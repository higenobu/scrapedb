4/13/2022,"If it’s true that in order to create something universal, you must pay very great attention to the specific, then with his fiction debut poet Keiran Goddard has written something like the universal love story. Written entirely in a kind of verse – by which I mean, a line break between almost every sentence – the three-part narrative goes like this: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets over it. Sort of. Both characters are unnamed. The narrator, a sometime essayist working a series of dead-end jobs, meets an editor. She has written four slim publications about Restoration drama (“smart people call short books slim books”). They fall in love; and she, at least, falls out of it. The plot is everyone’s plot, at some time or another – and that in itself is the heartbreaking thing about heartbreak. No pain is unique, and all pain is unique. This is the paradox that powers Hourglass. I have rarely read a book that captures so succinctly the way that all lovers must (at least a little bit) believe they are the only people to ever feel this feeling, and the way that that is (at least a little bit) true. Goddard’s narrator sees the world with the accuracy of a poet and the paranoid imagination of the socially inept: he speaks with a laser-cut and very funny precision that belies the way one imagines the world must see him. Whether he’s cutting armpit holes out of his T-shirt to attend a funeral, showing a child at the swimming pool a picture of guillotines, or being frogmarched out of a party by his furious girlfriend for crimes he’s not completely sure he understands, our narrator makes perfect sense to himself. And, occasionally, to her. It’s the fact of his making sense to her that makes her love him: nobody else around him can see what he wants, and why he does the things he does. The world of Goddard’s novel exists vividly on the page and yet to the narrator he is the only real person in it. Even the (ex-)girlfriend orbits him, in his telling, like a satellite moon. Which is, of course, the narcissism of the heartbroken. It is how it feels to be grieving; and this novel handles grief deftly and strangely. The city is “filled with wet cardboard”; he bins “whatever is bothering [him]”, such as wooden spoons and the toaster and the spice rack; he screams at a Boy Scout in the supermarket. He tears receipts into confetti at his mother’s funeral and walks until his feet bleed and tries to run a marathon one drunken morning, wearing his jumper from the night before. Hourglass sits somewhere between prose and poetry; somewhere between millennial sensation Hera Lindsay Bird, say, and a Joycean stream-of-consciousness. Virginia Woolf called Ulysses the work of “a queasy undergraduate scratching his pimples”, and there’s something sticky and masculine and physical about Hourglass: all sweat, and spit, and skin growing over Biro lids lost to an itch under pungent plaster casts. It makes the book alive. It’s disturbing, in the way that looking at the world – and at love – through someone else’s eyes would be. There is often an artfulness to novels written in a capital-S Style: novels in verse, novels in aphorisms, novels (like this one) that are not prose, but not not prose. But the style here feels like work in the way that being a person is work; and specifically, perhaps, the way that the unnamed narrator finds being a person to be work. He tries – God, how he tries – to be human like everyone else. He wants to be ordinary, and fears he is not; he wants to be extraordinary and fears he is not. He is, of course, both. “Love is the constant worry that someone else is dead,” the narrator tells us near the beginning, yet this is a book about someone learning to be alive; learning to love – if that’s not too big a word – oneself, and through that, the world.

4/13/2022,"The Florida legislature will allow Governor Ron DeSantis to take the lead on redrawing the state’s 28 congressional districts, a highly unusual move that will probably diminish Black political power in the state and allow Republicans to further distort the state’s map to their advantage. State legislatures, including Florida’s, usually draw a proposal for a plan that the governor approves or rejects. DeSantis vetoed the GOP-controlled legislature’s proposed congressional districts on 29 March after proposing his own map that would increase the number of GOP seats while eliminating two districts represented by Black Democrats. Leaders in the legislature said on Monday that they would not try to draft a new plan ahead of a special session next week, but instead were waiting for DeSantis, a likely 2024 presidential candidate, to submit his own plan. “We are awaiting a communication from the Governor’s Office with a map that he will support. Our intention is to provide the Governor’s Office opportunities to present that information before House and Senate redistricting committees,” legislative leaders said in a Monday memo. The legislature approved a plan earlier this year that would have given Republicans an 18-10 advantage in the state’s delegation. DeSantis’s proposal would have given Republicans a 20-8 advantage. DeSantis appears focused on eliminating two congressional districts with sizable non-white populations. One of those is Florida’s 5th congressional district, which stretches from Jacksonville to Tallahassee, is 46% Black and represented by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat. He has also targeted the state’s 10th congressional district, which is majority non-white and is represented by Val Demings, another Black Democrat. “The Florida legislature is caving to the intimidation of DeSantis and his desire to create additional Republican seats in Congress by eliminating minority-access districts,” Lawson said in a statement. “Again, I am not surprised, but disappointed with the legislature’s inability to fulfill their constitutional duties as elected officials without political interference from DeSantis.” Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Republican strategist in Florida who has since left the party, told the Washington Post that Republicans were “prostrating themselves” for the governor. “It’s just all about maintaining and acquiring power and holding on to office,” he told the Post. “What we’re witnessing is a mile marker on the road to one-man rule in Florida, at least for the time being.” The Florida legislature passed two versions of the 5th congressional district earlier this year to try to satisfy the governor, but DeSantis rejected both. His office argued that lawmakers had unlawfully sorted voters based on race. One version also lowered the share of the Black voting population, and DeSantis’s office said they violated a provision of the state constitution that says the state cannot make it harder for minority voters who meet certain criteria to elect the candidate of their choice. That rationale is “headspinning” and “inconsistent”, Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, tweeted. The governor’s office essentially argued that the maps violated the US constitution by taking race into account too much and the Florida constitution for taking race into account too little. So to recap: According to Gov. DeSantis, the compact (primary) version of FL-5 **at once**violates the US constitution because it was drawn to preserve minority power and the Florida constitution because it diminishes minority power. 10/ pic.twitter.com/zEXAPK0doG As for the “backup” version of FL-5, Gov. DeSantis argues that it complied with the Florida constitution (by keeping Black percentages similar) but violates the US constitution because to keep the Black percentages the same, you had to pay too much attention to race. 🤷🏻‍♂️ 11/ pic.twitter.com/yXY11LVDuW On the federal level, however, DeSantis’s rationale echoes what the US supreme court has signaled about the Voting Rights Act recently. The court’s conservative justices have repeatedly voiced skepticism about the use of race in redistricting and are making it harder for litigants to show it is necessary to consider race when drawing district lines. DeSantis, a former congressman, is eager for a court fight over Florida’s maps, NBC News reported. He also is taking aim at a 2010 amendment to the Florida constitution, overwhelmingly approved by voters, that sets guardrails on the redistricting process. Part of that amendment says districts cannot be drawn to abridge “the equal opportunity of racial or language minorities to participate in the political process or to diminish their ability to elect representatives of their choice”. “I think our dispute very well may lead to saying that Florida’s redistricting amendments are not consistent with the 14th amendment’s equal protection clause,” DeSantis said in March. Republicans hold a 6-1 majority on the Florida supreme court. The legislature is set to convene from 19 to 21 April for a special session on redistricting. Florida, Missouri and New Hampshire are the last three states completing congressional districting. So far, there are 181 Democratic-leaning seats, 182 Republican-leaning seats, and 34 highly competitive seats among the 435 seats in the US House, according to FiveThirtyEight.",News/US news,Florida Governor DeSantis given power to gerrymander state’s electoral maps,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/13/florida-legislature-governor-ron-desantis-redrawing-electoral-maps
4/13/2022,"I am Dutch and, after marrying my British wife, I applied for a spouse visa. My passport was required, and I was advised it would be returned within eight weeks. Eight months later, I still do not have it. I twice escalated the issue with the Home Office and was promised a response within 15 working days, but heard nothing. Eventually, I was advised to make a formal complaint and was told, weeks later, it had not been upheld as there was no standard timescale for visa applications. I involved my MP, who got no further. This has caused many problems as I have to produce it as ID to receive my Dutch pension and I have been unable to visit my family. Apparently I can request my passport back for an emergency but that would cancel my application and I would lose the £1,033 fee paid.JV, Rhydymwyn, Flintshire My inbox echoes with the pain of visa applicants who’ve endured months of limbo. When I contacted the Home Office, it took a couple of days to discover a problem that your months of calls and emails failed to expose. It claims you wrongly ticked a couple of boxes on the application form, which resulted in you being classed as a refugee. Refugee applications, which take about six months to process, do not incur a fee, and the Netherlands is not noted for its human rights abuses. It is therefore alarming that no one twigged at the outset that you had been put on the wrong track, or at least questioned you further. You say you and your wife repeatedly checked the form to identify any causes for the delay and dispute that you ticked the wrong boxes. Your visa was issued and your passport returned within four days of my intervention. Others facing unreasonable delays should detail the impact on them in a formal complaint to the Home Office, which must respond within 21 days. If it doesn’t, they could, subject to legal advice, submit a pre-action protocol threatening court proceedings and, if that has no effect, apply for a judicial review.

4/13/2022,"In terms of elusiveness, it is the Bigfoot or Loch Ness monster of the bird world, so rare and undetectable that the US government declared it extinct last year. But the ivory-bill woodpecker is, in fact, still alive and pecking in the forests of Louisiana, a team of researchers has claimed. A series of grainy pictures and observations of the bird, which had its last widely accepted sighting in 1944, show that the scrupulously furtive woodpecker is still holding on in the swampy forests of the US south, according to the team’s new research, which is yet to be peer-reviewed. A three-year quest to find the woodpecker involved scientists trudging through an undisclosed portion of Louisiana woodland to observe the bird and take audio recordings. Unmanned trail cameras, set up to take pictures on a time lapse, and a drone were used to capture photos of the creature. Steve Latta, the director of conservation at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh who led the effort, said each member of the team had encounters with the ivory-billed woodpecker and often heard its call, which has been described like hearing a child puff into a tin trumpet. Latta himself saw the bird fly upwards in front of him, showing the distinctive white edges to its wings. “It flew up at an angle and I watched it for about six to eight seconds, which was fairly long for an ivory-billed woodpecker,” he said. “I was surprised. I was visibly shaking afterwards. You realize you’ve seen something special that very few people had the opportunity to see.” The size and the markings of the bird captured in the photos is strong evidence that it is not another woodpecker, such as a pileated or red-headed woodpecker, Latta said. “It reinforced to me that, yes, this bird does exist and left me feeling a sense of responsibility to protect it for the future,” he said. Ivory-billed woodpeckers were once relatively common, stretching from the Carolinas through the south-east US to Texas. They were, or are, the largest woodpeckers in the US, with the males sporting a distinctive red crest on their heads. They enjoy feasting on insects that accumulate in the bark of recently deceased trees. Their numbers started to drop sharply in the 19th century due to human interference with their habitat and overhunting, with their scarcity spurring collectors to hunt them further as valuable specimens. They were also eaten by poverty-stricken people of the time who turned to devouring the woodpecker, wild turkeys, gopher tortoises and other wildlife. With just a few of the birds occupying largely inaccessible forests, confirmed sightings, let alone clear pictures, became almost impossible. Last year, the US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), after years of listing the woodpecker as critically endangered, declared the species extinct. “No one has held a camera and got a picture of one in years because it’s a scarce bird in tough swampy habitat and they don’t want people close to them because they’ve been shot at for 150 years,” said Geoffrey Hill, a biologist at Auburn University who took part in another, largely frustrating, trip to find the bird in Florida in 2005. “They have better eyes than we do, they are high in the trees and actively flee people. They aren’t great thinkers but they have developed a pretty simple strategy to avoid people.” Hill said Latta’s research was “very interesting” and that he thought it likely that the bird pictured is indeed an ivory-billed woodpecker. He added that the FWS was premature to decide the species was extinct and that several dozen could still be holding on in forests across the south. “Some people cannot believe a bird can defy documentation by modern humans because we have such dominion over nature but it is endlessly interesting because if it has done that, it’s one pretty impressive bird,” Hill said. “People who are into birds are fascinated by them. Ivory bills couldn’t care less, though. They hate all people.”",News/Environment,"Back from the dead?

4/13/2022,"In the 1996 essay Tierra del Fuego – New York, French cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard juxtaposes Ushuaïa with Manhattan. “After the ends of the earth, the centre of the earth,” he writes. “But each gives the impression of being on another planet.” The UK’s forgotten towns have an analogous relationship with its celebrated, over-touristed ones. They copy big-city retail concepts but fall short. They emulate tourist honeypots but can’t deliver the goods. Many lesser-loved places are botched simulacra of London, while also existing in opposition to it – for the capital’s prosperity is rooted in their broken dreams, dashed hopes, spent retail and extinct services. Scotland is the Tierra del Fuego of the UK and has many Ushuaïas. Ayr, Stranraer, Thurso and Montrose all qualify as “ends of the earth”. But Cumbernauld, more even than these, has found itself the butt of nasty jokes, snidey mock-prizes, and general putdowns for half a century. As a new town, it never garnered the ironic appeal of Milton Keynes, and yet its megastructure has a brash muscularity that knocks out the competition. Conceived in the 1950s, it fairly claims to have the UK’s first shopping precinct and “the world’s first multi-level covered town centre”, but this is earmarked for demolition. Called the Alien’s Head by some, it divides the town even more than the motorway, the M80, which pierces its heart, and was built “between 1972 and 2011”. Tourist boards would have us stroll around bosky Palacerigg country park or the museum, which, in turn, points visitors out to the Antonine Wall – the turf fortification built by the Romans between the Firth of Forth and Firth of Clyde. But there is no need to take the bait. If you want to wrap yourself in the central belt – at once Scotland’s most populous and, for outsiders, the most forgotten, most passed-through, most cliche-free region of Burns’ “haggis” land – take a wander around the cold concrete and cracked pavements of Cumbernauld. Lincolnshire is best defined by lacks and absences. It has none of the barge-punting prettiness of East Anglia. It’s too far east to be in the East Midlands, too far south to be in the north. It is ostentatiously flat, Lincoln Cathedral’s grandeur in large part due to the surrounding planitude. Grantham, too, is beguiling. On the Great North Road and East Coast mainline it is nonetheless eminently ignorable, belonging to that swathe of satisfactory and serviceable English towns (Aldershot, Colne, Kenilworth, Wokingham etc) travel and leisure industries have shunned. But in the never-ending post-Thatcher era, all Britons should pay a ruminative visit to Grantham much as Chinese “red tourists” hit the Mao trail. For here lies a museum displaying the epoch-defining PM’s lumpy bed, school hockey stick and copy of the score of Handel’s Messiah, the Victorian Guildhall where her dad was mayor in the 1940s, and her birthplace at the corner of Broad Street and North Parade. It was, famously, her dad Alf Roberts’ grocer’s shop, but later became a restaurant (the menu included Chicken Supreme Margaret) and is now “a chiropractic clinic and holistic retreat” where you can have hot needles stuck in you while lying exactly where young Maggie dreamed of monetarism, redundancy notices and hot dates with Adam Smith. Take a purposeful walk around the town’s airy centre, with its solid buildings and Isaac Newton statue, and you sense Thatcher probably imagined Grantham a model to replicate across the nation. Does the town love its most famous daughter? The plaque on the wall of the former grocer’s is very small indeed. A 10ft plinth on St Peter’s Hill awaits a statue of the Iron Lady commissioned three years ago. In February 2021, local sculptor Mark Robla gifted the town a plaster Maggie head on a spike made from office chairs, irrupting from a handbag. The official effigy is scheduled to be unveiled later this year. Stanley in the Falklands has had a bust of its saviour on show since 2015. Hard to locate in Greater Manchester’s mega-sprawl and, once found, still lost in time, Leigh exudes the particular sadness of once-proud pit towns. In 1828, the first passenger railway in Lancashire (take note, Liverpool, Manchester) was laid between Bolton and Leigh; the town hasn’t had any trains since Beeching axed the last track in 1969. Leigh was annexed politically by Wigan in the 1974 boundary debacle. The once-mighty textile industry frayed decades ago (glorious Spinners Mill is on Historic England’s Heritage at Risk register). Even rugby league is no source of comfort: Leigh Centurions have never managed to extend their sojourns in the Super League beyond a season. At first glance, pedestrianised Bradshawgate looks like your usual post-Amazon high street, all downmarket/empty shops in crumby postwar husks, but look up and you’ll see vestiges of late Victorian and Edwardian Leigh realised by local architectural hero James Caldwell Prestwich (1852-1940). The grand, mainly redbrick edifices are in need of conservation, but Prestwich’s Leigh Friendly Co-operative building is bold and confident, while his baroque town hall, with ornamental cupola and stained-glass windows representing the town’s industries, is a masterpiece. Inside the entrance is a museum where you learn Leigh folk are known as “lobby gobblers”, in reference to a stew made by lobbing anything available into a pot, and to distinguish them from the “pie eaters” of Wigan; that native heroes include Ian McKellen and Georgie Fame; and that Tom Burke, a miner born in 1890, went on to have an improbable career as an opera singer, met Puccini, performed alongside Nellie Melba at Covent Garden, and was nicknamed the “Lancashire Caruso”. Opposite the town hall is the brutalist Turnpike Centre, AKA Leigh Library, built in 1971 by the architectural firm of JC Prestwich & Sons, no less. The large, geometric relief, cast in concrete, is by William Mitchell, who provided abstract adornments for Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral and Birmingham’s Quayside Tower. Leigh has a branch of the Leeds-Liverpool Canal and a link to the Bridgewater Canal. Follow the latter’s towpath to the Lancashire Mining Museum at Astley Green, resting place of the last remaining winding machinery and headgear from the Lancashire Coalfield. Another, much-loved mining legacy is Pennington Flash, a small lagoon formed by subsidence; bream, perch, roach, rudd, tench, pike and a few big carp haunt its seedy depths. Non-anglers can stretch their legs in the surrounding country park. A Welsh hotelier once told me the key to selling upmarket accommodation was nailing the “Gee-you” market. I had no idea what he was talking about till he explained that he was referring to the GU postcode. “More than half of our clients are from Guildford or near to it,” he said. “They have the money and they are close to the motorway.” Flip the socio-economics and descend on a town slated by many as a dull-as-death dormitory. Guildford has the kinds of things you’d expect – castle, museum, high street, SUVs. But more surprising is Hinemihi, a wooden Māori meeting house shipped here from New Zealand’s North Island in 1892, and the remains of one of the oldest synagogues in western Europe – built in 1180, and buried under the floor of Waterstones. The neo-gothic cathedral, gloomily austere, featured in the 1976 film The Omen. Guildford is superbly well connected, with three major lines converging here, express services to London (32 minutes, stopping once at Woking), buses to Heathrow and a train to Gatwick. Before the pandemic, there was a direct train to Newcastle. The 153-mile North Downs Way, which has its eastern extreme at nearby Farnham, passes through Guildford on the old Pilgrim’s Way. As GU-ers would expect, the slopes of the Surrey Hills AONB are always balmy and many are clad in chardonnay vines. For millions of Lancastrians, Cestrians, Mancunians and suburban scousers, Runcorn is a symbol of sunshine, freedom and hope. Since its erection in 1961, Runcorn Bridge (later officially renamed Silver Jubilee Bridge) was the only way to cross the River Mersey and Manchester Ship Canal to enter north Wales. From here, the onward journey to Colwyn Bay, Rhyl and Llandudno was a hazy, happy, heady blur, with even the jams on the old A55 part of the fun. The parallel railway bridge, a drab, span-less affair, delivers a comparable hit to the car-less. Since 2017, the sweeping Mersey Gateway has given the estuarine location its own Golden Gate. Cynics might argue that all this talk of transit is what Runcorn deserves, but it’s time beach-bound travellers pulled over to take a look around Runcorn. For there, in the shadow of the bridge, sit the remnants of the old new town, envisioned by Arthur Ling in 1964, with state-of-the-art neighbourhoods like Castlefields, lauded at the time as “the future of sustainable living”, and modernist Southgate Estate, with its porthole windows, designed by James Stirling. Demolition has razed much of the utopian dream, but the memory lingers in the maze of cul-de-sacs and bargain-basement Bauhaus-esque terraces. The 12-mile dedicated Busway, with its “stations” and raised section at Shopping City (designed by Fred Roche, of Milton Keynes’ fame), can be toured on bus numbers 1 and 2. Runcorn’s burgermeisters have opted thus far to list only ancient sites like Norton Priory (Grade 1) – famous for its St Christopher statue – and 18th-century Bridgewater House (the duke’s pad while the canal linking Runcorn, Manchester and Leigh was under construction). While these are venerable landmarks, the last remnants of the new town also deserve some kind of protection. Footpaths along the canals and Weaver Navigation provide escape routes out of Runcorn, but urban geographers will prefer to cross the bridge, looking out over the bird-beloved swirl of sandbanks and rivulets, weather and waves, that make the Runcorn Gap an ever-changing Turner masterpiece, before plunging into Widnes, the chemical capital of Lancashire.",Lifestyle/Travel,"Where tourists seldom tread, part 2: five great UK towns left out of the guidebooks",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/apr/13/where-tourists-seldom-tread-cumbernauld-guildford-leigh-runcorn-grantham
4/13/2022,"An “insidious and coordinated” effort between lawmakers and extremist groups is under way to undermine American democracy, according to a new report. On Tuesday, the nonpartisan civil rights organization National Urban League released the annual report in its analysis series The State of Black America. The report, called Under Siege: The Plot to Destroy Democracy, outlines the “conspiracy and the urgent case for a national mobilization to protect and defend our most sacred constitutional right”. It focuses on four main tactics that it says are used in this effort: gerrymandering, voter suppression, misinformation and intimidation. In 2021 alone, 20 states have leveraged census data to redraw congressional maps, it noted. The new maps proposed by Republican state lawmakers “are no more than modern-day gerrymandering that strips voting power away from communities with Black and brown voters”, the report said. It also listed 34 laws passed in 19 states between January 1 and December 7 2021 that make it more difficult for people to vote. In addition to shortening the window to apply and deliver mail ballots, those laws limit absentee voting lists, restrict assistance in returning a voter’s mail ballot, reduce the availability of mail ballot drop boxes, and increase barriers for voters with disabilities, among other restrictions. “The burden of these laws – strict photo ID requirements, the elimination or restriction of Sunday voting, voting by mail and early voting, and the closing of polling locations – overwhelmingly falls on Black voters,” Marc Morial, president and CEO of NUL, said in the report. “Since the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, the United States has seen a steady rise in disenfranchisement practices giving one party an edge over the other. But never before has the nation seen such an insidious and coordinated campaign to obliterate the very principle of ‘one person, one vote’ from the political process.” According to the report, state legislatures in 18 states carried over at least 152 restrictive bills from the 2021 legislative season. Additionally, in states that allow lawmakers to “pre-file” bills ahead of the next legislative season, at least 96 bills in 12 states would make it more difficult for voters to cast their ballots. The report also laid out steps that have been taken to sabotage elections, including discrediting the vote and outright aiming to establish one-party rule, as demonstrated by the Stop the Steal movement. It also notes an uptick in intimidation of election officials since 2020, with one in six local election officials saying they have personally experienced threats, and a quarter concerned about being assaulted because of their role. Additionally, the report found that election workers are resigning and retiring at alarming rates, with one in five saying that they are “very” or “somewhat” unlikely to continue serving through 2024. It cites a poll conducted by the strategic research and consulting firm Benenson Strategy Group in which an overwhelming majority of Black Americans said they believe strongly in the power of their vote to make a difference when it comes to social and racial justice, police violence and economic opportunity. However, nearly as many agree that elected officials are not doing enough to protect their voting rights and are in fact “doing more to limit voting rights than to protect them”.",News/US news,Report raises alarm on ‘insidious’ effort to undermine US democracy,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/13/insidious-effort-to-undermine-us-democracy-report
4/13/2022,"The Framework Laptop is a modular, repairable and upgradeable notebook PC that aims to spark change in the world of computers and prove things can look good, work well and still be fixable at home. Launched by US firm Framework Computer, this new laptop has a similar feel to the excellent Fairphone, providing customisation options and the ability to upgrade parts rather than having to replace the entire device. It even ships with the only screwdriver you will need to take it apart. The Framework is available in a DIY version, which you put together yourself and starts at £769 ($749) with the bare bones of the system, leaving you to add your own RAM, storage and operating system. Pre-built laptops start at £999 ($999) running Windows 10. On the outside the Framework looks like pretty much any modern laptop. It is reasonably thin at about 16mm, light at 1.3kg, and made of recycled aluminium. The body of the laptop feels solid and well made, and the hinge is rock solid and opens all the way to 180 degrees, but the lid feels more flimsy, with more flex in the screen than some when opened and closed. The 13.5in screen is crisp and bright but is not a touchscreen, which is unusual for a Windows laptop. The deck has your choice of language keyboard and a fairly large standard trackpad. It even has a good 1080p webcam at the top of the screen with a physical switch to disable it and the mics, and a good fingerprint scanner built into the power button for logging into Windows. Two speakers fire from grilles on the bottom of the laptop, which sound reasonably clear and can get fairly loud but lack any real bass. The sides of the machine hold more novelty: four modular ports that allow you to hot-swap between any combination of USB-C (USB4), USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, microSD and expandable storage drives. Costing less than £20 each, they are cheap enough to keep a collection for different tasks. It is a genius idea. Screen: 13.5in LCD 2256 x 1504 (60Hz; 201 PPI) Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7 (11th generation) RAM: 8, 16, 32 or 64GB Storage: 250, 500GB, 1, 2 or 4TB Operating system: Windows 10 Home or Pro Camera: 1080p front-facing Connectivity: wifi 6 (ax), Bluetooth 5.2, headphones, fingerprint scanner, choice of 4 ports, USB-C (USB4), USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, microSD Dimensions: 296.6 x 229.0 x 15.9mm Weight: 1.3kg The heart of the Framework is fairly standard for PC laptops. It has a choice of 11th-generation Core i5 or i7 quad-core laptop processor from Intel, which will have plenty of power for most tasks. Its Intel Xe graphics chip will not handle much in the way of gaming, however. The machine runs fairly warm, requiring the fans frequently even when just browsing heavy sites, and they are relatively noisy compared with the best, making them audible in quiet offices. Battery life of the top Core i7 version with 32GB of RAM was fairly short, lasting about six hours of work with the screen set to about 70% brightness. That is not awful, but mainstream competitors usually manage more than seven hours, with the best in the business able to last as long as 16 hours. It takes two hours to fully charge the laptop with Framework’s compact 60W charger, hitting 50% in an hour. Framework rates the battery to last for at least 1,000 full charge cycles while maintaining 80% of its original capacity. It can easily be replaced along with all the rest of the components, including the RAM and SSD. The laptop was awarded 10 out of 10 for repairability by the specialists iFixit. Framework will sell replacement parts and upgrades through its marketplace in the near future, but also supports third-party parts. The laptop’s housing contains 50% recycled aluminium and 30% recycled plastic. The pre-built models of the laptop ship with Windows 10 Home or Pro depending on the version, but can easily be upgraded to the latest Windows 11 or switched to Linux or another operating system. The laptop acts like any other Windows machine out of the box, but only some of the driver updates are available through Windows update for the time being. Others must be downloaded direct from Framework’s site, which is simple. The Framework Laptop comes in several different variations, including as a DIY kit that you put together yourself that starts at £769 ($749) for the barebones equipment, so you can add your own RAM, storage and operating system. Pre-built systems start at £999 ($999) with an Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, Windows 10 Home and four USB-C expansion cards. The model with a Core i7, 16GB of RAM and 512GB storage costs £1,399 ($1,399). USB-C and USB-A expansion cards cost £9; HDMI, DP and microSD cards cost £19; 250GB storage cards costs £70 and 1TB £150. The Framework Laptop is a marvel: a thin, light and well made notebook PC that you can easily take apart, fix, upgrade and add your own parts to, such as RAM and storage. There are not many laptops that can say the same. The modular ports are a great idea, too, allowing you to customise the selection on your laptop on an ad-hoc basis without the need for loads of dongles or adaptors. As a standard PC laptop it works well, with a decent keyboard and trackpad, good screen, great webcam, a good fingerprint scanner and your choice of Intel processors. None of these are quite as special as you can get on some of the very best mainstream laptops, but they are generally good. The worst bit is the battery life, which is a bit weak. At least you can replace it. Bear in mind that the expansion ports, motherboard and other unique parts will rely on Framework’s long-term support and availability to replace or upgrade, which is never guaranteed for new entrants. The Framework Laptop feels more of an enthusiast machine made by a right to repair startup, but truthfully there is nothing about the pre-built models that should deter mainstream buyers other than short availability. For the most part, the Framework is a standard laptop, albeit one you can take apart and upgrade if something breaks. Pros: modular ports, designed to be taken apart for repair or upgrade, can bring your own storage and RAM, good performance, made of recycled aluminium and plastic, well made, thin, light, good fingerprint scanner, good screen, great webcam, decent keyboard and trackpad. Cons: battery life could be better, runs fairly warm and fans can be noisy, no touchscreen, lid a little flimsier than the rest of the body.
