3/15/2022,"Tuesday commemorates 10 years since I founded the @IndigenousX account on Twitter. For those who aren’t familiar with what we do, IndigenousX began as a rotating Twitter account where a different Indigenous person would take control of the account for the week and tweet about … well, whatever they wanted to. I had written an article for our anniversary some time ago – reflecting, commemorating, celebrating the past 10 years of IndigenousX. This isn’t that article though. I don’t feel like celebrating right now. For all the positive changes that we have been a part of over the last 10 years, this week I am not feeling like we have seen much positive change at all. Not when it is so painfully clear that there’s still some Australian media who, after a police officer was found not guilty on all charges for the killing of an Indigenous person, appear happy to present the cop as the hero and the victim of the shooting as a villain. Our justice system put him on trial for his own death, and now our media are following suit. Most media organisations in Australia have Indigenous staff now, when many of them did not 10 years ago. Most of them have reconciliation action plans or now spell Indigenous with a capital ‘i’, or no longer use the term “blacks” when writing about Indigenous affairs. They still justify our deaths, though. They still refuse to let our communities mourn. They still pretend that white objectivity in Indigenous affairs is a thing. They still think our humanity is a topic suitable for debate among learned white experts and random media commentators alike. They still only employ Indigenous journalists when there’s a grant for it … then they’ll still ask that same journo to write an article criticising all the free money Aboriginal people get. I would have loved to celebrate IndigenousX’s anniversary – to have stopped for a moment to breathe, to reflect, to maybe even pat myself on the back for the decade that I poured my heart and soul into. Instead, I will do what we always do: try to provide comfort and support where we can, first and foremost, and then provide our platform and our resources to help those who want to speak truth, to create change, to say NO MORE. I will take the opportunity to say thank you, though. Thank you to everyone who has been a part of IndigenousX in any way this past decade. IndigenousX was created for lots of different reasons, but a very important one was because Australian media are so woeful when it comes to reporting on Indigenous issues. Often, in my view, maliciously so. While they justify our deaths, our communities mourn. IndigenousX will keep offering support where we can. We will keep making noise. We will keep providing a platform for our communities for as long as they want us to do so. We will keep showing up. And until we get justice, we will do our best to make sure Australia doesn’t get peace.

3/15/2022,"A Democratic fundraising organization has announced that it is filing a complaint to the Federal Election Commission in which it accuses former president Donald Trump of violating campaign finance laws by spending political funds for a 2024 presidential bid without officially declaring his 2024 candidacy. The American Bridge Super Pac, which filed the complaint on Monday, said in the complaint that “Trump has been illegally using his multi-candidate leadership PAC to raise and spend funds in excess of Commission limits for the purpose of advancing a 2024 presidential campaign. “His failure to timely file a Statement of Candidacy with the Commission is a clear violation of the [Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971].” Under federal election campaign rules, candidates are required to register with the FEC within 15 days of receiving contributions or spending more than $5,000 on a presidential campaign. The complaint uses Trump’s own words, including the address he delivered at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando last month, in which he said: “We did it twice and we will do it again … We are going to be doing it again a third time.” According to the complaint, Trump’s primary Pac, Save America, has spent over $100,000 weekly on Facebook ads and has “consistently raised more than $1 million per week”. “Save America’s ads are clearly an attempt to influence Mr Trump’s election to federal office in 2024,” the complaint says. Save America’s expenditures include those spent on Trump’s travels, events at Trump properties, rallies where Trump is a featured speaker and consulting payments to former Trump campaign staff. American Bridge has asked the FEC to “compel disclosure of any expenditures made to further Mr Trump’s candidacy, enjoin Mr Trump from further violations, and fine Mr Trump the maximum amount permitted by law.” In a statement reported by the Washington Post, Jessica Floyd, president of American Bridge, said Trump needs to be held accountable by Democrats and Republicans alike. “Whenever they are taking a break from calling for tax hikes for Americans and Obamacare repeal, Republicans are scrambling to see who can praise Trump the most – even as he continues his effort to grift his way back to the White House. They should be ashamed to support such obvious lies, and we should all see him for what he is and hold him accountable.” Trump’s team criticized the filing, calling it a “cheap gimmick” that revealed how the Democratic party “has become a dumpster fire that’s void of solutions and substances”. “America is spiraling into disaster because of the Democrats’ failures, and instead of reversing course, they are busy filing frivolous complaints that have zero merit,” Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich said.",News/US news,Trump accused of campaign finance violations in FEC complaint,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/15/donald-trump-accused-campaign-finance-violations-fec-complaint
3/15/2022,"We try to live our life here in Kyiv as normally as we can in the circumstances. We know how close we are to the line between life and death. When there is so much killing all around our only instinct is to survive. I walk around my beautiful city of Kyiv every day and I take photographs of some of the nicest places. I live in the centre of the city. Many things here have remained normal. There has been some shelling but so far we are OK. We are still able to buy all the essentials – meat, bread and milk – and the phone network here has been working perfectly. One thing that has changed is that people in the city have become nicer since the war started. In the shops everyone is so polite to each other. I was in the pharmacy queue and someone needed insulin. Everyone let that person go to the front of the queue. If someone is carrying bottles of water they will tell you where they managed to buy them. In some ways the Covid pandemic prepared us for the war. I work at the university here. I am a senior lecturer at the university. I was doing a lot of my work with students online. Now the war has started I am still working online. I have no military background or training but I do not want to leave my city. After 30 years of independence I do not want us to lose our democracy because of Russian aggression. My parents and grandparents were critical of the government during the Soviet era. I can remember that life when I was growing up – going to a department store that had just two things in it – a very simple type of shoe and blankets. Our only window through the iron curtain were two English language publications – Moscow News and the Morning Star, which could only be found at certain kiosks. I can sum up in one word my feelings when the Soviet Union was dismantled – “euphoria.” We do not want to return to that so we are fighting the Russian aggression. There are not many people out on the streets but some kind of normality has returned. Everything in the city is still alive and flourishing. Although many women with young children have left, the city is still gender balanced! When the war started everyone in Kyiv was in shock, paralysed. But we have adjusted. The worst part of this is my fear for the safety of my parents. My dad is 84 and completely blind and my mum is 81. They and their cat Monkey are stuck in their apartment in the city of Sumy, where there has been a lot of bombing. It is too dangerous for me to go to them and impossible for them to evacuate. They hear many explosions but so far they are OK. I have never before seen our railway station so crowded with people leaving for Lviv and other parts of western Ukraine. But many refuse to leave Kyiv. We are determined to stay. We know the Russians are encircling us and there is an expectation in the city that something will happen in the next few days. Putin wants to take us back to the last century. We must return to the 21st century. I have many friends internationally and they have expressed so much solidarity with us. The most positive thing to have come out of the war is our increased unity. We are strong here in Kyiv. The outside world cannot see all of the resolve and determination of Ukrainians. They only see the tip of a very big iceberg. Underneath that tip we are even stronger.",News/World news,‘People have become nicer’: one resident describes life in Kyiv,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/resident-describes-life-in-kyiv-ukraine-russia
3/15/2022,"Before the war, it was the official city app to buy tickets for transport and pay for parking or utility bills in the Ukrainian capital. Now Kyiv Digital has been transformed into a life-saving tool that warns of air raids, and directs people to the nearest bomb shelter or garage with petrol supplies. With the help of the country’s chief digital transformation officer (CDTO) – the Kyiv deputy mayor Petro Olenych – the app’s focus was changed in just 24 hours as Russia invaded. It has already issued thousands of warnings and alerts, shared maps of bomb shelters, disseminated information on how to support the army and provided links to official sources of information. According to a spokesperson for CDTO the app now has 1.5 million users and is one of the top free applications in the Ukrainian app store. “Kyiv Digital has become the essential tool for warnings and alarms in the city. The novelties include a map of bomb shelters, map of available pharmacies and the access of insulin, a map of grocery stores, a map of points with free water and bread, pet shops, humanitarian headquarters, and more,” the spokesperson said. “The app has been around for a while and l found it very useful [before] because you could pay for parking on it and buy tickets for buses and trolleybuses,” said Denys Malakhatka, a scientific academic researcher. “Since the war started, they changed the app. They now send you alerts about when to take shelter and I also really like the fact that they let you know when the potential attack has ended,” said Malakhatka. “I think it’s great that they tell you when it’s over and you can relax,” he said. In peacetime the underground train service was used by about 1 million people a day; now the stations serve as emergency shelters for an estimated 15,000 Kyiv residents, who bed down on platforms and in hallways once the city’s curfew begins at 7pm. The Metro is running on one track every 90 minutes while the opposite platform has stationed carriages for people to wait, sit or sleep. As part of the digital war support, the government has also beefed up wifi access across the city, providing internet links to more than 200 bomb shelters to maintain emergency information links and allow people to keep in touch with relatives. “We must adapt our services and we have done. Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities are working more cohesively and productively than ever. The reason is obvious. We defend our country, our cities, our residents, our parents, our children and our future. This is our home so we will fight to the last,” said Olencyh in a statement. Google has also rolled out rapid air alert systems for android phones in Ukraine at the request of the Ukrainian government. “This work is supplemental to the country’s existing air raid alert systems, and based on alerts already being delivered by the Ukrainian government,” it said on a company blog. Not everybody appreciates their phone apps’ change of focus to the conflict. “There are eight to 10 alarms a day – and when I’m sleeping I don’t want to hear them as well,” said Kyle Kondratiev, a lightning designer-turned humanitarian volunteer humanitarian. But for many other Kyivans, the app has become essential, not least because it includes a map of working petrol stations. With public transport severely limited, and many petrol stations closed, drivers without the app can face long queues or lengthy searches for fuel.",News/World news,Kyiv transport app is transformed into life-saving war information tool,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/kyiv-transport-app-is-transformed-into-life-saving-war-information-tool
3/15/2022,"Two people have been charged over alleged online threats against the Labor deputy Senate leader, Kristina Keneally. The Australian Federal Police revealed a 29-year-old man and a 41-year-old woman will face court in April after raids on Tuesday over the alleged threats, made via a social media messaging service. Keneally, Labor’s home affairs spokesperson, confirmed on Sky News the charges relate to threats against her and praised police for their efforts and investigation. In a statement, the AFP said the man from Harrington Park in Sydney’s west and the woman from Maitland had “been served court attendance notices following [alleged] threats made against an Australian senator via a social media messaging service”. “The man and woman are expected to face Sydney central local court on 13 April 2022,” it said. The AFP said it will allege in court that the man and woman were “responsible for sending two separate threatening messages on 21 and 22 November 2021 which threatened or advocated violent acts”. AFP investigators executed search warrants at the homes of both people on Tuesday and seized a mobile phone for further examination from the man’s Harrington Park residence. The man has been charged with threatening to cause harm to a commonwealth public official and the woman with using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. The offences are punishable by up to seven years and up to five years in prison, respectively. Keneally told Sky News that as the matter is “before the court” she would “not go into the content or circumstances” of the messages. She thanked the federal police for taking threats to parliamentarians “seriously”. Australian law enforcement agencies are increasingly worried about threats to the safety of politicians, particularly in the wake of extremist and violent rhetoric directed at them during anti-lockdown protests. Keneally told Guardian Australia: “Having served as a state MP, [New South Wales] premier and been in public life for 20 years this is not the first time I have received threats, and not the first time police have had to make arrests.” “But what is different in the current context is that there’s a level of anger and frustration, particularly coming out of Covid, that is sometimes expressing itself in very challenging ways.” Keneally said she was aware of “many incidences where members of parliament have been on the receiving end of attempts to threaten and harass”. “The AFP have spoken about [the] need to upgrade security coming into the federal election – that is important for members, candidates and the general public.” Violent incidents overseas including the alleged stabbing of Sir David Amess and murder of MP Jo Cox in the UK have also put authorities on alert.",News/Australia news,Two people charged over alleged online threats against Labor senator Kristina Keneally,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/two-people-charged-over-alleged-online-threats-against-labor-senator-kristina-keneally
