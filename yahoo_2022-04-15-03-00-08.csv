4/15/2022,"STORY: Russia warned on Thursday (April 14) that if Sweden and Finland join NATO, Russia would deploy nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles in an exclave in the heart of Europe. Both Finland, which shares an 810-mile border with Russia, and Sweden are considering joining the U.S.-led military alliance. Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that should Sweden and Finland join NATO then Russia would have to strengthen its land, naval and air forces in the Baltic Sea, where Russia has its Kaliningrad exclave sandwiched between Poland and Lithuania. Medvedev also said he hoped Finland and Sweden would see sense, or they'd have to live with nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles close to home. There could be no more talk of a ""nuclear free"" Baltic, he said. One town on Finland’s border with Russia is Imatra, home to 26,000 people casting a nervous eye towards their eastern neighbor. It used to welcome Russian tourists, but since Moscow launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine, Imatra fears receiving less benign arrivals. That worry has prompted Finland to consider joining NATO, which would be a major pivot in its security arrangements. Katri Latt is a resident of Imatra: ""We have so far seen Imatra as a very safe place and we still think so but I believe the thoughts of the people here have now changed in the way that a small fear has now appeared and Russia, the country next to us, is a little different to other countries and you cannot necessarily always trust what they say, so maybe people should be prepared for the fact that we might have to leave quickly."" Finland has long avoided disagreements with Russia for the sake of friendly relations, but Prime Minister Sanna Marin said on Wednesday (April 13) it must be ready for all kinds of responses from Moscow now it's weighing NATO membership. She said a decision would be made in the coming weeks.",Politics/Reuters Videos,"Russia warns Sweden, Finland over joining NATO",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-warns-sweden-finland-over-164803377.html
4/15/2022,"A man in India has died by self-immolation after his boss reportedly demanded to have sex with his wife in exchange for a transfer.

Gokul Prasad, a 45-year-old technical lineman, was feeling distressed after his boss, junior engineer Nagendra Kumar, offered to process Prasad’s transfer if he sent “his wife [over] for a night.”

Both were employed at the Palia power station of Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation Limited (UPCL) in Lakhimpur Kheri, India.

Prasad had asked for a transfer so he could work closer to home and not commute as much, according to his wife.

On April 9, Prasad proceeded to pour diesel fuel over his body and light himself on fire in front of Kumar’s office. He was rushed to the hospital where he succumbed to his injuries and died the day after.

Before his death, Prasad recorded a video complaining about years of harassment and work abuse that he received from Kumar and his aide. Prasad claimed that Kumar was abusing his power, and he blamed him and his aide for his later death.

Prasad said he reported the abuse to the police, but he did not receive assistance and “nothing happened.”

Gokul’s wife explained that he was harassed by Kumar and his aide for three years before falling into “depression” while “taking medication.”

“He went into depression, and started taking medication, but they did not spare him. He was transferred to Aliganj and was facing difficulty in traveling. So he asked for a transfer closer home. They told him, ‘get your wife to sleep with us and we will get you transferred,’” Gokul’s wife said.

She also claimed that nobody came to help Gokul when he set himself on fire, and Kumar had “stood there and watched.”

Sanjiv Suman, a senior police officer, stated that Kumar and his aide are now facing charges for abetment to suicide and intentional provocation under the Indian Penal Code. Both have been suspended from UPCL.

“The lineman had alleged that the junior engineer used to demand money and made vulgar statements when he sought a transfer. We have registered a case. At the department level, the junior engineer has been suspended and an inquiry ordered. The case has been registered under the abetment to suicide charge,” Suman said.

4/15/2022,"Russia has been accused of ""abandoning"" the bodies of 1,500 soldiers in Ukraine as tens of thousands die during Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Ukraine has claimed more than 20,000 Russian troops have been killed since Putin ordered his troops to begin their offensive on 24 February. While the number has not been independently verified, last month a Nato source put the numbers of Russian soldiers killed at between 7,000 and 15,000. The Kremlin has remained largely quiet about how many of its soldiers have died as a result of Putin's invasion, though it has acknowledged suffering ""significant losses"". Read more: Russian commander deliberately killed by his own demoralised troops, Western officials claim On Wednesday, Ukrainian authorities claimed Russia has left behind the bodies of their troops killed, and offered the mothers of the dead to have access to their loved ones. The defence ministry tweeted: ""There are more than 1,500 corpses of Russian soldiers in the morgues of the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Their command isn’t even thinking about bringing them home. ""Dnipro deputy mayor Mykhailo Lysenko said that the city authorities are ready to provide Russian mothers with access to the bodies of their sons, since the government that sent them to die in Ukraine lacks the courage to do so."" Oleksiy Arestovych, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, said on Friday that the Kremlin had refused to accept the corpses of 3,000 of its regular soldiers early in the war. Watch: Emergency services clear rubble from destroyed Kyiv fire station He told The Washington Post: “They said, ‘We don’t believe in such quantities. We don’t have this number. We’re not ready to accept them."" There have been prior reports of the Russian army leaving its dead behind. On 3 March, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy claimed the invaders had brought crematoriums with them to dispose of their dead. He told reporters: ""The Russian people are dying here, nobody is counting them, people dying in this war. Do you know they have brought a cremation chamber with them? ""They're not going to show the bodies to their families. They're not going to tell the mothers that their children died here."" Morale is said to be dropping amongst Russian troops, and Western officials claimed last month that an army commander was killed by a group of demoralised soldiers fed up with the scale of losses during the invasion of Ukraine. The commander of the 37th rifle brigade, named by officials as Colonel Medvechek, is understood to have been run over by one of his own soldiers who had grown frustrated by his unit's heavy losses. Russia is believed to be sending top leaders to the frontlines in a bid to bolster low morale among troops. Putin had reportedly hoped to take over Ukraine in a matter of days, but now seven weeks into the conflict troops have retreated from areas in the north to focus on renewed assault on cities in the south of the country. Since being pushed out of those areas, Putin has faced fresh accusations of war crimes. Ukraine accused Russian troops of killing hundreds of civilians in the town of Bucha, just outside of Kyiv, following their retreat. On Thursday, Russia was expelled from the UN Human Rights Council after delegates voted 93 to 24 to remove them following allegations of Russian soldiers carrying out mass killings, rape and torture. Instead Western intelligence has indicated forces are regrouping for a new eastern offensive in the Donbas region. Zelenskyy told BILD he expects intense fighting in the coming days. ""It could be a big war in Donbas — like the world has not seen in hundreds of years,"" he told the German outlet. ""We will go on defending our country until the end.""",News/Yahoo News UK,"Russia accused of 'abandoning' 1,500 troops killed in battle in Ukraine",https://news.yahoo.com/russia-ukraine-corpses-war-troops-soldiers-104022075.html
4/15/2022,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday said it is “nice” of the state of Texas to bus illegal immigrants from the border to Washington, D.C., hours after the first bus out of Texas arrived blocks away from the U.S. Capitol building. Last week, Abbott announced that Texas would be sending willing illegal immigrants to Washington, D.C., by bus and plane in response to the Biden administration’s recent announcement that it will lift Title 42, a Trump-era public-health order that has allowed U.S. border officials to quickly expel migrant families to Mexico, next month. “These are all migrants who have been processed by CBP and are free to travel, so it’s nice the state of Texas is helping them get to their final destination as they await the outcome of their immigration proceedings — and they’re all in immigration proceedings,” Psaki said when asked during a press briefing about the first bus arriving on Wednesday. The bus carried dozens of migrants from the Del Rio sector in Texas. The migrants were released into Texas’s border communities by the federal government after coming to the U.S. from Colombia, Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, Fox News reported. After the bus arrived in the Capitol, the migrants checked in with officials and had wristbands they were wearing removed before being allowed to leave, the report added. Psaki had previously called Abbott’s policy a “publicity stunt.” The state has sent an undisclosed number of buses to the border communities impacted by an influx of migrants, but the Texas Division of Emergency Management said each bus “has the capacity and supplies necessary to carry up to 40 migrants.” The state has a pool of up to 900 buses for the operation, Texas Division of Emergency Management Chief Nim Kidd said last week, according to CNN. “From the [Rio Grande Valley] to Terrell County, a large majority of the communities that originally reached out for support through this operation have now said that the federal government has stopped dropping migrants in their towns since the governor’s announcement on Wednesday,” Seth Christensen, chief of media and communications for TDEM, told Fox News last week. Meanwhile, Psaki doubled down on her criticism of another of Abbott’s policies during the press briefing on Wednesday, this time calling the governor’s order to carry out “enhanced safety inspections” of vehicles that pass through ports of entry a “political stunt.” Abbott directed the Texas Department of Public Safety to carry out the enhanced inspections last week over concern about “cartels that smuggle illicit contraband and people across our southern border.” The governor suggested there will be an increase in smuggling when Title 42 ends. On Wednesday morning, Psaki released a statement that said: “Governor Abbott’s unnecessary and redundant inspections of trucks transiting ports of entry between Texas and Mexico are causing significant disruptions to the food and automobile supply chains, delaying manufacturing, impacting jobs, and raising prices for families in Texas and across the country.” During the briefing, Psaki was asked if she is blaming Abbott for inflation. “Well I think we’re trying to state the facts of what is another political stunt that we’re seeing happen and the impact of it,” Psaki replied. “What we’re seeing is right now, factually, there’s over $1 million in trade crossing over the U.S.-Mexico border every minute. These actions are impacting people’s jobs and the livelihoods of hardworking families in Texas and across the country.” She went on to say that the “unnecessary inspections” are causing “significant delays, which are resulting in a drop in commercial traffic of up to 60 to 70 percent in some ports.” However, the country has been contending with soaring inflation for months now. A Labor Department report released Tuesday showed the Consumer Price Index, a major inflation gauge measuring the cost of the average household basket of goods, came in at 8.5 percent over the 12-month period ending in March. The rise is the largest 12-month increase since the period ending December 1981.
