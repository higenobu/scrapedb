1/20/2022,"Primark is to axe 400 jobs across its UK business as the fast fashion retailer cuts back its store management roles in response to rising cost pressures, despite a significant bounceback in trading in recent months. Primark, which operates 191 stores in the UK and more than 400 in total internationally, said it was creating a new management level role as part of the reorganisation but overall expected the changes to leave it with about 400 fewer retail managers in the UK.  The company added that although supply chain pressures had now eased it still expected that longer shipping times would “continue for some time”. Primark said that while sales at its UK stores in the 16 weeks to 8 January had been “well ahead” of last year, despite an impact from the spread of Omicron, they remained 10% below pre-pandemic levels. “The changes we are proposing will deliver a simplified and more consistent management structure across all of our stores,” said Kari Rodgers, the UK retail director at Primark. “[It will] provide more opportunities for career progression and offer greater flexibility, all of which are designed to help us provide the best possible experience for both our customers and colleagues. We are now focused on supporting our colleagues who are affected by these proposed changes and will be going through the consultation process.” The cuts come as Primark reported a Christmas boom, with sales at £2.6bn in the 16 weeks to 8 January, a 36% increase over the previous year when the retailer saw widespread closures of stores in the UK and Europe because of the pandemic. The company said that while sales at stores in retail parks had surpassed pre-pandemic levels, sites in city centres continued to show a lag in the rate of recovery. Overall, Primark said sales were down 5% compared with the same period in 2019, pre-Covid, helped by the opening of 25 stores since the start of the pandemic, and 11% on a like-for-like basis stripping out the impact of the expansion. Looking ahead, Primark expects sales up to April to be “significantly better” than last year. Primark’s business in the US, where it plans to open 100 stores, continues to be a “standout” performer with sales up 4% on pre-Covid levels on a like-for-like basis and 37% compared with total levels two years ago. “If the shackles continue to loosen on the vital Primark arm, the group should be poised for stronger prospects and the market consensus of the shares as a strong buy echoes this possibility,” said Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor. Primark’s parent company, Associated British Foods (ABF), which owns brands including the hot drinks firms Ovaltine and Twinings as well as a sugar business, said that margins had been squeezed at its other businesses as inflation pushed costs higher, with price rises on its products taking time to feed through to the bottom line. “All businesses have experienced inflationary pressures in raw materials, commodities, supply chain and energy,” the company said. “Margins in grocery and ingredients were impacted where sales price actions have lagged the effects of input cost inflation. “All businesses have been focused on mitigating the effects of significant cost input inflation, particularly in energy costs.” Overall, ABF reported a 16% rise in total group revenues to £5.5bn.",News/Business,Primark to cut 400 managers to offset rising costs,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/20/primark-to-cut-400-managers-to-offset-rising-costs
1/20/2022,"Every once in a while a player comes along who redefines their position. We’ve seen positionless defensive players, hybrid safety-linebacker types. We’ve seen corners who can play in the slot or happily kick out to the boundary. Over the past decade, we’ve seen the rise of the polar bears, tight ends as adept at mauling fools in the run-game as they are running down the field as their team’s finest receiver.  And yet, as a football collective, we’ve waited for the unicorn: The running back-wide receiver. There have been flashes. The spread revolution gave rise to tweener players, those who could align in the backfield as a running back or wriggle out to the slot (or wider) to catch passes. Getting the ball to your best athletes in space became the doctrine of offensive football. In the college ranks, the likes of Tavon Austin and Percy Harvin embraced football’s move from a tough, between-the-tackles, thumping sport to one based on the principles of pace and space. But in the NFL, coaches have always favored specialists over the hybrids. They didn’t need a receiver to line up at running back – they had a world-class running back to do that. They didn’t need a running back to flex out as the outermost receiver, they had all the elite receivers they could handle. These were professionals, masters of their craft; there was no time for split duty. In Deebo Samuel, the unicorn has finally arrived. Samuel is the San Francisco 49ers’ best running back and the team’s best receiver. He may be the finest running back and the finest receiver in the league, at least in terms of efficiency and explosiveness. If he’s not, he’s as near as makes no difference. There is a childlike glee to Samuel’s brilliance. To watch him is to see an athlete who is stronger and faster than the 21 other human beings on the field – and those 21 humans are among the strongest and fastest athletes on the planet. Samuel brings intricacy for the nerds and loud highlights for when you just want to see cool athletes doing the coolest things. With the ball in his hands, he’s a leaning, bobbing, weaving, stop-on-a-dime phantom. Deebo Samuel is a dominant weapon on offense 🚀 @19problemz told Kyle Shanahan 𝙇𝙀𝙏'𝙎 𝙂𝙊! and put the ball in the box.Watch more @nflfilms highlights tonight on @paramountplus. #FTTB @49ers pic.twitter.com/dwweo42ILo The Niners offense now revolves around finding an ever-increasing number of ways to get the ball to Samuel, or leveraging his threat into easy yards for everyone else. Smart teams have always sought crossover skillsets. During the heyday of the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady Patriots, the team would bring in a back whose receiving chops outdid their running skills. They would move that player around to identify mismatches. But that was the player’s value – as a moving chess piece that helped Brady identify coverages more than as an individual runner or receiver. Their flexibility was a big percentage of their overall value. It was about what they did without the ball as much as what they did with it. With Samuel, it’s about how he damages defenses when the ball winds up in his hands, no matter his starting position. So far this season, he has played 555 snaps split out as the outermost wide receiver, 222 in the slot, eight as an in-line ‘tight end’, and 93 as a running back. The trend of moving him around on a snap-to-snap basis is relatively new, though. As recently as Week 9, Samuel had played only seven snaps lined up in the backfield all season. Since then, he’s averaged nine snaps in the backfield per game (21% of his snaps). The past two games – the do or die game against the Rams in Week 18 and the playoff matchup with the Cowboys – represent the only times this season he’s taken more snaps as a running back than as a slot receiver, the position from which Kyle Shanahan typically initiates all the fun and games in his offense. Of course, lining up in a bunch of spots in and of itself is no great skill. It doesn’t matter where you align, or in how many spots, if you stink at most or all of them. And that’s where Samuel breaks the convention: He’s the best at everything he does. His output is jarring: 1,770 total yards, at an average of 13 yards per touch, with 14 touchdowns tacked on for good measure. He’s a walking first down; a human touchdown. If you’re into the fancier metrics you’ll know Samuel holds something of a monopoly over all of the league’s key categories, be it as a back or receiver. He led the NFL in the regular season in yards per reception. He’s averaging more than 10 yards after the catch per reception. To put that in context, no other receiver broke the seven-yard barrier during the regular season. If that’s not enough, Samuel leads the league in yards per route run on targets of 20-yards or more down the field. That’s comfortably ahead of Ja’Marr Chase. It’s streaks ahead of Davante Adams, Stefon Diggs, and Tyreek Hill. The numbers keep coming. Samuel finished second in the league in yards after contact per attempt. He finished second in the league in ‘breakaway’, which measures the percentage of a player’s rushing yards that come on runs of 15-yards or more. You have to go all the way down to [rubs fake glasses, squints a little] 60th on the list to find the next non-running back. There is not another wide receiver in the top 200. He also happens to lead the league in the Guardian’s own Holy Bleep Is That Possible Should That Be Allowed Is That Even Fair™ metric. Players of Samuel’s ilk used to be interesting footnotes and quirks. There are players now sprinkled around the league who take snaps in the backfield and outside as a receiver on a semi-consistent basis. Cordarrelle Patterson had a late-career resurgence in Atlanta this season. Curtis Samuel has filled a similar role in Carolina and Washington. Rondale Moore moves all over the shop in Arizona. In Buffalo, the Bills’ Isaiah McKenzie is able to nudge close to Samuel’s output. Yet Samuel is the only multi-positional weapon assuming the creative pulse of a playoff offense. He is the only one piloting a championship contender, helping to elevate a flawed quarterback – by way of an outstanding offensive line. He is the only one who runs the ball with a battering-ram style then breaks out in ballet when asked to run routes. It is tempting to paint Samuel as the first of a new kind of positionless player. But to do so would be to understate the absurdity of his season and talent. Samuel hasn’t pushed up against the idea of positional designations but fractured them altogether. There are running backs, there are receivers, there are hybrids, and then there is Deebo Samuel.",Sport/Sport,Deebo Samuel: the walking first-down who has broken the idea of NFL positions,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/deebo-samuel-san-francisco-49ers-nfl-wide-receiver-running-back-position
1/20/2022,"Guillermo del Toro hits us with a spectacular noir melodrama boasting gruesomely enjoyable performances and freaky twists. He shows us that in spite of the old song, there are in fact a couple of businesses like showbusiness: psychoanalysis and crime. Del Toro conducts us into a fairground of fear with his usual love of the fantastical and the hallucinatory, the same adoration of classic golden age Americana and some spasms of body-horror violence. Thankfully though, it’s without the supernatural whimsy that sometimes threatens to drown his movies in twee. Nightmare Alley is adapted from the 1946 novel by pulp author William Lindsay Gresham, who had a great fascination for the US’s sleazy carnies, circuses, travelling shows and magicians with their weird shimmer of the occult. (It’s something to ponder that, after their divorce, Gresham’s ex-wife Joy Davidman moved to England and famously married CS Lewis.) Nightmare Alley was first filmed in 1947 with Tyrone Power in the lead role, and now it’s Bradley Cooper taking on the haunted, saturnine part of Stan Carlisle, a guy with no money and a violent past who needs to disappear for a while.  Stan wanders into a travelling carnival whose most stomach-turning attraction is a haunted-house show that plunges punters into a nightmare inferno of the Last Judgment, a hideous honeycomb of bulging eyes. Stan finds that the hatchet-faced guys running things can always use people like him to help with hard, dirty work, paying a few bucks and asking no questions. But Stan is a cut above the usual hobos and losers; he’s a likely fellow with a personable manner and an inquiring mind and he’s intrigued by the cheesy mind-reading act run by Zeena (Toni Collette) and her boozy husband Pete (David Strathairn). Instantly, Stan grasps the art of the mind-reader: to learn the secret verbal codewords fed to him by his partner, but also to use his natural observant powers to see what sort of a person is in front of him and pick up on clues. After a sinister act of violence – of which he is all too capable – Stan marries fellow carnival huckster Molly (Rooney Mara) and moves with her to Chicago where their high-class act in hotel showrooms becomes the toast of the town. And then he comes across someone else in the mind-reading game: Lilith Ritter, gorgeously played by Cate Blanchett, a fashionable psychoanalyst with peroxide hair, a slash of lipstick, a gigantic art deco consulting room and a brace of wealthy clients. She makes him a terrible offer. This film has a horribly ingenious premise and there is something chilling in the central concept: Stan’s mind-reading spiritualist routine, though deeply dishonest, is in fact founded on a set of truths about human nature which are revealed to the seedy huckster but not to the educated person who might affect to despise the showman’s preposterous act. Every person thinks their background is their own unique secret, and everyone is indeed haunted by a certain someone, someone who is always near them (the bogus spiritualist will solemnly declare that this person has a ghostly hand on their shoulder), someone whom they love and hate at the same time. That person is a parent. And Stan’s mind-reading is, in its way, entirely genuine. There is a brilliant setpiece when Lilith is in the audience for Stan’s classy show, smirkingly sceptical and demanding to ask the questions herself, not letting Molly use her codewords, and challenging Stan to tell her what is in her handbag. Will Stan be exposed in front of all his tuxed fans? Stan removes his absurd blindfold, fearlessly returns Lilith’s gaze and gives a magnificent reply, with intuition to rival Sherlock Holmes. Del Toro’s film shows us that Stan, and tricksters like him, are a kind of priesthood, a brotherhood of ruined and corrupt knowledge, imprisoned in a hell that only they can see.  Nightmare Alley is released on 21 January in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Nightmare Alley review – Guillermo del Toro’s fairground of fear is a class act,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/20/nightmare-alley-review-guillermo-del-toro-bradley-cooper-cate-blanchett
1/20/2022,"Some of the government’s most prized new animal welfare policies are being put on pause in what supporters see as a sneaky attempt to ditch the “woke” measures altogether. Senior sources in the Conservative party have confirmed to the Guardian that a series of policies including a ban on trophy hunting imports, stricter sentences for puppy thieves and a ban on live exports of livestock have been put on pause after a campaign led by Mark Spencer, the chief whip.  The minister responsible for the policies, Zac Goldsmith, is understood to have heard the news just before taking off on a flight to Ecuador. Spencer, who is a farmer, is understood to be less than keen on the animal-friendly policies touted by Boris Johnson and his influential friends including his wife, Carrie, and Lord Goldsmith. Others within the party, in rural constituencies, have privately complained that the animal welfare policies have been campaigned for by people who live in cities, and that it has made them unpopular with landowning, shooting donors and voters. Many backbenchers hope the next Tory leader is unlikely to continue with the legislation as it is unpopular with influential figures in the party. Allies of Johnson have told the Guardian that the policies are “as good as dead” if the prime minister faces and loses a vote of no confidence. Goldsmith said: “It’s not just that the future of government is uncertain. So too is continued leadership on climate and nature. The measurable truth is that we are now world leaders and have moved things massively on nature – abroad and here (with much more to come) If this PM goes, that very likely ends.” A senior MP who has called for Johnson to resign but supports the animal welfare legislation took a more balanced view. The MP said: “This could be a sort of attempt to coerce the parliamentary party into thinking ‘we have to keep Johnson because otherwise we won’t get the animal welfare legislation’. “We are keeping an eye on it, and certainly will not be supporting any leadership challenger who does not plan to quickly move this legislation through parliament. The thought has crossed all of our minds that another leader might try and dilute the legislation. We have to fight hard against that.” The influential Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation, which includes Carrie Johnson, Dominic Raab and Lord Goldsmith among its patrons, plans to throw its weight behind any challenger who backs the welfare legislation. Sir Roger Gale, the MP for North Thanet and a spokesperson for the group, said: “We’d be looking for undertakings from any future leader that they would support this legislation. We would be looking for support for the excellent programme of animal welfare legislation the public voted for in the 2019 manifesto.” Friends of Spencer said he was grumbling about the animal sentience bill, which passed in the Commons on Tuesday night, as many farmers believe it could make their lives more difficult and cause welfare standards to be raised on farms. The bill has come under fire from backbenchers as it enshrines in law the feelings of animals including lobsters and fish. There are beliefs that this could harm the fishing industry and that it could turn off traditional Tory voters who see such policies as “woke”. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Animal welfare is an absolute priority for this department. We are getting on with the job, and just last night the sentience bill passed in the House of Commons.” Animal welfare campaigners previously criticised the government for delaying a law that will clamp down on trophy hunting and prevent people from buying harmful animal experiences such as elephant tours. The start of its passage through parliament has been postponed, with ministers accused of “dithering”. The bill was first hoped to be published before the summer recess in July, but has since been pushed back repeatedly. Lorraine Platt, a campaigner who runs the CAWF, told the Guardian: “We support our prime minister Boris Johnson’s commitment to advancing animal welfare and the world-leading legislation currently passing through parliament to end live animal exports and much more. “It is paramount that this excellent programme of legislation continues its passage for the sake of millions of animals who are set to benefit from this government’s reforms. Any pause in the passage of the current animal welfare bills will be detrimental and deeply unpopular with the British public. We shall be looking to ensure that this powerful suite of legislation continues forwards.” Spencer could not be reached for comment.",News/UK news,UK government puts animal welfare policies on pause,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/uk-government-puts-animal-welfare-policies-on-pause
1/20/2022,"When I started working in fashion in 2016, one thing was clear: this was a white, female and thin industry. André Leon Talley, who died on Tuesday, at 73, was defiantly, unapologetically and fabulously none of these things. Talley’s passing isn’t just the tragic end to the life of a figure who revolutionised perspectives towards clothes. It’s also the silencing of a voice who represented what fashion could be: the triumph of the outsider in a world of cookie-cutter conformity. People of colour, like myself, are constantly being told to make ourselves smaller and to hide our true selves if we are to survive unscathed in an overwhelmingly white world. Talley was heroic because he never followed these rules. He never apologised for his booming voice, which pronounced in sing-songy staccato sentences, his unconventional body shape or his blackness, despite knowing that racism is “part of the fabric of our existence”, as he wrote in his memoir, The Chiffon Trenches.  Like many creative aesthetes, Talley survived the cruelties of his childhood (including sexual abuse) by escaping into a world of culture. He grew up in North Carolina, living with his grandmother, as was the norm for many in those days in the black community (he called her “Mama”). He craved to live in the world painted for him by Diana Ross, Nina Simone and Laura Nyro. While he yearned for the elegant luxuries depicted in a book about the Titanic, which he found at his aunt’s house, copies of Vogue provided him with an aspirational safe space, where, he said, “bad things never happened”. At Brown University, Talley’s mind was expanded by Rimbaud and Baudelaire, while he found a new aesthetic freedom to express himself through his style. Inspired by Naomi Sims, the first black model he saw in Vogue, Talley took to wearing makeup from the Japanese kabuki theatrical tradition, and a floor-length admiral’s coat. When he returned home to North Carolina for a holiday, Talley’s mother refused to attend church with him and scorned, or “shaded”, his “Phantom of the Opera look”. Ouch. But, no matter – the bird was out of its cage, and he moved to New York and found work as an unpaid assistant to Diana Vreeland at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Through Vreeland’s patronage, Talley found reception work at Andy Warhol’s Interview magazine, before becoming the publication’s resident fashion expert. Deep friendships with Karl Lagerfeld and Halston intertwined with jobs at WWD, W, Ebony and, later, Vogue, where he became creative director under Anna Wintour, having started as a fashion news director in 1983. It was a momentous first for fashion: “As an African American born in the ugly and racist Jim Crow south, I understood how monumental this was,” Talley wrote. “I was the first.” His presence and perspective at Vogue prefigured today’s reality, in which there are more people of colour in fashion editorial, and inclusivity has become a growing norm on the catwalk (if not in fashion magazines), while, at the very least, conversations about diversity are not laughed out of the boardroom. But for many of the years between 1983 and 2018, when Beyoncé appeared on the cover of Vogue’s September issue, shot by Tyler Mitchell, the first black photographer to shoot a cover in the magazine’s 130-year history, Talley was the only person of colour on the front row at fashion shows. As he wrote in The Chiffon Diaries: “none of my contemporaries have seen the world through black eyes”. Through fashion writing, Talley transcended this racism. “My blackness was not important,” he said, reflecting on writing up a particularly electrifying Yves Saint Laurent show report. “What mattered was that I was smart.” Talley was always a larger than life figure, whose theatrical presence thrummed with a joie de vivre: he would sashay in the face of the glacial, mannered world in which he worked, and described the racism and homophobia he experienced in fashion as “subtle” and “casual” (he was nicknamed “Queen Kong” in Paris fashion circles). And yes, Talley never compromised on what he felt was important: a fierce advocacy for the vision of the fashion designer. His death is the extinguishing of a unique, inspirational light.

1/20/2022,"As a therapist, Nick Blackburn is attuned to the use of story as decoy; when what we want to talk about is too painful, or obscured from our view, misdirection and displacement edge in to fill the gaps and silences. He is aware of the danger of being seduced by those compensatory stand-in stories, of being, in the words of psychoanalyst Jacques-Alain Miller, captured by your patient’s delusion. “Your work as a clinician,” Blackburn quotes Miller as saying, “is not to understand what he says. It’s not to participate in his delusion. Your work as a clinician is to understand the particular way, the peculiar way he makes sense of things.” But The Reactor is not a book about Blackburn’s attempts to understand what underlies his patients’ stories, rather a fragmentary unrolling of his own particular, peculiar way of making sense of the death of his father. Here is a man whom we meet only in glimpses, the details of whose biography and identity are less significant than his absence and the manner in which he is unavailable to both his son and the reader. This is not a memoir that attempts to piece together a mass of wayward strands and details of a life in order to provide a vaguely comforting sense of the person who once inhabited it. Instead, it is a reckoning with the reality that loss can be just as cataclysmic even when its terrain and contours are indistinct and may never come into perfect focus.  That reckoning is itself variously and sometimes luridly disguised. Blackburn’s most closely tended alternative narrative is that of the explosion of the fourth reactor at the nuclear power plant at Chernobyl in 1986, a disaster that the author initially acquaints himself with via YouTube films, becoming mesmerised by visual details that seem as though they might come from a dream or a fairytale: golden corridors of corrugated yellow metal, polished marble, “the red forest and the crumbling dachas”, “catfish fattening in still waters”. But it is scientific process that really appears to compel him, and the way it can be made to function as a metaphor for the violent experience of bereavement: “Radioactive atoms want to become stable again,” he writes, “so they release energy until they get back to a balanced state.” Throughout, Blackburn ponders the half-life of grief, its power to contaminate the lives around it, its insidious unpredictability. As anyone who has endured loss might understand, it also alters time, the reality that preceded it coming to seem both implausibly far away and crushingly, inescapably, present. There is both a becalming and a turbulence that also characterises Blackburn’s attempts to write about it: “I get anxious because in a way creative activity always has a manic quality, dancing and dancing like the red shoes, like a nuclear meltdown.” His response to the mania of creation is to seek ever more connections: alongside Chernobyl, he takes us into the life, and death, of fashion designer Alexander McQueen; the music of Joni Mitchell, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan (“Bob says: Life isn’t about finding yourself, or finding anything, life is about creating yourself, and creating things”); the 2018 documentary about a “free love” commune, Wild Wild Country, and Ingmar Bergman’s The Seventh Seal; Derek Jarman and Billy Elliot, Sister Wendy and Ian Curtis. Thinking of Fleetwood Mac makes him think of the Manhattan project, which makes him think of the poet Thomas Wyatt, after which he reflects: “Connecting things (in hindsight) can be really exhausting sometimes, don’t you think?” And sometimes, that feeling of exhaustion extends to the reader, who may reasonably think that another’s tenuously linked thoughts and preoccupations are not unlike other people’s dreams: fascinating to them, and possibly to their therapist, but not as utterly captivating to the outsider as they would wish. A page on which the word “Nuclear” is followed by a line break and then the word “Unclear” and nothing else is not, let us be truthful, especially illuminating. But The Reactor does have considerable power. It movingly evokes the psychic mayhem of parental loss, that point at which, whatever one’s relationship, the idea of origins and foundations comes under scrutiny, if not outright assault. And while it confirms the isolated, individual nature of grief and can hardly be thought of as a work of consolation, it also suggests that the attempt to tell one’s story, and the attempt to listen, is not to be underrated.

1/20/2022,"Lorraine Kelly is pulling at her hair and shrieking: “Aaarrrrgghhh!” It is the morning after news leaked about Downing Street’s bring-your-own-booze party, held during those painful early months of lockdown and attended by the rule-flouting prime minister himself. Even after discussing it on her weekday breakfast TV show, Lorraine, the presenter is still trying to process the revelations. “Just when you think you can’t make it up!” she says. “Jesus, honestly, if they told me now that they’d had a masked ball for 1,000 people, like the Met ball or something, I’d just go: ‘Yeah, yep.’ And why on earth do they need an inquiry into it? If I said to you: ‘So, you went for a wee coffee today at Starbucks?’ you either did or you didn’t; you don’t need an inquiry into that!”  You can probably trust Kelly when it comes to taking the country’s pulse: she has been a regular fixture on our TV screens for 37 years. She says scandal such as this gets to her because she has spent time over the past two years speaking to those who couldn’t say goodbye to loved ones, or had to limit numbers at funerals. “And we tried, when things were really dark, to find something to hold on to, whether it was amazing NHS workers or Captain Sir Tom. There was a sense of communities coming together. But we’ve kind of lost that a bit and it’s become toxic and fractured again, which is really disheartening.” Kelly is known for her on-screen warmth – smiley eyes, that melodic Scottish lilt – and those qualities certainly help camouflage her no-nonsense interviewing approach. Piers Morgan once called her an “iron fist in a velvet glove” and she admits to liking that; there are plenty of public figures who have sat on her sofa unprepared for the punchy line of questioning. She says her approach comes from her early reporting days. “I started on local papers and you did everything,” she says. “Some of the Scottish football managers back then looked a bit askance at a woman doing sport, but it was great, because they were totally disarmed.” I am certainly disarmed by Kelly’s video-call setup, which is almost as makeshift as my own: camera aimed up her nose, a tangle of coats hanging in the background, a picture of Spock framed in the corner of the screen. (“Oh that?” she says, spinning around with a grin. “I’m the geekiest geek there ever was.”) Chatting to her is a joy – her answers tend to pick up steam, barrelling downhill until I have to step in to ask the next question, at which point she slows herself down, beams a big smile and tackles the next one. We speak shortly after her live morning show has aired. Today’s involved a spot of hula-hooping with Dr Hilary Jones (“My pelvis won’t thrust!”), a chat with Martin Lewis about the cost-of-living crisis, a feature on a dog that has learned to talk, encouragement for people to get their Covid booster shots and some innuendo about playing with balls. Our own chat ping-pongs around in a similar way, from space travel to transgender rights, via knitting and her experience covering national tragedies such as Lockerbie and Dunblane. We even alight on her tax affairs, which have been a source of amusement – and criticism – since a judge ruled in Kelly’s favour against HMRC in 2019. The judge said Kelly was not liable for the bill in question because she was a “theatrical artist” performing the “friendly, chatty and fun” role of Lorraine Kelly on TV. Before all that, though, we discuss the show’s viral social media clips. In recent years, these have focused on the times when Kelly’s sunny on-screen persona has been tested beyond breaking point. In 2019 alone, she dismissed an awful Jennifer Arcuri interview with a caustic: “S’point in that?” and caused the temperature in the GMB studio to drop by several hundred degrees when she was asked by the host Susanna Reid if she remembered working with the Tory MP Esther McVey during her days on GMTV. Kelly responded with a stone-faced: “Yep … yes, I do.” Is it fair to say that the past few years have seen Kelly go rogue? “I think I’ve always done that,” she says. “It’s interesting, people’s perceptions of what I do. People, especially politicians, think they’re coming on to do a cosy little show, and it’s really not! If you’ve done something wrong, you will get held to account. So, when Jennifer Arcuri was in … honest to God, I was sat in the studio watching her being all coy, going [here, Kelly does what can only be described as a moronic tittering noise] and she said literally nothing. So I just said: ‘What’s the point of you being on?’ Who do you think you are to do that to the viewers? You should never take them for granted like that.” Did she plan to say her bit to Arcuri in advance? “You can’t plan it! It’s a live show. Most things that make the headlines are off the cuff. Of course, you have to have an edit button – and that’s where the training and experience comes in. I know the legals, how far you can go, because I’ve been doing it for a very long time. But at the same time I’ve got this glorious freedom to speak my mind.” Kelly says she only thinks about the show, not how a 20-second clip might look on Twitter, although that is undeniably how many people get to see her highlights these days. Her frosty encounter with McVey was a particular hit, with many wanting to know the story behind it. McVey has implied that it stems from the fact that, back in the day, she was promoted to partner Eamonn Holmes, but Kelly maintains it was McVey’s stance on gay rights that got her goat. Kelly is a longstanding LGBTQ+ ally who received Attitude magazine’s Honorary Gay award in 2015 and has appeared on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK as a guest judge. “I thought to myself: she’s come out and said the most appalling things about a section of society that are really hard done by and have enough going on without someone like that having a pop at them. And I didn’t really say anything, did I? But isn’t it amazing what you can say without saying anything?” Recently, Kelly has been getting a different kind of reaction – abuse from anti-vaxxers, because of her insistence that viewers should get a booster. “Loads and loads,” she says. “But even if I disagree vehemently with someone, you still have to have the debate.” This idea of no-platforming people leaves her uncomfortable. “Debate helps crystallise your own thoughts – and you should allow yourself to be challenged. There are some times when it’s not the right thing to do, but in general you can’t just say: ‘I hate you, I don’t want to engage with you, goodbye.’ “You don’t want is to make martyrs of people who have opposing views. You don’t want them to be … well, we call it ‘cancelled’, but what really is cancelled? Sometimes it’s better to give people space to talk, particularly toxic politicians. Let them talk for a wee bit; they’ll tie themselves up in knots and contradict themselves, then you can go in for the kill.” When Kelly invited Kathleen Stock on to her show, she again seized the chance to debate someone with whom she disagreed. Formerly a professor of philosophy at the University of Sussex, Stock resigned from her post last year amid campus furore over her gender-critical stance on trans rights. “I thought: let her speak,” says Kelly. “You’ve got to.” During the interview, Kelly questioned whether Stock had been “cancelled”; Stock agreed that she had a bigger platform now than before (“And I intend to use it”). Kelly is proud that they were able to have the conversation on national TV. “I was able to disagree with her. Because I think trans women are women and trans men are men. That’s my belief. And, at the end, people can make their own mind up. But it was important for me to say that and to show my support.” When I watched the clip, I wondered if there had been a moment that crystallised Kelly’s advocacy of trans rights. Speaking now, she offers one up. “I remember getting the school bus to school in East Kilbride and the driver was a lady called Jane. Jane was a trans woman and she was going through the process of transitioning. And you can imagine the abuse she got, because it was the 70s. But I used to chat to her, got to know her as a person, and she was a brilliant woman. I often wonder what happened to her. “But I’ve got a lot of pals who happen to be trans or they happen to be whatever … who cares?! They’re all just human and that’s a part of who they are.” She sighs. “People should just be a bit more tolerant, because trans people are currently going through, I think, what gay people went through. It’s a hard road, it really is.” Kelly was born in 1959 to two working-class teenagers from the Gorbals area of Glasgow. Her mum, a homemaker, was a Catholic; her dad, a TV repairer, was a Protestant. Her maternal grandmother thought they should put her up for adoption, but her parents were in love and held firm. Their house was tiny, with an outside toilet, but full of love and books. Kelly had planned to study English and Russian at university, but instead went to work on the East Kilbride News (it is a point of pride that, in 2004, she was made the rector of the University of Dundee, so her mum could finally have a picture of her in a gown up in the house). After moving to TV, Kelly reported on two major tragedies in 1988, the Piper Alpha oil explosion in the North Sea (“I really don’t know how anyone got out of that alive”) and the Lockerbie air disaster. “Weirdly, the thing I remember most was not the horror and the smell and the devastation – but everybody in town taking down their decorations. It was just before Christmas and when I saw people doing that it suddenly hit me. I went back to the place I was staying and just howled.” After Lockerbie, Kelly thought she would never have to do anything harder. “But Dunblane was the worst by a mile,” she says of the school massacre in 1996. “That hit really hard.” It is a mark of Kelly’s approachability that one of the bereaved mothers, Pam Ross, got in touch with her after the tragedy – not for TV, but to talk privately. Ross had lost her five-year-old daughter, Joanna, and invited Kelly to attend the funeral at her home. “I was there in the house. And Joanna was also in the house, upstairs, in her bed, in a little white coffin with her wee nightie on. And one thing I always remember is that her handprints were still on the window.” Kelly is still in touch with Ross; proper friends even after all these years. “She’s got a big birthday coming up!” she beams, before returning to the tragedy. “A lot of people think that after Dunblane there was an instant ban on guns. There wasn’t. The parents had a massive, massive fight on their hands and they were told by one Tory in particular that it was all a kneejerk reaction. And do you know who that was? Boris Johnson.” (“Nanny is confiscating their toys,” Johnson wrote in 1997. “It is like one of those vast Indian programmes of compulsory vasectomy.”) Kelly has seen it all during her time on the breakfast sofas. Daytime TV has been pioneering, she says proudly, because it talks about things a lot of other media ignores. “You couldn’t even say the word ‘cancer’ when I started. It was nuts! Now we have breast and testicle examinations on the show.” She proudly namechecks its Change + Check breast cancer campaign, which has helped save 53 women’s lives since it launched.With her trademark being down to earth, the tax ruling caused problems for her. She says she is happy to address this, “because I’ve never got my chance to put my side of the story across”. Despite all the media coverage around whether or not she was “performing” the role of Lorraine Kelly, the case rested on whether she was an employee of ITV or a freelancer, as Kelly and ITV believed she was. At one point, she was prepared to pay the outstanding fee, which was only a fraction of the total bill of £1.2m quoted in reports. But then, she says, the tax office started demanding interest on it. “So I thought: no, not having this. So we took them to a tribunal and it got thrown out. The judge said it wasn’t a borderline case and we shouldn’t have ever had the hassle. “I don’t want people to think I would do anything to get out of paying what I should be paying. That goes to the core of who I am and how I was brought up. I’m a firm believer in the NHS, a firm believer in better education and housing and looking after people who can’t help themselves. I was brought up in a very working-class background where you pay your dues.” So where did this notion of Kelly being an actor playing the Lorraine Kelly role come from? “Now that I can laugh at,” she says. “It was, sadly, a bit of a misinterpretation, but I knew what [the judge] meant. Obviously, it’s given people great hilarity and I can live with that.” Tax issues behind her, Kelly is looking ahead positively. Lockdowns attracted a bigger, younger audience to her show and Kelly says it has managed to hold on to a lot of those. Amid all this Tory drama, I wonder what she thinks about the opposition – and Keir Starmer in particular. “He seems a very decent man, but maybe needs a wee bit of a rocket up his bum?” she says. “Because there are times where there does seem to be an open goal and you’re like …” She grabs at her hair again and shouts: “Aaarrrrgghhh!” Lorraine is broadcast on ITV on weekdays from 9am and on ITV Hub",Arts/Television & radio,"‘Let them talk for a wee bit, then go in for the kill!’ Lorraine Kelly on tough interviews and going rogue",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/20/let-them-talk-for-a-wee-bit-then-go-in-for-the-kill-lorraine-kelly-on-tough-interviews-and-going-rogue
