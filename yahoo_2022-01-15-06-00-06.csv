1/15/2022,"A Florida police sergeant has been relieved of his supervisory responsibilities and is under investigation after he was filmed grabbing an officer by her throat, according to officials. Sunrise police shared body camera video of the Nov. 19 incident with NBC News, but the footage was muted with faces blurred, except for the sergeant's. Police officers were arresting a ""verbally and physically resistive"" suspect, accused of a violent felony, when the unidentified sergeant arrived and became aggressive with him, Sunrise Police Chief Anthony W. Rosa said in a statement. The sergeant engaged in a verbal altercation with the suspect sitting inside a patrol vehicle and “escalated” the encounter, according to the chief. The police body camera footage showed the sergeant ducking his head inside the patrol vehicle to talk to the suspect and holding a can of pepper spray, though he did not deploy it. Rosa called the sergeant's behavior “inappropriate and unprofessional” and said he “unnecessarily elevated the demeanor of the suspect."" A concerned officer ran toward the sergeant and pulled him by the back of his duty belt, Rosa said. The video footage shows the sergeant turn around while backpedaling as he was pulled by the officer. He then momentarily places his hand at the throat of the officer and pushes her backward, until her back hits a nearby police vehicle, according to the clip and the statement from the chief. The sergeant then walks away. Rosa said the officer who pulled the sergeant was following the department's policies and procedures that call for intervention when there’s “imminent fear of engagements escalating unnecessarily.” The police chief said he immediately relieved the sergeant of his supervisory responsibilities after hearing about the incident and ordered an internal affairs investigation that is ongoing. The sergeant involved has no contact or supervision over subordinate personnel, Rosa said. “I am very proud of the officer involved in this incident and believe that the actions taken were definitive and demonstrative of good leadership during a tense situation,"" Rosa said. He noted that Sunrise officers are expected to ""de-escalate emotionally charged situations"" and intervene if an officer appears to lose control or display inappropriate conduct in interacting with the public.",U.S./NBC News,Florida police sergeant accused of grabbing officer by her throat,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-police-sergeant-accused-grabbing-191714324.html
1/15/2022,"By Nate Raymond BOSTON (Reuters) -Prosecutors have recommended that the U.S. Justice Department drop charges against a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor accused of concealing his ties to China when seeking federal grant money, a person familiar with the matter said Friday. Federal prosecutors in Boston decided to seek dismissal of the case against Chinese-born mechanical engineer and nanotechnologist Gang Chen. It was the latest setback for a crackdown on Chinese influence within U.S. research. Boston prosecutors recommended the case's dismissal in recent weeks based on new information, the person said, adding the Justice Department has not made a final decision. He was accused of failing to disclose, among other things, that he served as an ""overseas expert"" to the Chinese government and sat on the advisory board of Shenzhen's Southern University of Science and Technology, or SUSTech, when applying for a U.S. Department of Energy grant. But Brian Kelly, a lawyer for Chen at Nixon Peabody, has said last week that ""nothing significant was omitted on his application and several of the government's allegations were simply wrong."" MIT President Rafael Reif has defended https://president.mit.edu/speeches-writing/letter-community-re-sustech-relationship-and-professor-chen its $25 million collaboration SUSTech as furthering MIT's research mission. Faculty in a letter last year https://fnl.mit.edu/january-february-2021/faculty-letter-to-president-reif-in-support-of-professor-gang-chen rallied around Chen, saying the case against him vilified normal research activities. Kelly and co-counsel Rob Fisher had no comment on Friday. MIT declined to comment. Wyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesperson, had no comment on Chen's case. The Wall Street Journal first reported the recommendation. Chen was charged in January 2021 as part of the department's ""China Initiative,"" launched during former President Donald Trump's administration to counter suspected Chinese economic espionage and research theft. Targets included university researchers. A Harvard professor, Charles Lieber, last month was convicted https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/harvard-professor-lied-about-china-ties-us-jury-told-trial-nears-end-2021-12-21 of lying about his ties to a China-run recruitment program. He is expected to appeal. Critics say https://www.reuters.com/world/us/stanford-professors-urge-us-end-program-looking-chinese-spies-academia-2021-09-13 the initiative chilled academic research and targeted Chinese researchers through racial profiling. And despite the Harvard win, several other cases have faltered. A Tennessee professor was acquitted by a judge last year following a mistrial, and prosecutors dropped charges against six other researchers. President Joe Biden's administration has continued the initiative, though Hornbuckle said the Justice Department is reviewing its approach, a review that should be completed in the coming weeks. Rachael Rollins, newly appointed U.S. attorney in Massachusetts, during a meeting with reporters on Thursday would not address whether prosecutors should stop bringing China Initiative cases. But she said ""the government will always look to see whether we can prove our case at various points.""

1/15/2022,"This story was republished on Jan. 14, 2022 to make it free for all readers U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson said this week that mouthwash is one way to protect from COVID-19 but the manufacturer of Listerine and medical experts say studies of the idea haven't yet concluded it's a proven antidote. Johnson in a town hall event on Wednesday said a ""standard gargle"" of mouthwash ""has been proven to kill the coronavirus"" or may reduce viral replication to help protect from a serious surge of COVID-19 cases. ""Why not try all these things?"" he said, including mouthwash in a list of alternatives to COVID-19 vaccines and face masks, like taking supplements of Vitamin D, Vitamin C and Zinc. Subscribe to our On Wisconsin Politics newsletter for the week's political news explained. In a statement to the Journal Sentinel, Johnson said he was not suggesting vitamins or mouthwash was a replacement for COVID-19 vaccines. ""I did not say that taking vitamins, using mouthwash, would be a replacement for the vaccine, should you choose to get one. There are multiple studies that say mouthwash may reduce viral load,"" Johnson said. ""Even Dr. Fauci said, ‘I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, taking vitamin D supplements.’ I continue to be amazed at the resistance to anything that might reduce the severity of COVID-19 symptoms.” Johnson regularly promotes unproven remedies for COVID-19 and expresses doubt in proven ways to combat the pandemic like vaccines. In this case, Listerine mouthwash's effect on disrupting the virus is being studied but its manufacturer and medical experts said the research has not produced the conclusion Johnson suggested to his constituents on Wednesday. More: 'Fundamentally dangerous': Ron Johnson has long history of promoting views at odds with scientific research More: In a long line of medical conspiracy theories, ivermectin is the latest to seduce many, including Aaron Rodgers ""We are aware of several ongoing, independent clinical trials where LISTERINE® is being assessed in patients with COVID-19. However, the current available data is not sufficient to support a conclusion that the use of LISTERINE® mouthwash is helpful against the COVID-19 virus,"" said a statement from Johnson & Johnson shared with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""Our understanding of the course of COVID-19 disease transmission continues to evolve. Overall, more research is needed to understand whether use of mouthwashes can impact viral transmission, exposure, viral entry, viral load and ultimately affect meaningful clinical outcomes or have a public health impact."" Johnson & Johnson officials said it would ""consider further investment in lab and clinical studies with trusted collaborators, playing an important role in understanding the interaction between oral care and the COVID-19 virus in the mouth."" Ben Weston, an associate professor at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Chief Health Policy Adviser for Milwaukee County, said mouthwash kills germs in a person's mouth but ""it does not have the same effect on the rest of your body."" ""The COVID-19 virus enters through the nasal passages and can ravage your lungs, causing difficulty breathing. It can damage your heart causing scarring and decreased cardiac function. It can damage the lining of your blood vessels causing clotting. It can damage your kidneys, leading to long term organ failure. It can damage your reproductive system, leading to poor birth outcomes and erectile dysfunction. The list goes on,"" Weston said. ""We need to focus on prevention that works. The COVID vaccines are safe, they are effective and they are free."" Weston said vaccines make it less likely to get infected in the first place, less likely to transmit the virus to someone else, less likely to experience serious illness after infection, and less likely to get hospitalized or die of the virus.

More: COVID booster shots are now recommended for all American adults: What you should know Ajay Sethi, associate professor of population health sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health, said no one is discouraging the use of the remedies Johnson is proposing but the public should know they are not proven to be effective in protecting against COVID-19 infection. ""Things like home remedies, vitamins and supplements, new diets have been advertised to and used by people in our society for decades, centuries even, for all sorts of ailments. No one is discouraging their use, but they do not provide tangible benefit against Covid, and they are not a substitute for vaccination,"" Sethi said. Ali Mokdad, chief strategy officer of population health at the University of Washington, said Johnson's suggestion to turn to vitamins and mouthwash ""is not appropriate for any virus."" ""Our recommendations are for folks to get vaccinated (3 doses, get a booster as soon as they are eligible), wear a mask (good quality mask and wear it correctly), watch their distance, avoid gathering, and wash hands,"" Mokdad said by email. In his comments on Wednesday, Johnson criticized the National Institutes of Health for focusing on the recommendation to get vaccinated against the virus. Patrick Remington, a former epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and director of the University of Wisconsin-Madison's preventive medicine residency program, said the NIH relies on proven treatments. ""Simply put, the NIH and other researchers set a high bar for proving that a treatment is effective. Studies done in the lab or in animals, or clinical anecdotes play an important part in the research process, and lead to hypotheses that are then tested in rigorous, controlled trials,"" Remington said. ""It would boggle my mind if we skipped this critical step, and instead practiced medicine based only on hunches and best guesses. We need to be patient and let the scientific process play out, and make sure that we first do no harm."" Sethi noted 200 million Americans have chosen to take the advice of the CDC, NIH, and numerous medical and scientific experts to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
