4/2/2022,"Mano had gone to meet her boyfriend at a printing press in Peshawar’s Qissa Khwani bazaar to get back some money he had borrowed. “But he refused to pay,” her friend Farzana Riaz said. “Mano insisted and refused to leave without money. When Mano kept resisting, her boyfriend Sanaullah shot her.” In Pakistan last month news of trans women being murdered in their homes and on the streets made headlines. Five were killed and eight injured in attacks across the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a province bordering Afghanistan. This week a rally and vigil for the community – known as khawaja sira – was held in the capital Islamabad to protest the killings. It was the khawaja sira who took Mano’s body and gave her a funeral after her family refused to. “Mano’s family refused to bury her or accept her, even in her death,” Riaz told the Guardian. “We keep fighting a battle from our births till our deaths. Even after death we are not accepted by our families. What can be a bigger tragedy than this?” Transgender people were legally recognised as “the third gender” through a supreme court ruling in Pakistan in 2012. They were given the right to vote and identify their gender on National Identity Cards. But discrimination is widespread and “honour” killings, rape, blackmail, sexual harassment, attacks, chopping off hair – are common crimes against khawaja sira community. Though no exact figures are available, Riaz, who leads Trans-Action Alliance, said: “Since 2015, 91 transgender women were killed in the province and we have 2,000 registered cases of violence on the transgender community just in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.” The violence is widespread across the country. Last December in Pakistan’s metropolitan city Karachi, a transgender woman was murdered in her home and a trans activist, an organiser of the People’s Climate March, was abducted and raped. Gudiya, 23, who came to the vigil to protest against the rise in violence said the community is excluded from education and therefore has few options for work other than begging, dancing and sex work. “If we had opportunities and alternatives, we would not have opted [for] these options,” said Gudiya, “and the irony is that these very reasons are then used to humiliate and murder us.” Nayyab Ali, the executive director of Transgender Rights Consultants in Pakistan, says transphobia and hate crime are clear reasons behind the recent surge of violence against the community. Ali said: “Threats, bullying, intimidation and harassment– are part of our daily lives and they eventually turn to hate crimes like murder of transgender people. These incidents are not reported, nor do our police take them seriously if they are reported.” Trans people who report crimes are not taken seriously, she says. “Police does not play its due role and we have not seen any killers get arrested and executed.” The khawaja sira is a vulnerable community in Pakistan, and “honour” killing of the community is rampant. “If a trans woman leaves her boyfriend, she is killed. If nude videos of a trans are sent to her homes, she would be killed and at times, khawaja sira are killed just dancing at parties,” said Ali. “We don’t get justice.” In 2018 Pakistan passed legislation guaranteeing basic rights for transgender citizens and outlawing discrimination. Many Pakistanis are keen to support the minority. Attending Thursday’s rally in Islamabad, Prof Farzana Bari, said she wanted to show solidarity with the khwaja sira community. “The community is organised now and a leadership is emerging and they raise [their] voice for their community’s rights and against violence. But we, women and men, have to stand by them as allies.”",News/Global development,Pakistan’s transgender women protest against rising tide of violence,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/01/pakistan-transgender-women-protest-against-rising-tide-of-violence
4/2/2022,"Police have begun to issue a “first tranche” of 20 fines to people they believe took part in lockdown parties in Downing Street. There were 12 parties, leaving dos, “wine Fridays” and work meetings referred by Sue Gray, the civil service investigator, to the Metropolitan police. However, the police are not revealing which parties have resulted in fines. Here is a full rundown of the parties under investigation, and the broad details of all the claims we know about. 1) 20 May 2020: ‘BYOB’ in No 10 garden One of the more explosive revelations, after the publication of a leaked email to No 10 staff inviting them, during the first lockdown, to “make the most of the lovely weather” and attend drinks in the garden, adding “BYOB” – “bring your own booze”. The email was sent by Johnson’s principal private secretary, the senior civil servant Martin Reynolds. The PM and Carrie Symonds, then his fiancée, attended for a time. Johnson apologised but insisted he only realised in retrospect it might have been a social gathering. 2) 18 June 2020: Cabinet Office gathering for departure of official This is a claim that had not previously seen the light of day before Gray’s report, which describes it only as “a gathering in the Cabinet Office, 70 Whitehall, on the departure of a No 10 private secretary”. No indication whether Johnson was present. 3) 19 June 2020: PM’s surprise birthday Downing Street has accepted that about 30 people, among them the interior designer Lulu Lytle, who is not a member of staff but was renovating Johnson’s flat, gathered to mark Johnson’s birthday in the cabinet room. No 10 say Johnson was there for less than 10 minutes. There was, reportedly, a birthday cake, singing, and picnic food from Marks & Spencer. The Northern Ireland minister, Conor Burns, later memorably defended Johnson, saying the PM had been “ambushed with a cake”. 4) 13 November 2020: No 10 leaving event On the day that Johnson’s former chief aide Dominic Cummings was removed, there is a mention in Gray’s report of “a gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a special adviser”. As Cummings left abruptly, this seems likely to refer to the departure on the same day of Lee Cain, Johnson’s then head of communications. It is not clear whether Johnson attended. 5) 13 November 2020: gathering in Johnson’s flat Sources have reported that on the day Cummings departed, loud music and other party noises came from the No 11 flat occupied by Johnson and his wife Carrie, a known foe of Cummings. Downing Street has denied any rule-breaking, and it is not clear who was there. 6) 17 December 2020: the Christmas quiz An alleged social event took place in the office of the cabinet secretary, Simon Case – who was initially meant to have led the Gray report but stepped down after the claim about his own office. The invitation billed it as a “Christmas party”, but government insiders said it was a virtual quiz and Case only passed through the event on the way to his office. Johnson did not attend. 7) 17 December 2020: Cabinet Office leaving event for senior official Kate Josephs, the former Covid taskforce head, has apologised for attending a drinks gathering to mark her leaving the civil service on the same day. She is now chief executive of Sheffield city council, where her future is uncertain. 8) 17 December 2020: No 10 leaving event Another previously unknown gathering mentioned in the report. It says only: “A gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of a No 10 official.” It is not clear who that was, or who attended. 9) 18 December 2020: No 10 Christmas party According to witnesses, dozens of staff gathered for a Christmas party, with cheese and wine passed around, a mock awards ceremony and secret Santa gifts exchanged. This event propelled coverage of the parties after a video emerged of Allegra Stratton, the prime minister’s then press secretary, joking about it a few days later. 10) 14 January 2021: No 10 leaving event for officials Another claim that emerged for the first time in Gray’s report. It is described thus: “A gathering in No 10 Downing Street on the departure of two No 10 private secretaries.” It is not confirmed who they were, or who attended. 11) 16 April 2021: Downing Street garden/first leaving party One of the most damaging claims – that on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral, where the Queen sat alone, two leaving events were held in No 10. The first, and seemingly less rowdy, was for James Slack, who was the prime minister’s official spokesperson under both Theresa May and Johnson, before becoming Johnson’s director of communications. Johnson was at Chequers that evening. 12) 16 April 2021: Downing Street garden/second leaving party The second of the events, for a government photographer, reportedly began in the basement, with music played by an official. It is believed this is the event for which an official bought a suitcase full of wine from a nearby supermarket. The two events later combined in the garden, where one reveller sat on and broke the swing of Johnson’s infant son, Wilfred. 13) 15 May 2020: gathering in No 10 garden This was the event captured in a now famous photo shown to the Guardian, portraying a series of groups on the No 10 terrace and lawn, among them Johnsons, Cummings and Reynolds, sitting at a table with wine and a cheese board. The Gray report refers only to “a photograph showing a number of groups in the garden of No 10 Downing Street”, perhaps indicating that she did not hear from witnesses about it. Johnson insisted he believed it was a work event. 14) 27 November 2020: No 10 leaving do For No 10 aide Cleo Watson. Johnson is known to have attended the event, remarking on how crowded the room was, before making a short speech and leaving. 15) 10 December 2020: Department for Education Christmas event Gavin Williamson, the then education secretary, held drinks in his department for staff. The department’s most senior civil servant, Susan Acland-Hood, said she attended the “work-related” gathering in which people congregated in the canteen for Williamson to “say a few words”. 16) 15 December 2020: No 10 Christmas quiz Johnson hosted the Christmas quiz in Downing Street, and was pictured on a screen reading out questions flanked by staff who wore tinsel and a Santa hat. Some staff joined virtually, but sources said others crowded around desks. 17) 25 November 2020: Treasury ‘impromptu drinks’ The Treasury defended officials holding an “impromptu” drinks party to celebrate Rishi Sunak’s autumn spending review during lockdown. A spokesperson said a “small number” of staff had celebrated around their desks. 18) Before Christmas 2020: leaving event for defence adviser The Mirror alleged that the PM gave a speech at a leaving event for his then defence adviser, Capt Steve Higham, in the run-up to Christmas. 19) 14 December 2020: CCHQ Christmas party for Shaun Bailey A picture showed that an event hosted by the campaign for the Conservatives’ London mayoral candidate, Shaun Bailey, was held in Tory campaign headquarters, with buffet food. Police have looked into the gathering. 20) 16 December 2020: Department for Transport gathering The Mirror said staff of the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, threw a Christmas party at which almost a dozen staff were “boozing and dancing” in a Whitehall office.",News/Politics,Lockdown parties and events: 20 gatherings we know about so far,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/31/lockdown-parties-and-events-20-gatherings-we-know-about-so-far
4/2/2022,"Sophie Ecclestone has attributed England’s dramatic comeback in the World Cup to the leadership of their captain, Heather Knight, and called on her team to “do it for Heather” when they face Australia in the World Cup final at Christchurch on Sunday. Knight was at the helm five years ago when England won the trophy in dramatic fashion at Lord’s, and more recently has marshalled an incredible turnaround, with her team victorious in five must-win matches on the trot after three initial losses put them on the verge of elimination. At the age of 31, it’s possible that Sunday’s match may be her last chance to lead her side out in a 50-over World Cup final. “To come back the way we have, Heather’s very proud of this group and what we’ve achieved,” Ecclestone said. “As a team, we get on so well. We want the best for each other. So when we go out and play cricket, we do it for each other. “When we lost three from three, there were a few tears in the changing room. The turning point was a few meetings just to say, we’ve got nothing to lose now, let’s put everything we’re doing at the training ground into a game and go out with no fear, which I think we have done. Hopefully we can go out there on Sunday and do it for Heather.” Alongside England’s rollercoaster journey, the 22-year-old Ecclestone has experienced something of a personal resurgence during the tournament. The left-arm spinner went wicketless in their opening match against Australia four weeks ago, conceding 77 runs – her worst-ever figures in ODI cricket. But in the weeks since, she has clambered her way to the top of the tournament wicket-taking charts, with 20 scalps in the bag. The recently issued ICC bowling rankings revealed that she has risen to the No 1 spot in ODIs for the first time, a distinction that sits alongside her existing crown as the world No 1 T20 bowler. Her return of six for 36 in Thursday’s semi-final against South Africa saw her break the record for most wickets taken by an Englishwoman at a World Cup, overcoming the previous best by Laura Marsh in the 2009 tournament. “I didn’t have a great day out against the Aussies. To come back the way I did, I’m really proud of myself,” she said. “It’s something I’ve been working hard for, I’ve been trying to get a five-for for a while now. It’s a very proud moment for me and my family.” Adding to her tally during Sunday’s match would be the icing on the cake for a player who was omitted from England’s 2017 World Cup-winning squad, with the then head coach, Mark Robinson, feeling she should focus on her A level exams. Instead, she had to watch their triumph at Lord’s from the stands along with 24,000 other fans. “It’s massive for me personally,” she said of this year’s final. “I’ve not won a major trophy yet since I started playing for England, and I’d really love to win one sooner rather than later.” Amazingly, given the dominance of the two sides in international women’s cricket in recent years (no other team has won a 50-over title since 2000), Sunday will be the first time England have faced Australia in a World Cup final since December 1988. On that occasion, at the MCG, Australia smashed England by eight wickets, chasing down their 128-run target with ease. One contemporary account described the Australians as “more athletic and agile in the field, considerably sharper between the wickets… [they] honed batting and bowling skills to a consistently higher level than the majority of opponents”. Much may have changed in women’s cricket since then, but it is a description which could just as easily apply to Meg Lanning’s 2022 team as it did Sharon Tredrea’s in 1988. Australia’s path to the final could not have been more different from England’s. Lanning and co have gone unbeaten across the tournament, doing nothing to dispel their pre-tournament “favourites by a country mile” tag; there is a notion in many quarters that the outcome of Sunday’s final is a foregone conclusion before the coin is even tossed. Ecclestone, naturally, disagrees: “On our day we can definitely beat the Aussies, and I think we’ve got a great chance to,” she said. England surrendered the Ashes 12-4 on points back in February, but the feeling in the England camp is that their opening World Cup encounter against Australia was a fairer reflection of the way the two sides match up. On that occasion England came within 12 runs of Australia’s mammoth 310-run total, thanks to an unbeaten century from Nat Sciver. Sciver has since had an inconsistent tournament with the bat, but could look to memories of the 2017 final to buoy her ahead of Sunday’s match: her half-century in a low-scoring game at Lord’s was crucial in their 9-run win against India. Australia, meanwhile, have a chance to seal their reputation as one of the all-time great teams by winning the one piece of silverware that has eluded them of late (they last won the tournament in 2013). When her side were knocked out in the 2017 semi-final courtesy of a Harmanpreet Kaur special, Lanning shed tears in the post-match press conference, in an unusual public display of emotion; a win in Sunday’s match would be the ultimate way to heal those scars.",Sport/Sport,Sophie Ecclestone calls on England to ‘do it for Heather’ in World Cup final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/01/sophie-ecclestone-calls-on-england-to-do-it-for-heather-in-world-cup-final

However, one particularly tricky question The Fiver can’t help but feel has gone unasked regards the timing of Friday’s draw. Scheduled for 5pm BST, it hasn’t gone unnoticed here in Fiver Towers that world football’s governing body has pointedly timed it to coincide with the arrival of the world’s most daily email in the spam folders of our subscribers, meaning we’re unable to provide any pithy commentary here. What’s more, this deliberate act of spiteful, bureaucratic sabotage means that, in terms of piping-hot takes on high-profile match-ups, it behoves us to scrabble around closer to home. Following a two-week hiatus the Premier League resumes on Saturday, with Liverpool’s game against Watford getting proceedings under way at Anfield. Victory for Jürgen Klopp’s side would see them leapfrog Manchester City and go top of the table for a couple of hours at least, until Pep Guardiola and his merry men swat Burnley aside at Turf Moor. Not that the German is taking his side’s inevitable win for granted against a side battling for Premier League survival. “If we viewed this as an easy game we wouldn’t have that many points,” he cooed, before spoiling the surprise he has in store for Mr Roy’s team and insulting a town 40 miles away. “We have to surprise Watford with our intensity – it’s not an easy weekend for City or us. Burnley is the last place you want to go.” For a man who has complained loudly and at great length since his arrival in England any time his team has been forced to play early on a Saturday, Klopp was uncharacteristically upbeat about their kick-off time. “Most of the time City have played before us,” he blurted. “This time we play before them but I couldn’t care less.” However, he did warn any Liverpool fans with laryngitis to stay away from Anfield. “We need the best 12.30pm atmosphere ever – if you cannot shout or sing, then stay at home and give your ticket to somebody else, please.” That’s them told. Join John Brewin now for updates from the draw for the Human Rights World Cup. “My family told me to go to western Ukraine but I refused. I said: ‘I am from Kyiv, I can’t leave’.

Maguire’s time at Leicester City coincided with the Foxes losing four consecutive games to Palace for the first time since the 1990s, but the Eagles have not beaten them since Maguire moved to Manchester United.

4/2/2022,"The organizers of the Razzies parody awards show have rescinded Bruce Willis’s 2021 award in light of the actor’s recently disclosed aphasia diagnosis. The annual awards, which recognize the worst films and performances, gave Willis his own special category this year: “Worst performance by Bruce Willis in a 2021 movie”. Willis was also nominated eight times, winning for his lead performance in the sci-fi film Cosmic Sin. Days after the ceremony, however, Willis’s family announced that the actor was retiring after being diagnosed with aphasia, a disorder that affects the ability to understand language and communicate. On Thursday the Razzies decided to revoke Willis’s award, saying it was no longer appropriate. “After much thought and consideration, the Razzies have made the decision to rescind the Razzie Award given to Bruce Willis, due to his recently disclosed diagnosis,” said Razzies co-founders John Wilson and Maureen Murphy in a statement. They noted that the special category created for Willis “will not be repeated”, as it was never meant to continue. On Wednesday, several of Willis’s family members posted a joint statement to social media about the actor’s health problems and subsequent diagnosis. “This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support,” it said. But at first the Razzies seemed to joke about the actor’s announcement, as first reported in the Washington Post. “The Razzies are truly sorry for #BruceWillis diagnosed condition,” tweeted the official Razzie Awards account. “Perhaps this explains why he wanted to go out with a bang in 2021. Our best wishes to Bruce and family.” The Razzies are truly sorry for #BruceWillis diagnosed condition. Perhaps this explains why he wanted to go out with a bang in 2021. Our best wishes to Bruce and family. As the tweet attracted criticism and questions about whether the Razzies would revoke Willis’s awards, Wilson and Murphy seemed resistant to the idea. “Whoever handles Willis’ affairs should probably not have permitted him to do such a high volume of work in such a short time, especially if they were aware of his situation,” said the co-founders to the Wrap. “In Willis’ defense, his reps should have kept a better eye on his legacy.” The next day, they publicly announced they would revoke Willis’s awards. As of publication time on Friday, the 2021 award and eight nominations were still listed on the Razzies website.",Arts/Film,Bruce Willis’s ‘worst performance’ award from Razzies show revoked after diagnosis,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/01/bruce-willis-worst-performance-award-razzies-revoked-diagnosis
4/2/2022,"Fashion has decided that it is time to raise the barre and to embrace the ballet look. This week British Vogue unveiled its April cover, featuring Anya Taylor-Joy of The Queen’s Gambit. Featuring tulle dresses and mesh body stockings from Dior, taffeta corsets from Jean Paul Gaultier and a chantilly lace corset dress by Alexis Mabille, the photoshoot was a love letter to the world of leg warmers and hair buns. At the Oscars, both Zoë Kravitz and Lily James wore dresses in “ballet pink”; later in the week Sarah Jessica Parker recalled Carrie Bradshaw’s pink tutu in a Prabal Gurung maxi dress and Harry Styles revealed his ballet pumps on the cover of his upcoming album, Harry’s House. Beyoncé, Dua Lipa and Billie Eilish have made the balletic catsuit by Thierry Mugler pop’s go-to uniform while the blue wrap cardigan worn by Sydney Sweeney’s character Cassie Howard in HBO’s Euphoria recently went viral. “[The look] channels the dressing room, the rehearsal space and the dance studio, where clothing must be comfortable and versatile, easy to pull on and off, with little superfluous decoration,” says Prof Alison L Goodrum, a fashion theorist and dress historian who is director of research development at Norwich University of the Arts. The style has gained traction among the public, with the fashion search engine Lyst reporting a 36% increase in searches for ballet flats and a 22% increase in searches for tulle dresses in the last six months, and on social media (#Balletcore currently has 7.5m views on TikTok). Meanwhile, fashion brands like Simone Roche, Molly Goddard, Gucci, Erdem, Miu Miu and The Vampire’s Wife have been hugely influenced by the fluid style of the dance style too. It can be seen too as a reaction to the pandemic and after a spell of wearing tracksuit bottoms. “It suggests a more general rediscovery of the body after a significant period of time buried under baggy, shapeless, non-clothing during lockdown,” says Goodrum. “The look is about emphasising the natural contours of the body.” Prof Angela McRobbie, a cultural theorist at Goldsmiths, University of London, says: “The ballet studio remains such a place of popular fantasy for girls. So there is some sort of big nostalgia for ‘girlhood’ underpinning the current romance with ballet.” Balletcore is about fantasy and romance but the trend is also potentially problematic. “There is now a big debate on Twitter about black ballet and the importance of challenging its prior existence as dominant whiteness,” says McRobbie. While the promotion of super-slim bodies is questionable in an era of plus size advocacy. “Some may argue the look sanctions and endorses an overemphasis on the body and the strict disciplining of it in the pursuit of dancerly perfection,” adds Goodrum.",Lifestyle/Fashion,On pointe: fashion leaps for ballet look after bagginess of lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/apr/01/fashion-leaps-for-ballet-look-tulle-taffeta-pumps-studio
4/2/2022,"Last night, No 10 backed down on its plans to scrap its long-promised ban on “conversion practice” for lesbian, gay and bisexual people, but crucially it has chosen to leave trans people unprotected. As someone who underwent nearly 20 years of conversion practices, which resulted in me being hospitalised twice, I find this utterly unforgivable. Conversion practice is any intervention that seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation or gender identity. These interventions can involve pseudo-scientific counselling sessions, being prayed over, exorcisms and even corrective rape. I put myself through years of “healing prayer” ministry, sharing some of my most intimate moments and relationships with strangers in the hope that we might “find the key” as to why I was attracted to women. I even took part in exorcisms, paying thousands of pounds in the process. I was constantly told that my prayers were unanswered because of my lack of faith, or because I wasn’t holy enough. Part of the trauma of these abusive practices is that you, the victim, are always left with the burden of being told it is your fault, that you are not healed. It nearly broke me, but I survived. Sadly, many others are not so lucky. In 2018, the then prime minister Theresa May promised to ban the practice, but her successor, Boris Johnson, stalled on the plans, despite promises to enact them. That is why I resigned from the government’s LGBT advisory panel in March last year, which then elicited a promise in the Queen’s speech that the government would finally ban these abhorrent practices. Then came the leaked report yesterday evening, which I was shown by ITV, saying that the ban was to be scrapped. I and others were furious. There was a media maelstrom which in turn led to yet another U-turn by the prime minister. I fear that few in the LGBT+ community will ever trust the prime minister again, and most will see this U-turn as proof that this administration is creating a “hostile environment” for LGBT+ people, especially trans people. One has to wonder who is advising the prime minister, given that he was prepared to go against the advice of three highly eminent UN independent experts, the entire British medical profession and the Church of England when he decided to renege on his promise to protect vulnerable LGBT+ people. The sad truth is that he has only backed down because of a major revolt in his own party and the backlash from campaigners like myself, which has left him with a public relations disaster. Notably, he has made no apology for his actions, and has continued to show that he does not have any understanding of the harm that trans people will continue to endure. My advice to him would be to sit down and meet with survivors as a matter of urgency. Trans people are the most likely to be offered and put through “conversion practices”. In the government’s 2018 LGBT survey, trans people were shown to be nearly twice as likely as lesbian and gay people to be offered and to undergo these interventions. It is deeply ironic that on the one day that the international community seeks to support and celebrate trans people, Trans Visibility Day, the prime minister decided instead to exclude them from the urgent protections they need. The damage is clear. My own foundation ran some research with Stonewall and Mermaids among the trans community in 2020, which showed the full extent of the horror that so many trans people faced – beatings, deprivation, verbal abuse, prayer, exorcism. They were left totally undefended at a critical stage in their lives, with no one to turn to for help. As recent research by Galop has pointed out, a third of LGBT+ people experience abuse by relatives – which is why they need protection from the state. Sadly it seems that some anti-trans groups have spread false narratives and stoked irrational fears, with quite devastating results. The truth, as always, has been the casualty. Despite their faux concern, there is no risk at all that the medical profession will be prevented from working with their trans clients by any legislation that seeks to eradicate conversion practice. Instead, safe spaces where people can explore and reach a sense of peace about who they are will be welcomed and encouraged – be that in the home, in the therapist’s chair or in a religious setting. Gender-affirming therapy and gender transition healthcare are not conversion practices. However, what will be banned is telling someone that they have to be straight or cis-gendered, and that anything else is unacceptable. This is what the Ban Conversion Therapy Legal Forum, chaired by Lady Helena Kennedy QC, has called a “predetermined purpose” – any practice that has only one outcome. It is these practices, often fuelled by a religious belief, that must be outlawed and their perpetrators brought to account. This is why we need the prime minister to act – and act fast – to ban conversion practice for trans people in addition to lesbians, gays and bisexuals, as other countries have done. Delay only serves to embolden perpetrators, who are currently acting with impunity. It’s about time Boris Johnson apologised and committed to doing the right thing. Whether he likes it or not, the shadow of section 28 looms large – and this debacle has set the Tory party back two decades.

4/2/2022,"A convoy of aid trucks has arrived in Tigray, the first emergency food supplies to reach the besieged region of northern Ethiopia by road for more than 100 days. Two weeks after Abiy Ahmed’s government declared an immediate “humanitarian truce” with rebel Tigrayan forces to allow aid in, the World Food Programme said it had received the assurances it needed to dispatch 20 trucks containing vital supplies of food. Since mid-December no aid has reached Tigray on the land route from Semera, in neighbouring Afar, to Mekelle, the capital of Tigray. In a video posted online earlier on Friday, WFP said the convoy contained 500 metric tons of food and nutrition supplies “for communities on the edge of starvation”. A fuel tanker followed behind but had not yet entered Tigray, a spokesperson added.

The authorities in Addis, meanwhile, have accused the TPLF of bringing misery upon their own people by conducting military offensives on key aid delivery routes. Thousands have died and many more been forced to flee their homes in the 16-month war and, as it drags on, the civilian population remaining in Tigray is considered desperately in need of food, fuel and medical supplies. According to an assessment in January, at least 2 million people are suffering from an extreme lack of food. Since January some medical and nutrition supplies have been trickling in by air, but the UN says they are a fraction of what is needed. On a series of flights since 24 January, roughly 360 metric tons of supplies have been delivered – about nine trucks’ worth, according to the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs. In a move that took many by surprise, Abiy’s government declared a truce on 24 March, saying it hoped the move would ease humanitarian access to Tigray and “pave the way for the resolution of the conflict”. It called on the TPLF to “desist from all acts of further aggression and withdraw from areas they have occupied in neighbouring regions”. The rebels in turn urged “Ethiopian authorities to go beyond empty promises and take concrete steps to facilitate unfettered humanitarian access to Tigray”.",News/Global development,First food aid for 100 days enters Tigray under ‘humanitarian truce’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/01/first-food-aid-for-100-days-enters-tigray-under-humanitarian-truce
4/2/2022,"The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, has afforded Russia’s foreign minister the honour of a meeting as Sergei Lavrov praised India’s refusal to condemn the Ukraine invasion. Lavrov, who is visiting the country, predicted Moscow and Delhi would find ways to circumvent “illegal” western sanctions and continue to trade. Modi had not met the string of other foreign ministers to arrive in Delhi in recent days, including the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, so Lavrov looks to have been singled out for attention by the Indian leader. India has abstained from successive United Nations resolutions censuring Moscow, calling only for an end to violence, and has increased its oil purchases from Russia, its biggest supplier of arms. Truss, in India on Thursday, had tried to cast the battle as one between democracies and autocracies, but India, the world’s most populous democracy, does not seem willing to accept this, especially if it requires India to break with Russia on issues such as arms sales and a future realignment of the global security architecture in which the US has a less prominent role. Lavrov said: “These days our western colleagues would like to reduce any meaningful international issue to the crisis in Ukraine … [We] appreciate that India is taking this situation in the entirety of facts, not just in a one-sided way. I can only say that the balanced position of India which is not influenced by blackmail or diktat methods inspires our respect.” Lavrov also claimed Ukraine was showing increasing understanding that joining Nato was not an option. “Friendship is the key word to describe the history of our relations, and our relations were very sustainable during many difficult times in the past,” he said. His Indian counterpart, Dr S Jaishankar, reiterated “the importance of cessation of violence and ending hostilities” and said: “Disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy.” Lavrov said Russia’s military offensive in Ukraine was not “just about Ukraine, its neutrality”, but rather a “question of world order”. He suggested that the US had now suppressed all attempts at establishing autonomy by Europe, with the latter now completely in lockstep with Washington, a status to which he said Europe was reconciled. In words designed to attract approval in India, he said the west’s real endgame was the re-establishment of a unipolar world. Lavrov said the US and its allies were trying to conceal their true objectives, portraying their confrontation with Russia and some other nations as a “battle between democracies and autocracies”. However, according to the Russian foreign minister, the west itself has become one big autocracy with the US at the helm. But there are also tensions in the relationship between India and Russia. Western financial sanctions have reportedly made it difficult for India to pay Russia for imports including arms, oil, rough diamonds and fertilisers. Russia has written to India’s defence ministry requesting clearance of back payments worth $1.3bn, according to the Economic Times newspaper. India and Russia have been working on a rupee-rouble mechanism to facilitate trade and get around western sanctions on Russian banks, according to media reports. Lavrov told reporters he was confident the two countries would find a solution. “Many years ago we started moving in our relations with India, with China, with many other countries from using dollars and euros to more and more use of national currencies. Under these circumstances this trend I believe will be intensified,” he said. “We will be ready to supply to India any goods which India wants to buy … and I have no doubt that a way will be found to bypass the artificial impediments which illegal unilateral sanctions by the west create.” Lavrov arrived in Delhi on Thursday from China, where he had hailed Beijing as part of a new “multipolar, just, democratic world order”. India shares western alarm over China’s growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region, and is a member of the so-called Quad alliance with the US, Japan and Australia. The US is pushing the argument that Russia will end up the junior partner in its relationship with China and that the more leverage China gains over Russia, the less favourable that is for India.",News/World news,"Russia and India will find ways to trade despite sanctions, says Lavrov",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/russia-and-india-will-find-ways-to-trade-despite-sanctions-says-lavrov
4/2/2022,"Iam clinging to a rope ladder, 20 metres above the ground, in a howling gale. “Now imagine you’ve got no shoes on, never mind a harness and a helmet – and the ship is pitching and rolling,” shouts my instructor. Wow. It’s a miracle that any 19th-century sailor made it home alive. (Many didn’t.) The Cutty Sark, one of the world’s last surviving tea clippers, is launching a new rig climb experience on Saturday, and I was having a sneak preview. Royal Museums Greenwich has teamed up with Wire & Sky, the adventure company behind the O2 rooftop climb and the London Abseil. Its mission is to give visitors a taste of life at sea and a unique view of London – and no doubt to help recoup the losses incurred during the pandemic. After getting kitted up under the hull, which is almost entirely original and dates back to 1869, we were led through the ship and up on to the main deck. We were regaled with tales from the ship’s heyday, including the legendary race against a rival clipper, Thermopylae, in 1872, when Captain George Moodie refused to stop for repairs even when the rudder was lost. History lesson over, it was time to climb. I tried to imagine the poor 14-year-old apprentices being ordered to shin up the ratlines in all weathers – there is a reason most of the 653 men who served on the Cutty Sark did so only once. Even with modern safety equipment, it was a nerve-jangling climb up the rigging to the top platform, 21 metres up. The minimum height requirement is 3ft 9in (1.14 metres), but even at a comparatively lofty 5ft 2in (1.57 metres), I struggled to reach some of the rungs with my feet. The standard climb ends here, but I had inadvertently signed up for the “rig climb plus”. My harness was unclipped at the front and reattached at the back (crew take care of all the safety aspects), allowing me more freedom of movement. I steeled myself and climbed even higher, gripping the shrouds as I was buffeted by the wind. Then, leaving the relative comfort of the main rigging, I inched my way sideways across the lower topsail yard, with just one rope to stand on and one to grasp on to for dear life. This was daunting, but worth it for the crow’s nest view: the Royal Naval College to starboard, the Thames and Canary Wharf to for’ard and the skyline of central London off to port side. To descend, I shinned back down the ratlines to the tops platform, where there is a zipline to street level. You simply sit into your harness and step off – again, not an action for the faint-hearted. The zipline itself is a slow, smooth, controlled descent rather than a heart-pumping freefall; a final chance to soak up the view. Those expecting to climb right to the top of the mainmast, 46.6 metres up, might be disappointed – the highest point of the climb is about half that. But all apart from the most hardened adrenaline junkies will get a thrill; I found it much more challenging than similar attractions such as the O2 climb. Plus, it’s a privilege to get so close to a historic London landmark. Just cross your fingers for calm weather – and be grateful that you’re not in bare feet.

4/2/2022,"These two West Midlands powerhouses are back in the top half of the top flight, with only one place separating them in eighth and ninth. Bruno Lage’s side will not be looking over their shoulders anytime soon, though, as they have a whopping 10-point advantage. Villa are starting to kick on with Steven Gerrard and their recent glamour signings, although they suffered hard-fought losses to West Ham and Arsenal before the international break. Wolves were 3-2 victors at Villa Park in October, a late turnaround that sparked a losing run and Gerrard taking the wheel from Dean Smith. Wolves are another hard-nosed unit but struggle to score without Raúl Jiménez in the lineup. With the striker suspended, Villa have a cracking opportunity to earn some payback.
