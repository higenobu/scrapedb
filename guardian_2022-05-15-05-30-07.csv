5/15/2022,"In the last few weeks Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison have excelled in blandness. They have been locked into a soulless game in which the person who says the least, in the vaguest terms possible, wins. Watching the two men on the campaign trail, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this whole contest is simply a personality competition. But of course, as everyone keeps telling us, the real story of the 2022 election isn’t about the blokes in suits, it’s about a wave of women in teal who have no qualms about saying what they stand for. This is partially true, of course, but I keep waiting for someone to point out the blindingly obvious. As important as they are as a phenomenon, the independents replicate parliament’s current racial and ethnic diversity problem. If the legislature has begun to see a gender reckoning, it is clear it is still not ready for what a racial reckoning might look like. The independents’ campaigns have been highly focussed on climate change and integrity, but there is no question that they have also been fuelled by women’s collective anger about the unbearable sexism in Australian politics. A number of the candidates – including Jo Dyer who is running in Boothby, Zoe Daniel in Goldstein and Monique Ryan in Kooyong – have been explicit about this. So, while the platform they are running on is about climate change, and many of them are backed by the Climate 200 movement, the teal candidates are most certainly responding to the deep-seated misogyny that caused an upswell of anger amongst women across the nation which culminated in the Jenkins Review. Should enough of the teal candidates win, their rise will be heralded as an insurgency. It may be more appropriate to refer to any success they enjoy as a palace coup. Despite the seemingly radical impetus that has inspired many of them to enter politics, as Wentworth candidate Allegra Spender has noted, “I am not a radical at all. But there are those who are trying to paint me, and this wave of independents, as such.” The teal candidates are fighting against a party that served their grandfathers well, but no longer works for them. In the process, they are up against men who belong to their social class. Teal candidates are contesting the Liberal party in six of the 10 richest electorates in the country. This includes Wentworth, where average net worth per capita is over a million dollars , and Warringah, where that figure stands at $900,000. An independent is running for the seat of Kooyong, where the average net worth per capita is $775 000, and in my electorate of Curtin, in WA, an independent is running to represent an area where the average net worth per capita is $818, 000. This raises real questions about how progressive they will be overall. Still, given the terrifying recklessness of the Coalition’s climate stance in the last decade, the independents – even if they are as moderate as they claim to be – will push parliament in the right direction. What is patently clear at this stage is that the elite status of the women at the frontlines of this pushback against the Morrison government is a considerable strength, even as it has potential drawbacks. Who better to unseat the elite, than elite women with strong networks and access to people with deep pockets? The teals are hitting the Liberal party where it hurts, and it is clear that Morrison is running scared. He has gone so far as to suggest that the teals will herald an era of “chaos and instability” in Australian politics. The idea is inherently sexist of course, buying into old tropes about women as irrational and emotionally unstable. The Labor party has a better record on gender than the Coalition. Still, the party’s track record of parachuting wealthy white candidates into safe seats – even when people of colour with strong community ties, excellent credentials and bright ideas are available – is dismal. For all my excitement about the changes that could sweep through politics, both in terms of institutional culture and climate change if enough teal candidates win, I find myself disheartened by the fact that the independents backed by Climate 200 are virtually all white. To be sure, the decision to run for office requires deep pockets and solid networks. Still, the support of backers like Climate 200 indicates that someone is thinking strategically about who gets supported and who doesn’t. In this country there is always a trade-off between women and racial minorities; as though it’s a zero-sum game. The lack of racial and ethnic diversity on the Climate 200 list is disappointing, not only because of fairness but because of what it means for the work of climate advocacy. No one can seriously think that the only people who care about climate change are white, so how can it be that the list of candidates has very little to no multicultural representation? The Climate 200 movement is in its early stages, and it still has time to course correct. As it becomes more institutionalised and perhaps more successful, it must avoid mirroring the overwhelming whiteness of the political system. Those who support it must know that there can be no climate justice, no genuine movement to reach net zero or to address the burning forests and the boiling seas, without First Nations leadership. And without the participation of migrant communities whose places of origin are so profoundly affected, it is impossible to imagine a robust, vibrant and impactful climate movement.

5/15/2022,"Last Wednesday, St Vincent de Paul opened a new kitchen in the inner Melbourne suburb of Kensington. Fitted inside two portable shipping containers, the commercial oven and cool room will be the new hub for the long-running charity’s soup van operation, which hands out hot meals to people in need. “Part of the reason we needed to build the new facility was we had grown so much over Covid,” says Melissa Walton, Vinnies Victoria’s soup van manager. “Even now you’re seeing more and more people coming through. There are a lot of first time callers through the welfare assistance line too, and they’re calling and requesting food.” Prior to the pandemic, there were two Vinnies soup vans that handed out about 12,000 meals in the inner city. Then Covid hit and demand exploded: in the 2020-21 financial year, Vinnies soup vans handed out 373,000 meals, and now run nine separate vans. Walton has been running the soup van operation since Covid hit. She says the withdrawal of pandemic supports and the rising cost of living has created a perfect storm for people on shoestring budgets. “This end of it – jobseeker has gone back to what it was before Covid, but everything else has gone up in the meantime. People just can’t afford to buy what they used to buy.” Vinnies is just one emergency relief outlet reporting an increase in requests for assistance with the basics. A Guardian Australia analysis from November last year, collating a decade’s worth of data from the three major food relief providers nationally – Foodbank, OzHarvest and SecondBite – showed that demand for food relief was rising before Covid, even before the black summer bushfires that preceded it. In the six months since, those organisations say that with inflation at record levels and the cost of living outstripping wage rises, demand has not slowed down. “The charities we support can always take more food to meet their community needs and we still have many charities on the waiting list,” says Ronni Kahn, founder and chief executive at OzHarvest. “In the last three months, AskIzzy searches went up 22% – this is a function on our website which allows people to search for local food relief. This is up 62% from pre-Covid times. The average is over 53,000 searches a month.” Kahn says charities that OzHarvest works with are reporting that new cohorts are needing help – people who’ve never needed food relief before. In Victoria, Secondbite’s international student support program at Melbourne University has doubled its weekly volume of food relief in the last six months and is about to open a new site. Sites at other tertiary institutions around the state have also relaunched their meals programs due to increased demand. In New South Wales, requests for food assistance from agencies have been coming in weekly, rather than fortnightly. Steve Clifford, Secondbite’s chief executive, says a pensioner who went to a relief centre in Western Australia described having to reduce the amount of minced meat she bought each week, and portion that reduced ration into smaller and smaller segments to make it last. “This is just one example of many where someone is able to buy less food each week, because their fixed income goes less distance, because the cost of food is increasing dramatically,” Clifford says. “E​veryday Australians are feeling it in the way they’ve got to eke out the food that they’re getting.” Foodbank’s chief executive, Brianna Casey, also says they have not seen any sign of the need waning. “I think what we’re seeing is the compounding impact of hardship in the community. We’re seeing people who went into the pandemic in a really vulnerable position, coming out the other side in an even more vulnerable position. We’re seeing the cumulative impacts of natural disasters, which are increasing in intensity and frequency and duration,” she says. The food relief services are lobbying the federal government for increased funding, in particular for natural disaster relief preparedness. “Unfortunately, we went into Covid in a really precarious situation, because we had so much pressure on our services arising from the black summer bushfires,” says Casey. “We need to get ahead of this. For every natural disaster that might only be a couple of days or a couple of weeks in the crisis phase, it is several years in the recovery phase.” There are warnings that food prices are expected to rise even further in the coming months, as supermarkets pass on price hikes from suppliers, with some analysts estimating that inflation on groceries – already at 5.3% – could increase to 12% across the year. While Secondbite says there are no signs of a reduction in the volume of donated food, shipping delays are causing some supply issues. The pressure shows no sign of easing on the frontline, though. Vinnies representatives say demand at the city-based soup van alone has gone up 25% in the past month. “Our goal is not to be needed,” says Walton. “The fact that need is increasing at such a big scale – it’s good that we can be there to help, but it’s not a good story that it’s growing so much.”",News/Australia news,"Demand for food relief soars as Covid, inflation and natural disasters pile pressure on the vulnerable",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/demand-for-food-relief-soars-as-covid-inflation-and-natural-disasters-pile-pressure-on-the-vulnerable
5/15/2022,"In the ultra-marginal electorate of Chisholm, in Melbourne’s eastern suburbs, every vote counts. So much so that both Liberal MP Gladys Liu, who holds the seat by just 1,100 votes, and Labor’s candidate, Carina Garland, spent hours outside the Holy Family Parish church in Mount Waverley on Monday, introducing themselves to early voters. Both women wear black sneakers but take different approaches. Liu stands closest to the road and begins waving at people as soon as they begin their walk up the driveway, towards the gauntlet of volunteers standing outside the mid-century church. “Hi I’m Gladys, how are you? Are you voting today?” she says. Liu attempts to shake the hand of everyone who walks past – including teachers on their way to the adjacent primary school (she knows a couple by name), parents on pick-up duty and their young children. Even those who make it quite clear they don’t intend to vote for her are greeted warmly. Anyone who stops is handed a how-to-vote flyer. “Vote Liberal for a strong economy, strong future,” she says, rarely deviating from the line. Garland has fewer, but seemingly more significant, exchanges. An aged-care worker approaches her to tell her she has her support. They chat for a couple of minutes about Labor’s plan to raise aged-care workers’ wages. Another woman tells Garland their families attend the same church. They launch into a discussion about the need for funding certainty for the ABC. Meanwhile, a young Labor volunteer stands behind Liu. “Vote Labor for a better future,” the woman says, before ushering voters over to Garland. “Here’s our candidate.” As an indicator of how important the seat is for Labor, the party’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, arrives to hand out flyers for half an hour and pose for photos. (Garland will go on to attend a press conference with Anthony Albanese and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, the next day). Several voters stop to chat after recognising Liu, who has a high profile, particularly among Chinese voters in the electorate, which covers suburbs including Ashwood, Burwood, Box Hill, Glen Waverley, Mount Waverley and Wheelers Hill, as well as parts of Blackburn and Chadstone. About 56% of people in the electorate were born overseas, including almost 13% from China, making it one of the most diverse in the country. Weekly wage and home ownership rates largely reflect the national average. When elected in 2019, the Liu became the first overseas-born, Chinese woman to win a seat in the federal parliament’s lower house. Since then, she has been embroiled in several controversies, including over signs put up at polling booths around Chisholm on election day in 2019 that looked like official AEC signs and directed voters in Chinese that the “correct way” to vote was for the Liberal candidate. Liu was cleared of any role in creating them. But Garland says it remains a concern of voters. “I have people coming up to me all just warning me to keep an eye out. I really hate that it eroded people’s trust in our democratic system, because I think we have one of the best in the world,” she says. “It’s another reason we need an anti-corruption commission, so people’s faith is restored again.” Garland also cites aged-care conditions, the rising cost of living and Australia’s lack of manufacturing self-sufficiency as issues repeatedly raised by voters. But Liu says the voters she has spoken to are more optimistic. “People are happy with how the Morrison government has been handling the economy and the low unemployment rate at the moment. People are happy because they’ve got a job,” she says. “They are glad that the kids can go back to school and parents can get back to the new normal.” The voters Guardian Australia spoke to in Chisholm were not particularly engaged in the campaign, or politics generally. Glen Waverley resident Kiki, who did not want her surname published, isn’t familiar with Liu, Garland or Albanese, though she knows Scott Morrison. “I don’t hate him, I don’t really like him, I just accept him,” she says as she enjoys breakfast at Mocha Jo’s cafe in Glen Waverley. “It’s a hard position he’s in, but in the end he’s the one that gets blamed if something happens.” She doesn’t know who she will vote for yet. Sitting at a nearby table is Peter Killeen. He says he hasn’t been following the campaign closely but will be voting for Labor. “I used to vote Liberal until the last election but now I can’t because they couldn’t lie straight in bed,” he says. Burwood resident Roman, who also asked for his full name not to be used, credits Morrison with keeping the economy going during the pandemic but says many workers have been forgotten, including those in his industry, the performing arts. “And he’s loud and he’s boisterous and I don’t know if I can take any more of that,” he says outside Box Hill town hall’s early voting centre. Roman was a volunteer with Labor’s 2019 candidate for Chisholm, Jennifer Yang. He says her campaign was launched in the same building with much fanfare – it was the first time both Labor and the Liberals ran female Chinese-Australians in the seat. “This time it’s been more mild,” he says, admitting he doesn’t know much about Garland, who is of Italian background, reflecting the older migrant communities in the area. At Jells Park, friends Emma and Lorraine, who both live in Glen Waverley, say they have election fatigue. “It [the campaign] is too long,” Lorraine says. “It gets a bit childish, this snapping at each other,” Emma adds. Lorraine hasn’t made up her mind on who she is voting for, but says Morrison has done a “damn good job” despite the challenges of the pandemic. Emma agrees. “It would have been difficult for anybody,” she says. The duo, however, have differing views on Liu: Emma says she’s “not a fan” while Lorraine says she likes her. “Let me put it this way, she’s up and about,” Lorraine says. Both the candidates are confident. “Everyone has been really encouraging,” Garland says. “Of course, you’re not going to get every vote, but it does feel very positive towards Labor, and it’s just been so nice of people to go out of their way to let me know that they want to support me and they hope that Labor wins, that means a lot.” The former union official says she’ll be at the early voting centre until it closes at 8pm. She also visited Box Hill town hall earlier in the day. “I’ll be doing this every day for the next two weeks,” she says. “Every vote matters.” Liu says she’s been at the early voting centre since 7.45am and will also stay until it closes. She says she’s also had a positive reception. “I know the local community, they know me, a lot of people just come up to me and say, ‘Hi Gladys’, without me introducing myself,” she says. “They say, ‘I’ve met you at the Glen, I’ve met you at Burwood One, I’ve met you at Hamilton Place.’ It’s reassuring that they know who I am.” ",News/Australia news,"Ultra-marginal Chisholm hopes for a milder ride, but scrabble for votes still intense",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/ultra-marginal-chisholm-hopes-for-a-milder-ride-but-scrabble-for-votes-still-intense
5/15/2022,"On a sticky autumn Saturday, three weeks out from the election, Greens candidate Max Chandler-Mather is going door-to-door, talking to voters in the southern Brisbane suburb of Carina. Many people greet him with a twinkle of recognition. One woman offers him a glass of water. Harsha, a Sri Lankan-Australian, tells Chandler-Mather he’s the first candidate or local member for the seat of Griffith to knock on his door in the 20 years he’s lived at the property. Chandler-Mather’s campaign has become the biggest in the Australian Greens’ history – the party has poured an unprecedented amount of money and time into a seat Labor has held for all but two of the past 45 years. This is the electorate that sent former prime minister Kevin Rudd to Canberra and is now home to Labor’s environment spokesperson, Terri Butler, who holds the seat with a 2.9% margin. In recent years, the Greens have won seats on the Brisbane city council, and claimed the state electorate south of the Brisbane river, where Griffith is based. That foothold has underpinned a very unconventional sort of campaign. Most outsider candidates spend their time fomenting a mood for change. Instead, Chandler-Mather is acting like the incumbent, organising local forums and, with volunteers, planting community gardens and handing out Covid-19 care packages. After the Brisbane floods, they helped people clean out their homes and dropped off supplies. When he hits the doors – he estimates they’ve knocked on 80,000 over 14 months – Chandler-Mather says he approaches the interaction as a sort of “social work”, rather than asking for a vote. “The theory underlying our campaign strategies … is that there is a growing disillusionment with politics – that people feel like politics is now completely disconnected from their lives,” Chandler-Mather says. “The way to rebuild that relationship and give them hope [that] something can change is to reach them in their homes.” The seat of Griffith covers inner-city suburbs on the south side of the Brisbane River, from the Gateway Bridge to Dutton Park. While the Greens have strongholds in West End and parts of South Brisbane, as you move further away from the CBD, more Labor and LNP pockets appear. To bolster their chances at victory, the Greens have attempted to build a grassroots community campaign that centres on meaningful relationships, says University of Queensland political scientist Dr Glenn Kefford. “It’s a set of techniques which have been used by the Greens in Queensland for about six years now, going back to Jon Sri’s election to the council in 2016,” Kefford says. “The academic literature on this says the best way to persuade voters is to have a one-on-one conversation with them … [and] they’ve pretty much not stopped door-knocking since the last federal election.” But Kefford says the Greens are mistaken if they think victory will be easy. “Terri Butler’s team are out on the doors as well and they also use other practices like phone banking. When you’ve got a relatively well-liked local candidate, it does make it quite challenging,” he says. Kefford says as time’s gone on, the electoral contest has shifted in Labor’s favour, making it tougher for the Greens to win the seat. “What we see from the polls is that it looks like Labor’s primary is going to increase … I think it’s going to be very hard for the Greens to take Griffith, given the greater contest that’s playing out,” he says. “In an election where the government looks likely to lose and you have a pretty unpopular prime minister … they might go, ‘well, I really want to get rid of Morrison, so I’ll vote Labor in the House’.” Labor was outpolled on first-preference votes in the 2019 election – attracting 31% of the vote compared with the LNP’s 41% – but ultimately retained the seat thanks to the Greens vote, which reached 23%. Butler was contacted for comment. She told the ABC this week that she is “working hard to retain the trust of the people of this electorate”. “I never take this seat for granted – it’s always a tight contest,” Butler told the ABC. “It’s been the case for me, it’s been the case for Kevin Rudd.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning As pre-polling kicks off, Chandler-Mather remains optimistic about his chances. He’s confident that he’s on the cusp of victory, with few votes needed to secure the “positive change” he’s been promising voters. Chandler-Mather says he’s won a surprising amount of support from former Liberal and One Nation voters who want to see climate action and agree with getting dental into Medicare. “They’ve come over to us because they finally heard a platform that represents them,” he says. “The scale of this campaign and the degree to which it’s embedded in local communities is … a scale beyond anything the Greens have done before,” Chandler-Mather says. “This electorate is increasingly becoming a fierce race between Labor and the Greens, and the Liberals are going to almost certainly get blown away here.”",News/Australia news,Social work as a political strategy: Greens aim to grow a grassroots campaign in a Brisbane seat,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/social-work-as-a-political-strategy-greens-aim-to-grow-a-grassroots-campaign-in-a-brisbane-seat
5/15/2022,"In a dark walled rehearsal space, three actors run lines. “Are you OK with the word disability?” starts Simon Laherty. A devoted fan of Britney Spears, he wears a black hoodie emblazoned with the singer and her catchcry “Oops …” “I don’t think it describes me,” Sarah Mainwaring retorts in a steady voice, each syllable carrying deep feeling. The third actor, Scott Price, strokes his Ned Kelly beard, then puts a finger in his hot chocolate and absentmindedly sucks it. “Look, I am a disabled person,” he says, his words racing. “I am proud, and I don’t want to have to weave my way around language.” The trio are members of the internationally lauded, Geelong-based Back to Back Theatre, an ensemble who are neurodiverse or intellectually disabled or both. Their latest, group-devised work, The Shadow Whose Prey the Hunter Becomes, casts a wry and acute glance at the slave labour forced upon the intellectually disabled – and asks what the rise of artificial intelligence will mean for the neurotypical. Will those who consider themselves “normal”, as the actors put it, be patronised by genius machines? Watching the actors block out the scene is Back to Back’s longtime artistic director, Bruce Gladwin. Gladwin sits with his hands on his knees. 196cm tall and straight-backed, he has the ability to remain utterly still, beholding the performers with preternatural focus. As a young person, the director, now 55, had “constant mission drift,” but he found his calling in 1989. Gladwin had just finished a teaching degree and was working in community theatre when a mentor told him the most interesting Australian acting was happening in a place regarded as a cultural backwater, the industrial town of Geelong. As he bought a ticket to see the newly formed Back to Back, his mother’s voice was in his ear. He’d been raised not to stare at disabled people, and he’d just paid to do so. That show was based on a true story about a man and woman who met at a disco at Caloola, a large asylum outside the Victorian town of Sunbury. The pair, who instantly became best friends, would discover during the state’s de-institutionalisation process that they were also brother and sister. “There was a moment in that show where they are representing the disco in the institution,” Gladwin recalls. “And one of the characters who’s playing a worker says, “All right, everyone up on the dancefloor!” And virtually everyone in the audience also got up on the dancefloor. And it took about 15 minutes to kind of bring the whole performance under control.” Right there, Gladwin had an aesthetic epiphany. The anarchy, the collectivism, the riotous anti-hierarchical spirit beguiled him. He felt he was present at the beginning of an art movement, and whenever Gladwin could, he worked on projects with the company until in 1999, he became the Back to Back’s artistic director. “When I started,” Gladwin remembers, “I said to the actors, ‘What do you want to do?’ and they basically said, ‘We want to tour the world.’ And we’ve done that. So that’s like a kind of big tick,” he notes with understatement. Over the last two decades, Back to Back Theatre has performed on the main stages of the world’s leading cultural institutions, leaving in their wake rhapsodic reviews. Alison Croggon described Food Court (2008) as the rare show that “reminds you that theatre is burning glass, art [that] sears through the intellect into the tissue of deep feeling.” Ganesh Versus the Third Reich (2011), about the elephant-headed god reclaiming the ancient Hindu swastika symbol, was described by The New York Times as “a vital sense-sharpening tonic for theatregoers”. Time Out called Lady Eats Apple (2016) a creation taking us to “a place of pure love”. By touring up to 24 weeks a year, Back to Back could guarantee their performers a wage. “And for some of our actors, when they first started working with the company, a lot of them just didn’t have their own money. We would go on tour and we’d hand them a $50 per diem, and that was the first time in their life that they had that level of autonomy.” Then came the plan-burying force of Covid, pulling The Shadow Whose Prey the Hunter Becomes from the international circuit. The company threw away their touring schedule and instead filmed the play, with a technical crew consisting of nine members with disabilities who were mentored by industry stalwarts. Unlike Back to Back performances made for “big stages in Europe”, the ensemble were working without “smoke and mirrors.” Everything was stripped back, a return to the punk aesthetic that Gladwin had fallen in love with all those years ago. The director was adjusting to the complexities of all that had been lost and found, when in late 2021, he fielded an unusual request. The conveners of the Norwegian Government’s biennial International Ibsen Award asked for the entire company to gather for a meeting. The gathering’s purpose was not disclosed, and yet it had to take place in a studio with multiple cameras. Gladwin knew the company had been nominated for the Ibsen Award, regarded as the Nobel of theatre, and “the stakes were getting higher.” Nevertheless when, with “typical Norwegian restraint”, it was announced that Back to Back were the 2022 winners and recipients of the 2.5m Norwegian kroner prize, the ensemble were genuinely amazed. On the call, the jury members – theatre identities from around the world – read a collective testimony recognising Back to Back’s astonishing ability to “dissect the unspoken imaginings of society” so as to “reveal the audience to themselves”. “After the last few years of Covid to feel that you are a part of an international community had a strong impact,” Gladwin admits. “It was lovely hearing people talk not just about one work, but multiple works over the years, from different festivals and locations.” In the wave of publicity that followed, however, Gladwin noticed a narrative emerging, along the lines of, “‘Aren’t you shocked? You’re just a little theatre company that no one knows about, and you’ve won this huge award!’ And yes, we were shocked. “And yes, we do feel privileged, but at the same time, the actors have been touring major festivals for two decades and working really hard. And they are really well known and respected for what they do … they deserve it.” In the rehearsal space, Laherty, Mainwaring and Price, who have acted together for the last 15 years, give each other support amid missed cues and perfect deliveries. They each bring a different intensity and charisma to the stage. Mainwaring, who has an acquired brain injury as a result of a childhood car accident, is mesmerising to watch for the oceanic emotion underlying her lines. Laherty, with his expressive face and plain delivery, anchors the piece. Price, who is autistic, has a restless, unpredictable, Brando-like energy. Mid-rehearsal he suddenly leaves the room, returning with a letter that he thrusts in Gladwin’s face. “What’s wrong with this?” he demands. Gladwin wonders if the punctuation is off. “No!” It turns out the letter, congratulating Price on the Ibsen Award, comes from the school where the actor was incessantly bullied. Price returns to his lines: “For thousands of years,” he announces, “people with disabilities have been abandoned in woods, kept in cellars, tied to beds, experimented on, isolated, gassed, drugged, devalued, victimised, dehumanised, sterilised and euthanised.” “Given that,” Simon deadpans, as if to the audience, “I’m amazed anyone turned up tonight, at all.” And that audience, when it arrives, may well be watching Australia’s most acclaimed theatre company in flight. The Shadow Whose Prey the Hunter Becomes will be performed nationally in May 2022. The film version will screen later in 2022.",Arts/Stage,Of punk and prizes: Notes from the Australian neurodiverse theatre company lauded around the world,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/15/of-punk-and-prizes-notes-from-the-australian-neurodiverse-theatre-company-lauded-around-the-world
5/15/2022,"In the early evening, light leeches quickly from Auckland’s central business district, and the people follow. Offices regurgitate workers on to the streets, but their numbers are still thin – of the thousands sent to work from home, many have yet to return. Shopfronts on Queen Street, the main shopping artery, are pockmarked by For Lease signs. By late evening, the street is deserted. On many shop windows, owners have rolled down steel grates. Already emptied out by Covid-19, some of New Zealand’s cities are now facing a spike in crime. Police data released to RNZ indicated violent crime rates in Auckland, the largest city, were up 30% from pre-pandemic levels, and remained steady compared to the year before – despite months of lockdown keeping people indoors. In Wellington, recent shootings left some residents shaken. A series of “ram-raids”, where offenders drive cars into glass shopfronts and rob them, have dominated the headlines. The age of some alleged offenders has come as a particular shock: police report apprehending children as young as 11 behind the wheels of stolen cars. By international standards, New Zealand’s cities tend to be relatively safe, and headlines in recent months sometimes contain a hint of incredulity. “Why is there gang warfare in central Wellington?” one asks. “‘What the hell is happening?’: Another ram raid in Auckland,” says another. Social service agencies and police say that behind the headlines is a simmering mixture of social deprivation, exacerbated by the stresses of the pandemic, and a cohort of New Zealanders who slipped through the cracks of government support schemes. In downtown Auckland, the Māori wardens move through the shopping district in a small flock of hi-vis vests. They pause to give a cigarette to a woman they call “auntie”. She sits near the base of the Sky Tower, Auckland city’s best-known symbol, feet bare, beanie pulled down to her eyes. “We say auntie, uncle, cousin, because they are an auntie and uncle or cousin to somebody. It’s that simple,” says Blaine Hoete, one of the wardens who looks after central Auckland. The wardens call themselves the “eyes and ears” of the city. Many have spent years giving out food and assistance, or walking on community patrols. On the streets, they say, there is growing desperation. “Even though the government has poured a lot of money into the Covid sector, there’s still a gap in terms of those that are hooked up,” says warden Grace Ngaroimata Le Gros of Te Tai Taukerau. Those that fall through those cracks, she says, “don’t even get looked at – so they struggle and revert to the streets, and small petty crime”. They are particularly concerned for children and teenagers, who started dropping off-radar when Covid-19 closed schools. Last week, principals said one in five students was absent last term. Hoete says some have been gone much longer. “You have rangatahi [young people] that weren’t going to school for … two years. That’s a long time,” he says. “We’re talking about the children … who are street-smart, but educationally below the line. And their street smarts took over.” In recent years the makeup of the city has also shifted dramatically, as the government – short on state housing – opted to place those in urgent need into motels. “You had a lot of emergency housing spilling out on to the streets,” he says. “And they didn’t spill out on to the bright, lit up streets – they spilled into the dark dingy streets.” Those surrounding streets have also been empty. While formal lockdowns and most restrictions ended in March, repopulation of New Zealand’s inner cities has been gradual. According to pedestrian count data by the Heart of the City, Auckland’s central business association, pedestrian numbers are still well below this time last year, with some areas down 40% or more. That emptiness may be a key reason for the inner-city crime spikes, says University of Canterbury criminologist Jarrod Gilbert. He cites the theory that for most crime to occur, it needs a likely offender, a suitable target and the absence of a capable guardian – people who, simply by their presence, discourage crime from happening. Even if offenders and targets remain the same, in New Zealand’s cities right now, “there’s the issue of capable guardians”, he says. “Spaces that are populated by large amounts of people inhibit crime.” And emptiness can beget emptiness: if people feel unsafe, they’re less likely to come out – making environments feel increasingly deserted and vulnerable. The rise in crime itself, and the maelstrom of media coverage that accompanied it, are becoming a political issue for the government, which this month announced more than half a billion dollars in extra police funding, one of the biggest spending packages announced in the lead-up to the annual budget announcement. The $562m, to be spent on police over the next four years, will create a ratio assigning one police officer to every 480 people. But the Māori wardens – alongside other social service agencies - say the robberies and ram-raids are symptoms of a set of social problems that New Zealand has struggled to make progress on: housing affordability, inequality and the rising cost of living. “If we wanted to address the situation, it [has to be] the housing situation, says Hoete. “And if we wanted to address the influence of rangatahi, and all that trauma that they’re causing … we need to remove the financial stress within the homes.” The return of people to the city’s streets will also help, says Matarora Smith. Even in recent weeks, there’s been a shift, she says, as she walks to the office’s exit.“It’s cool seeing that much people. Because for a while it was dead.”",News/World news,"After Covid, crime swells in New Zealand’s empty city centres",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/after-covid-swells-in-new-zealands-empty-city-centres
5/15/2022,"Airbnb has just announced the biggest change to its site in a decade. The online accommodation marketplace has redesigned its site to move away from the “archaic” ways of booking by encouraging visitors to focus on the type of home they want to stay in rather than the destination. Now, the homepage features labelled icons connecting you to barns, mansions, treehouses, domes and even islands. It has also introduced “split stays” to make it easier to share your time between two places. I’m just back from Italy, where I indulged my Airbnb habit, and I’m hoping this change – in part Airbnb’s answer to over-tourism in certain places and to the site’s role in inflating the cost of local rents – will be helpful. It has always been a tough pill to swallow that my stays in New York or Paris have in some way contributed to raising rental costs to locals. And yet Airbnb has become so integral to the way that I and many others travel. Frankly, I can’t go back to holiday resorts and hotels and so my fingers are crossed. There’s only so long I can compromise my ethics to feed my fascination for seeing what other people’s houses look like. As a regular Observer books critic, I can power through a book in a few days if need be, but lately I’ve been struggling to start anything that isn’t for work. I can’t seem to allow myself to sink into a story without being seduced by a meme or some banter in my WhatsApp group chats. Like a lot of people, I began reading much more during the pandemic. A quarter of UK adults have kept up with lockdown reading habits even after the restrictions were eased, according to a new survey, but not me. I’m struggling to stay afloat in an ocean of unread books – yet I can’t stop buying them. The ratio of books I’m reading to buying is easily one to five. Still, I’m trying to not feel too guilty about it. I’ve come to accept that disciplined reading is a seasonal thing. When I worked at a gallery as an invigilator in my early 20s, I powered through short story collections with a ferocity during my shifts. When I started a book club with friends, feminist texts were my sustenance. I’ve also gone months without touching a single book. I’m putting it all down to socialising too much and the fact it’s been a stellar few months for celebrity scandals. I know that the fire in me to finish a novel or a memoir will return, if only to smugly share my “favourite books I’ve read in 2022” list on social media at the end of the year. What’s the point in reading if it’s not to feel like you’re better than everyone else? It was frustrating to read about the West Indian domino players in Maida Hill market square in London who were summoned to court by Westminster city council and accused of being too noisy. It was heartbreaking to hear the story of Ernest Theophile, a 73-year-old interviewed by the Guardian, talking about how important the square is to him and how he and others are being threatened with jail if they are caught “playing loud, amplified music, drinking alcohol and shouting and swearing”. It’s hard not to see the whole thing as being anti-Black. (Whatever the reason, on Friday, central London county court found the council’s decision “flawed” and “untenable”.) Remember in 2015 when a group of Black women were kicked off a Napa Valley Wine Train tour after they were said to be laughing too loudly? Different environment, same sentiments. Personally, I think these gatherings, noise and all, are what community is all about. To criminalise gatherings and laughter and fun is to erode the very culture that makes London London.

5/15/2022,"“Extended weeks,” said my palliative care doctor when I asked for my prognosis. “Extended?” cried my daughter. “What does that even mean?” “It means we can’t be more specific,” she responded. Meanwhile Chris and I were stunned speechless. Weeks! We thought that I would drift on the way that I have been drifting indefinitely. I have to say that this was some (extended) weeks ago now, and things are much the same. I am wobbly on my feet and hobble like a penguin. Yesterday we went to Bronte beach where we had fish and chips and I sat in the car and watched Chris throw the ball for our dog Donnie. When we came home and the family attempted to prise me out of the car, my legs gave away and I fell to the pavement like a sack of potatoes, complete with a hysterical cry which brought the neighbours out. Chris heaved me to my feet (I worry about that man’s back); my daughter rushed over with a wheelchair and they pushed me back inside, where I went straight to bed to recover. Yet every day I wake up and wonder if today is the day, the beginning of the end. But apart from the extreme wobbliness and weakness of legs, I eat like a horse and seem relatively robust. I spend much of my days sleeping, receiving the occasional visitor and trying to write. What can I write about? My pet subject, it seems, which is dying. I have stopped taking medication, apart from pain killers. So why am I not dead yet? When does that happen? And how will it happen? I hope peacefully and comfortably, lying picturesquely on my bed, an expression of gentle wisdom on my face, my family in close attendance. I have some pretty nighties in readiness. “Three weeks,” my GP told my daughter. Sheesh. I think at that point we may have stopped asking. That was at least three weeks ago. At night, Chris lies beside me and we reminisce about the adventures we have had over the 40 years we have been together. It’s probably my favourite part of my day. Then he starts to nod off and I get annoyed with him, because I want to continue reminiscing interminably. I don’t have a lot of other things to talk about. Sometimes during the day one of the girls flops herself down beside me and we chat and do a bit of online shopping, or my mother will take that place when she’s up from Melbourne, and we talk about her family, including the aunt with the brittle bones which broke whenever you hugged her, which is much less amusing (why was it ever amusing?) now that I have brittle bones. We have a neighbour named Mel, a nutritionist, who cooks dinner for us almost every night. Last night it was homemade pizza and pavlova (she knows I love pavlova). She bakes us sourdough and banana bread and on Anzac Day, she baked Anzac biscuits for the entire street. We are a bit anxious about the money she must be spending on groceries to cook for us every night, but she won’t take any remuneration from us. We bought her a restaurant voucher as a token of appreciation, but this felt like meagre reparation for such unbelievable ongoing kindness and generosity. And it was not as if we knew her very well before I got sick – just a wave across the street as we walked our dogs. Now she has become a big part of our lives. She even caters for our vegan daughter Emmeline. We have to watch that we don’t take her for granted: “What is Mel cooking for us tonight?” we start to ponder around 5 o’clock. There’s a knock on the door around 6.30 and she breezes in with our dinner. I often ask myself, would it have even occurred to me to do the same had our roles been reversed? I am not so worried about the “extended weeks” prognosis these days as I seem to stay much the same. The latest is rib pain on my left hand side which hurts when I breathe in deeply. Then I let out one of my “Urrgghh!” cries and the whole family leaps to attention. What a drama queen I have become. I sleep a lot. “I need a project,” I lament. Chris suggests I write about some of our travel adventures. It occurred to me that I could write about us in 2006 driving innocently, like the hapless Griswold family, past burnt-out buses into Oaxaca, Mexico, which was the scene of great civil unrest after a teachers’ strike. We had gone there for the Day of the Dead celebrations, but it seemed all the gringos had wisely cleared out. Except for us. Instead we drove in with two young girls in the car. Busloads of armed Federales passed us on the way. Chris and I looked at each other and thought, “What the hell have we ventured into?” Violent eruptions would break out in the street, and I would hasten the girls into doorways, cursing myself for being so naive as to bring the children into a situation we did not understand. Usually, I keep a travel diary but in this instance I didn’t. I regret this because I have forgotten so much. So it is up to Chris and me to reminisce, and I try to squeeze in as much reminiscing as I can. What do I most like to reminisce about? Well, apart from the girls and some of the antics they got up to, I like to reminisce about our various marine adventures: seeing killer whales swimming in the wild, swimming with whale sharks, and the biggest highlight of all, swimming with humpbacks in Tonga. How to describe jumping off a boat with your snorkel and seeing a huge barnacled creature, as big as a bus, looming up beneath you? At one point we were caught up in a “heat run”, where male whales compete ferociously for a female. I remember sticking my head underwater and seeing about eight whales swimming beneath me at top speed in their pursuit. “Yikes,” I thought. “This is no place for me.” I clambered back on to the boat as fast as I could. So I come back to my question: why am I not dead yet when my remaining days were numbered in weeks? And how will I know when the big day finally looms?

5/15/2022,"It seemed like an innocuous amendment to an obscure piece of legislation. But when Labor in May 2020 quietly amended a government bill on funding for NBN Co’s regional expansion, the opposition was actually laying the groundwork for a policy it hoped could win over crucial city voters in the federal election, which was then two years away. Now, a week out from polling day, a Labor source has revealed for the first time the lengths the party went to in order to develop its National Broadband Network policy. When it comes to the NBN, data is always key. Labor wanted to know, once the network rollout was completed in 2020, what improvements could be made. Specifically, the opposition was keen to upgrade as many homes as possible from fibre-to-the-node (FttN) to fibre-to-the-home (FttH) as cost-effectively as possible. The biggest hurdle, however, was the lack of data. Other than NBN Co’s website – where you can plug in an address and see the technology type – there was no Australia-wide data on what technology was being used, house by house and suburb by suburb. A third party had managed to scrape the data from NBN Co’s website manually, but it wasn’t 100% accurate. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning This takes us back to May 2020, when the government was rushing to pass legislation that would tax fixed-line networks to help pay for NBN regional networks. Labor was willing to support the legislation – but with some minor amendments. One of the amendments added in the Senate required NBN Co to provide mapping data about every NBN-serving area module within 150 days. The data would show the dominant technology type used and the date people could order a connection in that area. The Labor source says the Coalition didn’t raise any objections. The opposition wasn’t sure whether the government understood, at the time, the true intention of slipping the amendment into the bill. But, six months later, the data was uploaded to the government’s National Map website. Anyone could now overlay maps of which technology type was used in every part of Australia. The data allowed Labor to do a spatial density analysis of homes within fibre-to-the-node areas and determine where it was most cost-effective to upgrade the connections. NBN Co then started announcing which 2m homes it would offer fibre upgrades too – but Labor was already ahead of the game. The Coalition had promised to add 2m premises at a cost of $2.9bn. But Labor was able to determine an additional 1.5m homes could be upgraded for a further $2.4bn. The opposition pledged to move 3.5m premises in total from FttN to fibre-to-the-home at a cost of $5.3bn. Beyond that 3.5m figure, the spatial density dropped off quickly and it was much more expensive to upgrade, the data obtained via Labor’s legislative amendment showed. The data means Labor, during the campaign, could provide precise local upgrade numbers to its candidates on the hustings. The shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has posted on her Facebook page that 106,000 homes in western Sydney will be upgraded to full fibre under the plan, including 15,000 in her electorate of Greenway, for example. Labor deliberately announced its NBN policy in November 2021, well before the election, to give the communications minister, Paul Fletcher, plenty of time to look for any holes in it. (He wouldn’t be able to ask NBN Co to crunch any numbers once the campaign started and the government was in caretaker mode.) Fletcher made some vague claims about Labor’s upgrades targeting marginal electorates and being wasteful spending. But he didn’t highlight any substantial issues with the opposition’s policy. Guardian Australia contacted Fletcher’s office for comments and was directed to NBN Co. As a government-owned business, it said it was unable to comment while in the government was in caretaker mode. The suburbs set to most benefit under Labor’s policy are not the most marginal. The plan would more double fibre-to-the-home in the safe Liberal-held seat of Flinders and the Labor-held seat of Newcastle, according to modelling seen by the Guardian. Under the Coalition’s policy, the Labor-held seat of Perth and the Liberal-held seat of Leichhardt would receive the greatest number of upgrades. South Australia and Tasmania are the two states set to benefit the most from Labor’s upgrade. Under the announced Coalition plan, to date, about 29% of FttN premises are set to get an upgrade in those two states, compared with over 50% in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and WA.",News/Technology,Revealed: how a crafty Labor move on the NBN is being used to win over voters,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/15/revealed-how-a-crafty-labor-move-on-the-nbn-is-being-used-to-win-over-voters
5/15/2022,"Samantha Hodgson met all the criteria for a possible heart attack: “A tight, crushing pain that started in my shoulders and spread through my chest and ribcage. I was dizzy, and the pain had escalated over 24 hours so that it hurt to breathe.” Hodgson was also on day nine of being infected with Covid-19, and until the chest pain hit, she had been feeling better. According to health guidelines, she needed an ambulance for a suspected heart attack. But when Hodgson, who lives in Potts Point in Sydney, rang triple zero, the operator told her, “You could be waiting a while, we don’t know how long it might be”. In too much pain to walk far, she put on two masks and called an Uber to take her to the nearest public hospital. When arrived she was told to wait outside in the rain because she had Covid. “I sat under a little tarp outside of emergency, next to a carpark,” Hodgson said. “I stayed out there for at least two hours. I don’t remember exactly as I was so out of it. “A doctor came and saw me after about one and a half hours, and she said they really needed to get me inside but they had no beds. I begged her to put me in a wheelchair and stick me in a cupboard to treat me, because I wanted pain relief and to know what was going on with my chest. But she just said: ‘There is nowhere to put you’.” Hodgson’s discharge letter said there was no concerning cause of her pain and her symptoms were Covid-related. One month later, Hodgson is still trying to get access to her discharge notes, including the results of the ECG. “I feel like Covid pain has become so normalised in emergency rooms that my chest pain wasn’t taken seriously,” she said. Hodgson’s story goes to many of the health system issues that have led to “access block”: the term used when emergency patients are delayed being put in an inpatient bed. The relationship between access block and poor patient outcomes, including death, is well established. Patients are struggling to even make it out of the ambulance, let alone be admitted. A report by the Australian Medical Association published on Thursday revealed no jurisdiction is meeting their targets for getting patients out of ambulances and into the care of emergency department staff in a safe and acceptable timeframe. The AMA national president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said this ambulance ramping means patients are not receiving timely care, and that paramedics can’t respond to new emergencies. “This is what we see when our public hospitals are in logjam,” he said. Sydney physician and the president of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, Dr Clare Skinner, said rising Covid cases and a consistently high death rate had highlighted the pressures hospitals face. But the pandemic and the easing of restrictions is not the cause of access block and the hospital crisis, she said. Access block has many other longstanding and unaddressed causes, such as the struggles for resourcing and funding being faced by other sectors including general practice, allied health, disability support and aged care. Patients cannot be discharged from hospitals to free up beds if there is nowhere for them to go because of National Disability Insurance Scheme and home care funding shortages, or if they are homeless. Patients also end up in hospital who could be treated in aged care – if only that sector had the nurses and other health workers available. When there are wait lists and high costs for mental health care in the community, those patients also end up in hospital. “We are seeing a large increase in people presenting to emergency with mental health problems, psychological distress and drug and alcohol issues,” Skinner said. Funding new hospital beds for these patients is little help if the staff needed to treat them are leaving in droves. Skinner says senior clinicians in particular are leaving, retiring early, or cutting back their shifts because of burnout, stress and “moral injury”. Nurses, too, have had enough. The many years of specialised training they have cannot be quickly or easily replaced. “Healthcare workers from around Australia are saying the current conditions in emergency departments are the worst they have ever seen in their careers, and that right now access block is worse than during the major Covid outbreaks,” Skinner said. Woeful investment by successive federal governments in preventative health, rising out-of-pocket health costs, lack of GPs and specialists in rural and regional areas, and difficulty in finding bulk-billed medical appointments mean patients are not being treated early and end up in hospital with more complex problems. It’s why just focusing on hospitals – whether funding beds or hiring and training new staff – will never be enough to rectify the crisis in the hospital system, Skinner says. Any measures need to coincide with major reform in other areas of health and community support. “With all of these systems such as social support and welfare, aged care, community health … as the load grows on those, the backup plan for all of them is the emergency department,” Skinner said. During the major Covid-19 outbreaks, both federal and state governments diverted resources to the health system to meet acute needs. Elective surgery was also postponed to free up health workers to focus on the acute cases. “But in business-as-usual times, we don’t have that and I think we need the federal government to step up and maintain the extra funding of the hospital system that was made available during Covid times,” Skinner said. “We couldn’t postpone surgery indefinitely, so now we are trying to do everything, catching up on surgeries and care delayed during the pandemic, while also treating urgent patients and still treating acute Covid cases.” As a result the number of patients, the complexity of their cases and the costs of treating them continues to grow. States are responsible for managing hospitals but the federal government shares responsibility for paying for them. The federal government pays 45% of the growth in delivering hospital services each year, capped at 6.5%, but state and territory governments are united in their call for the commonwealth’s share to be permanently raised to 50% and the cap scrapped. “There are people who fall between the cracks of the state and federal systems, and we tend to see blame and cost-shifting between those systems,” Skinner said. Guardian Australia contacted numerous major hospitals to ask about the key issues they are currently facing and what is needed to address them. None responded to requests for comment. An “exhausted” senior surgeon working across two Melbourne hospitals, who cannot be named as he has not been given permission from his workplace to speak to media, told Guardian Australia that “this hospital crisis has not been caused by the pandemic”. “I think people are so sick and tired of Covid being used as an excuse for what’s happening, or as the reason to address it. Covid merely exposed and worsened the situation. Bringing back restrictions won’t bring back the nurses, it won’t inject money into all of the areas of the community and the health system where it is needed.” He fears that because health workers have been speaking about the system in crisis for so long, politicians are “losing the importance” of their message; and all the while patients are suffering, staff are overwhelmed and system-wide reform and funding is still lacking. “I am worried about what happens if it takes five or 10 years for anything meaningful to happen to fix this, because reform takes time,” he said. “Because at the moment, I don’t even know how we will get through the next six months. How will we cope through winter? We’re going to see more surgeries being cancelled because of staff shortages and because of Covid or flu infections, and more pressure on emergency departments. “And all the while, in the area of health, we are lacking true political cooperation and leadership.”",News/Australia news,Emergency overload: how Covid exposed Australia’s straining hospital system,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/emergency-overload-how-covid-exposed-australias-straining-hospital-system
5/15/2022,"Mereana Richards has spent almost a decade providing warm beds, showers and hot meals to locals in Port Hedland – in Western Australia’s Pilbara region – who have had too much to drink. As the coordinator of a sobering-up service, run by an Indigenous-led not-for-profit, Richards runs the centre that is a safe haven for alcohol-affected locals. “Sometimes they are legless, sometimes they don’t want to listen or have a shower or do anything,” she says. “They can come in drunk and play up and use it as an excuse to not remember the rules.” The eight-bed centre in the town of about 14,000 people is run by the Bloodwood Tree Association. Bloodwood provides a range of accommodation, employment and alcohol treatment services to at-risk Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. But there are strict rules, including a requirement that people shower upon arrival, and a zero-tolerance approach to violent behaviour. “I just tell them if they don’t want to behave themselves, they can stay away,” says Richards, who has been assaulted three times at the centre. Sobering-up services are scattered across Western Australia – where public intoxication was decriminalised in 1990 as a result of the interim report of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody. The commission found the offence disproportionately affected Indigenous people. Decades later, Victoria and Queensland remain the only jurisdictions to still have a specific offence for public drunkenness. The Andrews government last year passed the landmark reform to decriminalise the offence – but has now pushed back the official repeal, citing Covid-related pressures on the health system that have caused a delay in establishing trial sobering-up centres. That reform was prompted by the high-profile death of 55-year-old Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day, who was arrested in December 2017 after being found drunk on a train travelling from Castlemaine to Melbourne. She later died in hospital from head injuries sustained in a prison holding cell. In Day’s case, police officers told a coronial inquiry she had been detained for her own protection and in order to sober up. The coroner found the welfare checks by the two officers responsible for her care were inadequate and did not comply with police guidelines. The coroner’s findings said Day’s death was “clearly preventable” had she not been arrested and placed in police custody – and recommended the state abolish the offence of public drunkenness. Victoria is now grappling with the transition to a new way to deal with the issue that diverts public intoxication from the criminal justice system and into the health sector. This will probably involve Aboriginal-controlled community organisations – working alongside alcohol, drug and other health services – being the alternative pathway for people found drunk in public. An expert group, commissioned by the government in the wake of Day’s death to make recommendations for reform, said Victorian police should only be able to detain an intoxicated person in “strictly limited circumstances” – and only be responsible for transporting them when there were no other available options. Feedback from a pilot program will help crystallise the wider rollout of a health-based response when the decriminalisation comes into effect, which Guardian Australia understands will be in November next year. The government will aim to establish the four trial sites – funded with an investment of $26.4m – by the middle of the year. In establishing a public health response, the Victorian government will be forced to find a compromise between the state’s powerful police union, which says police have a vital role to play in protecting the community from intoxication, and Indigenous advocacy groups. Indigenous groups argue police must take a back seat, pointing to numerous deaths in custody since the 1991 royal commission and the disproportionate impact policing has on their communities. The Police Association of Victoria previously warned that decriminalising public drunkenness before having a replacement system to deal with the issue was “dangerous virtue signalling”. Despite the government committing to establishing sobering-up centre trials, the union says the government’s approach to reform has “failed to deliver clarity to the community about the way that the reform will be implemented and how the community will be protected from alcohol-fuelled offending”. “Police remain entirely unsure about what tools they will be given to properly protect Victorians and deal with public drunkenness, of which 8,269 alleged incidents are recorded on average each year,” a union spokesperson said. The latest figures from the state’s crime statistics agency show there were 2,984 drunk and disorderly offences recorded last year. The Victorian Aboriginal Legal Service argues police should not be involved in a heath-based response or should have their involvement “heavily constrained”. “Aboriginal voices and health experts must lead the design of the health model,” VALS’s chief executive, Nerita Waight, tells Guardian Australia. “These reforms will make the community safer because people will get the health support they need. The reforms will particularly make Victoria safer for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who continue to be over-policed and over-incarcerated.” Balancing the police’s role in dealing with public intoxication is rarely clear cut. In Western Australia, despite decriminalisation, police have the power to apprehend someone intoxicated in public to protect them from themselves or others, or stop them from causing damage to property. In New South Wales, where “public drunkenness” was officially decriminalised in the late 1970s, it continues to be criminalised via police’s move-on powers, University of NSW law professor Luke McNamara argues. “Sometimes people treat the moment of formal decriminalisation as some kind of magic moment where the criminal justice system is no longer involved,” he says. “That is not actually an accurate story in terms of how we should understand the relationship between criminal law, police and public intoxication.” Intoxication-specific move-on powers for police were introduced in 2007 and expanded in 2011. Failure to comply with move-on orders is an offence that can lead to detainment. “It’s important to think about all the other ways in which the police might have capacity to engage their powers to address public intoxication, and to make sure that none of those are being used in a way which is inconsistent with the new, appropriate health-based response,” McNamara says. The health-based response will see health services like drug and alcohol treatment centres working alongside Aboriginal organisations. But while the Victorian Ambulance Union supports the reform, its general secretary, Danny Hill, says “a lot of work” is needed to ensure a health-based model does not strain a system that is already overburdened. A Victorian government spokesperson says local outreach teams would provide on-the-ground support for anyone affected by alcohol as part of the reform. “The new health model will promote therapeutic and culturally safe pathways to assist people who are drunk and will include outreach services and sobering-up services – making sure people are in a safe place where they can receive appropriate support,” the spokesperson says. In Port Hedland, Richards credits the local police and ambulance services, who work with Bloodwood’s service, in providing support to the local community – relationships she admits are easier to maintain in a small town. “The beauty of it is because we are all normally serving the same people, it’s like one big circle. They go from one service to the other. We’re all trying to help them,” Richards says.",News/Australia news,From lock-up to sobering up: Victoria grapples with public drunkenness reform,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/15/from-lock-up-to-sobering-up-victoria-grapples-with-public-drunkenness-reform

5/15/2022,"Labour rising star Wes Streeting has denied preparing a leadership bid to replace Keir Starmer after it emerged that the wealthy party donor Waheed Alli hosted a recent fundraising event for him and another MP at his central London home.

Some senior figures in the party, who do not favour Streeting as a future leader, say the shadow health secretary has been “on manoeuvres” for months, readying himself in case Starmer leaves his post before or after the next election. Rumours about the activities of possible replacements to Starmer began swirling round Westminster last week after the Labour leader announced he would resign if fined by Durham police for drinking a beer and eating curry in an MP’s office after a day of campaigning for the local elections in April 2021. While Starmer is confident he will be cleared, having received four different legal opinions on the case, his pledge to quit if fined has inevitably started several hares running on the subject of a possible succession battle. Others thought likely to run if Starmer has to quit include the shadow levelling up secretary, Lisa Nandy, and the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said last week that he had not given up hopes of leading the party, though this would not be in the near future; first he would need to be selected and then elected to a Labour seat in the Commons. Burnham made clear last week in an interview with LBC that were a future opportunity to arise, and the party wanted him, he would relish tackling the levelling up agenda and reforming the way the country is governed. Streeting’s office vehemently denied that the event at Alli’s house had anything to do with leadership ambitions and said it was merely to raise funds for constituency campaigning. A spokesman for Streeting accused people in the party of stirring up mischief, saying: “This was a joint fundraiser with Kim Leadbeater to support her campaigning in Batley & Spen and to support Wes’s campaigning in Ilford North and as shadow health secretary. Keir’s office were fully aware of the event, which was held months ago. Whoever briefed this nonsense should put their wooden spoon away.” Streeting, who grew up in a council flat in Stepney, east London, and funded his way through Cambridge University by doing shifts during his holidays in the customer service department at Comet, has been the MP for Ilford North since 2015. He is now widely regarded as one of Labour’s most effective communicators. His allies point out that he has been one of the Labour leader’s most consistent advocates and defenders. Aged just 39, he is on the right of the party and was heavily critical of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership. Peter Kyle, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary and an ally of Streeting, said such events were normal and set up as a way to allow MPs to pay for extra staff whose salaries could not be met from party funds. “I can put my hand on my heart and say this had nothing whatsoever to do with any leadership shenanigans,” said Kyle. Alli has been a long-term donor since he was first brought into the New Labour inner circle under Tony Blair and has funded the campaigns of successive leadership candidates, including David Miliband and Starmer himself. He gave £100,000 to Starmer’s campaign, which led to his election in April 2020. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows that the so-called Beergate affair had led to a 10% fall in Starmer’s personal ratings over recent weeks. Despite this, Starmer is still regarded more favourably than Boris Johnson on issues relating to Partygate and Beergate. Nine out of ten (89%) think that Johnson broke the rules during the pandemic, with 63% thinking he did so intentionally. For Starmer, 58% think he broke the rules, with 30% thinking he did so intentionally. Two-thirds of respondents (65%) think he was right to say he would resign if he received a fixed penalty notice. Adam Drummond, head of political and social research at Opinium, said: “A media focus on Beergate was never going to be the best talking point for the Labour leader after the local elections, and this is reflected in the hit to his net approval ratings that now sit at -10. “Nevertheless, voters are much more likely to give Keir Starmer the benefit of the doubt that he acted appropriately than the prime minister, while almost a quarter have actually gained a more favourable view of him for the way he has responded to the accusations, by promising to resign if he is fined by the police.”",News/Politics,Labour heavyweight Wes Streeting denies plan to succeed Starmer,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/14/labour-heavyweight-wes-streeting-denies-plan-to-succeed-starmer
5/15/2022,"Edouard Mendy His kicking has been shaky this season and Liverpool were quick to pressure him. But Mendy responded with a crucial save from Luis Díaz. 6 Trevoh Chalobah The young defender had a torrid time against Díaz during the first 20 minutes. He deserves praise for continuing to battle. Liverpool stopped exposing him. 6 Thiago Silva The veteran made a goalline clearance early on and carried on after colliding with Chalobah. Silva stayed calm and did not put a foot wrong. 7 Antonio Rüdiger The German was desperate to go out on high before his move to Real Madrid. His defending did not disappoint. 7 Reece James Chelsea were more solid once James altered his positioning, gave Chalobah more protection and got closer to Díaz. His dangerous crossing also unnerved Liverpool’s defence. 7 Jorginho The Italy international wore the captain’s armband and his influence grew as the game progressed. But he could not help Chelsea keep possession long enough. 6 Mateo Kovacic He offered dynamism after making a quick recovery from an ankle injury, though an error almost proved costly. Was never going to last 90 minutes. 7 Marcos Alonso He lacks pace but had a reliable game. Alonso defended diligently and was a threat going forward. He even hit the woodwork with a free-kick. 7 Mason Mount He was lively at times. He created Chelsea’s firstchance. Could not quite find the killer touch and was devastated to miss inthe shootout. 6 Christian Pulisic The American winger had some decent moments. He made a chance for Alonso, went close from Mount’s cutback and tested Alisson. But he faded. 6 Romelu Lukaku Thomas Tuchel ripped into the striker after 15 minutes and demanded more movement. The message did not get through to the lethargic Lukaku. Unsurprisingly substituted. 4 Subs N’Golo Kanté The Frenchman was impressive after replacing Kovacic. 7 Hakim Ziyech The playmaker almost carved Liverpool open with a gorgeous cross. 6 Ruben Loftus-Cheek Went up front after replacing Pulisic – Timo Werner had tweaked a hamstring during the warm-up – and was mystified to be substituted 15 minutes later. 6 César Azpilicueta The defender replaced Chalobah during extra-time. 6 Ross Barkley Sent on instead of Werner for penalties. N/A Alisson He made vital saves and played on after shaking off a knock.He was there to make the decisive save from Mount in the shootout. 8 Trent Alexander-Arnold There was an amazing ball to release Díaz and some devilish crosses. He had a few unconvincing moments defensively but also made some important tackles. 7 Ibrahima Konaté The centre-back looks increasingly imposing. He won his headers and dominated Lukaku. But he was slightly lucky not to concede a penalty for a push. 7 Virgil van Dijk The Dutchman always seems to be in the right place. He was there to force Lukaku to fire over. His departure at the start of extra-time was a concern. 7 Andy Robertson Snapped into challenges and should have won it late on, only to hit the post from close range. He had more to think about when James began to push higher. 6 Jordan Henderson Fabinho’s absence meant the captain was the deepest of Liverpool’s midfield trio. He used possession intelligently and screened his defence. A typically unselfish display. 8 Thiago Alcântara The Spaniard was a controlling presence in the middle, although he was lucky to escape when Mount picked his pocket. Tired as the game wore on. 7 Naby Keïta The midfielder missed a chance to give Liverpool the lead, firing wide. He played some incisive passes but he could not complain about being substituted. 6 Mohamed Salah The Egyptian looked weary before limping off in the 33rd minute. Liverpool will be desperate to have him available for the Champions League final. 6 Sadio Mané There were plenty of threatening runs but Mane found it difficult to make an impact in the final third. He was not decisive enough when he had space. 6 Luis Díaz The winger had the beating of Chalobah during the early stages but his end product was lacking. He was menacing but Liverpool needed more ruthlessness. 7 Subs Diogo Jota The Portuguese forward missed two inviting chances after replacing Salah. 6 James Milner The midfielder’s fizzing cross should have been converted by Robertson. 6 Joël Matip The German replaced Van Dijk and slotted in comfortably. 6 Roberto Firmino The Brazilian replaced Díaz during extra-time. 6 Kostas Tsimikas The left-back wrote himself into Liverpool folklore by scoring the winning penalty. 7",Sport/Football,Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool (5-6 pen): FA Cup final player ratings from Wembley,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/14/chelsea-0-0-liverpool-5-6-pen-fa-cup-final-player-ratings-from-wembley
