3/4/2022,"MARIUPOL, Ukraine (AP) — The surgeons leaving the operating room don’t make eye contact. One of them holds up his hands. Another looks down, defeated. It’s then that the father waiting at the doorway grabs his forehead, tears welling, and turns away, a wail about to escape his throat. The man, identified only as Serhii, enters the room and finds his 16-year-old son, Iliya, is still and draped by a blood-stained sheet. Serhii drops down, hugs Iliya's lifeless head and convulses with grief. Iliya was fatally wounded Wednesday while playing soccer in Mariupol when shelling started amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The explosive hit the soccer field near a school in the Azov Sea city. Elsewhere in Mariupol, shelling illuminated darkening skies as medics stood in a parking lot, with heavy fighting continuing on the city outskirts on Thursday. The city was plunged into darkness as the battle knocked out most phone services and raised the prospect of food and water shortages. Without phone connections, medics did not know where to take the wounded. Others drove around the city, with one crew finding a wounded woman who was put on a stretcher, carried down the stairs and placed into an ambulance, her hands shaking rapidly. Cutting off Ukraine’s access to the Black and Azov Seas would deal a crippling blow to Ukraine’s economy. It would also allow Russia to build a land corridor to Crimea, which it seized in 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have brought their superior firepower to bear over the past few days, launching hundreds of missiles and artillery attacks on cities and other sites around the country and making significant gains in the south. The Russians announced the capture of the southern city of Kherson, a vital Black Sea port of 280,000, and local Ukrainian officials confirmed the takeover of the government headquarters there, making it the first major city to fall since the invasion began a week ago.",World/Associated Press,Father mourns son after shelling on Ukraine soccer field,https://news.yahoo.com/father-mourns-son-shelling-ukraine-010750912.html
3/4/2022,"The mega-mansion known as ""The One"" sold Thursday for $126 million at a bankruptcy auction. That's a huge discount from its $295-million listing price, even with a 12% auction fee bringing the total to about $141 million. The Bel-Air property set a record for the costliest house sold at auction, but it fell well short of the California sales record set by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, who purchased a Malibu estate for $177 million in October. The most ever spent on a U.S. residence was $238 million by hedge fund mogul Ken Griffin for a New York City penthouse in 2019. Several international sales have surpassed $300 million. The buyer will be disclosed by March 8, when paperwork must be submitted to U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Deborah Saltzman, who will hold a hearing later this month on whether to approve the sale. It is possible that the winning bidder will be a limited liability company, a legal entity often used by the wealthy to hide their real estate purchases. At least three dozen prospective buyers toured the 944 Airole Way property over the last couple of months, including billionaires from the Middle East, Asia and in California, The One's listing agents have said. The online auction opened Monday, with just a handful of participants bidding before the final gavel. Most of the action occurred in the last few minutes. The price amounted to well less than the roughly $190 million in debt carried by the property, meaning that many creditors will take losses. The largest single creditor is Los Angeles billionaire Don Hankey, who lent $106 million to the dream project of developer Nile Niami. The lender claims he is owed more than $130 million in secured debt, including money he provided in bankruptcy to repair and spiff up the property for sale. Hankey, who previously said he might bid for the property if it was severely underpriced at the auction, said he did not make an offer. He said the sale should allow him to recover the cash he put into the project, but added that he was surprised at how low the final price was. ""The guy who bought it just got a great deal. He's got people willing to pay $50,000 a day just to do commercials and films,"" Hankey said. The hilltop home, said to be 105,000 square feet, was marketed for $500 million several years ago while under construction but didn't find a buyer. It was placed into bankruptcy in October after Hankey foreclosed on the $106 million in debt defaulted on by Crestlloyd, the limited liability company established by Niami that legally owns the project. Turnaround specialist Lawrence Perkins, who was put in charge of Crestlloyd when the home was placed into bankruptcy, said the ""market spoke"" at the auction price. However, he also said it was his responsibility to continue fielding late offers that might top the auction price. ""I've got an obligation if someone comes in, and there's a better offer. We're not soliciting them but it's not closed until it's closed,"" he said. ""Some people don't want to participate in auctions."" Broker Stephen Shapiro, the founding partner of Westside Estate Agency, said that low price reflected the ""out-of-control ego"" of Niami, who built a huge house that wasn't really a home. ""Most builders build a house that people can live in,"" he said. ""He built one thinking there was going to be demand for this outrageous over-the-top house."" Niami has been attempting to regain control of the property. In December, he proposed creating a cryptocurrency called The One Coin that would be backed by the mansion and pay off all the home’s debts. Prior to the auction, a Niami spokesperson said the developer would not be commenting on the auction. He could not be reached for immediate comment Thursday. The One is just the latest L.A. trophy home to end up in bankruptcy following a blitz of costly development in the region's glitzy hillsides and coastal communities. Concierge Auctions, a luxury online auction house that handled The One's sale, last year set an auction record when it sold a Beverly Park home for $51 million — but that was still more than $100 million off its original asking price. How much The One would go for has been something of a parlor game in the luxury real estate community, with some thinking it is the ultimate trophy home and others declaring it a white elephant. The property includes a 4,000-square-foot guesthouse, a sky deck with cabanas, a private theater, a full-service spa, a nightclub and even an outdoor running track and moat. It has 21 bedrooms and 42 full bathrooms. However, the mansion could end up being a project for the buyer. The house isn’t 100% complete and lacks a certificate of occupancy, pending a sign-off from city inspectors on crucial permits for grading, electrical and other work. Also, it could have construction defects and zoning code violations, according to allegations in court documents. The mansion was described on the Concierge website as the “largest in the urban world,” but by many accounts, a 27-story home said to be 400,000 square feet owned by a billionaire in Mumbai, India, is considered the world’s largest, outside of royal palaces. However, it may be the largest in the country. Under the terms of the auction agreement, the winning bidder is under legal obligation to close the sale by the end of the month or lose a $250,000 deposit. In making her determination whether to approve the deal, the judge will consider whether she believes the high bidder has the financial wherewithal to close the sale, its impact on creditors and other issues. The second-largest secured creditor is Inferno Investment, a company run by Julien Remillard, a longtime Canadian investor of Niami's. Inferno Investment claims it is owed $24 million. The third largest, at $14 million, is Yogi Securities, the investment vehicle of Joseph Englanoff, an L.A. doctor and another longtime Niami investor. The remaining secured and unsecured claims are substantially smaller. Compass agent Bret Parson said that he thought the price more reflected the value of the hilltop property, with its commanding views across the city, than the house itself. ""It's unfortunate that Mother Nature's valuable resources can be plundered for ridiculous trophies,"" he said. — Times writer Jack Flemming contributed to this report.

3/4/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - As Russian troops slowly advanced on Ukraine's capital Kyiv on Thursday, some people back in Moscow were attempting to flee to destinations abroad that have not banned flights from Russia, stomaching soaring prices in the rush to escape. The Kremlin dismissed speculation that Russian authorities plan to introduce martial law following the invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"", or that they will stop men of fighting age leaving Russia, but some did not want to risk staying. One Russian man, who moved back to Moscow from western Europe around a year ago, said he had bought a flight to Istanbul for the weekend, adding that living in Moscow may no longer be possible. ""I'm afraid that mobilisation will be introduced tomorrow and I won't be able to fly out,"" said the 29-year-old, requesting anonymity like others cited in this article. ""In my worst nightmares I couldn't have dreamt of such hell when I was coming back a year ago."" Another man, aged 38, said he had managed to buy an expensive ticket to fly to the Middle East at the weekend. ""I don't want to fight in this war. We've heard lots of rumours and I don't trust the Kremlin when it says they aren't true,"" he said. Russia's invasion of Ukraine entered its second week on Thursday with Ukrainian cities surrounded and under bombardment. Hundreds of Russian soldiers and Ukrainian civilians have been killed and Russia has been plunged into an isolation never before experienced by an economy of such size. FEARING ARREST The cost of plane tickets has leapt since Russia closed its airspace to airlines from the European Union and many other countries in a tit-for-tat response to sanctions imposed by the West, severely limiting Russians' ability to travel. The unprecedented Western sanctions on Moscow have already sent prices rising and started hitting the lives of ordinary Russians, while those who protest have been swiftly arrested. Some 7,669 people have been detained at anti-war protests since the invasion began on Feb. 24, according to the OVD-Info protest-monitoring group. After giving her cat to her family to look after, a 29-year-old woman flew to Israel on Sunday before prices rose even further, worried that things in Moscow can only get worse. ""I am ashamed that I haven't stayed in Russia, that I am not fighting to the end, not protesting in the streets,"" she said. ""But if you go out against the war, they arrest you, and there is this law on state treason."" Russia's state prosecutor's office on Feb. 27 issued a reminder that anyone providing financial or other assistance to a foreign state or international organisation aimed against Russia's security could be convicted of treason and face a maximum sentence of 20 years. VISA PROBLEMS Others faced bureaucratic hurdles. Russians require visas to enter most European countries, and a modest queue had formed at the Italian visa application centre in Moscow, which was still accepting requests by appointment only, with the nearest available slots over a week away. ""I will make an appointment for March 11, although what may happen in the near future is scary and uncertain,"" said one 40-year-old Russian woman. ""I want to have a visa ready. I think they will let me in with a PCR test (against COVID) and then I'll sort something out,"" she added. Russia's Sputnik V vaccine has not been approved by the EU, meaning many Russians without a shot recognised in the West may be denied entry on health grounds. It was not just Russians trying to flee. A Filipino woman who works as a nanny in Moscow was also applying for a visa. ""I desperately want to get a visa, I'm scared here,"" she said.

 The Biden administration is weighing whether to impose sanctions against India over its stockpile of and reliance on Russian military equipment as part of the wide-ranging consequences the West is seeking to impose on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine. Donald Lu, the assistant secretary of State for South Asian affairs, on Thursday told lawmakers in a hearing that the administration is weighing how threatening India's historically close military relationship with Russia is to U.S. security. ""It's a question we're looking at very closely, as the administration is looking at the broader question over whether to apply sanctions under CAATSA or to waive those sanctions,"" Lu said. The Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, passed in 2017 in the wake of the Kremlin's interference in U.S. elections, includes the authority to sanction transactions with Russian defense or intelligence sectors. The law includes waiver authority for the president that was used for Turkey, an ally in NATO, until December 2020 when the Trump administration imposed sanctions under the law for Ankara's purchase of the Russian S400 missile defense system. In 2016, India was named a ""Major Defense Partner"" with the U.S., a unique designation that serves to elevate defense trade and technology. Defense contracts between the U.S. and India are said to have amounted to $20 billion since 2008. India is also a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue with the U.S., Japan and Australia, a grouping that focuses on countering China's ambitions in the Indo-Pacific. President Biden held a video call with Quad leaders on Thursday, according to the White House, ""to discuss the war against Ukraine and its implications for the Indo-Pacific."" Lu told lawmakers that the administration is ""in the process of trying to understand whether defense technology that we are sharing with India today can be adequately safeguarded given India's historical relationship with Russia and its defense sales."" ""It is critical that with any partner, that the United States is able to assure itself that any defense technology we share is sufficiently protected,"" he said. Lu said the administration has been engaged in a ""pitched battle"" with Indian officials over the past couple of months leading up to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. President Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and other senior officials in the State Department urged New Delhi to ""to take a clearer position, a position opposed to Russia's action."" The secretary said India's abstention at the United Nations and its commitment to provide Ukraine with humanitarian assistance are promising steps in a shift in its public position and that he expects an even greater shift in the aftermath of outrage at the death of an Indian student killed in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, by Russian bombing in recent days. ""I have had several conversations with Indian officials in the last 24 hours,"" Lu said. ""What we can see, already, very quickly is that action has begun to turn public opinion in India against a country that they perceived as a partner, undeniably, that partner has killed a young person who was an innocent victim in Ukraine.""",World/The Hill,Biden weighing sanctions on India over Russian military stockpiles,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-weighing-sanctions-india-over-153006771.html
