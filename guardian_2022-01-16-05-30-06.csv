1/16/2022,"Tory MPs will be ready in sufficient numbers to force Boris Johnson out of Downing Street within weeks if he tries to dodge responsibility for rule-breaking parties at No 10, the Observer has been told. While most Conservative MPs say they are waiting for a report into so-called “partygate” by the senior civil servant Sue Gray before deciding the prime minister’s fate, large numbers admit privately that their minds are effectively made up and that they are merely observing “due process”.  What has convinced many Tory MPs to act against Johnson if he or the Downing Street operation is criticised directly or indirectly by Gray – and he then tries to fight on – has been the furious reaction from their constituents to new revelations of partying, including two events late into the night at No 10, on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral last April when such gatherings were forbidden. An Opinium poll for the Observer will spread further alarm in Conservative ranks. It shows Labour taking a 10-point lead over the Tories, with Johnson’s personal ratings collapsing to levels equivalent to Theresa May at her lowest ebb. It also shows that 46% of Leave voters who backed the Conservatives at the 2019 election say Johnson should resign, suggesting the coalition he put together to win an 80-strong majority in parliament is fracturing. The Tory MP Tobias Ellwood, a former foreign office minister, said that Johnson had to demonstrate within days that he could end the chaos for good and demonstrate a new kind of leadership. “But if he tries to spin his way out of a critical report, he will lose my support,” he said. So far only a handful of Tory MPs have called publicly for Johnson to go. To trigger a vote of confidence in him, 54 MPs or more need to write to the chair of the influential 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers asking for one. If Johnson were to lose such a vote, he has to step down. Another senior figure in the party said MPs were in a holding pattern. The Tory MP for Waveney in Suffolk, Peter Aldous, said he was close to calling for Johnson’s head though he would wait for the Gray report, adding that many pro-Brexit voters in his constituency were among those who were outraged at what had been going on. “An awful lot people who voted Brexit do feel very badly let down,” he said, pointing out that this was not because of the effects of Brexit but because of Johnson’s personal behaviour. Another Tory MP said that he had been confronted by local Tory councillors on Friday who had voted for Johnson as leader and backed Brexit before voting Conservative in 2019, but were now insisting en masse that Johnson had to go. “I can say my councillors are very pissed off,” he said. A senior Whitehall figure in regular touch with Gray, who is expected to publish her findings by the end of this week, said she was “disappointed in what she is finding but personally she is robust”. It is understood she had no idea of the latest revelations about parties and only found about them in the media. The source added that Gray had her reputation for independence and integrity to protect but was also studiously fair. “She will give it both barrels to whoever deserves it, whether that is a special adviser or civil servant or the politicos. “We will get the unvarnished truth. If she sees direct responsibility, she will be clear. That is why I think this is going to be uncomfortable for everyone. Everyone is going to take their share of the blame.” Professor Robert Ford of Manchester University said the Opinium poll should be seriously worrying for the Tories and Johnson. “Johnson himself has shifted from the party’s biggest asset, with a Brexit-fuelled appeal separate to the Conservative brand, to its biggest liability, as the revelations of Downing Street revelry in lockdown render him personally toxic with the same voters. “The Conservatives may now be damned if they do and damned if they don’t. Sticking with Johnson risks further contaminating the party brand if the scandals continue and voter fury intensifies.” Separately, a panel of Tory activists assembled by the ConservativeHome website found 53% believed Johnson should resign immediately. The former Tory MP and editor of the website, Paul Goodman, said: “That over half of party members want the prime minister out, if this return is representative, is a humiliating result for him, and shows a loss of confidence that may not be reversed.” Opinium put Labour on 41%, the Tories on 31%, the Lib Dems on 9% and the Greens on 6%. On the partygate scandal, 78% of voters think that Downing Street staff did break lockdown rules, against 8% who say they did not. Some 76% think Johnson himself broke lockdown rules, against 8% who believe he did not. Just 13% think Johnson is telling the truth about what happened, against 64% who do not. Some 67% believe the police should investigate what happened.",News/Politics,Tories will oust Boris Johnson if he tries to dodge ‘partygate’ blame,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/15/tories-will-oust-boris-johnson-if-he-tries-to-dodge-partygate-blame
1/16/2022,"Janny Sikazwe made a mistake and ended up blowing for full time after 85 minutes of Wednesday’s Africa Cup of Nations meeting between Mali and Tunisia. Forgetting to stop the watch during a water break (if that is what happened) is an understandable error – particularly given he was subsequently taken to hospital suffering from heatstroke – and one that could easily have been rectified. As it was, though, Sikazwe, an experienced referee who took charge of the 2017 Cup of Nations final as well as Belgium v Panama and Japan v Poland at the 2018 World Cup, looked rattled. He sent off Mali’s El Bilal Touré for an innocuous foul, sticking with his original decision even after VAR asked him to review it, and then blew for full time again after 89 minutes and 47 seconds. Tunisia then refused an attempt to restart the game half an hour later, and it remains to be seen what the fallout will be.  Much of the discussion has centred on how embarrassing the incident was for the tournament (very, not because European referees haven’t also made mistakes in high-profile games, but because it confirms the negative impression many already have of the Cup of Nations), but it also raises wider issues about refereeing: the issue was less Sikazwe’s mistake than his reaction to it. Imagine he had seen the surprise of the players at the game being stopped, checked with the fourth official, reset the watch, apologised and moved on with some combination of clarity and humility. It might have taken a minute, but essentially it would have been a quickly forgotten oddity. Instead he failed properly to reset the time and it is hard to believe his flustered state (which may have been in part the result of his heatstroke) didn’t contribute to the red card. Refereeing is not just about getting decisions right, but also about the projection of authority – which doesn’t necessarily mean being dictatorial; it means persuading the players you’re in control and doing your best. The thought occurred also during Manchester City’s win at Arsenal, when Stuart Attwell found himself widely condemned for getting a series of decisions right. Ederson’s foul on Martin Ødegaard was apparent only from one camera angle; Attwell can hardly be blamed for not seeing it, and it was equally understandable that VAR should not deem that a clear and obvious error. Gabriel deserved both his yellow cards, while the only way Attwell could have avoided giving a penalty for Granit Xhaka’s shirt pull on Bernardo Silva would have been to penalise Bernardo for simulation, but given he was going down having fallen over Xhaka’s leg that would have been absurd. But part of the issue was that Attwell simply looks so beleaguered. Attitude matters. Pierluigi Collina or the similarly wild-eyed Gambian official Bakary Gassama he is not. Rather Attwell gives off the air of a hen-pecked husband struggling to make the payments on the over-fancy car he was persuaded to buy. Add images of him looking stressed to television’s insistence his decisions were controversial – a debate largely generated by its own coverage – and the result was furore. That scrutiny is another major part of the problem, undermining any attitude of control. The way decisions are analysed creates controversy and doubt, particularly when there is rarely any acknowledgement that some decisions are almost impossible to make at speed from a single angle, or that in some cases there probably is no definitive “right” answer. That has created a community of snitches and zealots, constantly peering through the net curtain, determined to find faults to punish. With every nudge on a shoulder, every brush of ball on arm, the question has become not: “Was there an attempt to cheat?” but: “Can we penalise this?” Rather than asking if there was a foul, we ask whether there was contact. Having arms has become a defender’s original sin. The Premier League is far from perfect but it at least seems to have come up with a workable definition of handball so that the arms have to be carelessly extended from the body for a penalty to be given. Other leagues and the Cup of Nations are working on strict liability: the penalties given against Mali, Tunisia and Zimbabwe in their first fixtures all involved balls being hammered into arms from relatively close range. Perhaps Zimbabwe’s Kelvin Wilbert’s arm was slightly extended from his body as he hurled himself into the path of the ball but is the game really better if defenders are discouraged from attempting blocks like that? If matches are going to be decided on such moments of randomness, then for all the football merit involved we may as well hide gold rings randomly round the pitch and award a goal for every one found. Similarly, an over-literal interpretation of the offside law now means a player trying to intercept a pass can play onside a forward who was offside when the pass he is trying to stop was played. It happened for Joe Ironside’s goal for Cambridge against Newcastle and it happened for Kylian Mbappé for France against Spain in the Nations League final. Clearly that is absurd: what sense does it make that a goal stands if the pass brushes the defender’s foot but not if he misses it entirely? That’s not how the law was ever meant to be applied. As with handball at the Cup of Nations, there has been an inversion, as though the laws, rather than shaping and controlling a game that predates them, have become a sacred text from which the game derives. Since David Elleray became technical director for the law-making International Football Association Board, a puritanical fundamentalism has taken hold. And that is not just bad for the shape and rhythm and basic fairness of the game; it’s bad for referees, undermining and dehumanising them. When the law is so cold and so inflexible, it makes errors such as Sikazwe’s far harder to tolerate, makes it far harder for referees to build the consent that lends them authority.",Sport/Football,"When football’s laws are so inflexible, referees’ gaffes are harder to swallow | Jonathan Wilson",https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/15/football-laws-referees-janny-sikazwe-stuart-attwell
1/16/2022,"At least you could actually see the teams from the stands this time, unlike in the fog-bound reverse fixture at Scotstoun last month. It was also infinitely prettier viewing for Exeter’s supporters who can now confidently anticipate their side featuring in the last 16 of the Champions Cup after this ultimately thumping eight-try victory. With a hat-trick for Tom O’Flaherty, a brace for the prolific Sam Simmonds, and Luke Cowan-Dickie, Jack Nowell and Dave Ewers also on the scoresheet, the previously dogged Warriors were blown away by 38 points in 26 second-half minutes as Exeter found the extra gear that had previously eluded them. Glasgow could still potentially make it through but only if they defeat La Rochelle at home next Saturday.  It was also an instructive night for the England coaching staff who had travelled en masse to Devon. In theory they were running the rule over Nowell, Simmonds, Cowan-Dickie, Henry Slade and maybe even Ewers and Jack Maunder, but mostly they were scouting the opposition, who fielded a good sprinkling of the Scotland side set to feature in next month’s Calcutta Cup encounter. At least half of this Glasgow starting XV stand a decent chance of facing England at Murrayfield and Eddie Jones, Richard Cockerill, Martin Gleeson and Matt Proudfoot clearly felt there was tactical mileage to be had in studying one or two individuals. As it turned out, the most eye-catching Scottish presence was probably the young flanker Rory Darge, who is unlikely to dislodge Hamish Watson or Jamie Ritchie from the starting back row. Last time Exeter entertained Glasgow in this competition it ended in a 42-0 thrashing. On this occasion, though, the home pack were lacking the injured Jonny Hill, Jonny Gray and Harry Williams and the suspended Alec Hepburn and, from a visiting perspective, were potentially not as bulletproof as usual. Exeter did not start particularly well, having been led out by the ever-reliable Ewers, playing his 200th game for the club. Glasgow initially looked the livelier side and deservedly took an early lead through a penalty from the outside-half Ross Thompson. Exeter needed something to kickstart some momentum and finally found it when a slickly executed first-phase backline move put the nippy O’Flaherty over for his first. With Glasgow brows still furrowed, Exeter scored again with Sam Simmonds proving impossible to stop from close range. Suddenly it was 14-3 and, not unlike the visiting fans who had their bagpipes confiscated as they entered the stadium, Glasgow had to revisit their carefully laid plans. It was a welcome bonus, then, when the lock Kiran McDonald forced his way over for his first European try and the 21-year-old Darge further enhanced his reputation with a fine ruck turnover at the expense of his national captain, Stuart Hogg. The interval scoreline of 14-10 was a pretty fair reflection of a stop-start first 40 minutes on an unusually still January evening. But this Glasgow side are clearly not daunted by the scoreboard. Upfield they surged and a clever flat cut-out pass from Ali Price put Matt Fagerson into enough space to storm impressively to the line. Now it was a proper European ding-dong, with Slade enjoying a slice of luck when his overhit kick to the corner was touched in flight by Cole Forbes to give Exeter another useful platform. After Ewers had been held up initially, Simmonds drove over for his second to regain the lead and the conversion from his brother, Joe, compounded visiting frustration. The rest was as clearcut as the reverse fixture was famously murky. O’Flaherty has a knack of scoring tries in big games and his hat-trick deservedly won the winger the man of the match award. The energetic Simmonds looked in very decent pre-Six Nations nick and Nowell’s improving fitness was also noticeable. The fit-again England winger scooted over for a deserved final try, Exeter’s sixth of the second half, and, with Jones due to announce England’s Six Nations squad on Tuesday, is looking slimmer and purposeful. On this occasion at least it was the Scots who have to head homewards to think again.",Sport/Sport,Tom O’Flaherty’s hat-trick inspires Exeter to thumping win over Glasgow,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/15/exeter-glasgow-european-champions-cup-rugby-union-match-report
1/16/2022,"Aston Villa’s comeback here pulsated and was decorated by Philippe Coutinho’s first Premier League goal – the 82nd-minute equaliser – since Boxing Day 2017. Manchester United should be furious at how they allowed the strike five minutes after Jacob Ramsey’s finish gave Steven Gerrard’s team a lifeline, Diogo Dalot, Victor Lindelöf and Raphaël Varane, all caught ball-watching.  Before this a delighted travelling United support had regaled Bruno Fernandes, their adored hero whose two finishes seemed to point to an invaluable victory in what was the captain’s best display of the campaign. Yet this underlines how off-colour Fernandes has been, one of too many United players. The visitors did, of course, not lose but this was a concerning surrender from Ralf Rangnick’s still-too-shaky side. United enjoyed the best start. Five minutes had been played when Alex Telles and Fernandes executed a slick free-kick on the left in which the former touched the ball to the latter who, striding forward, blazed at Emiliano Martínez. The goalkeeper fumbled – badly – and in rolled the opener. This followed two Fernandes corners so a team who lost their last league outing – to Wolves – and have struggled to establish patterns of play, will have hoped he goal might settle them. But Fred, in the lackadaisical manner that lets him down, miscontrolled near United’s area and Danny Ings nearly pounced. Cristiano Ronaldo was missing for a second consecutive outing due to a “hip flexor” problem, Rangnick said, while Marcus Rashford’s “dead leg” ruled him, so the German turned to Anthony Elanga, rather than Jadon Sancho in what was a 4-2-3-1, not the usual 4-2-2-2. The 19-year-old, operating on the left, lacked conviction with a header but better was the thrust of Mason Greenwood, one barracking run sweeping United forward, though his vision was not matched when passing and demanding a return. The No 11 is a predator, as Martínez discovered when a Telles cross came to him and the No 1 scrambled to save. Gerrard named one new signing – Lucas Digne – in the starting lineup, and another – Coutinho – as a substitute. His was a frustrating watch from the technical area, given how Villa conceded, so there was relief when, after Digne felled Dalot and Telles this time fired the free-kick at Martínez, the keeper kept the ball out. Gerrard’s side were suffering due to a far better display from United than in Monday’s encounter when Villa were seriously unlucky to suffer FA Cup elimination. It meant Villa were toothless until 31 minutes passed and Ollie Watkins, finally, tested David de Gea. United’s upturn might be traced to a Fernandes far more influential than in recent matches. A theory runs that he can be stifled by Ronaldo though they occupy different spaces and roles. The way he dropped deep to hit a Dalot run along the right was Fernandes in whirring, effervescent mode, the quality here contrasted to how, moments later, Fred belted a pass into touch. Before this Digne’s corner was headed goal-ward by Emiliano Buendía and De Gea’s reflexes protected United’s lead. Then the Spaniard’s knees saved Digne’s point-blank attempt. Fernandes crashed into Morgan Sanson as welcome to the second half, then the bright Elanga had Martínez beating a shot out. United lacked fluidity, maybe, but were a half a yard faster and closer to the opponent than in recent matches. Villa’s Ramsey had De Gea saving low to his right, this was followed up by Digne’s break, the ball swung over and rolled back to Matthew Cash, but the full-back failed to unload a shot. There was a flow to the contest that made invigorating entertainment in an under-the-lights atmosphere that crackled. Villa supporters were close to rapture when Buendía let fly but De Gea gathered and Digne hit side-netting. United were hemmed in, relief coming when they broke, Greenwood claimed a corner and Fernandes’s delivery eventually saw Elanga shooting wide. Rangnick clutched his head when Greenwood beat Martínez but the ball rolled marginally outside the right post. The 63-year-old was happier when Fernandes did beat the keeper, Fred’s assist a simple touch that allowed the team talisman to smash home. Yet now Coutinho, on after 68 minutes, created Ramsey’s strike, who beat De Gea after the Brazilian’s pass pin-balled off Fred. Next, Villa Park was lit up by the little magician, whose equaliser benefitted from a comedy of United defensive errors. Donny van de Beek might have grabbed glory with a late chance but failed.",Sport/Football,Philippe Coutinho inspires Aston Villa fightback against Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/aston-villa-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report
