4/7/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the commonwealth will co-fund a $741m natural disaster resilience package for flood-prone Queensland communities – just a day after rejecting the request and claiming it was not his government’s responsibility. Morrison made the about-face during an interview with Brisbane radio station 4BC on Thursday morning. It followed fierce criticism of the Morrison government on Wednesday, including from the Insurance Council of Australia, which said the federal government could not “wash its hands” of responsibility. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, wrote to Morrison on 19 March asking to go halves in the package, designed to pay for retrofitting, house raising or the voluntary buyback of flood-damaged homes. Morrison wrote to Palaszczuk on Tuesday night rejecting the request. He said in his letter that the measures were “outside the scope” of federal disaster recovery programs and the responsibility of state and local governments. When asked about the situation on Thursday morning, Morrison said the federal government had already committed more money to flood recovery than the Queensland government and that the requests made “go well beyond” others for “floods of this nature”. He said the federal government would now pay for half the resilience package. “If Queensland wants to play politics with floods before an election, that’s up to them,” Morrison said. “I don’t want to play politics with this, I just want to make sure people get the help they need. “Yes, we will provide that support. Yes, it is beyond the scope of what is normally done.” Morrison said the federal government would attach “conditions” to the payment that demanded Queensland be “transparent with the payments being made … I want them to report to the public”. The Queensland government was sitting on $52m provided for previous disaster recovery, the prime minister said. Guardian Australia is seeking to verify this claim. On Wednesday, the Insurance Council of Australia released a statement that criticised the federal government’s decision not to help fund the resilience package. In February, the ICA released a report calling for $726m to be invested jointly by the Queensland and federal governments over five years. It had welcomed the resilience funding when it was announced by the Queensland government. “As severe rain and flooding continues to impact the east coast, the failure of the federal government to match Queensland’s investment in measures to improve household and community protections against extreme weather is disappointing and short-sighted,” the ICA’s chief executive, Andrew Hall, said. “If Australia is to get serious about improving our resilience to flood, bushfire and cyclone, all levels of government must contribute. “Australians – particularly those still impacted by the ongoing rain and flooding – want governments to come together to provide better protections against worsening extreme weather, not wash their hands of responsibility.” The government’s initial rejection prompted an angry statement from the Queensland treasurer and acting premier, Cameron Dick, who said on Wednesday that Morrison’s response effectively said “it’s not his problem”. “Every Queenslander needs to know that this letter shows that Scott Morrison does not care about flood victims who need help from all levels of government,” Dick said. “It doesn’t matter if your home floods two, three or four times over, Scott Morrison wants no part in creating an ongoing solution. “Every expert report, including his own royal commission into natural disasters, says that the federal government should be funding disaster resilience, but this prime minister will not take responsibility and do his job to fund it.”",News/Australia news,Scott Morrison caves in to co-funding Queensland flood resilience package after fierce criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/07/scott-morrison-caves-in-to-co-funding-queensland-flood-resilience-package-after-fierce-criticism
