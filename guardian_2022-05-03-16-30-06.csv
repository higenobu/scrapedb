5/3/2022,"The Giro d’Italia begins on Friday and Vincenzo Nibali is not going to win it. We should probably be clear about that at the outset. Nibali has won it twice before, in 2013 and 2016, but that was a younger and hungrier man. Now he is 37, has not won a race of any real repute in three years and missed a big chunk of training time after catching Covid earlier in the year. When Nibali says his main goals are to ride for his Astana-Qazaqstan teammate Miguel Ángel López and hopefully pick up a couple of stages, he is not bluffing. And yet one is reminded of something else Nibali said a few years back, when he was on top of the world and the Italian press and public were demanding why he was not winning more. Nibali could have explained in painstaking detail the hundreds of little victories and minuscule alignments that have to go your way before you can even think about winning a bike race, or the unique difficulties of prevailing when the entire peloton has put a target on your back. Instead he simply said: “To be beaten is not the same as failing.” Perhaps no sport imparts that lesson more beautifully than cycling, a sport of teamwork and selfless sacrifices, of daring attacks and doomed heroism, where the first person over the line is often the most incidental detail of all. As he approaches what may well be his final Grand Tour on home soil, few riders have embodied that maxim quite like Nibali, a man who for all he has won over the years – all three Grand Tours, 15 stages, two Giri di Lombardia, Milan-San Remo – will be remembered above all for the way he made people feel. This year the Giro will return to Sicily and Nibali’s home town of Messina. For all Italy’s pedigree in the sport, Sicily has never really been cycling territory. Indeed, so limited were the opportunities when Nibali was growing up there that, at 14, he was obliged to leave home and move to Tuscany to try to make it as a pro rider. And so these familiar roads and slopes have a dual meaning to him now: a reminder not just of the life he made for himself but the life he left behind. After winning the Tour of Sicily last October he collapsed into the arms of his teammates and cried like a child. That emotion has never been far from the surface, on the bike or off it. Perhaps this is why crowds, and particularly Italian crowds, respond to Nibali in a way few cycling crowds do anywhere. This is a bruised and bruising sport, one whose heroes are summarily burned and disgraced, where nobody is ever quite sure about what they are seeing and so nobody is ever quite sure how to feel. But whether in victory or defeat, people feel things about Nibali. They want to salute and exalt him. They want to sprint up mountains and catch the drops of sweat from his face. They want to believe. For the Italian public he represents something else too. Since Nibali’s last Giro win in 2016 no Italian has won the race, either the male or female version. A sixth consecutive foreign winner would constitute the country’s longest drought in history. The dominant language of the peloton is now English. The overwhelming flow of money into the sport comes from outside Europe – Bahrain, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, the United States. Italy has not had its own WorldTour-level team for six years and for all its rich heritage that sensation of decline – of a sport it once dominated but which now belongs to everyone else – is hard to escape. Nibali, for his part, has never been an in-my-day sort of rider. Even so, as younger rivals begin to surpass him, as the sport begins to professionalise and compartmentalise, one occasionally detects a hint of nostalgia there. Often he has lamented the tyranny of data, the way some people try to reduce this panorama of tactics and intuition to a game of wattages and power curves. For Nibali, the first and best marginal gain has always been racecraft: the instinct not just to suffer and win but to honour and entertain. This, perhaps, is how Nibali so often won races he had no business whatsoever winning. On the climb or on the descent, on the cobbles or on the open road, over six hours or three weeks: Nibali always trusted in his ability to read a race, to plot its twists and its breaks, his “desire to attack, to try without calculating”, as he once put it. Milan-San Remo may not be quite the sprinters’ classic it once was, but Nibali’s victory in 2018, disappearing over the top of the Poggio and maintaining his lead all the way to the finish, still counts as one of its most sensational shocks. The wins have begun to dry up over the last couple of years. Still, at some point during this year’s Giro you can be sure Nibali will launch an attack and you can be equally sure that the reception that greets it will be the equal of anything heard over the next three weeks. Perhaps it will even be on the slopes of Etna, the slopes he raced down alone as a child, but which are now alive with the sight of bikes, a revolution that in large part he inspired. To be beaten, you see, is not the same as failing.",Sport/Sport,Old-school racer Vincenzo Nibali gears up for what may be his last Giro d’Italia | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/03/cycling-vincenzo-nibali-giro-ditalia
5/3/2022,"David O’Mara is reminiscing about the job that started it all. “A family friend knew someone who had a painting company and they said, ‘Oh, you’ve been to art college, you’ll be all right!’” He laughs. “But I hadn’t touched a paintbrush in years. I was into conceptual art.” It was 2001 and O’Mara had just moved from Ireland to London with his girlfriend; he’d never envisaged working on a building site but he needed the work and soon found he could pick up the skills. He also realised the money was good, much better than in the arts. “I looked into working in a gallery, but those jobs are hard to find and often they don’t want to pay you,” he says. “It’s insane. A lot of the time, you need a lot of cultural capital even to be considered.” And cultural capital – easy familiarity with upper-class values and traditions – was something he didn’t have, despite the art college degree. Born in 1973 and raised in Waterford, south-east Ireland, O’Mara grew up working-class. Discovering fine art through books, he studied in his home city and then at Dublin’s National College of Art and Design, where he became interested in conceptual art and the situationists, the social revolutionaries who inspired Paris’s 1968 protests, and then the punks. O’Mara got into found photographs through the situationists. Drawing on their ideas about urbanism and the proliferation of images under consumerism, he walked the streets of Dublin looking for abandoned photographs and negatives. When he got to London he continued the practice, walking to work and back to search for lost photos. He also got into the habit of carrying a camera and taking his own photographs, and eventually began shooting at work. “When I started painting and decorating, I was very intimidated by the environment, but a couple of years in I was much more relaxed,” he says. “I knew everyone around me, and I always had my camera, so I just started taking photographs. No one had a problem with it, though sometimes they took the piss. They were my friends – we worked together, we had a laugh together. It can be a lot of fun on site, there’s a lot of autonomy compared with working in an office.” O’Mara’s images show some of the sheer toil that goes into the sites, with shots of builders hard at work shovelling or drilling, sparks flying. But there are also photographs that capture the surreal nature of taking a place apart and putting it back together: a pair of feet dangling from the ceiling, for example, or gloves jauntily placed on a ladder. Some of the images show O’Mara’s colleagues giving him the two-fingered salute, or showing him their own photographs on their phones, emphasising his personal connection and a sense of intimacy. Art and manual labour don’t have to be worlds apart, his shots suggest. The crews in London are multicultural, often including immigrants as well as working-class Brits. O’Mara has seen an Indian carpenter and Polish bricklayer communicating on a job in German, the one language they had in common. He’s also come across some true characters. His first boss was a philosophy graduate whose best friend had gone awol from the military and was sleeping under the kitchen table. Then there was the electrician who had been expelled from the Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the Polish musician who’d play his own experimental compositions on site. To O’Mara, this music sounded “like noise” but he appreciated the creative spark, as well as others with less obvious flair. “Everyone has a history and a story to tell,” he points out. “Everyone has interests. It might not be official but everyone knows about something.” O’Mara continued to pursue his art, painting and decorating five days a week, then spending Saturday in the darkroom printing his own images. In the early 2000s he staged a large exhibition he funded by putting in “seven days a week on the sites”. The images were mounted on aluminium, which he then had to heft around whenever he moved house. “I thought, ‘There has to be an easier way!’” he laughs and, remembering his first love of art books, decided to publish a magazine. Called Detritus, his magazine was printed on newsprint to keep costs down and make it easy to give away. By 2012 O’Mara was also putting together handmade books of his images: one-offs or just a handful at a time, printed on papers he found in the street and housed in boxes or suitcases he found in skips. He created his most recent handmade book a few months ago, printing it on decorator’s lining paper and giving the cover a swipe of house paint. Called Spit and Sawdust, it’s an edition of just five copies, priced at £200 each. O’Mara claims he’s bad at marketing, and quickly tired of trying to push himself on the London gallery scene. “Hideous,” he calls it. “Going to exhibition openings and trying to network made me paranoid.”. But he managed to get seen on his own terms. He set up an Instagram account, @detrituszine, in 2017 and quickly started to attract photography curators and publishers. He started selling his handmade books via Photobookstore in 2019 after meeting its owner at a photobook festival. In 2019 he released his first book with a publisher, If you can piss … (the title derived from the building site epithet: “If you can piss, you can paint”), with Jannuzzi Smith Editions. This year he will release another book, In Situ, with “small, punky outfit” Salt n Pepper Press. He decided to work with publishers, he says, because manual labour is seldom shown in photography, let alone taken by the people who do it. “Photography is a middle-class ghetto,” he says. “There’s not a lot of representation of the working class in photography, and I really hate poverty porn – bleeding-heart, middle class liberals taking the working class as a subject. Once I had started accumulating a body of images, I tried to think of equivalent projects and I couldn’t. So I thought it was something worth doing.” For O’Mara this lack of representation links with a wider malaise and erasure of working-class lives and labour. The traditional route of learning a trade or craft has been devalued, he says, as has nursing, or even teaching; manual work is now seen as “dirty”. This erasure is quite literal on building sites, where the aim is to paint yourself out of the door, then go. “You’re making everything pristine,” he says. “When you leave it shouldn’t look like you’ve been there.” For O’Mara photography is a way to preserve that labour, as well as the dirt that goes with it; he often uses black-and-white film, partly because it’s cheaper, partly because it can handle the varied light on site, but also because it shows up the grime. “Dirt is a big part of the work,” he says, laughing. “You do get sweaty and filthy. My job is physical and I enjoy that aspect of it, just as I enjoy the physical aspect of printing photographs.” David O’Mara’s Spit and Sawdust is available from Photobookstore. In Situ will be published this year by Salt n Pepper Press.",Arts/Art and design,‘You get filthy’ – the photographer who shoots manual labourers in building sites,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/03/filthy-photographer-david-omara-manual-labourers-bricklayers
5/3/2022,"Have you checked your ID privilege lately? Because in recent days I’ve observed with unprecedented clarity that it’s becoming a phenomenon in Britain. There are two types of citizen in this country: those who feel compelled to carry proof that their presence is legal. And those secure enough, entitled even, to barely give it a thought. Until recently, I have always been in the second category. It’s cultural. ID cards are totally un-British – as I discovered when I first started writing about civil liberties for the Guardian 15 years ago. Government proposals to introduce them back then stirred a deep well of Magna Carta-philia and a libertarian distrust of positive law. British people don’t expect to have to prove their identity unless collecting a parcel or checking in for a flight. Unless you are a visible minority, that is. For us, that entitlement is gradually being eroded. Being asked where we are from, “Go home” vans, the Windrush scandal. The escalation from rhetorical othering, to the actual, violent deportation of people perfectly entitled to be here, shook Britain’s black community to our core. Last week, a new level of escalation. A 17-year-old boy from Kent ran away from a hospital. He is British, black and non-verbal, and was being treated for his mental health. Reportedly in a state of distress, having attempted to travel to Manchester and back with no money, phone, or – by the time he returned – even any shoes, he was arrested by British Transport Police for not having a train ticket. So far this is a story about the carceral state, straight from the abolitionist textbooks. The Black Lives Matter movement familiarised everyone with what happens when a vulnerable black person is met not with support, solutions, or even basic compassion, but with the brutality of law enforcement and criminalisation. Tragically, we are familiar with their names in many cases because it ended in their death – Sean Rigg, Mzee Mohammed, Leon Briggs, Kingsley Burrell. What British Transport Police did in this case, however, offers a sinister new twist. Claiming to have “interviewed” this non-verbal young person, its officers concluded that he was a Nigerian who had come to the country illegally. Since he allegedly failed to give satisfactory or reliable answers (did I mention that he was non-verbal?) the authorities began steps – according to paperwork he was later found carrying – for his “imminent” deportation. The implications are alarming. “I now have to factor in the possibility,” wrote one Mumsnet user, “that if I should be knocked on the head or suffer a seizure, anything rendering me incapable of speech while outside and not carrying anything identifying, I might soon find myself locked up in an immigration detention centre.” In a private group of which I’m a member, friends berated each other for not carrying ID already. “Ever since Windrush, I carry my British passport with me at all times,” said one black woman. “My white husband never carries anything. That’s the world we live in now.” If this sounds like an overreaction, consider the context. This was also the week that the Nationality and Borders Act was passed by the House of Commons. Its Rwanda plans – shipping asylum seekers randomly to the central African country, which incidentally is already the most densely populated on the African continent – are probably illegal and almost certainly unworkable. As we already know with this government, all of this is immaterial because the prime minister and his government are comfortable with breaking the law and more interested in optics than outcomes. The Rwanda story has also distracted the public from the reality that the new act will also affect British people. Especially those who either have, or are entitled to, dual nationality, affecting about 6 million black, Asian and Jewish Britons. Its clause 9 has to be read to be believed. The government can now strip us of our citizenship, and if it deems it “not reasonably practicable”, or “not in the public interest”, does not even need to give us notice that it’s doing so. Nationality is a birthright, not a privilege. But now those of us designated less entitled to it by this legislation will all have to check ourselves on that too. The experience of this non-verbal teenager in Kent strikes a chord because it confirms two things that many of us already suspected. The first is that new laws are being enacted in a climate of racial profiling. As the sister of this young man said: “If [the police] had met a white teenage minor who was barefoot and distressed, would their first instinct be to deport him? Of course not. But when they saw my brother they didn’t see a boy in pain, they saw his race.” Similar observations were made by supporters of Child Q, a 15-year-old girl who was left traumatised after being strip searched by police officers in school while on her period. Widespread protests followed her mistreatment, and the children’s commissioner has recently reported that black children are overpoliced and adultified in settings where they should be being nurtured. The second is that protections the government claims will prevent injustice will be undermined by incompetence. When it came to the Kent teenager, the Home Office got so much wrong: his name, his date of birth, his nationality, the state of his mental health (an assessment raised no mental health issues when in fact he was under a Mental Health Act section order) and his ability to be interviewed. This is a toxic combination that creates two tiers of British citizens. The first tier – those who retain ID privilege. People who think, as British citizens, laws on immigration and asylum do not apply to them, people who do not think about having to prove their identity or immigration status, people who feel their presence in their own country is a right, not a privilege at all. Every single British person should be in this category. But we are not. Now, any of us whose visible minority appearance could be interpreted by the above incompetent and racially profile-leaning authorities as not really British, belong in a different category. Our tendency to be racially or religiously othered is well – established. Now we know that this othering can be converted into actual attempts to deport us and strip us of our citizenship, and even do so without notice. In the run-up to the new Rwanda asylum plans, the civil servants involved in implementing it wrestled with their personal consciences. In a reference to the Nuremberg Nazi trials, one wrote: “The words ‘I was only obeying orders’ are echoing down through history to me and making me queasy.” And so they should. Because we have plenty of historic precedents for what happens when a country starts dividing its citizens into tiers based on their heritage. And none of them end well.

5/3/2022,"In the cool air of an April dawn, Marie Sambou, an oyster harvester, carves through the brown water of the Gambia River’s Tanbi wetland in her long wooden canoe. The size of Manhattan, Tanbi teems with life. The mangroves provide an important habitat for many birds and fish, which nest, breed and spawn in the protective, nutrient-rich environment. Snow-white egrets stalk schools of needle-like fish nipping through the shallows as curlews and hornbills whirl overhead, and higher still, vultures turn in lazy circles. For the next six hours or so, while the tide remains low enough to work, Sambou will paddle along the forests on the riverbank, knocking hard, rock-like west African mangrove oysters (Crassostrea tulipa) from the exposed mangrove roots. It is tedious, physical work – and painful. Sambou has only thin gloves and socks for protection; her hands and feet are scarred from the razor-edged oyster shells. Members of the TRY Oyster Women’s Association, based in the Gambian village of Lamin. Below left, the harvesters head out on Lamin Bolong, a tributary of the Gambia River, to collect oysters from the mangroves. Right, Marie Sambou and another member of the association in their canoes Once the tide rises and resubmerges the mangrove roots, the rest of the day is given over to preparing the raw oysters on land – first steaming them in large steel drums, then removing the green-grey meat, which is flicked into wicker baskets. At the end of the day, the baskets of prepared oysters are taken to the roadsides and markets of Banjul, the country’s capital, where they can be exposed in the heat for hours or days, and must be sold before the hard work of gathering them is wasted. For consumers, this labour is the hidden background to a tasty treat used in a variety of traditional west African dishes, such as oyster stew and oysters in lime. But for harvesters such as Sambou, making a sustainable living has been a matter of balancing environmental and financial responsibilities. Marie Sambou harvesting oysters from the mangroves in a creek and on the Gambia River. It can be dangerous work, wielding a heavy-bladed knife with only rubber gloves for protection. As high tides prevent the women collecting oysters, they must gather as many as possible when they have the chance Unlike other fishing in the Gambia, the oyster trade is entirely run by women, who pick, process, cook and sell them. Like most Gambian harvesters, Sambou, 33, is from the Jola people, an ethnic group known across Senegal and the Gambia for their hardworking agricultural roots. Along with about 500 other women in the Tanbi area, she is a member of the TRY Oyster Women’s Association, a collective founded by a social worker, Fatou Janha Mboob, in 2007. A community-based, non-profit organisation, TRY aims to improve harvesters’ lives through environmental and social initiatives, and training in financial management, food hygiene and water safety. Mboob wanted to make the harvesters a cohesive part of the ecosystem, rather than a force acting against it. In 2012, she successfully lobbied the Gambian government to make Tanbi a “special management area”, within which TRY members have exclusive harvesting rights. As the harvesters’ season lasts only four months, the women have to gather enough to help them subsist through the rest of the year Before the TRY, the harvesters worked Tanbi’s mangroves very differently, hacking off roots entirely and picking even small, unsaleable oysters. Through educational initiatives organised by Mboob and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), TRY members were encouraged to consider themselves stewards of the mangroves; roots are now left intact, and harvesters prevent others from chopping them for firewood. TRY is also involved in reforestation; as part of a UNDP-funded project, members planted more than 50,000 mangrove seedlings. In 2011, they voted in favour of a closed harvesting season, from March to June, and to set a minimum size for collecting oysters. To increase the oysters’ market value, TRY members agreed to charge a standard 50 dalasis (75p) for a cup, a fivefold increase over previous average prices, which were decided by each woman. Women tie up their boats in the harbour near Lamin village before preparing their catch for sale On a good day, Sambou might harvest, steam and shell enough oysters to make 2,000 dalasis (£30). But on other days the low tide is at night, or too late in the afternoon to make it worth going on the river. And with the TRY harvesters’ season lasting only four months, money remains their primary concern. Most supplement their earnings with subsistence farming. During the off-season, Sambou travels south to the Senegal’s Casamance region to buy cockles and oysters to sell in Banjul. To address this unregulated harvesting, TRY is working to expand its reach to the Allahein River, which forms the Gambia’s southern border. Top left, the ‘oyster ladies’ sort through their catch in the harbour. Top right and below left, Marie Sambou carries a tub of the molluscs through Lamin village. Below right, Marie prepares to steam and shuck the oysters for sale Climate change also affects the work; floods are increasingly common and can cause sewage to leak into the mangroves, spoiling the filter-feeding oysters. Though TRY has achieved progress ecologically, for Sambou and Mboob the focus now is to raise the harvesters’ standard of living by improving facilities. Mboob envisions a designated market area for shellfishers within Banjul, so harvesters do not have to sell at the roadside and their wares can be kept in saleable condition. “Unless we have a processing area, we cannot sell oysters properly,” she says. “We want to vacuum pack the oysters and sell them in the supermarkets, in hotels and in local restaurants. You cannot take the oysters being sold at the roadside and take them to the supermarket.” Top left, family and friends shuck oysters together. Top right, an oyster after it has been smoked. Below left, two women stand over a large pit of coals as the oysters are smoked – a low-tech way to preserve the food. Below right, selling the oysters in Serekunda market in Banjul. One cup of oysters costs 35 dalasis Sambou would like refrigeration, allowing the women to store their catch and avoiding the need to take oysters straight to market, thereby spreading their income over the year. But many women live without electricity, and establishing that infrastructure on the banks of Lamin Bolong, a tributary of the Gambia River, would be complicated and costly. Those goals might be distant, but the pair’s work has not gone unnoticed. In 2012, Mboob received the 2012 Equator prize from the UNDP Equator Initiative. And in 2019, Sambou’s leadership among the harvesters was recognised with a Young Business Innovation of the Year award from the Global Youth Innovation Network Gambia. Such recognition is overdue, says Mboob. “We want people to know that the harvesters matter. They’re the ones who protect the environment, who protect Tanbi and the mangroves. The harvesters take care of each other. Because of that, and because of their hard work, they are empowered.” The TRY Oyster Women’s Association: protecting the environment and improving their livelihoods",News/Global development,Stewards of the forest: the pioneering women’s collective harvesting the Gambia’s oysters,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/03/stewards-of-the-forest-the-pioneering-womens-collective-harvesting-the-gambias-oysters
5/3/2022,"BP’s profits more than doubled to $6.2bn (£5bn) in the first three months of the year, boosted by soaring oil and gas prices. It was well ahead of the $4.5bn of expected by analysts and is likely to revive calls for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who argue the money raised could be used to ease the burden for those hardest hit by the cost of living costs. BP announced a $2.5bn share buyback programme on the back of the bumper profits. The UK oil group made an underlying replacement cost profit of $6.2bn between January and March, compared with $2.6bn in the same quarter last year. This was driven by “exceptional oil and gas trading”, higher oil prices and better refining results. However, including a $24bn pretax charge related to its exit from its investment in the Russian state-owned oil and gas group Rosneft, BP reported a headline loss of $20.4bn. Bernard Looney, the BP chief executive, said: “In a quarter dominated by the tragic events in Ukraine and volatility in energy markets, bp’s focus has been on supplying the reliable energy our customers need.
