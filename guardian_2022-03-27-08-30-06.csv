3/27/2022,"After the year England’s Test team have had, nine out of 10 captains would have resigned or been sacked. Joe Root survived, somehow, while several other heads rolled. After impressing Andrew Strauss with his appetite, he was given the chance to rebuild his own broken team. He banished Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, the only top-class bowlers at his disposal. And in the first two Tests in West Indies, it looked as if it might just be working. Even a Root-o-sceptic had to admit that there were signs of progress. The fielding was sharper, the team spirit stronger, the batters were shaking off the dismal shackles of the Chris Silverwood era. Dan Lawrence, miscast as he might be at No 4, belted some selfless runs. And although both those Tests were drawn, it was England who were pressing for victory on the fifth day. But that was on a pair of dead pitches – a double featherbed. In Grenada, on a spicier surface, it’s been glaringly obvious that Root has failed to fix one of his team’s biggest flaws: his own captaincy. On the third morning he ran through his full repertoire of howlers. When Chris Woakes reverted to his overseas inertia with the new ball, Root kept him on for 50 minutes. When Joshua Da Silva tried a big hit, Root moved his third slip into the leg side to save the single. Despite this, the singles kept coming, nearly all of them on the leg side. For one of them, Da Silva sadistically worked the ball just out of Root’s reach at midwicket, leaving him flat on the floor. His red-ball reset was now accompanied by a red-face emoji. You had to feel for him, because he’s so clearly a nice person. The problem is that being nice isn’t what captaincy is about. You can smile and smile and be a duffer. You can be a hard bastard, like Nasser Hussain, and drag your team from bad to better. That is what England need now, and Root is not the man to provide it. To paraphrase Shane Warne’s verdict on Monty Panesar, Root hasn’t really captained England in 64 Tests. He has captained them in much the same Test, 64 times. Joe Root, world-class batsman, has one great misfortune: he has to play under Joe Root, third-class captain. He’s a timid selector, a hopeless reader of a pitch and a terrible tactician. He may come from Yorkshire, but he’s the diametric opposite of Ray Illingworth, Len Hutton or Michael Vaughan – not canny, not calculating, unable to mould his team into more than the sum of their parts. He’s not the conductor of the orchestra: he’s the first violin. He keeps being cast as Sourav Ganguly, when, if just left to bat and bat, he would have a fair chance of being England’s Sachin Tendulkar. “But there’s nobody else,” people say. That is an awful reason for keeping a failed leader in office, and it’s not even true. Mike Brearley, the greatest living expert on cricket captaincy, felt after the Ashes fiasco that it was time for Root to hand over to Ben Stokes, who led a bunch of understudies to a whitewash over Pakistan last summer. Stokes would certainly bring more spark. But he says he doesn’t want the job, and it would be overloading him when he has just shown that he is still a useful fourth seamer. There are two better options. One is to bring back Broad and put him in charge. He’s got the grasp of the game, the gift of the gab, the fire in the belly. And, as we know, he tends to be at his best when he has just been spurned. The other is to send for a specialist, a captain who knows what he is doing and has already made one England team a lot better: Eoin Morgan. You could make room for him by sacrificing Ben Foakes and handing the gloves back to Jonny Bairstow, which would be tough on Foakes but fine for the team. Morgan’s presence, his calm hand on the tiller, would make a huge difference. For the first time since Strauss himself stepped down in 2012, England would have a captain with some authority.",Sport/Sport,England’s big reset is undermined by Joe Root the third-class captain | Tim de Lisle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/26/englands-big-reset-is-undermined-by-joe-root-the-third-class-captain
3/27/2022,"Schools in England will have to offer a minimum school week of 32.5 hours as part of a package of reforms aimed at raising standards, which Labour and unions have condemned as insufficient to support schools that have been left “battered and bruised” by the pandemic.Most schools already deliver a 32.5 hour school week, which is equivalent to 8.45am to 3.15pm from Monday to Friday. However, the government believes there are discrepancies across the country, since 20 minutes less teaching time a day equates to a loss of two weeks of schooling a year.However, teaching unions said they were “unconvinced by the benefits” of introducing a minimum length for school weeks since Department for Education figures suggest three-quarters of schools already offer 32.5-hour weeks.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said it was important to understand the reasons why some schools have fewer hours, for example, some rural schools may choose start and finish times to suit transport arrangements.He said: “Adding time on to the school week may sound straightforward, but there are many issues which need to be considered in individual schools, and we would encourage the government not to rush any changes.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), was sceptical that adding under 20 minutes to the school day would “bring much, if any, benefit”, and asked that the plan be underpinned by a review of evidence.Labour criticised the plans for being too limited in scope to tackle the scale of the problems with educational standards, with 200,000 primary age children living in areas with no schools rated as good or outstanding and the pandemic widening the learning gap between richer and poorer children.Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said: “After two years of pandemic chaos and six years since the government’s last schools strategy, parents, teachers and pupils will be left wondering where the ambition for children’s futures is. For almost eight in 10 schools the education secretary’s big idea is to carry on as normal.” Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said the plans would not “address the huge challenges that battered and bruised schools face to support all their pupils during and beyond a pandemic”. He asked: “Where is the multifaceted recovery plan? What should happen in the extra 10-15 mins some pupils will now spend in school? How will pupil wellbeing and education staff workloads be improved to ensure their time together is as impactful as both want and deserve?”The plans form part of a suite of changes to be set out on Monday by the Department for Education in a schools white paper are aimed at bringing up the percentage of children leaving primary school who have achieved the expected standard in reading, writing and maths from 65% to 90% by 2030.The changes are expected to include plans for all schools to join academy chains, which ministers believe will improve standards and give them more autonomy from local councils. The white paper is also expected to include ways to make apprenticeship and vocational routes more aspirational for young people and their parents including by overhauling T-levels to make them as prestigious as A-levels, the Mail on Sunday reported.On Tuesday, the government will also publish a long-awaited special educational needs and disability strategy in a green paper, which will suggest ways for mainstream schools to better accommodate disabled students, followed by an open public consultation. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “Over my time as education secretary, my guiding focus has been creating opportunity for all, with strong schools and great teachers for every child. Every plan and policy I will set out in next week’s schools white paper works towards this goal.”",News/Education,Ministers to make school week a minimum of 32.5 hours in England,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/26/ministers-to-make-school-week-a-minimum-of-325-hours-in-england
