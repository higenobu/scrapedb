3/30/2022,"When I was 17 years old, a doctor told me the spots on my liver were likely tumors. With a proper diagnosis at 32, I found my passion in weightlifting and bodybuilding. This is Marta Horvath's story, as told to Kitti Palmai. When I was 17 years old, my parents took me for a thorough one-day medical checkup. It's called a ""manager screening"" here in Hungary, where I'm from, and it involves all types of tests, from blood tests to an ultrasound. The doctors at the screening said they found spots on my liver, first with an ultrasound and then with an MRI. They suggested it could be liver cancer. That's where the suffering of the next 15 years started. I took my tests to another doctor for a second opinion. He said it was a large hemangioma, a benign liver tumor, and warned against doing things like heavy lifting or falling over because it could cause a blood vessel to rupture. The only treatment doctors proposed was a liver transplant. To be prepared for a rare fatal complication, I drafted a goodbye text to my parents on my phone. I never imagined that 16 years later I would be not only competing as a bodybuilder but also winning the Ms. Olympia title in the Angel category of the 2018 Natural Olympia, a major bodybuilding competition. It was the best way to end the years of struggles caused by being misdiagnosed. It took me many years to find out that the spots on my liver were not harmful at all. After that second opinion, I sought advice from more doctors, trying to find a less invasive treatment than a transplant. But the whole experience broke me. I was living in fear. My doctors wanted to put me on the transplant list because they thought that was the only treatment. The mental struggles led to depression, followed by eating disorders, reflux, and other stress-related symptoms. One day, when I was 22 years old, a specialist suggested a liver biopsy after my blood test came back with a hepatitis-like result — which I had been vaccinated against. I checked all my medications for potential side effects, and one clearly stated the possibility of the hepatitis-like blood-test result I had. That's when I started to question the diagnosis and trashed all my medications. Maybe it was partly youthful rebellion as a university student, but it had become too much for me to handle. The next 10 years went by without doctors' appointments, but deep down I felt it wasn't right. I loved all kinds of sports, from snowboarding to tennis, but I thought I shouldn't be doing them. As a result of my eating disorder and stress, I lost a lot of weight. I started looking into healthier food choices and doing light training at the gym. It was my way of escape. At 32, I finally met with a doctor who changed my life. When I handed over my thick medical folder, the doctor calmed me by saying, ""If truly this was your condition, do you think we'd sit here and chat right now?"" After getting an isotopic angiography, the doctor confirmed that the spots on my liver are like pigmentation spots — which could be hereditary, from birth control, or teenage acne medication — but are nothing serious. It took me a couple years to really believe that I was healthy. With my newfound well-being, my initial goal was to do a 220-pound squat lift. Shortly after hitting that goal, I was introduced to bodybuilding, and my first competition was on my 33rd birthday. I'd gotten a taste, and within three years, I qualified for and won the 2018 Natural Olympia in Las Vegas as the first Hungarian in the Angel category. Since then, I've become a nutritional coach, judged bodybuilding competitions, and help others prepare for contests. While the misdiagnosis took away years of physical activity, I'm grateful I get to compete in my newfound passion.

3/30/2022,"A Georgia cop probably thought no one was watching when he took his squad car to a scrubby area off a quiet road in a small Georgia town, walked around the back, and started having sex with someone while in uniform. But someone high up in a nearby telecommunications tower started filming and uploaded the videos to TikTok last week where they quickly racked up more than 15 million views. “Police caught on cam!!!” one video was captioned, along with hashtags of #towerclimbers and #dirtydeeds. Now the officer, identified by local news channel WRDW as Millen Police Officer Larry “Benjamin” Thompson, has quit and a record of past misconduct has come to light. Satellite maps from White Oak Road in Millen, a town of about 3,500 people about an hour south of Augusta, show the same tower, nearby cemetery, and patches of dirt and bushes that can be seen in the TikTok videos. The map also shows a school across the street. Millen Police Chief Dwayne Herrington told WRDW he was planning to meet with Thompson on Monday about a “video” but Thompson quit beforehand. Georgia state records show Thompson had worked on-and-off for the department since 2015. According to Millen City Council meeting minutes, Thompson was involved in a car crash while at work in November 2019. WRDW reported that he killed a 76-year-old driver, identified in a local obituary as Lewis Jenkins, when he t-boned Jenkins’ car while racing to a call at 86 miles per hour. The network also obtained investigation documents showing that, while working for the Millen fire department in 2017, Thompson accidentally discharged his gun, shooting a colleague in the arm. He claimed the gun malfunctioned while he was cleaning it but an internal probe found the weapon had no malfunctions. “This is not an excuse to be accepted; only a reflection after the fact,” the criminal investigative division wrote in its report. “Though it is referred to as an ‘accidental discharge,’ essentially it is a ‘negligent discharge.’” Then in 2020, a woman who’d been in a relationship with Thompson contacted Millen Police to accuse him of harassing her. Thompson admitted to running her tags to find her new address, claiming he was trying to return some old items to her, according to a case summary. He was suspended for two days. The Millen Police Department did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s request for comment Tuesday. Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/30/2022,"Donald Trump famously called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s emails ahead of the 2016 election. He’s now calling on Vladimir Putin to dig up dirt on President Biden’s family. The ask came during an interview with Just the News on Real America’s Voice, with the former president citing a Senate report that found a Russian oligarch once gave $3.5 million to a company he claims was founded by Biden’s son, Hunter. “Why did the mayor of Moscow’s wife give the Bidens, both of them, $3.5 million? That’s a lot of money,” Trump said. “She gave him $3.5 million so I would think Putin would know the answer to that,” Trump said. “I think he should release it. I think we should know that answer.” More from Rolling Stone 'Possible Coverup': White House Logs Show 7-Hour Gap in Trump's Calls on Jan. 6 Liberals and Conservatives Are Battling for the Worst Political Take on Will Smith's Oscars Slap The Supreme Court's Clarence and Ginni Thomas Scandal Is Unprecedented The Senate report to which Trump is referring is a partisan report Republicans released in 2020. The report found that Yelena Baturina gave $3.5 million to a firm called Rosemont Seneca Thornton in 2014. Hunter Biden was the co-founder of a firm called Rosemont Seneca Advisors. Biden’s lawyer told CNN that this is not the same firm that received the “consultancy agreement” payment from Baturina. There is no evidence the payment was corrupt or that Hunter Biden had anything to do with it. This isn’t the first time Trump has sought to collude with Russia to help his electoral chances. The soon-to-be president in a July 2016 news conference called on Russia, “if you’re listening,” to “find the 30,000 emails that are missing” from Clinton’s email server. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s subsequent investigation found that the nation began targeting Clinton’s accounts “on or around” the day of Trump’s request. It’s also not the first time Trump has called on a foreign power to dig up dirt on the Bidens. Trump in 2018 attempted to extort Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into releasing damaging information on the family. Trump delayed congressionally approved military aid to the nation in an effort to force Zelensky to cooperate. The quid-pro-quo led to Trump’s first impeachment that December. Trump’s latest call for Putin’s help comes as the Russia authoritarian is bombarding Ukraine in an unprovoked war that has resulted in thousands of deaths. Trump has repeatedly refused to condemn Putin throughout the invasion. Maybe it’s because he still wants his help.

3/30/2022,"STORY: Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko said on Monday (March 28) 160,000 civilians were still trapped in the city on the Sea of Azov without heat and power after weeks of Russian bombardment. Nearly 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed, a spokesperson for the mayor said. It was not immediately clear how Mayor Vadym Boichenko had calculated the toll from a month of Russian bombardment that has devastated the city and trapped tens of thousands of residents without power and with few supplies. Russia, which sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on February 24, denies targeting civilians and blames Ukraine for the repeated failure to agree on safe corridors for trapped civilians. President Vladimir Putin says Russian forces are on a special operation to degrade its southern neighbor's military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Convoy with 'Z' markings seen heading to Mariupol,https://news.yahoo.com/convoy-z-markings-seen-heading-155404385.html
3/30/2022,"Manchin swung against Biden's new billionaire tax proposal on Monday. The wealthiest Americans shouldn't be taxed on ""things you don't have,"" he said, per Bloomberg. It may spell the end of the road for the latest White House plan. Sen. Joe Manchin poured cold water on President Joe Biden's new billionaire tax plan on Monday, dealing a potentially fatal blow to its prospects in Congress. The wealthiest Americans shouldn't be taxed on ""things you don't have,"" he said, per Bloomberg. ""You might have it on paper. There are other ways for people to pay their fair share, and I think everyone should pay."" The conservative Democrat's reluctance could be the end of the road for the White House proposal. Democrats are closer to reviving swaths of their climate and healthcare agenda, but it can only reach Biden's desk if all 50 Senate Democrats back it. The plan would establish a 20% minimum tax rate on households worth $100 million or more, and would expand the definition of taxable income to include the accruing value of unsold investments like stocks or bonds, otherwise known as unrealized capital gains. Currently, gains on investments are only taxed when they're sold for cash. It was the first time that the Biden administration drew up a plan to hit the growing fortunes of billionaires, and it's meant to change how the American tax code treats income. Most Americans get their income through a paycheck, but the richest families tend to see their wealth grow through the increasing value of their financial investments. Those are often taxed at a much lower rate than income — and only after they're sold for a profit. Some billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk would pay a lot more in taxes to the federal government under the Biden plan. Musk's tax bill would amount to an extra $50 billion over ten years, according to calculations from economist Gabriel Zucman. Manchin had also expressed resistance to a similar tax proposal designed to hit billionaires last fall from Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the chair of the Senate Finance Committee. That plan was aimed at 700 billionaires and was intended to finance much of Biden's social and climate plans. ""I'm supporting basically that everyone should pay their fair share,"" Manchin said in late October. ""And I've just tried to think of it — I don't like the connotation that we're targeting different people.""
