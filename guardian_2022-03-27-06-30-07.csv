3/27/2022,"As bitty, meandering Spring friendlies go this was a quietly fascinating evening at Wembley Stadium. What did we learn? What messages will England take “going forward” from a fortunate 2-1 victory against a dogged Switzerland in a game of weirdly unbound interludes and, at times, a jarringly open England midfield. For one thing, it turns out an hour of Conor Gallagher goes a long way. This was a hugely instructive first England start, although not perhaps in the way those enjoying Gallagher’s flicks and feints, the basic joy of watching a footballer who hares about like a puppy chasing squirrels, might have hoped. At times it felt as though the sight of Gallagher romping about in midfield was like a glimpse into some alternate reality, a place where Southgate’s England don’t play like Southgate’s England, where the game becomes chancier, riskier less compressed. And really it was all here, the world in grain of sand, the full deep tactical background of Southgate’s England. Flip back over the last six years and the leitmotif of this version of the national team is a struggle between duty and adventure, the triumph of pragmatism and roundhead certainties over cavalier flickers of adventure. Now and then there have been experiments with a little loosing of the bonds, often abandoned just as quickly as they came. Here it took sixty minutes for Southgate to pull the plug. The frown lines, the crossed arms. This was not the look of a man enjoying a Damascene conversion to the unfettered midfield, to creative freedom, open spaces. It is a mark of just how set Southgate’s tactics are that a starting central midfield of Gallagher and Jordan Henderson should come across as recklessly bold, the football manager equivalent of wearing a novelty tie to work and a pair of daring red braces. Henderson and Gallagher both like to run forward, to play ahead of the midfield bolt. Here Gallagher sprinted sixty yards upfield and sixty yards back in the opening minutes without touching the ball once, flowing blond tresses catching the late evening light, Four minutes in he was surging off down the right, pulling a cross back, leaping to kung-fu trap a high pass, drawing squeals of approval from the youthful crowd. And in those early minutes Gallagher looked like a man having the time of his life, running off a spurt of adrenaline that just kept on refusing to die. Here is an England international who really, really, really, really likes playing football. Is that good? Is it OK? It was certainly fun to watch. Although steadily those spaces began to open up, great green holes in England’s rump. For all Gallagher’s invention and edge he will probably be blamed for going forward too much, for leaving Henderson, who isn’t a proper deep shielding player, whirling about pointing and yelling, spooked by the space around him. None of this was Gallagher’s fault exactly. He played like Conor Gallagher. He occupied the spaces Conor Gallagher likes to occupy. This imbalance is surely on Southgate, a tactical wallflower being asked, reluctantly to dance, and sending out a team that really didn’t look prepped for it. Xherdan Shaqiri caused endless problems dropping into a deep inside right channel. Marc Guéhi came out to close the space and was often a little exposed. The relationship between wing-back and centre half is the most common point of weakness in this system. Switzerland exploited that loose stitching. But it surely is the job of the coach to address these things, to make sure the players in those roles know exactly how to seal that join. Surely the rest of this England team should be drilled enough to manage these spaces. Should England really need to field seven defensive players just to keep a lid on Switzerland at Wembley? It took 21 minutes to gouge a thumb right into that weak spot. Shaqiri cut inside from and delivered a lovely dipping left-footed cross for Breel Embolo, lurking expertly, to nod the ball back across and into the net. England’s equaliser just before half time was made by a nice piece of closing down from Kyle Walker-Peters. Gallagher shimmied inside. His quick pass across goal became an inadvertent assist for Luke Shaw, whose wonderful spanked drive billowed the Wembleynet. The second half was a slightly different story. England seemed to have closed some of those spaces. With an hour gone there was a quadruple change as Gallagher came off and Southgate went to a solid looking 4-2-3-1. The penalty award for Harry Kane’s winning goal was soft. But England had control by then, with Declan Rice, Henderson and Jude Bellingham occupying the ground in those central areas. The reality is all three of those players – and Rice is well on his way to becoming England’s best player – will be ahead of Gallagher in Southgate’s roster, with Kalvin Phillips to follow. Probably this glimpse will remain little more than a brief spring bloom. And it isn’t hard to see why Southgate is so conservative. This has, let’s face it, been the super-strength of this England team. Five games at a tournament without shipping a goal. Why would you compromise that? This is how England have prospered, with time to draw breath and keep the ball in deep areas. What did we learn? Mainly, that for all the notes of fun here, England will be playing 3-4-3 when it matters. The double midfield bolt isn’t going anywhere. Gareth is as Gareth does. And this really isn’t the moment to get off the boat.",Sport/Football,An hour of Gallagher’s flicks and feints goes a long way for Southgate | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/26/an-hour-of-gallaghers-flicks-and-feints-goes-a-long-way-for-southgate
3/27/2022,"The rapper Cardi B has beaten a lawsuit filed against her by three beachgoers who claimed they had been defamed during an altercation over parking. A lawsuit filed in New York last year alleged that the singer’s sister, Hennessy Carolina, and Carolina’s girlfriend, Michelle Diaz, had blocked the plaintiffs in. When one of the plaintiffs, Manuel Alarcon, who was wearing a Maga hat, approached Diaz, Carolina started filming, the suit said. The plaintiffs accused her of using “foul and threatening language and defamatory statements” and spraying “copious spittle upon said plaintiffs as she raged”. The plaintiffs accused Carolina of using intimidating language, calling the group “racist Maga supporters”. Cardi B, who last week became the first female rapper with multiple songs surpassing 10m sales, tweeted video of the altercation, claiming her sister was targeted because she is Afro-Hispanic and gay. A New York trial judge dismissed the case, saying Carolina’s insults did not rise to the level of defamation. The legal win comes two months after Cardi B was award $1.25m in damages in a defamation action against the gossip blogger Tasha K.",Arts/Music,Cardi B beats lawsuit over alleged defamation during parking feud,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/26/cardi-b-sister-carolina-hennessy-lawsuit-defamation
3/27/2022,"Jordan Pickford (GK) Distribution was not perfect, but not at fault for the goal and pulled off a superb save to push Fabian Frei’s half-volley on to the bar. 8 Ben White (RCB) Started as one of three centre-backs, then moved to right-back when Walker-Peters went off. One lovely long pass to Foden in the first half, but sometimes seemed off the pace defensively. 6 Conor Coady (CB) A decent display at the heart of England’s defence, and commanding in the air. Had the better of a couple of muscular confrontations with Embolo. 6 Marc Guéhi |(LCB) As left-sided centre-back was most exposed to an on-song Shaqiri and allowed the Swiss to cut inside too easily on occasions. First to rebound when Shaqiri’s shot was saved in the first half. 6 Kyle Walker-Peters (RWB) Often in space on the right but his crossing was not threatening. Excellent diving interception led to England’s equaliser at the end of the first half. 7 Conor Gallagher (CM) A pressing machine, whose enthusiasm was impressive and engaging. A few good moments on the ball, including a chipped pass to create a chance for Kane and an assist for the equaliser. 8 Jordan Henderson (CM) Looked more comfortable when Rice arrived to assist his previously lonely efforts in central midfield. As ever, made himself available as a passing option when England had the ball. 7 Mason Mount (CM) It was telling that of all the moments Mount was involved in the greatest cheer was for his substitution. Plenty of effort, but it didn’t quite click. 6 Luke Shaw (LWB) Credit for a perfectly timed run and shot for England’s equaliser, but not always so convincing in defence and might have done more to block Shaqiri’s cross for the visitor’s goal. 6 Phil Foden (CF) Marginally the best of England’s attacking players in the first half and it was his willingness to chase an apparently lost cause that led to Frei’s mistake and England’s equaliser. 7 Harry Kane (CF) Not the captain’s finest international hour. Too many touches into trouble, passes incomplete and efforts on goal lacking conviction – though not when he got a chance from the penalty spot. 6 Substitutes Raheem Sterling (for Walker-Peters, 61) 6 Part of the improvement after the switch to 4-2-3-1 with an hour played. Tyrick Mitchell (for Shaw, 61) 6 Notably nutmegged by Mbabu and Zaqiri within five minutes of coming on. But an excellent cross for Kane. Declan Rice (for Gallagher, 61) 7 For all Gallagher’s exuberance England were much better when Rice brought more solidity. Jack Grealish (for Mount, 61) 7 Provided a couple of his trademark jinking runs. Bellingham (for Foden, 80) 6 Not enough time to catch the eye.
