4/23/2022,"Wimbledon’s decision to bar Russian and Belarusian players from this year’s tournament is outrageous and hypocritical (Wimbledon ban Russian and Belarusian players over Ukraine invasion, 20 April). Did they ban Stan Smith, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe or Pete Sampras during the wars waged by the US government in Vietnam, Iraq or Afghanistan? Where does this madness stop –is my local club to ban anyone from Russia? What about businesses? The Russian people are no more to blame for this war than the average American for those US government wars – or, dare I say it, the British people for the wanton slaughter of hundreds of sailors on the retreating Belgrano during the Falklands war. One of the highlights of 2021 for me was attending super Saturday with the finals of the ladies’ singles and doubles. If Wimbledon refuses to reverse this ban, I will, very sadly, be neither attending nor watching this year.Bruce HammLondon  Russian and Belarusian tennis players are private individuals, no more responsible for the Russian government’s illegal invasion of Ukraine than I, as a private UK citizen, was responsible for our government’s illegal invasion of Iraq in 2003. Many Russian oligarchs are deeply complicit in Vladimir Putin’s corrupt regime and are, like national sports teams, liable to being sanctioned. But the recent action of the All England Lawn Tennis Club smacks of blind populism at best, and racism at worst.Peter NicklinNewcastle upon Tyne  Congratulations to the Association of Tennis Professionals and the Women’s Tennis Association for their principled stand against the intrusion of politics into their sport. As the WTA has said: “Discrimination, and the decision to focus such discrimination against athletes competing on their own as individuals, is neither fair nor justified.” Will the players now take the next step, and threaten a boycott of their own in solidarity with their fellow ATP and WTA members?Fay MarshallBrighton  The decision to ban Russian players from Wimbledon is understandable but unhelpful. It is well recognised that we need to drive a wedge between Vladimir Putin and the Russian people. This is Putin’s war, and he uses these sorts of western responses as evidence that the west hates Russia. A better approach is to highlight that we value the freedom of Russian people, their literature and their music, and their engagement as individuals in the civil processes of society such as sport. If they were allowed to participate in Wimbledon, these players and their support staff would go home with new information about the war, having watched the news and conversed with other players. That is what we desperately want to spread into Russia. Our moral behaviour must be decided by our moral values, not by Putin.Prof Paul GilbertUniversity of Derby  Congratulations to Wimbledon for banning Russian players from this year’s tournament. And eternal shame on the Association of Tennis Professionals and the Women’s Tennis Association for opposing such a ban. Especially with war raging as Russia attempts to wipe out the few Ukrainians left standing in Mariupol. Anyone claiming that sport is above politics is either woefully mistaken or pushing a very wrong agenda. Sporting and cultural bans are incredibly powerful in the long term. And Russia has to stay isolated for years to come, at the very least until Ukrainian sportsmen and women feel comfortable playing games with this murderous, pillaging, raping, torturing, inhumane pariah state.Stuart KerrChiswick, London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/23/2022,"Thank you for your marvellous obituary of Harrison Birtwistle (18 April), Accrington’s greatest son (and I’m not forgetting Dave “Haggis” Hargreaves, Accrington Stanley’s record goalscorer). Harri never deviated from his principles. As a result, he did not succumb to the temptation – as other composers of his, and the newer, generation have done – to write occasional popular pieces suitable for Classic FM playlists. Like Benjamin Britten, I walked out halfway through his Punch and Judy due to defeated eardrums. But I have been enthralled by Panic, which so disturbed traditional Prom-goers, The Minotaur (rated by the Guardian as the third best piece of classical music of the 21st century) and much else of his output. None of Harri’s stuff is pleasant listening, but that’s rather the point. You have to fight to get through the thicket of sound to the underlying musical thought. In an age where so much “classical” music is intellectual pap (forgive me, Messrs Einaudi, Rutter, Jenkins etc), Harri stood out like a giant.Simon Lawton-SmithLewisham, London  Without the slightest fuss, let alone flamboyance, Sir Harrison Birtwistle became one of the towering figures in British music. He always spoke his mind, tellingly and with a calm exactness that was memorable. Decades ago, I was involved putting on performances of some of his works (eg a student performance of Down by the Greenwood Side at Kingston Polytechnic), and wrote articles about his works. He always said things that were illuminating and hit the nail on the head. And he was great fun. Not long ago, after I’d been ill, I attended a performance of one of his pieces and went backstage afterwards to talk to him. Before leaving, I said to him: “You know, Harri, the doctor doesn’t think I’ve got long to live.” He looked me up and down and replied: “You look all right to me. Tell the doctor to bugger off.” One of this country’s treasures.Meirion BowenLondon  While I agree with everything said about Harrison Birtwistle in your obituary, there seems to me to be one serious omission from his accepted canon – his opera Yan Tan Tethera. My wife and I were at the opening night on the South Bank in 1986 and it haunted us for years. Such a shame that it has slid into almost complete obscurity – a magical, mystical piece that tugs at the heartstrings.Kay SmithLeeds  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

4/23/2022,"For the last two decades, I have been singing classical music and opera all over the world. There is a dress code for female classical singers, combining “modesty” and exhibitionism: dresses must reach the floor (awkward for walking), with no ankles visible; but they can be backless and low-cut, except shoulders should be covered up if singing religious works or in a place of worship. And high heels are de rigueur (awkward for singing as they throw one’s entire posture out of alignment). Your article (Fashion, fabrics and fishtails – why we need to talk about what female performers wear, 19 April) celebrates individuality in concert wear and invites critics to comment on attire as part of the visual aspect of performance – as long as they are prepared to do it with accurate descriptions and the names of designers. This ignores the enormous elephant in the concert hall: women are being judged on their appearance as well as on their playing and singing. Male performers wear a uniform of white tie and tail coat, leaving them and their critics free to concentrate on the quality of their performance. Why can’t women walk on to the platform to make music without also being expected to make a fashion statement? The stage is not a catwalk. Female performers are as serious about their music as their male counterparts, and deserve to be judged on the substance of what they do rather than on the fripperies of silk and satin that they do it in. My response has been to make an appointment at a tailor to be measured for a tail coat, trousers and made-to-measure shirts, which I shall enjoy wearing with comfortable, flat shoes.Rachel NichollsChesterfield, Derbyshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

My sister Diana was stillborn; 44 years later I still miss her. People may say that I never knew her, but I spent nine months or so next to her in the womb – there is no closer bond. It was not until I was 18 and discovered Joan Woodward’s book The Lone Twin and began talking to other twins who had lost a twin at birth that I began to understand all the ways in which I had been grieving for her throughout my childhood. We may not consciously remember our twins, but we have a sense of another person there who has now gone. Attachment issues are common. I would ask anyone who parents a child who has lost a twin in this way to be open about it. I was lucky because my parents were open about my sister; I know many who found out by accident and who have struggled with such an important aspect of themselves being hidden from them, as well as a sense of things falling into place. People from multiple births have a different experience from those who were alone in the womb.

However, Jacob Rees-Mogg’s analogy to the game during a recent on-street interview with Nick Watt of BBC Two’s Newsnight programme either betrayed that he was no devotee of the game or, perhaps, that he was subtly betraying his esteemed leader. He said that Boris Johnson’s reaction to Partygate could be compared to a batsman, given out by the on-pitch umpire, turning to the DRS (decision review system) – an honest disagreement. But if that were the case and the DRS showed him to be out, the batsman would not be at liberty to announce: “This was all a jolly rotten misunderstanding, but I’ll just continue batting.” The image on the big screen would twirl around a couple of times, and then announce “OUT!” in very large letters.

4/23/2022,"For Joe Biden, the vote by Florida Republicans on Thursday to strip Disney of its self-governing powers was a step too far. “Christ, they’re going after Mickey Mouse,” the president exclaimed at a fundraiser in Oregon, in apparent disbelief that state governor Ron DeSantis’s culture wars had reached the gates of the Magic Kingdom. The move, Biden asserted, reflected his belief that the “far right has taken over the party”. By voting to penalize Florida’s largest private employer, lawmakers followed DeSantis’s wishes in securing revenge on a company he brands as “woke” for its opposition to his “don’t say gay” law. DeSantis is a likely candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. He has pushed his legislature on several right-wing laws in recent weeks, including a 15-week abortion ban, stripping Black voters of congressional representation and preventing discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity issues in schools. “This is not your father’s Republican party,” Biden said at the fundraiser. “It’s not even conservative in a traditional sense of conservatism. It’s mean, it’s ugly. Look at what’s happening in Florida: Christ, they’re going after Mickey Mouse.” Analysts are still grappling with the likely effects of yesterday’s Disney vote, which will disband an entity officially known as the Reedy Creek improvement district. The body, which was approved by Florida legislators in 1967, gives Disney autonomous powers, including generating its own tax revenue and self-governance as it built its hugely popular theme parks. Ending the 55-year agreement, Democrats says, will leave local residents on the hook for the functions Reedy Creek was responsible for paying for, including police and fire services, and road construction and maintenance. State senator Gary Farmer, a vocal opponent of DeSantis, said families in Orange and Osceola counties that straddle the 25,000-acre Disney World resort could each face property tax rises of $2,200 annually to cover the shortfall. His claim is so far unsubstantiated. Republicans, meanwhile, have been unable to point to any financial advantage to the state, and appear to be relying instead on the political argument that the concept of the “special taxing district” was outdated and in need of reform. “Aside from maybe taking away the company’s ability to build a nuclear plant, we have yet to hear how this benefits Florida, and especially the local residents in any way,” Nick Papantonis, a reporter who covers Disney for Orlando’s WFTV, said in a Twitter analysis. “The residents, by the way, had no say in this vote, no say in their property taxes going through the roof, and no desire to have their communities staring at financial ruin.” If in practice DeSantis’s goal is to punish Disney, some say the move could backfire, at least financially. Reedy Creek’s abolition on 1 June next year would give it an immediate tax break. The $163m it taxes itself annually to pay for service and pay off debt becomes the responsibility of the county taxpayers. “The moment that Reedy Creek doesn’t exist is the moment that those taxes don’t exist,” the Orange county tax collector Scott Randolph, a Democrat, told WFTV. “[And] Orange county can’t just slap a new taxing district onto that area and recoup the money that was lost.” Most of Disney’s estimated 77,000 cast members, as its workers are known, also live in those two counties, so would effectively end up paying their employer’s taxes as well as their own, critics say. Disney has so far remained silent, its most recent comment on the entire affair being the hard-hitting statement that upset DeSantis in the first place. The company, which has a notably diverse cast, promised to work to overturn the “don’t say gay” law, and added it was halting all political donations. Disney contributed almost $1m to the Republican party of Florida in 2020, and $50,000 directly to DeSantis, records show. Whatever it decides to do, Disney has options. In a probably tongue-in-cheek offer, the Colorado governor Jared Polis is offering “asylum” to Mickey Mouse in his state. But he was critical of DeSantis’s stance. “Florida’s authoritarian socialist attacks on the private sector are driving businesses away. In CO, we don’t meddle in affairs of companies like Disney or Twitter. Hey @Disney we’re ready for Mountain Disneyland,” he said in a tweet. Legal challenges are expected once DeSantis signs the Reedy Creek abolition into law, and Republicans point out they could revisit the issue next year before it takes effect. Democrats are dismissive: “Let’s call this what it is, it’s the punitive, petulant political payback to a corporation who dared to say the emperor has no clothes, but if they behave this next election cycle, maybe we’ll put it back together,” Farmer, the state senator, said. Some political analysts, meanwhile, believe DeSantis is walking a tightrope. “The base is demanding of the Republican party these culture war elements, at least that’s what these politicians are thinking so they’re using these attacks on ‘woke’ corporations as a way of energizing their base so they can win in 2022 and 2024,” Charles Zelden, professor of humanities and politics at Nova Southeastern University and a longtime Florida Disney watcher, told the Guardian. “The downside is it’s bringing them into conflict with corporations they had a very comfortable relationship with for a lot of years, who have donated a lot of money to their campaigns.”",News/US news,Biden: Republicans’ Disney vote shows ‘far right has taken over party’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/biden-desantis-florida-republicans-disney
4/23/2022,"We can’t know for certain how long Boris Johnson will survive as prime minister or whether his departure is indeed, as one of his ministers whispers, “a matter of when, not if”. But there are two things we do know, because they are true right now. We saw vivid evidence of both this week. The first is that his authority is shot. The second is that his continued presence in office is already corroding and corrupting our democratic system, and that this is not a hypothetical threat awaiting us in the future. It is already here. The proof of his vanished authority came 13 minutes before MPs were due to debate a Labour motion to investigate Johnson on the gravely serious charge of deliberately misleading parliament. Johnson and his team had hoped to order Tory MPs to block it, or at least to delay it. But too many Conservatives refused to do as they were told. They didn’t fancy going into the next election with their faces on opposition leaflets, alongside a reminder that they had voted to cover up Johnson’s lies about partying during lockdown. Downing Street was late getting that message. So late that, with just minutes to go, it had to back down and let Labour have its way. This, remember, is the new, supposedly streamlined No 10 operation installed by Johnson to replace the previous crowd, who with Johnson at the helm turned the seat of government into a frat house during the first phase of the pandemic. It seems incompetence and lack of nous – starting with the most elementary political skill, namely an ability to count – have been restored to Downing Street. Remember, too, that this is a government that won an 80-seat majority a little over two years ago. Yet now it cannot rely on its own MPs to do its bidding. And so, on Thursday, it had to watch as Labour took back control. The loss of authority stretches far beyond Westminster. A YouGov poll this week found that 78% of Britons believe Johnson has lied over Partygate. Even among Tory voters, only 17% say he’s told the truth. It seems laughable to speak of “moral authority” and “Boris Johnson” in the same sentence, but it is now plain that the prime minister has none. Of course, there are some who still credit Johnson with Houdini powers of escapology. They look to next month’s local elections and suspect that Johnson’s critics have erred by prophesying a Tory wipeout. Anything less than that, and the PM will boast of his resilience in defiance of the “gloomsters”. They note, too, that the Commons investigation by the privileges committee could stretch into the autumn, buying the PM precious time. But there are plenty of Conservatives, not all of them longtime enemies of the PM, who believe that “the dial has shifted”, that the Johnson premiership is now in a state of irreversible decay. A tremor went through many with Thursday’s declaration by Steve Baker that “the gig is up”. It’s not just that Baker is a strident Brexiter: others of that affiliation have abandoned Johnson already, most notably David Davis with his “In the name of God, go” speech in January. No, what matters about Baker is not what he said, but what he might do. “He’s the most lethal organiser,” says one Commons colleague. He won’t be satisfied with a simple statement of withdrawn support for Johnson. “He’ll be installing the telephones.” Add to that the prospect of more fixed-penalty notices – with reports late Friday that a new batch of fines has started to land in Downing Street inboxes – and, as one Tory MP puts it, leaked photographs of the PM “dancing on the Downing Street photocopier”, and they remain convinced that Johnson’s removal is only a matter of time. Conservatives had been banking on there being no more fines between now and local election day. The Metropolitan police said on Thursday that, helpfully, it would announce no such sanctions until after 5 May. That rather astonishing policy may now be unravelling, but it points to the second political certainty, one that awaits no further confirmation but which is already established: that this scandal and Johnson’s refusal to leave Downing Street are corroding our system of government. In a healthy democracy, the police would investigate lockdown parties in Downing Street the same way they investigate any other crime. But that is not what has happened. As Adam Wagner, a barrister who has become a specialist on Covid rules, puts it: “Why has the schedule of this investigation been so heavily influenced by what is convenient to the government?” The pattern is striking, starting with the initial Met refusal to investigate Downing Street parties at all, a position only reversed after a legal challenge. Then came the decision not to interview those involved, instead merely presenting them with a questionnaire. “Everything they’ve done has made it look like special treatment,” Wagner tells me. To be sure, police guidance suggests officers should avoid doing anything that might “affect or influence the outcome of [an] election”, but a few pages later that same guidance makes the obvious point that “delaying an announcement could itself influence the political outcome”. The Met could have gone either way. It decided to go with the course of action most favourable to the government. The charitable reading is that all of these decisions – including the initial one, taking on trust Downing Street’s insistence that no rules had been broken, and therefore concluding no police investigation was necessary – arose because the police, in Wagner’s words, “were not prepared for a situation where the government itself was the lawbreaker”. It’s the same problem with the ministerial code, which, custom demands, is enforced by the prime minister. All of these conventions are predicated on an assumption that the PM obeys the rules and the law. None of that works when a man such as Johnson sits at the apex of our system. On the contrary, his presence there is exposing the fatal flaw in what Peter Hennessy calls the “good chaps theory of government”, the same flaw that Donald Trump revealed in the US constitution: it is not equipped for a bad chap and a party that remains loyal to him. Every day that Johnson stays, his presence contaminates essential parts of the democratic body politic, the rot spreading through our institutions. Confidence in the police will sink lower: they’ve made themselves look politically partisan. Thanks to them, faith in the even-handedness of the law is diminished. One minister wonders if civil servants are continuing to work from home in part because they are demoralised: they work for a government whose consuming purpose has become nothing more than “the survival of Boris Johnson”. We don’t need to play the Westminster guessing game about any of this. This damage has already been done. There is something rotten in the state of Britain – and its name is Boris Johnson.

4/23/2022,"With impeccable timing I managed to get Covid just a few weeks after the government announced that as far as it was concerned the pandemic was over. So, no more press conferences, no more nightly death totals on the news bulletins. From now on we are all on our own, which is why I never bothered to confirm my lateral flow test with a PCR or register my infection online. The illness itself was not too bad. Hacking cough, flu-like symptoms, confined to bed for several days and brain fog. Certainly a lot less severe than many people I know who have had it. Though not as mild as my 98-year-old mother, who has just shrugged off Covid like a gentle cold for the second time. She’s made of stronger stuff. Still, good to know that Sajid Javid thinks Covid is over. For much of Spurs’ season I’ve managed my expectations. I never really believed our new manager, Antonio Conte, was a miracle worker and thought it inevitable he would quit in the summer once he realised how deep-rooted the club’s problems were. So I was quite relaxed when Spurs fell into the habit of winning one game and losing the next. My one regret was that during January and February I invariably went to see the losses. Watching Tottenham lose to Chelsea three times in as many weeks was a mental scar too far. Then a weird thing happened. Spurs bought two players – Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski – who could actually play. We started not just winning but also playing attractive football. A place in the top four of the Premier League became ours to lose. I started to get nervous. This was a vertigo moment. Sure enough, Spurs chose last Saturday’s home game against Brighton to play their worst match of the season. In a fairer world the club would pay the fans to watch that rubbish. I left the ground with a familiar sense of despair. The next few weeks are going to be trying. Over lunch, a friend, who is a George Orwell expert, drew my attention to a few items in his possession. The first was a letter sent by Orwell in 1936 to a Michael Fraenkel, asking for a copy of his new book, Bastard Death, which he had heard was reminiscent of Henry Miller (a writer whom Orwell much admired), so he could review it for the New English Weekly. The review was less than enthusiastic, with Orwell saying he found Bastard Death almost unintelligible. “It was hardly a novel at all,” he wrote. Rather it was a series of paragraphs with no very apparent connection. However, the review prompted Orwell to write another letter to Fraenkel – also in my friend’s hands – to explain his critique. “I would have written earlier to thank you for your book,” he wrote. “I am sorry to say that I did not understand very much of it. I am afraid it is above my head, but I’m going to have another go and see if I understand it better on a second reading.” He concluded by advising Fraenkel to write to the New English Weekly saying that Orwell had not done the book justice and asking for a second review. So far, so a bit embarrassing. But the killer item in my friend’s possession is the inscribed copy of Bastard Death Fraenkel had sent to Orwell. It is almost pristine. So much so that it’s clear Orwell never got more than a third of the way through – at best – as many of the later pages have not been cut open. So much for giving Bastard Death a second reading. Orwell didn’t even give it a first reading. And the towering conscience of his generation might possibly have written reviews of books he hadn’t read. You would have thought Boris Johnson, aka The Convict, might be quite good at apologising. After all, he’s had a lot to say sorry for: to wives, family, friends, colleagues and the country. Now he finds himself having to apologise for his criminality. And doubtless will again when he inevitably receives further fixed-penalty notices for more egregious breaches of the law. But though Johnson has improved a little bit in the delivery, he still couldn’t manage to sound entirely sincere when he apologised to the Commons on Tuesday. And he couldn’t bring himself to admit he had knowingly misled MPs. What’s more, the repentance was only skin deep. As soon as he was away from the Commons chamber he went off to address Tory MPs at the 1922 Committee. There, by all accounts, he was a lot more bullish, minimising his conviction and laying into the BBC and the Church of England for not being more complimentary about his Rwanda refugee policy. By Wednesday, he had moved on to instructing the paymaster general, Michael Ellis, to dream up a wrecking amendment to delay any parliamentary inquiry into claims he misled MPs, only to have to fold when the whips told him they couldn’t guarantee MPs would back the amendment. Liam Gallagher has told Mojo magazine that he is in constant pain from acute arthritis in both hips. Doctors apparently told the former Oasis singer that he needed both hips replaced but Gallagher, 49, says he would rather endure the pain and be in a wheelchair than risk dying under anaesthetic. This seems a bit extreme: hip replacement surgery is classified as a routine procedure with good outcomes. Yet part of me sort of understands, not because I might croak but because the benefits are oversold. I’d had a bad knee since my teens and had had many operations, including a bone graft. By my early 50s I was in constant pain and the surgeon said I was out of options. But not to worry, he said, the whole thing would be a breeze and I’d be up and about in no time. With any luck I’d even be able to play tennis again. Only it wasn’t quite like that. The op itself was something of a doddle, but the recovery was anything but. It took months of hard physio before I could walk vaguely normally and I have never been able to exercise properly again. The whole process really took it out of me and I said that if my other knee gave out I would stick with the pain for as long as possible. More than 10 years on I haven’t changed my mind.

4/23/2022,"The far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene appeared in court in Georgia on Friday for a hearing in an attempt to bar her from Congress for aiding the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. The effort, brought by a coalition of voters and liberal groups, to bar Greene comes under the 14th amendment to the US constitution. Passed after the civil war, it was written to prevent anyone from sitting in Congress if they have “engaged in insurrection or rebellion” against the constitution “or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof”. Some people in the room in Atlanta cheered and applauded as Greene took her seat. As the hearing began, Greene tweeted: “Only the People have the right to choose who they send to Congress.” Matt Gaetz of Florida, another far-right Republican congressman and prominent Donald Trump supporter, was also pictured in the room, and tweeted: “I’m here in Atlanta to support ⁦[Greene] against the assault on democracy that is this effort to remove her from the ballot.” Supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol in an attempt to stop certification of his defeat by Joe Biden, an attack mounted in service of the 45th president’s lies about electoral fraud. A bipartisan Senate committee connected seven deaths to the riot. More than 100 law enforcement officers were hurt. About 800 people, including members of far-right and militia groups, have been charged, some with seditious conspiracy. A House investigation continues. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection, but acquitted when Senate Republicans stayed loyal. Organisers of events in Washington on January 6 have said Greene communicated with them. Greene has denied such links, and said she does not encourage violence. In October, however, she told a podcast hosted by Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist: “January 6 was just a riot at the Capitol and if you think about what our Declaration of Independence says, it says to overthrow tyrants.” After the riot, Greene was one of 147 Republicans in Congress who went ahead with objections to results in battleground states. An effort to use the 14th amendment against Madison Cawthorn, a Trump ally from North Carolina, was unsuccessful, after a judge ruled an 1872 civil war amnesty law was not merely retroactive. In Greene’s case, a federal judge said the 1872 law did not apply. The hearing opened with a presentation in Greene’s defence, and extensive questioning from her opponents of a historian about what the 14th amendment means and about past rebellions, including the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, which was quashed by George Washington.",News/US news,Marjorie Taylor Greene appears in court over attempt to bar her from Congress,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/22/marjorie-taylor-greene-court-congress-capitol-attack
4/23/2022,"An embargo on Russian gas imports triggered by a further escalation of the war in Ukraine could plunge Germany into a recession, the Bundesbank warned on Friday, but Europe’s largest economy would probably shrink less severely than during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic. An immediate EU ban on Russian gas would cost Germany the equivalent of €165bn (£138bn) in lost output this year, according to the country’s central bank. “In the severe crisis scenario, real GDP in the current year would fall by almost 2% compared to 2021,” the Bundesbank said in its latest monthly report. Germany’s manufacturing-heavy economy would feel the painful consequences of gas-shortages for the coming years, the bank’s report said. “In addition, the inflation rate would be significantly higher for a longer period of time.” Before the start of the war in Ukraine, Russian natural gas accounted for 55% of Germany’s gas needs, with roughly a third used for industrial production, including steel and chemicals. “Natural gas prices are likely to rise the most, as Russian deliveries are difficult to replace in the short term,” the bank said. However, in a heated German debate over the economic price the country should be prepared to pay to help cut off financial support for Putin’s war economy, some have taken the Bundesbank report as positive news. “The economic slump would with high probability be less severe than during the corona crisis,” wrote conservative broadsheet Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. “It puts even more pressure on the government to justify itself”. Germany’s GDP slumped by 4.6% in the first year of the pandemic, with a sharp recession ending a 10-year run of growth. The German economy recovered in 2021, growing by 2.9%. While the European Union has already banned Russian coal and is preparing an embargo on its oil, plans for a gas boycott have stalled in part due to the concerns of Germany, which has warned that a recession on its own terrain could have devastating knock-on effects across the European Union. Germany’s economy minister, Robert Habeck, has predicted “mass unemployment, poverty, people who can’t heat their homes, people who run out of petrol” if his country stopped using Russian oil and gas. Critics say the German government’s fears are based on political gut instincts and doomsday warnings of industrial lobbyists rather than concrete economic models.",News/Business,"Ban on Russian gas would plunge Germany into recession, warns Bundesbank",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/22/russian-gas-ban-germany-recession-bundesbank
4/23/2022,"It was called the Intelligence Factory: a warren of rooms and offices in which, by the end of the war, thousands of people worked round the clock decoding and processing enemy communications. Block A at Bletchley Park, the top secret second world war code-breaking centre in Buckinghamshire that was the forerunner of GCHQ, has been restored and opens to the public for the first time on Thursday. Using testimonies from veterans, surviving documents and photographs, and interactive reconstructions, the exhibition shows the industrial scale of the operation that was critical to the allied victory. Block A opened in late 1942, built to house the ever-expanding number of people needed to decode, analyse and process a growing mountain of war communications. Bletchley Park bosses scrambled to recruit more and more people – 75% of them women, many in their late teens or early 20s, mostly doing tedious, repetitive tasks in conditions of extreme secrecy. By the end of 1945, almost 9,000 people were working three shifts a day at Bletchley. They were billeted with local residents, or housed in specially constructed huts containing rows of camp beds, and fed canteen meals of mince and potatoes or corned beef with prunes. On arrival, all had to sign a document headed “Secrecy”, which instructed them to never talk about their work at meals, on transport or even “by your own fireside”. It warned: “There is nothing to be gained by chatter but the satisfaction of idle vanity, or idle curiosity: there is everything to be lost.” For most, it was a far cry from the experience of Alan Turing, the brilliant mathematician who cracked the Enigma code and whose story was told in the Oscar-nominated 2014 film The Imitation Game. “Turing was a genius, who worked largely in intellectual isolation,” said Thomas Cheetham, research officer at Bletchley Park. “In fact, this place was like a factory – busy, bustling, noisy, lots of people doing small tasks. For many, it was their first job – the average age was 19 – and it was quite boring work. And they were never given the big picture of what was being achieved at Bletchley.” The exhibition includes a recreation of the naval plotting room, where the movements of ships and submarines were tracked by pins and string placed in floor-to-ceiling maps. An original Hollerith machine that organised and processed data using 2m individual punch cards every week – a job that today’s computer technology could complete in moments – stands in another room. Pneumatic tubes, known as “spit and suck”, kept vital information flowing around Block A. Its distinctive whooshing sound, along with the clatter of the Hollerith and the general background noise of people working at close quarters, provided a constant soundtrack to the centre. The 24/7 activity was backed up by a gargantuan management operation, with thousands of memos posted on noticeboards. One, dated 16 June 1942, states that “it is NOT permissible to issue second helpings” at mealtimes due to strict rationing. Another, issued on 24 February 1943, advised that “beer will be available daily in Hut 2 (Recreation Hut) between noon and 2pm, and 6pm and 8pm”. Kay Harrison, now 96, who started work at Bletchley Park in June 1944 at the age of 18, said she had no real idea of the significance of the work until much later in her life. “Everything was so secret, and we weren’t allowed to talk about it. Now I know how important it was.” Erica Munro, exhibitions manager, said: “In the intelligence factory, there was a very strong female experience – partly through the sheer numbers, and partly through the variety of work that they were doing. It’s been a pleasure to include so many female voices in audio points through the exhibition.” The importance of Bletchley Park to the overall allied effort was “incalculable”, said Cheetham. “Everybody tried to do signals intelligence. Some countries were very bad at it. The Americans were quite good, but even they didn’t achieve what the British achieved at Bletchley Park: having one central signals intelligence centre that handled everything. Britain was so far ahead.” The Intelligence Factory opens at Bletchley Park on Thursday 28 April.",News/World news,Intelligence Factory exhibition sheds light on secret Bletchley Park operation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/intelligence-factory-exhibition-sheds-light-on-secret-bletchley-park-operation
4/23/2022,"A German investigation into the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann could continue until next year, according to the state prosecutor in the city of Braunschweig. Authorities in Faro, Portugal on Thursday declared convicted rapist Christian Brueckner, 44, an “arguido”, or “formal suspect” – the first time Portuguese authorities have officially identified a suspect in the case since Kate and Gerry McCann, the toddler’s parents, were declared such in 2007. They were formally cleared of suspicion in 2008. Officials in the northern German city of Oldenburg, where Brueckner is serving seven years for raping an American pensioner in 2005 in the same area of Portugal’s Algarve region where Madeleine went missing, confirmed on Friday they had informed the prisoner of his new status. However, the state prosecutor in Braunschweig, Hans Christian Wolters, who has been investigating Brueckner over Madeleine McCann’s disappearance and four other alleged offences since 2020, said the news from Portugal was unlikely to be indicative of a breakthrough in the 15-year case. “We note the announcement from Faro, but it does not affect our own work in a significant way”, Wolters told the Guardian. Asked if it was possible that Brückner was about to be charged in Portugal and could be extradited there from Germany, Wolters said he believed it was “rather unlikely there will be an indictment in Portugal”. The 15th anniversary of three-year-old Madeleine McCann’s disappearance from her bed in a holiday apartment at a resort in Praia da Luz approaches on 3 May this year, and Portugal has a 15-year statute of limitations for crimes with a maximum prison sentence of 10 years or more. Wolters said the “arguido” classification “appears to have a procedural background in Portugal”. “A statute of limitations can be avoided that way.” Brueckner’s lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, told German newspaper Bild that the Portuguese decision was a “procedural trick”. German police said in June 2020 that Madeleine was assumed dead and that Brueckner, 44, was likely responsible for it. However, British officers continue to treat it as a missing persons case, and her parents “still hope” Madeleine is alive. Germany, unlike Portugal, does not have a statute of limitations for murder, and the state prosecutor in Braunschweig is currently investigating Brueckner for five separate alleged offences. They include three cases of rape and two cases of child molestation, the most recent being an incident in 2017 where Brueckner is alleged to have exposed himself and masturbated in front of a group of children. Wolters told the Guardian that his office would make an announcement regarding the next step towards a possible prosecution at the end of May, but “the end of our investigations into the McCann case is not yet in sight” and could continue into 2023. If Brueckner was charged over the other alleged offences in Germany, likely to be at the end of the summer or in early autumn, he would need to either personally consent to do so or the prosecution would need to reissue extradition papers from Italy, where the suspect was last arrested in September 2018 – a process that could take between two weeks and several months. If the suspect in the McCann case was to be charged in Portugal after all, Portuguese authorities would need to take the same bureaucratic step. Different national prosecutors in Europe can investigate criminal offences in parallel, though legal agreements in the EU are designed to avoid individuals being charged over the same crimes more than once.",News/UK news,Madeleine McCann: German investigation of disappearance could last until next year,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/madeleine-mccann-german-investigation-of-disappearance-could-last-until-next-year
4/23/2022,"The secretive world of superyachts is the ultimate in billionaire excess, where tycoons cavort with celebrities, politicians and sex workers, and where privacy is protected by non-disclosure agreements ensuring absolute discretion from well-paid staff. Insider accounts are rare, but as owners and their crew come under scrutiny like never before after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a captain who has worked for some of the wealthiest boat owners has come forward to share details of his 15 years at sea. His account is of a world that is both showy and shadowy, with weekly food orders worth more than €40,000 (£33,000) flown in from Paris, expensive morning-after clean-ups to remove traces of party drugs, and what he sees as an ingrained culture of prostitution and sexism. The captain, who has sailed throughout the Caribbean and Mediterranean yacht hotspots, said he wanted to highlight how rich owners – and particularly Russians – hide behind a “mess of shell companies” in secrecy jurisdictions such as the Marshall Islands or the Cayman Islands. As western allies have curbed the financial freedoms of oligarchs who surround Vladimir Putin with sanctions, yachts have become key targets. Among those impounded are the 86-metre Amore Vero, which French authorities believe belongs to Igor Sechin, head of the Rosneft oil company, and the 156-metre Dilbar, thought to be owned by metals billionaire Alisher Usmanov (although both have denied ownership). “They’re operated in a super-secretive way so they can use them and deflect attention from the ownership,” said the captain, who asked to remain anonymous because he had signed confidentiality agreements. He said he had not worked on any of the seized yachts. In some cases non-disclosure agreements are mandatory to even interview for a job, he said. The Guardian was shown examples of actual yacht employment contracts: one contains detailed clauses forever barring the disclosure of any information about the identities of the owner or any guests – specifically including references to business documents, photographs and even drawings of the boat. Posting photographs of the yacht on social media can be a firing offence, and talking to the media is strictly forbidden. Another contract shows employees must consent to polygraph lie detector tests if required. There is good reason, said the captain: normal laws often do not seem to apply on these floating palaces . He said deep cleaning to remove traces of drugs such as cocaine can be a regular requirement, particularly when moving from one European territory to another where customs officials can insist on spot checks. The extent of prostitution is an open secret, he claimed, with women regularly transported to boats. The industry is “very sexist and ageist and racist”. He suggested non-white crew or those from poorer countries have little chance of being hired, and female staff are usually required to send full-length profile photos to prospective employers. Friends and former colleagues working on several other boats have reported that female crew members are forced to test regularly for sexually transmitted diseases. Some specific yacht users are known to regularly exchange sex for gifts such as luxury watches. “It’s the norm in the industry,” the captain said. “The owners want to hook up with the stewardesses. It’s quite crazy, and disgusting.” Yet every summer flocks of young people head to the world’s superyacht hotspots – places such as Antibes, Palma de Mallorca or Fort Lauderdale – to do the “dock walk”: stopping at every big boat along the marina and asking for work. They end up serving the guests or endlessly cleaning salt water from every window. A life of sun, sea and high pay is the reward. Even junior deck hands with little experience pocket €2,500 a month – an attractive salary when room and board are included, and when maritime loopholes mean earnings can be tax free. Senior crew can earn many times that: some of most prized chefs have been known to earn €25,000 a month, while some captains of the biggest yachts – overseeing a staff of as many as 80 – can earn as much as €40,000 a month. “The billionaires, it’s their toy,” the captain said. “The money is just a number to them at the end of the day. They’ll pay crazy amounts just to make it work.” Below Deck, a reality TV show that started in 2013 (and given a second lease of life by internet streaming), depicts an industry of party animals working through constant hangovers, and that does happen on many boats, the captain acknowledged. Yet at the top end that lifestyle is not tolerated. “Below Deck gives everybody a funny spin on how it is,” said the captain. “My crew are calm and do healthy hobbies.” The sanctions on Russian yacht owners mean unprecedented upheaval at the top end of the industry, but there have been only occasional public signs of crew turning against owners – in part because of fear for their careers. “We all do recognise how much of a conflict of interest it is, and it shouldn’t exist,” the captain said. “It’s crazy how it does and it goes unregulated.”",News/News,"Secrecy, sex and sun: captain reveals life aboard superyachts",https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/apr/22/secrecy-sex-and-sun-captain-reveals-life-aboard-superyachts

4/23/2022,"Declan Rice has turned down a third offer of a new contract from West Ham and is open to a summer transfer. The midfielder has no intention of extending his stay on the terms being offered but understands that the club do not want to sell and will not allow his commitment or professionalism to drop. A number of clubs including Manchester United are interested in Rice but West Ham’s manager, David Moyes, said this month that “£150 million just now would be the minimum, but he is not for sale. What I do know is that it means there are only certain clubs that could even consider it.” United would not pay that for the 23-year-old, even though he is their No 1 target in that position. Chelsea have a longstanding interest but their transfer policy will be shaped by the new owners and although Manchester City want a midfielder it will be difficult for them to consider Rice if they land Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund in another costly deal.

4/23/2022,"Of all the late 90s and 2000s cultural phenomena to come under recent scrutiny – the Pam and Tommy sex tape, Woodstock 99, Abercrombie & Fitch, over-inflated Silicon Valley startups, Britney Spears, Janet Jackson’s “wardrobe malfunction” – Girls Gone Wild is arguably the least surprisingly toxic. Started in 1997 by a fratty entrepreneur named Joe Francis, Girls Gone Wild sold VHS and then DVD videos of co-ed women, almost always intoxicated, baring their breasts on some hedonistic spring break trip in exchange for free underwear or hats. Francis dominated the soft-core porn market in the early internet days; millions of people purchased footage of the girls – often barely over 18 and sometimes younger, predominantly white, thin and blonde – getting badgered by cameramen to take more shots, take their tops off, make out with their friends, use sex toys on themselves. Obviously, this has not aged well. (Nor was it without controversy at the time.) The anything-goes raunch and eye-popping infomercials also (barely) masked something much more sinister and damaging, according to a new documentary, Girls Gone Wild Exposed. The 84-minute film, part of TNT’s Rich and Shameless anthology, digs into the queasy popularity of Girls Gone Wild and assembles a deluge of evidence suggesting that Francis, a fixture of mid-aughts gossip blogs, was a serial physical and emotional abuser. “Behind the fun and the wet T-shirt competitions and this sort of faux feminist liberation – flashing your breasts for the camera – lives were being ruined,” the film’s director, Katinka Blackford Newman, told the Guardian. “And there are people whose lives are still being impacted.” As the film recounts through in-person interviews with former Girls Gone Wild producers and staff and copious footage, the tapes themselves were dubiously sourced and financed. They featured girls, sometimes underage and manipulated into commercial releases while drunk, performing sexual acts on themselves or each other under blatant pressure from Francis. Some, such as Nichole, who appears in the documentary, did not even know she was being taped. Another participant, Tabitha, says she was 17 and drunk when she was talked into a wet T-shirt contest; five years later, she found herself an unwitting poster girl of Girls Gone Wild. (Despite years of legal battles, DVDs featuring her are still being sold.) A woman in her mid-30s named Jannel alleges that Francis, whom she trusted because he was a celebrity associated with such figures as Kim Kardashian and Paris Hilton, fed her shots, manipulated her into masturbating on camera, and raped her in the back of the Girls Gone Wild tour bus. (The alleged assault was first reported in a 2006 Los Angeles Times profile in which he also physically assaults the 29-year-old female journalist.) Though she went to police, “nothing to this day has ever been done about it,” Jannel says in the film. Lack of accountability appears to be a running theme for Francis. For years, Francis dodged or settled numerous lawsuits and skipped out of jail time for a misdemeanor assault and false imprisonment conviction in Los Angeles by fleeing to his resort home in Mexico. (Those charges, for which he was found guilty in 2013, stem from a 2011 incident in which he met three recent college graduates at a bar, took them to his Bel-Air home, prevented them from leaving his vehicle, grabbed one girl’s hair and throat and slammed her head on the floor.) “He slipped under the radar of the #MeToo movement, because he has been irrelevant for quite some time,” said Blackford Newman. “Of course, his legacy lives on in the lives that he’s ruined, the women whose images he stole, either by filming them without their permission or getting them blind drunk and persuading them to take part in seedy sex scenes without payment.” The allegations are not all from the Girls Gone Wild days; the film opens with a disturbing audio recording from August 2020 by his ex-wife, Abbey Wilson, in which she screams in terror as Francis apparently attacks and chokes her; when Wilson screams “You’re killing me,” Francis replies: “Good. I hope you fucking die.” (The film states that Wilson “has not objected” to use of the recording.) Francis was arrested in Mexico and spent 73 days in jail on domestic violence charges. The documentary attempts to make sense of Francis’s apparent violent streak. Raised in Laguna Beach, Francis supposedly did not have a happy home life with his three sisters and parents. (His family, who later took out restraining orders against him, declined to participate in the film). By high school, he attended a correctional boarding school in Idaho that was later shuttered under allegations of abuse. Francis first got his start in television in the mid-90s, working as a production assistant for Real TV, a syndicated show of home-video bloopers. In 1997, he released Banned from Television, a collection of material cut from Real TV for being too graphic or violent. (In 2000, a fellow Real TV producer sued Francis for breach of implied contract, breach of confidence and unjust enrichment. The two sides settled for an undisclosed sum.) A year later, he narrowed focus with the first Girls Gone Wild video. Within two years, it had made $20m in revenue. By 2003, there were 83 different titles and 4.5m Girls Gone Wild videos sold – exploiting women in the name of empowerment, wrapped up in first amendment rights. The now 49-year-old businessman cultivated what former E! host Brooke Burke describes in a sit-down interview as a “lovable bad boy” image. Francis declined to participate in Blackford Newman’s documentary – in emails included in the film, he claimed there was another project in production and that they would “have to agree to the terms that have been provided” for him to appear on camera. “I understand that was complete bullshit,” said Blackford Newman. “He basically wanted editorial control,” which was “something we were never going to agree to”. Joe Francis and Girls Gone Wild may be culturally irrelevant in 2022, but “the lessons we learn from his story are hugely relevant”, said Blackford Newman. “There will always be sleazy abusers and predators like Joe Francis. The question is, how did he get away with it?” Blackford Newman, bolstered by a seemingly endless camera roll of Francis at red carpets and Hollywood events, largely blames the sheen of legitimacy provided by his celebrity circuit, including Hilton, the Kardashians (Francis briefly dated Kourtney before she was with Scott Disick), and Mario Lopez. Francis was “celebrity-washed”, said Blackford Newman. “He was given credibility by his celebrity friends who turned a blind eye.” The film particularly zeroes in on his connection to the Kardashians and especially Kim Kardashian, whose celebrity dovetailed with Francis’s in the mid-2000s. (Francis allegedly helped Kardashian broker a deal with Vivid Entertainment to net $4.5m from her leaked sex tape.) The documentary includes a scene from an early season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians in which Francis phones Kris Jenner from jail in Reno, Nevada, for tax evasion. “Oh my gosh, Joe! We need to come get you out,” Jenner says. Kardashian, in another clip, wears a “Free Joe” shirt before paparazzi cameras. “I feel like I love Joe and his situation is unfortunate. And he should be free … I’m a Joe supporter,” she says. It’s unclear when the clip was filmed; Francis served time in 2007 in Panama City, Florida, for contempt of court in a civil case involving the filming of underage girls, and later 11 months in Reno for tax evasion. He also pleaded no contest in Panama City for prostitution and child abuse for filming two 17-year-olds in a shower and paying their friends to masturbate him; he received credit for time served in Reno and was set free. “The guy was in jail facing charges of child pornography and underage sex. These were serious charges,” said Blackford Newman of the Kardashians’ support. “They knew what was going on, but somehow he managed to charm them.” The friendship appears to have continued until at least 2016, when Kim vacationed at his 40,000-sq-ft resort property in Mexico, Casa Aramara, with her children. (Casa Aramara also hosted part of Kardashian and Kanye West’s honeymoon in 2014, Mario Lopez’s wedding and Kylie Jenner’s 18th birthday vacation in 2015.) Blackford Newman hopes the film will serve as a “wake-up call to celebrities like the Kardashians to be more accountable, and to understand that they have a responsibility”. By associating with Francis, known to film underage girls, “they’re giving them credibility, particularly in the eyes of younger impressionable women”. The film-making team, according to Blackford Newman, approached about 100 of Francis’s celebrity friends, including all of his Kardashian associates, for comment. All declined. According to the film, Francis remains free in Mexico, unable to return to California without risking jail time for his misdemeanor assault conviction in 2013. For now, there is little movement for legal or financial accountability. Still, “I hope that the film will encourage other survivors of shameful and abusive behavior to have the courage to speak up,” said Blackford Newman, “no matter how rich or famous their abusers are.” Rich & Shameless: The Dark Side of the Girls Gone Wild Empire airs on TNT on 23 April with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,‘Lives were being ruined’: the dark history of Girls Gone Wild,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/22/joe-francis-girls-gone-wild-documentary
4/23/2022,"There is no shortage of art’s big beasts in Venice, as the world’s most prestigious international art event, the city’s biennale, opens to the public. Georg Baselitz has made works to hang in the 18th-century stucco frames that once held portraits of the Grimani family in their palazzo. Marc Quinn is showing in the National Archaeological Museum. Anselm Kiefer has covered the walls of a colossal room in the Palazzo Ducale with paintings encrusted with shoes, clothing, metal, and even a ladder. Arguably, though, the dominant spirit of the event lies beyond these impressively housed exhibitions. In the main venues of the biennale – the city’s Giardini and Arsenale – the overwhelming feeling is not of the lone, male, white artist. Instead, for the first time, female artists outnumber men – and by a ratio of roughly nine to one. Of the more than 200 artists the curator Cecilia Alemani is showing in her huge main exhibition, the vast majority are women. One of her venues, the international pavilion of the Giardini, contains no male artists at all, only women and a small number of non-binary and transgender artists. “I have always worked with many women artists – and I think some of the most talented artists working today are women,” the Italian, US-based curator said. Historically, about 10% of artists in the main exhibition have tended to be women, rising to 30% in recent years; in 2019, the UK-based curator Ralph Rugoff’s exhibition achieved a rough parity for the first time. Alemani’s show is approximately 90% women. “I don’t care about quotas,” she added, “but it’s striking that people are obsessing about my exhibition and never found the dominance of men [in previous editions] shocking.” Characteristic of the biennale’s atmosphere is, for example, the Polish pavilion: the Roma artist Małgorzata Mirga-Tas has covered the walls of the structure with tapestry-like patchworks, partly based on frescoes in the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara, that pay homage to individual pioneering Roma women. Next door to the Polish pavilion, Alina Pintilie’s talked-about Romanian pavilion, and her cast of collaborators, whom she called “wonderful, brave, soul searchers”, including gay, trans, and disabled people, are challenging normative views of relationships, the body and intimacy. In her film work You Are Another Me – Cathedral of the Body she was interested, she said, in “opening up different ways of relating to different bodies, different beauties”. Black women occupy some of the most prominent national pavilions: the sculptor Simone Leigh for the US; Sonia Boyce for Great Britain; and Zineb Sedira, who is of Algerian descent, for France. Sedira, whose exhibition meditates on the history of Algerian, French and Italian film, said: “I’m a woman artist who works in a male-dominated world. The 1960s and 70s film world was definitely a man’s world. I really wanted to reappropriate that space as a woman, as an Algerian, as a Muslim, as a French, as a British.” Like Boyce’s exhibition, which foregrounds Black female musicians, Sedira’s show is strongly embedded in ideas of friendship. The same is true of Alberta Whittle’s exhibition for Scotland, which reflects on the traumatic history of the slave trade and colonialism between Africa, Scotland and Barbados, where she was born. “I find it interesting that so many of us – Sonia Boyce, Simone Leigh – are members of the West Indian diaspora,” said the Glasgow-based Whittle. “It’s a perspective that has long been ignored.” Tender and touching despite everything, her work is made, said Whittle, “through a spirit of hope and rage”. It was, she said, “a fatiguing position” to be the first Black woman to represent her country, along with Boyce, Leigh, and Sedira. “That said, I feel honoured. It’s like showing my work in the big league.” “The world is awakening and realising that it is finally time,” said Alemani. “I think it’s puzzling that though the American pavilion was built in 1930, and the British pavilion was built in 1912, it has taken until now for Black women to occupy them. But we need to go beyond the shock and use this time to reflect on the past and reinterpret history and understand how we got to this point.” Her exhibition, titled The Milk of Dreams, was “reconsidering the centrality of man, to celebrate a different relationship with the planet and nature and different species,” she said. That involved “decentring the western, usually white male perspective”. She pointed to the work, for example, of the Colombian artist Delcy Morelos, whose work was a discovery for her as she researched her exhibition, and whose large earth “maze” occupies one of the broad spaces of the Arsenale. Morelos’s installation is “infused with tobacco, cocoa powder, cloves”, she explained. “You experience the art with the fullness of the body – something I have missed very much during the pandemic.” The Venice Biennale continues until 27 November.",Arts/Art and design,Venice Biennale: female artists outnumber males for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/apr/22/venice-biennale-female-artists-outnumber-males-for-first-time
