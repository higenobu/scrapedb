3/9/2022,"The economic crime bill being debated today in the House of Lords does not, as the home secretary, Priti Patel, insisted, show Britain’s determination to root out Vladimir Putin’s “mob of oligarchs and kleptocrats”. On the contrary, it demonstrates ingrained complacency towards dirty money that is so complete it begins to resemble complicity. This bill tweaks the sanctions regulations to remove some of the bottlenecks that have made the UK lag behind its allies; and it updates the rules around “unexplained wealth orders”, to fix some of the flaws in the last measure that was supposedly going to tame the oligarchy. What makes the bill important, however, is the fact that it imposes transparency on offshore companies that own property in the UK. This is why the legislation is so urgent it was rushed through the House of Commons in a single day on Monday – a process that would usually take months. If the plans work as intended, oligarchs will no longer be able to anonymously own mansions and estates. Their secrets will be revealed, and they will either scuttle away like cockroaches from an overturned rock, or face prosecution from our brave police officers. Britain will cease to be a willing fence for the stolen wealth of the world; a butler to the Kremlin’s cronies. There is just one problem with the plan, however, which is that – unless some astonishing amendments appear out of nowhere – it’s rubbish. If you’re an oligarch, and you want a completely legal way to avoid the provisions of the bill, own your offshore company in equal shares of 16.67% with five close relatives. That way, none of your shareholders reach the 25% ownership level required to count as the person of “significant control”. Here is another, also completely legal way: own your company via a professional corporate trust provider, who will act as a nominee, and thus be named in your place on the ownership documents. You’re welcome, and I’m not even a lawyer; imagine what a skilled enabler could do with this colander masquerading as a piece of legislation. And here is another, illegal way to evade the new measures: just provide false information. There are no checks on the information that the shell companies’ owners declare, so, if an oligarch was prepared to lie – and, if there’s anything we’ve learned about the Kremlin, it’s that it’s prepared to lie – they could pretend they didn’t own the property at all. This should not be a surprise to the Home Office, because it’s exactly the same loophole that for decades has led to British-registered companies with falsified ownership being used to hide the ownership of billions upon billions of pounds laundered out of Russia Patel appeared to realise that her bill had flaws because, in addressing the Commons on Monday, she spoke almost as much about a second economic crime bill she intends to introduce as she did about this one. She said the government was hurrying this legislation so as to “send a very strong signal that the UK will not be a home for corruption”. To anyone who has been following this issue, however, the signal it sends is exactly the opposite. The British government first promised this very policy on offshore-owned property in 2016, when David Cameron hosted an anti-corruption summit. The necessary legislation was published in 2018, following a full consultation, when Theresa May was prime minister. It has been sitting on a shelf now for almost four years. The need to hurry it through parliament was created solely by the government’s failure to introduce it earlier. Expecting to be congratulated for that is like demanding plaudits for running for the bus because you’ve overslept. If the government actually cared about oligarchs owning Belgravia, rather than about bad headlines, it would have passed this bill – with proper scrutiny – years ago. Of course, if the government does indeed bring in a second, better economic crime bill, as Patel said it would, that’s all for the good. There are, however, reasons to doubt its newfound commitment to this cause. It is less than two months since an actual minister resigned, at the dispatch box in the House of Lords, over the government’s decision not to introduce this same economic crime bill. When in 2016 Scottish MPs drew ministers’ attention to the flaws in the rules around Companies House, and how they had allowed the so-called Moldovan Laundromat to wash dirty cash through Edinburgh-registered limited partnerships, the government’s response was to deregulate further, so as to protect the competitiveness of the City of London. Even if the new measures are introduced, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Serious Fraud Office are still disastrously underfunded, and lack the people, resources or political cover to go after financial criminals wherever and whoever they might be. This new bill does limit the costs that targets of unexplained wealth orders can claim back from the NCA after an unsuccessful filing, but that just restricts how much money it can lose; it doesn’t give it any new resources to fund investigations. Tackling the oligarchs is suddenly urgent because Putin has invaded Ukraine, but when this crisis is over, which hopefully it soon will be, I do not believe Boris Johnson will keep waving this flag. He’s a man who dismissed the intelligence and security committee’s sober warnings about Russian interference as the moans of “Islingtonian remainers”. Would you really bet against the lobbyists for deregulation managing to persuade his government that now is not the time to impose tighter restrictions on property sales or company formations? Overcoming Britain’s willingness to take money from anyone and anywhere will take more than one day’s hurried debate, and I see no sign that this government has even begun to realise the scale of the changes to legislation, enforcement, culture and politics that are required to rid this country of its butlering habit.

3/9/2022,"A British-based video website once called the “far right’s YouTube” has said it will continue to make content available from RT, despite the Kremlin-backed TV channel being removed or blocked by TV broadcasters and rival sites including YouTube. BitChute, a UK-registered video sharing platform (VSP) with British directors that has a global following, said RT, formerly known as Russia Today would remain on its platform as long as it is legally allowed to do so. The company, which has hosted films of terror attacks, antisemitic videos watched by millions and racist killings posted by neo-Nazis, is regulated by broadcasting watchdog Ofcom under a regime established for UK-registered online services from Snapchat and TikTok to OnlyFans. Ray Vahey, the chief executive of BitChute, which was incorporated at Companies House in the UK in 2017, said: “BitChute condemns all wars and acts of aggression, and our prayers go out to all those who have had their lives impacted and lost loved ones during the invasion of Ukraine. “The UK is a country that believes in due process and freedom of expression, and we cannot beat authoritarianism by sacrificing principles. RT will remain on BitChute as long as we can legally host them.” Ofcom has launched 27 investigations into allegations of bias against RT’s news coverage, which culture secretary Nadine Dorries has called “poisonous propaganda”, and has the power to go as far as revoking RT’s licence to broadcast in the UK. RT’s UK TV channel has been unavailable in the UK since last Wednesday after it was removed from Sky, Freeview and Freesat as part of wider European Union sanctions against Russia. Last week, Google-owned YouTube, which is not regulated in the UK, moved to block the channels related to RT and Russian state news agency Sputnik across Europe due to the “ongoing war in Ukraine”. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has also restricted the pages of the two companies across Europe. Under rules implemented two years ago, “UK-established VSPs” must protect users from harmful content, including to “protect the general public from criminal content and material likely to incite violence or hatred”. BitChute is one of 20 companies on Ofcom’s list of VSPs it monitors, but unlike its role in broadcasting regulation, the watchdog does not adjudicate complaints about content on VSPs. In addition, the VSP regime does not cover legal disinformation or propaganda and there are no standards of accuracy, impartiality or offence that VSPs must meet. “UK video platforms must take measures to protect their users from illegal content, but our role is not to assess individual online videos,” said a spokesperson for Ofcom. “We have strict rules to ensure that TV channels are duly accurate and impartial.” The VSP regulations, which are to be superseded by much more stringent rules under the online safety bill, focus on providing guidance only and give companies flexibility to effectively police their own operations. Chris Elmore, Labour’s shadow media minister, said: “While the government goes at a glacial pace to regulate online spaces, lots of high-harm platforms operate with seeming impunity, spreading fake news. “We need tough action to take down RT, Putin’s propaganda factory. While it is off air here due to action in Europe, ministers must press Ofcom to expedite their investigations into the channel and any platforms hosting their content. BitChute should not host RT’s lies and misinformation anywhere.”",News/Business,BitChute website to continue hosting blocked RT channel,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/bitchute-website-continue-hosting-blocked-rt-channel
3/9/2022,"The Irish cabinet has agreed to slash excise duty on petrol from midnight, piling the pressure on the UK chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to follow suit and cut tax on fuel in the UK. At a meeting in Dublin, ministers agreed a 20 cents (17p) cut in tax on unleaded petrol, 15 cents on diesel and 2 cents on agricultural diesel until the end of August. The finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, said: “We are experiencing the consequences of a war. The government is acting now, with this excise measure in response to price rises that we have seen today but also in anticipation of further rises that we do expect to see over the short to medium term.” The Irish government made the decision after stark warnings from experts about the impact Russia-Ukraine war would have on fuel and food security. Donohoe said state resources were limited, indicating a fall in tax revenues would need to be clawed back. With oil prices now at a 14-year high, Sunak is being urged to cut VAT on petrol to ease the pressure on householders and businesses already facing spiralling costs. The average price of a litre of petrol in the UK, already at record levels, rose from 156.4p on Monday to a new high of 158.2p on Tuesday, compared with Ireland where it is around 205c (172p). VAT makes up 16% of the price of fuel according to the Royal Automobile Club, which said a cut in VAT from 20% to 15% would reduce the cost per litre by about 6p. Drivers and businesses have also been hit by a record daily increase in diesel prices. Figures from the data firm Experian Catalist show the average cost of a litre of the fuel at UK forecourts reached 165.2p on Tuesday, up nearly 3p on Monday’s 162.3p. The RAC said the jump was the largest on records dating back to the year 2000. Hauliers also said their profit margins were being wiped out because of rising diesel bills. The RAC fuel spokesperson, Simon Williams, said: “The cost of a filling a 55-litre family car with petrol is now £87 – £7 more than it was at the start of the year. “Diesel drivers are even worse off, with a tank now costing more than £90 for the first time ever – £8 more than in early January.” With the war in Ukraine and announcement of bans of Russian oil and gas in response, wholesale fuel prices have soared and the price of Brent crude exceeded $124 a barrel on Wednesday. Williams said this meant price increases at the pump in the coming days were inevitable. “Petrol is now certain to top an average of £1.60 a litre this week, while diesel will progress very quickly towards £1.70. We continue to call on the chancellor to help drivers by temporarily cutting VAT to at least 15%,” he said. “As it stands, 26p a litre of what drivers are paying on the forecourt is attributable to VAT and that comes on top of 58p a litre in fuel duty. This tax on a tax is causing unbelievable financial pain to drivers, which is why we believe Mr Sunak holds the key to easing the burden.”",News/World news,Irish cabinet to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/09/irish-cabinet-cut-excise-duty-petrol-diesel-ukraine-russia-uk
3/9/2022,"Although popular, the Spanish gameshow Atrapame Se Podes (Catch Me if You Can) has a thuddingly generic premise. You answer some questions and you win some money, and that’s about the extent of it. Until this week, host Paco Lodeiro asked two contestants what the going rate for a gram of cocaine was. After some hesitation, both contestants correctly guessed that it was €60. And now the state-run TVG channel that airs Atrapame Se Podes has been forced to apologise for trivialising drug addiction. According to the show, the answer was taken from a report published by the Spanish health ministry rather than first-hand knowledge, but you can understand the touchiness. The episode aired in Galicia, the north-western region of Spain that has become one of the major European gateways in the drug trade. Netflix’s Cocaine Coast is about Galicia. Amazon’s Operation Black Tide is a dramatisation of the 2019 capture of a submarine carrying three tonnes of cocaine off the region’s coast. The storm that the question created could have been easily avoided, but on the plus side it does at least allow Atrapame Se Podes passage into the controversial gameshow hall of fame. Almost since the dawn of television itself, gameshows have been blindly wandering into all sorts of trouble thanks to moments of insensitivity. Below are some of the most notorious incidents. This 2008 US gameshow staked its entire reputation on asking controversial questions. The (deeply icky) premise of the show was this: contestants were hooked up to a lie detector and asked the most excruciatingly personal questions imaginable. If they answered truthfully, they won a cash prize. In one episode, a woman admitted that she wished that she had married another man and that she had cheated on her husband. On another unaired episode, another contestant said that she thought her father had sex with minors. The Moment of Truth only lasted a single season, perhaps because it was the very worst television show ever made. In 1977, this American gameshow – in which new spouses are asked questions about how well they know each other – threw up a question that quickly turned into an urban legend. Host Bob Eubanks asked the assembled new wives where the weirdest place they ever wanted to “make whoopee” was. One woman, perhaps misunderstanding the question, answered: “In the ass?” As an aside, in 1979, there was a short-lived American gameshow called 3’s a Crowd, which riffed on the premise of The Newlywed Game by bringing on the male contestant’s secretary as well as his wife. The point of the show was to see whether a man had a closer relationship with his wife or his secretary. This was a real show that actually existed. Technically not a question, but still enough to force an apology from the show, was the incident last year where a Countdown contestant used a homophobic word as a slur. During a letters round, contestant Matt Gould breezily declared the seven-letter answer “poofter” to Anne Robinson, and the moment made it to air. Gould subsequently claimed that he thought the moment would have been edited out of the final episode, and Channel 4 rushed out a statement stating that the incident “does not align with our values”. Strange, given that this isn’t the first time this has happened, as you can see from the above video clip from 2009, showing exactly the same word being broadcast. My favourite incident, though, is also perhaps the stupidest. Those of you with long enough memories will remember Quizmania, ITV’s late-night call-in quiz show. In 2006, Quizmania posed the question: “What would you find in a woman’s handbag?” The assorted insomniac or drunk Quizmania viewers called in with their guesses, at a cost of 75p a minute, but sadly failed to get all the answers right. This, it turns out, is because Quizmania decided that one of the correct answers was “rawlplugs”. The incident was so stupid, in fact, that Ofcom found ITV Play to be in breach of its broadcasting code.",Arts/Television & radio,‘How much does a gram of cocaine cost?’ – the most tasteless moments in TV quiz history,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/09/how-much-does-a-gram-of-cocaine-cost-the-most-tasteless-moments-in-tv-quiz-history
3/9/2022,"Les Dennis, the comic and former Family Fortunes presenter, has done solid work in musical theatre and found a late-career phase on television in sending himself up as an ironised national treasure for Ricky Gervais and Reeves and Mortimer. But it’s difficult to find any postmodern justification for this dire indie Britfilm comedy which is directed and scripted like kids’ TV – albeit a very filthy sort of kids’ TV. Dennis plays Pendrick, who tours provincial theatres with a tragically naff mind-reading act, often in the company of his peppery agent Gerald (Anthony Head), who has to feed him his cues and get him out of trouble when his heavy drinking and foul-mouthed abuse of the paying customers and theatre management get out of hand. But does Pendrick have a secret? One person in the audience who thinks so is Eva (April Pearson). With a dopey incompetent accomplice called Dom (Nathan Clarke), she plans to break into his flat, with all its tatty posters and memorabilia, and get at something that might actually be worth more than money. Now, there is mileage in that initial setup and the movie certainly does end with an ingenious and unexpected bang after 95 minutes of whimperingly ropey dialogue and sub-Viz gross-out stuff, as well as offensive gags about a minority, which are supposed to be justified (but aren’t) by a final plot reveal. Again and again, the thought occurs: this material wouldn’t pass muster for any type of TV comedy, so why is it making it into a feature film? And with talented professionals who have done better things on the small screen? It’s a puzzle.

3/9/2022,"Irish dairy and beef farmers are being urged to start growing crops, as agriculture ministers from G7 countries including Britain’s George Eustice prepare to meet on Friday to discuss grain shortages and food price volatility amid the war in Ukraine. There are rising fears that consumers will face price hikes on staples such as bread in addition to rises in fuel, with grain supplies disrupted by the conflict. Ukraine, once known as the breadbasket of Europe, said on Wednesday it was banning exports of rye, barley, buckwheat, millet, sugar, salt and meat for the rest of the year. Together with Russia it supplies 30% of global wheat and barley, fuelling fears of shortages not seen since the second world war when consumers in Britain were encouraged to plant vegetables in gardens, yards and on rooftops. Government data shows Ukraine supplies 20% of the UK’s cereals. Vikki Campbell, a market specialist at the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (AHDB), said the price of wheat futures – grain to be bought on 22 May – had gone up on six consecutive days. On 18 February, days before war, wheat was trading in London at £220 a tonne, but had surged to £289.50 when the market closed on Tuesday. “We do know that supply chains are going to be facing extra costs. Fuel is going up for everyone and processing costs. If we look at a load of bread, wheat makes up 10% of the cost of a loaf you get in the supermarket with 90% coming from other parts of the supply chain, and we know other parts of the supply chain, such as fuel, have not been shielded,” she said. Ronald Kers, the chief executive of 2 Sisters Food Group, the UK’s biggest chicken producer, told the Times that the cost of growing a chicken had increased by 50% since last January and he expected food inflation to exceed predictions. Campbell said the market was already squeezed by shortages caused by drought in the US and Canada last year. The AHDB said the price of fertiliser had also shot up as it relied on natural gas. The Irish agriculture minister, Charlie McConalogue, asked farmers to grow more crops to offset food supply issues caused by the Russian invasion. Farmers are urging the government to issue €2,000 (£1,670) vouchers to help them fertilise the land for crops and winter fodder. Irish farming is dominated by beef and dairy producers, with 60% of grain imported. “Food security is really important over the next number of weeks and months and it is something we have to work together on,” he told RTÉ. Pressed on weekend reports that farmers would be instructed to grow grain – the first time this would have happened since the second world war – McConalogue said: “I think one of the most economical things that any farm can do is consider planting some grain this year and they should look at that and consider their options.”",News/Business,Irish dairy and beef farmers urged to grow crops amid Ukraine shortage fears,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/09/irish-dairy-beef-farmers-urged-grow-crops-grain-shortage-fears
3/9/2022,"Thirty years ago, when I walked into the Saatchi gallery in London, I saw something wildly liberating and compulsive: a huge tiger shark that seemed to swim forward through clear blue liquid, with just a sheet of glass between you and its jaws. But the shark you see on entering Damien Hirst’s survey of his formaldehyde creations is not the same work: it’s Jaws 2, or even Jaws 3, the one where the mother shark attacks an aquarium. It is called Death Denied and was made in 2008, a fresher version of the notoriously decaying original, titled The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living. But even 14 years is a long time for a dead shark, and this one’s getting very shrunken around the mouth. Any fear of those teeth – and the inevitable advance of death they symbolise – rapidly dissipates as you take in the progress of Hirst from raw young punk to pretentious money-lover. It is still possible to put on a strong exhibition of his early work, with its genuine sense of grabbing something from this short life, but what we see here instead is how his original desire to shock has become empty and artificial. Somewhere along the line he stopped feeling it. Behind the shark are three tall tanks with a dissected upright sheep in each, like the three crosses in a medieval altarpiece. Of course, he’s emulating Francis Bacon, who took the gothic art form of the triptych (or three-part altarpiece) and filled it with painted meat, purple and grey emanations of godless flesh. Does Hirst want to be Bacon? He isn’t. The Pursuit of Oblivion is a towering tank, inside which an umbrella floats over an empty overcoat on a chair, among sides of beef and butchery tools hanging in still, clear fluid. It is a homage to Bacon’s crushingly real nightmares, especially his 1946 canvas, Painting. The cleavers and knives remind you of Bacon’s admiration for butchers’ shops. As the eloquent Soho existentialist once said between drinks: “Ham, pigs, tongues, sides, of beef seen in the butcher’s window, all that death, I find it very beautiful.” Bacon waxed lyrical about meat but what he put on canvas was paint. His smears of pink and grey, his sickening orange backgrounds and tubular furniture, are acts of imagination. Hirst’s vitrine looks like the artistic effort of someone with no imagination. Why can’t you create a Bacon masterpiece with real meat and a real umbrella? Because it becomes banal. It’s like pretending that by exhibiting a pig sliced in two to reveal its guts you’ve made a powerful modern version of Leonardo da Vinci’s anatomical drawings. Oh and yes, Hirst does try that one here, too. The more art history his vitrines quote, the sillier they seem. Chopping off a cow’s head to create The Beheading of John the Baptist (2006) does seem a bloody waste. It just does not achieve the same pathos and horror as Caravaggio could get by painting a man with his head half removed in a prison yard and the executioner reaching with his knife to sever the last flap of skin. That’s because Caravaggio and Bacon were painting human suffering. Many will be offended by the fact that every work in this show is made with dead animals. But, paradoxically, you would have to believe every animal death equal to the death of a human to be moved in the right way by The Beheading of John the Baptist. As someone who still eats meat, it would be hypocritical for me to weep. So the only people who can take Hirst seriously are more likely to be outside the gallery protesting. To be fair, he’s closer to veganism than you might think. His early 1997 piece Shut Up and Eat Your Fucking Dinner is a grotesque recreation of a butcher’s window. It looks like a memory of being sickened by windows full of dead animals when he was a little boy in Leeds. But this ghost of sensitivity fades in the cold, industrial output of fake masterpieces that surround it. This is art for the penthouses of oligarchs who look out of their windows and ask who really cares about all those pieces of meat walking about down there.

3/9/2022,"Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of presiding over a “failed energy policy” which is seeing bills rocket, calling for the government to invest in nuclear and renewable energy sources and insulate homes to cut reliance on Russian oil and gas. The Labour leader used prime minister’s questions to repeatedly link the impact of the invasion of Ukraine to the cost of living, an issue where many Conservative MPs want to see more robust action from ministers. Starmer called for more direct help to cut energy bills, including a windfall tax on oil companies, but also demanded urgent action to reduce reliance on hydrocarbons, including an end to a de facto ban on new onshore wind projects. Johnson argued against a windfall tax, and insisted existing efforts to help with energy bills were generous. Starmer responded with derision, saying: “I don’t think the prime minister understands the mess he’s in.” The government, Starmer said, should be “starting a new era of energy policy, never again at the mercy of a dictator”, including more nuclear power, “sprinting” for more renewables, and rapid moves to insulate homes. “So why is the prime minister offering the same failed energy policy that cast us into the security crisis and allowed bills to rocket?” Starmer asked. Johnson argued the government had already introduced “unprecedented measures” to help with bills, including a one-off £200 loan to offset energy costs, and £150 for some households towards council tax. Johnson dismissed the idea of a windfall tax, saying: “The net result of that would be to see the oil companies put their prices up yet higher, and make it more difficult for them to do what we need them to do … and that is divesting from dependence on Russian oil and gas. That is the way forward for this country – it is to take a sober, responsible approach.” But Starmer noted that average energy bills were due to rise by £700 in April, with the £200 loan not arriving till October, by which point bills were likely to rise another £1,000. “It’s a total mess,” Starmer said. “So I ask again: when is the prime minister going to force the chancellor to U-turn?” After Johnson ruled out the idea of a windfall tax on the high profits from oil companies assisted by rising prices, Starmer said the prime minister was “protecting energy profits, not working people”. The Labour leader said: “Britain can’t afford another crisis like this. We need to improve our long-term energy security. That starts with supporting new nuclear and renewables.” The government had, he said, “effectively banned new onshore wind”, asking: “Will the prime minister relax planning laws, end the block on onshore wind, and stop supporting policies that make us so dependent on foreign gas?” Saying that the UK had the least energy-efficient housing stock in Europe, Starmer called for an “urgent national mission” to insulate homes, saying this could save households £400 a year in bills. “All the government has is a failed policy,” Starmer said. “Taking all their announcements together, it will take 75 years to deliver the upgrades that we need. That’s a lifetime, when we need urgent action. When is the prime minister going to get on with it?” Johnson argued that the UK was “the Saudi Arabia of wind power”, and blamed the lack of new nuclear power on Labour governments, which were last in power in 2010.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer says PM’s ‘failed energy policy’ is causing bills to rocket,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/09/keir-starmer-says-pms-failed-energy-policy-is-causing-bills-to-rocket
3/9/2022,"A cabinet minister has told British troops and ex-service personnel it is illegal to try to join the fight in Ukraine, after it emerged that a serving Coldstream Guard and the ex-marine son of a Tory MP are believed to be among those who have joined the war. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, told troops “you cannot just get up and go” and that Britons travelling to Ukraine to fight risked worsening a “dangerous situation”. His comments come after the Sun revealed that a 19-year-old Coldstream Guard was among up to four missing British soldiers believed to have travelled to fight Russia. The teenager, who is based in Windsor barracks, wrote a goodbye letter to his parents and bought a ticket to Poland over the weekend with the aim of crossing into Ukraine, the paper reported. The Guardian also revealed that the former Royal Marine commando Ben Grant, the son of the former government minister Helen Grant, travelled to fight in Ukraine over the weekend with six other ex-servicemen. Shapps stressed there was a “big difference” between individuals taking the potentially illegal decision and the UK dispatching its troops to fight alongside Ukrainians. Ministry of Defence chiefs have banned all service personnel from travelling to Ukraine “until further notice”, saying breaching the advice could lead to prosecution. Shapps told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “You cannot go and fight if you are in the British army, you cannot just get up and go and fight … That is inappropriate behaviour and you would expect the army to have some very, very strict rules in place, as they do.” Asked what Russia might do if a British soldier was captured or killed, Shapps said: “There’s a big difference between Britain sending its army in and some people who are breaking with our law and going to do it. “This is a dangerous situation. And clearly, we want to make sure that the assistance we are providing is done in an official way – like the anti-tank missiles that we provided prior to and during this conflict, and like the 22,000 Ukrainians that we’ve trained.” A Ministry of Defence spokesperson added: “All service personnel are prohibited from travelling to Ukraine until further notice. This applies whether the service person is on leave or not. Personnel travelling to Ukraine will face disciplinary and administrative consequences.” Three days after the invasion began, the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said she would “absolutely” support UK nationals who chose to join the war. But since then the government has contradicted her remarks. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, who served in the Scots Guards, has previously urged British civilians not to join the fighting. A Downing Street spokesperson said: “We think the best way we can help Ukraine right now is by ensuring Putin fails. We fully recognise the strength of feeling about British people wanting to support the Ukrainians following the Russian invasion.

In the past decade Brittney Griner ignited Baylor’s undefeated college national championship run, helped USA Basketball to a pair of Olympic gold medals, and lifted the WNBA’s Phoenix Mercury to a league title just one year after being drafted first overall. And now the Houston native’s glittering career could come to an end inside a Russian jail cell. On Saturday came word that the 31-year-old Griner had been detained at an airport near Moscow after customs agents said they caught her with a hoard of vape cartridges containing hashish oil. Even more distressing than this news breaking some three weeks after Griner had landed in Sheremetyevo from New York was the 10-year maximum prison sentence that Russia reserves for the crime she is alleged to have committed. On Sunday the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, offered oblique support for Griner, saying “we of course stand ready to provide every possible assistance.” The Texas Democratic congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee called for her immediate release. Meanwhile, a former top Pentagon official feared Griner could become a “high-profile hostage” and be used as a bargaining chip. Griner embodies much of what Vladimir Putin despises about the west. Set aside the fact that Griner was coming to Russia after representing the US in the Fiba World Cup qualifying, she’s a lesbian who isn’t just married to a woman, but for the second time. She is also gender non-conforming, Black and an activist who has lent her considerable stature to the various social justice protests her WNBA peers have championed. In the Sheremetyevo airport CCTV footage released by the Russian customs officials over the weekend Griner appears in a “Black Lives for Peace” jumper as dogs sniff her bags and agents unpack their contents. But if the idea of flying to Russia in wartime seems unwise – setting aside the alleged hash oil, the state department had been warning Americans to stay away since January – well, the depressing economic realities of women’s basketball didn’t really give Griner much choice. A seven-time all-star and two-time defensive player of the year, Griner is one of the WNBA’s “max players”, the designation for stars who earn the league’s maximum salary of $222,000. As reasonable as that might seem for a few months’ work, it’s tipping money compared with the NBA, where stars clear more than $40m a season and the minimum a rookie can take home is $925,258. For the better part of 25 years, the WNBA has operated as an NBA subsidiary on shoestring budgets. But as WNBA teams have changed hands, new-school owners have strained the league’s minimalist business model. Keeping stars of Griner’s magnitude confined to the strictures of the WNBA’s limited budgets is a bit like forcing a 6ft 9in body into an economy seat on a commercial flight – which is exactly what the WNBA insists its players do. The league fined the New York Liberty $500,000 last fall for secretly chartering flights to travel to some games during the 2021 season, a luxury the league’s collective bargaining agreement deems a competitive advantage, Howard Megdal revealed in SI.com last week. And while the league and the owners disagree over what exactly led to their star players travelling in less style and comfort than they did as college players, what’s not in dispute is WNBA salaries not being near high enough to dissuade players from taking second jobs in Turkey, South Korea and farther-flung locales during the fall and winter. Last year alone, more than 60% of the WNBA’s rostered players competed overseas during the offseason, many trading the comforts of home and downtime with family for big money. And no country has proven more willing to splurge on a splashy American hoops rental than Mother Russia, where oligarch-backed teams can pay whatever their patrons are willing to spend. In 2008, after being passed over yet again for USA Basketball’s Beijing Olympics team, San Antonio Stars all-star Becky Hammon signed a four-year, $2m contract with CSKA Moscow that included a six-figure bonus for becoming a naturalised citizen and medaling at the Games. Hammon, who was branded a traitor while leading Russia to bronze, would’ve been making around $95,000 in the WNBA at the time. In January, she returned to the WNBA as a coach of the Las Vegas Aces – for a league-high $1m salary that reopened old wounds about the low pay for players. In 2015 UMMC Ekaterinburg, a mining firm-sponsored pro team backed by the billionaire Iskander Makhmudov, paid the Phoenix Mercury’s Diana Taurasi $1.5m – 15 times her WNBA salary – to sit out the WNBA season. Griner supported the decision. “This is a chance for her to set herself up financially, and her family,” she told the Arizona Republic. She and Taurasi haven’t just been teammates for all of nine years of Griner’s WNBA career. After her rookie season she followed Taurasi on to UMMC Ekaterinburg and, together, lifted them to three national championships and four EuroLeague crowns. It was that commitment, which reportedly pays Griner $1.5m a season, that put her on that flight to Sheremetyevo. Now she sits in detention, awaiting her fate. And it’s as yet unclear how much Makhmudov, who is on the state department’s sanctions list, can help. Suffice to say, if Griner were born a man, she wouldn’t have these problems. She’d be home.",Sport/Sport,Brittney Griner’s Russian ordeal is a byproduct of WNBA’s shoestring funding | Andrew Lawrence,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/09/brittney-griners-russian-ordeal-is-a-byproduct-of-wnbas-shoestring-funding
3/9/2022,"More than 1,000 veiled women attended marches to promote Islamic values in cities across Pakistan on International Women’s Day in an attempt to counter pro-gender equality rallies. In Islamabad and Karachi, well-attended “hijab marches”, organised by religious groups, competed with those participating in aurat – Urdu for women – rallies, which call for an end to systemic discrimination in the country. The aurat march has been held each year on 8 March – International Women’s Day – since 2018, and organisers have faced numerous death threats as well as accusations of taking foreign funding to promote obscenity. Last month Pakistan’s minister for religious affairs, Noor-ul-Haq Qadri, opposed the aurat march, and said it violated Islamic values. He demanded that the prime minister, Imran Khan, rename 8 March as Hijab Day, which prompted Tuesday’s counter-marches. “Every year on our day religious Islamist parties threaten our march and oppose it, but Pakistani women will continue our struggle and we will counter this opposition for our rights,” said Farzana Bari, one of the aurat organisers. Hira Ali, a university student from Islamabad, where men hurled stones at marchers in 2020, said: “The Islamists came out to suppress our voice and we will not allow them to oppose our right to protest and we own our public space. “The perpetrators of violence against women often walk away without facing punishments and we will fight against the injustices,” she said. In the past there has been controversy among conservative and religious circles over the slogans and placards used in the march, primarily: “My body, my choice” and “Stop being menstrual-phobic”. Authorities in Lahore urged organisers to cancel the event there on security grounds, and threatened not to provide security for the marchers, but after a legal challenge in the city’s high court the march went ahead. Fabricated videos and fake images of last year’s International Women’s Day march were circulated online and appeared on TV shows falsely accusing women of chanting blasphemous slogans, which carries the death penalty in Pakistan. Over the past four years the aurat march organisers have claimed victories for gender equality, for example last year’s ban on the “virginity test” for female rape victims in Punjab. But the flood of threats and online abuse have led march organisers to deactivate their social media accounts. Last year’s Global Gender Gap Report by the World Economic Forum ranked Pakistan 153 out of 156 countries.",News/Global development,‘Hijab marches’ compete with Pakistan’s International Women’s Day rallies,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/09/hijab-marches-compete-with-pakistans-international-womens-day-rallies
3/9/2022,"As someone who spends lots of time on social media, I’d heard of the musical Dear Evan Hansen long before it came to London. It tells the story of Evan Hansen, a 17-year-old struggling with social anxiety, whose world is upended when the grieving parents of a fellow high school student who has recently taken his own life come to believe he was their son’s only friend. Between Broadway and the West End, the show has won numerous awards – among them Tonys for best musical, best book of a musical, best original score; a Grammy for best musical theatre album; and an Olivier for best new musical. Settling down in my seat at the Noël Coward Theatre, in the West End, I’m excited to finally get to understand why it has earned so many accolades, as well as a dedicated fan base. ‘It’s addictive’The buzz in the air is different from any show I’ve seen in a while. People are posing for photos in front of the stage and avidly reading the programme from cover to cover. There are groups of teenagers, hordes of twenty and thirtysomethings, parents with children, and solo spectators. Many are humming the show’s songs as they wait for the stage to spring to life, making it clear they’ve been a few times before – or at least streamed the soundtrack to death. “This isn’t a show you see just once,” says Ella, 19. “It’s addictive.” Ella has been before with her family and again with her boyfriend. Today she is with her friend, Laura, 18. It’s her first time, but she already loves all the songs and is excited to finally see them performed live. ‘There is a character and a topic for everyone’Jack, 30, is another returning audience member, seeing the show for the second time – on this occasion with his boyfriend Adam, 23, and friend, Chloe, 23, as well as his dad and stepmum. “There is a character and a topic for everyone,” he says. “It’s strange that a show about a teenage boy can speak to so many different people.” Adam agrees: “Not everyone has been through the same thing, but everyone can pick out something whether it’s the family dynamics or the feeling of being alone.” As the audience piles in, notifications ping non-stop from an array of digital screens on the stage, which display a stream of social media posts. Although they flash by too quickly to read, I make out posts from celebrities ranging from Kim Kardashian to Neil deGrasse Tyson. The show makes great use of these screens throughout, particularly in act one’s closing number, You Will Be Found. The high-tech set design is a hit with the audience, and establishes Dear Evan Hansen as a thoroughly modern musical. Amy, 16, who came with friends to watch the show for the second time, explains its relatability: “Our lives are dominated by social media,” she says. “The use of the screens on stage throughout the show really showed how social media is a constant presence in our lives.” Dear Evan Hansen has a lot to say about the pitfalls of social media, but Charlotte, 17, who was with Amy, thinks it also highlights its value. “The show does a really good job of showing the best and worst of it,” she says. “Through using social media, Evan creates a space for people to share, to help them if they are feeling alone. That’s how social media has helped me and it’s so amazing to see that on stage.” That balance of positive and negative, light and dark, is explored all the way through the production. The show isn’t afraid to cover serious topics, such as mental health, death and marital breakdown, but offers light relief with a throughline of humour and a message of hope, something Jack appreciates. “Comedic breaks are definitely needed,” he says. “To be able to balance them with such a raw story is an incredible achievement.” ‘As a mum, I feel the pain of the parents’Sue, 56, is seeing the show with her daughter, Cara. She wasn’t really sure what to expect, assuming it was just “about the internet” when she agreed to go. Speaking after the show, her preconceptions have been disproved. “You think one character is one thing, but then they show another side to them. All of the characters are so complicated,” she says. “As a mum watching, I can feel the pain of the parents, but you can really see how all the characters come together to support each other.” Mum and daughter both agree that it is not a traditional musical. “It’s unique,” says Cara. It’s clear from everyone I speak to that the songs and the acting stand out. Third time viewer Grace, 26, who is watching with her brother Lou, 29, finds Sam Tutty “mesmerising” as Evan, but is just as impressed with the rest of the cast. “The ensemble singing hits you hard,” says Lou. “It’s amazing how all the voices work so well together to tell the story.” The pair struggle to pick just one favourite song, going back and forth between Disappear and Words Fail. Both songs seem to get the biggest applause, yet every number is well received. Dear Evan Hansen is a show that refuses to be pigeonholed, but if there’s one lesson to be learned, Laura believes it is that “you are not alone, no matter how alone you feel, or how different you are” – an inarguably uplifting message.

3/9/2022,"Sam Tutty is a rising star in British theatre – which is very lucky for British theatre, because until quite recently the 22-year-old thought he might become an athlete. “But by the time I finished my A-levels it had just got too hard. I’d sprint for 20 minutes then throw up,” he says over a Zoom chat. Fortunately, this self-deprecating young man discovered other talents at his West Sussex comprehensive. “I did a drama GCSE – and I was like: ‘This is really fun.’ I was getting good grades and it was really enjoyable and I wasn’t having to try too hard,” he says. He may joke about shying away from hard work, but it’s clearly not true. Deciding that he wanted to pursue acting, he enrolled on a year-long foundation course at the renowned Italia Conti academy, winning a scholarship. Thankfully, there was no vomiting. “The teachers there were phenomenal,” he says. “It was a dance-heavy school and I was really thrown in at the deep end, but the teachers always said that if they could see you were trying then they’d rate you. And I really respect that. Now, I can move: give me a routine, give me a month and I can do something with it.” It was at Conti that he heard about a casting call for an intriguing American musical called Dear Evan Hansen. “I remember listening to it and I was like: ‘Oh my gosh it’s so different!’” says Tutty. “You can’t really see any elements of traditional musical theatre in it.” The show follows Evan Hansen, an American high school student who, in a misguided attempt to console the grieving family of Connor Murphy, a troubled classmate who has recently taken his own life, fabricates a thread of emails between the two of them to show that he had at least one true friend. It’s a unique musical with a taxing and delicate central role: Hansen hardly leaves the stage, and any actor playing him needs to sing like an angel and deliver nuanced acting, lest Hansen comes across as calculating, rather than a panicked young person out of his depth. Does he relate to Hansen, whose head he’s been inside for so long? Personality-wise, says Tutty, they’re polar opposites and he’s never been faced with a similar situation – but being able to relate to Evan in spite of this is vital. “He can’t look like he’s enjoying it in any way,” Tutty says. “You can’t make it too funny, because then people will say: ‘Look at this sociopath only pretending to be nervous, why would I root for him?’ He’s only doing what he thinks is right – it’s so important I make the audience understand.” Landing the part was a long process, which he survived, he says, thanks to a combination of naivety and his mum’s advice. “If it were me now I think I’d have probably had a nervous breakdown,” he laughs. “I was so ignorant of the scale. But my mum was a real help. Every time I got another recall she said: ‘Just relax – it’s not a big thing, just look at it as character building.’” Tutty attended an open audition, had a great time, and didn’t hear back. A few months later, his agent got him a fresh audition, and that set him on the path that would bag him the role, but not before he’d had more than a dozen callbacks, several in New York. It went on for so long that he ended up taking a role in the musical Once on This Island in the summer of 2019. He looks back on the time fondly, but with a certain amount of amusement and bemusement. “One day, after my second New York trip, I landed at Heathrow at 9am and then got the tube to Covent Garden where we were rehearsing [Once on This Island] and did a 10-til-six. I was on my knees!” Midway through, he learned he’d got the Dear Evan Hansen gig, and rehearsals started shortly thereafter. When the show opened at the Noël Coward Theatre in the West End of London, in November 2019, both it and Tutty won rave reviews. His is a staggering performance: a masterclass in sensitive teenhood spiralling out of control, plus skyscraping songs – check out You Will Be Found. An Olivier award nomination duly followed. The show looked to be unstoppable. But then everything stopped. The pandemic meant Dear Evan Hansen had to close for 17 months. Some consolation: the postponed Oliviers were held in a semi-digital ceremony that autumn, and Tutty won best leading actor in a musical, with the show itself winning best new musical the same year – adding to an impressive collection of accolades that includes Tonys for best musical, best book of a musical, best original score; and a Grammy for best musical theatre album. The award was a shock to the system, he says, admitting that he struggles to feel he’s earned it (for the record, he has). Dear Evan Hansen is now back on stage and currently booking, providing a very rare opportunity indeed to see an Olivier-winning production nearly three years on – what’s more, the cast reckon they’re better than ever thanks to re-rehearsing the show post-lockdown. “All my friends or family who came to see it again were like: ‘Don’t take this the wrong way, you were all amazing pre-Covid, but this is a different show’ – and we agreed with them!” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

3/9/2022,"Most West End musicals aim to disconnect audiences from their phones, encouraging them to turn off those annoying notifications for just a few hours. But at London’s Noël Coward Theatre, where the award winning Dear Evan Hansen is showing, audiences are instead greeted by a giant newsfeed displaying tweets from DJ Khaled, among others – bringing them firmly into the lonely, online world of its title character. The musical tells the story of Evan Hansen, a 17-year-old American high school student struggling with anxiety who, in a misguided attempt to console the grieving family of Connor Murphy, a troubled classmate who has recently taken his own life, fabricates a thread of emails between the two of them to show that he had at least one true friend. In doing so he wins the craved for attention and admiration of his fellow pupils, but is faced with a devil’s bargain when it comes to revealing the true nature of his relationship to Murphy. This high-stakes premise is lent contrast by the beautiful, stripped-back score that has received numerous accolades, including the Tony award for best original score and Grammy award for best musical theater album. Composed by the songwriting duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul – who were behind all the score and songs for The Greatest Showman, as well as the lyrics for La La Land – the music is brought to life on stage by an eight-piece band, to communicate emotions, amplify character and add texture to the narrative. “One of the great things about the show musically is that it is so acoustic,” says musical director Matt Smith. “It feels live and in the room – the acoustic guitar is the lead instrument in the whole thing.” The soaring ballad Waving Through a Window raises the roof early on, channelling the vulnerability of the socially anxious Evan to show us the inner turmoil beneath his awkward exterior: someone always at a distance yet desperate to make a bigger impact. “One of the things that Justin, Benj and [the orchestrator] Alex Lacamoire talk about, is this recurring pulse,” says Smith, demonstrating the evocative piano motif over Zoom. “Every time that pulse comes, it’s a representation of the anxiety that Evan is feeling. So Waving Through a Window starts immediately with that pulse and builds as he tells a story. By the end of that song we know everything there is to know about this character.” Many of the tunes are reminiscent of the emo-folk of Bright Eyes or Elliot Smith, from the optimistic and naive For Forever to the gut wrenching Requiem, which sees a grieving family wrestle with their conflicting feelings of anger and loss over a simple arrangement designed to make the vocals feel raw and exposed. “I think it’s very clever because with the lyrics, you could do any of the songs as a monologue,” says Lucy Anderson, who was nominated for an Olivier in 2020 for best supporting actress in a musical for her portrayal of Zoe Murphy – Connor’s sister and Hansen’s love interest – a role that marked her West End debut. “To me, I’ve always just seen it as text, with the music then supporting the emotion of it. “As an actor I feel I almost don’t have to try too hard to get across how she’s feeling. It’s all there in the writing and all you have to do is bring it to life,” she says. This blend of music and lyrics is further cemented through the conversational style of songs such as To Break in a Glove and Only Us, which, as Anderson notes, almost move from dialogue into song without the audience realising. “There’s something so beautiful about the way you can go from just having a conversation and then it’s gently aided by this underscore,” she says. “It’s another big part of why I think this show works so well, because every single song has been planted in the perfect spot.” The first act’s closing song, You Will Be Found, has proved to be the show’s breakout hit, wowing audiences thanks to its stirring chorus and themes of togetherness, reminding people that they are not alone – a simple notion that has perhaps felt especially poignant over the past two years. “It’s the message of the song that people can really relate to,” says Smith. “While it’s very specific in the story, it’s also a song that works on its own as well. A listener can immediately understand what it’s about and identify with the message.” The immediate and enthusiastic standing ovation at the climax of each performance certainly leaves no doubt as to how far that message has spread, with the music of Dear Evan Hansen connecting with the audience on a level far beyond the expectations of the cast and crew. “We get a lot of people that thank us for telling the story,” says Anderson. “Which as an actor is such a wonderful thing to hear because you know that what you are doing is changing someone’s day and making it a bit better and more hopeful.” And, as Smith notes: “I haven’t been involved with a show where so many of the crowd stay around and applaud the exit music. There’s obviously an appreciation and a recognition – you always have to take a – slightly awkward – second bow after the music.” In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.
