1/18/2022,"Hello and welcome to Five Great Reads, your mid-morning wrap of slow news and great writing, lovingly placed in a ziplock bag by me, Alyx Gorman, Guardian Australia’s lifestyle editor (more on the ziplock later).  If you’d like your news a little harder and faster, please head over to our live blog. If you’d rather be reading about the tennis, we’ve got that covered too. And if you just want to look at one thing that’s hectic and compelling, I have two options for you: a serial killer cold case from New York that may be getting warmer; and a piece on how Megan Fox and Machine Gun Kelly have double-handedly revived the weird rock’n’roll celebrity relationship (“You smell like weed”/“I am weed”). Now we’re done with that meme, on to the reads. From 30km-high smoke plumes to tsunami warnings across the Pacific rim, this multimedia explainer shows what happened, where and when during the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai eruption. Show me on a map: Bonus read: Initial reports suggest there have been no mass casualties from the eruption but significant damage. Tonga’s deputy head of mission in Australia, Curtis Tuihalangingie, is urging patience when it comes to offering aid. Concerned with private fundraising efforts, he has asked the public to wait until a disaster relief fund is announced. “When people see such a huge explosion they want to help.” In her profile of Christine Baranski, Hadley Freeman describes the Good Fight star as an “Oh, her …” kind of actor. “Casual observers might not recognise her name, but they always, instantly, know her face.” Now, as she takes on “the Maggie Smith role” in what is being pitched as an American Downton Abbey, we’re likely to hear a fair few more “Oh hers”. Notable quote: “I can look back and think: ‘how often did I not get a role because I wasn’t pretty enough?’” Baranski says. “But look at the position I’m in now – two great roles, [my characters are] both No 1 on the call sheet. I’m like: ‘Damn! Late 60s and here I am.’ There is progress!” How long will it take me to read? About four minutes. Usually we talk about impostor syndrome in a workplace context; it’s that feeling that everyone else knows something you don’t. But what happens when that sense of playacting creeps its way into your home? Notable quote: “I remember walking into the playground and thinking, ‘everyone knows you’re not a real mum,’” says Ranee of the period shortly after she adopted her two children. “It was as if I had … ‘fake’ written on my forehead.” Feelgood solution: “We think we have to live to other people’s rules but then we feel inadequate when we don’t meet the mark,” says Blair, a single mother of three. “All the parenting books are templates. You have to invent your own way of parenting, because every child is unique.” John Berger’s Ways of Seeing “has inspired generations of writers, artists and curators, spawning academic conferences and tribute programmes,” writes Olivia Laing. Oh, and Emily Ratajkowski is a fan too. Flashback moment: “Broadcast in the pre-VCR, pre-digital age, the program itself was swiftly inaccessible,” Laing writes. “It was repeated once in 1973, after winning a Bafta, but was not screened again until 30 July 1994. Unless you had resorted to that new technology the video recorder, as some prescient teachers did, it was the companion book that gave Ways of Seeing its longevity.” How long will it take me to read? About four minutes. If you’ve found yourself wearing your face mask as an elbow guard when it’s not on your face (guilty), this guide to caring for Covid masks is a handy refresher.

No. Instead, make like Angela Merkel and bag it up.",News/Australia news,"Five Great Reads: an American Downton, parental impostor syndrome and a 70s must-watch",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/18/five-great-reads-an-american-downton-parental-impostor-syndrome-and-a-70s-must-watch
1/18/2022,"A woman who was dismissed after she flagged that she was “too short” to drive safely due to a bus redesign has been reinstated, the bus operator has said. Tracey Scholes, one of Greater Manchester’s first female bus drivers, who is 5ft (1.52m) tall, said Go North West’s changes meant she could no longer reach the pedals on the new model of bus used on her route without a blind spot appearing when she leaned backwards to use the wing mirrors.  After raising concerns with her employer, she was initially suspended and later dismissed with 12 weeks’ notice. The 57-year-old, who has been a bus driver for 34 years, made a final appeal for her job on 11 January. The bus firm said it was glad that Scholes had accepted a deal to drive other buses, and described her as a “valued and long-serving driver”, stressing that Scholes would now keep her job “after she decided to accept an offer to drive different buses as per a proposal made in September”. Scholes had said before her appeal that thanks to support from her union, Unite, the company had offered her different routes with buses that she is able to drive, but with fewer hours and less pay than in her previous contract. More than 25,000 people signed a petition calling for Scholes to be reinstated and a crowd of supporters gathered outside the Queens Road bus depot in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, where the appeal hearing took place. Scholes had previously spoken of the emotional strain she suffered during the ordeal, and revealed that she had “put everything on hold financially” as she felt unable to plan for the future. The widow and mother of three told BBC North West Tonight before the hearing: “I’ve never had a problem driving the vehicles in 34 years, but they’ve moved one of the mirrors on certain vehicles [ …] and it’s caused a blind spot for me.” Scott Maynard, the firm’s group HR director, said in a statement that Scholes’ weekly hours and rate of pay would be the same on her new route, and that she would start earlier so she could pick out a bus with wing mirrors of her preference. “We have said from the start that we wanted to keep Tracey and we are glad that she has changed her mind and decided to stay,” he said. He added that the company “operates no height restrictions on recruitment, and has multiple drivers of the same height, or below, as Tracey”. “It is categorically untrue that we would, or could, have threatened anybody with dismissal on grounds of height.” A Go North West spokesperson had previously said Scholes was a valued member of the team and that the company had made “numerous proposals to accommodate” Scholes, but that the suggestions were rejected, adding that the company was “sorry that we were left with no choice but to bring this driver’s employment to an end,” a decision that, Scholes said, “broke my heart”.",News/UK news,Manchester bus driver dismissed for being ‘too short’ given job back after appeal,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/17/manchester-bus-driver-dismissed-for-being-too-short-given-job-back-after-appeal
1/18/2022,"The rabbi and congregants of the Beth Israel synagogue in Colleyville, Texas have begun offering accounts of their 11-hour, partially live-streamed ordeal at the hands of British hostage-taker Malik Faisal Akram. Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker told CBS he initially welcomed the stranger, who had been staying in a Dallas homeless shelter, and made him a cup of tea. He said the man was not threatening or suspicious at first.  “Some of his story didn’t quite add up, so I was a little bit curious, but that’s not necessarily an uncommon thing,” the rabbi said. Cytron-Walker said he invited Akram to join the morning service. As he turned his back to face the direction of Jerusalem, he heard the click of a gun. During a period of silent prayer that followed, the Rabbi told the New York Times, he approached Akram and told him he was welcome to stay for the full service. Akram then revealed a gun and pointed it at the rabbi, setting off a drama that he told the outlet was tense and terrifying. “It was a lot of conversation, trying to keep things calm, trying to help him to see us as human beings, and listening to him rant,” he said. “Everybody, for the most part, was able to stay calm.” Akram took four people hostage, including the rabbi, with some of his comments being live-streamed to remote worshippers. “I’m gunned up. I’m ammo-ed up,” Akram told someone that he called nephew. “Guess what, I will die.” He was also heard to say, “I’m not a criminal.” The FBI said in a statement that Akram “spoke repeatedly about a convicted terrorist who is serving an 86-year prison sentence in the United States” – an apparent reference to Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani neuroscientist serving an 86-year sentence after being found guilty of attempted murder in an assault on US soldiers in Afghanistan. Akram ultimately did not harm the hostages, the rabbi told CBS, but they had been threatened throughout their ordeal. But the situation grew more tense as the hours passed. Jeffrey R Cohen, another man held hostage, described the ordeal on Facebook. “First of all, we escaped. We weren’t released or freed,” Cohen said. Cohen described how they’d talked to the gunman during their captivity. He later told the Times that the four hostages were kept together and were able to build enough good rapport with Akram that one was released. Yet, as the situation dragged on, Cohen said the gunman eventually told the remaining three to get on their knees. But as the gunman moved to sit back down, the rabbi told them to run according to an escape plan they’d developed. “In the last hour of our hostage crisis, the gunman became increasingly belligerent and threatening,” Cytron-Walker said Sunday in a statement. “There was a lot more yelling, a lot more threatening,” he told the Times. The rabbi said he devised a plan to make a break for it. They edged toward an exit When pizza was delivered, he suggested another hostage fetch it. Eventually, all were within 20 feet of the exit. “We were terrified,” Cytron-Walker told CBS. “And when I saw an opportunity where he wasn’t in a good position, I made sure that the two gentlemen who were still with me, that they were ready to go.” “The exit wasn’t too far away. I told them to go. I threw a chair at the gunman, and I headed for the door,” he said. “And all three of us were able to get out without even a shot being fired.” After the hostages exited the building, Akram briefly followed before returning inside the building. Law enforcement then moved to another part of the building before setting off an explosive device to gain entry. Akram died amid gunfire. Cytron-Walker credited security training with the hostages successful escape. “It’s a horrible thing that this kind of instruction is needed in our society today,” he said to the paper. “But we don’t get to always deal with the reality we want. We have to deal with reality as it exists.”",News/US news,‘We were terrified’: Texas rabbi and congregants detail hostage drama,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/17/texas-hostage-crisis-rabbi-details
1/18/2022,"A distress signal has been detected in an isolated, low-lying group of Tongan islands after Saturday’s huge volcanic eruption, even as most external communications remain down, and diaspora families anxiously await news. Reuters reports that the UN detected the distress signal on Monday, prompting particular concern for the inhabitants of Fonoi and Mango. According to the Tonga government, 36 people live on Mango and 69 on Fonoi.  The news comes as most communication between Tonga and the outside world is still cut off, after the Pacific nation’s main communication cable was broken by the eruption of Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano and subsequent tsunami. Tongans around the world may be forced to wait weeks for regular contact to resume, after testing confirmed that the cable connecting the islands to the outside world was cut in at least one place. A spokesperson for Southern Cross Cable, which operates other undersea cable networks across the region, said that testing by Fintel and Tonga Cable on Sunday afternoon “seems to confirm a likely cable break around 37km offshore from Tonga”. The offshore nature of the break means it is more difficult and time consuming to repair, with a specialist cable repair ship being dispatched from Papua New Guinea. The spokesperson said reports indicated that “while timing is currently unconfirmed it is likely to be one to two weeks before they have repaired the cable, conditions willing”. There have been no official confirmations of casualties from Tongan authorities, but the family of Angela Glover, a British woman living in Tonga who went missing in the tsunami, reported on Monday that her body had been found. Images from Australian and New Zealand defence force surveillance flights that travelled to the islands on Monday have not been released. But UN analysis of satellite imagery from the island of Nomuku found that almost all visible structures were covered with ash, and about 40% of visible structures were damaged. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that boulders and boats had washed ashore on Tongatapu, Tonga’s largest island, about 65km south of the volcano. “Seeing some of those waves come in and peeling back fencelines and structures, you can see the force of those surges,” she said. “Everyone just wants to establish how wide scale that impact has been … we want to be in Tonga and on the ground as soon as we are possibly able to be.” The United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a briefing on Monday there was significant infrastructural damage around the main island of Tongatapu. “We are particularly concerned about two small low-lying islands – Mango and Fonoi – following New Zealand and Australian surveillance flights confirming substantial property damage,” they said.",News/World news,"Distress signal detected in low-lying Tongan islands after volcano eruption, as first death reported",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/18/distress-signal-detected-in-low-lying-tongan-islands-after-volcano-eruption-as-first-death-reported
1/18/2022,"It takes a brave person to drop Mason Mount. Frank Lampard once said that Mount’s eyes would burn whenever he left him out and Thomas Tuchel saw something similar when he named the Chelsea midfielder on the bench against Manchester City on Saturday. “It’s within Mason’s character of being polite and respectful, so there is no harm,” Tuchel said. “But I get the eyes. I get the look. I know the look.” It is nothing new as far as Chelsea’s manager is concerned. After all Mount made no attempt to hide his displeasure after starting on the bench when Tuchel’s tenure at Stamford Bridge began with a goalless draw against Wolves a year ago. The England international was not afraid to take it up with Tuchel, who was pleased to see such a spirited response from a player who would go on to play a pivotal role in Chelsea winning the Champions League.  For Tuchel, that hunger is something to appreciate. He loves Mount’s personality and has made him a key part of his side. There is trust between the pair. Tuchel knows that Mount will carry out tactical instructions and, while the 23-year-old still has plenty of room for improvement, few of his teammates in Chelsea’s attack can match his level. Even so, this has not been the easiest of campaigns for Mount. He has scored seven goals in all competitions, but he has looked jaded at times. The exertions of helping England reach the Euro 2020 final have taken a toll and sometimes it is hard not to feel that Mount, who has played 34 times for club and country this season, needs a rest. It certainly seemed that way when Chelsea reached the Carabao Cup final by beating Tottenham last Wednesday. Tuchel was not happy with Mount’s performance – he was on his case from start to finish – and he decided to go in a different direction against City, with Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic asked to support Romelu Lukaku. “We were opting for runners,” Tuchel said. “We thought we could break the line more with Hakim as a left foot on the left side and going for Christian on the right side because of the arrival of Christian in the box. He is a bit more of a runner than Mason.” The plan malfunctioned. Ziyech, Pulisic and Lukaku rarely combined and Chelsea’s title hopes were all but over when Kevin De Bruyne gave City the lead. Would Mount, who sparkled when Chelsea beat City in the Champions League final, have made a difference? Maybe not. He has gone eight games without a goal and has been average since Christmas. Mount should start when Chelsea visit Brighton on Tuesday, but he has not been the same since Ben Chilwell suffered a season-ending knee injury. The left wing-back had a great understanding with Mount, who is at his best when he is part of a smooth collective. “I think he’s also missing Reece James,” Tuchel said. “Reece, N’Golo Kanté and him were so strong together. When you turn, you know without even looking he will come now, or I will go and get the pass and he will come, so I will be here.” Chelsea are striving for those connections. Mount, whose game is not about individual moments, needs them. Above all, though, he needs to be back on the pitch. “I felt Mason not like in the 100% zone, where he is untouchable, which he normally almost is,” Tuchel said. “He’s not happy about it, but it will not last long because everyone loves Mason – me included.”",Sport/Football,Tuchel hopes Manchester City omission helps Mount regain top form ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/17/tuchel-hopes-manchester-city-omission-helps-mount-regain-top-form
