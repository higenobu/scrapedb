5/13/2022,"Elon Musk may want Donald Trump back on Twitter, but not particularly in the White House. “Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter,” tweeted the Tesla CEO, who is currently working to buy the social media platform in a $44 billion deal. Even though I think a less divisive candidate would be better in 2024, I still think Trump should be restored to Twitter — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2022 Musk later suggested on Thursday that President Joe Biden was elected because people wanted a break from the non-stop controversies of the Trump administration. “Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country,” he wrote, adding “But actually everyone just wanted less drama.” Biden’s mistake is that he thinks he was elected to transform the country, but actually everyone just wanted less drama — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 12, 2022 Musk, a self-described champion of “free speech,” has said he’ll take Twitter private on completion of his purchase. Twitter banned Trump in January 2021 following his incitement of the deadly U.S. Capitol riot. He frequently used the platform to peddle conspiracy theories, attack enemies and divide the nation. Last week, Musk claimed Trump’s removal from Twitter had been a mistake. “I think it was a morally bad decision to be clear and foolish in the extreme,” he said, adding it “alienated a large part of the country and did not ultimately result in Donald Trump not having a voice.” Trump, though, has said he won’t return to Twitter and instead will focus on using his own Truth Social network. He is yet to officially declare his candidacy for 2024, despite teasing the prospect ever since losing the 2020 vote. This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated. GOP Rep.

5/13/2022,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) -Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said recent sharp yen moves were undesirable, echoing comments by the finance minister in a sign policymakers were focusing on the speed of moves in gauging the impact of the currency's slump on the economy. Kuroda said the yen's drop would affect households and firms in different ways, refraining from repeating his past comments a weak yen was generally good for Japan's economy. ""It's important for currency rates to move stably reflecting economic and financial fundamentals,"" Kuroda told parliament on Friday. ""The recent sharp, short-term fluctuations in the yen are undesirable, as it heightens uncertainty and makes it harder for companies to set business plans,"" he said on Friday. The remarks were line with those made by Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki, who said recent sharp yen moves were undesirable and that exchange-rate stability was important. ""A weak yen gives exports a boost but leads to higher import prices,"" he told the same parliament session. The yen's slump to two-decade lows against the dollar has emerged as a source of concern for Japanese policymakers, as it inflates already rising costs of fuel and raw material imports. Kuroda had repeatedly said a weak yen is good for the economy as a whole, as it boosts the value of profits Japanese firms earn overseas. The view contrasted with Suzuki's remarks that recent yen falls were bad for the economy. In Friday's parliament session, Kuroda reiterated the BOJ's resolve to keep monetary policy ultra-loose to support an economy that has yet to emerge from the pain inflicted by the COVID-19 pandemic. ""The economy is in the midst of a recovery and now faces headwinds from rising commodity prices,"" Kuroda said. ""It's therefore important to underpin economic activity with powerful monetary easing.""

5/13/2022,"Anthony Harvey/Getty Images Zara Phythian at the 'Doctor Strange' premiere in 2016. Doctor Strange actress Zara Phythian and her husband, Victor Marke, have been convicted of multiple charges of child sex abuse in a British court. According to a document provided to EW by the Nottingham Crown Court clerk, 37-year-old Phythian — who was tried under the name Zara Marke — was convicted of 14 counts, with her 59-year-old husband convicted of 18. The counts for Phythian all relate to sexual activity with a child that occurred between December 2005 and December 2008. She is named alongside Marke in all of her charges, though he is individually included on four additional indecent assault charges (for actions dating back to September 2002) as an individual. Marke's offenses include indecent assault of a 15-year-old victim, while both were convicted of multiple counts of sexual activity with another underage victim beginning when she was 13. Their actions span multiple years and repeated occasions involving the same victim. Some abuse survivors believe the safety measures mandated by the settlement don't go far enough Phythian has two dozen credits listed on IMDb, the most notable being a small role in the 2016 Doctor Strange blockbuster opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as a ""Brunette Zealot."" She does not appear in the sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Per BBC reporting, Marke claimed that the sexual activity occurred on only one occasion, and that Phythian was not involved alongside him. Phythian reportedly denied any sexual activity with one of the victims. Judge Mark Watson remanded the couple into custody following the trial, ahead of their May 16 sentencing. ""Both of you know the sentence I pass on 16 May is likely to be measured by a considerable period of custody,"" he said at the trial. Nicole Hepburn from the Crown Prosecution Service said that Phythian and Marke were ""exposed as the true liars"" in the case, after the victims initially reported the pair years after the abuse began. ""This abuse may have occurred some years ago, but that makes it no less serious and nor is it a barrier to justice,"" Hepburn continued, according to the BBC. ""I would encourage anyone who has been abused in the past to come forward with the knowledge that the CPS will take your case seriously.""

5/13/2022,"Asked on Fox News to explain his recently revealed praise of President Joe Biden on Jan. 6, 2021, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) predictably resorted to criticizing Biden and flattering Donald Trump. On Tuesday, CNN aired audio of Graham speaking to New York Times reporter Jonathan Martin in the hours after the Capitol riot. During the exchange, Graham said the country would eventually move on from the incident and realize “we’re better than this.” He added that Biden would likely be the best person to lead the country forward. “Yeah, totally, he’ll be maybe the best person to have, right? I mean, how mad can you get at Joe Biden?” he said in the recording. Graham was pressed on the comments Thursday during an appearance on “Jesse Watters Primetime.” “Joe Biden. The best person to have? Do you really believe that?” Watters asked him. Graham said “I was wrong.” “I’ve known Joe for 30 years,” he said. “He’s a nice guy, but he’s been a disaster as president.” He added: “This was literally happening on the day of January the 6th and I was hoping that President Biden would bring us together ... But not only has he failed to bring us together, he has made us less safe. He’s ruined our economy. All the bad guys are moving around the world.” He then pivoted to a common Republican refrain, suggesting that Trump projected more strength on the global stage. “They didn’t do this on Trump’s watch because they were afraid of him,” he said. “Nobody fears Joe Biden abroad, and at home his policies are failing.” Watters left the questioning at that, though he swiped at Graham for “speaking to New York Times reporters.” “If I was a senator, I’d never do it,” Watters quipped. Graham called that “very good advice.” Graham’s feelings about the attack have apparently lessened dramatically since the day it happened, when he condemned Trump on the Senate floor, telling colleagues: “All I can say is count me out. Enough is enough.” In the following months, he reverted to sucking up to Trump. By the one-year anniversary of the siege, he was accusing Biden of “brazen politicization” of the attack. The audio was released to promote a new book, “This Will Not Pass: Trump, Biden, and the Battle for America’s Future,” authored by Martin and fellow Times reporter Alexander Burns.
