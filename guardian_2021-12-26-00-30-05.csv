12/26/2021,"The Queen looked back on a year marked by personal, as well as national, grief in her Christmas Day message – the first since the loss of her husband – yet strived to strike a more hopeful tone for the year to come. As a second year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic drew towards its end, the 95-year-old monarch said she could understand the feelings of all those who have lost loved ones, having been bereaved herself in April. Nevertheless, she looked forward becoming the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum jubilee – 70 years on the throne – in 2022.  “Although it’s a time of great happiness and good cheer for many, Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. This year, especially, I understand why,” the Queen said in her annual televised address. She wore the same sapphire chrysanthemum brooch as on her honeymoon in 1947, and displayed a framed picture of her and Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, on their 60th wedding anniversary. Her Majesty told the nation that she had drawn great comfort from the “warmth and affection” shown in the tributes to the Duke of Edinburgh’s life. “His sense of service, intellectual curiosity and capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation were all irrepressible. That mischievous, enquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him,” she added. She also spoke fondly of Princes Charles and William, and their families, for their shared focus on climate change. But there was no reference – either on screen or by name during the nine-minute broadcast – to her middle son Prince Andrew or Harry and Meghan; the trio having recently stepped back from royal duties. The personal message is particularly apt given the upheaval many families have experienced during another year affected by coronavirus. The Queen acknowledged the impact of the Omicron variant, having cancelled her regular trip to Sandringham in order to spend Christmas at Windsor. She was joined on the day by Charles and Camilla, Clarence House announced. The Queen, whose speech was recorded in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, said: “While Covid again means we can’t celebrate quite as we may have wished, we can still enjoy the many happy traditions.” She added: “I am sure someone somewhere today will remark that Christmas is a time for children. It’s an engaging truth, but only half the story. Perhaps it’s truer to say that Christmas can speak to the child within us all. Adults, when weighed down with worries, sometimes fail to see the joy in simple things, where children do not. “And, for me and my family, even with one familiar laugh missing this year, there will be joy in Christmas, as we have the chance to reminisce and see anew the wonder of the festive season through the eyes of our young children; of whom we were delighted to welcome four more this year.” The Queen also hinted at the prospect of reuniting with loved ones in the new year. She said: “February, just six weeks from now, will see the start of my Platinum Jubilee year, which I hope will be an opportunity for people everywhere to enjoy a sense of togetherness … and also to look ahead with confidence.” And she added that, next summer, the nation will host the Commonwealth Games. “The baton is currently travelling the length and breadth of the Commonwealth, heading towards Birmingham, a beacon of hope on its journey. It will be a chance to celebrate the achievements of athletes and the coming-together of like-minded nations,” she said. The Queen concluded: “I wish you all a very happy Christmas.” The speech was broadcast hours after the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived for their annual morning service at St George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle, without the Queen. It is understood the Queen’s absence from the service is a personal choice and follows a precautionary approach seen over the past six months. The service, which is ticketed, is attended by residents of the Windsor estate and members of the chapel congregation. Charles and Camilla were joined by the Earl and Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester.",News/UK news,The Queen strikes a hopeful tone in personal Christmas message,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/25/the-queen-strikes-a-hopeful-tone-in-personal-christmas-message
12/26/2021,"Most people were keen to leave 2020 behind but had I known what was coming in 2021, I might have chosen to stay there. From the first days of January I started to experience extended bouts of dizziness – a feeling that the ground was moving beneath me, with bursts of tinnitus, nausea and head pressure thrown in. One thing I can tell you about near constant dizziness is that it’s not the ideal state to be in if you are trying to homeschool a four-year-old, entertain a stir-crazy one-year-old and hold down a full-time job. As for fun activities: just looking at a playground roundabout was enough to send me spinning out.  I have a dormant blood cancer and my doctors were concerned that these symptoms could be a sign that it was developing. By September, I was travelling regularly into central London for various tests: blood work, ultrasound scans and the always-good-for-a-laugh bone marrow biopsy, in which a nurse forces a needle inside your hip bone to suck out the insides. None of these tests were as bad as the fear of what the results might bring. Dealing with all this after 18 months of the pandemic had made me somewhat dejected. Then one day, turning my head (dizzily) towards Trafalgar Square, I saw it – Heather Phillipson’s sculpture The End, on the fourth plinth. A giant dollop of cartoon cream that appeared to have splatted down on top of the plinth during lockdown when nobody was looking. From my angle I couldn’t really see the fly that sits on top, nor the drone hovering at the cherry – it was just a big, sweet treat sitting cheerily among the greying war generals and their horses. I forgot about the impending long needles and went to sit with it for five minutes, grinning at the sheer absurdity of its existence. “The impression of something being dumped from the stratosphere was a key part of the sculpture’s genesis,” says Phillipson when we are in touch by email. “I was sensing not only how it would land conceptually, but also, simply, visually – brazenly – among all that statuary.” The sculpture, there until spring 2022, is not called The End for nothing. For all its vibrant appearance, the cream can be seen as a metaphor for an increasingly unstable world. The drone speaks to the technological creep upending our lives, and as for the fly? Well, the work was conceived before the pandemic, but it couldn’t have landed on the plinth at a better time. The germy little insect seems to be saying: “Enjoy this tempting treat and you might get sick.” Yet these bleak undertones were not what resonated with me as I made my regular pilgrimages to see The End en route to the hospital. The tests would eventually come back stable and the dizziness was attributed to ongoing migraine-related issues. But while everything hung in the air, I embraced the cherry-topped cream’s most immediate and surface-level meaning: a little burst of joy in what had been a long, gloomy year.",Lifestyle/Life and style,The person who got me through 2021: Heather Phillipson’s sculpture brightened my trips to hospital,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/25/the-person-who-got-me-through-2021-heather-phillipsons-sculpture-brightened-my-trips-to-hospital
12/26/2021,"Thomas Anderson (Keanu Reeves) is the designer of The Matrix, a popular video game set in a virtual reality. His bosses have ordered a sequel; at an ideas meeting, his colleagues throw around a few ideas. PVC. Guns. Trans allegory. There is much winking and nudging in Lana Wachowski’s follow-up to the groundbreaking sci-fi films she co-created with her sister Lilly. Wachowski understands that in the 20 years since, their legacy has been boiled down to a catalogue of memes with lucrative franchise potential. Yet her newest chapter manages to be self-aware (at times overly so) without being entirely cynical. Those foggy on the details of the trilogy’s plot will benefit from the exposition-heavy first act. Plagued by memories of his past, Anderson – also known as Neo – must once again choose whether to take the red pill offered by hacker Bugs (Jessica Henwick, whip-smart), and wake up, or continue to swallow his current reality. Carrie-Anne Moss’s Tiffany, a motorcycle mechanic and mother of two whom Neo remembers as Trinity, has a choice to make too. The romance between them has always been the molten core of the Matrix films; their power as a duo is what drives the story forward.  The actors’ chemistry remains flammable. “I’ve had dreams that weren’t just dreams,” he tells her. “You mean dreams that come true?” she replies. The film is a utopian riff on the apocalyptic source material, a Technicolor reimagining flooded with light and optimism. From the sun-dappled cinematography to the primary colours worn by Morpheus (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), this world feels liberated from the oppressive green of computer code associated with the original.",Arts/Film,The Matrix Resurrections review – Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss spark in utopian reboot,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/25/the-matrix-resurrections-review-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss

Born into an Orthodox Jewish family in Manchester in 1985, she studied history and politics at Nottingham University and worked at the Daily Telegraph and LBC before joining the BBC in 2014, as a presenter on Radio 5 live. She lives in London with her husband and three-year-old son. This month, Barnett was named interviewer of the year at the British journalism awards and her new series Emma Meets… starts on Bloomberg QuickTake on 6 January.  Trading Station: How Hot Drinks Shape Our Lives (Manchester Art Gallery) This exhibition tells the story of tea, coffee and hot chocolate, touching on histories of slavery and colonisation, but also looking at the social movement around these drinks. It shows women coming together over cups of tea – some of the first times that women were able to be out together, unaccompanied, were in tea houses. I loathe coffee and all the pomp around it, but I adore tea. I love having a tea with friends, and it’s incredibly important for me at work – that first cup when I’m writing or reading scripts. Indecent (Menier Chocolate Factory) This is one of the best things I’ve ever seen. It’s about a play called The God of Vengeance, written by a Polish-Jewish playwright, which made it to Broadway in the 1920s. It centres on a lesbian relationship, which was scandalous at the time and led to the play being taken off Broadway. I went because Maureen Lipman told me it’d be the worst thing if I didn’t go, and you tend to do what Maureen Lipman says. I’m so glad I did. I found it incredibly moving as well as entertaining. Tetris You’re going to laugh at this one, but I started playing Tetris again. I recently rediscovered, to my huge delight, my Gameboy from 1993 and it’s still working. But I’m not playing Tetris on that; I downloaded it on to my phone and I’m loving it. I really zone out to it, and I love a bit of competition with myself. It’s changed quite a lot over the years – it’s in colour now, and you can tweak the settings – but it’s great. I was an extremely good Tetris player back in the day and I’m hoping to regain that calibre. There Is Nothing for You Here by Fiona Hill This is one of the best books I’ve read in a long time. Hill was a Russia adviser to Trump, and before that Obama. The chapter title that best describes [the book] is “From the Coal House to the White House” – Hill’s father was a miner in County Durham. There’s been a lot since the 2019 election about trying to understand the red wall and the political shifts that have happened, and somehow this book just manages to take it all in. It’s so much more than an insider’s guide to the White House. A Very British Scandal (BBC One) I was lucky enough to be able to watch this early (it premieres on Boxing Day) because I interviewed [its star] Claire Foy for Woman’s Hour. It tells the story of the Duchess of Argyll, Margaret Campbell, who has been described as the first woman to be slut-shamed by the British media over a court case about adultery. She was named “the Dirty Duchess” and judged in all sorts of ways that her husband wasn’t. There’s loads of comedy as well as pathos and heartache, and Claire Foy is magnificent in it. Why Don’t You by Cleo Sol A friend told me about this British singer-songwriter and I listened to her for the first time this year. I love the way her music sounds – the song Why Don’t You in particular – and she has a beautiful voice. It sounds like she’s talking to you and the lyrics are all quite pointed. But I was also really drawn by her artist profile image on Spotify: she’s lying back with her baby on her chest, not smiling but looking pensive.

12/26/2021,"Other people! We stepped – some hesitantly, others pell-mell – back outside last spring. Even if summer and autumn 2021 often felt like a cautious return to normalish (terms and conditions very much applied), amps were dusted down, guitar techs tuned up and Portaloos could not be hired for love nor money as audiences and artists once again met IRL to exchange CO2. For every summer festival that went ahead, though, it felt like two were cancelled. The live music industry cried out for government-backed insurance schemes; these came very late in the day. Glastonbury went online, but glitched; Kano, Idles and Thom Yorke’s new project the Smile nonetheless made memories. Indoor venues reopened; the practice of being politely frisked for your Covid status became just another part of going out.  The future kept arriving at pace: popular under lockdown, live streams remained an evolving fixture, many of them reinventing the live spectacle as they went. K-pop superstars BTS probably monopolised the most eyeballs, but in a crowded field, three more stood out: Bob Dylan’s stunning, smoke-filled Shadow Kingdom; Bicep’s retina-melting graphic introduction to Isles from London’s Saatchi Gallery; and St Vincent’s glitzy, sepia Down and Out Downtown. Non-fungible tokens became a trending search term: somewhere between a digital work of art and betting on crypto, NFTs generated cash for some forward-facing artists (Grimes and Kings of Leon among them); for smaller names, not so much. There was some encouraging news for the medium-sized artist, however. Hopes that the streaming model – under which artists are currently paid a pittance – might be reformed, at least in the UK, was sparked by an extensive cross-party Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport inquiry calling for a “complete reset” of the economics of streaming remuneration. Almost as important as the streaming platforms themselves, as a shopfront for music, was TikTok, where memes, dance crazes and fan-generated creative reuses made reputations daily (such as the UK’s PinkPantheress) and gave old tracks (Little Simz’s Venom, say, or Salt-N-Pepa and En Vogue’s Whatta Man) new leases of life. Hand in hand with the new came blasts from the past. Get Back was a groundbreaking deep-dive documentary that threw back the veil on the Beatles’ final weeks in 1969, laying bare their creative process and inter-relationships. Summer of Soul, Questlove’s equally unmissable documentary about the 1969 Harlem Cultural festival, also made use of extraordinary vault footage and featured electrifying performances from everyone from Nina Simone to Sly and the Family Stone. While pop continued to throw out fresh sensations – welcome Olivia Rodrigo, pop-punk adjacent chanteuse of teen heartbreak, who bossed charts either side of the Atlantic – the old-school album could still shift dials. Abba returned in fantastic voice after nearly 40 years. Force majeure Adele, meanwhile, came back with 30, a full-throated, grownup record about female unhappiness and its remedies. Her desire to not settle for a life of quiet desperation was echoed in the indie sphere by Rebecca Lucy Taylor’s equally powerful second album as Self Esteem. And behind the scenes, one camera-shy talent came into his own: Adele’s was one of a number of records this year in which shadowy but tireless London producer Dean Josiah Cover, AKA Inflo, had a hand (Sault’s Nine and Little Simz’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert were the other two headline-grabbers, not forgetting Cleo Sol’s Mother). A couple of very 21st-century US artists proved they weren’t mere flashes in the pan. Emotive and thought-provoking albums came from made-over Gen-Z siren Billie Eilish and genre-slaying, LGBTQ+ mischief-maker Lil Nas X. Dave’s second album, the pandemic-referencing, self-examining We’re All Alone in This Together, maintained the high bar of his first. Whether going deaf in public with friends once again, or the communities self-generating on TikTok, togetherness proved a mighty weapon this year. A case in point: Britney Spears’s conservatorship ended, with empowered fan activism widely credited as the irresistible force that pushed over the immovable legal object. 1 .

12/26/2021,"According to Dame Maureen Lipman, comedy is in a terrible state. “It’s in the balance whether we’re ever going to be funny again,” she told the Today programme on Radio 4, in a segment tied to a YouGov poll that found that many people censor their beliefs when meeting strangers. (Shocking that more people don’t introduce themselves with their full voting history and a row about immigration.) Lipman gravely asserted that “we’re on the cusp of wiping out comedy”. Poor old comedy, now consigned to reclining permanently on a chaise longue, having swooned at the thought of causing offence one too many times. Poor old comedy, hooked up to the life-support machine, fighting off the virus of cancel culture. It’s 50/50: will we ever laugh again? There are plenty of arguments that continue to be made about cancel culture and whether it is real or imagined, by plenty of people who are smarter than I am, though it’s worth noting that many of the most successful comedians seem to grumble about it from their thrones of solid gold.  The right to cause offence is, in some ways, a separate issue, one that balances finely on questions of power and taste. But the idea that comedy could disappear as a result of comedians being afraid to say whatever they want to say is a strange one for anyone who watches much comedy, particularly in a live setting. The live comedy spirit, more outrageous, more provocative, may not be making its way on to our screens in swaths, but that has always been the case. Television is often less risky than the live arena, because audiences are bigger and broader and that must be factored in. Perhaps it’s falling into the trap, nevertheless, to list TV comedies that are clever and witty and leave you with the sense of a boundary pushed or a line crossed, but when I watch Alma’s Not Normal or Ladhood or PEN15 or We Are Lady Parts, I never get the impression that they are holding much back. The bedfellow to poor comedy is the “it wouldn’t get made now” line, the equivalent of “it was better in my day”, usually used to complain about one trend in modern comedy, to punch up rather than punch down. I suspect many older shows I love would not be made now, but many shows that I love now would not have been made 20 years ago. Comedy evolves, changes, adapts, follows trends until it bucks them. Someone discharge comedy and free up the bed: the prognosis is that it’s absolutely fine. While I do love an end-of-year list, deadlines mean that most of them are compiled in late November and so anything with a December-ish release date is probably going to miss out on the accolades. One such show is Dopesick, which came to an end on Disney+ last week and went straight into my own belated personal top 10. This harrowing drama series, starring Michael Keaton as a doctor in an Appalachian community that is all but wiped out by oxycontin abuse, has been outstanding, a furious and infuriating indictment of Purdue Pharma, the Sackler family and the repulsive profiteering of huge corporations, at the cost of hundreds of thousands of lives. Keaton, who is having a fine late career, is wonderful, and though it is not an easy watch, I would recommend it for those with a strong constitution and a few hours to spare. I tend to use end-of-year lists as a catch-up guide for what I should watch during the Christmas holidays, so in case you do the same and any of the following may have dropped off your radar, I can also recommend this lot. In My Skin, on iPlayer, is a brilliant, funny, heartbreaking drama about a teenage girl, her tough family life and mental illness, which might not sound like a festive joy, but is utterly beautiful. Landscapers, starring Olivia Colman (you may have heard of her), is an inventive drama quite unlike anything else around, and also on Sky is Yellowjackets, a dream for fans of 90s film stars and horror and survival series. Too late for the lists, but well worth a look. I did not know that I was an Alt-J fan until recently, but their single U&ME has been one of my favourites of the year. A news story about the band’s drummer, Thom Sonny Green, then caught my eye, as he has spent a lot of the pandemic shielding, but has said that he has decided he will be rejoining the band on tour from February. “Who knows what will happen if I catch Covid again? But anything I have to do to get back out on stage, I’ll do it,” he told the BBC. One of my unexpected highlights of 2021 was going to see Fontaines DC on a whim, in Manchester, finding myself in a room filled with 3,000 people for the first time since early 2020. As the band powered through their opening song, shouting “life ain’t always empty” on repeat, you could feel the crackle of energy rippling through the room. Music has been treated appallingly by this government during the pandemic and live music is once again on a precipice, but when it’s back, music reminds you of its sheer vitality and power. I had not known just how much I’d missed it. Green’s urgent need to be with the band on tour is completely human.

12/26/2021,"A major Tory donor who backed Boris Johnson before the last election has openly questioned whether he should survive as Conservative leader, as another poll confirmed a clear poll lead for Labour. John Caudwell, the billionaire founder of Phones4U who handed the Tories £500,000 before the last election, said he had been hugely disappointed by “the mistakes and faux pas” made by No 10 and said he did not know if Johnson could or should lead the party into the next election.  With Tory MPs openly speculating about who might replace Johnson, Caudwell said he had been particularly alarmed by Johnson’s initial attempt to protect former cabinet minister Owen Paterson from punishment after he was found to have lobbied ministers. “What really concerns me is this sleaze issue and him not standing firmly enough against what’s gone on,” he told the Observer. “I was unbelievably disappointed when I heard him almost defending and ... trying to find an out for Owen Paterson. [However,] I like him as a charismatic leader. It’s a very, very positive thing to have somebody who feels down to earth, so I like Boris from that point of view. “I’m not sure he can survive this, and I’m not even sure he should survive it. If he cleaned his act up and made it clear to MPs that they cannot take money from other sources, and started trying to get the government on a very ethical, whiter-than-white basis, I guess I would still support him. But I suppose the question you’ve really got to answer is, is it in his character to do so?” Caudwell also warned he would not continue to support the party should it continue to be hit by allegations of sleaze. “Whoever can rule this country properly, in my view, I will vote for,” he said. “I’m not a dyed-in-the-wool Conservative that will stay Conservative. I will vote for anybody that I believe has got the right set of principles to keep Britain great. The Conservative party can’t take my support for granted.” It comes as the latest Opinium poll for the Observer found that Labour retains a comfortable seven-point lead over the Tories following controversies over Paterson, the refurbishment of the prime minister’s Downing St flat and various claims of lockdown parties in Whitehall and No 10. Labour is on 39% of the vote, with the Tories on 32%. The prime minister’s personal approval ratings continue to be in the doldrums at -31%, though it is an improvement from the record low of -35% recorded two weeks ago. Some 24% approve of the job he is doing, with 55% disapproving. Keir Starmer’s approval rating stands at +4%, the highest since the end of April. Starmer has also taken the lead on who voters see as the best prime minister, leading 30% to 24% over Johnson. However, still both trail the 34% who opted for “none of these”. After a similar lead a fortnight ago, it represents the strongest run of leads on this question Opinium has shown for Starmer. While Caudwell said he did not think there was an obvious successor to Johnson, he criticised chancellor Rishi Sunak for his handling of the economy during the Covid crisis, arguing that the furlough scheme had made some people better off while ignoring others. He also praised Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, seen as a frontrunner to replace Johnson. “When you’re thinking about a new leader, there’s nobody that actually strikes me as being the right person,” he said. “I think Liz Truss could be that person. Rishi is very popular among a lot of the country because he has put money in people’s pockets. Has he done it really intelligently and got the best results out of my tax pounds? No, he hasn’t. Without doubt, he has not done that. “I’ve not been extremely complimentary about the Conservative party these last two years. But I still believe that it’s the best party to run this country, and I’d be terrified of the Lib Dems getting in and even more terrified of Labour.” Caudwell said he had held talks with the chancellor about his own plans for helping Britain through the pandemic, including investing in future infrastructure, green industry and apprenticeships. He also called on billionaires to add their name to a commitment to give away the vast majority of their wealth. “At the moment, there’s too few,” he said. “Governments need to do everything in their power to encourage people’s voluntary philanthropic giving in that way. Because what difference would it make to me, Jeff Bezos, or Elon Musk, or any of them to pledge their wealth? You don’t need to give it away until you die. And if you decide to give most of it away before, then you’ve got the privilege and the pride of making a huge difference to people’s lives. Why would you not do it? I can’t even begin to comprehend why people don’t do that.”",News/Politics,Billionaire Tory backer turns against Johnson following sleaze and scandals,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/25/billionaire-tory-backer-turns-against-johnson-following-sleaze-and-scandals
12/26/2021,"When Scarlet Davies first saw deaf actor Rose Ayling-Ellis on Strictly Come Dancing , she felt inspired. “Rose has had such a massive impact on young people,” said the 15-year-old, who is also deaf. “She reinforces the message that we shouldn’t let other people dictate to us because of our deafness.” Davies, who lives in Hertfordshire with her family and wants to be a teacher, said Ayling-Ellis made her “feel that I don’t need to worry about my deafness getting in the way of my future. She also makes me believe that I can do anything in life and my deafness will never stop me.”  New research carried out in the wake of Ayling-Ellis’s victory on the BBC One show last weekend shows more than three-quarters of deaf children think the programme has given the public a better understanding of deafness. A survey of deaf children and their families by the National Deaf Children’s Society also found that Ayling-Ellis’s visibility led to two-thirds of deaf children feeling more confident about wearing their hearing aids, with seven in 10 saying they felt happier talking about their own deafness. Alongside her professional dance partner, Giovanni Pernice, Ayling-Ellis was crowned winner of the celebrity dance competition, despite being able to hear only parts of the music and keeping time by counting beats. The 27-year-old actor, who plays Frankie Lewis in EastEnders, has been praised for being open about her disability and for using British Sign Language (BSL) with Pernice, who learned the basics in order to be able to communicate with her. Interest in learning BSL has now exploded, thanks to Strictly, with some teaching centres reporting waiting lists for BSL courses. Figures support this increase in visibility: Google searches for BSL rose substantially during Strictly and, according to numbers from Signature, an awarding organisation for deaf communication qualifications, searches for local BSL courses more than doubled in 2021, compared with 2020.In particular, the pair’s routine in week eight created a surge in interest in learning BSL. Performed to the song Symphony by Clean Bandit featuring the Swedish singer Zara Larsson, the dance featured a silent section where the music cut out, giving non-deaf viewers an indication of what life can be like for some deaf people. Martin McLean, senior policy advisor at the National Deaf Children’s Society, said Ayling-Ellis’s winning run “helped put paid to lots of misconceptions about deaf people”, which “has meant a huge amount to deaf children and young people everywhere”. He said: “What’s important now is keeping this going because increased awareness and understanding of deafness can only be a good thing.” McLean urged people to take on board tips for communicating with deaf people, such as asking how they communicate, facing them when talking and never saying things such as “It doesn’t matter” or “I’ll tell you later”. He said: “It really will make a big difference next time they speak to a deaf child or young person. A little deaf awareness goes a very long way.” Lindsay Foster, the executive director of Signature, said the awareness raised was not only about the barriers and challenges that Ayling-Ellis overcame but “also the way in which Giovanni has embraced it”. She said: “His understanding and passion for learning alongside Rose has been thrilling to watch, and to see him using BSL on the show and with Rose really does show an outstanding commitment. “They have inspired so many people to think about learning and they have shown what a fun and engaging language it is.”The Department for Education recently confirmed it would be holding a public consultation at the start of next year on the possibility of launching a new GCSE in sign language, despite a moratorium on new subjects. The GCSE is being piloted in six schools, mostly in south-east England. Foster added: “With the potential for a GCSE in BSL within the next few years, we hope the momentum continues to improve communication for all.”",News/Society,Rose Ayling-Ellis’s Strictly Come Dancing win gives deaf children huge confidence boost,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/25/rose-ayling-elliss-strictly-come-dancing-win-gives-deaf-children-huge-confidence-boost
