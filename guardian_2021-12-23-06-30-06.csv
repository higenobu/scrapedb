12/23/2021," An article (PM rules out further curbs on Christmas socialising, 22 December, p1) said the Covid self-isolation period will be cut from 10 days to seven for vaccinated people if they record negative lateral flow tests on days six and seven. The UK Health Security Agency later clarified that this would also apply to unvaccinated people, although the 10-day period would still apply to those who were not fully vaccinated if they were a close contact of someone who had tested positive. A second article was also updated to add the UKHSA clarification.

12/23/2021,"Atlético Madrid lost their fourth La Liga match in a row as Granada fought back to earn a 2-1 win over the defending champions. João Félix fired Atlético ahead with a perfect low shot from the edge of the box after just two minutes, demonstrating why the fans had been urging Simeone to play the Portuguese forward more regularly.  Granada equalised 15 minutes later with a stupendous long shot from Darwin Machís. The Venezuelan winger cut in from the left and fired a shot beyond Jan Oblak from 20 yards out. Midway through the second half, the hosts went ahead after Jorge Molina beat Oblak to a cross, with the goal awarded after a VAR check. Despite the best efforts of the indefatigable Félix, Atlético could not find a second goal, falling to their worst league run since Simeone became manager 10 years ago. Atléti stay in fifth, 14 points behind Real Madrid who play later on Wednesday. Serie A leaders Internazionale extended their winning league run to seven matches as Denzel Dumfries scored the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Torino. Dutch international defender Dumfries struck after 30 minutes, coolly finishing off a counter-attack that started on the edge of the Inter box for his second goal in two games. Mid-table Torino put up a strong challenge, with Sasa Lukic’s free kick forcing a sharp save from Samir Handanovic, but could not find a way through at San Siro as Simone Inzaghi’s side kept a sixth consecutive league clean sheet. *It was an important win, we knew that Torino are a difficult team to face,” Inzaghi told Dazn. “We knew about their ferocious pressing and that they would try to disrupt our game. We played a great match and barely risked anything. We are very satisfied with how we have ended the year.” Elsewhere, Manolo Gabbiadini’s equaliser earned Sampdoria a 1-1 draw at Roma. Eldor Shomurodov’s clinical finish had put José Mourinho’s side in front at the Stadio Olimpico but Gabbiadini struck 10 minutes from time to leave Mourinho frustrated. “It was an ugly game, because the side that wanted to win it didn’t play well, and the side that didn’t want to win played the way they did and got rewarded for that with a point,” the under-fire Roma manager said after the match. Lazio are eighth and a point behind Roma after winning 3-1 at Venezia. Pedro put Maurizio Sarri’s side ahead in the third minute with a weaving solo run and finish, but Francesco Forte headed struggling Venezia level before half-time. Francesco Acerbi restored Lazio’s lead early in the second half and substitute Luis Alberto volleyed home a third in stoppage time. Fiorentina are sandwiched between the two clubs from the capital after Gaetano Castrovilli scored with a diving header in the 81st minute to earn a point at Verona. Aaron Hickey was on target for Bologna, sweeping home emphatically from the edge of the area as they won 3-0 at Sassuolo.",Sport/Football,"European roundup: Atlético stunned by Granada, Inter extend winning run",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/22/atletico-madrid-granada-inter-milan-napoli-real-madrid-psg
