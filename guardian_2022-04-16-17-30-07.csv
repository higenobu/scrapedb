4/16/2022,"Following The Masked Singer and Starstruck, this is another talent show with a bizarre but cheery premise: singers try to bag a date by winning over fellow singletons with a karaoke song. The two matched couples then go off on a date to, err, learn a duet together, which they perform to the studio audience – and the pair who win the vote go on another date. Former Strictly Come Dancing professional Oti Mabuse is a woman we all want to be best pals with, so it’s worth giving her first presenting gig a chance. Hollie Richardson If you know a thing or two about Jeeves & Wooster, pedigree cat breeds, Oasis and Ricky Hatton, you might fare well on tonight’s show. Pat Nevin, Anna Nightingale, Tom Malone Jr and Roo Irvine are the celebrities taking to the chair with their specialist topics, with Clive Myrie firing questions at them. HR The Titanic was a magnificent feat of engineering, before Mother Nature crept up on her one icy April night. This one-off documentary uses original blueprints, unseen archive and special effects to tell the story of how 15,000 workers built this state-of-the-art floating city in Belfast. Ali Catterall After taking a year off, Ant and Dec bring back the long-running talent contest, with Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams in the judges’ seats. The first round of auditions sees a harmonious choir, a dog like no other and a very spooky man. Business as usual, then. HR Glyn is suspicious of his brother’s activities, as another death ricochets through the community. Cadi has a lot on: finding a replacement before she transfers, and awkward run-ins with Rachel. Will they work things out before next week’s finale? Henry Wong The poised and blackly comic assassin thriller has always thrived on shocking and grisly deaths, and with the last ever episode looming it feels as if major characters are fair game. For now, though, Villanelle is laying low on the remote Scottish island claimed by her survivalist rival, Gunn, while the rudderless Eve seeks solace in some karaoke. Graeme Virtue Mandy, 12.45am, Film4 This bizarre 2018 film is another staging post in the cult renaissance of Nicolas Cage – one that will probably reach its apogee this Friday with the release of The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent, a comedy in which he stars as himself. Here, director Panos Cosmatos plunges Cage into a phantasmagorical revenge horror – part giallo, part S&M nightmare. He plays lumberjack Red, living in rural bliss with artist partner Mandy (Andrea Riseborough), until a messianic cult turns up and its leader, Linus Roache’s Jeremiah, takes a shine to her. An exercise in extreme gothic style, it’s gory and gobsmacking, with a near-silent Cage at the top of his psychotic game. Simon Wardell I Blame Society, 11pm, Film4 Gillian Wallace Horvat’s gleeful mockumentary is part satire on cinematic authenticity and part Lady Vengeance-tinged horror. After being told she’d make a good murderer, struggling but overly self-confident Los Angeles indie film-maker Gillian (Wallace Horvat) documents herself putting the theory into practice, step by ever more bloody step. You can see all this as a metaphor for the cut-throat nature of the movie business, but it’s also a glorious black comedy about finding your calling and really going for it.

4/16/2022,"Well-heeled punters are shelling out up to £25,000 for luxury glamping packages at UK music festivals this summer. If you have plenty of cash, you don’t have to worry about digging out that shabby two-person tent from under the stairs. At some festivals there are an array of upmarket accommodation options available ranging from yurts, tipis and Bedouin-style tents to “Gypsy caravans”, wooden cabins and railway carriages – although quite a few are already fully booked. It shows that while the cost of living crisis may be biting hard, after two pandemic-blighted years, there are clearly plenty of music fans with money who are determined to spend whatever it takes to have a good time this summer. Equally, if you are keen to get to a festival but money is tight, there are dozens of cheaper and free events around, some of which have pretty decent lineups. This is being lauded as the year when music festivals will “return with bells on” after 2020’s wipeout and 2021’s patchy turnout. The season kicks off next month with the Great Escape (11-14 May), when hundreds of up-and-coming bands from around the world take over Brighton’s bars, nightclubs and concert halls for a few days. Scores of events will then take place, including biggies such as Glastonbury in June, Latitude festival in Suffolk in July and the Reading and Leeds festival in August, before the party finally winds up in September, with End Of The Road in Dorset probably the last of the big events. Music festivals certainly haven’t been immune to the soaring inflation that has affected so many aspects of our lives. Last year a weekend ticket to Reading festival – whose 2022 headliners include Arctic Monkeys, Megan Thee Stallion and Dave – had a face value cost of £215, whereas this year it is £240. Or £261.95 once you add on the inescapable fees. It is on 26-28 August. Meanwhile, Glastonbury tickets for 2022 cost £280 (plus a £5 booking fee). In 2019, the last time the event took place, the face value price was £248. It runs from 22-26 June, and the main headliners this year are Billie Eilish, Paul McCartney and Kendrick Lamar. The cost of a ticket to one of those two events or Latitude – which is this year charging £235.20, plus fees for the 21-24 July weekend, with acts including Lewis Capaldi, Foals and Snow Patrol – has increased by an average of almost 18% over the past five years. However, a quick go on an inflation calculator indicates the figure for the typical increase in the cost of goods and services in the UK over this period is actually higher: about 22%. Many festivals offer more upmarket accommodation options for those looking for something a little – or a lot – more luxurious. Often there will also be companies offering pop-up glamping in nearby fields, although you may find these are not authorised or endorsed by the festival. Tickets to the event itself are typically not included in the price. Glastonbury offers a few of its own options, including tipis that can accommodate up to six adults and cost £1,150 to hire, although at the time of writing these were fully booked. However, as you might expect, there are plenty of companies targeting Glastonbury attenders with deep pockets. The Pop-Up Hotel offers a range of packages including the Tenthouse Suite, which costs from £24,999 for eight people. That particular option – a giant luxury tent with four fully furnished bedrooms, a bathroom with shower, flushing toilet and basin, and a large furnished living and dining area – was at the time of writing sold out but the firm’s website features plenty of others, including the Raj Tenthouse Suite. When we looked at that, for eight adults to stay there for five nights, arriving on 22 June, you would pay £20,997. Other options include a repurposed railway carriage costing from £7,499 for two people, and a Gypsy caravan priced from £3,999 for two people. The Pop-Up Hotel accommodation is not on the festival site – it says it is a 10-minute walk to one of the main gates. Other companies offering luxury packages aimed at Glastonbury-goers include Yurtel, which has Bedouin-style tents, huts and other options costing up to £12,750, plus VAT and offers a bespoke travel service including “helicopter and chauffeur planning”; and Hotel Ziggu, whose priciest option appears to be the Lotus Mahal, a grand-looking giant tent that sleeps up to eight and costs £10,500 to hire for five nights. Latitude is another of the festivals where a number of luxury accommodation options are available, including shiny Airstream trailers (Pink Moon Camping offers these at Latitude, at £3,200 for the weekend but at the time of writing they were sold out). Glastonbury’s website says anyone thinking of booking unofficial off-site camping needs to be aware “we are not responsible for them and cannot guarantee they won’t let you down”. Some festivals offer payment plans, allowing people to spread the cost over several months. Meanwhile, if you are not wedded to a particular event, there will almost certainly be some special offers, including perhaps some two-for-one deals, as we get nearer to summer. Monitor the websites of the main ticketing companies such as Ticketmaster, check out the festival online forums and keep a lookout for offer emails. If you can’t afford the hefty sums that some of the higher-profile festivals charge, there are a number of low- and no-cost events taking place this year. However, some festivals that were previously free now charge, and some free events – such as Walthamstow Garden Party in London – aren’t taking place this summer. Here’s our pick of the events: The African music festival Africa Oyé in Sefton Park, Liverpool, on 18-19 June. Free entry, and a lineup including Oumou Sangaré, Fuse ODG and Kanda Bongo Man. Festival Too – a free, unticketed event held in King’s Lynn, Norfolk, over three weekends: 25-26 June, 1-2 July and 8-9 July. More details to be confirmed. Marti Pellow and Cast were among the acts who played in 2019. Coventry’s Godiva festival in War Memorial Park on 2-4 September. This used to be free but now you have to pay. Last year – when acts playing included Craig David and Supergrass – tickets cost £17.50 for an adult for the weekend, or £12.50 for early birds. Ticket and lineup details are yet to be announced. Rochdale Feel Good festival in Greater Manchester on 13 August. Entry to indoor stages in venues will be free, while accessing the main stage headlined by the Fratellis involves buying a £7 ticket. Leigh folk festival in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, on 23-26 June. Almost all the events are free, with the exception of some ticketed concerts.",Arts/Culture,"Festival finance: five days in a cold, muddy field for £25,000?",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/16/festival-finance-five-days-in-a-cold-muddy-field-for-25000

Miguel Almirón, a £20m buy on the part of Rafael Benítez, ranks among those playing for their futures. With Ryan Fraser injured, Almirón could be offered a rare start at home against Leicester as Howe aims to move a step closer to mid-table security with a win against Brendan Rodgers’s side.

4/16/2022,"Late last month, hackers made off with what was then worth more than $500m from the systems of cryptocurrency network Ronin, in what is believed to be the second-largest cryptocurrency theft on record. Ronin was a juicy target for a hacker. The blockchain project supports the wildly popular Axie Infinity video game, which with an estimated 8 million players has drawn comparisons to action-driven collecting games like Pokémon Go. Axie Infinity is hot and involves substantial sums of money. Players purchase creatures called Axies in the form of NFTs, unique digital assets known as non-fungible tokens. The creatures can breed, battle and even be exchanged for cold, hard cash. The game has swelled in popularity as players see the potential to earn real money. In 2020, one 22-year-old player from the Philippines reportedly bought two apartments in Manila with his earnings from the game. Last year, another player said he earned more through Axie Infinity and other online games than from his full-time job at Goldman Sachs. But the underpinnings of the game face significant security challenges. To play, gamers must move their money from Ethereum to Ronin on a blockchain “bridge” system. Ronin is a “sidechain” of Ethereum – a scaling solution that allows transactions to happen faster than on Ethereum, which is congested by the amount of activity it hosts. Hosting the game on this sidechain ensures it can grow without losing functionality. Bridges can hold a lot of money at once, so by targeting the Ronin Bridge that transferred players’ assets between blockchains, hackers seized control of the assets and took off with the money. The US government said this week it believes North Korean hackers are behind the heist. But it’s just the latest in a string of brazen high-profile crypto thefts. In 2018, more than $530m was stolen from the crypto exchange Coincheck. In February, hackers made off with $320m from the decentralized finance platform Wormhole (though that loot was eventually returned). And in that same month, in perhaps the most publicized cyber heist of the year, prosecutors charged odd couple Ilya “Dutch” Lichtenstein and his wife, Heather Morgan, – also known for her cringeworthy raps on TikTok under the name Razzlekhan – with conspiracy to launder billions of dollars worth of bitcoin stolen from the crypto exchange Bitfinex in 2016. It’s a trend. In 2021, $3.2bn in cryptocurrency was stolen from individuals and services, according to a crypto crime report by Chainalysis, a company that provides blockchain data and analysis to banks, governments and other businesses. (Ronin is also working with Chainalysis to trace the funds stolen in the hack, according to Reuters.) The figure is almost six times this amount stolen in 2020. So far this year, more than $1bn has already been stolen, according to experts at Chainalysis and other security firms. The high-profile hacks and substantial sums of money involved have raised questions about how vulnerable the blockchain – long considered a secure place to store assets – is to such breaches. Some experts say the rise in reports of cryptotheft come as cryptocurrency is more widely used and better understood than ever before. “You basically have a lot of money on the table, and on a very public table,” said Nicholas Christin, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University who researches online crime and computer and network security. With large sums of money publicly moving around on these transparent systems, it can be enticing for a hacker to pounce. To understand how these heists are possible, it’s important to distinguish between the blockchain and other programs that operate on top of it, experts say. The blockchain itself is a decentralized public ledger that allows for peer-to-peer transactions. It’s the foundational layer that bitcoin, Ethereum or Solana are built upon. The second layer – the one that’s frequently exploited – are smart contracts that run on top of blockchains. Smart contracts are agreements in code that automatically execute when the terms of the contract are met. The common analogy is to a digital vending machine – select a product, put in the correct amount of money, and your item will be automatically dispensed. These contracts are irreversible. The hackers weasel their way to the money through these second-layer systems by either taking advantage of bugs in the code, or getting hold of the private keys that will let them into the systems, explained Christin. Some hackers even subvert the smart contracts to redirect the funds into their hands. In the Axie Infinity hack, which targeted the Ronin Bridge, the hacker obtained enough private keys to control the bridge and drain the funds. Since so many users had their assets in the bridge, the payout was massive. “Underlying blockchain protocol is secure,” said Ronghui Gu, founder and CEO of the blockchain security firm Certik. “But the programs – the smart contracts – running on top of them are still like other normal programs, which can have software bugs and vulnerabilities.” It’s common for hackers to try to exploit the code of one of their targets. And it helps that much of the code for blockchain programs is open source, making it easily accessible for hackers who want to look over the code and find potential bugs. “In this world people say ‘in code we trust,’ but the code itself is indeed not that trustworthy,” said Gu. When he started his blockchain security firm in 2018, Gu explained, only a few companies used third-party security services like his to audit and assess their code – a critical security backstop – but he’s seen the number gradually tick up. Crypto exchanges are also major targets for hacks. Exchanges are like banks, they’re central entities that hold massive amounts of their users’ money and transactions are irreversible. Like bridges, they are a middleman program that tends to be targeted. “Those big exchanges have a huge target on their back,” said Christin. Once crypto assets are stolen it can be a challenge for thieves to cash out, especially if the heist is in the nine-figure range. That means funds are often left in limbo for years, or even indefinitely. During that time, the value of the stolen funds can fluctuate due to the volatile nature of the crypto market. The Chainalysis crypto crime report estimates that criminals are currently holding at least $10bn worth of cryptocurrency, the vast majority obtained through theft. Thanks to transparency on the blockchain, it’s possible to trace these transactions and holdings, but the identity of the perpetrator is hard to nail down until the funds are cashed out. One can look to the Bitfinex scandal as a case study in attempted laundering. “The funds didn’t move for an extremely long time. And then when they tried to initiate the laundering process, this was an opportunity for law enforcement to get involved again, because people are following these hacks,” said Kim Grauer, director of research at Chainalysis. For victims of the schemes, there are few ways to recover assets. “If a bank’s security fails, it’s not that bad for the bank,” said Ethan Heilman, a cybersecurity expert and co-founder of the cloud service BastionZero. “But if you’re a cryptocurrency exchange and someone empties out all your cryptocurrency that’s really bad for you.” Banks have measures in place to protect their clients that the blockchain lacks. If one’s credit card is stolen, insurance policies ensure that one will usually receive that money back. On the blockchain, however, transactions are irreversible – there is no undo button. That means there is a tremendous security burden on individual users to keep their assets safe. “End users may not necessarily be cognizant of the security risks that they incur,” said Christin. “Quite frankly, even people in the field don’t have time to necessarily go and review some smart contract source code.” If one entrusts their keys to the wrong second-layer intermediary, it’s possible that they could be a victim of a heist. Collectively, most aren’t used to this responsibility. Crypto companies are beginning to get more serious about security, Heilman said, but a world without hacks is not realistic, he added. “You never become secure, you just become more secure,” he said. “So given the ease of monetizing a vulnerability in one of these systems, I think that it is likely that we will continue to see things get hacked, and the question will not be, ‘is there a new hack this month?’ It will be: ‘how frequent are the hacks this month?’” “There are important things that the industry needs to overcome in order to actually really grow and scale,” said Grauer, “because you can’t have a healthy growing industry if everyone is afraid of getting hacked.”",News/Technology,"North Korea, NFTs and a hit video game: inside a $500m cryptocurrency theft",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/16/nft-blockchain-north-korea-hack-ronin-axie-infinity

Burnley fans will be left wondering whether the shiny suits at ALK Capital, for all the outward confidence of their rictus grins, have made a terrible mistake. West Ham may be coming off the back of an impressive Europa League win against Lyon but they have been inconsistent in the league recently, alternating between wins and losses for their past six games.
