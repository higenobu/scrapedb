1/27/2022,"A Tennessee school board has banned a Pulitzer prize-winning novel from its classrooms over eight curse words and an illustration of a naked cartoon mouse. The graphic novel, Maus: A Survivor’s Tale by New Yorker Art Spiegelman, uses hand-drawn illustrations of mice and cats to depict how the author’s parents survived Auschwitz during the Holocaust.  The graphic memoir elevated a pulp mass medium to high art when it nabbed a slew of literary awards in 1992 but appears not to have impressed educators in Mcminn county. Ten board members unanimously agreed in favour of removing the novel from the eighth-grade curriculum, citing its use of the phrase “God Damn” and drawings of “naked pictures” of women, according to minutes taken from a board of education meeting earlier this month. “There is some rough, objectionable language in this book,” director of school, Lee Parkison, is recorded as saying in opening the session’s opening remarks. Parkison continued to say he had “consulted with our attorney” and as a result “we decided the best way to fix or handle the language in this book was to redact it … to get rid of the eight curse words and the picture of the woman that was objected to.” Board member Tony Allman supported the move to remove the “vulgar and inappropriate” content, arguing: “We don’t need to enable or somewhat promote this stuff.” “I am not denying it was horrible, brutal, and cruel,” Allman said in reference to the genocide and murder of six million European Jews during the second world war. “It shows people hanging, it shows them killing kids, why does the educational system promote this kind of stuff? It is not wise or healthy,” he added. Allman also took aim at Spiegelman himself, alleging: “I may be wrong, but this guy that created the artwork used to do the graphics for Playboy.” “You can look at his history, and we’re letting him do graphics in books for students in elementary school. If I had a child in the eighth grade, this ain’t happening. If I had to move him out and homeschool him or put him somewhere else, this is not happening.” Mike Cochran, another school board member, described parts of the book as “completely unnecessary”. “We are talking about teaching ethics to our kids, and it starts out with the dad and the son talking about when the dad lost his virginity. It wasn’t explicit but it was in there,” Cochran said. “We don’t need this stuff to teach kids history. We can teach them history and we can teach them graphic history. We can tell them exactly what happened, but we don’t need all the nakedness and all the other stuff.” Cochran proposed revisiting the entire curriculum over concerns it was developed to “normalise sexuality, normalise nudity and normalise vulgar language.” “If I was trying to indoctrinate somebody’s kids, this is how I would do it,” he added. “You put this stuff just enough on the edges, so the parents don’t catch it but the kids, they soak it in. I think we need to relook at the entire curriculum.” There's only one kind of people who would vote to ban Maus, whatever they are calling themselves these days. https://t.co/fs1Jl62Qd8 The decision comes as conservative groups across the country are stepping up campaigns to ban books from school libraries, often focused on works that address race, LGBTQ issues or marginalized communities. The board did have some supporters with Julie Goodin, an instructional supervisor and former history teacher, and Melasawn Knight, the federal programs supervisor, backing the novel’s inclusion in the curriculum. “I think any time you are teaching something from history, people did hang from trees, people did commit suicide and people were killed, over six million were murdered. I think the author is portraying that because it is a true story about his father that lived through that,” Knight said. “I can talk of the history, I was a history teacher and there is nothing pretty about the Holocaust and for me this was a great way to depict a horrific time in history,” Goodin added. After much discussion over the redaction of words the members found objectionable, the board eventually decided that alongside copyright concerns, it would be better to ban the graphic novel altogether. Spiegelman said he was “baffled” by the outcome in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. “It’s leaving me with my jaw open, like, ‘What?’” the 73-year-old author said, adding he thought the school board was “Orwellian” for approving the ban. Spiegelman’s Jewish parents were both sent to Nazi concentration camps and his mother took her own life when he was just 20. “I’ve met so many young people who … have learned things from my book,” Spiegelman said. “I also understand that Tennessee is obviously demented. There’s something going on very, very haywire there.”",News/World news,"Tennessee school board bans Pulitzer prize-winning Holocaust novel, Maus",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/tennessee-school-board-bans-pulitzer-prize-winning-holocaust-novel-maus
1/27/2022,"One of Japan’s best-loved snacks is to go up in price – by a whopping 20% – for the first time since its launch more than four decades ago, But Umaibo – literally “delicious stick” – will still be a steal for schoolchildren at just ¥12 apiece (US10c, not including sales tax), up from the current ¥10, when the change goes into effect in April.  The crunchy corn snack’s producer, Yakoin, blamed the rising price of corn imported from the US for the hike, the first since Umaibo went on sale in 1979. Although the figures involved are tiny, the increase – less than 2c – is symbolically significant in “inflation-resistant” Japan, where firms have been reluctant to pass rising raw material costs on to consumers. Noriko Eda, a 59-year-old Tokyo resident, said she was “surprised” by the news. “Umaibo have been the same price for so long, so a ¥2 increase is a big deal.” A fellow Tokyoite, Naomi Hosaka, said it was a “bit sad” that the impact of inflationary trends in the global economy were affecting the cheapest items, including children’s treats. The cylindrical snacks, wrapped in aluminium film, come in more than a dozen flavours, many based on Japanese food, such as spicy cod roe and takoyaki octopus balls, with cream of corn soup the biggest seller. Around 700m of the sticks are sold annually – the equivalent of about five and a half for each person – both in packs and individually. Umaibo’s low price and colourful wrappers featuring its hyperactive mascot Umaemon have earned the snacks a special place in the affections of schoolchildren looking to make their pocket money go as far as possible, and among older people craving a fix of sweet-shop nostalgia. In the past, Japanese companies have countered rising costs by shrinking packages – Umaibo lost a single gram in weight in 2007 – but price increases could become a more regular occurrence. “There’s nothing we can do,” said Takeshi Nemoto, a buyer for a Tokyo snack shop. “From the manufacturer’s point of view, they can’t stay profitable unless they raise the price.” Celebrity fans mourned the looming demise of the ¥10 price tag and, possibly, the loss of Umaibo’s status as Japan’s “national snack”. “We’re witnessing a turning point in history,” tweeted rock musician Atsushi Osawa, whose band, Uchikubi Gokumon Doukoukai, referenced the snack and its “miracle” price in a 2010 song. “The price has started to diverge from the lyrics,” he said. Umaibo’s roots can be traced to central Japan, where the grandparents of Yakoin’s current president, Masahiko Sumiya, started selling shrimp crackers at their fruit and vegetable shop. His father founded the company in 1960 when he moved to Tokyo after the second world war, according to the Mainichi newspaper.

1/27/2022,"New research co-led by the director of the Doherty Institute, Prof Sharon Lewin, has found a medicine used to treat cancer can also draw HIV out of hibernation, exposing the virus to the immune system and making it more susceptible to attack. HIV’s ability to “hide” in cells, even in people on antiretroviral therapy and with undetectable amounts of the virus in their blood, is one of the significant barriers to finding a cure for the disease.  While HIV patients on antiretroviral drug treatments have no chance of passing it on and can live normal and healthy lives, the virus is never eliminated from their cells entirely. This is because a HIV reservoir “hides” in a state of hibernation in immune system cells. To destroy the virus, these cells need assistance from killer T-cells. But because these T-cells cannot detect and find the hidden HIV, they are unable to kill it. In cancer patients, killer T-cells become dysfunctional, leading them to express exhaustion proteins on their surface called PD1. Previous research by Lewin found PD1 are the same exhaustion markers which allow HIV to hide in cells. Pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy drug administered intravenously, blocks these exhaustion markers in cancer patients, allowing the killer T-cells to regain function and fight the cancer. The anti-PD1 drug has revolutionised the treatments of several cancers, including melanoma. A barrier in testing the treatment for HIV patients has been that pembrolizumab can lead to significant side-effects. “Five to 10% of people will get an adverse event from pembrolizumab,” Lewin said. “In a cancer setting this isn’t a major concern as you have a life-threatening illness, but in HIV, the situation is very different. People can now live normal and healthy lives with HIV, so any intervention for a cure must have very low toxicity.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But Lewin and her team were able to test pembrolizumab against the virus by administering it to 32 people living with HIV but who also have cancer. They found the drug did have anti-PD1 properties for HIV. Their discovery was published on Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. Until now, there had only been individual case reports to show the effect of anti-PD1 because people with HIV who also need the treatment for their cancer are very rare. And while other treatments have been shown to reverse HIV latency, anti-PD1 has the added potential to boost the immune response. “So it’s like you have a two-in-one drug,” Lewin said. Lewin’s research has proven the concept that the drug can reverse latency in HIV patients, but whether anti-PD1 also boosts the immune system enough to then attack and destroy HIV will form the next part of her work. “Can you enhance the immune system effect further by putting anti-PD1 with other agents [drugs] to even get a bigger effect? And then the most important thing to examine now is, how can you dose anti-PD1 safely in people with HIV but who don’t have cancer?” Lewin said. “That’s a study that we are about to embark on.” Stuart Turville, an associate professor and virologist with the Kirby Institute’s immunovirology and pathogenesis program at the University of NSW, said Lewin’s team was known for examining latency reversing agents – “basically, compounds that could wake the virus up”. “It is normal for our immune system to be resting,” he said, “ticking over until our body sees something that we need to respond to. HIV takes advantage of this. It enters cells that rest and in doing so sits there for years. “Importantly in this study of cancer patients with HIV, they observed the virus was woken up upon administration of the PD1 inhibitor by using cutting-edge molecular techniques developed to analyse the HIV reservoir at high sensitivity and at [a] granular level.” He believes the study shows there may be “potential for this and other similar treatments to develop a pathway towards a pragmatic HIV cure”. Lewin said while existing treatments for HIV were safe, effective, and led to good health, working towards a cure was still important because treatment was lifelong and not everyone had access to it. “Globally 70% of people have access to treatment, and lifelong access to antiretroviral treatment is not guaranteed for everyone and is a real challenge for the world,” she said. “There’s 1.8 million new HIV infections every year so that pool of people is only going to get bigger. That’s why we need a cure as well as treatment. “I think anti-PD1 will ultimately form part of a multi-pronged intervention. But I think it’s very unlikely a single drug or intervention is going to cure HIV.”",News/Society,"Drug used to treat cancer may also help fight HIV, Australian research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/drug-used-to-treat-cancer-may-also-help-fight-hiv-australian-research-finds
1/27/2022,"Australia’s defence minister has branded the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, an ageing dictator who is becoming “more and more irrational”. Peter Dutton also vowed to continue to speak out against China’s “belligerent approach” just hours after the new Chinese ambassador arrived in Australia with a conciliatory message about getting the troubled relationship “back to the right track”.  Dutton, a conservative former leadership contender who is becoming increasingly outspoken on foreign affairs, said on Thursday the international community must “put as much pressure on Russia as possible” to prevent a “devastating” invasion of Ukraine. “Now, whether or not they listen to that, ultimately, is a decision for Putin, and he sees no doubt that Ukraine is part of the Russia that he wants to bequeath to his successor at some point,” Dutton told Sydney radio station 2GB. “He’s 69 years of age, and these sort of dictators, who are getting older and want to leave their legacy, start to become more and more irrational.” Western countries have voiced increasing concern about Russia’s buildup of more than 100,000 troops near the Ukraine border but opinions differ on if, or when, Putin plans a full-scale military invasion. Russia has demanded security guarantees and a promise that Ukraine never be admitted to Nato, which the US has rejected. Ukrainian leaders have said they don’t believe an invasion is imminent and have called for calm. Dutton said there were “worrying signs” regarding Russia’s intentions with “the movement of troops and the considerable buildup … of concern to every observer”. He said an invasion of Ukraine “would be devastating because it would disrupt world economic markets” and have an effect on energy security in Europe. “But more importantly than any of that is that you’d see tens of thousands of people die.” Britain and other Nato allies are currently considering a request from the US to deploy hundreds more troops to support member countries in eastern Europe. The Australian government says it is not planning to send troops or military assets to the region in the event of a conflict, but it is considering supplying extra liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe. Those talks were launched after the US and the UK raised fears the continent’s reliance on Russian gas makes it vulnerable in the growing standoff with Putin. Dutton said recent cyber-attacks against Ukraine could be viewed as “the first step in trying to knock out some of their systems and compromise some of their capability to respond to Russian incursion”. He said he hoped for “an 11th hour reprieve”. In broader remarks, Dutton called on China to “be a good neighbour” and said Australia wanted “to be a good neighbour to them” – but indicated the government was not about to tone down its commentary about Australia’s biggest trading partner. China’s new ambassador, Xiao Qian, who landed in Australia on Wednesday after years of increasing tensions between the two countries, said the relationship was “at a critical juncture” and faced “many difficulties and challenges”. Xiao, the former Chinese ambassador to Indonesia, was relatively upbeat in his first comments in Sydney, saying the relationship also had “enormous opportunities and potential” and he saw his new diplomatic role “as a noble mission”. In a statement distributed by the Chinese embassy, Xiao said the relationship would improve “as long as both sides adhere to the principles of mutual respect, equality, inclusiveness and mutual learning”. “I look forward to working with the Australian government and friends in all sectors to increase engagement and communication, enhance mutual understanding and trust, eliminate misunderstanding and suspicion, promote mutually beneficial exchanges and cooperation in all areas between the two sides, and jointly push the China-Australia relations back to the right track.” Dutton said the Australian government welcomed the new ambassador and still wanted “a good, strong, friendly relationship with China”. But he said China was “in conflict” or “at loggerheads” with Australia and “many, many other countries”. “It’s a belligerent approach, and it’s unacceptable,” Dutton said. Dutton said Australia would continue to talk about human rights issues, including the case of tennis star Peng Shuai, who in November alleged that a senior Chinese official had sexually assaulted her in the past. Dutton – who said in 2019 that some women detained by Australia on Nauru had been “trying it on” in claiming they were raped and needed an abortion – implied that Peng was subsequently pressured to retract the allegations. “We haven’t heard from her except for, you know, the rehearsed, sort of trotted-out lines,” Dutton said. “These are issues that the world needs to speak about, and if we remain silent, we remain weak, we block our ears and pretend it’s going to go away, the problem will only just compound.” Australia and China have been increasingly at odds over the past few years, with the Australian government raising concerns about human rights in Xinjiang, the crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong, Beijing’s ratcheting up of military pressure against Taiwan, and its disputed claims in the South China Sea. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Beijing has objected to Australia’s laws against foreign interference that were seen as targeting China and the ban on Chinese telco Huawei from the 5G network. Beijing rolled out trade actions against Australian export sectors, including barley, red wine and coal, and froze high-level talks in 2020 – moves the Australian government branded as “economic coercion”. The Chinese embassy’s release of a document, later branded a “list of grievances” against Australia, also triggered a diplomatic storm. Xiao’s predecessor as ambassador, Cheng Jingye, warned in April 2021 that Beijing would respond “in kind” if Australia imposed sanctions against Chinese officials over human rights. In November the acting ambassador, Wang Xining, likened Australia to “a naughty guy” over the Aukus nuclear-powered submarine deal.",News/Australia news,Peter Dutton labels Vladimir Putin an ageing dictator who is becoming ‘more irrational’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/27/peter-dutton-labels-vladimir-putin-an-ageing-dictator-who-is-becoming-more-irrational
