4/26/2022,"It must be difficult to cast Funny Girl. Whoever anchors the musical stands in the shadow of two stage titans: Fanny Brice, the vaudeville star whose life provides the (loose) basis for a show that’s basically the early 20th century version of A Star is Born, and Barbra Streisand, who originated the role as a relatively unknown 21-year-old in 1964 and blended a story of singular talent and inevitable fame seamlessly with her own. (Streisand also won the best actress Oscar for the 1968 film adaptation.) For the show’s first Broadway revival, producers have handed the reins to Beanie Feldstein, a Broadway sophomore (she made her debut in 2017 as Minnie Fay in Hello, Dolly!) primarily known for her sharp screen work in Booksmart, Lady Bird and as Monica Lewinsky in Impeachment: American Crime Story. The casting makes sense on paper; Feldstein brings an endearing everygirl to Fanny. Her crisp comedic timing adapts well to the show’s slapstick gags and Fanny’s avant-klutz schtick; her deep brown eyes, wide as saucers, effectively project a real human on and off the meta-stage. Whether in diva mode or an anxious, awkward frenzy, Feldstein mostly hangs on to a torpedo of a character. But this is a musical, one with some full-tilt belting, and her singing just isn’t up to par. Paper-thin, reedy in the higher registers and overly nasal throughout, Feldstein’s voice is noticeably untextured compared to the rest of the cast. The role that gave Streisand some of her staples — People and Don’t Rain on My Parade, Funny Girl’s showstopper that Feldstein visibly musters every ounce of strength to blare – requires a power singer. Feldstein simply isn’t one. Which is a serious problem when a show hinges on the story of one woman’s undeniable talent for the stage, let alone in a role pioneered by one of the most renowned singers of the last half century; the rest of the production, directed by Michael Mayer and choreographed by Ellenore Scott, seems to be hustling to compensate for this lack. That’s accomplished mostly by tap virtuoso Jared Grimes as Fanny’s dance director Eddie Ryan, a superb Ramin Karimloo as Fanny’s suave yet feeble-minded husband Nick Arnstein, and an always entertaining Jane Lynch as her straight-shooting, salon-owning mother. (Unfortunately for Feldstein, the Glee star’s casting serves as a reminder that Lea Michele, who publicly semi-gunned for the role for over a decade, can nail Don’t Rain on My Parade.) The show, with original music by Jule Styne and lyrics by Bob Merrill from the book by Isobel Lennart, opens at Manhattan’s New Amsterdam Theater in the early 20s; Brooklyn-bred Fanny, now years into vaudeville stardom with a company called the Ziegfield Follies, has returned to the theater on the night of her husband’s release from prison for embezzlement. The anticipation triggers a flood of memories, which play as an extended flashback until late in the second act: Fanny’s start as a clumsy chorus girl desperate for stardom, honing her persona as a self-consciously unpretty comedienne, meeting the debonair gambler Nick Arnstein, supporting his dubious endeavors with her own money. Harvey Fierstein’s revised book switches some numbers around – Mrs Brice and Eddie’s Who Taught Her Everything She Knows?, a highlight of the evening, is effectively moved to the second act – and cuts down on the second half to primarily focus on Nick’s feckless swanning and swirling of the drain. (The show runs nearly three hours, including a 15-minute intermission.) The arrangement works, especially as it provides a showcase for Karimloo’s Nick, at once a lout, a charmer, a sympathetic poker player down on his luck, a devoted husband, and a pitiable figure. Feldstein, generally good as a precocious young woman, seems befuddled by the evolution into romance and marriage, leaving Karimloo to carry later scenes near single-handedly. In the slapstick dining room seduction number You Are Woman, I Am Man, for instance, Karimloo jumps from the floor to the chaise while keeping his body horizontal, as if snapped by a rubber band; Feldstein, meanwhile, keeps up the game with a too-piercing cackle. Ironically, a show about one woman’s spectacle, fame, and ineffable charm was strongest in its most populous moments – the Follies chorus, with elaborate, stunning costumes by Susan Hilferty (from diaphanous butterflies to gold-flecked soliders). The rowdy tavern number Henry Street, featuring an excellent Toni DiBuono as nosy neighbor Mrs Strakosh. The spin of the set by David Zinn, which manages to convey action from Brooklyn to Manhattan stages to a Cleveland train station in a rotating, center stage that occasionally resembled a brick turret. Grimes deserves another mention for his tap dancing, choreographed by Ayodele Casel, which was simply mesmerizing. The full glitz provided to His Love Makes Me Beautiful, in which Fanny improvises her debut for the Follies, was a highlight both for the production and for Feldstein’s finesse of full-body physical comedy on stage. I felt for Feldstein, at times alone on stage singing numbers she just can’t fully carry. There are high points to this new Funny Girl – moments of comedy and genuine laughs. But this is Broadway; the bar is higher than that. Funniness alone didn’t make Fanny Brice, the musical character, a star.",Arts/Stage,Funny Girl review – Beanie Feldstein struggles in Broadway revival,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/25/funny-girl-review-beanie-feldstein-struggles-broadway-revival
4/26/2022,"A man arrested by police investigating the disappearance of a 33-year-old woman in Burnley is said to be known to her. Detectives have been given 36 more hours to question a 50-year-old man, from Burnley, on suspicion of kidnap. In a statement on Monday, Lancashire constabulary said the man was known to Katie Kenyon, who has not been seen since Friday morning. Kenyon was seen leaving an address in Todmorden Road, Burnley. At about 9.30am, a woman matching her description was witnessed leaving with a man and travelling in a silver Ford Transit to the Bolton-by-Bowland area of north Lancashire. The 33-year-old from Padiham, near Burnley, has not been seen since. Family members said her disappearance was out of character. Police have brought in mountain rescue teams and firefighters to help search the rural area. She is described as white, 5ft 9in, with shoulder-length blond hair. She was last seen wearing a blue cardigan, a light blue and white top, and black leggings. Police issued a photograph of the silver Transit van as they appealed for anyone who saw the vehicle, or has dashcam footage of it, to come forward. DCI Al Davies, of Lancashire constabulary’s major investigation team, said: “We continue to be extremely concerned about Katie and we have a large team who are working hard to try and find out what has happened to her. “I am keeping an open mind about what has happened to her but my concern obviously grows as time goes by. “I would appeal again for anyone who was in the Bolton-by-Bowland area on Friday and saw anything suspicious to get in touch, especially if they saw the silver van or Katie alone or in company. “Please do come and speak to us even if you think the information you have may not be important.”",News/UK news,Man held on suspicion of kidnap after Burnley woman goes missing,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/man-arrested-on-suspicion-of-kidnap-after-burnley-woman-katie-kenyon-goes-missing
4/26/2022,"What’s gone wrong at the Home Office (‘Inhumane’ Homes for Ukraine scheme requests security scans for baby girl, 24 April)? On 22 February, we submitted an application for a visa for my wife’s 15-year-old daughter, Lisa, to come to the UK from Ukraine as the child of a parent settled in the UK. Two days later, Russian forces invaded Ukraine. On 26 February, we arranged for Lisa to travel on her own to Warsaw, where my wife, Zoriana, flew out to meet her. They submitted her biometrics in Warsaw on 28 February, and later that week I managed to get her case escalated as urgent. Since then we’ve been advised that we should abandon our application and apply for a visa under the new Ukraine family scheme. However, the advice on the long-term implications differs depending on who you talk to. We did get an email four weeks ago asking us to pay the immigration health surcharge and to check our junk mailbox for a link to pay this. If we didn’t receive the link (we didn’t), we were to let them know by sending a message to the “document upload” email address and they would “urgently” resend it. We immediately did this, and have repeated this three times, each time receiving confirmation of receipt. Since then we have heard nothing, and we fear that our application has disappeared into a black hole. All the phone lines steer you through hundreds of options, all ending with a voice message. We cannot speak to anyone. I decided to send a complaint using the online form. This is where frustration turned into despair; after filling in all the relevant details including the applicant’s name, passport number and date of birth – a message came up: “Applicants must be over 18 to complain.”Lee KnellerLondon  We are hoping to sponsor a Ukrainian family, but we have become tied up in needless bureaucracy. The family – a mother and two boys aged three and 10 – are still in Ukraine. They had a sponsor and received their visas weeks ago, but unfortunately the original sponsor had to pull out. We stepped in as new sponsors. After many attempts, we managed to speak to the immigration helpline and were informed that the family would need to apply for new visas to reflect the new sponsor. We are doing everything we can to help this family. They are stuck in Ukraine, even though they have visas. Surely it should be simple to get our police and home checks done and simply update the visa data to reflect the change of sponsor? We have applied for new visas, but the system is not at all transparent and we are fully expecting something to go wrong, as they will be confused by this second visa application.

There are individual men and women and there are families”, Margaret Thatcher, 1987). Since this is demonstrably nonsense, for such players to compete would send a message to Russian viewers that their country has incurred only limited opprobrium for invading another sovereign state, killing tens of thousands of people and reducing cities such as Mariupol to uninhabitable ruins, and that those are less important than hitting a ball over a net.Christopher ClaytonChristleton, Cheshire  Opponents of the ban on Russian tennis players at Wimbledon make much of the rights of the players as private individuals.

4/26/2022,"Ten children in the UK have required a liver transplant following a recent surge in severe hepatitis cases among young children, with the current total standing at 114 cases across all four UK nations. A lack of exposure to common adenoviruses due to Covid restrictions during the past two years combined with a recent spike in adenovirus infection as society opens back up is the most likely explanation, experts say. Adenoviruses are common viruses that can cause a range of symptoms, from common cold-like symptoms, to fever, pneumonia, diarrhoea and conjunctivitis. They do not usually cause hepatitis, although this can be a very rare complication of some types of adenovirus infection. Speaking during an emergency session at the European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in Lisbon on Monday, Dr Meera Chand, incident director for UKHSA’s investigation into the hepatitis surge, said that of 81 cases reported in England so far, 43 children had fully recovered, while 38 were still in hospital. Seven of the transplant cases were in England. “The cases in England are not known to be connected to each another and are dispersed all over the country,” she said. The vast majority of cases have involved children aged one to six (median age: three), and have occurred during the past three to five weeks. None of the affected children have died. A leading hypothesis is that surge in severe hepatitis is a knock-on effect of the pandemic, with lockdowns and other restrictions having meant that many children have had less exposure to common viruses than normal, resulting in an inadequate immune response when confronted with infection as society opens back up. Adenoviruses are a prime suspect: they are spread through close personal contact, coughing or sneezing, and touching contaminated surfaces. Of the 53 children with hepatitis in England who have been tested for adenovirus so far, 40 (75%) tested positive. Adenovirus infections among one- to four-year-olds in England are also currently at their highest level compared with any other time during the past five years, Chand said. “I think our leading hypothesis, given the data that we’ve seen, is that we probably have a normal adenovirus circulating, but we have a co-factor affecting a particular age group of young children which is either rendering that infection more severe, or causing it to trigger some kind of [inappropriate immune response],” said Chand. Prof Deirdre Kelly, a paediatric hepatologist at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS trust and part of a group working with UKHSA to investigate the cases, said: “It may be due to the fact that children who have been largely isolated are responding to viruses that they would normally have built up an immunity to at an early age or it could be previous infection with Covid that has affected the body’s defence systems.” Between January and April 2018, the Birmingham centre, which is the largest of three specialist centres in the UK that treat severe liver disease in children, saw six severe unexplained hepatitis cases in children. “In the same time interval this year we saw about 40,” Kelly said. “We don’t have the answer why but it’s likely to be something to do with the pandemic because we never had this before.” Another possibility is that recent Covid infection could suppress the immune system, making children more vulnerable to serious side-effects from normally fairly innocuous viruses; or that a new, more virulent strain of adenovirus is in circulation, although initial genotyping has found no evidence for this, Kelly said. Most of the infections appear to involve adenovirus 41F, which usually causes diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain and fever. Cases of severe hepatitis among young children have also been detected in 12 other countries, with at least 169 cases reported to the World Health Organization so far. Most of the reported cases have been in the UK, followed by Spain (13 cases) and Israel (12 cases). Cases have also been reported in the US, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Norway, Romania and Belgium.",News/Society,Ten UK children require transplant amid surge in hepatitis cases,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/ten-uk-children-require-transplant-amid-surge-in-hepatitis-cases
4/26/2022,"That the NHS has diverted so much inpatient care into the private sector is a disgrace (NHS paying £2bn a year to private hospitals for mental health patients, 24 April). When I became an NHS consultant psychiatrist in 1992, I had 70 inpatients under my care; when I retired in 2017, I had seven. I took early retirement partly because a psychiatric crisis service without enough beds is dangerous: it is like a surgeon being asked to operate without instruments. Many clinicians working in mental health are wasting time looking for non-existent NHS beds instead of treating patients. Once in a private sector bed, patients with common treatable mental health problems stay there, as private hospitals lack the multidisciplinary skills that get people better. Also, private hospitals have the perverse incentive that they do not get paid if they discharge patients. Private sector “care” is a false economy – another example of failed Tory privatisation.Jeremy SeymourSheffield  I endorse the views of the NHS psychiatrist who said that private mental health hospitals have no incentive to discharge patients (‘Woeful scarcity’: NHS psychiatrist decries lack of mental health beds, 24 April). As a member of a health authority patient review team, I found that they often resisted appeals to discharge patients until Mental Health Act tribunals said that they were fit for “release”.

4/26/2022,"Global stock markets fell sharply on Monday as fears of new lockdowns in China added to concerns over the health of the world economy. China’s benchmark share index posted its biggest one-day tumble since February 2020, after Beijing’s biggest district began mass testing for Covid-19 because of a rise in infections in the capital. The CSI 300 index fell by 4.9% to hit its lowest level since late May 2020, as authorities ordered that residents in Chaoyang, home to 3.45 million people, should be tested three times this week. Raw materials producers, technology companies and industrial groups were among the major fallers. Fears that restrictions will be imposed in Beijing also prompted panic buying at supermarkets, as residents braced for curbs similar to those implemented in Shanghai, where a lockdown has entered its fourth week. On Sunday, a municipality official warned that Beijing’s outbreak was “spreading stealthily” from unknown sources, and “developing rapidly”. Concerns that China could impose further lockdowns, slowing its recovery, hit markets across the region, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng shedding 3.7% and Australia’s S&P/ASX index off 1.5%. In London, the FTSE 100 index dropped by 141 points, or 1.9%, to 7380.5 points, its lowest close in more than five weeks. Mining stocks and energy firms led the fallers, as new curbs in China could hit demand for metals, coal and oil. Anglo American lost 6.85%, BP fell 6.2% and Glencore dropped 5.6%. Stocks fell across Europe, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 index losing 1.8% despite relief that Emmanuel Macron had won Sunday’s French presidential election. Wall Street added to Friday’s losses, with the S&P 500 down 1% by midday. The yield, or interest rate, on UK, US and eurozone government bonds fell, a sign that investors were seeking a safe-haven asset and anticipating slower growth. “More than two years into the pandemic and Covid is still roiling financial markets,” said Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at City Index and Forex.com. “Concerns about demand have intensified after Beijing locked down parts of Chaoyang district as the virus spread there. This triggered panic as people had hoped that lockdowns would ease in Shanghai rather than more restrictions being imposed elsewhere. But now the prospects of the capital city being put into a full lockdown has unnerved investors worldwide.” Economists warned that China’s efforts to stick to its zero-Covid strategy could mean further lockdowns, disrupting global supply chains over the coming months, and adding to inflation. “Without a major overhaul of quarantine rules, the economic damage due to Omicron will likely increase,” predicted Frédérique Carrier, the head of investment strategy in Britain and Asia at RBC Wealth Management. “Premier Li Keqiang has repeatedly warned of growth risks this month, and the State Council and related government departments have ordered local authorities to minimise transportation and logistics disruptions when imposing local quarantines. “Domestic logistics and port operations disruptions may spill over to regional or global supply chains. In addition, some cities under lockdown in southern and eastern China are manufacturing hubs for electronic products, chips, and electric vehicles. Exports are likely to slow more meaningfully in the coming months.” Benchmark China iron ore futures dropped almost 11% to the lowest in more than a month, on concerns that demand from the steel industry could weaken. Palladium, used in car catalytic converters, slumped more than 10%. Oil prices tumbled more than 6%, with Brent crude dropping below $100 ($78.60) a barrel for the first time in almost two weeks. “The world’s biggest crude importer is heading for the worst oil demand shock since early 2020,” said Ole Hansen, the head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “Supply worries have not suddenly disappeared, with Libyan supply disruptions as well as sanctions and a potential widening ban against Russian crude oil import also lingering. For now, however, the market is in risk-off mode.” Fears that the US central bank will aggressively raise interest rates this year also hit markets, after signals from several Federal Reserve officials that they will tighten policy to pull down inflation. The pound dropped 1% to an 18-month low against the US dollar, dipping more than a cent to $1.271.",News/Business,Global stocks fall amid fears of new Covid lockdowns in China,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/global-stocks-fall-amid-fears-of-new-covid-lockdowns-in-china
4/26/2022,"The British public has “run out of patience” with English football’s failure to reform itself, the sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, has said, as he confirmed legislation for an independent regulator would be in place before the next general election. The government has endorsed 10 key principles in Tracey Crouch’s fan-led review into football governance, with a new regulator the central idea among them. Huddleston said government also expects the Premier League to distribute more money across the football pyramid and for a solution to be agreed with the Football League before the summer. “We’ve all got incredibly frustrated over years, in fact decades, of football recognising it’s got problems and singularly failing to sort them out,” Huddleston said. “Quite frankly I think the British public and football fans in particular have run out of patience, and there is a need to intervene.” While responses to the government’s decision to support the Crouch review were largely positive, some, including Crouch herself, said the lack of a timeline for delivery of new legislation was “worrying”. Huddleston insisted the government had committed to bringing a regulator into law before the next election, which is currently scheduled for 2024. “There are some people expecting this is going to happen tomorrow or next week and there are other people thinking it’s two years but we do have the commitment to get this done before the next election,” he said. “We want to move forward quickly because we know there’s overwhelming demand for this and we know the problems in football. But if we implemented it tomorrow we could have exactly the opposite impact of what we are intending: making sure that clubs can survive and that they are financially sustainable.” Huddleston said that details on the regulator’s powers would be published this summer as part of a white paper, including possible measures to ensure greater financial redistribution within the English game. In its response to the fan-led review the government said that such a settlement should be agreed within football, ie between the Premier League and EFL directly, but it later confirmed that such an outcome needs to be confirmed by the summer. “I think the message to the Premier League is quite clear,” Huddleston said, “they need to act sooner rather than later because, otherwise, it will be forced on them through the regulator.” The sports minister said he encouraged football to take pro-active measures on other recommendations from the report, such as creating better representation for supporters and ensuring the preservation of assets of ‘cultural heritage’ like football stadiums, so as to avoid the possibility of those solutions being imposed by government too. Huddleston said that there were those within his own party who are “very uncomfortable with this level of intervention we’re proposing”, but the Conservative government now looks to have committed itself fully to independent regulation of one of the country’s greatest culture exports.

4/26/2022,"Almost 1,000 Ukrainian families who applied for visas under the UK government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme are still waiting for the applications to be processed more than a month after submitting them. One would-be host, Lauren Corbishley, who has founded a protest group about the delays, said the failure to issue visas to some of those who applied at the beginning of the scheme was “torture” for the families. She called on the government to launch a public inquiry into what has gone wrong. A group of would-be hosts protested outside parliament on Monday and met MPs including Theresa May and Steve Baker. They presented the MPs with a dossier of 986 cases where visas have been applied for but not yet granted. Of these, 866 applied in the first two weeks of the scheme, which opened on 18 March. The government did not respond to claims from UK hosts and Ukrainian families that visa applications submitted early on in the scheme had gone astray, pointing out instead that the Home Office was now processing thousands of cases a day. Two of the protesters at parliament, Debbie and Trevor Farnfield, helped the family they hope to sponsor apply for visas on 24 March. The family fled from Ukraine to Poland and are sleeping on mattresses in a gym outside Warsaw. The parents and two children have been granted visas but a third sibling has not, which means the whole family have been unable to travel to the UK. The Farnfields held up photos of the family at the Westminster protest. “We wanted to help Ukrainian refugees because we have a family-size home but no longer have all of our family living in it,” Debbie Farnfield said. “We could not live with our consciences if we didn’t help out.” They and the family they want to support are frustrated by the delays. “The visa system has become a national embarrassment,” said Trevor Farnfield. Jo Wright, a wheelchair user, is trying to host a Ukrainian Paralympic athlete, Svitlana Tryfonova, and her two children. Wright has an accessible home and wanted a Ukrainian with a disability to be able to benefit from it. “The family have been living in a three-storey building with no lift, so Svitlana’s sons have been carrying her up and down the stairs,” Wright said. “We booked them on to a flight to the UK today but we’re still waiting for the visas so had to cancel the flight.” Visas for Tryfonova and her elder son have been processed but the family are still waiting for a visa for the younger son. A group called Vigil for Visas is calling on the government to simplify the visa process, allow applications to be tracked in real time and end the delays that they say could prove deadly for people trapped in a war zone. Corbishley’s group, Protest Over Missing Visa Applications 18-25 March 2022, is another highlighting the problems many are having with getting UK visas. A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to the generosity of the public who have offered their homes to Ukrainians fleeing the war and through the Ukraine family scheme, more than 71,800 visas have been granted with 21,600 Ukrainians arriving safely in the UK. The Home Office is now processing thousands of visas a day – this shows the changes made to streamline the service are working and we’ll continue to build on this success so we can speed up the process even further.”",News/UK news,Homes for Ukraine hosts protest over Home Office visa delays,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/homes-for-ukraine-hosts-protest-over-home-office-visa-delays
4/26/2022,"Shortages of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) products in the UK have forced women to resort to the private sector, ration their doses and procure supplies from abroad. Although the last five years have seen the number of prescriptions double in England, shortages of HRT products have been a problem for several years, with shortfalls blamed on manufacturing and supply issues. Four women describe the lengths they’ve had to go to to access their medication. In one week at the beginning of April, Kerri Sharp said she visited 12 pharmacies across London to try to fill her HRT prescription, with no luck. “What’s frustrating is no one could say when they were expecting to get a new batch in. If you know there will be some coming in, it takes the stress away.” The 61-year-old freelance book editor said several pharmacists told her she was one of 20 to 50 women they had seen who had been prescribed Oestrogel but were unable to get it. Sharp said one customer she met “shrugged her shoulders, saying: “Good luck – I’ve been everywhere.” Instead, Sharp was forced to buy from an online pharmacy, at the cost of £42 for one month’s supply. She said she tried at least five other online pharmacies before finding one with Oestrogel in stock, and even then, the retailer was rationing it to one pack per order. “It’s the route I’ve been able to find by absolute tenacity and research – I’ve not managed it through the usual established channels.” It was meant to be a one-off, but Sharp doesn’t feel hopeful about supply returning soon: “It’s looking a bit bleak so I might have to purchase again. I’ll be back to square one in a month’s time.” For some, sourcing their HRT medication has been an issue for years. Former marketing executive Annabel Bradbury said she has struggled to find Estradot patches since 2019. Instead, the 55-year-old has usually had to rely on her sister, who lives in Spain, to send over the product. “With a very significant level of effort, I’ve been able to get what I need,” she said. “I’ve occasionally found supply down in Devon where my father-in-law lives. I’m pretty resourceful and was able to ring around and hustle.” Bradbury’s local pharmacist in London said the demand for Estradot outstrips the supply he is given. “He said, ‘I’ve got one box per month and I’ve got 30 women asking for it’ – he was throwing his hands in the air exasperated,” she said, adding that he said he was “getting a lot of abuse”. But in the last couple of months, Bradbury’s sister has reported that supplies are drying up in Spain too. “She gets me whatever she can. She goes to a neighbouring pharmacy if one doesn’t have it, so she’ll have a circuit in her town and she’ll just try them all.” Chloe Taylor, a 45-year-old software engineer in North Yorkshire, has also found accessing HRT products hit-and-miss the last couple of years. Taylor, who is trans, has been on HRT for “a good 10 years”, and was initially on patches, before being switched on to a gel due to an allergy. But shortages have meant there have been times she has had to use them despite the patches giving her “itchy red welts”. Last month, Taylor was once again unable to get her prescription fulfilled. The 45-year-old usually deals with shortages by “rationing [her doses] down”. “Even then if I start to get symptoms, I take the full dose and try to play it by ear. Heavens knows what it does to my endocrine system.” She said she’s concerned about the long term. “I’m worried about the bigger picture – is this going to get worse? Because it certainly doesn’t seem to be getting any better.” When Elaine Kelly, a 45-year-old in Birmingham, tried to get her prescription for Oestrogel filled in February, she could not find any supply locally. “I used Boots’ online prescription checker where you can check the stock within a five mile radius – nothing anywhere,” said Kelly, who works in the public sector. She was not surprised – she had seen other women discussing the shortages in the Facebook groups she is a member of. Kelly, who also had to resort to getting her initial HRT recommendation elsewhere, ended up having to fill her Oestrogel prescription at a private pharmacy. For three months’ supply, she has spent upwards of £250 on consultations, blood tests and prescriptions. “Long-term. it’s a cost implication,” she said, explaining that some of the costs have gone on her credit card. “It’s a potential debt issue for those for whom the costs of private care are prohibitive. Not being on HRT isn’t an option; I had to have a substantial amount of time off work before it. “Everyone I know on HRT has had to fight for it or be forced to pay for private treatment. It’s unacceptable.”",News/Society,‘It’s looking bleak’: how HRT shortages have affected women in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/25/hormone-replacement-therapy-hrt-shortage-women-in-england
4/26/2022,"Although he wrote several popular television sitcom series in the 1980s, Eric Chappell, who has died aged 88, was best known for his first success, Rising Damp (1974-78), produced at Yorkshire Television and starring Leonard Rossiter as the overweening, lecherous landlord Rupert Rigsby and Frances de la Tour as one of his lodgers, Ruth Jones, in a northern university town. Also in the cast, Richard Beckinsale, as the long-haired, borderline angelic medical student Alan Moore, and Don Warrington, as the cool and composed Philip Smith (son, he said, of an African prince), brought a further depth to the comic acting. Its quality was a result not just of Chappell’s excellent scripts – he had a gift for writing dialogue in extended comic scenes – but also the theatrical origins of the series. Chappell, who had worked as an auditor for the East Midlands Electricity Board for 22 years, was an unpublished novelist who decided to try his luck in the theatre, because a play meant writing 20,000 words, as opposed to the 70,000-word minimum for a novel. On a whim, he sent his play, The Banana Box, to an agent at Curtis Brown because he had read, and admired, the plays of RC Sherriff (author of the first world war hit Journey’s End), who was a client of that agency. There was a reading of the play, then a premiere at the Phoenix theatre in Leicester in 1971, with Wilfrid Brambell (the senior, salivating rag-and-bone man in Steptoe and Son) in the landlord role, followed by an Oxford Playhouse touring production by David Scase. This version landed at the Hampstead Theatre Club in London in May 1973 – the text was published in Plays and Players magazine – with Rossiter, De la Tour (replacing Rosemary Leach, who had played Miss Jones), Warrington and Paul Jones – then prominent as a blues singer with Manfred Mann – as the medical student. It then transferred to the Apollo theatre for a six-week run as the television pilot was commissioned and Beckinsale replaced Jones. The BBC had allegedly declined to take up an option because Chappell’s script contained “too many jokes”. The landlord as played by Brambell had been called Rooksby, but a real-life landlord of that name objected to being represented on stage by such a scrofulous toe-rag and the name was changed to Rigsby. It was undoubtedly Rossiter’s turbo-charged, manic and physically extraordinary performance that propelled the huge success of the TV series, and indeed its continuing popularity. Joe McGrath’s 1980 film, with Christopher Strauli replacing Beckinsale, who had died tragically young in 1979, was a severe disappointment, but Rising Damp lives on in those endless repeats. Chappell became a full-time writer and embarked on a prolific career. He was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire, the son of a printing plant worker, and educated at Grantham boys’ central school. Another TV sitcom he had written, The Squirrels, aired at almost the same time as Rising Damp. This was set in the accounts department of a television rental company and starred Bernard Hepton as a boss who, like Rigsby, but less alarmingly, sees himself as something of a ladies’ man. Most of Chappell’s writing played on ideas of class distinction, snobbery and delusions of grandeur, separated partners and adultery, and social and emotional crises. Always working on a trusty Olympia typewriter, he wrote most of his TV sitcoms as dramatic pieces for the theatre, sometimes adapting a play – he wrote two dozen in all – and occasionally returning a sitcom to its theatrical origin. None of these plays achieved any success comparable to that of The Banana Box. Father’s Day (2011) for instance, was a poor spin-off from the hit series Home to Roost (1985-90) starring John Thaw as an irascible divorcee who has his comfortable bachelor-pad existence invaded by a teenage, semi-delinquent son (Reece Dinsdale), who turns out to be a chip off the old block. Wife After Death – in which a husband’s double life comes to light at his funeral – was last heard of touring with Tom Conti in 2010, although it does, like many of Chappell’s plays, remain a staple of the amateur repertoire. This recognition at least satisfied his hunger for appreciation in the live theatre, which he loved. Chappell’s other sitcom series included two collaborations with Peter Bowles (who had played a lascivious thespian in a memorable Rising Damp episode): Only When I Laugh (1979-82), in which Bowles was one of three class-differentiated patients in a hospital ward (the others played by Strauli and James Bolam), supervised by Richard Wilson as a grumpy – what else? – surgeon; and The Bounder (1982-83), in which Bowles struck up a superb double-act with George Cole as, respectively, an ex-convict living with his streetwise brother-in-law. There were highlights, too, in Duty Free (1984-86), with two British couples intermingling adulterously on holiday in Marbella (Keith Barron and Joanna Van Gyseghem crossing a class barrier in illicit lust); and in Singles (1988-91), both co-written with Jean Warr, with Roger Rees, Judy Loe (Beckinsale’s widow) and, replacing Rees in the third series, Simon Cadell, in a maelstrom of a singles bar where the regulars jockey for social and sexual supremacy. Chappell married Muriel Taylor, who worked for Oxfam, in 1959. They had two children, Richard and Paula, both teachers. All three survive him. He never moved far from his roots, living in the village of Barrowby, two miles outside Grantham, smoking his pipe, playing golf and tennis and quietly contemplating the folly of most human endeavour and behaviour, a good deal of which he skewered for the delight of millions of viewers in his popular, perceptive writing.

4/26/2022,"A tiny book, smaller than a playing card and containing 10 tantalisingly unpublished poems, is returning home to the West Yorkshire parsonage where it was lovingly written in 1829 by the 13-year-old Charlotte Brontë. Thought lost, it was bought in New York for $1.25m (£1m) with Haworth in mind and given it measures just 10cm by 6cm it is probably the most valuable literary manuscript ever sold. Its artistic value is also through the roof. “It is phenomenal really,” said Ann Dinsdale, principal curator of the Brontë Parsonage Museum. “I can’t quite believe it. I haven’t been able to take it all in yet.” The manuscript is one of the “little books” written when Charlotte and her siblings Emily, Anne and Branwell were children. Often written for Branwell’s toy soldiers, the manuscripts shine light on just how creative and astoundingly talented the four of them were. Titled “A Book of Ryhmes [sic] by Charlotte Brontë, Sold by Nobody and Printed by Herself” it is a collection of 10 poems she wrote aged 13. “She’s known for her novels but initially Charlotte wanted to be a poet,” said Dinsdale. “We know that she sent samples of her poetry to the poet laureate and she told him of her ambition to be a poet, which is quite something.” The poet laureate was Robert Southey who shamefully advised her against a literary career. “Literature cannot be the business of a woman’s life: and it ought not to be,” he wrote. The titles of the poems have been known to experts and are a long way from an isolated parsonage and the windswept moors of Yorkshire. They include On Seeing the Ruins of the Tower of Babel, Songs of an Exile and Meditations While Journeying in a Canadian Forest. Astonishingly, the poems themselves have never been published, photographed, transcribed or even summarised. A Book of Ryhmes is the last of more than two dozen miniature books created by Charlotte to remain in private hands. It was last seen at auction in New York in 1916 where it was sold for $520. It then disappeared with its whereabouts, or survival, unknown until now. When it emerged that the book would be a star of last weekend’s New York International Antiquarian book fair, the UK’s leading literary heritage charity sprang into action. The Friends of the National Libraries (FNL) was founded in 1931 to help save the UK’s written and printed history. One of its biggest successes was last year raising £15m to save the Honresfield Library, an unprecedented treasure trove of literary heritage and wonders that includes a letter in which Jane Austen anticipates the end of a love affair. Geordie Greig, the chair of FNL, said they had only two weeks to raise the money to buy the book, which had been a daunting task. “Saving Charlotte Brontë’s little book is a giant gain for Britain,” he said. “To return this literary treasure to the Brontë Parsonage where it was written is important for scholars and also students studying one of our greatest women writers.” Among the benefactors giving money to buy the book are the estate of TS Eliot and the Garfield Weston Foundation. The manuscript is being donated to the Brontë Society whose museum in Haworth has the largest collection of Brontë manuscripts in the world. It already has nine little books, soon to be joined by seven more from the Honresfield Library. Dinsdale said it was likely all four Brontës made little books or magazines when they were children, although none survive by Anne or Emily. The four siblings created a sophisticated imaginary world with a nation called Angria and a city called Glasstown, filled with their childhood heroes. From there came some of the greatest of all novels, none more so than Charlotte’s Jane Eyre and Emily’s Wuthering Heights. Dinsdale said it was absolutely thrilling to be the recipients of such an “extraordinary and unexpected” donation. “It is always emotional when an item belonging to the Brontë family is returned home and this final little book coming back to the place it was written when it had been thought lost is very special for us.”",Arts/Books,Charlotte Brontë’s $1.25m ‘little book’ of 10 poems returns home,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/25/charlotte-brontes-125m-little-book-of-10-poems-returns-home
4/26/2022,"Drug gangs are finding it increasingly difficult to get guns to terrorise rivals and their own members as London approaches six months without anyone being shot dead, Scotland Yard has said. Metropolitan police chiefs are trying to work out what has led to the fall in gun deaths and gun attacks in the capital. Not since 31 October 2021 has anyone been killed in a shooting on the streets of London. Fifteen people were shot dead in London in 2018, one fewer the year after, and 12 in 2021. The perception that London’s streets are a wild west of shootouts sits uneasily with the facts, according to the deputy assistant commissioner, Graham McNulty. He said a squeeze by police was making guns increasingly a weapon of last resort for drug gangs. “We are picking up that urban street gangs and organised crime groups in London are finding it difficult to source and move around firearms,” McNulty said. It is not just gun deaths that have plummeted. So far this year police have detected 27 shootings in the capital – barely one a week. In 2010-11 there were 499. “Gun crime in London is absolutely linked to gangs and drugs and the vast majority of victims and suspects are linked to that world,” McNulty said. Criminals use firearms to protect territory and markets, enforce debt collection, intimidate and frighten people, and as a status symbol. McNulty said: “They are struggling to get lethal weapons and so are having to convert weapons (such as antique weapons and starting pistols) to be lethal … and manufacture the ammunition themselves.” Long-term reforms to the way Britain’s biggest force tackles gun crime are bearing fruit. Intelligence that previously could sit around while other things were prioritised is instead promoted to the front of the queue and acted upon by special teams as part of Operation Viper, which began in 2016 under the former commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe. McNulty said there had been further improvements under Cressida Dick, who formally left the Met on Sunday after her resignation. A police squeeze on drug networks has benefited the fight against gun crime. Drug trafficking offences such as supply are up, from 2,281 convictions in 2019-20 to 3,720 in 2020-21. Where once drug supply suspects were having to be bailed for up to 100 days while forensics came back, now samples of suspected illegal narcotics can be tested within four hours and charges brought. McNulty said this thwarted opportunities for reprisal shootings of foot soldiers in the trade who lost their drugs to the police. “If you are arrested as a drug dealer or mule, they have lost a kilo of drugs and money and they have a problem. If you can arrest, charge and send them to prison, not only can they not deal drugs but the retribution cannot take place.” Police say intelligence from surveillance and human sources has improved and they are going after suspects for anything they lawfully can. Most illegal weapons in circulation are handguns, and imports include Brunis from Italy and Retays from Turkey. Gun crime offenders are mostly 18 to 24 years old and usually have past convictions for violence and drugs. McNulty said: “If you are in this world, you are a target. You may be an offender one day; the next you could be a victim.” Met chiefs are usually wary of talking publicly about their success on gun crime, partly because a sudden flurry of shootings could make them seem complacent. As one senior Met officer observed, police chiefs can be like politicians and claim credit where the news is good and blame extraneous factors when the news is bad.",News/UK news,No London shooting deaths in six months as police say gun trade stifled,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/no-london-shooting-deaths-in-six-months-as-police-stifle-gun-trade
4/26/2022,"Scientific experiments on crabs and lobsters could be curbed when the animal sentience bill becomes law, the Guardian has learned. There are few restrictions on how crustaceans and decapods can be treated in scientific studies, in contrast with mice and other mammals, for which there are strict welfare laws. Because scientists do not have to register how many crustaceans and decapods they experiment on, there are no numbers for how many are used. But because they breed quickly and are sensitive to pollutants, they are frequently used in experiments, especially those that look into how different types of pollution affect the body. But this could be about to change, Home Office sources said after crabs and lobsters were recognised as sentient beings who could feel pain. The new legislation, which is awaiting royal consent after being approved by parliament this month, means ministers must consider the sentience of animals when implementing policy. This could result in restrictions on how crabs and lobsters can be treated when experimented on. They are not included in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, unlike mice, octopuses and various other animals. This means that no licences or training are required before they can be used in procedures that can cause pain, suffering or distress. Robert Ellwood, professor emeritus at school of biological science Queen’s University Belfast, authored the research that found crabs and lobsters feel pain. He welcomed the potential legislative development, but said it must be applied to the commercial fishing industry as well as scientists. “This is a step forward and if people are happy to accept that decapods are sentient and experience pain, then they should be given some protection. But I would see this … as a problem if they still leave millions of animals in commercial practices that are treated the same as before,” said Ellwood, who has worked with crustaceans for 30 years. He added: “To ask scientists to go through all sorts of regulations that affect their work but allow these animals to be boiled alive at will would be unfair. “It is asking for more rules, regulations and red tape, it will take longer to conduct an experiment, but that is a good thing, if it is applied across the board.” Dr Penny Hawkins, the head of the animals in science department at the RSPCA, said: “It would be unthinkable to cause pain, suffering or distress to a mouse, rat or fish in a laboratory without proper regulation and ethical review. “We have always been assured that invertebrates, like decapods, would be added to the [legislation] if there was enough evidence that they were sentient. The evidence has been collected, and octopuses are already included – the time to regulate decapod use is now.” A government spokesperson said: “The UK is committed to the protection of animals in science and to ensuring animal research is only carried out where no practicable alternative exists. We are committed to maintaining robust regulatory standards and to investing in alternatives to animals. “The use of animals in research supports the development of new medicines and cutting-edge medical technologies, for humans and animals, as well as the safety and sustainability of our environment.”",News/World news,Crabs and lobsters may get similar rights in UK experiments as mammals,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/25/crabs--lobsters-may-get-similar-rights-uk-experiments-mammals-sentience-law-welfare
4/26/2022,"Wonders and marvels, the beautiful and the terrible, the celebratory and the morbid all fill the 59th Venice Biennale. Business as usual, you might say, but there are no trillionaire oligarch yachts moored by the Giardini and there is less razzmatazz all round. As well as being the first biennale since the pandemic, this is the first time the main exhibition has been predominantly devoted to women, trans and non-binary artists. It is also the first time that a black British artist, Sonia Boyce, has won the Golden Lion for best national pavilion. We wander about, wearing masks and carrying tote bags. The Russian pavilion is closed (the curators resigned) and Ukraine has a large presence both off-site and in the dusty spaces between the national pavilions. In the wake of Black Lives Matter, Covid and escalating existential dread, this biennale was bound to be different. You are asked to remain silent as you traipse through the Italian pavilion, which seems like a parody of a Mike Nelson installation. I heard the sound of frantic drilling emanating from behind the doors of the Chinese pavilion. You can’t read the white texts painted on to the white walls of the empty and partially excavated German pavilion. And if you don’t use the torch on your phone, you won’t see a thing in the Swiss pavilion, which presents itself as a concert for which there is currently no music. (The darkened space, populated by shadowy wooden heads, hands and other body parts, smells of charred wood – make of that what you will.) In Cecilia Alemani’s The Milk of Dreams, located towards the end of the Arsenale, a man sits on the edge of a bed in Diego Marcon’s film The Parent’s Room. A woman lies under the sheets beside him. A blackbird swoops on to the windowsill and sings, snow falls and the man sings too. He has murdered his wife, he tells us in verse, as well as his daughter and son. Dead or alive, the actors all wear prosthetic masks cast from their own faces. They appear not quite alive, not entirely dead either. The bird chirrups and the man sings sweetly of his crime, which culminates in his own suicide. What a strange, chilly little vignette this is; a cautionary tale; a revelling in melancholy and unaccountable murder on a winter’s day. That’s men for you, in their self-centred way. Marcon is one of only a handful of men in Alemani’s complex and fascinating show. The biennale’s main exhibition, The Milk of Dreams otherwise includes only women, non-binary and trans artists. One critic complained to me that he felt excluded. I barely noticed. Anyone needing a testosterone fix can head to other shows outside the biennale proper, which include large-scale representations of famous men including Anish Kapoor, Anselm Kiefer, Georg Baselitz and Markus Lupertz. As it is, cis-gendered white men have dominated the biennale for over a century. Gender alone does not drive The Milk of Dreams, whose title is borrowed from British surrealist Leonora Carrington, who imagined a world set free, where people transform themselves into someone or something else and identity becomes mutable. The imagination is the engine of change at a time when our place in the world – and indeed the world itself – feel ever more precarious. Carrington’s paintings occupy one of various thematic displays or time capsules within the exhibition by the New York-based Italian curator Alemani. These reflective pauses give The Milk of Dreams thematic and historical depth, punctuating what can too often feel like a procession of one damn thing after another. Along the way, we encounter mannequins and automata, puppets and masks, silent footage of Josephine Baker dancing at the Folies Bergère. In a section focusing on spiritualism, we find ectoplasm and concrete poetry, drawings that channel unseen forces and messages from the beyond. And then there are the jolts. Danish artist Louis Marcussen – who changed her name to Ovaracti, meaning Chief Lunatic – was assigned male at birth and attempted to change sex through self-surgery before being reassigned as a woman. Ovaracti’s elongated cutout figures, carved mannequins and paintings of cat-like figures (one smoking an opium pipe) are frightening, powerful, vulnerable and scary. And then to Nan Goldin’s film Sirens, a homage to black supermodel Donyale Luna, who died from heroin use in 1979. Using footage by Kenneth Anger, Fellini and Antonioni, Warhol screen tests, clips of the Manson family and a rave in London, Goldin takes us into a dangerous, languorous dream world, to a beautiful score by Mica Levi. Non-binary artist P Staff plunges us into a mirrored room bathed in nasty yellow light, where solarised, degraded and warped footage shows abattoir scenes including a live pig kicked along a corridor. Throughout, Alemani stops us flagging, although there are, as ever, longueurs and periods of trudge, with a certain overload of cyborgs and references to the post-human, as well as too many whimsical paintings. But The Milk of Dreams remains timely, picking up on shared preoccupations from pandemics to natural destruction. And, as much as Alemani’s biennale appears as a response to crisis, there is hope and humour here too. The part of the show that’s in the Giardini opens with Katharina Fritsch’s huge 1987 cast of an elephant, surrounded by its reflection in the mirrors on the walls. If there is always an elephant in the room, Fritsch’s is doubled and redoubled, multiplied endlessly as a phantom herd of the stoic and patient and wise. Fritsch’s hand-knitted minimal abstractions surround Romanian Andra Ursuţa’s translucent fused glass casts of body parts, bottles, junk, delicious sci-fi forms recalling movie monsters from Alien and Predator. Morphing bodies, the dumb, the beautiful and the fantastical recur. Animatronic robotic mechanisms and prosthetic body parts perform clumsy interactions with their maker. Tishan Hsu regards herself as a cyborg and her agglomerative works seem to morph the human body with the mobile phone – whose oversized screens bulge into body parts, grow nipples and curdle into navels. Gigantic figures stalk through green light. Dogs ravage an opulent house in Janis Rafa’s film Lacerate. They paw at sumptuous still lives, gnaw at dead birds and sniff at a man whose blood puddles on to the floor from a wound in his neck. Along the way, we pass huge heads, paper flowers, globular glass glands containing traces of melanin, testosterone and oestrogen. Sculptural machines ooze mysterious liquids. Things sag and leak and drizzle. Insect-like sculptures bulge with drooping silicon sacs. So many prone and abject figures, bits of bodies, limbs, wounds, bodies reduced to prone arrangements of tentacles or concrete jumpsuits. Marguerite Humeau’s abstract sculptures sweep and swoon and swerve in futuristic winds, performing an ecstatic dance, their forms made from metal, polyurethane, plastic ocean waste and algae. Little is what it seems. Over at the entrance to the Arsenale, we are greeted by Simone Leigh’s Brick House, a monumental bust of a black woman emerging from a sculpted domed cylinder reminiscent of an earthen dwelling from Chad or Cameroon. Part vessel, part building, it towers over us before we embark on the half-kilometre walk through a medieval rope factory. Another of Leigh’s sculptures appears in the garden, this time gilded in gold. Leigh’s sculptures, which also occupy the US pavilion, constantly play between highly crafted ceramics and references to a racist past. Impressive as Sonia Boyce’s British pavilion show is, I was just as moved by the resilience, wit and passion of French-Algerian artist Zineb Sedira in the nearby French enclosure. A neighbour and friend of Boyce’s in Brixton, Sedira celebrates communality, a life lived, engagements with politics and music, film and family and friends. She has transformed the front of the pavilion into a bar. A woman sits at a table. A man stands idly by. Suddenly music strikes up and they tango. At one point, the woman fixes her lipstick in an imaginary mirror, inches from my face. What Sedira gives us are her habitats, including a room filled with reels of her films and cinematography paraphernalia, as well as a model stage set of her home. There’s also a cinema where she narrates scenes from her life and re-enacts movies she has loved. There’s a great sense of the porousness between the real and the imaginary, the present and the remembered. In another rear room, a plain coffin sits on a trestle, the lid not yet nailed down. The sense of play in Sedira’s work continues in Francis Alÿs’s Belgian pavilion, where he shows films of kids from all around the world playing games: clapping at hovering clouds of mosquitoes, holding races with complicated rules between live snails painted different colours, dodging the traffic and the trams in Hong Kong, rolling a big truck tyre up a vast slag heap in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, only to roll back down while wedged inside it – a game so Sisyphean, arduous and dangerous, you wonder that the kids dare play it at all. We also forget play at our peril, and kids as much as artists make sense of the world through creative interaction. Austria and Brazil were playful too, but some other pavilions are just hard work. Maria Eichhorn has had the foundations of the German pavilion excavated and plaster removed from the walls to reveal the joins between the original 1909 Bavarian pavilion and the Nazi-built 1938 extension. She has also published a companion to the guided tours that commemorate anti-fascist resistance in Venice during the German occupation, and the deportation and murder of Venice’s Jews. Eichhorn’s work can’t fail to remind us of Hans Haacke’s 1993 Germania, in which he tore up the pavilion floor with jack-hammers. Spanish artist Ignasi Aballíhas “corrected” the Spanish pavilion by adding new walls at a 10-degree angle to the original structure, to effectively – or rather, to ineffectually – realign the pavilion. In the Danish pavilion, a hanged male centaur dangles while his female companion gives birth on the floor. Some games really aren’t worth playing. But others really are. The Polish pavilion is one of the biennale’s highlights, its walls covered in Polish-Romani artist Malgorzata Mirga-Tas’s Re-Enchanting the World, a long series of textile images derived from the cycle of Renaissance frescoes in the Palazzo Schifanoia in Ferrara. Cycles of images and signs follow both the calendar year and the historical migrations of the Roma people, re-appropriating the 17th-century prints of Jacques Callot, with their racist subtexts. Mirga-Tas reinvents these as patchwork scenes from everyday Roma life, collaging fabrics gathered from the Roma settlement in Poland where she lives. These tripartite images also include astrological symbols and signs from the Tarot, covering the walls in an epic of symbolism and history. The whole thing is glorious. Two large screens face one another in a cavernous 16th-century salt warehouse on Dorsoduro, where grime artists Lady Sanity and TrueMendous, filmed in Tottenham, face off Egyptian rappers Joker and Raptor, performing in Cairo. Able to hear one another by phone, they feed off each other’s rhythms, breaks and lines, even though the two camps can’t understand one another. It’s a rapid tumble of wordplay, bitterness and anger, but what gets you most is its energy, drive and pulse, reporting back the emotional weather of both cities. This is all part of Canadian artist Stan Douglas’s presentation, which continues with a series of photographs in the Giardini. Meticulously staged shots of riots in Tottenham following the police shooting of Mark Duggan in 2011, protests in Tunis and in New York during Occupy Wall Street in the same year, continue the theme. This is the best work by Douglas I have seen. Documentary also informs the New Zealand pavilion’s Paradise Camp, a suite of tableau photographs and a “talk show” in which Samoa’s Fa’afafine, the culture’s traditional “third gender”, comment on and deconstruct the paintings of Paul Gauguin, which are also re-enacted in photographs, in a thoughtful show conceived by Japanese-Samoan artist Yuki Kihara. The social becomes the personal in You Are Another Me: A Cathedral of the Body by Romanian film-maker and researcher Adina Pintilie. Complex multi-screen interviews and conversations between partners – a gay couple, a disabled activist and his lover, a transgender activist and sex worker – are seen close up as they talk, touch and reflect on their bodies, relationships, lives and needs. Moving between screens, we get uncomfortably close. Sometimes I felt voyeuristic, aware of the discomfort of others, focusing as much on other visitors as on the participants themselves. I wondered whether a biennale such as Venice, where much of the audience wanders in and out, is the right setting for these intimate and occasionally harrowing encounters. Nevertheless, I was touched and grateful for the participants’ willingness to expose their inner selves to Pintilie, who has worked with them over several years. Another kind of intimacy informs Marlene Dumas’s Open–End, a large survey of her paintings at the Palazzo Grassi. Again, bodies are to the fore. Sometimes, paintings can say as much about human relationships as any amount of film footage or introspection. It is all a conundrum, as we beat ourselves at the boundaries between our inner selves, which we barely know, and the world of things and others outside ourselves. The mystery of consciousness is barely explained. “How do we know we are not zombies?”asks one participant in Human Brains: It Begins With an Idea, in a vast exhibition at the Fondazione Prada. The answer is: “We don’t.” Artist Taryn Simon and curator Udo Kittelmann have staged hours of monologue and discussion among scientists, neurologists and thinkers. Filled with artefacts, scrolls, models, documents, paintings, anatomical studies, drawings of neurons and speculations on the seat of the soul, as well as voiceovers by numerous fiction writers, the exhibition attempts an understanding of how the brain works and how we think and feel. We go from ancient Sumerian cuneiform texts to brain scans, model operating theatres and the machinery of electro-convulsive therapy. Gruesome, informative, speculative and historical, Human Brains could keep you enthralled for days. It is as much about what we don’t know about consciousness as what we do. After all that looking and talking, being engrossed and being repelled by the biennale, it is a fitting counterpoint to our enduring ignorance.
