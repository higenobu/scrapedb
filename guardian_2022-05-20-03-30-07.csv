5/20/2022,"Multi-hyphenate pop star Rihanna and rapper A$AP Rocky have welcomed their first child, according to a TMZ report. The baby boy was reportedly born on 13 May in Los Angeles. No name was given. The couple, together since early 2020, first announced their pregnancy with a heavily photographed stroll through A$AP Rocky’s hometown of New York in January. The fashion mogul and Fenty beauty founder has since made headlines for her trend-setting maternity style of sheer lace, crop tops and belly-baring outfits. “When I found out I was pregnant, I thought to myself, There’s no way I’m going to go shopping in no maternity aisle,” the 34-year-old singer told Vogue in April. “I’m sorry — it’s too much fun to get dressed up. I’m not going to let that part disappear because my body is changing.” “I’m hoping that we were able to redefine what’s considered ‘decent’ for pregnant women,” she elaborated. “My body is doing incredible things right now, and I’m not going to be ashamed of that. This time should feel celebratory. Because why should you be hiding your pregnancy?” In the same interview, the Grammy-winning performer, who has not released an album since 2016’s Anti, teased long-anticipated new music, but did not specify when. “I’m looking at my next project completely differently from the way I had wanted to put it out before. I think this way suits me better, a lot better,” she said. “It’s authentic, it’ll be fun for me, and it takes a lot of the pressure off.” She is also the subject of a long-gestating documentary by Battleship director Peter Berg. The as-yet untitled film, which currently has no official release date, was purchased by Amazon for $25m in 2019. The birth comes less than a month after A$AP Rocky, legal name Rakim Mayers, was arrested while returning from holiday in Barbados in connection with a previously unreported November 2021 shooting. Los Angeles police were investigating Mayers’ involvement in the shooting, in which he allegedly fired several shots at an acquaintance, grazing his hand.",Arts/Music,Rihanna and A$AP Rocky welcome their first child – report,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/19/rihanna-baby-born-asap-rocky
5/20/2022,"Joe Biden has invoked the Defense Production Act to address the shortage of infant formula by speeding production and authorizing flights to import it from abroad, as experts warned desperate parents not to concoct their own “home brew” alternatives. The safety-related closure of the nation’s largest formula manufacturing plant has seen a nationwide squeeze on supply. The Defense Production Act order requires suppliers of formula manufacturers to fulfill orders from those companies before other customers, in an effort to eliminate production bottlenecks. Biden is also authorizing the US defense department to use commercial aircraft to fly in from overseas formula supplies that meet federal standards, in what the White House is calling “Operation Fly Formula”. “Bypassing traditional cargo routes will speed up the importation and distribution of formula and serve as an immediate support as manufacturers continue to ramp up production,” a senior administration official told reporters on a call Thursday. Under pressure from parents and lawmakers, the official acknowledged that availability varied by state and said the administration was prepared “to pull every lever” to address the shortage. Supplies of baby formula across the country have been severely curtailed in recent weeks after a February recall by Abbott exacerbated supply chain disruptions among formula makers, leaving fewer options on store shelves and anxious parents struggling to find nutrition for their children. Although baby formula has already been affected by pandemic-related supply chain problems, the nationwide shortage has severely worsened in the three months after Abbott’s recall, which occurred as a result of illnesses and deaths among infants. In March, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a warning to consumers, urging them to be aware of certain products branded Similac, Alimentum and EleCare that have been recalled. The FDA launched an investigation after complaints emerged of bacterial infections in four infants who consumed powdered infant formula produced in Abbott Nutrition’s facility in Michigan. According to the reports, all four infants were hospitalized and the bacterial infection may have contributed to the deaths of two of them. All four cases involved the Cronobacter sakazakii infection, which according to the FDA “can cause severe, life-threatening infections (sepsis) or meningitis (an inflammation of the membranes that protect the brain and spine)”. Cronobacter infections are rare but are especially high-risk for newborns, the agency said. As a result of the recall, approximately 30% of popular baby formula brands may be sold out across the nation, according to an analysis by Datasembly, which assessed supplies in over 11,000 stores. The shortage has hit poorer families the hardest. Nearly half of the baby formula in the country is purchased under the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, also known as WIC. WIC is primarily aimed at helping low-income women, infants and children across the nation. Abbott provides formula to approximately half of the infants who are receiving Wic benefits and is just one of the four companies that produce approximately 90% of US formula. Earlier this week, Abbott reached an agreement with US health regulators to resume production at its largest domestic factory. The factory, located in Sturgis, Michigan, has been under investigation in recent months due to safety concerns. Monday’s legally binding agreement between the company and the FDA outlines various steps the company needs to take to reopen its plant. Nevertheless, despite the agreement, Abbott has said that it will take between six and eight weeks before more formula starts arriving on American shelves. In the meantime, parents have been warned not to concoct their own formulas at home. In recent weeks, experts have seen parents using 60-year old recipes, diluting formulas and creating other homemade alternatives. According to experts, such so-called “home brews” can be dangerous due to challenges with sterility, insufficiency in critical nutrients such as iron. “The standard by which we develop infant formula is breast milk. We’ve come to understand breast milk better and better,” Steven Abrams, former chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Nutrition, told the BBC. “If they’re not breastfeeding, [the formula] has got to have all the nutrients in there”. The American Academy of Pediatrics has advised parents to check smaller stores and drug stores for formula and purchase formula online from well-recognized distributors and pharmacies. It has also said that cow’s milk may be an option if a child is older than six months and is usually on regular formula. Nevertheless, such an alternative is “not ideal and should not become routine,” the organisation said.",News/US news,Biden uses Defense Production Act to tackle US baby formula crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/biden-defense-production-act-baby-formula-shortage-crisis
5/20/2022,"An officer involved in Sheku Bayoh’s arrest has admitted that police fired CS spray and pepper spray at him without warning even though he made no direct threat and did not show any weapons. Bayoh, a father of two, died in hospital in handcuffs in May 2015 in Kirkcaldy, Fife. He had multiple injuries after being hit with police batons, and being shackled and held on the ground by numerous officers. PC Craig Walker told a public inquiry into Bayoh’s death in custody that he and former PC Alan Paton believed that Bayoh might have been carrying a knife and had been threatening the public. Walker and Paton were the first officers to confront Bayoh, formerly from Sierra Leone, after police received repeated calls from the public about a man brandishing a knife on the streets, behaving erratically and hitting a vehicle at about 7am on a Sunday. Bayoh’s family believe he died from positional asphyxia because of the tactics used by police, who they allege over-reacted and were motivated by racial bias. The public inquiry under Lord Bracadale, a senior judge, was set up after their long campaign for an independent investigation into his death. Walker, the first officer involved in Bayoh’s arrest to appear at the inquiry, was questioned by Angela Grahame QC, counsel to the inquiry, about the seconds after he and Paton arrived at the scene. The inquiry heard that Paton, who has yet to give evidence, told Bayoh to “get down on the fucking ground” and, without warning him, sprayed CS gas towards Bayoh’s face. “So when the spray was used at that point, [Bayoh] is not acting aggressively, there’s no sign of a knife, he is not attacking PC Paton,” Grahame said to Walker. “He’s walking [and] effectively he’s just simply ignoring the comment from PC Paton. Is that right?” Walker confirmed there was no knife visible on Bayoh, but answered: “He’s not following instructions; he’s not complying.” Walker, who earlier denied any racial motivation in his decision-making, said both officers believed Bayoh could have had a knife concealed under his white T-shirt, either stuffed into a pocket or under his waistband, and that had he run off, he could have posed a threat to the public. Walker said Paton’s CS spray failed to hit Bayoh and instead was blown back into Paton’s eyes and face. Walker then shouted at Bayoh, who turned around to face Walker and then walked in his direction, he said. Walker shouted for Bayoh to stop and, without warning him, used his pepper spray. Bayoh seemed to be unaffected but some hit Walker in the eyes, immediately affecting his vision. Under questioning from Grahame, Walker confirmed that neither he nor Paton asked Bayoh whether he was unwell or whether he was carrying a knife, nor did they retreat to allow Bayoh time to respond. Walker admitted that Bayoh was walking along the road “in a calm-ish manner” but had been non-responsive, and had a “thousand-yard stare”. He told Grahame: “We weren’t taking any chances.” The inquiry will continue on Friday.",News/UK news,"Officer fired CS spray at Sheku Bayoh despite lack of direct threat, inquiry told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/sheku-bayoh-public-inquiry-police-scotland
5/20/2022,"The prime minister had been telling colleagues for weeks that he believed he would receive no further fines for breaching Covid rules, but many saw it as little more than typical Johnsonian bluster. When it emerged on Thursday that he was correct – despite attending several of the dozen booze-fuelled gatherings held on his watch – one exasperated backbencher said simply: “No words.” With Johnson reassured by the Metropolitan police that they will take no further action, his team are now close to getting the closure they have long hoped for. It appears for the moment that “Operation Save Big Dog”, as he reportedly called the effort to protect him, has succeeded. Several senior figures were sacrificed over the scandal, including Johnson’s director of communications Jack Doyle and chief of staff Dan Rosenfield – as well as his press secretary, Allegra Stratton, who resigned after being caught on film joking about a “cheese and wine” gathering she didn’t even attend. The prime minister will give his own account in a public statement next week, no doubt adopting a similar apologetic tone to that seen in previous Partygate revelations, though it rarely appears to last much beyond his moment at the dispatch box. Conveniently for No 10, the waters have been nicely muddied by the fact that the clean-living Rishi Sunak also received a fixed penalty notice (FPN) for the one event Johnson was fined for – and that the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, is now being investigated by Durham constabulary over an alleged lockdown breach. Of course, Johnson must still survive the scrutiny of Sue Gray, the senior civil servant whose full report into the party culture in locked-down Downing Street is now expected next week. Gray’s truncated report, published in January, already highlighted what she called “failures of leadership and judgment by different parts of No 10 and the Cabinet Office at different times”, though she declined to specify individual names. Johnson deliberately chose to interpret it at the time not as an indictment of his behaviour, but rather a plea for a shake-up in the management structures within No 10. Ministers such as Oliver Dowden reinforced that reading, claiming the prime minister was tackling the rotten culture that had developed in Downing Street. But former insiders insist Johnson was absolutely central to the boozy culture that developed among his team, praising them for letting off steam and sometimes pouring drinks himself. But senior civil servants were also culpable, and the balance of fines – with just one falling to the prime minister, 125 to others – will strengthen Johnson’s argument that he wasn’t the driving force behind many of the events, despite being the most senior person in the building. Gray’s final report is expected to set out the details of what took place at each of the gatherings she investigated. Much of that information is already in the public domain, but seeing it in black and white may still be shocking. The question for backbench MPs will be to what extent they choose to hold the prime minister responsible for what took place. Many have remained carefully on the fence, citing the importance of allowing the Met and Gray investigations to take their course. They will now have to decide whether they can defend him in public. Johnson also faces a privileges committee investigation in the weeks ahead that will examine whether he misled parliament by claiming all guidance was followed in No 10 – a misdemeanour that according to the ministerial code should result in resignation. There are more moments of danger ahead, too, including two crucial byelections on 23 June, in Wakefield and Tiverton – which Labour and the Liberal Democrats respectively are optimistic about winning – and the bleak outlook for living standards, with Sunak and Johnson under intense pressure to do more to help. Even if MPs conclude that receiving just a single FPN helps to airbrush out Johnson’s role in Partygate, the public may decide otherwise. “The fact remains that he’s still been fined, and this doesn’t erode that or take that away, so in terms of the seriousness of the situation I don’t think it changes anything,” said pollster James Johnson, of JL Partners. “It stops a bad situation getting worse; but the public made up their mind a long time ago.”",News/Politics,Johnson may believe he’s safe but threat from Partygate is not over,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/19/johnson-may-believe-hes-safe-but-threat-from-partygate-is-not-over
5/20/2022,"The US president, Joe Biden, has welcomed the Finnish and Swedish leaders to the White House promising full support for their membership applications to what he called a “revived Nato” in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. In their remarks in the Rose Garden, the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, and the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, addressed the only major barrier to their countries’ accession to the alliance: the objections of the Turkish leader, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who restated on Thursday his resolve to veto their membership. “We will continue our policy in a determined way. We have told allies that we will say no to Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership,” Erdoğan told Turkish students in a video uploaded on his official Twitter account. All 30 alliance members have to approve the acceptance of a new ally. Erdoğan accused Sweden and Finland of harbouring and financing the Kurdistan Workers party militant group and Syrian Kurdish YPG, who he deems to be “terrorists”. In his Rose Garden comments, Niinistö addressed those accusations directly. “Finland has always had proud and good bilateral relations with Turkey. As Nato allies, we will commit to Turkey’s security, just as Turkey will commit to our security,” the Finnish president said. “We take terrorism seriously. We condemn terrorism in all its forms and we are actively engaged in combating it. We are open to discussing all the concerns Turkey may have concerning our membership in an open and constructive manner. These discussions have already taken place and they will continue in the next days.” He emphasised the contribution that Finland would make to the alliance. “Finland’s armed forces are one of the strongest in Europe,” Niinistö said. “We have also consistently invested in developing capabilities. The Finns’ willingness to defend the country is one of the highest in the whole world.” In her speech, Andersson said that the Swedish government was “right now having a dialogue with all Nato member countries, including Turkey, on different levels to sort out any issues at hand”. She underlined the historic shift that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine had brought about. “After 200 years of military non-alignment, Sweden has chosen a new path,” the Swedish prime minister said. “Russia’s full scale aggression against a sovereign and democratic neighbour was a watershed moment for Sweden. And my government has come to the conclusion that the security of the Swedish people will be best protected within the Nato alliance. And this is backed by very broad support in the Swedish parliament.” Biden did not refer to Turkish opposition in his upbeat speech outside the White House, but noted that both candidate Nato members “meet every Nato requirement and then some”. “Having two new Nato members in the high north will enhance the security of our alliances and deepen our security cooperation across the board,” the US president said. “Today there is no question Nato is relevant, that it’s effective and that it’s more needed now than ever.” The US security adviser, Jake Sullivan, said on Wednesday that US officials were also talking to Turkish officials to seek a resolution. “You’ve got a raucous collection of states that all have opinions, that all have perspectives, that all have interests,” Sullivan said. “But they also know how to, and when to, pull together and how to settle any differences. And I expect these differences will be settled.” Asked about the Turkish threat on Wednesday, Biden told reporters “I think we’re going to be OK.”",News/World news,Joe Biden gives support to Sweden and Finland as members of ‘revived Nato’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/joe-biden-gives-support-to-sweden-and-finland-as-members-of-revived-nato
5/20/2022,"No question about it: Richard Harpin, chief executive of HomeServe, has an uplifting tale to tell about entrepreneurial success in the unfashionable business of fixing pipes and boilers and selling parallel insurance policies via utility companies. He co-founded the business in 1993 with £500,000 of backing from South Staffordshire Water. Now HomeServe has 9,000 staff in 10 countries. Agreeing a £4.1bn sale – or £4.8bn including debt – to Canadian property and infrastructure giant Brookfield is an achievement and a half. Harpin will see his stake valued at £300m and his wife’s at almost £200m. Yet it’s hard to describe the takeover terms as supremely generous given how far HomeServe had already travelled during its 18 years on the London stock market, a period in which it paid £800m in dividends to shareholders. Yes, at first glance, a 71% premium to the share price before the Canadians turned up in March looks lovely. But it’s also true that HomeServe’s shares had traded above the take-out price of £12 a share before Covid. This is not a case of going out on a high. The pre-Brookfield drift in the shares seems to have been caused by little more than a sense that lockdown is over, that repairs insurance is a deferrable purchase and that tradespeople are in short supply for HomeServe’s Checkatrade platform. Nothing fundamental, in other words. As the document put it: “HomeServe has emerged from the Covid pandemic with all three business divisions performing strongly and well positioned for continued growth.” So why sell? There may be a clue in Harpin’s reference to how Brookfield is “committed to providing long-term capital”. If that was a dig at short-termist fund managers, it seems a little unfair on this occasion. HomeServe has been able to conquer the US – now its biggest market – while in listed form, so the public market shareholders weren’t entirely safety-first plodders. Stockbroker Davy values the sum of HomeServe’s parts at £11 a share, and had a long-term cashflow-based estimate of £15.50, so an exit at £12 doesn’t feel terrific. Nor does Harpin’s current refusal to say whether he’ll stay with the business under new ownership, which is surely information that shareholders could expect to be told. They’ll take a cash bidder’s money because they (almost) always do, but there’s still an unsatisfactory air of opportunism about this takeover. It doesn’t really need to happen. “We are at a crossroads with the transformation of Royal Mail,” says Keith Williams, the postal service group’s chairman. A version of that statement has been heard most years since privatisation in 2013. Unfortunately, it’s usually accurate. Two years ago Williams himself, recruited to inject life into a stalled restructuring programme, issued a thunderous “we need to change” message as the pandemic accelerated the rise of parcels and the decline of letters. Now the call is for more urgency under post-lockdown conditions. That is partly because the group hasn’t delivered all the intended savings under its key “pathway to change” agreement. A theoretical £100m-plus has become £59m on arrival, an outcome that jars with the refrain only six months ago that “improved colleague and trade union engagement” was allowing efficiencies to flow. The next engagement with the CWU is a pay round that has entered a disputes process. There hasn’t been a strike at Royal Mail since privatisation, so a deal is the way to bet, but a backdrop of general inflation at 9% adds intensity to the talks. The company’s basic offer is only 2%, even if it would prefer to emphasise the conditional elements that allow an “up to 5.5%” description. The stock market, meanwhile, is doing its own sums and has concluded that a miracle in Royal Mail’s fortunes did not occur during Covid’s parcel boom. The share price, having soared from 125p to 527p between April 2020 and May 2021, is back at 300p, down 12% on Thursday. Automation of parcel-sorting is happening, allowing chunkier savings of £350m-plus to be generated if all goes to plan this time. And last year’s pre-tax profits for the group (half of which is the GLS international business) of £707m, up 6.5%, are not to be sniffed at. The group may even get away with price rises. But the phrase that resonated in the statement was the warning of a “downside risk” to estimates of operating profits of £303m for the UK Royal Mail business. The risk currently looks real: momentum seems to have evaporated very suddenly.",News/Business,HomeServe’s recent share price drift makes its buyer look opportunistic | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/may/19/homeserves-recent-share-price-drift-makes-its-buyer-look-opportunistic
5/20/2022,"The sweetness of winning millions on the lottery can quickly turn sour. The trick is knowing how to spend it, according to some cautionary tales of previous winners. It does not always end badly, but there have been plenty of stories about the “curse of the lottery”, featuring drug addiction, destitution and prison. Here’s what happened to four previous winners. Callie Rogers At 16, Rogers – who worked on a shop checkout in Cumbria – was one of the lottery’s youngest winners when she bagged £1.9m in 2003. She bought new homes for herself and her mother. But she ended up frittering away the rest of her winnings on parties, plastic surgery and drugs. In 2021 she was reported to be struggling to bring up four children on universal credit. Michael Carroll The former refuse worker, who bought his lottery ticket while wearing an electronic tag, called himself the “king of chavs” after he won almost £10m in 2002. He bought a six-bedroom house in Norfolk and £1m of Glasgow Rangers shares. He then paid out £1.4m in a divorce settlement, and later admitted that he thought about only three things – “drugs, sex and gold”. He spent time in jail for affray and was declared bankrupt in 2010. Lee Ryan Ryan was one of the first winners, scooping £6.5m weeks after the national lottery was launched in 1994. He spent his winnings on luxury cars, a helicopter and a £2m mansion. He was later jailed for handling stolen cars and spent time sleeping rough in London. He said his jackpot was “cursed”. Brian Caswell The grandfather from Bolton won £25m on EuroMillions in 2009 and did not squander it. He bought houses for his daughters and a new allotment. He also set up a charity. He did once hire a private jet for a family holiday, but he still drinks in his local pub.

5/20/2022,"Has Boris Johnson wriggled free of Partygate? The news that the prime minister will not receive any further fines over the scandal suggests he might. But Mr Johnson is not out of danger. The Metropolitan police’s investigation confirms that Downing Street held boozy parties while the rest of the country was under strict Covid lockdown. The prime minister’s attempts to dodge blame in front of MPs revealed his dishonesty. Next week will bring the publication of the much-awaited report by Sue Gray, a veteran civil servant, into the parties at Downing Street. This will give a fuller picture of the breaches of the criminal law that took place in No 10. When the privileges committee begins its work, Mr Johnson will become the only prime minister to be investigated over claims that he intentionally misled parliament, in relation to this scandal. Tory MPs could force Mr Johnson from office. If he survives, it would be ironic if Sir Keir Starmer goes. The Labour leader said that he would stick by his principles and resign if he is fined by Durham constabulary for breaking Covid rules. Such an outcome would leave politics poorer and underline Mr Johnson’s lack of scruples. Should both men stay in place, however, it will be the prime minister who faces a continuing threat of eviction from his position. Mr Johnson is not in control of his own premiership. This is compounded by his lack of gravity in a crisis. With stagflation setting in, Mr Johnson is more interested in slogans than substance. He has yet to offer concrete measures to tackle the cost of living crisis. Voters’ patience is wearing thin. The Tories are slipping further behind Labour in the polls. The trouble is that Mr Johnson has little time for self-reflection. Last year he wanted to become the longest-serving British prime minister of modern times. Hubris is the folly of a leader who through conceit challenges the gods. It is followed ultimately by nemesis. Mr Johnson’s arrogance and complacency in the face of mounting problems will have electoral consequences. The prime minister’s inflated sense of entitlement rankles with the public. More than 120 fines were issued for law-breaking in Downing Street. Mr Johnson – and his chancellor, Rishi Sunak – were in April found to have broken lockdown rules by holding the prime minister’s birthday party indoors when ordinary voters could not even hold dying loved ones. Did they not know the rules they set for the rest of the country? Ignorance might be a defence for a prime minister; stupidity is not. More plausible is that Mr Johnson did not care about the rules, or perhaps thought that they only applied to underlings. The police accepted, somewhat bizarrely, that Mr Johnson could have had a “reasonable excuse” to attend illegal gatherings when junior officials could not. This may be because the prime minister can afford better lawyers than his staff. But double standards corrupt public life from the top down. For Mr Johnson, lying in politics is as natural as swimming in water. The prime minister agreed to a customs border in the Irish Sea to get Brexit done. He now pretends he did not. The lockdown breaches show just how out of touch Mr Johnson has become. Tory MPs must know that their party has lost its way.

5/20/2022,"When Covid-19 first emerged, the “Hermit Kingdom” lived up to its nickname – shutting its borders in January 2020, long before most of the world had taken real heed of the disease spreading in China. With healthcare already on its knees and a malnourished population, North Korea was exceptionally badly placed to cope with any serious outbreak of illness. For more than two years, it insisted that it had no cases whatsoever. Then, last week, it announced its first cases, of Omicron. The country’s leader, Kim Jong-un, warned of “great turmoil”. Now it has reported almost 2m cases of unspecified “fever” – probably because it can’t test for the virus – with 741,000 still being treated, and 63 deaths. Mr Kim, due to celebrate his 10th anniversary in power this year, has blamed officials for an “immature” response. But underlings can hardly be blamed. Closing the country off for so long, when it is heavily dependent on China and ordinary people were already struggling to survive, has left many in even direr straits. Yet the leadership failed to use the time to vaccinate the population, ignoring offers of doses from the Covax pooling scheme. For years, it has impoverished its people and allowed healthcare to deteriorate, while pouring money into a weapons programme, the chief function of which is to safeguard the regime. Within hours of announcing the Covid outbreak, the country had launched yet another missile test. Since admitting the outbreak, it has stonewalled offers of help from South Korea and the World Health Organization, although it has accepted basic medical supplies from China. Not only are medicine and oxygen supplies scarce, even power is limited, with blackouts frequent. The country needs medical equipment, fridges, generators and fuel as well as vaccine doses. Humanitarian waivers to sanctions will be necessary, as well as persuading Pyongyang to accept help. North Koreans must not suffer further for the regime’s actions. The wealthier world should also remember that North Korea is not alone in its lack of protection. Other countries are not much better covered. The more than 12bn vaccine doses delivered globally have overwhelmingly gone to richer nations. More than 75% of people in upper- and middle-income countries have received at least two doses. For low-income countries, the figure is just 13%. Across Africa, only 16.7% have received two doses or more. There is now sufficient supply. But by hogging doses initially, richer countries held up delivery in poorer countries that lack the capacity to carry out mass vaccination at speed. And many of those places – where the vaccine drive may face problems ranging from inadequate infrastructure to military conflict – will need additional help to ensure that vaccines reach people, and that people want them. Treatments for Covid must also be made widely available. The $4.8bn committed to funding vaccine programmes last month is good news. But making progress on a patent waiver is also essential, and beyond that, prioritising broader knowledge-sharing and diversification of supply. As WHO officials noted, when asked about North Korea and Eritrea – which has also snubbed offers of vaccines – unchecked transmission could spur the emergence of new variants. Though wealthier countries are far better protected, they too could still be at risk from the pandemic – or new diseases in future. Self-interest, as well as a sense of responsibility, should persuade them to do the right thing.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on low Covid vaccination rates: not just North Korea | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/19/the-guardian-view-on-low-covid-vaccination-rates-not-just-north-korea
5/20/2022,"The first all-Black climbing group to reach the summit of Mount Everest was recovering back at the bottom of the mountain on Thursday and celebrating a journey to the “top of the world”. Seven members of the US-led team made it to the top of the mountain in one expedition, greatly increasing the number of Black people who have summited the world’s highest peak from 10 to 17, out of about 10,000 in total. Manoah Ainuu, a professional climber from Spokane, Washington, was among the group and said he exceeded his high expectations in getting to the summit of Everest for the first time. “Up there, it’s a little cold,” he told the NBC Today show on Thursday morning, eliciting laughs from the hosts, as he beamed in by video with a drink in hand from Kathmandu, Nepal, where the successful team was resting. “Down here, and on the journey to the top of the world, every place is amazing, everyone is amazing, so, yup, it’s all good,” Ainuu said. The group calls itself the Full Circle Everest expedition. On their website they write: “In 1963, the first American expedition reached the summit of Everest. That same year Dr Martin Luther King delivered his historic I Have A Dream speech. It took 40 more years for the first Black climber to summit Everest. Still, there has never been an all-Black team to summit the tallest mountain on Earth. “This expedition will showcase the tenacity and strength of these climbers, and highlight the barriers that continue to exist for Black communities in accessing the outdoors.” Members of the group climbed the tough Mount Rainier in Washington last year, then after intense training they set off for the Himalayas. With a team of Sherpa climbers they reached base camp, then departed on 2 May for the summit. Some did not make the top, but seven did, on 12 May. “This is a huge accomplishment … now we’re able to take this experience and take it back to our communities and tell the stories, share what we’ve learned of this beautiful place and culture and hopefully inspire a future generation of outdoor enthusiasts,” successful summiteer Rosemary Saal told Today on Thursday.

The Met took many by surprise by declaring that Operation Hillman, its investigation into claims of illegal gatherings in Downing Street and Westminster during the Covid pandemic, had concluded with Boris Johnson to face no further fines. The force said a total of 126 fixed-penalty notices (FPNs) had been levied against 83 people, on eight dates from May 2020 to April 2021. It declined to say which events fines had been issued for; on some dates there was more than one questionable gathering. The Met investigation involved 12 full-time officers, with extra support when required, and cost £460,000. There were no face-to-face interviews, with all questions put to suspects in written questionnaires. What do we actually know about those who got fined? At least one of the recipients got five fines, with a total of 28 people getting multiple FPNs. Of the 126 fines issued, 53 were given to 35 men and 73 to 48 women. In virtually all cases FPNs will be £50 if paid on time. The Met decided from the start they would not name those fined, nor state their seniority in government, because of national guidance. But Johnson, his wife, Carrie, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, have previously confirmed they received one fine each for celebrating the prime minister’s birthday in Downing Street in June 2020. Helen MacNamara, the government’s former head of ethics, also confirmed she got an FPN for a leaving do for a fellow civil servant in the same month. The Met said no one had contested the fines and most had paid already. What rationale did the Met use for issuing fines? The simplest criteria was clear evidence of law-breaking by people who knew or should have known what the rules were. The force said: “A team of 12 detectives worked through 345 documents, including emails, door logs, diary entries and witness statements, 510 photographs and CCTV images and 204 questionnaires as part of a careful and thorough enquiry.” A policing source said the Met were looking for “slam dunk” cases, so strong that they were very unlikely to be challenged, and in their statement the force seemed to confirm that. “Each line of enquiry looked at the date, the circumstances behind each event, and the actions of the individual, benchmarked against the legislation at that time, to establish whether their behaviour met the criminal threshold for an FPN referral to be made,” the Met said. “We took great care to ensure that for each referral we had the necessary evidence to prosecute the FPN at court, were it not paid.” Covid rules changed scores of times during the pandemic and the Met said this meant that “not all events were subject to the same restrictions”. Initially the Met refused to investigate Partygate – . Do they now admit this was a mistake? No. In reality, the force was waiting for findings from the senior civil servant Sue Gray’s as part of her inquiry for the Cabinet Office. It did not want to launch its own investigation only for the Gray inquiry to find no wrongdoing. While it says it acts without fear or favour, the Met has painful experience of tangling with politicians and the powerful. Are all questions now answered and is Partygate over for the Met? It is definitely not over. After the Met’s investigation comes the reckoning, including in the court of public opinion. The revelation that Johnson would escape with only one fine, despite claims he was an active participant at multiple events including serving drinks, has caused consternation. One of the Met’s justifications for investigating was a fear that failure to launch a probe would damage confidence in the legitimacy of the law. The conclusion of the inquiry may still yet do that, long-term observers warn. Former Met police chief and now Liberal Democrat peer Brian Paddick warned the force was open to claims it had bungled the investigation unless it explained itself. “The Met has no defence to the accusation that it gave the prime minister one FPN as that was the minimum he could be fined, but did not do so for other events for political reasons. “The decision not to explain is a mistake. It was a mistake not to investigate in the first place. They said there was no need to investigate and then they issued 126 fines, which is not good for their credibility.” A new test of the Met’s credibility will be the publication of the full Gray report, expected next week. People will match the findings against the Met’s. Paddick said: “There could be further questions for the Met to answer if Gray identifies the prime minister as being present at a party which Gray says breaks the rules.” The Met’s acting deputy commissioner, Helen Ball, said: “I think a number of people, members of the public, have been both surprised and concerned [about] what they have heard and I’m sure they will be surprised and concerned about the outcome of our investigation.” She is almost certainly right, but maybe not in the way she intended.",News/UK news,Partygate inquiry: what police said and the dangers for the Met,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/19/partygate-inquiry-what-police-said-and-the-dangers-for-the-met
5/20/2022,"Here’s a thing – it turns out that the same parties were illegal for some people but fair enough for others. Schrödinger’s parties. Boris Johnson’s exceptionalism has been indulged yet again, as it’s generally only the little people – the expendable junior members of staff at No 10 – who have been fined over Partygate. The Convict picked up just the one fine, for the party that was arguably not a party at all – when he was ambushed by cake on his birthday. Go figure. But on the whole, the prime minister decided he could settle for that. It had taught him an important lesson: never rely on Suella Braverman for legal advice. Getting the half-witted attorney general to fill out his police questionnaire had been a huge mistake. So, for all the other parties, he got a top QC to defend him. That wasn’t all. The birthday do also had the huge benefit of seeing his main leadership rival completely screwed over. Rishi Sunak has never recovered from the shame, something Johnson has never suffered from. His narcissism has its advantages. The chancellor has learned the hard way that people invariably expect higher standards of others than they do of Boris. The Convict’s rule-breaking and lying was priced in. Literally no one cared. So to see off Sunak had been worth the £50 fine. After all, he hadn’t reckoned back then on his chancellor being so spectacularly bad at chancelloring and that the government would be failing to deal with a cost of living crisis. So it has been a win-win. All the same, it has been a matter of pride for Johnson to see if he could escape any further fines and it has turned out to be surprisingly easy. Mainly because the Metropolitan police has – for reasons best know to itself – been hell-bent on trashing what remained of its credibility. Still, he couldn’t have known the Old Bill would prove so obligingly incompetent. Not to mention credulous. It was no wonder their crime clear-up rates were so consistently poor. Even though No 10 was the country’s most law-breaking party venue and Sue Gray had gone out of her way to list all the different occasions – she had even provided dates, venues and offenders! – on which illegal gatherings had taken place, the Met had failed to nab most of the suspects. Just the few who have been dim enough to admit their guilt. So, the Convict has set about compiling his defence with his counsel. First the generalities, the things that applied to every charge. Where to start? Well obviously that the government had changed the rules for lockdown. And Johnson had been so exhausted explaining what was required from people at the nightly press conferences that it had completely escaped his attention that he was bound by the same rules. An easy mistake to make from someone who often needs reminding that the rules also apply to him. Plus it had never occurred to him that the riff raff might actually take him seriously and obey the law. If people were dumb enough not to visit their dying relatives, then more fool them. Really. Then there was the “Do what you like” culture of No 10. There would be hell to pay when Johnson found out who was in charge of Downing Street. The man – if it was a man – must have been half asleep most of the time. No one had been more shocked than the Convict that all these parties had taken place right under his nose. Some had been arranged so secretively that people such as him hadn’t even been aware they were taking place even when they were actually at them. That was the level of deception going on. On to the details. First there had been the bring your own bottle party. Johnson had thought his then principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds – Party Marty – had just been reminding staff to remember their water bottles during the hot weather. Nor could he remember getting an email that mentioned a party. The one he had received had said there would be a BYOB work event. And when he and Carrie had wandered downstairs after work – whoops, during work – he had been amazed to find the garden packed with people getting pissed and helping themselves to food off trestle tables that had been put up for the occasion. Mind you, it had never occurred to him that anyone might think this was a party because, why would you? It was clearly a work event with people talking about how tricky it is to get pissed with other people these days due to the Covid restrictions. In any case, he hadn’t wanted to make a fuss because he wasn’t sure who was in charge at No 10. So he and Carrie had just tiptoed off back to the flat. No one had been more amazed than he to find security fishing staff and empties out of the flower bed the following morning. Just a really great work event. The team objectives for the session had been for everyone to get trashed, and they had been met. In any case, the law had been so badly worded – you can’t get the governments these days – that it was technically legal to have a party. Providing no one turned up. The party in the No 10 flat had been rather different. It had nothing to do with celebrating Dominic Cummings’s exit. That was just a smear. Carrie had just been doing an online zumba class to “The Winner Takes It All” while some of her mates pretended they weren’t there. And Johnson had just gone quietly to his bedroom so that he could change out of his wine-stained suit into his pyjamas before interviewing someone – he forgot who – for a job. It was all totally innocent. As for the other parties, no one could actually prove anything. There weren’t any photos – apart from the one with the tinsel – so everyone could just do one. The Convict stared down the Met. He stuck by his story that he had never known nuffink about anyfink. Anyone who said different was a liar. On his life. He fought the law, and the law lost.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson faces down the Met – as the little people get fines over Partygate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/19/boris-johnson-faces-down-the-met-as-the-little-people-get-fines-over-partygate
5/20/2022,"Australia had the highest levels of greenhouse gas pollution from coal per person than any other developed country in 2021, according to new data. But the data shows per capita greenhouse gas emissions from coal fell sharply last year, with a surge in solar and wind energy seeing per capita rates drop well below the average of the previous five years. Australia is the second most coal-dependant country for power generation in the OECD, behind Poland, according to the data compiled by UK-based think tank Ember. The Ember report says in 2021, emissions from coal amounted to 4.04 tonnes of CO2 for each person. The second-placed country was South Korea, with 3.18 tonnes a year, followed by China (3.06), South Africa (2.68) and the United States (2.23). A previous Ember report said between 2015 and 2020, Australia’s per capita coal emissions had averaged 5.34 tonnes a year. Even with this fall in Australia – which Ember put down to a rise in rooftop solar and wind power – the country was still the highest per capita coal emitter in both the G20 and the OECD. Australia’s high per capita coal emissions is almost four times the global average and double the rate in the United States and Japan. Among OECD countries, only Poland used a higher percentage of coal for electricity than Australia. While Australia’s solar boom was reducing coal use, there was still a long way to go, Ember’s global lead, Dave Jones, said. “Burning coal on this scale is setting the stage for many fire seasons to come,” he said. “The single biggest action the world can take to tackle the climate crisis is to rapidly transition away from antiquated coal power and towards the clean and renewables-based electricity system of the future.” According to Ember, the share of the demand for electricity in Australia that was met by fossil fuels fell from 79% in 2019 to 70% in 2021. At the same time, wind and solar rose from 13% to 22%. Earlier this week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, declined to offer a timeframe for when he thought coal would be phased out, saying this would be decided by coal plant operators. Morrison has previously said coal plants needed to run until the end of their lives, claiming prices always go up if coal plants close. According to government projections released in October, under current policies, by 2030 some 69% of electricity generation in the National Electricity Market (excluding Western Australia and the Northern Territory) will come from renewables. Labor’s pre-election Powering Australia Plan says renewables will generate 82% of electricity in the NEM by 2030. Across the country, emissions from electricity account for 34% of greenhouse gas emissions – the largest single sector.",News/Environment,"Australia’s greenhouse pollution from coal higher per person than any other developed country, data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/australias-greenhouse-pollution-from-coal-higher-per-person-than-any-other-developed-country-data-shows
5/20/2022,"The aged care sector has urged the government to reinstate Covid prevention funding as it grapples with outbreaks in almost 30% of the nation’s residential facilities. The call comes as aged care workers in South Australia and Queensland prepare to walk off the job over unfair pay and conditions. Last year, the government withdrew temporary financial support designed to help the sector manage the cost of deploying measures to prevent outbreaks at their facilities, including the purchase of personal protective equipment and rapid tests. The government instead established a grant program that allowed providers to apply for money to reimburse the costs of managing the direct impacts of a Covid-19 outbreak in their facility. But the sector has now claimed the new grants scheme has created a “perverse” situation, where providers who successfully avoid outbreaks, including by spending significant amounts on prevention, are punished financially. The problem was raised in a detailed report by the University of Technology Sydney Ageing Research Collaborative this week, which warned providers which were “proactive in managing infection control and are successful in avoiding outbreaks” were “unable to recoup this additional expenditure or losses of revenue through access to grants or subsidies”. The report found the withdrawal of temporary financial supports from the earlier stages of the pandemic had contributed to a torrid six months financially for aged care providers. The overall net deficit in Covid-related expenses was $196,000 per provider for the six months from July to December last year, the report found. It found more than 60% of residential aged care homes were currently operating at a loss. The Aged & Community Services Australia chief executive, Paul Sadler, said the current funding system was creating a “perverse incentive” that rewarded providers who experienced an outbreak. The loss of the early-stage temporary funding for Covid prevention, he said, had contributed to the dire financial situation of many providers. “Basically, we’re spending more money on trying to prevent Covid getting in than we’re getting back from the government, even if you’ve been able to get money back through the grants program,” Sadler said. “What we’ve been asking for through the [Australian Aged Care Collaboration], we talked about a workforce supplement being our first ask, so it’s short-term funding relief, and we included in that ask a request for a reinstatement of the Covid prevention component to the funding.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The most recent data paints a bleak picture of the ongoing impact of Covid in aged care, particularly in the early stages of 2022. The sector had reported 1,418 Covid deaths this year, already more than the two first years of the pandemic combined. There were 761 active outbreaks. About 3,300 aged care residents and 1,999 staff were Covid-positive in the last data released by the government. The United Workers Union said its members would strike in South Australia and Queensland on Friday, one day before the federal election, walking off the job over unfair pay and conditions. The major parties go to polling day with significant differences in their aged care policies, but the sector says neither has announced enough to address the immediate problems it faces. Labor has promised registered nurses will be on site 24/7 in every residential aged care facility in the country. It will also mandate that every resident receives an average of 215 minutes of care a day, as recommended by the aged care royal commission. Both parties have supported aged care workers’ case for a 25% pay rise, but only Labor has promised to fund it. The Coalition had made a string of commitments since the damning royal commission. It announced a five-year $19.1bn aged care plan, which included a major boost to home care of 40,000 new home care packages. The plan also included a boost to respite services, 7,000 new personal care workers, and 48,000 new training places. Labor said it would match that expenditure. The Coalition was also delivering bonuses of up to $800 for aged care staff and was spending $345m to embed pharmacy services in aged care facilities. The aged care sector said the successful booster rollout – which had seen high rates of triple-vaccinated residents, and was now delivering fourth doses – had helped protect residents. Anti-virals had also been distributed to aged care providers, which had helped treat positive Covid cases, Sadler said.

But Sadler said the day-to-day use of PPE, which posed a significant cost for providers, was no longer reimbursed. “That’s where originally this funding that they had in 2020-21 helped providers offset those costs against that additional government funding,” he said. “Now, there’s no additional funding.”",News/Australia news,Aged care sector wants Covid prevention funding restored as 30% of homes grapple with outbreaks ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/aged-care-sector-wants-covid-prevention-funding-restored-as-30-of-homes-grapple-with-outbreaks
5/20/2022,"Labor will establish an independent environment protection agency to enforce national conservation laws and collect data on the plight of the country’s wildlife if it wins the election. An Albanese government would also promise to give an annual ministerial statement on Australia’s role in international negotiations on environmental issues, suggesting it would look to play a leadership role at global biodiversity talks and on issues such as whale protection. The opposition environment spokesperson, Terri Butler, said the environment was in crisis and a Labor government would “restore trust and confidence in environmental decision-making”. She said Labor would establish a national EPA with two divisions – one responsible for compliance assurance and enforcement, and the other for environmental data, information and analysis. The data division would aim to address widely acknowledged concerns that not enough is known about the plight of Australia’s environment, including threatened species and ecosystems. Multiple official reports have found environmental protection has been held back by major gaps in information and monitoring. Butler said the establishment of an EPA would “restore trust and confidence” in decisions affecting the environment. “This is a really important step to improving decision making, with better data and an independent compliance division,” she said. The commitment on an EPA follows a major review of environment laws headed by the former competition watchdog head, Graeme Samuel, last year which called for the creation of an office with independent oversight of environmental compliance and a “custodian” responsible for providing reliable data. Environment groups have also called for an independent environmental regulator, and Labor took a similar promise to the 2019 election. Labor has promised it will make a full response to the Samuel review, which found consecutive governments had failed to arrest the decline of Australia’s unique plants and animals. The Morrison government did not provide a full response to the review in the last term of parliament and has rejected calls for an independent EPA. The opposition said it would consult on an EPA funding model in government, and it was likely to include contributions from sectors subject to environmental compliance. It said it would continue to work with groups and experts that were consulted as part of the Samuel review to try to achieve “durable reform” and laws that “work better for everyone”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor has promised to support a global target to protect 30% of land and 30% of sea areas by 2030, backed last year by the Morrison government as part of international biodiversity negotiations, and to take a leadership role in talks over agreements on the high seas and on marine garbage and microplastics. Butler said Labor would work with state and territory governments on world heritage issues, including pursuing world heritage listing of Murujuga in northern Western Australia and the Flinders Ranges, and expanding world heritage protections for the Cape York Peninsula and West Kimberley. She said a Labor government would look to add cultural and Indigenous heritage values as part of world heritage and national heritage listed areas, including the Daintree, and would deliver $276m that had been promised, but not fully delivered, for the Kakadu national park. The Australian Conservation Foundation welcomed the commitment to establish an independent EPA. The chief executive, Kelly O’Shanassy, said Samuel’s landmark report warned national environmental laws were outdated and ineffective. “For too long these laws have not been properly enforced, and ACF has long argued that we need a well-resourced independent regulator,” she said. “The EPA’s proposed data custodian role would also help to address the deficiencies identified by Prof Samuel and ensure that decision-makers, business and the community have access to the best available data, information and science.” O’Shanassy said the commitment to international leadership was welcome ahead of international negotiations for a new global deal for nature. WWF-Australia also welcomed the commitment to an EPA, but stressed its independence needed to be enshrined in law. “We would certainly stress it needs to be a statutory independent agency,” WWF’s head of policy, Quinton Clements, said. Clements said he hoped that in addition to committing to global biodiversity targets, a Labor government would sign a leaders’ pledge for nature that had already been endorsed by more than 90 countries. The Greens last week declared the decline of the country’s wildlife “one of the greatest failings in our nation’s history”, and said they would push for a target of zero extinctions by 2030 and the introduction of an independent environmental regulator.

5/20/2022,"Chinese Australian community leaders are warning the Coalition’s use of hardline rhetoric against China is turning voters off – and that it could potentially cost the government in Bennelong. The electorate in Sydney’s north-west has a sizeable Chinese Australian population and internal Labor polling suggests it could be winnable even though it’s held by the retiring MP John Alexander with a 6.9% margin. Felix Lo, the president of the Australian Asian Association of Bennelong, said the Chinese Australian community was afraid anti-Asian attacks could intensify if the political rhetoric did not soften. Lo highlighted comments from the defence minister, Peter Dutton, in April, when he said the only way to “preserve peace is to prepare for war”. Dutton said China was “on a very deliberate course at the moment”. “The only way you can preserve peace is to prepare for war and be strong as a country – not to be on bended knee and be weak,” the defence minister said. Lo said such comments could stoke hatred of the local Chinese community and he argued the Coalition was fearmongering during an election. “They have been using us, and I think it might backfire. I don’t think our government needs to be so aggressive in their tone and how they say things. Like talking about war as though it is coming tomorrow – that is totally crazy,” he said. “The language used has an effect on the community. People are genuinely afraid that anti-Asian attacks will intensify in Sydney. “Many are switching their votes from Liberal to Labor, and this is the main reason. Most Chinese Australians are business owners and for them to switch parties will come down to their wellbeing. “I know a lot of Liberal supporters are thinking of switching to Labor and it comes down to the anti-Chinese sentiment that is filtering down from the government.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor has been targeting Bennelong with internal polling suggesting 57% of residents in the electorate disapprove of Morrison’s performance as prime minister. A survey by the Lowy Institute released in April showed that one in three Chinese Australians had suffered discrimination due to their heritage. Almost 20% of those polled said they had been physically threatened or attacked because of their heritage while one in four had been called offensive names. The Eastwood Chinese Senior Citizens Club president, Hugh Lee, echoed Lo’s sentiments. He said many community members would switch their vote in 2022 based on the Coalition’s foreign policy. “For the past few elections, most of us supported the Liberals, because we believed they would do a better job in managing the economy,” Lee said. “But this time, I think a majority of us will make a switch to Labor because of the foreign and defence policy of the current government.” Lee said members of his community had been abused in public for speaking Cantonese and he argued the government’s language was fuelling anti-Asian hate. “Some of us have experienced signs of Asian hate, such as being abused by locals for speaking Cantonese; we are asked to only speak English.” Lee noted China was Australia’s biggest trading partner and he said the federal government’s hawkish stance had negatively affected the economy. “We think that if we can deal with our trading partners [better], no matter if it is China or Europe, our biggest trading partner will help our economy. So if we maintain a better relationship with them, it will help. “Instead of spending taxpayer money buying nuclear submarines from America, Australia should seek to build a better relationship with China.” In September, the Coalition announced an Aukus defence pact with the US and the UK, including the purchase of nuclear submarines. The decision to tear up a $90bn contract to buy conventional submarines from France’s Naval Group at a cost of up to $5.5bn prompted concerns of a capability gap with Collins-class submarines to be in use until 2050. Another community leader, who is a member of the Liberal party and the Chinese Australian Forum, said the fear of racial vilification was high with some people receiving death threats. “It’s actually pretty bad, it is seriously bad, there is fear in the community, especially after the last council elections, where some Chinese Australian candidates were abused and attacked, some receiving death threats,” he said. The community leader, who had previously campaigned for Alexander, said the language used by the Coalition did not effectively distinguish the Chinese Communist party from Chinese Australians. “Every time they attack China, they don’t say Chinese Australians have made a great contribution to Australia, they don’t clarify that they are attacking the CCP and not the community here. “It means many people see us as representing the CCP and China in Australia.” Last Friday, when campaigning in the Victorian seat of Chisholm, Scott Morrison was asked whether the government might suffer a backlash in electorates with significant Chinese Australian populations including Bennelong. The prime minister said he was “always very careful to make this distinction” between the government and people of China. “I talk about the assertive and aggressive nature of the Chinese government, not the Chinese people. You know, Chinese Australians are the greatest patriots you could hope for in this country,” he said.

5/20/2022,"National disability insurance scheme participants are spending months longer than needed in hospital as they await funding packages from the agency that runs the scheme, a new report shows. The report, from the Summer Foundation and La Trobe University, suggested that, while for many people this period was between one and three months, there was “substantial variation with some people spending months (up to two years) unnecessarily in hospital”. Overall, government data showed there were 1,140 participants stuck in hospital waiting for housing funding or other support before they can be released. And the Summer Foundation said more than 50 young people with disability were moved into aged care each month because they were waiting for NDIS funding for appropriate housing. The new report used hospital data looking at the files of 368 people to determine the number of “unnecessary bed days” they had experienced, as well the primary reason they were unable to be discharged. While there has been an improvement in the data since 2016, the report still found the median number of “unnecessary bed days” in 2020 was 65, or more than two months. That was essentially steady from 2019, but down from 93 days in 2016. No more current data was available. The report calculated the number of “unnecessary bed days” by looking at the date the patient was clinically ready for discharge, compared to when they actually left hospital. Leila Boahene, 63, suffered a stroke in April last year and now uses a wheelchair to get around. Her sister Helen Milovanovic said the whole process of acquiring an NDIS package for Boahene while she was in hospital had been a nightmare. The NDIS plan did not come through until December, with Boahene stuck in hospital and then a rehabilitation centre for many months, despite the fact she could have otherwise been discharged without the appropriate support in the middle of last year. “Mid April to December is the time it took to prepare an application, get all of the necessary evaluations, send it off to the NDIS, repackage [the application], resubmit and get a decision,” Milovanovic said. Milovanovic said the family lodged its initial NDIS application in July but it had been initially been rejected. This meant had needed to provide additional information, prolonging the process. Despite now having funding for supported disability accommodation, Boahene had been unable to secure suitable disability accommodation, meaning she was currently stuck in an aged care facility. Boahene said the staff at the hospital and rehab centre had been great, but the delays were “long and painful” and the environment had been grim. “I’m hoping to be more independent, which I am going to be,” she said. “The doctors said I won’t walk again. But I’m going to prove them wrong.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The Summer Foundation and La Trobe University report found more than a third (34.5%) of all patients in the study experienced a delay to being discharged. It said the most common reasons for discharge delays were NDIS planning-related delays (33%), sourcing a suitable discharge destination (25%), and arranging support on discharge (16%). The report recommended that hospitals implement “early alert systems for people who are either NDIS participants or likely to be eligible for the NDIS”. But it noted that “irrespective of how efficiently hospitals manage discharge planning, people will continue to face lengthy delays and discharge to aged care if funding decisions are not made quickly and appropriately”. “Funding should be provided quickly and flexibly to support the timely discharge back into the community rather than taking many months, leaving people with disability spending unnecessary time in hospital which, aside from the social costs, places pressure on already stretched health systems,” the report said. State governments have argued that delays to the discharge of hospital patients due to issues with the aged care and NDIS system are placing further strain on state health systems. The report also found that 71% of participants in a separate survey had experienced difficulties in securing housing for NDIS participants once their funding package was approved. In her sister’s case, Milovanovic said she’d been in touch with a number of housing providers, but had found the process slow and confusing. The family believed it had now found an appropriate home for Boahene, but the process could take another six to eight weeks before she was able to move into her own home. Her son, AJ, agreed the process of obtaining an NDIS package and then suitable disability accommodation had been frustrating. “It feels like one step forward, five steps back,” he said. “It’s been like that for nearly 12 months. We just want it to end, and get mum settled, so she can get on the rest of her life.” An NDIA spokesperson said “ensuring the safe and timely discharge of NDIS participants who are medically ready is a priority for the NDIA”. “However it’s important to note the drivers of hospital discharge delay are complex and may involve a range of issues outside of the NDIS. The NDIA and state and territory governments are each responsible for certain policy and operational solutions,” the spokesperson said. “For example, NDIS participants awaiting discharge may need access to a range of state government delivered services, including rehabilitation, housing and homelessness services, transport, mental health and justice support.” The spokesperson said the agency had a range of initiative to improve the hospital discharge process.",News/Australia news,"Funding delays keep NDIS participants in hospital months longer than necessary, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/funding-delays-keep-ndis-participants-in-hospital-months-longer-than-necessary-report-finds
5/20/2022,"I’m tired of accepting the majority of the domestic load just because I’m technically better at it. My husband is a wonderful human, a great father and a generous and loving partner. But ever since I’ve known him, he has been almost inept at anything domestic in nature, be it chores around the home or managing life in a partnership with a family of his own. It all falls on me, and I’m tired not only from the physical load, but the mental load too. It’s this part that people talk less of – holding the knowledge and remembering, planning, executing all the things that are needed to run a household successfully. I feel like the reason I, like many women I’m sure, carry this load is because we’ve let our men get away with the perception that “we know how” to do it better and therefore it’s easier that we take on the responsibility. My husband will only do things like chores or organising of household needs when prompted and guided. How do I have a conversation with him without seeming petty? I really want the share to be completely equal, 50/50, because I’m drowning in the idea that this will be my burden for the rest of my life. With two kids under three, I’m feeling this pressure and dread more than I ever have. Eleanor says: It’s well documented that women often do more of the thinking around the domestic work as well as more of the work itself. Knowing what the supplies are, what needs to be cleaned, learning what’s involved in doing something well – it’s a significant amount of work, and the fact that it gets done can mean it also self-erases. I’ve written before that housework wipes up after itself, such that the people who don’t do it can forget that anyone does – as though pantries naturally stay well-stocked or the bottom of the fridge stays clean on its own. You asked how to have a helpful conversation about this. That depends on whether this is a problem of ignorance or motivation. If it’s ignorance – if he believes you already split the work 50/50 – perhaps all you need to do is correct that. It can help to let someone experience not knowing something instead of just telling them they don’t. You could try keeping records: spend a few weeks noting who does what, who remembers, who plans, taking care not to skew things or be too resentful, and then ask his impressions of how you split the work. “How much time do you think I spent this week on household management?” is a question with a concrete answer, and it could stop you reaching for the easily falsifiable things we sometimes say in confrontation like “you never” and “I always”. If, however, it’s a problem of motivation, that is a little more complicated. I had a housemate once who’d leave last night’s roast chicken carcass in the sink – “Can you clean up food the same day you cook it?” “No thanks”. It’s oddly dumbfounding when people just disagree about what’s fair. So if your husband agrees you do more work but denies that’s reason to change, perhaps you’d have more success asking in the key of kindness, than in the key of fairness. When you say “it’s unfair that I do all this”, he might think “I disagree” or “I didn’t ask you to”, but it’s a lot harder to flatly reject you if you say something like “this would make my life a lot more pleasant and I’m asking for your help”. And two tactical notes: I’d try to make this conversation as specific as possible so you only have to have it once. It’s no good spending a lot of emotional energy securing the abstract agreement that he could do more, only to find in two weeks that you thought that meant help planning and he thought it meant help gardening. That’ll just make his efforts feel unacknowledged and your needs feel unmet. Name the things you want help with and mutually agree whether that works – small-scale specifics are the site of lasting change. Finally, I’d take some time to figure out whether you want this conversation to correct the future or to air resentment about the past. Either is a fine goal, but decide on one and commit to it: conversations curdle quickly when one person can detect anger the other’s pretending not to have. Households and relationships have to be mutual – the work of maintaining them should be, too. Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

5/20/2022,"In the three years since the last federal election, Australia has experienced its worst bushfire season, a succession of catastrophic floods, and ongoing drought. That, combined with the high-profile campaigns of the so-called teal independents, has brought the climate crisis into sharper electoral focus. It has also put the Australian Greens in position to gain up to three seats in the Senate, with a potential, though unlikely, addition of another lower house seat in Brisbane. This could happen despite the Greens receiving less media attention than in previous years, with the battle for inner-city seats in Melbourne and Sydney dominated by independent candidates – who have also been fielding the majority of questions on how they would respond to a hung parliament. The party leader, Adam Bandt, has spent much of the five-week campaign in Queensland, where the party hopes to pick up a Senate seat and make ground in the seats of Griffith, Brisbane and Ryan. They overlap areas held by the Greens at a state level. The party also hopes to pick up a second Senate seat in New South Wales, where the state MP David Shoebridge is the lead candidate, and South Australia, where the sixth Senate spot will go to either the Greens, the Centre Alliance or Nick Xenophon. If the Greens manage to pick up all three Senate spots it will bring their number on the Senate crossbench to 12. With Bandt in the lower house, that would make for the largest ever Greens party room. “Everyone is taking published election polling with a grain of salt at the moment, particularly given the results in the last election, but on current trends we’re on track to be in the balance of power in the Senate, potentially in our own right,” Bandt says. “With a minority parliament looking increasingly more likely we may be in the balance of power in the lower house as well.” Rather than sucking oxygen out of the Greens campaign, Bandt says, the campaigns of high-profile independent candidates have increased attention on core Greens issues. “All of the people who are looking for an independent in the lower house will find the Greens to be the logical choice in the Senate, we hope,” he says. “On the whole it’s helped put climate on the agenda and helped show up the terrible climate policies of Liberal and Labor.” With the exception of Kooyong, where the Greens polled second behind the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in 2019 thanks to a high-profile candidate in the barrister Julian Burnside, the Greens have not targeted any seat where there is a pro-climate action independent. They are preferencing independent candidates in those seats and Labor across the rest of the country. The former leader of the party, Christine Milne, says it has been “the best election for the Greens since 2010”. “That was an election in which climate change was a major issue … Climate has not resonated with the community again until this election, but I really think it’s there now. That’s why the Greens are hopeful of ending out with the biggest party room they’ve ever had and I really hope it comes to pass.” Polling for the Greens has varied from 15% in a poll conducted by Resolve Strategic for the Nine newspapers at the start of May to 9% in Wednesday’s Guardian Essential poll. In the 2019 election, their vote share was 10%. Kevin Bonham, a psephologist, says the stronger vote is likely to be a result of Labor dialling down its climate policies than any new campaign strategy of the Greens. “I don’t think the Greens are doing anything new or different. I think their campaigns have been the same for some time,” he says. Bonham says that while the polls may overstate Greens support, the party has a reasonable chance of picking up additional Senate seats, although South Australia was less likely. A gain is less likely in the lower house, he says, particularly if there is a swing toward Labor in the seats where Greens also do well. Failure to gain any Senate seats or increase the party’s primary vote in targeted seats will be a sign that the campaign needs to change, says associate Prof Kate Crowley, an academic at the University of Tasmania who has written extensively on the Greens as partners in minority government. Crowley suggests the party may need to be less ideological and position itself not as a party of the left but a party of environmental and climate action, issues she says are bipartisan. “If the teal independents are more successful [than] the Greens, then that just shows you that there are environmentally conscious people on the right that are waiting to be tapped on the shoulder that the Greens have been neglecting,” she says. Bandt is unapologetically of the left. He has repeatedly said the Greens would not guarantee supply to a Coalition government, no matter its leader, saying: “I want this government gone.” At a campaign launch in Brisbane this week he announced a shortlist of demands that the Greens would have in the event of a Labor minority government. That includes a ban on any new coal or gas developments, which Labor has ruled out. The oil and gas industry has already begun counter-lobbying. Bandt says it would be the “toughest area of discussion”, but one that the International Energy Agency has said is necessary to keep global heating within safe limits. “At some point we’re going to have to stop opening new coal and gas projects and it’ll only be the Greens who push for that,” Bandt says. “I think it will be very difficult for the next government, especially if they want to host a global climate summit in Australia, to continue to back new coal and gas projects. They will be hounded by the rest of the world if they’re pouring petrol on the fire while everyone else is trying to put the fire out.” The list also includes adding dental care to Medicare, which builds on reforms secured by Bandt in the hung parliament after the 2010 election that covered dental care for children. Also on the list are raising the jobseeker rate, free childcare and progress on “all elements” of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, which Labor has already committed to. The Greens have run a significant number of First Nations candidates, including an all-First Nations Senate ticket in Victoria and their lead Senate candidate in the ACT, Dr Tjanara Goreng Goreng. Both Labor and the Coalition have said they will not enter into a power-sharing arrangement with crossbench MPs in the event of a minority government. Milne has been a member of three minority governments in Tasmania and at the federal level. Only once, in Tasmania in 1996, did Labor choose to remain in opposition rather than strike a deal with the Greens. “It is incredibly frustrating to watch this charade every time,” she says. If no party wins an overall majority on Saturday, Milne says, it will be a good thing for the country and the planet. “There will be meaningful action on climate change if there’s a minority government with Greens and others in the balance of power.”",News/Australia news,Australian Greens hope election focus on climate will bring their biggest ever representation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/australian-greens-hope-election-focus-on-climate-will-bring-their-biggest-ever-representation
5/20/2022,"It’s been almost a week since prime minister Scott Morrison conceded he was a “bit of a bulldozer” and vowed to change the way he behaved if re-elected. But for voters in the marginal seat of Higgins, in Melbourne’s inner east, it’s too little too late. Alison Baker says Morrison “lacks any integrity or accountability”, citing the sports rorts scandal, his handling of Covid-19 and the sizeable debt in the budget borrowed before the start of the pandemic. “As soon as the pandemic hit, I thought: here we go, he’s gonna blame it all on the pandemic. But he was in deep shit – to put it bluntly – before then,” she says. Baker owns a corner shop across the road from Prahran Market, where she sells fresh bread, pastries and sandwiches. This election, she’s placed a sign for Labor’s candidate for Higgins, Dr Michelle Ananda-Rajah, in her store window along with the quote, “compassion is back in fashion”. “We live in a society not an economy. So yes, I’m a business owner but my concerns are more broadly for society,” she says. “I’m really, really worried what will happen to the country if it’s three more years of this.” About 2km away, at a cafe on the intersection of High Street and the tree-lined Grandview Grove in Prahran, Simone White and Tam, who live in Malvern, are discussing the election when we approach them. “Like he said in his own words, he’s a bulldozer. He’s a bully. That’s how I see him,” White says of Morrison. Tam, who did not want her surname published, says it is “impossible to forgive” Morrison for mismanaging the vaccine rollout and failing to support Victorians, who have endured several Covid-19 lockdowns. “I saw the premier [Daniel Andrews] say recently that it seemed like the Liberal party thought that they were having a potshot at the Labor party, but they weren’t, they were having a go at Victorians and he’s right,” she said. “I took it personally. It has definitely swayed my vote.” Both women say they come from families that have traditionally voted for the Liberals but say they can’t support the party at this election. White says she’ll back either Labor or the Greens, while Tam says she’s voting for the Greens – she wants the minor party to hold the balance of power in the lower house. “Yes, we’re disillusioned but there is also disillusionment among staunch Liberal voters because of the rightwing sort of thing that’s happening in the party. I see a lot of older people saying that it’s not the party they recognise,” she says. It’s these voters that have Labor strategists convinced it can win Higgins, which stretches from South Yarra in the west to Ashburton and Murrumbeena in the east, taking in the suburbs of Toorak and Malvern. After Liberal MP Kelly O’Dwyer retired in 2019, the seat became a three-way contest between the Liberals, the Greens and Labor. Dr Katie Allen managed to retain the seat for the Liberals but her margin slipped to just 3.9%. Following a redistribution ahead of this election, in which Higgins lost part of Glen Iris and all of Hughesdale but gained Windsor, her margin has shrunk further, to 2.6%. In a sign of how close the contest is, the candidates arrived early on Wednesday morning to the prepoll station at St George’s Anglican Church in Malvern and planned to stay there for much of the day. The Greens’ candidate, Sonya Semmens, says the redistribution has worked in her party’s favour. Windsor records the highest Greens vote in the state seat of Prahran, which has been held by the Greens since 2014, at 40%, while about half the people who live in the suburb are renters. Semmens says she understands the current rental crisis from her own personal experience of it. After her marriage ended in 2016, Sonya rented for a few months before being evicted by the landlord, who wanted to renovate. She and her two children were homeless for period of three months after about a dozen rental applications were rejected. “My kids have had 10 homes in the last six-and-a-half years. That’s housing, not a home and it’s depressing. When I was a kid, I lived in the same house for 21 years,” Semmens says, before spruiking the Greens’ policy to strengthen renters’ rights and fund tenancy advocacy services. As for Labor, despite vowing to focus on traditional mortgage-belt seats such as Chisholm after the 2019 loss, the party is again pulling out all the stops in Higgins: an avalanche of election material, targeted social media advertising and guest appearances by the former prime minister Kevin Rudd and Labor frontbenchers Penny Wong, Tanya Plibersek and Claire O’Neil. Labor candidate Michelle Ananda-Rajah describes the people of the electorate as “self-made or on well on their way”. “A lot of people have reached a certain point in material wealth where they are thinking about other issues which have been neglected, they want action on things,” she says. Ananda-Raja cites climate change, intergenerational inequality and the need for a federal integrity commission are the main issues people raise with her, as well as their dislike for Morrison. “What they have in Scott is a person with no legacy and no agenda for the future and that’s pretty evident. And, they’re sick of the sloganeering,” she says. “It explains why he hasn’t showed up here for more than 100 days. But you know, I’d love him to come down here. I’d be delighted.” Allen concedes Morrison is unpopular among some constituents. She, however, is anything but. Dozens of people recognise her at the prepoll voting booth and approach her to tell her she has their vote. She even offers to look after Coco Pops, a voter’s dog, while the owner goes to vote for her. “People say to me, we love what you’re doing and some people are not so happy with the position of the party and they say that to me,” Allen says. “But they also understand that the party is a broad church and they like the fact that I stand up for my values and I hold firm on them. And they can see how hard I’ve worked through Covid to answer every email, every phone call.” Allen disagrees with Morrison’s description of himself as a “bulldozer”. She says he needed to be able to make tough decisions during the pandemic. Tim McCarthy, a “lifelong Liberal voter” agrees. He lives in an aged care facility in Malvern and voted early to ensure Morrison “got [his] vote”. “I was worried I was going to have a fall or something and couldn’t make it out on election day. I’m not joking!” he says. McCarthy says Morrison got the country through Covid-19 and there was no need for change. “He’s done a good job. You can only go by the figures: we’ve come out on top after Covid-19, we’re one of the best economies in the world. What more can you ask for? “I mean, I would like a nice female friend but what politician can help with that?”",News/Australia news,Too little too late: voters turn on Morrison in affluent seat of Higgins,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/federal-electorate-seat-higgins-too-little-too-late-voters-turn-on-morrison-in-affluent-melbourne-seat-2022-australian-election
5/20/2022,"A Labor government will make use of Australia’s existing laws to deport visa holders who are convicted of crimes, but is expected to tweak the rules to ease strain on the relationship with New Zealand. Labor has been ambiguous about whether it would reintroduce a stalled Coalition bill to “strengthen” the character test – legislation that the opposition had regarded as a political wedge by the Morrison government. Labor supported the bill in the lower house in February and had been planning to move several amendments in the Senate, but that legislation never made it to a vote in the upper house before the election was called. Guardian Australia understands a Labor government would continue deportations under section 501 of the Migration Act as currently in force, but would be likely to adjust the ministerial direction to ensure decisions better take into account the time a person has been in Australia. The proposal would aim to address the disproportionate impact of the policy on citizens from New Zealand, which has long argued it is “corrosive” to the relationship to deport people who have lived most of their lives in Australia. New Zealand’s foreign minister, Nanaia Mahuta, said in February the country was “concerned that Australia continues to send people to New Zealand who have never lived here and have no family or support networks at all”. The potential changes to the ministerial direction envisaged by the Labor party would not require legislation to go through parliament. Labor is supportive of a recommendation by the Liberal-chaired joint standing committee on migration in 2019 that the historic special immigration status of New Zealand citizens be considered as a factor in visa cancellations. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, confirmed on Thursday that he would use the existing laws – but hinted that he would also seek to improve the trans-Tasman relationship. “Section 501 applies for breaches of people who are on visas, and if people commit serious offences then action should be taken in Australia’s national interests,” Albanese told reporters in the Sydney seat of Bennelong. “Jacinda Ardern is someone who I’ve met with here in Australia and also in Wellington and in Auckland. I think she is an outstanding prime minister and I’m sure that we would have a very warm and cordial relationship.” The long-simmering row between close partners Australia and New Zealand stems from the use of section 501 of Australia’s Migration Act, which allows the cancellation of visas on character grounds, and which is most likely to be used against New Zealand nationals. The number of cancellations under the policy has increased nearly tenfold in under a decade, largely as a result of the Australian government tightening the law to say the minister must revoke the visa if a person has been sentenced to 12 months or more in prison. In 2020-21, 946 visas were cancelled under section 501, most commonly for drug offences. New Zealand was the most common nationality for character cancellations over the last 12 months, followed by the UK. The issue has not figured heavily during the election campaign, although the Coalition has promised to “take a hardline stance against non-citizen criminals by cancelling or refusing the visas of those who commit serious crimes, and strengthening the grounds for doing so”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, continued to face questions on Thursday about his approach to foreign policy challenges, including the fallout from the new security deal between China and Solomon Islands. The winner of Saturday’s election is expected to travel to Tokyo early next week for a Quad summit of the leaders of Australia, Japan, the US and India. Morrison said he would like to visit Pacific island countries including Solomon Islands soon. “It would be my intention, not only to visit there, but many of the other Pacific countries that I had hoped to visit during the last three years which Covid prevented me from visiting,” Morrison said in the Tasmanian seat of Lyons. He also nominated Vietnam as a country he would like to visit in the near future if re-elected. At a later media conference in the NSW seat of Werriwa, Morrison blocked a reporter’s question to his immigration minister, Alex Hawke, about whether he would exercise his powers to allow the Murugappan family to return to the Queensland town of Biloela. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison answered the question for Hawke, replying that the matter was yet to be determined by the courts. “There has been no finding of protection for that family,” the prime minister said. “They have not been found to be refugees.” Labor has pledged to allow the family to return to Biloela if it wins the election. The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, has also expressed his support for the family.",News/Australia news,Labor would deport visa holders convicted of crimes but tweak rules to ease New Zealand tensions,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/labor-would-deport-visa-holders-convicted-of-crimes-but-tweak-rules-to-ease-new-zealand-tensions
5/20/2022,"In the opening pages of Heartland, author Jennifer Pinkerton admits to feeling a little superior because she’s never used online dating. As a Gen Xer, she’s a few years older than me, and I’ve never not dated online. In her book, Pinkerton has set out to investigate “which avenue – high-tech or low-tech – results in better sex and relationships, and whether that’s even the right question to ask”. Over a six-year period, she interviewed a range of subjects across Australia, from academics to active daters, to approach something of an answer. There’s a lot of ground to cover, and Heartland attempts to tackle it all: dating apps, alcohol reliance, hookup culture, the prevalence of “chill”, travel, porn, kink, non-monogamy, climate change, Covid-19. Many of these topics could make for a book-length investigation on their own; an overview, such as Pinkerton provides, raises interesting questions, but can only really skim the surface in a way that, in this case, rarely results in satisfying answers. Formally, Heartland bears similarities to Lucia Osborne-Crowley’s My Body Keeps Your Secrets and Monica Tan’s Stranger Country – part travelogue, part anthropological study, part memoir. Pinkerton weaves her personal narrative through a tapestry of other voices to tell a much broader story. Her lyrical and evocative style shines brightest when she is describing the landscape of the Northern Territory, where much of the book is set, and vivid characters emerge through compelling dialogue. At times, though, the florid aspects of Pinkerton’s writing serve as smoke and mirrors, obscuring the fact that, actually, not much is being said. Pinkerton approaches many of her interviewees with an open, curious mind. She immerses herself in her subjects’ lives, from twentysomething women gossiping about their love lives over wine, to Indigenous sistagirls. But there’s a sense, always, that she’s an outsider looking in, and one who is often out of her depth. (I’m reminded of my mother, who asks me often if I’m still on “Tindler”.) There’s also a nagging air of conservatism throughout Heartland: though Pinkerton recognises the paradoxes and contradictions of the modern dating landscape, such as a concurrent desire for commitment and freedom, it seems difficult for her to grasp that not all people want traditional, heteronormative relationships. At one point she writes of people who “fling open their inboxes and their legs, yet close the door on expressions of honesty and vulnerability”. Intentional or not, the judgment inherent in that sentence makes its way into much of the book; even though Pinkerton acknowledges gendered double standards and reflects on her biases, she never quite shakes them off. Pinkerton has made a clear effort to be inclusive in her research by speaking to people from a range of different groups, but there’s a distinct feeling of otherness in the way she discusses race in particular. Microaggressions pepper the text, such as when she earnestly asks a friend: “Tell me about being coloured in the dating world … does it make things harder or easier?” She also has a tendency to specify race when it is not relevant – for instance, repeatedly referring to the fact that a porn-obsessed ex of hers was Nigerian – and quotes a number of people who use racial slurs or perpetuate racist stereotypes. While these are their views and not hers, the replication of these sentiments makes for an uncomfortable reading experience, a reminder to the reader that whiteness is the default here. Where Heartland does succeed is in communicating many of the anxieties faced by young people today – for instance, climate and environment – and how these have led to a prevalent desire to connect with others who share the same priorities. In this way, this is a book that speaks directly to the moment, and the ways in which interpersonal relationships reflect the shifting values and beliefs of the modern world. Love is like that – an evolving, amorphous entity, showing who we are and who we want to be, both individually and together.

5/20/2022,"As a rule, politicians in Australia love sport. And they have no qualms using sport for electoral ends. Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s suburban dad persona is underpinned by his support of NRL team, the Cronulla Sharks. He is their number one ticket-holder and frequently pictured in Sharks apparel, even if some question the authenticity of his fandom. Morrison thrives in sporting environments – running bottles for the Wallabies, enjoying a fast lap at the Bathurst 1000 and joining the commentary box at the fourth Ashes test. His opponent, Anthony Albanese, is an even bigger rugby league fan – the opposition leader’s Twitter profile proudly notes his life-membership of the South Sydney Rabbitohs. It is not always easy to determine whether an individual politician’s sporting allegiances are genuine or strategic; Labor has condemned Morrison’s sporting image, claiming he “switched codes and switched teams”. But there is no doubting that sports funding is determined through a political lens. Indeed recent analysis from Guardian Australia found that the two major parties have pledged over $40m to sporting clubs that benefited from the sport rort program. And a website updated by sports researcher Greg Blood lists a staggering number of sporting promises made during this election: almost 100 from the Coalition (ranging from $200,000 for a refurbished basketball stadium in Canberra to $30m for an aquatic centre in Western Australia) and 87 at last count from Labor (including $500,000 for a skate park in Merimbula and $8m for a swimming pool in Kalgoorlie). All of which makes a mockery of that often-repeated claim that sport is not political. It also underscores the hypocrisy of Morrison’s message to Cricket Australia, after they dropped the label “Australia Day”, that the peak body should have “a bit more focus on cricket, and a bit less focus on politics.” But it also prompts the question: where are our sports stars in the political debate? Globally, athletes are increasingly using their profile and platform for the greater good (even if some remain happy to take money from brutal autocratic regimes).Yet as election day looms, Australian athletes are staying silent. Ironic, given that politicians are happy associating themselves with sport and pouring money into sporting infrastructure in the hope of winning votes. Even the campaign of Canberra’s Senate hopeful, former Wallabies captain David Pocock, has been short on celebrity sporting endorsements (although some have praised him on social media). The absence of political campaigning by athletes is all the more conspicuous given the current trend towards issue-based activism. The Cool Down, a movement led by Pocock’s partner, Emma, has recruited hundreds of Australian athletes to call for climate action. More than 260 AFL players came together to form advocacy group AFL Players for Climate Action. In January, the Professional Footballers Association announced support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart. Yet this activism has not translated into party-political advocacy. Given the significant differences between political parties on climate action, on Indigenous constitutional recognition, and other major social issues, this is perplexing. It is a short leap from calling for climate action to campaigning for the election of a party that takes the climate crisis seriously. But it is a leap Australia’s athletes have not taken (at least, not yet). Why? There are a few issues at play. Even if sport is inherently political, there are still many sports fan who avoid that reality. If we don’t want sport to be political, we don’t want our athletes to be political either. Collectively, we deny them political agency by compelling them to stay in their lane. The tabloid backlash is easily imaginable, the “stick to sport” headlines. Emma Pocock’s organisation, Frontrunners, admits as much on its website: “Athletes face real barriers to engaging with issues beyond sport”. Another factor is money. Athlete activism comes with commercial risk – players fear alienating sponsors, fans and clubs. NBA legend Michael Jordan famously quipped “Republicans buy sneakers, too.” One need only look to Colin Kaepernick, whose NFL career was effectively ended by his political advocacy, for a vivid example of the potential consequences. Given many high performance sports, and athletes are effectively bankrolled by the federal government, political activism comes with heightened risk. “They are worried about biting the hand the feeds them,” one observer told me. The same is true for sporting administrators. Both the Coalition and Labor are enthusiastic patrons of sport – through high-performance funding, support for major tournaments and community infrastructure. “It is plainly in the financial interests of sport to remain non-partisan,” a well-placed observer suggested. The treatment of sport as exceptional, and above politics, has gifted sports a privileged legal position – to the detriment of players, who in many cases lack the same rights as other Australian workers, while enriching sporting codes and club owners. In some cases it may be a strategic decision. I am aware of athletes who have declined requests to provide political endorsements, even in cases of ideological alignment, in a desire to preserve their neutrality. Perhaps athletes can be more politically effective if they remain impartial, able to engage with all sides of the debate. Athletes might be better placed to take their communitiesand fan-base on a journey of change by remaining non-partisan. This may be so. But their absence from the political playing field is conspicuous. On the eve of one of the most consequential federal elections in decades, Australia’s athletes are largely silent. Will that silence last?

5/20/2022,"“How good is Queensland?” The sunshine state delivered the Coalition a “miracle” in 2019, prompting Scott Morrison’s rhetorical praise. It also left progressive voters in other states plotting to excise Queensland from the commonwealth. For a while, in the middle of the pandemic, the Queensland border closed, and their wish came true. Despite Queensland’s conservative caricature – and the fact the Coalition has 23 of the 30 federal seats – the state is much more progressive than it is often characterised. So what does that mean for the 2022 election? Here are the five questions that should be answered on election day. In 2019, Queensland was a known battleground – home to a string of regional and suburban seats held by the Coalition on small margins, and the most likely route to government for Bill Shorten’s Labor. Many of those margins are no longer small. The big swings against Labor in 2019 mean the focus of this election will be elsewhere; those regional Queensland seats now only change hands in a landslide. Realistically, Labor needs two terms to regain its footing in places like Gladstone and Townsville. This time around, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, and opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, have spent much less time in regional Queensland. If anything, Queensland is conservative because voters up here don’t like to change governments. The state has a history of favouring incumbents. And Labor figures are cautious not to pin too many hopes that Queensland will be relevant to the overall election story. But still, there are electorates in play. The first two seats to fall in a swing to Labor are not necessarily the most marginal. Brisbane (4.9%) and Ryan (6%), inner-city seats held by moderate Liberals, are both likely to swing away from the Coalition over social issues and climate policy. The complicating factor is the Greens. At local and state elections in recent years, the Greens have significantly increased their vote in the city and inner-suburban areas covered by three federal electorates – Brisbane, Ryan and Griffith. Some polls have put the Greens’ statewide vote in Queensland at the highest level in the country: up to 18%. The mathematics are simple in Brisbane and Ryan – if the Liberal National party primary vote is down (as polling predicts), the seat will likely fall to whichever of Labor or the Greens can record the most primary votes. Some polling has shown the Greens very close. The Green wave could also threaten Labor in Griffith, which is held by environment spokeswoman Terri Butler. Of the three inner-city seats, Griffith is the most progressive. But that also makes it harder for the Greens to win in a preferential contest where the LNP finishes third. While much of the wash-up in 2019 focused on regional Queensland, outer suburban Brisbane also hosted marginal electorates that have shifted to safe LNP seats. Remember the clamour around Peter Dutton’s seat of Dickson, and the GetUp! campaign to unseat him? There’s been little such noise this time. Ditto in Petrie and Forde – seats that were tentative for the Coalition under Malcolm Turnbull but which have now become comfortable under Morrison. Longman, a bellwether wedged between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, fits the same mould. While it remains to be seen whether Labor can flip Longman (or any of the longer-shot suburban seats), these electorates will reveal the PM’s popularity with the voters he has cultivated as his core support. The Senate campaign in Queensland pits rightwing minor parties – mostly headed by LNP defectors – up against the LNP in a battle for a final seat. Polling suggests the Coalition will win two Senate seats, and Labor is also favoured to win two. The Greens are also polling strongly and the most likely to take the fifth spot. The remaining seat will be fought between Pauline Hanson, Campbell Newman, Clive Palmer and the Coalition’s assistant minister for women, Amanda Stoker. Each are pitching for a similar subset of voters: anti-mandate folks, Christian conservatives and climate change deniers, including those on the right who have grown disillusioned with the LNP. Stoker has been narrowcasting to Christian groups; Hanson retains strong personal support in some parts of Queensland but appears to have little money and a string of ghost candidates in lower house seats; Palmer has spent big (again) and has some momentum; and Newman remains a big personality in the state. In the middle of the election campaign, The Next Economy released a report – What Regions Need – that showed how some of the fraught, binary political conversations in regional Australia have changed in the past year. It showed that people in fossil fuel towns now accept the inevitability of an energy transition. In Flynn, which Labor rates an outside (but still narrow) chance, the party’s campaign has been buoyed by the state government’s aggressive renewable energy plans and hydrogen plans for Gladstone, and a more nuanced message about the need to diversify the local economy. So are the coal wars over? It remains to be seen. As the Guardian found while driving through Flynn, there is still scepticism in many communities, if not outright denialism. The Coalition’s net-zero commitment might also push some of these voters to minor parties. It’s unlikely that regional seats will change hands. The closest contest is in Leichhardt, which runs from Cairns to Cape York and the Torres Strait. It has been very wet, particularly in south-east Queensland. What on earth does the weather have to do with the election? A bit, actually. Flooding in March left 3,600 homes – most in the Brisbane area – uninhabitable. More than 4,400 more were damaged. In the fortnight before the election, it has rained heavily and barely stopped. Some voters have told us that this puts climate change at the front and centre of their considerations. For all the policy back-and-forth, voting is ultimately an emotional decision. A psychological study from 2017 that analysed decades of voting and weather data found that a positive shift in temperature on election day often resulted in a positive shift in votes for the incumbent party. Large numbers in south-east Queensland have voted at soaked and unseasonably humid prepoll booths. But if the sun makes an appearance on Saturday it might help turn the mood – even slightly – in electorates where voters are growing restless.",News/Australia news,The federal election questions soon to be resolved in Queensland,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/the-federal-election-questions-soon-to-be-resolved-in-queensland
5/20/2022,"Does our existence on a social media platform have the lifespan of a dog (10-13 years) or a person (72.6 years) or a palm tree (80 years)? I guess we don’t know because the end has not been written in the code, instead it’s something we feel in our bones – the time when it’s over. On Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram – platforms where many people have been for a decade or more – much of the user experience feels distinctly middle-aged right now. The design of these platforms is as familiar, comforting and loathsome to us as the interior of our own homes (this is boring! Don’t you dare change it!) and the invisible hand of the algorithm like a trick that no longer seems fresh but instead feels manipulative and is received with resentment and an eyeroll. Even the arguments on the platforms have the spite and stalemate of a toxic marriage. There’s the sense of having heard it all before, where everything is predictable and even your triggers, your rage, your disgust and your excitement feels reheated and tired. And then there’s you, your other self, the avatar that you drag through the timelines, shackled like a hungry ghost, that feels most tired of all. This was what I was thinking in April as soon as the Australian federal election was announced and my platform of choice, Twitter, devolved even further into abuse and partisanship. I deactivated my account for a month, but platformless, I felt adrift. That was when I started reading the emails I had been receiving weekly for years now (unable to unsubscribe), from the most unloved platform of all: LinkedIn. In its kind of catfishy way, the LinkedIn emails told me people had been looking at my profile. Some weeks it would be 60 people, some weeks it would be 47. LinkedIn told me people were looking at me, but didn’t provide identities or context. Did these people have the hots for me? Did they hate me? Did they want to hire me? Just who were these perverts??? Vanity piqued, in order to find out, I would need to become a “premium member” of the platform. ** On signing into LinkedIn, I see a number of names come up in the feed that I have not thought about since 2010, when I randomly joined the site, took a quick walk around the platform with its suburban office park vibes and its BIG LANYARD ENERGY, then never went back. LinkedIn is the land of weak ties – the hiring manager for a contract I did at Microsoft, an academic I once interviewed for a long-forgotten story, a colleague I did casual shifts with at the Telegraph in 2007. On LinkedIn I come across media identities, such as Leigh Sales, who have left Twitter because it’s too toxic. (Sales described the abuse on Twitter as “non-stop, personal, often vile, frequently unhinged and regularly based on fabrications.”) Labor MP Ed Husic has also become a beloved figure on LinkedIn after leaving Twitter in 2017 because it was a “bully pulpit”. I send connection requests to Ed and Leigh and decide to spend a week living a LinkedIn life. Maybe this could be my new home too? I follow everything that LinkedIn tells me to do, requests which are relentlessly positive and upbeat. I spend my days sending messages to my weak ties for their birthdays, work anniversaries and promotions. LinkedIn goes through my contacts (how, I do not know) and asks me to “connect” with them on the platform. Following the prompts, I send these people a message, saying “Let’s connect on LinkedIn”. When I run into these friends and colleagues in real life, they look worried and ask if I’ve been hacked. (“Why?” “Well, I received a LinkedIn request from you … ”) In the feed, I congratulate my contacts on a conference presentation or an initiative (I write “Brilliant initiative!” or “Great conference!”), a promotion (I send gifs suggested by LinkedIn), and most dystopian of all, if they have work anniversaries, I congratulate them on the day they were effectively born into a company. “Congratulations on 25 years!” I say to contacts who have surely greeted such a milestone with bewilderment and existential angst (who stays anywhere for that long?). When I get confident, I post my own message, or rather a question, on the public feed. This is time to engage with my contacts! Instead, days go by and no one comments on my post. LinkedIn tells me 174 people have seen my post (which reads “Hi – I am new to LinkedIn. Tell me why it’s good. XX”) and only one person eventually responds. I feel tense when I open the platform, and my post is still sitting there, unloved, stinking up the feed. Did I say something wrong? LinkedIn is making me feel like a loser. I think back fondly to my old platform. Yeah, Twitter may be a hellscape but at least it was my hellscape. Last month when I tweeted that a magpie walked into my house, I had 125 replies. I return to LinkedIn and check again. No more responses to my timid first post. SCREW THEM! Maybe I am suited to Twitter’s big evil energy after all. Maybe I have become one with the algorithm, and the quick hits of attention, drama and vitriol have been what’s sustained me for the last 13 years. On LinkedIn, as I scroll through dimly lit photos of people in suits in the conference rooms of five-star hotel ballrooms, of a beige tearoom and awkward people standing around a birthday cake from Michel’s Patisserie and yet another photo of someone with their team, receiving an ugly plaque, I am already contemplating my escape. Twitter was a war zone, but LinkedIn is like being in Singapore. My adrenals miss the rush. But as I log back on to the Hell Site, I pause for a moment. Linkedin took me into a world of yesteryear, where people are polite, where they congratulate you on your achievements, where the tone is encouraging and supportive. After 13 years of spending hours a day on the platform, it’s now obvious that Twitter has changed me for the worst, coarsening my sensibilities and priming me for conflict and aggression. We deserve each other.",Opinion/Opinion,I’m spending a week living a LinkedIn life.

5/20/2022,"Clive Palmer’s United Australia party is burning through its projected $70m election advertising spend, including hour-long television commercials, as a data analyst warns the fringe party could have more backing than polls predict, with some voters embarrassed to voice their support. At 9.45pm on Wednesday – hours before the blackout for election ads on broadcast media came into effect – Channel 10 ran an hour-long UAP ad which marketing analysts believe cost up to $600k but would have been discounted due to the mammoth ad spend by the party. It was the third time the UAP had paid for the hour-long ad, which ran on Channel 9 and 7flix in recent days. Billed as the UAP campaign launch that had happened weeks earlier, the broadcast featured speeches from Palmer – who is running as a Senate candidate for UAP in Queensland – and Craig Kelly – the party’s head who is widely expected to lose his lower house seat of Hughes. The speeches were delivered in front of a raucous, applauding crowd wearing yellow party hats. The speeches were broken up with what appeared to be ad breaks showing short promotions of different UAP policies, such as capping mortgage repayment rates at 3%, permanently freezing the fuel excise, and warning that “mass biometric surveillance” was in use in Australia. The cost of the hour-long TV ads pales in comparison to the eye-watering $70m Palmer had vowed to spend on advertising by election day. On YouTube, the UAP spent $9.58m on ads from the beginning of February until 8 May. The party spent $2.38m in the week ending 8 May, according to the most up-to-date figures available, and this weekly spend is understood to have increased since. Meanwhile, the federal Labor party has spent about $1.9m on YouTube ads since the beginning of the year, while the Liberal party has spent about $750,000. Parties have spent less on Facebook and Instagram, but the UAP and Palmer’s personal pages spent $874,000 in ads between 15 February and 15 May, more than double the Liberal Party’s $402,000 in that period, while Labor has spent $1.73m. On Thursday, Guardian Australia reported that experts have denounced a “misleading” claim perpetuated by the United Australia party, and some government MPs, that the World Health Organization will use a possible pandemic treaty to control Australia’s health system, including to arbitrarily impose lockdowns. Now that the broadcast blackout is in effect, the UAP – like the other parties and candidates – is expected to ramp up its ads on social media and other mediums. However as Palmer and Kelly travelled across the country this week to spruik candidates, the party’s image was dealt a blow with reports detailing how more than 20 of UAP’s 173 candidates across the lower and upper houses have faced court in the past or face ongoing matters. They include offences such as unlawful assault, domestic violence, stalking, burglary, intentional destruction of property, trafficking of a controlled drug and medium range drink-driving. Kelly and a party spokesperson defended the party’s vetting process reportedly saying that the UAP had conducted police checks, social media checks and formal interviews to choose candidates. On Wednesday, the party’s candidate in the Melbourne seat of Higgins was granted bail in time for election day. This election, the UAP is directing voters to preference Liberal and Nationals candidates ahead of Labor in a swathe of key seats. UAP preference flows were viewed as helping the Coalition retain seats and enjoy swings at the 2019 election. When the Guardian visited an early polling centre in the eastern Sydney seat of Wentworth last week, more than a quarter of those exiting saidthey voted in favour of the UAP. Several said they were previously swing voters but were attracted by the anti-vaccine mandate and Covid restriction policies of the party. Data analyst Elisa Choy said she believes most polling companies are not capturing the real level of support for the UAP. Ahead of the election, Choy’s company, Maven Data, has scraped thousands of terabytes of information from social media, search trends, news sites and blogs, in an attempt to gain insights into voter sentiment. Maven then scans the data for emotive language, and applies an artificial intelligence tool to gauge the popularity of different political issues and parties. “What I’m seeing is that we, Australians, are not enamoured with either of the major party leaders,” Choy said. “The hard views I have based on the data is that while we are seeing the rise of teal independents in key seats, the UAP appears to be successful in tapping into the great deal of disillusionment across many seats.” Choy said she believed polling participants often don’t respond truthfully, and don’t talk openly about their views, if they think they’ll be judged. “The silent majority of Australians don’t signal things in person or comment their views on social media, but we can look at what they’re reading or watching and what they’re searching on Google when they feel safe that no one is watching them,” she said. While the number of hardcore anti-vaxxers yet to receive any Covid-19 vaccine is low across the country, Choy said that voters sympathetic to UAP could include a much larger share of Australians who felt nudged into getting vaccinated due to government vaccine rules, while others resented harsh Covid restrictions. Choy said her analysis points to topics such as climate change, integrity, interest rates and the cost of living as being most likely to influence voters.",News/Australia news,"UAP may have more backing than polls suggest, with voters too embarrassed to voice support, analysis shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/uap-may-have-more-backing-than-polls-suggest-with-voters-too-embarrassed-to-voice-support-analysis-shows
5/20/2022,"Victoria has staged a last-minute intervention in the federal election campaign, accusing the Morrison government of failing to invest in enough general practitioners for the state. According to data provided to Guardian Australia by the Victorian government, the increase in public sector doctors between 2014 and 2021 had outstripped the growth in GPs in the state by more than 17%. The health minister, Martin Foley, said one reason the state’s emergency departments were under so much pressure was because people were not able to get in to see GPs in a timely manner. In the seven-year period, there was a 44% increase in doctors working in the public health system, a 27% increase in nurses and a 24% increase in other health staff, such as allied health workers. There were now a total of 104,236 health care workers across Victoria’s public health system. Meanwhile, figures from the federal Department of Health website show there had been a 26% increase in full-time-equivalent GPs in Victoria – from 6,236 in 2014 to 7,878 in 2021. Foley said the state was seeing record demand on its public health system. “To help ease that pressure, it’s never been more important for Victorians to be able to easily access GPs in their local community,” he said. “The Morrison government has continually failed to support our GPs by investing in and managing primary care, leading to extra pressure being placed on the public hospital system.” Foley pointed to the the state’s budget handed down earlier this month, which included $12bn to build and expand hospitals, hire 7,000 new healthcare workers, clear the elective surgery backlog and help more people get care at home. “It’s time for Scott Morrison to step up and play his part – to commit to properly fund Victorian GPs and other primary care providers rather than continuing with his deafening silence,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In Queensland, the growth in numbers of full-time-equivalent GPs has been similar to that in Victoria; increasing from 5,165 in 2014 to 6,566 in 2021, or about 26% in seven years. The state’s deputy premier, Steven Miles, said this week that health workers in Queensland hospitals were “getting smashed” and the cause was an “absolute collapse” in primary care. “Lots and lots of people ... can’t get to see a GP, even if they have a regular GP (and) many GPs are declining to see people with respiratory illnesses, sometimes before they get a Covid test, sometimes not at all, and that is driving lots and lots more people to our emergency departments,” he said. “It’s also seeing lots of people delay care and so then when they go to get care, their condition is much more acute and at that point in time they do need the specialist services of our emergency departments.” Like in Victoria, staffing levels and rosters at Queensland hospitals were also hampered by Covid-19 cases among health workers. The situation has created a concern that public hospitals will be badly affected during the coming flu season. “Now that we have both Covid endemic in the community as well as flu ... that is driving a massive peak in demand on our emergency departments,” Miles said. Victoria is also bracing for its first proper flu season in three years, with $54.9m to be spent on setting up modular emergency departments at Casey hospital in Berwick, Northern hospital in Epping and Werribee Mercy hospital. Individual units will be built off-site and are expected to be completed in June, allowing for an additional 24 beds at the Werribee Mercy hospital and 12 beds at both Northern and Casey hospitals. At a federal level, few significant reforms to health have been announced by either of the major parties during the election campaign, though Labor has promised $970m investment in primary health and a boost for infrastructure upgrades in GP practices. The issue of hospital funding also hasn’t been resolved. State and territory leaders, including Victoria’s premier, Daniel Andrews, have been pushing the federal government to permanently lift the commonwealth’s funding guarantee to a 50-50 funding split when the current arrangement ends. Andrews has said when the current pandemic-level hospital funding agreement ended in September, the state faced an effective cut of $1.5bn. “No matter who wins the federal election, these issues are not going away,” he said earlier this month.

But it is absolutely crucial that we have a whole system reform and GPs are incredibly important as the centre of our health system,” she said. “They’re the most efficient use of our money. They provide preventative health care and if well supported, can manage people in aged care with really complex problems, mental health, rehab, palliative care and that will prevent patients ultimately ending up coming by ambulance to the emergency department.” Whitelaw said it was “bizarre” health had not been a bigger focus at the election. “The community absolutely understands how much pressure the system is under and sees it as a key priority,” she said.",News/Australia news,Victorian government enters federal election fray to accuse Coalition of failing to invest in enough GPs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/20/victorian-government-enters-federal-election-fray-to-accuse-coalition-of-failing-to-invest-in-enough-gps
5/20/2022,"We asked Guardian Australia readers about the local issues that matter most to them this election. Broadband speeds, regional public transport, support for children with cleft palates and pollution topped voters’ lists of concerns. We put their questions to candidates. Andrew, a student in his 20s, lives in Wagga Wagga and says that while there is public transport available, the network doesn’t have enough reach to make getting from A to B easy without a car. “I know many people who can’t drive or don’t have their driver’s licence or vehicle, for various financial and health reasons, and have to rely on either the buses or walking to do their shopping, attend classes, or go to work,” he says. Andrew also says some buses in his area only function between 8am and 5pm and that the services are limited and disconnected. “Someone living in Ashmont or Tolland can’t get to work in Kooringal or East Wagga without significant transit times (potentially two hours to get across town, normally a 10-minute drive by car, or about the same amount of time as walking).” The Nationals incumbent, Michael McCormack, acknowledges that people across the Riverina and central west are experiencing cost of living pressures and “access to public transport may create issues for those who do not have access to a vehicle”. McCormack says that if elected, he would continue to work with all levels of government to improve services in the region. He says the NSW state government, which is responsible for public transport, is “undertaking upgrades to improve services and accessibility in those locations, including at Parkes and Wagga Wagga”. The Labor candidate, Mark Jeffreson, recognises that public transport is a “vexed problem” in the Riverina. “Like a lot of things over the last 10 years, the transport situation hasn’t really been addressed,” Jeffreson says. “We would endeavour to work with local and state government to seek a long-term solution.” The Greens candidate, Michael Organ, was also contacted for comment. Residents in electorates including Dunkley, Hughes, Goldstein, Casey and Jagajaga want to see children with cleft lip and palate given better support and access to speech therapy services. Jessica Beckman, a mother of two disabled children, from the electorate of Jagajaga says too many children are suffering from developmental delays from not having access to early intervention services. “My son Ethan is affected by cleft and palate. Not having palate makes speech, language and communication difficult. This affected me because speech pathology services are not free,” says Beckman, who has worked in early childhood education all her working life. As part of CleftPals, a not-for-profit group of volunteers, she is lobbying for speech pathology services to be included in the already existing Medicare cleft scheme and for the condition to be recognised as a lifelong disability under the NDIS. Kate Thwaites, the incumbent Labor member for the seat of Jagajaga in Melbourne’s north-east, says she has met with a local woman who explained how hard it is for her child and other children with cleft palate to get the support they need. “I am committed to advocating for better services for these families and making sure their voices are heard in Canberra,” she says. “Across Jagajaga, I hear from too many families who have been let down by Scott Morrison’s failure to invest in health services and to make the NDIS work as it should to support people with disability. An Albanese Labor government will invest in Medicare and fix the NDIS and I know this will benefit families in our local community.” The Liberal and Greens candidates for Jagajaga were also contacted for comment. Richard Proudfoot from the small town of Maleny in the electorate of Fisher in Queensland, says residents have become “extremely frustrated” with the lack of fast internet connection. Maleny missed out on government initiatives that improve regional national broadband network connectivity. Richard says he has become accustomed to speeds of 10Mbps, and wants to know what the candidates would do to provide better connectivity. Andrew Wallace, the incumbent Liberal member for Fisher, says he understands how “vital” the NBN and phones are to life. He points out that “over 103,000 premises are ready for service in Fisher, compared to just 489 when the Labor party was last in office”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Wallace says the government would be investing $480m to improve communication infrastructure as part of a planned system uplift. He says this would help support more than 1 million people in regional areas, but did not specify whether Maleny would benefit directly from this scheme. Labor’s Judene Andrews made a firm commitment that “almost 1,000 homes and businesses” in Maleny would be plugged into the NBN if Labor won government. “Many towns like Maleny have missed out on having acceptable internet when it’s crucial we all have access to competitive internet speeds in our homes and small businesses. Most Maleny homes have poor internet service and speeds,” she says. People from the electorate of Grayndler in Sydney’s inner west are worried about the fumes coming from the WestConnex smoke stacks in Rozelle. The stacks’ proximity to nearby schools has parents particularly concerned about the effect that toxic fumes may have on their children. They have been organising to demand the stacks be filtered and did receive some backing from the then premier Gladys Berejiklian, although she later backflipped on her stance. Nick from Rozelle says residents were treated “appallingly” throughout the planning and consultation stage. He understands it is a state issue but would like to see it raised on the national level since the project received federal backing. “For a small increase [in] costs our local children’s health could have been better looked after,” he says. “It is unlikely anything will change with WestConnex as a consequence of this election. But it does demonstrate how a major community issue can be lost in the layers of government. Makes a voter wonder for whom and why to actually vote.” A spokesperson for Rachael Jacobs, the Greens candidate for Grayndler, says the Greens had always “stood with the community” in opposition to the WestConnex project. The Greens see the entire project as a waste of money that causes “immense” environmental damage for very little improvement in traffic conditions. The Greens MP Jamie Parker recently moved a bill in the NSW parliament to have the smoke stacks filtered, but both the Liberals and Labor voted against it.

5/20/2022,"The man accused of killing 10 Black people in a racist attack at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, at the weekend was called a coward by a loved one of one of the victims when he made a fresh appearance in court on Thursday. Payton Gendron, 18, who is white, was not required to speak – his court-appointed lawyer had already entered a plea of not guilty to one count of first-degree murder – but it was the first time families of the victims who had come to the courthouse came face to face with him. “Peyton, you’re a coward,” shouted one, as Gendron, who was shackled and dressed in orange Erie county jail clothes, was led out of court to return to custody after the short hearing. Journalists were told by court officials not to approach the 12 family members of victims who attended the court hearing. The identity of the young woman who called out could not immediately be established. Prosecutor Gary Hackbush, the chief of Buffalo’s homicide unit, said that a grand jury had convened on Wednesday and voted for an indictment against Gendron. The suspect had waived his right to a psychiatric evaluation, the court heard. With Gendron’s next court appearance scheduled for 9 June, authorities continue to investigate the options of hate crime or terrorism charges. Under New York criminal statutes, prosecutors can charge a defendant with first-degree murder only under special circumstances, including when multiple people are killed in a single incident. The single count covers all 10 deaths at the supermarket. The Erie county district attorney, John Flynn, issued the following statement after the felony hearing was adjourned: “The defendant continues to remain held without bail. There will be no further comment from our office until there is a report following an investigation by the grand jury.” The investigation includes hundreds of pages of writings by the suspect, detailing his plans for the assault and his racist motivations that he posted to a small group on the social media platform Discord 30 minutes before the shootings began. It is not yet clear if anyone who had access to the screed tried to alert police. New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, announced state legislation, citing “an intersection of two crises: the mainstreaming of hate speech – including white nationalism, racism and white supremacy – and the easy access to military-style weapons”. The House of Representatives passed a bill dealing with domestic terrorism that has previously languished in Congress after failing in the Senate. Hochul also authorized the state’s attorney general, Letitia James, to investigate social media platforms used before the attack, to determine if they were liable for “providing a platform to plan and promote violence”. The suspect wrote in the online forum that he planned the attack after becoming obsessed with white supremacist ideology he had found online. He wrote that he planned his attack in secret, with no outside help. On 15 April he wrote: “I literally can’t wait any longer, my parents know something is wrong.” Two months earlier, he wrote: “My parents know little about me.” “They don’t know about … the hundreds of dollars I’ve spent on ammo. They don’t know that I spent close to $1,000 on random military shit. They don’t even know I own a shotgun or an AR-15, or illegal magazines.” In the messages, he wrote about tensions with Black students at school during childhood. In sixth grade, he wrote, he was suspended for a day after a Black student accused him of using a racist slur against her. In his posts, Gendron wrote he did not think of himself a true racist until 2020 when he began reading 4chan, the online message board. Thursday’s hearing came after it was revealed that an emergency services dispatcher could lose her job after allegedly shouting at the employee at Tops Friendly grocery store who called 911 during the assault on the supermarket. A Tops employee, who was hiding and terrified that the gunman might hear them, alleges the dispatcher asked why she was whispering – then hung up. The employee said she had to call her boyfriend and tell him to dial 911 and report the shooting. The dispatcher, who has not been identified, is facing a disciplinary hearing next week where “termination will be sought”, according to NBC News. Funeral services for the victims of the mass shooting, which included elderly customers and a retired Buffalo police officer, will begin on Friday in Buffalo with Deacon Heyward Patterson.",News/US news,Suspect in Buffalo mass shooting heckled as ‘coward’ in court,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/19/buffalo-shooting-suspect-court-hearing-new-york
