2/22/2022,"Britney Spears has landed a “record-breaking” publishing deal for a tell-all memoir about her rise to fame, her relationship with her family and her experience living under a conservatorship for more than a decade. Page Six reported on Monday that publisher Simon & Schuster had secured the deal for the pop star’s memoir for as much as US$15m (£11m, A$20.8m) after a massive bidding war involving multiple publishers.  An unnamed source told Page Six that “the deal is one of the biggest of all time, behind the Obamas”. The president and first lady signed a deal worth an estimated US$65m to write multiple books for Penguin Random House in 2017. Guardian Australia has reached out to Simon & Schuster for comment. The deal comes months after Spears successfully fought a court-ordered conservatorship, which had been put in place by her father, Jamie Spears, for almost 14 years. The conservatorship, typically for older or infirm people who can no longer make decisions for themselves, was instigated in 2007 after a period of mental illness for Spears. Rumours spread that the singer was being held in the conservatorship against her will, which lead to the creation of the #FreeBritney movement. In 2021 Spears gave public testimony about the conservatorship for the first time, telling a Los Angeles judge that she had been forced to work by conservators despite begging for breaks, and that she had no control over her finances, was denied her wish to marry her boyfriend, and was barred from removing her birth control despite her wish to have a third child. “I’ve been in shock. I am traumatised,” Spears said. “I just want my life back.” The judge suspended her father from the conservatorship in September, before it was lifted entirely in November. Spears said soon after that she believed her family members “should all be in jail” for the “demoralising and degrading” treatment she says she experienced under the arrangement. Spears recently publicly condemned her sister, Jamie Lynn, who made allegations about the singer’s mental health while promoting her own memoir on Good Morning America. Jamie Lynn alleged in the interview last month that Spears had once locked them both in a room while holding a knife and described her behaviour over the years as “erratic, paranoid and spiralling”. In response, Spears accused her sister of “sell[ing] a book at my expense”. Her lawyer issued a strongly worded cease-and-desist to Jamie Lynn, asserting that Spears would “no longer be bullied” by her family. “Although Britney has not read and does not intend to read your book, she and millions of her fans were shocked to see how you have exploited her for monetary gain. She will not tolerate it, nor should she,” the letter read. Last week, Spears was invited to US Congress to discuss her conservatorship legal battle, with two members of the House of Representatives writing to her to ask her to speak about her “empowering” story and “the emotional and financial turmoil you faced within the conservatorship system”.",Arts/Music,Britney Spears lands ‘record-breaking’ book deal for tell-all memoir,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/22/britney-spears-lands-record-breaking-book-deal-for-tell-all-memoir
2/22/2022,"Colombia has decriminalised abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, adding to a recent string of legal victories for reproductive rights in Latin America. The South American country’s constitutional court ruled five against four to decriminalise the procedure on Monday evening. The decision follows a series of rulings in Mexico and Argentina that lowered barriers to abortion.  Previously, abortion in Colombia was allowed only where there was a risk to the life or health of the pregnant mother; the existence of life-threatening foetal malformations; or when the pregnancy was the result of rape, incest or non-consensual artificial insemination. “We celebrate this ruling as a historic victory for the women’s movement in Colombia that has fought for decades for the recognition of their rights,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, in a statement. “Women, girls and people able to bear children are the only ones who should make decisions about their bodies.” “Now, instead of punishing them, the Colombian authorities will have to recognise their autonomy over their bodies and their life plans,” Guevara-Rosas, went on to say. As the ruling was handed down, protesters in favour of access to abortion clad in green – the colour adopted by the pro-choice movement – celebrated in front of Colombia’s constitutional court in downtown Bogotá, the capital. Anti-abortion protesters also demonstrated against the ruling. Abortion rights groups, collectively known as the Green Wave, sued to have abortion removed from the penal code. The movement had previously seen the constitutional court decide not to rule on the matter several times in the past two years. Reproductive rights groups estimate that as many as 400,000 abortions are performed each year in Colombia, with only 10% carried out legally. During 2020, at least 26,223 unsafe abortions were carried out across Colombia, according to Profamilia – a local reproductive healthcare provider. According to Causa Justa, a Colombian women’s rights coalition, at least 350 women were convicted or sanctioned for abortions between 2006 and mid-2019, including at least 20 girls under the age of 18. Latin America, a traditionally conservative region with a powerful Catholic and evangelical Christian lobby, has some of the world’s most restrictive abortion laws, often banning the procedure outright. In El Salvador, dozens of women have been jailed for homicide after suffering obstetric emergencies. “We applaud the constitutional court’s legal and political courage in recognising that women and girls are not second-class citizens,” said Paula Avila-Guillen, an international human rights lawyer and executive director of the Women’s Equality Center, based in New York. “In constitutionally protecting our autonomy over our own bodies and lives, the court is changing the lives of millions of vulnerable women and girls disproportionally harmed by abortion restrictions.” “We celebrate with Colombia’s Green Wave movement as the country becomes the third Latin American country to decriminalise abortion in the last two years,” Avila-Guillen said. “We know this will have a ripple effect in other countries in Latin America that have yet to take this step toward human rights and social justice.” Mexico’s supreme court decriminalised abortion last year, while parliamentarians in Ecuador last week eased regulations which now allow access to abortion in cases of rape. “While today we are celebrating this historic decision, the Green Wave is strong and growing, and the fight for reproductive rights and justice will not end until every person can access high-quality sexual and reproductive healthcare when and where they need it,” said Eugenia Lopez Uribe, the International Planned Parenthood Foundation’s regional director for Americas and the Caribbean region, in a statement.",News/Global development,Colombia legalises abortion in move celebrated as ‘historic victory’ by campaigners,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/colombia-legalises-abortion-in-move-celebrated-as-historic-victory-by-campaigners
