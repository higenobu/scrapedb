4/18/2022,"Two British fighters captured in Ukraine by Russian forces have been paraded on Russian state television asking Boris Johnson to help free them, in a dramatic escalation of the propaganda war. Footage showed Shaun Pinner and Aiden Aslin calling on the British prime minister to help free them in exchange for Ukraine releasing the pro-Kremlin politician Viktor Medvedchuk. It was unclear how freely the two men were able to talk in the video, which was aired on the Rossiya 24 state TV channel on Monday. At the same time as Russia broadcast footage of the two British men, Ukraine’s foreign intelligence service released video of Medvedchuk, nicknamed the “dark prince” of Ukrainian politics, asking to be swapped too. In his appeal to the Russian and Ukrainian leaders, Vladimir Putin and Volodymr Zelenskiy, Medvedchuk asked to be exchanged for the defenders of the besieged city of Mariupol – where Pinner and Aslin were based before their capture – and that any civilians be allowed to leave. The footage marks a serious escalation of the propaganda war between Russia and Ukraine and is the first time a prisoner swap has been suggested publicly between the two countries. The central involvement of two British fighters will heap pressure on Johnson to intervene. The UK Foreign Office (FCDO) has been contacted for comment. The FCDO has been providing support to the men’s families in recent days but has limited ability to gather information or give consular support on the ground in Ukraine. Pinner, 48, looked exhausted in the latest heavily edited footage released on Russian television. In a halting voice, he said to the camera: “Mr Boris Johnson. Obviously I’m Shaun Pinner. “A lot’s gone on over the last five or six weeks that I’m not fully aware of. Obviously I understand that Mr Medvedchuk has been detained and we look to exchange myself and Aiden Aslin for Mr Medvedchuk. “Obviously I would really appreciate your help in this matter and pushing this agenda. Myself I’ve been treated well. Fully understand the situation that I’m in. We’ve been fed, watered, and that’s all I can really say but I beg on my behalf and Aiden Aslin’s behalf for help us in an exchange for Mr Medvedchuk.” The unidentified interviewer was then shown separately speaking to Aslin, who was sat on a chair wearing a T-shirt bearing the emblem of Ukraine’s far-right Azov battalion. “I think that Boris needs to listen to what Oksana [Medvedchuk’s wife] has said,” said Aslin, who also looked nervous. “If Boris Johnson really does care about British citizens like he says he does then he will help.” Pinner and Aslin, 28, have looked tired and bruised since they were captured while defending the city of Mariupol last week. Medvedchuk is a key ally of Putin. He had been placed under house arrest last year to face treason and terrorism financing charges, which he denies. He escaped a few days after the Russian invasion began in February, but was later captured by Ukraine. In his video, published on Facebook by Ukraine’s SBU security service, Medvedchuk said he was a making a “plea for the Ukrainian side to exchange me for the defenders of Mariupol and its citizens who are there today have no opportunity for a safe exit through a humanitarian corridor”. Pinner, a former soldier in the Royal Anglian Regiment, moved to Ukraine four years ago and considers it his adopted country, his family said in a statement on Monday. They said Pinner was a well-respected soldier in the British army for many years and described him as “funny, much-loved, well-intentioned”. They added: “In 2018 Shaun decided to relocate to Ukraine to use his previous experience and training within the Ukraine military. “Shaun enjoyed the Ukrainian way of life and considered Ukraine as his adopted country over the last four years. During this time, he met his Ukrainian wife, who is very focused on the humanitarian needs of the country. He progressed into the Ukrainian marines as a proud member of his unit.” The statement continued: “We would like to make it clear he is not a volunteer nor a mercenary, but officially serving with the Ukrainian army in accordance with Ukrainian legislation. “Our family is currently working with the Foreign Office along with the family of Aiden Aslin, who is also being held by the Russian army to ensure their rights as prisoners of war are upheld according to the Geneva convention.” Pinner’s family said they hoped for a quick resolution to allow the captured men to return to their families. “Our hearts go out to all those caught up in this horrific conflict.”",News/World news,Captured Britons put on Russian TV asking Boris Johnson to help free them,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/captured-britons-russian-tv-johnson-help-free-shaun-pinner-aiden-aslin
4/18/2022,"When Kanye West dramatically pulled out of his headline Sunday slot just two weeks ago, without a reason, few people could have predicted his replacement. A landmark rock act, perhaps? An unexpected pop maven? Nope, it’s a mash-up between America’s brooding prince the Weeknd and Swedish House Mafia, the trio who helped usher in the decade’s turbo-hetero wave of maximalist EDM. They last played the festival in 2012, breaking up not long after. The Weeknd is at the level where he commands the Super Bowl half-time show and, reportedly, West’s $8.5m appearance fee. He hardly needs these three. So what happens when they fuse together? Besides sharing a manager, their pairing makes sense on paper. Mafia men Steve Angello, Axwell and Sebastian Ingrosso are using this to launch Paradise Again, their debut album 15 years in the making, with an apparently darker, more apocalyptic sound – a move to distance themselves from the now taboo EDM tag, which has become synonymous with gimmicky acts like Marshmello. The Weeknd is one of a smattering of its big guest rappers and vocalists like Ty Dolla $ign, ASAP Rocky, and some guy called Sting. His own most recent album, Dawn FM, meanwhile, is his most experimental yet and leans heavily on the noirish electronic pumpers. Together, they have promised a show in three parts: a bit of SHM boingy-boingy, a frisson of Weeknd nihilism, and a collaborative megamix bit. They’ve barely had time to put it together. For once at Coachella, the stakes feel fairly high. Running 30 minutes late, the three Swedes finally appear on stage and assemble like bouncers behind a table about to check your coats, under a giant halo. “Allow us to reintroduce ourselves,” Axwell yells, before an assault of whirring electro, warped trance, piano arpeggios and sandstorm visuals lands with the subtlety of a slap. In SHM terms, their set is fairly diverse: one song has the punch of Justice and a whiff of the riff from Rage Against the Machine’s Killing in the Name. Another chops up 90s vocal house and breakbeats. Then it’s into some industrial-edged rap from their new album, and back to sexy techno and crunchier takes on their peppy anthems like One (Your Name) and Don’t You Worry Child. Clearly they are looking to the recently divorced Daft Punk, whose 2006 pyramid show at Coachella signalled a new dawn for electronic music in America. Or at least Axwell and Ingrosso are, as Angello bounces sort of awkwardly to their side, seemingly not doing very much. SHM’s new dawn are reinstating themselves as a dance music powerhouse, which is all very well, but it still sounds like … EDM? After what feels like forever, here he comes, the Weeknd, ad-libbing on new SHM-produced track Sacrifice, his diamond vocals cutting through the static. SHM appear to still be in a line behind him, prodding buttons. Then it’s into his electro-stomper How Do I Make You Love Me, for which the thwacking drums sound a little soupy. This continues for Can’t Feel My Face, which comes off like it’s been “mafia-ed” into a slightly new distorted version, in keeping with their set. Blinding Lights, however, the Weeknd’s very own Take On Me, is a promising moment, SHM now gone from the stage. He does look a touch lost compared with the Harry Styles and Billie Eilish of nights previous, though, having been parachuted in from filming a TV series at late notice to put on a show, without a band, dancers or any added extras, like, say, a striking outfit. It’s a little like a Swedish House Mafia DJ set with a Weeknd PA. Still, he’s got the hits: I Can’t Feel My Face, Starboy, I Feel it Coming, it goes on, and the glowsticks remain in the air, while his latest Dawn FM material, much of which he debuts tonight, sounds superb. There’s a nod to his predecessor too, as the Weeknd performs part of West’s track Hurricane, as a bridge to older song The Hills. It might have actually made sense to flip their performances, the Weeknd’s moody pulse building into SHM’s triple-pronged ejaculation, though the DJs do reappear for a closing rendition of their collaborative single - and the jewel of SHM’s new album – Moth to a Flame. For a festival that doesn’t seem to take many risks, at least this was something a little off the wall. But it might not be one worth repeating.",Arts/Music,The Weeknd and Swedish House Mafia at Coachella review – a patchy double-act,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/18/the-weeknd-swedish-house-mafia-coachella-review
4/18/2022,"In the sleepy village of Chasiv Yar in Ukrainian controlled-Donbas, about 30 elderly people are waiting to be evacuated to western Ukraine. Almost all of them have been ejected from their homes because of the war in the region, which has worsened since Russia’s full-scale invasion began in February. The three houses, run as a charity nursing home, are in an area of Ukraine surrounded on three sides by more than 100,000 Russian troops. For now, life for the residents is relatively quiet. But a major battle between Ukrainian and Russian forces across the area is expected to begin at any moment. “I saw what happened in Debaltseve. I saw the bodies on the road and the shot-up cars.” said Ievhen Tkachov, the head of the nursing home, about a major battle between Ukrainian and Russian-backed forces that took place in early 2015. “I know there will be no water, no electricity, no heating, no medicine. This lot will become a mass grave in a matter of days,” said Tkachov, referring to his vulnerable residents. “We have to go.” For more than a decade, Tkachov and his family, who are Pentecostalists, have been running charity projects for vulnerable people in the Donetsk region. They started by organising summer camps for children living in state-run homes, then moved on to working with people with drug and alcohol addictions. The nursing home they run is part of a Proliska, a network of non-partisan charitable projects funded in part by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in six different towns in the Ukrainian-controlled east of the country. When the war in the Donbas started in 2014, elderly people forced to leave their destroyed or cut-off homes were taken care of by a combination of locals, including businesses, and international humanitarian organisations. But as the war in Ukraine dropped out of the headlines and money in the region dried up these elderly people found themselves with nowhere to go, said Tkachov. “The issue is that the Ukrainian state will only look after elderly people who have no relatives,” said Tkachov. He said that most of the residents’ children did not want to look after them. “The children must go through a court process to sever their ties for the state to take them. The children are either estranged or find it too difficult emotionally.” In Chasiv Yar there are separate houses for men and women and a third house that acts as a hospice. Several of the residents have already been evacuated. In the men’s house, the Guardian met an 84-year-old widower, Yevhen Kryvoshey, who was evacuated a month ago from Izyum. Izyum is a town near Kharkiv that has been at the centre of fierce fighting between both sides, and has been described by the city’s authorities as a second Mariupol. “They don’t have a visitors’ book, so I’ve written a review myself,” said Kryvoshey, holding a piece of card while balancing on a stick with his other hand. “Your work and labour will stay with me for eternity. I haven’t met so much goodwill in all my life,” read Kryvoshey. Kryvoshey had been put on a truck by the Ukrainian army in mid-March and taken, together with 40 other residents from Izyum, to a church in north Donetsk region. He spent the night sleeping on a mattress on the church floor. Despite his age and fragility, he had no complaints. “It was comfortable, clean and warm.” “The only thing was the [army] truck jolted to a halt suddenly on our journey. I hurt my foot and lost my dentures. There’s nowhere open to get new ones,” said Kryvoshey. He also lamented the possessions he had left behind: “Did you know I had to leave my first edition books? I had one from 1872.” Not all the residents are as upbeat as Kryvoshey. A few have signs of dementia and about 10 are bedridden. In the hospice house, one 80-year-old man originally from Svitlodarsk, a town on the 2014-22 eastern Ukraine frontline, was evacuated more than a year ago because of the fighting. He stopped eating from stress a month ago, said Tkachov. His body has withered away and is barely visible beneath the sheets. Another woman, 72-year-old Larysa Mochaleva, bursts into tears every time she hears the war mentioned. Her thigh bone was broken three weeks ago when she fell hiding from shelling in her apartment in another frontline town, Popasna. “[Popasana] doesn’t exist anymore,” said Mochaleva. When Mochaleva was evacuated, her husband was left behind. He found out only by chance that she was in Chasiv Yar. He is now living in the men’s house. Their son, who fled another town in Donetsk region, will pick them up when they are evacuated to western Ukraine. Regional mayors in the towns of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk told the Observer that more than 70% of residents have fled to avoid being caught up in the battle. Many of those who are left, said the mayors, are elderly people who have nowhere to go or are too immobile to travel.",News/World news,‘We have to go’: nursing home residents await evacuation in Donbas ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/18/ukraine-russia-elderly-people-awaiting-evacuation-donbas
4/18/2022,"The Handmaid’s Tale, The God of Small Things and A Clockwork Orange are among 70 books from across the Commonwealth chosen to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee. Ten books for each of the seven decades of the Queen’s reign were selected by a panel of librarians, booksellers and literature experts from readers’ recommendations spanning 31 countries. The Big Jubilee Read includes “brilliant, beautiful and thrilling writing” in novels, anthologies of short stories and poetry published since 1952, said the organisers. They were “shared stories that define our social and cultural heritage”. But there was controversy over some omissions, including JK Rowling’s Harry Potter series and JRR Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. Susheila Nasta, the emeritus professor of modern and contemporary literature at Queen Mary University of London, said there had been a “big discussion” over JK Rowling as the panel whittled down 152 recommendations to a final list of 70. “Lots of fantastic books were suggested for the list but the feeling in the end was that … [Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone] was primarily a children’s book,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “In terms of the space over that decade, which was the 90s when more and more books were coming out across the Commonwealth, it was decided to make space for a book that was good and equally well received.” In the past two years, Rowling has faced criticism over her rejection of the phrase “people who menstruate” instead of the word “women”, with some accusing her of transphobia. A number of high-profile books, such as Doris Lessing’s 1962 novel The Golden Notebook, also failed to make the final list, said Nasta. “The Golden Notebook … was a huge influence on me, but we had to drop some … There were two books for every place.” The Big Jubilee Read, created by BBC Arts and The Reading Agency, embraces prize-winning books such as Hilary Mantel’s Wolf Hall, Girl, Woman, Other by Bernadine Evaristo and Seamus Heaney’s 1966 Nobel prize-winning poetry collection Death of a Naturalist. The winners of the Booker prize in the past two years – Shuggie Bain by Douglas Stuart and The Promise by Damon Galgut – are included in the final decade. Life of Pi by Yann Martel, whose stage and screen adaptations won Olivier awards and Oscars, is on the 1992-2001 list. Earlier titles include A House for Mr Biswas by VS Naipaul, The Girls of Slender Means by Muriel Spark, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy by John Le Carré, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, Midnight’s Children by Salman Rushdie and Derek Walcott’s epic poem Omeros. The Big Jubilee Read campaign will include events and activities in libraries and bookshops, with resources available for reading groups across the country. Suzy Klein, the head of arts and classical music TV at the BBC, said the list was “a real opportunity to discover stories from across continents and taking us through the decades, books that we might never have otherwise read, and reading authors whose work deserves a spotlight to be shone on it.” The Big Jubilee Read list 1952-61 The Palm-Wine Drinkard – Amos Tutuola (1952, Nigeria) The Hills Were Joyful Together – Roger Mais (1953, Jamaica) In the Castle of My Skin – George Lamming (1953, Barbados) My Bones and My Flute – Edgar Mittelholzer (1955, Guyana) The Lonely Londoners – Sam Selvon (1956, Trinidad and Tobago/England) The Guide – RK Narayan (1958, India) To Sir, With Love – ER Braithwaite (1959, Guyana) One Moonlit Night – Caradog Prichard (1961, Wales) A House for Mr Biswas – VS Naipaul (1961, Trinidad and Tobago/England Sunlight on a Broken Column – Attia Hosain (1961, India) 1962-71 A Clockwork Orange – Anthony Burgess (1962, England) The Interrogation – JMG Le Clézio (1963, France/Mauritius) The Girls of Slender Means – Muriel Spark (1963, Scotland) Arrow of God – Chinua Achebe (1964, Nigeria) Death of a Naturalist – Seamus Heaney (1966, Northern Ireland) Wide Sargasso Sea – Jean Rhys (1966, Dominica/Wales) A Grain of Wheat – Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o (1967, Kenya) Picnic at Hanging Rock – Joan Lindsay (1967, Australia) The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born – Ayi Kwei Armah (1968, Ghana) When Rain Clouds Gather – Bessie Head (1968, Botswana/South Africa) 1972-81 The Nowhere Man – Kamala Markandaya (1972, India) Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy – John Le Carré (1974, England) The Thorn Birds – Colleen McCullough (1977, Australia) The Crow Eaters – Bapsi Sidhwa (1978, Pakistan) The Sea, The Sea – Iris Murdoch (1978, England) Who Do You think You Are? – Alice Munro (1978, Canada) The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy – Douglas Adams (1979, England) Tsotsi – Athol Fugard (1980, South Africa) Clear Light of Day – Anita Desai (1980, India) Midnight’s Children – Salman Rushdie (1981, England/India) 1982-91 Schindler’s Ark – Thomas Keneally (1982, Australia) Beka Lamb – Zee Edgell (1982, Belize) The Bone People – Keri Hulme (1984, New Zealand) The Handmaid’s Tale – Margaret Atwood (1985, Canada) Summer Lightning – Olive Senior (1986, Jamaica) The Whale Rider – Witi Ihimaera (1987, New Zealand) The Remains of the Day – Kazuo Ishiguro (1989, England) Omeros – Derek Walcott (1990, Saint Lucia) The Adoption Papers – Jackie Kay (1991, Scotland) Cloudstreet – Tim Winton (1991, Australia) 1992-2001 The English Patient – Michael Ondaatje (1992, Canada/Sri Lanka) The Stone Diaries – Carol Shields (1993, Canada) Paradise – Abdulrazak Gurnah (1994, Tanzania/England) A Fine Balance – Rohinton Mistry (1995, India/Canada) Salt – Earl Lovelace (1996, Trinidad and Tobago) The God of Small Things – Arundhati Roy (1997, India) The Blue Bedspread – Raj Kamal Jha (1999, India) Disgrace – JM Coetzee (1999, South Africa/Australia) White Teeth – Zadie Smith (2000, England) Life of Pi – Yann Martel (2001, Canada) 2002-11 Small Island – Andrea Levy (2004, England) The Secret River – Kate Grenville (2005, Australia) The Book Thief – Markus Zusak (2005, Australia) Half of a Yellow Sun – Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (2006, Nigeria) A Golden Age – Tahmima Anam (2007, Bangladesh) The Boat – Nam Le (2008, Australia) Wolf Hall – Hilary Mantel (2009, England) The Book of Night Women – Marlon James (2009, Jamaica) The Memory of Love – Aminatta Forna (2010, Sierra Leone/Scotland) Chinaman – Shehan Karunatilaka (2010, Sri Lanka) 2012-21 Our Lady of the Nile – Scholastique Mukasonga (2012, Rwanda) The Luminaries – Eleanor Catton (2013, New Zealand) Behold the Dreamers – Imbolo Mbue (2016, Cameroon) The Bone Readers – Jacob Ross (2016, Grenada) How We Disappeared – Jing-Jing Lee (2019, Singapore) Girl, Woman, Other – Bernardine Evaristo (2019, England) The Night Tiger – Yangsze Choo (2019, Malaysia) Shuggie Bain – Douglas Stuart (2020, Scotland) A Passage North – Anuk Arudpragasam (2021, Sri Lanka) The Promise – Damon Galgut (2021, South Africa)",Arts/Books,The God of Small Things to Shuggie Bain: the Queen’s jubilee book list,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/18/the-god-of-small-things-to-shuggie-bain-the-queens-jubilee-book-list
