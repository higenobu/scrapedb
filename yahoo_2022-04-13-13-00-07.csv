4/13/2022,"The Michigan Attorney General’s office has charged a off-duty DeWitt police officer with felony charges connected to a 2021 incident with a Black teen, where he pulled a gun out on him twice without reasonable cause. The teen also has secured legal representation and filed his own federal civil lawsuit. According to a press release from the state attorney general Dana Nessel, officer Chad Vorce was arraigned on Thursday, April 7, on the below: One count of misconduct in office, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and/or $10,000 Felonious assault with a dangerous weapon, a felony punishable by up to four years in prison and/or $2,000 Felony firearm possession: a felony punishable by two years consecutively with and preceding any term of imprisonment imposed for the felony or attempted felony conviction in a Clinton County District Court. Vorce initially was fired for these crimes, but reinstated months later after the department said “he has learned his lesson” and showed a “genuine demonstration of remorse” for his actions. The state believes a court of law should determine this. The AG’s investigation found Vorce, who was not on duty at the time of the incident, broke the law when he pulled a gun out on Alexander Hamilton, a 19-year-old paperboy on Jan. 14, 2021, despite his belief the boy was “driving erratically in his neighborhood.” Nessel said, “Our assessment of this incident showed dangerous behavior exhibited by Mr. Vorce. Those who swear to protect and serve must do so responsibly. We will not hesitate to hold accountable those who violate that oath.” A day after these charges were made, Hamilton filed his own federal lawsuit, alleging the 18-year-veteran officer and his colleagues violated his Fourth and 14th Amendment rights by the use of excessive force, illegal seizure, false arrest and false imprisonment on that early spring morning. He also alleged these state authorities racially discriminated —pointing to Vorce identifying him by race when reporting the incident to others. The lawsuit, which plays off the young man’s name by using a rendering of the opening song of the Hamilton Broadway musical based on the founding father with the same name, records the teen was on an assigned route to drop off papers when he encountered the off-duty officer. His lawyer Dustyn Coontz explains his client was in the area of Shadybrook Lane and Driftwood Drive, which is in Watertown Township, Clinton County, around 7:15 a.m., on the day of the altercation only to perform his job’s duties. Vorce saw the teen’s minivan while he was taking his child to school and determined he was “driving in a manner that he claims to have been suspicious.” “According to Vorce, there had been some theft-related crimes in his neighborhood recently,” the lawsuit states. “Upon seeing a ‘frickin’ Black guy’ in a black hoodie, Vorce became even more suspicious that Hamilton was a potential criminal.” The officer, who doubled as a volunteer firefighter, approached the teen and asked him what he was doing. Hamilton allegedly responded, “I’m just doing me.” At this point, frustrated he could not get the answer he wanted, nor the van’s plates to run his tags, he called the Clinton County Central Dispatch for assistance. The claim says the first line of the CAD report read — another indicator that race was an issue — “BLK MALE IN THE AREA JUST DOING ME NEEDS CHECKED.” Vorce now started to follow Hamilton in his vehicle. Ultimately, the van backed up on Vorce (twice) and each time, the officer believed this was an attempted assault on him. He reported to “dispatch he was ‘going to go shots fired’ if Hamilton did it again.” Hamilton alleged he was trying to get away, but that Vorce’s vehicle gave him no room for him to make a U-turn. The officer claimed at this time the teen tried to “ram” his truck again, got out of his truck and “pulled his pistol out on Hamilton” the first time. When he returned to his truck, he told dispatch, the lawsuit alleges, “this was now a priority call and that things would ‘turn out really bad’ if help didn’t arrive quickly.” Simultaneously, Hamilton said, fearful for his life, he tried to escape to a public place, the Sunoco (AKA Tailgaters) at 3955 Ernest Way, thinking Vorce would not do anything violent there. Off duty officer Chad Vorce pulled his GUN on a teen who was delivering newspapers and said “when I see a Black guy … I think you’re doing stuff like this.” This use of force & bias is DISGUSTING. Thankfully, the teen was not hurt and Vorce was fired! pic.twitter.com/V8hb0rnmkG — Ben Crump (@AttorneyCrump) November 15, 2021 Vorce continued to challenge the teen, but this time using “wigwagging” headlights” and “emergency light” to represent himself in his occupational capacity. When he emerged from the vehicle, he identified himself as a police officer, before pulling out the gun on Hamilton for the second time. The lawsuit reveals Officer Clyde Smith, a cop that works in the same department as Vorce, arrived at the scene, despite the location of this incident being out of the jurisdiction of the DPD. “Smith has claimed he responded because he was close to the scene and was there to assist Michigan State Police in its investigation and that he didn’t know Vorce was the complainant,” the lawyer writes. “But Smith would’ve known from radio traffic that Vorce—or “7602” or “602,” as dispatch routinely called him—was the complainant.” The filing says Smith removed the delivery driver from his van and started to arrest “him citing the possibility that Hamilton committed assault with a dangerous weapon by trying to ram Vorce.” During this process, Michigan State police trooper Luke Shafer arrived on the scene. He and Smith interviewed both Hamilton and Vorce, but did not stop their colleague from engaging the teen. Shafer later consulted with two other sergeants at the Lansing Post and found there was no basis to arrest Hamilton. Hamilton’s lawsuit names Vorce, Smith, DeWitt police chief Bruce Ferguson and the City of DeWitt as defendants. It claims the ordeal has caused the plaintiff to “suffer emotional distress” and the officer’s actions were “extreme and outrageous.” The city and chief are listed as “Smith was in uniform and responded to the scene in a marked patrol car, so everything he did here was plainly under the color of State Law,” operating with an authority those parties gave him. He is suing for damages for the “emotional and psychological injuries” caused by being exposed to police-involved violence, “punitive damages for the defendants’ intentional and outrageous conduct demonstrating evil motive and a reckless or callous indifference to Hamilton’s rights” and lawyer fees. Hamilton also wants Vorce to be barred from law enforcement “until the day he dies.” Vorce has not answered the lawsuit and is scheduled to appear before Judge Michael E. Clarizio in the 65A District Court.

4/13/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — Japanese Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi said he and his Italian counterpart agreed Tuesday to step up military cooperation as Japan expands security ties with Europe amid concern about Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its impact on Asia. Kishi told reporters that he and Italian Defense Minister Lorenzo Guerini discussed the possible expansion of joint military drills and development of defense technology. Guerini, who is visiting Tokyo, especially expressed interest in possible Italian participation in Japan’s F-X next generation fighter jet, Kishi said, declining to elaborate. It would be Japan’s first domestically developed fighter jet in 40 years. Japan and Britain have agreed to jointly develop a future demonstration fighter jet engine and to explore other combat air technologies and subsystems. The project includes Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI in Japan and Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems in the U.K. The two ministers agreed that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine undermines the foundation of the international order, not only in Europe but also in Asia, and is “absolutely impermissible.” “We agreed on the importance for countries that share fundamental values, such as Japan and Italy, to stick together and act resolutely,"" Kishi said. Kishi said Japan highly regards Italy’s interest and involvement in the Indo-Pacific, where China's increasingly assertive military activity has raised tensions. Japan in recent years has significantly expanded security talks and joint drills with the U.S. and other partners in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe that share its concerns about China’s assertion of its territorial claims in the region, which has some of the world’s busiest sea lanes. Japan is not a NATO member but has strengthened its partnership with the group. It sent Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi to join the NATO foreign ministers' meeting earlier this month to discuss Ukraine. Japan is especially concerned about Chinese military and coast guard activity in the East China Sea near the Japanese-controlled Senkaku islands, which China also claims and calls Diaoyu. China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei have been locked in a tense territorial standoff in the South China Sea for decades. China defends its activities as its own right.",World/Associated Press,"Japan, Italy to lift defense ties amid China, Russia worries",https://news.yahoo.com/japan-italy-lift-defense-ties-134406034.html
4/13/2022,"NEW YORK (AP) — A gunman wearing a gas mask set off smoke grenades and fired a barrage of bullets inside a rush-hour subway train in Brooklyn, wounding at least 10 people Tuesday, authorities said. Police were trying to track down the renter of a van possibly connected to the violence. Chief of Detectives James Essig said investigators weren't sure whether the man, identified as Frank R. James, 62, had any link to the subway attack. Authorities were looking at the man's apparent social media posts, some of which led officials to tighten security for New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell called the posts “concerning.” The attack transformed the morning commute into a scene of horror: a smoke-filled underground train, an onslaught of at least 33 bullets, screaming riders running through a station and bloodied people lying on the platform as others administered aid. Jordan Javier thought the first popping sound he heard was a textbook dropping. Then there was another pop, people started moving toward the front of the car, and he realized there was smoke, he said. When the train pulled into the station, people ran out and were directed to another train across the platform. Passengers wept and prayed as they rode, Javier said. “I’m just grateful to be alive,” he said. Five gunshot victims were in critical condition but expected to survive. At least a dozen people who escaped gunshot wounds were treated for smoke inhalation and other injuries. Sewell said the attack was not being investigated as terrorism, but that she was “not ruling out anything.” The shooter's motive was unknown. Sitting in the back of the train's second car, the gunman tossed two smoke grenades on the floor, pulled out a Glock 9 mm semi-automatic handgun and started firing, Essig said. A rider’s video shows a person raising an arm and pointing at something as five bangs sound. Passengers in the smoke-filled car pounded on the door to an adjacent car, seeking to escape, rider Juliana Fonda, who was in that adjoining car, told the news site Gothamist. Fonda is a broadcast engineer for Gothamist's owner, public radio station WNYC. Investigators believe the shooter’s gun jammed and kept him from firing more, said two law enforcement officials who weren’t authorized to discuss the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity. Essig said police found the weapon, along with extended magazines, a hatchet, detonated and undetonated smoke grenades, a black garbage can, a rolling cart, gasoline and the key to a U-Haul van. That key led investigators to James, who has addresses in Philadelphia and Wisconsin, the detective chief said. The van was later found, unoccupied, near a subway station where investigators determined the gunman entered the train system, Essig said. Rambling, profanity-filled YouTube videos apparently posted by James, who is Black, are replete with Black nationalist rhetoric, violent language and bigoted comments, some of them directed at other Black people. One, posted April 11, criticizes crime against Black people and says drastic action is needed to change things. Several videos mention New York's subways, and Adams is a recurring theme. A Feb. 20 video says the mayor and governor’s plan to address homelessness and safety  in New York City’s subway system “is doomed for failure” and refers to himself as a “victim” of the mayor’s mental health program. A Jan. 25 video criticizes Adams’ plan to end gun violence. The attack unnerved a city on guard about a rise in gun crimes  and the ever-present threat of terrorism. It left some New Yorkers jittery about riding the nation's busiest subway system and prompted officials to increase policing at transportation hubs from Philadelphia to Connecticut. “This individual is still on the loose. This person is dangerous,” Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, warned at a midday news conference. In Menlo, Iowa, President Joe Biden praised “the first responders who jumped in action, including civilians, civilians who didn’t hesitate to help their fellow passengers and tried to shield them.” After people streamed out of the train, quick-thinking transit workers ushered passengers to another train across the platform for safety, transit officials said. High school student John Butsikaris was riding that other train and initially thought the problem was mundane until the next stop, when he heard screams for medical attention and his train was evacuated. “I’m definitely shook,” the 15-year-old said. ""Even though I didn’t see what happened, I’m still scared, because it was like a few feet away from me, what happened.” New York City has faced a spate of shootings and high-profile bloodshed in recent months, including on the city’s subways. One of the most shocking was in January, when a woman was pushed to her death in front of a train by a stranger. Adams, a Democrat a little over 100 days into his term, has made cracking down on crime — especially in the subways — an early focus of his administration, pledging to send more police officers into stations and platforms for regular patrols. It wasn’t immediately clear whether any officers were in the station when the shootings occurred. The mayor, who is isolating following a positive COVID-19 test on Sunday, said in a video statement that the city “will not allow New Yorkers to be terrorized, even by a single individual.” ___ Balsamo reported from Washington.
