4/9/2022,"Jennifer Lopez has announced her engagement to actor Ben Affleck – 19 years after the couple first called off their wedding. The singer and actor, 52, shared the news with fans via her OnTheJLo newsletter. In the email, she posted a video of herself admiring a large green-stoned engagement ring on her finger. The clip then pans up to her face, and shows her appearing to wipe away tears, before she says: “You’re perfect.” Lopez trailed the “major announcement” via her Twitter and Instagram accounts, where she encouraged followers to register for her newsletter. The news comes a year after the pair publicly rekindled the romance following almost two decades apart. They started dating in July 2002, and announced their engagement in November that year. The couple were to be married the following September but postponed the wedding days before the ceremony. In January 2004, they called the engagement off and separated. “Ben and I split up at the moment when I thought we were committing to each other forever, it was my first real heartbreak, it felt like my heart had been torn out of my chest,” Lopez wrote in Page Six in 2014. Just three days after her cancelled wedding, Lopez began dating American singer Marc Anthony. She married him in June 2004. She confirmed she was back together with Affleck in on Instagram after her 52nd birthday, when she shared a photograph of herself kissing the actor aboard a private yacht. “You never could imagine something like that could happen,” Lopez told Ellen DeGeneres about the relationship. “It’s a beautiful thing.” Affleck was previously married to actress Jennifer Garner, with whom he had three children – Violet, 16, Seraphina, 13, and Samuel, 10. They divorced in 2018 after 13 years of marriage. Affleck remains guarded over public comments about his personal life, telling the Wall Street Journal in December: “One of the harder lessons that I have learned is that it’s not wise to share everything with the world. “There are some things which are private and intimate and have meaning in terms of their intimacy by dint of the fact that they’re not shared with the rest of the world.” Lopez was married to Marc Anthony for 10 years. They were divorced in 2014, and have twins Emme and Max, 14. Lopez was also married to Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998, and Cris Judd from 2001 to 2003.",Arts/Culture,Jennifer Lopez says she and Ben Affleck are engaged (again),https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/09/jennifer-lopez-ben-affleck-engaged-again
4/9/2022,"A Memoir Blue opens at a press conference, a thatch of interviewers’ microphones aimed at the protagonist as she flinches in a lightning storm of camera flashes. In her right hand she holds aloft a swimmer’s Olympic medal. This young woman has reached the pinnacle of her athletic career. Yet despite this she appears detached, even glum, here in the hot centre of the world’s adulation. Back at her apartment we see her mantelpiece sag under the combined weight of her trophies, but as dusk fills her room, she sits alone on her sofa, bereft. Wealth, glory and high attainment, in almost any field, are often accompanied by less desirable effects: isolation, confusion, loneliness, an obsessive anxiety about losing, or failing to maintain that which has been won. These negatives are rarely acknowledged by the successful: to complain after one has gained what everyone else desires can seem ungrateful and churlish. A Memoir Blue is a dialogue-free attempt to explore why success so often contains the seeds of failure, and specifically the emotional dynamics that might lead someone to channel the wild energies of childhood into the unusual demands of professional sports. The story is told via a dream, in which the champion protagonist (she is never named) returns to scenes in her childhood and watches her younger self at key moments in her life. This younger self is rendered as a two-dimensional cartoon moving through a 3D world. You must nudge the narrative along using a pointer that allows a few limited interactions with the world: pushing coins into a ticket machine before boarding a train; moving planks of wood to create a bridge across a river; guiding raindrops on to a newspaper to reveal a new memory in one of the photo panes. These are puzzles only according to the loosest definition; this hour-long “interactive poem” presents meagre resistance en route to its conclusions. Early in the dream we see the girl develop an obsession with water, the sea and aquatic life, chasing fish, parting the fronds of sea plants, all the while longing for the attention of her ambitious and detached mother. The depiction of a young single mother raising a small child is carefully and unsentimentally portrayed . There is an awkwardness to watching the intimacies, the failures inherent in any parent-child relationship, from such proximity; the feeling that you shouldn’t be party to such private moments. There is hope and reconciliation here, but A Memoir Blue is primarily a tragic depiction of a person who has convinced themselves – or who has been convinced – that attainment is necessary for love. The story is fragile and a little simple but, like publisher Annapurna Interactive’s 2018 game Florence, it succeeds in creating a mood of compelling melancholy, heightened by Joel Corelitz’s exquisite soundtrack. And while A Memoir Blue feels deeply personal, it achieves that miraculous narrative trick of making the specific universally approachable.",Arts/Games,A Memoir Blue review – a deep dive into the price of success,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/apr/09/a-memoir-blue-game-review-olympic-swimmer-annapurna
4/9/2022,"A British autism charity that received hundreds of thousands of pounds in national lottery funding has links to the anti-vaccine movement and is being jointly run by a campaigner who likened the Covid-19 jab rollout to a Nazi war crime. Thinking Autism also promoted unproven autism treatments in testimonials on its website and directed families to clinicians linked to the disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield, an investigation has found. The Charity Commission said it had opened a case into the charity and was assessing evidence passed to it by the Observer. It comes seven years after a campaigner claims she first raised concerns about Thinking Autism with the regulator and National Lottery Community Fund. Awarded charity status in 2006, Thinking Autism claims to “change lives” by providing “hope, emotional support and practical information” to autistic people and their families, and has received £389,750 from the lottery fund since 2015. It is jointly run by Joanne Allman, a vocal Covid sceptic who last year stood as a local election candidate in Sefton, Merseyside, for the Freedom Alliance, a “campaigning political party” born out of the pandemic to “resist attacks on medical freedom and body autonomy”. On social media, Allman – described in records as a trustee, treasurer and director of Thinking Autism – dismissed Omicron as “moronic variant scariant BULLSHIT” in a post on Facebook in November 2021 and last month re-shared a post on Twitter calling the vaccine rollout a “reckless, dangerous, insane experiment”. In other posts she said PCR testing was a “fraud underlying the greatest hoax in medical history” and tweeted that people “the world over” were being “coerced into having an experimental vaccine”. Alongside a picture of the Nuremberg trials, held after the second world war to bring Nazi war criminals to justice, she wrote: “How long will we have to wait before those … who are complicit in tyranny are brought to justice for crimes against humanity?” While those posts were from Allman’s personal accounts, campaigners expressed safeguarding concerns for vulnerable families seeking help from Thinking Autism, which hosts conferences, online events and runs a private Facebook group. The charity itself has publicly been largely quiet on Covid-related issues, aside from announcing its opposition to vaccine passports. But it has a history of promoting misinformation dating back to at least 2014, when it shared a video in support of research by Andrew Wakefield, who was struck off the medical register for a discredited study claiming vaccines were linked to autism. Its website, meanwhile, carries testimonials for unproven autism “treatments” including homeopathy and “CEASE therapy”, a pseudoscientific approach that claims to remove supposed toxic effects from outside sources, including vaccines. Campaigner Emma Dalmayne, who runs Autistic Inclusive Meets, a non-profit organisation that advocates for autistic people, said she first reported concerns about the charity’s alleged promotion of unproven treatments to the Charity Commission and National Lottery Community Fund in 2015. She questioned why it was still operating seven years later. “The Charity Commission is potentially putting vulnerable children at risk by lending credibility to organisations like Thinking Autism,” she said. Michael Marshall, project director at the Good Thinking Society, which campaigns against pseudoscience, said it was “extremely troubling” to see people linked to the charity “trying to undermine efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19”. “If they cannot understand the importance of public health measures, and cannot refrain from baseless scaremongering about vaccines, they should not be in a position where their misinformed opinions may put children in harm’s way,” he said. Thinking Autism said members of the charity were “free to hold their own views” and that it endorsed the rights of autistic people and their families to speak about their healthcare experiences. It said it heard from “hundreds of families” each year thanking it for its support. “The charity does not endorse any specific view except that people with autism who are suffering from healthcare problems deserve appropriate investigations and treatments,” it said. “Because healthcare is an individual and personal choice, and because we are not medical professionals but rather parent volunteers, we are explicitly clear on our website and social media that information we provide should not be construed as medical advice.” Allman said the posts were made from her personal social media accounts and did not make references to autism. “My personal opinions on Covid-related issues have no bearing on my role as a director and trustee of Thinking Autism,” she said. The Charity Commission said it had opened a compliance case relating to concerns raised about Thinking Autism, “including the charity’s use of social media”, and was “currently engaging with the trustees”. It said it had “no record” of a 2015 complaint. The National Lottery Community Fund, which allocates money raised by the lottery to community groups and charities, said its funding relationship with Thinking Autism “reached its conclusion” in 2020. It declined to comment on why the relationship continued after thealleged 2015 complaint but said: “We take all concerns raised with us seriously.”",News/Society,Revealed: autism charity chief has links to anti-vaccine movement,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/09/autism-charity-chief-has-links-to-anti-vaccine-movement
4/9/2022,"The USA Network has been encouraging its Twitter audience to engage on the topic of Manchester City v Liverpool. The cable channel, whose strapline is “here for the characters”, will be showing the top-of-the-table Premier League clash on Sunday morning United States time and it put out a call for gifs of characters “fierce enough to compete on the pitch during such an iconic matchup”. Perhaps unsurprisingly for a channel that largely shows reality TV, witty responses weren’t overly forthcoming. There were only eight replies in total, and five of them came from accounts of other channels owned by NBC, which holds the rights to Premier League action. “Peacock” suggested Ron Swanson, of Parks and Recreation, would make a “perfect hard-nosed defender”. “SyFy” nominated the hunky Tate from the monster-strewn comedy Astrid & Lilly Save the World. “E!” picked out Paris Hilton for “galloping into our hearts and on to the field”, which made more sense when you learned that the channel has new episodes of Paris in Love every Tuesday night. A game effort by a number of social media managers, but perhaps the responses are indicative of where the big match sits in terms of global interest right now. We’re used to hearing that the Premier League is an international product, that it’s watched in “188 of the world’s 193 countries recognised by the United Nations”. We also know of the fan clubs in places far from the Etihad and Anfield (and for those in Delhi this weekend, the Manchester City supporters group will be watching live at “virtual-reality-led entertainment gaming centre” Smaaash at the Radisson Blu). But will this match be stopping traffic in Mumbai? Will the game be on everyone’s lips in Guadalajara? It’s a question that’s not easy to answer. The Premier League does not share international viewing figures on its games. It prefers to talk more broadly about their reach and the cumulative audience of 3 billion plus for all matches in all countries over the course of a season. These big figures are calculated by Nielsen, the experts in TV ratings, which conducts research for the Premier League on its audience. Approached by the Observer for an estimate on the likely global audience for City v Liverpool, Nielsen Sport gave a slightly more down-to-earth number. As “one of the most viewed fixtures in recent seasons”, it was likely to exceed 20 million live viewers across the globe. Or about five million more than the season-six finale of Line of Duty managed on BBC1 last year. To make a footballing comparison, Fifa claims that the World Cup final of 2018 was watched by 884 million people at home on their television screens (with another 232 million watching out of home or digitally). Another instructive comparison might be el clásico. La Liga likes to say that the reach of its biggest match is around 650 million people (that is, those who might catch some of it at some point). Actual live viewing is more like 100 million, still some way greater than the total City and Liverpool is expected to hit. To pitch a single league match against the World Cup final, the most watched sporting fixture on the planet and a global event, might not be contrasting like with like. El clásico, meanwhile, is a match of historical importance regardless of where Real Madrid and Barcelona are in the league table. The discussion over where the competition between Pep Guardiola and Jürgen Klopp ranks in the list of great Premier League rivalries is a reminder that City against Liverpool has not always been the biggest match in the English top flight, not even five years ago. Deloitte’s authoritative Money List of the biggest clubs in world football made headlines this year when it placed City at the top of the rankings, after raking in revenues that totalled €645m (£540m) in the 2020-21 season. But another telling statistic in the report was the one totting up City’s social media followers, as close to a proxy for global support as is publicly available. Across Facebook and Instagram City had 70 million followers, fewer than any other club in the top 10 bar Tottenham. The biggest English clubs by that reckoning were Chelsea and, far out in front with 130 million Facebook and Instagram followers, City’s neighbours and 20-time champions, Manchester United. All of which brings us back (just about) to NBC’s cross-channel Premier League promotional push. The broadcaster, which has 13 subsidiary channels but is also one of the traditional big three commercial networks in the US, recently committed a reported £2bn to renewing its Premier League rights until 2028. This, it might not need explaining, is the most any American broadcaster has paid for foreign “soccer” rights and came after heavy competition from rivals, including the Disney-owned ESPN. So it is not surprising to see the broadcaster using all its channels to promote the Premier League product. But it is also the case that NBC would not have committed such money if the investment were defined by a single fixture. The Premier League in its entirety is the compelling product and it is not only American broadcasters who think so. In the coming years revenue from the Premier League’s overseas TV rights (once given away for free) will exceed domestic takings for the first time. Manchester City v Liverpool may not be the most watched match in world football, but the Premier League is a global hit every weekend of the season.",Sport/Football,Manchester City v Liverpool short on global pull but Premier League still wins,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/09/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-audience-worldwide
4/9/2022,"As Easter approaches, let us turn to 83-year-old Dutch cinematic provocateur Paul Verhoeven for spiritual guidance. In 2008 he published Jesus of Nazareth, a historical study of the journeyman carpenter. Now, continuing his recent vein of European arthouse served with a dollop of pulp trash, comes Benedetta (in cinemas from Friday), a salacious story of lesbian nuns in a 17th-century Tuscan convent. Charlotte Rampling and Virginie Efira star. The score for Benedetta comes from English composer Anne Dudley. The polymath musician was also a member of avant-pop band the Art of Noise, alongside producer Trevor Horn and journalist Paul Morley. In the full pomp of his 1980s new pop label ZTT, Horn produced Grace Jones’s 1985 album Slave to the Rhythm. Jones also had time in 1985 to pull up to the final Roger Moore Bond as May Day in A View to a Kill, with Christopher Walken playing dastardly industrialist Max Zorin. More recently, Walken can be seen in the “impressively idiosyncratic” workplace dystopia drama Severance (Apple TV+). Also in Severance is John Turturro. Walken’s wife, Georgianne, meanwhile, was a casting director and worked on The Sopranos, which never featured Turturro but did include his cousin Aida as Tony’s (played by James Gandolfini) sister Janice. Gandolfini was in the musical Romance & Cigarettes, directed by John, though directing isn’t his forte. Time hasn’t been kind to his Fading Gigolo, in which he also played a male sex worker, with Woody Allen his pimp and Sharon Stone his client. A museum piece. At the height of Verhoeven’s run of Hollywood flicks with an arthouse inflection, Stone was in the brilliant Total Recall, and stole the show in peak erotic thriller Basic Instinct. Notorious screenwriter Joe Eszterhas was behind that and Verhoeven’s follow-up flop Showgirls. Like Verhoeven, Eszterhas dabbles in religion, having written a book about finding Christianity, and a troubled account of working for Mel Gibson in Heaven and Mel. Helluva title. Watch Reviled then revered is a trademark of Verhoeven’s films. His 1997 totalitarianism satire Starship Troopers grows in stature, while the 2019 documentary You Don’t Nomi examines the lingering power of Showgirls.

4/9/2022,"Using a typical credit or debit card to withdraw cash on an overseas break could mean paying costly and unnecessary fees. But shop around before you go and you could avoid paying over the odds. The financial firm Moneyfacts say a holidaymaker taking out £250 from an overseas ATM will typically face charges of £11.88. The same withdrawal on a credit card would typically attract £14.95 in fees, before interest. Using the cards in shops and restaurants can also be costly, it says, with a £50 spend on a debit card attracting £1.38 in fees, and the same purchase on a credit card costing £1.50. The figures are based on HSBC accounts. “Those well overdue a holiday may be paying more for their trip and the rising cost of living could also be denting their spending money,” says Rachel Springall, a finance expert at Moneyfacts.co.uk. “Holidaymakers may then be looking to make their cash go further, and avoiding a typical debit or credit card for spending abroad is a good way to avoid wasting cash on unnecessary fees.” The fees to look out for are transaction, conversion and withdrawal fees, which are often 2% or more of the money being spent or withdrawn. Many banks also have a minimum, which means costs can be relatively higher on small purchases and withdrawals. Moneyfacts says there are debit and credit cards available that do not attract fees. For debit cards, that means opening a current account with the provider, which could mean committing to paying in a certain sum each month. Starling Bank, Metro Bank and Virgin Money all offer fee-free current accounts which do not charge in Europe for using a debit card. Metro Bank and Virgin Money have transaction fees on card use in countries further afield. Credit cards without transaction fees are available, but there will be other costs associated with this type of spending, including interest on any cash that you have withdrawn in most cases. Barclaycard Rewards Visa, Halifax Clarity Mastercard and 118 118 Money Mastercard all allow travellers to make withdrawals and payments without extra fees and can be applied for by customers of any bank. “Some holidaymakers may prefer to get some currency last minute at an airport or train station, but not only can these exchange rates be poor, but there is also the danger in having cash lost or stolen,” says Springall.",Lifestyle/Money,Want to avoid card fees for cash withdrawals abroad?

4/9/2022,"Beth Mead says her third England hat-trick in six months during 2023 World Cup qualifying after being dropped from the national team and Team GB ahead of the Olympics shows her confidence has been restored after she “channelled my disappointment in the correct way”. After England’s 10-0 defeat of North Macedonia in Skopje on Friday, she said: “I never thought I would have scored a hat-trick in all these qualifiers. We can let these things break us or we can use them as motivation, and I think it motivated me this season to do better on and off the pitch. I can control what I’m doing and enjoy my football. Hopefully that’s showing on the pitch right now, I’m confident and that’s really showing.” Mead conceded that not flying to Tokyo was a blow but she is using that setback to help recover her best form in an England shirt. “I think I’m in between,” she said. “I’m over it, but I can also still try and use it in the right way to motivate me. There were a lot of question marks over that decision, but I have to accept that, swallow it. Some people can let it affect them but I’ve used it in the right way and I’m getting the rewards of it.” Part of that uplift has been because the new manager, Sarina Wiegman, has “settled” her this season. “I’ve come into this season and played with confidence, not overthought my game too much,” said Mead. “I know I have the capabilities to be a good player and do good things on the pitch. I guess last season I maybe got into my head a bit too much and I think Sarina has settled me, given me confidence, starts in some games, and I’ve really relished playing under her.” Mead has further benefited from Lauren Hemp’s blistering work on the opposite flank, which was evident against North Macedonia in particular. “It’s super nice to play with Lauren and Ellen [White] up top,” said Mead. “Lauren can beat any full-back in the world and sometimes you know if you get in the box she’ll produce a good cross or a good effort and you get on the rebound. A couple of them happened today and that’s why I got on the end of them – her positive play sometimes becomes my positive play.” Her first goal started with a Hemp cross that Mead slammed into the roof of the net at the far post after White struggled to connect. Her third came from another Hemp cross, and her fourth was poked in after the goalkeeper Viktorija Panchurov parried a Hemp shot. Mead’s second was a neat, dinked effort over Panchurov that slipped inside the far post just ahead of the waiting White. The Arsenal forward walked into the press conference clutching a match ball and was flanked by Ella Toone, who also had a match ball hunder her arm after her second hat-trick in the same period having only made her senior debut in February 2021. “It’s so good to share this moment with Beth,” said Toone, whose second goal came after Mead knocked the ball down to her unmarked in the middle. England now travel to Belfast to play Northern Ireland at a sold-out Windsor Park on Tuesday night. The hosts, ranked 46th in the world, will provide a tougher test than North Macedonia, ranked 132nd, and give the Lionesses a flavour of the challenge they will face in this summer’s Euros, with Northern Ireland also in Group A.

4/9/2022,"Holidaymakers looking to get away for Easter are facing major disruption to travel, as airlines cancel more than 100 flights a day because of staff shortages and ferry operators struggle to meet demand following the suspension of P&O Ferries services. The rise in passenger numbers over the spring break has coincided with high rates of staff absences due to the latest wave of Covid infections. Manchester airport said travellers would continue to face waits of 60-90 minutes to get through security over the next two weeks, while Heathrow, Gatwick and Birmingham airports face similar disruption. Airport bosses are encouraging passengers to arrive at least three hours before their flight to make it through to the departure lounge on time. The ferry company DFDS reported delays of two hours on its service from Dover to Calais on Friday, with similar delays expected throughout the weekend. Thousands of lorries trying to reach the port of Dover were still being held on Saturday as a 23-mile (37km) stretch of road into Dover, the M20 southbound, remained closed. “Alongside the beginning of the Easter holidays and smaller-scale incidents throughout the transport network, it has created a queue … in excess of 20 miles and around 2,000 lorries,” the Road Haulage Association told Sky News. The Spanish haulage body Fenadismer said its drivers outside the port remained trapped inside trucks “without being able to access adequate resting places or minimum hygienic and sanitary conditions”. The company urged the European Commission to put pressure on Britain to resolve the delays. Meanwhile, people travelling to France via the Channel tunnel have been advised to bring food and drink. Toby Howe, the tactical lead at the Kent Resilience Forum, also advised travellers to France to “allow a lot of extra time”. “Make sure you have got some food and drink because there will be delays,” he told BBC Breakfast. “A lot of the minor roads, therefore, are chock-a-block.” A technical issue with the website used to process post-Brexit travel documentation had initially increased delays at the port, he added, but that matter had since been resolved. Richard Ballantyne, the CEO of the British Ports Association, called for the Dover delays to be categorised as a “major incident” so they could be cleared more quickly. “If there is a major incident, then the local resilience forum would get more resourcing,” he told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Friday. “The police, the national highways, the port would be able to channel more resources to ease the situation.” The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, urged operators on Friday to “redouble their efforts” to get “people away as smoothly as possible”, but Labour accused the government of being “missing in action”. The shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said on Saturday: “Tory ministers need to step up and act to ease the disruption. The government need to begin clearing the huge backlogs in security checks so airport staff can safely begin work. “And they should be holding emergency talks with ferry operators and Eurotunnel to boost capacity following P&O’s shameful action.” P&O Ferries suspended operations in March after a criminal and civil investigation was launched into it sacking 800 members of staff without notice. It previously accounted for a third of travel capacity at Dover. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “P&O’s unacceptable actions have resulted in its vessels being detained, causing backlogs and traffic jams which would be substantially alleviated if its fleet was operating normally. It’s left operators, local authorities and, of course, government having to clear up the mess. “That, alongside bad weather and the Easter rush, has meant that roads are exceptionally busy. We are receiving real-time updates as the Kent Resilience Forum, police and regional leaders work around the clock to ease disruption and support those affected.”",News/UK news,UK holidaymakers face cancelled flights and ferry delays in Easter travel chaos,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/09/uk-holidaymakers-cancelled-flights-ferry-delays-easter-travel
4/9/2022,"If you have picked up any intelligence about the Russian-German pianist Igor Levit, it is surely that he cannot resist a marathon. The demands of performing long works, alone on stage, do not need spelling out. The motivation for Levit, evident in every note he plays, is the music. In early lockdown in 2020, when the world was reeling and the technology itself had not been mastered, Levit embarked on nightly, livestreamed concerts from his Berlin home for more than 10 weeks. In addition to standard repertoire, he plays epic compositions few dare touch, whether the piano concerto by Ferruccio Busoni (a trifle at 75 minutes) or Erik Satie’s Vexations (20 hours). At Wigmore Hall last week, Levit chose two giants of the repertoire that he has recorded and performed in public before. This makes the achievement no less extraordinary. He began on Monday with Shostakovich’s 24 Preludes and Fugues, Op 87, with Passacaglia on DSCH by the Scottish composer Ronald Stevenson (1928-2015) two nights later. This homage to Shostakovich is built around the Russian composer’s four-note name motif (we’ll leave the decoding, via Cyrillic script and German notation, for another day). Stevenson uses the motto hundreds of times, with extravagant ingenuity. Pianistically, songlike moments aside, the Passacaglia casts the player to the four winds, with blizzards of notes and swirls of rhythmic challenges to combat. On the page it is clear, structured, detailed, asking for the piano to sound like a guitar, timpani, trumpet; far-off, ponderous, primal. Writing the work in 1961 when the Soviet astronaut, Yuri Gagarin, went into space, Stevenson instructs: with a sense of space, “quasi gagarinesco”. Yes, call it maverick. A visionary, a Marxist, a conscientious objector, this singular composer should be better known. Levit is the best of ambassadors, inviting us to embrace the music’s curiosities, and to discover its potent beauty. Bach’s 48 Preludes and Fugues were the impetus for Shostakovich’s Op 87. The perspective, combining free-form prelude and formal fugue in every key, flickers between entity and detail. A comparison might be the double helix within the swirling carapace of Tatlin’s Tower, the gigantic piece of Soviet constructivist art proposed for Shostakovich’s home city of St Petersburg but never built. Crushed by the Union of Composers when they heard his “ugly” work, Shostakovich not only completed his mighty edifice but created a work of art for posterity. Levit showed, with gleaming clarity, the terrain these pieces travel: now playful ditty, now majestic oratory, now a glimpse at Tchaikovsky or a chorale-like contemplation of Bach. The D flat prelude, a waltz, had a mechanical precision, the tick-tock figure passing between hands, as if sprung. The vast final fugue flung itself against a stunned audience, who could only leap to their feet once Levit, lifting his hands away from the keyboard at last, let us know it was over. St Martin-in-the-Fields, the colonnaded landmark on the north-east corner of Trafalgar Square, walked past by every tourist, has been reinvigorated as a venue for high-level concerts, with new partnerships with, among others, John Eliot Gardiner and his Monteverdi Choir and Orchestras. In its HP Futures series, outstanding artists will give solo recitals. The constant rumble of traffic and trains forces us to listen more acutely than ever, especially if the soloist is a guitarist whispering the most hushed and mysterious of lute music. The Edinburgh-born virtuoso Sean Shibe opened his recital – entitled “Baroque meets Minimalism” – with a selection from the Scottish lute manuscripts of the 17th century, remade in this guitarist’s own subtly ornamented and poetic fashion. In Bach’s lute Suite in E minor, BWV 996, every twist of counterpoint, each voice, was clear and unforced. For this part of the recital, Shibe used an instrument made by Simon Ambridge in 2011, a copy of the classic Hauser played by pioneer guitarists of the past, Segovia and Julian Bream. He then switched to electric guitar, first to the cutaway Fender Stratocaster, then to a PRS Custom 24-08. You need to be an insider to appreciate the different specs, but enjoying the variety is part of the Shibe experience. Messiaen’s motet O sacrum convivium (1937) was freshly ecstatic, resonating around the building. In Pushing my thumb through a plate by Oliver Leith (b1990), originally for harp, now in a new version for guitar, Shibe used the tuning pegs to whoop slowly in and out of aural focus, a meditation on flux and inconstancy. (Leith’s new opera about Kurt Cobain was announced last week for the ROH’s Linbury theatre next season.) He is a restrained performer, as if staying within his own magic circle of energy, keeping all in reserve for the music. To end, he captivated with Steve Reich’s Electric Counterpoint (1987). Performing live against a tape of himself playing a dozen accompanying guitar parts, Shibe reminded us of the power of one.",Arts/Music,The week in classical: Igor Levit; Sean Shibe – review,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/09/igor-levit-wigmore-hall-london-review-shostakovich-stevenson-sean-shibe-st-martin-in-the-fields
