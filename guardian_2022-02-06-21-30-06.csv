2/6/2022,"In June 2021, the American magazine the Atlantic ran a long and admiring profile of Boris Johnson. “To him,” wrote the author, “the point of politics – and life – is not to squabble over facts; it’s to offer people a story they can believe in.” Johnson himself made the same point, in rather more elegant language: “People live by narrative. Human beings are creatures of the imagination.” Back then, those words were intended to capture Johnson’s talent for an unorthodox kind of political communication, and explain his success. But in early 2022 they sound more like an encapsulation of the reasons for his inevitable demise. The simple tale of the people who made the rules arrogantly breaking them is now immeasurably more powerful than any of the narratives he offers in his defence. To say that people tell stories, moreover, is often to associate them with lies, and so it has proved. Johnson’s evasions and untruths now extend into the distance; what he repeatedly – and desperately – said about Keir Starmer and Jimmy Savile is only the latest example.  There is one more sense in which his talent for storytelling has deserted him. “Partygate” has cost him credibility and popularity, but it has also had another result that has been overlooked. Johnson’s apparently awful hypocrisy means he can no longer talk about a story all of us have lived through, and which has still not been satisfactorily told: that of the pandemic, the awful suffering and sacrifices it entailed, and what that experience says about us collectively and individually. That is a very strange position for a prime minister to be in. Imagine if next week there was a national Covid memorial service at St Paul’s Cathedral or Westminster Abbey. The Queen would attend and give a reading; past premiers would solemnly take their seats alongside doctors, nurses and other NHS workers. If Johnson was still in office, it would be unusual if he did not speak. But given his indelible association with rule-breaking and recklessness, could he do it? Perhaps his brass neck would lead him to carry on as if nothing had happened, but the moment would be so awkward that it would threaten to render the whole occasion ludicrous. Whatever the weekend’s chatter about a new Downing Street operation and a “return to Tory values”, all he seems to have left is mindless boosterism and a set of props. He puts on hard hats and makes endless claims about the UK’s economic strengths, but they sound increasingly crass; all those habitual boasts about the rollout of vaccines – symbolised by his seemingly daily visits to hospitals – suggest he’s claiming credit for other people’s efforts. He cannot weave a tale about the privations of the pandemic giving way to the benefits of Brexit or the glories of “levelling up”, because both are being revealed as fantasies. Not surprisingly, the current public mood feels almost numb: when all plan B restrictions in England were lifted on 27 January, it was telling that rather than hype about another “freedom day”, there was an overwhelming sense of everything remaining tense and uncertain – a feeling that the spiralling cost of living and evidence of a national mental health crisis are only making things worse. Johnson has promised a “UK commission on Covid commemoration” and a “fitting and permanent” official national Covid memorial, but hardly any details have materialised. Meanwhile, answering the need for a story about what we have all experienced, people and places are beginning to collectively mark the pandemic – both the lives that were lost and the shared spirit that got us through it. Commemorative spaces and artworks are being unveiled all over the country. In London there is the national Covid memorial wall, whose spontaneous origins make it feel all the more authentic and human. The Welsh government is planting two commemorative woodlands. Scotland has a government-funded project called Remembering Together, intended to create occasions and spaces for remembrance, and honour how the country’s communities “continue to come together during the most difficult times”. As Johnson flounders, other politicians have come up with their own versions of that basic narrative – as happened last week, when Starmer responded to Sue Gray’s “update”. He spoke about people who followed the rules and restrictions now being consumed by “rage, by grief and even by guilt”, and the need for them to “feel pride in themselves and their country, because by abiding by those rules they have saved the lives of people they will probably never meet”. But on the political right, the narrative vacuum Johnson has left is being filled by stories that feel toxic and dangerous. In some Tory circles, any idea of a dutiful public making sacrifices for the common good is at risk of being replaced by something very different: the belief that lockdowns and restrictions were simply a failed experiment, and what motivated people to follow what the Conservative backbencher Steve Baker recently called “minute restrictions on their freedom” was not a willing spirit of collective sacrifice, but a state that had decided “to bully, to shame and to terrify them”. On the wilder fringes of the internet, similar ideas are expressed by the irate keyboard warriors who insist that those of us who supported Covid rules were dupes and “bedwetters”. Johnson’s endless disgrace will only fuel those stories. We already know that around £14bn of public money was wasted on fraudulent Covid loan claims and unused personal protective equipment. The apparently imminent public inquiry into Britain’s experience of the pandemic will doubtless unearth more evidence of such misrule and incompetence. As people’s fury about Downing Street parties festers, these things may yet be the perfect raw material for a grimly familiar tale that would perfectly suit Nigel Farage and his ilk: the idea that the pandemic really boiled down to yet another betrayal of the people by a rotten elite, and that most of the restrictions and rules were never really necessary in the first place. Its effects could go well beyond politics, into people’s basic wellbeing: if this story catches on, it may only deepen the sense of torment and confusion that has already pushed many people over the psychological edge. These are the dangers that the nodding-dog Tory supporters of a failed prime minister need to wake up to. People really do live by narratives, and in times of collective crisis those who rule us need to give us at least some sense of where we have been, where we might be going, and what everything means. Johnson’s serial stupidities mean he is simply unable to do that: if the great storyteller has no stories, his own tale has surely reached its end.

2/6/2022,"One hundred years ago, the leader of the last great expedition of the heroic age of polar exploration died from a heart attack as his ship, Quest, headed for Antarctica. The announcement of the death of Ernest Shackleton on 30 January 1922 was greeted with an outpouring of national grief. This was the man, after all, who had saved the entire crew of his ship Endurance – which had been crushed and sunk by ice in 1915 – by making a daring trip in a tiny open boat over 750 miles of polar sea to raise the alarm at a whaling station in South Georgia.  It remains one of the greatest rescue stories of modern history and led to the lionising of Shackleton in the United Kingdom, a reputation that survived intact for the rest of the century. As his contemporary Raymond Priestley, the geologist and Antarctic explorer, later put it: “When disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton.” Now the centenary of his death is being marked with a lavishly illustrated exhibition – Shackleton’s legacy and the power of early Antarctic photography – which opens at the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), in London on Monday and which includes a range of images and artefacts from his expeditions. In addition, a digitally remastered version of South, a documentary film – one of the first ever made – of Shackleton’s 1914-16 Endurance expedition is being screened at the British Film Institute in London. The film and most of the exhibition’s finest images are the handiwork of Frank Hurley, who sailed with Shackleton and who was one of the 20th century’s greatest photographers and film-makers. Both film and exhibition feature striking camera work and provide vivid accounts of the privations that Shackleton and his men endured as they headed off to explore Antarctica. Born in Ireland and raised in south London, Shackleton first visited the south pole when he served on the 1901-03 Discovery expedition led by Robert Scott. Shackleton later returned with his own expedition, on the Nimrod, and led a four-man party that got within 100 miles of the pole in January 1909. And here, poised on the threshold of greatness, Shackleton turned back his party as his calculations suggested his men had insufficient rations to ensure a safe return. He was right. As they staggered back towards their base camp, over the Beardmore glacier, they began to suffer from bitter cold, endured near starvation and were left with their clothes in tatters. “It is neck or nothing with us now … Our food lies ahead and death stalks us from behind,” Shackleton wrote in his diary. His men just made it but would certainly have perished had they ploughed on to reach the pole that had been only a short distance away. As the RGS exhibition notes, Shackleton’s decision was courageous. Two years later, two expeditions reached the south pole. The first party to arrive was led by the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen. The second was directed by Scott – whose party perished as they tried to get back to base camp. Not to be outdone, Shackleton devised an even more ambitious reason for returning to Antarctica. He would lead an expedition that would traverse the entire continent, a proposal that was derided by Winston Churchill, then first lord of the Admiralty. “Enough money has been spent on this sterile quest,” he told Shackleton, in an exchange highlighted in the RGS exhibition. “The pole has already been discovered.” Shackleton replied that “death is a very little thing and knowledge very great … and really Regents [sic] Street holds more dangers than the 5 million square miles that constitute the Antarctic continent”. His confidence was misplaced as events transpired although his argument prevailed. Endurance set off, in August 1914, from West India Docks in London, just as war was declared with Germany. (Shackleton offered to turn back to help Britain’s war effort but was allowed to proceed.) By January 1915, the ship had reached the Weddell Sea where some of the worst pack ice ever recorded began to slow down the Endurance until, on the 19th, she could go no further. The ship and her crew were trapped. Shackleton set up a camp on the ice and for months he and his men waited in the hope that it might melt and eventually free the Endurance. At the same time, Hurley set about taking some of the most dramatic photographs in the history of 20th-century polar exploration, including stunning backlit images of the imprisoned, ice-covered Endurance. “It was pitch dark and Hurley was allowed to set up flares around the ship,” said Alasdair MacLeod, curator of the RGS exhibition. “These flares were sequenced to go off at exactly the same moment that Hurley pressed his camera shutter. But when they went off he was temporarily blinded by the light and stumbled into the ice. “However, the depictions he produced are probably among the most iconic in the history of photography.” Looming out of the ice, its masts and rigging glowing against the black Antarctic night, the images also provide the RGS exhibition with its most dramatic highlights. Then, in October, the ice eventually cracked the Endurance’s hull and she began to sink. Shackleton abandoned ship and he and his 27 men piled on to the ice. The sled dogs that the crew had lovingly tended for more than a year, and the ship’s cat, Mrs Chippy, were shot and the men took to their ship’s three lifeboats, eventually reaching the uninhabited Elephant Island on 15 April, more than a year since they had last stood on dry land. The party were far from safety, however. Elephant Island is bleak and inhospitable and was far from shipping routes. So Shackleton and five others, including the Endurance’s captain Frank Worsley, took to the sea again in one of its lifeboats – the James Caird – and set sail for the whaling station at Stromness on South Georgia 750 miles away. After 15 days at sea, in the face of hurricane-force winds, their little open boat reached South Georgia – thanks to Worsley’s considerable navigation skills. All that separated the men – who were suffering from cold or frostbite – from the island’s whaling station were the mountains of South Georgia. With only a 50-yard stretch of rope to link them, Shackleton, Worsley and a third crewman, Tom Crean, traversed the range in 36 hours – and were able to raise the alarm at the whaling station on 20 May 1916. No one had crossed the island before they made that trip. Shackleton returned to Elephant Island on 30 August on the Chilean ocean-going tug Yelcho and evacuated his men – who had survived by eating penguin and seal flesh. Back in England, Shackleton volunteered for the army and later served with the North Russia Expeditionary Force, advising on the training of British forces in Arctic conditions. He still yearned for another trip to Antarctica, however, and after long negotiations set sail in Quest, from England, with the aim of circumnavigating Antarctica. Shackleton was by now very ill and had suffered at least one heart attack. On 2 January 1922, he wrote in his diary: “I grow old and tired but must always lead on.” Three days later he had a major heart attack and died a few hours later. He is buried on South Georgia, scene of his greatest triumph. “Shackleton was an inspirational leader,” added MacLeod. “He had an innate sense of what was possible and achievable. He also had a huge personality but led by example. At the same time, he was sensitive to the needs of the individuals he was leading. For example, after Endurance broke up, his men had lost their protection and shelter. Their social fabric had been destroyed. There would have been dissent. Yet Shackleton succeeded in keeping them together and made sure they survived.”",News/Science,How Ernest Shackleton’s icy adventure was frozen in time,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/feb/06/how-ernest-shackletons-icy-adventure-was-frozen-in-time-antarctica
2/6/2022,"Amid the hype over her acclaimed performance as Diana, Princess of Wales in Spencer, Kristen Stewart briefly stopped awards pundits dead in their tracks when, upon being asked about her Oscar buzz, she drily admitted, “I don’t give a shit.” Sacrilege! Some of the best films and performances of all time haven’t been considered by the Academy, she continued. “There’s five spots. What the fuck are you going to do?” Nobody disagrees with Stewart on any of this: just ask our critics, whose ideal Oscar ballots below are knowingly far from the expected reality of next week’s nominations. That the actor’s comments made showbiz headlines anyway speaks to the strange aura the Oscars maintain as a gold standard of cinematic achievement: for several months a year, people fret and discuss and strategise about them, while companies expensively campaign for them, only to spend the rest of the year complaining that they don’t mean anything anyway. Even Stewart’s scepticism emerged while on the campaign trail, being interviewed on a Variety podcast named Awards Circuit. Should she win for Spencer, she’ll doubtless turn up and give a humbly grateful speech anyway. That’s the game. Nobody gives a shit about the Oscars, after all, except when everyone does.Here, then, are our critics’ picks of who and what should be on those Oscars shortlists. Guy Lodge  PETITE MAMAN Summer of Soul The Green Knight Titane Censor Céline Sciamma’s Petite Maman rekindled my faith in the universal power of cinema. Summer of Soul was a revelation that has been shortlisted for the documentary feature award. Meanwhile, Julia Ducournau’s Palme d’Or winner Titane bizarrely failed to make the best international feature selection. The bookies favour The Power of the Dog for best film, but Belfast has the popular touch. CÉLINE SCIAMMA – PETITE MAMAN Julia Ducournau – Titane Guillermo del Toro – Nightmare Alley Jane Campion – The Power of the Dog Prano Bailey-Bond – Censor The real-world title fight seems to be between Jane Campion and Kenneth Branagh, with Siân Heder a possibility for Coda. My award would go to either Céline Sciamma, who has barely put a foot wrong since 2007’s Water Lilies, Julia Ducournau, for her thrillingly confident follow-up to Raw, or Guillermo del Toro, who previously won for The Shape of Water. JENNIFER HUDSON – RESPECT Agathe Rousselle – Titane Kristen Stewart – Spencer Alana Haim – Licorice Pizza Niamh Algar – Censor British writer and director Aleem Khan’s terrific After Love is not eligible for this year’s Oscars – if it were, Joanna Scanlan would be in my list. Of those actually in the running, Jennifer Hudson was born to play Aretha Franklin, although Respect fails to live up to her barnstorming central performance. Special mention to Agathe Rousselle for her fearless turn in Titane. DEV PATEL – THE GREEN KNIGHT Will Smith – King Richard Riz Ahmed – Mogul Mowgli Bradley Cooper – Nightmare Alley Hidetoshi Nishijima – Drive My Car Will Smith, Benedict Cumberbatch and Andrew Garfield seem to be Oscar frontrunners. A statuette for Smith (who’s been nominated twice before) would be deserved. My picks include the endlessly versatile Dev Patel for The Green Knight and Riz Ahmed (who should have won for Sound of Metal last year) for Mogul Mowgli, which didn’t open in the US until 2021. KATHRYN HUNTER – THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH Ariana DeBose – West Side Story Aunjanue Ellis – King Richard Martha Plimpton – Mass Ann Dowd – Mass There are lots of things wrong with Joel Coen’s visually striking but dramatically inert The Tragedy of Macbeth, yet Kathryn Hunter’s astonishingly physical performance elevates the project. Ariana DeBose steals the show in Spielberg’s West Side Story with a performance that is full of energy and wit, while Aunjanue Ellis proves the perfect foil for Will Smith in King Richard. VINCENT LINDON – TITANE Jason Isaacs – Mass Reed Birney – Mass Ciarán Hinds – Belfast Reece Shearsmith – In the Earth The ensemble cast of Mass seems to have been largely overlooked by the major awards – a tragedy since they are superb. I’ve nominated all four in my supporting actress/actor picks. My list also includes Reece Shearsmith in a film that most Oscar voters won’t have seen or even heard of. But it’s Vincent Lindon’s transformative turn in Titane that takes top prize. JONNY GREENWOOD – SPENCER Daniel Hart – The Green Knight Robert Aiki Aubrey Lowe – Candyman Germaine Franco – Encanto Jeymes Samuel – The Harder They Fall Depressingly, the 15-strong Oscar shortlist (from which I’ve drawn my picks) includes only one female composer: Germaine Franco. My favourite score of 2021 was Eiko Ishibashi’s heartbreakingly beautiful music for Drive My Car, alongside Nainita Desai’s score for The Reason I Jump, (which isn’t eligible). Jonny Greenwood is a favourite for The Power of the Dog, but his score for Spencer gets my vote. THE LOST DAUGHTER The Power of the Dog Zola The Worst Person in the World Red Rocket It has been a thrilling year for cinema, with a wealth of bold, daring visions staking a claim on the big screen. Not that you would necessarily know it to look at this year’s best picture frontrunners. Rather than some of the safer options, I would love to see Janicza Bravo’s nerve-jangling road trip Zola get a nomination or Sean Baker’s grubby, funny Red Rocket. But my pick would be Maggie Gyllenhaal’s sinuous, unsettling debut, The Lost Daughter. JANE CAMPION – THE POWER OF THE DOG Maggie Gyllenhaal – The Lost Daughter Joanna Hogg – The Souvenir Part II Janicza Bravo – Zola Sean Baker – Red Rocket Great direction isn’t just about the showy flex of the big-budget spectacle. For me, one of the most intriguing and satisfying pieces of work this year was the playfully mercurial introspection of Joanna Hogg’s The Souvenir Part II. But my pick for the top prize is Jane Campion, for her emotionally attuned and assured direction of The Power of the Dog. OLIVIA COLMAN – THE LOST DAUGHTER Alana Haim – Licorice Pizza Renate Reinsve – The Worst Person in the World Tessa Thompson – Passing Agathe Rousselle – Titane It’s hard to pick a favourite in this category. How to choose between the guarded self-possession of Tessa Thompson in Passing and the serrated intensity of Agatha Rousselle in Titane? Renate Reinsve’s magnetism in The Worst Person in The World and Alana Haim’s glorious delivery of the line: “Fuck off, teenagers”? Ultimately, however, it has to be Olivia Colman’s endlessly fascinating performance in The Lost Daughter for the win. HIDETOSHI NISHIJIMA – DRIVE MY CAR Joaquin Phoenix – C’mon C’mon Simon Rex – Red Rocket Riz Ahmed – Encounter Benedict Cumberbatch – The Power of the Dog The best acting doesn’t necessarily mean the most acting. In the best actor category, I have found myself drawn to reined-in, introspective performances that seduce the audience rather than assault them with a firework display of emotional range. Joaquin Phoenix in C’mon, C’mon is a rumpled, rueful pleasure. But it’s the rare delicacy of Hidetoshi Nishijima’s work in Drive My Car that has stayed with me. RUTH NEGGA – PASSING Jessie Buckley – The Lost Daughter Ann Dowd – Mass Ariana DeBose – West Side Story Gaby Hoffman – C’mon, C’mon Ariana DeBose is looking like a frontrunner in this category and deservedly so: she is electrifying in West Side Story. Jessie Buckley, once again demonstrating that she’s one of the most exciting actors of her generation, could take the prize for The Lost Daughter. But I would love to see Ruth Negga win for her magnetic and treacherous charisma in Passing. KODI SMIT-MCPHEE – THE POWER OF THE DOG Vincent Lindon – Titane Woody Norman – C’mon, C’mon Richard Ayoade – The Souvenir Part II Jason Isaacs – Mass There’s a certain elasticity in the definition of what constitutes a great supporting turn – is it something like Richard Ayoade’s performance in The Souvenir Part II, which leaves an unforgettable impression from just a handful of scenes? Or a performance like Kodi Smit-McPhee’s – my pick this year – in The Power of the Dog, which is an essential component of the film’s slippery sensuality? THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD Drive My Car Compartment No 6 Prayers for the Stolen Playground The Parasite effect has refocused attention on the international feature category, which can only be a good thing. I hope that smaller titles, such as Laura Wandel’s riveting Playground and Tatiana Huezo’s Prayers for the Stolen reach a wider audience as a result. But my pick for the win is Joachim Trier’s The Worst Person in the World, a joy of a movie that embraces the chaos and charm of its central character. THE SOUVENIR PART II Dune Licorice Pizza The Lost Daughter Zola The Souvenir Part II deserves international acclaim; it has been criminally overlooked by awarding bodies here in the UK, missing out on Bafta’s best film and best British film longlists. It’s about those first, tentative green shoots of creative confidence, made by a director whose talent and authority are finally in full bloom. The film is heartbreakingly poignant and my clear winner. JANICZA BRAVO – ZOLA Jane Campion – The Power of the Dog Maggie Gyllenhaal – The Lost Daughter Rebecca Hall – Passing Joanna Hogg – The Souvenir Part II Janicza Bravo’s bravura vision transforms a viral Twitter thread into an entire world, bringing visual wit, an arch sense of humour and a distinctly feminine point of view to what might, in the wrong hands, feel like tawdry sleaze. Hollywood can feel like a bit of a desert when it comes to new ideas; Bravo is one of several female directors whose perspective feels like an enlivening, ice-cold glass of water. ALANA HAIM – LICORICE PIZZA Olivia Colman – The Lost Daughter Jodie Comer – The Last Duel Taylour Paige – Zola Honor Swinton Byrne – The Souvenir Part II I hope Alana Haim goes on to have a long and successful career. Paul Thomas Anderson has a way of bringing out the best in his actors, which feels even more miraculous given this is the pop star’s film debut. She’s endearingly gawky and naturally intelligent, with a flirtatious quality that translates beautifully on screen. An Oscar nomination would certainly put her on more film-makers’ radars. HIDETOSHI NISHIJIMA – DRIVE MY CAR Anders Danielsen Lie – The Worst Person in the World Andrew Garfield – Tick, Tick… Boom! Cooper Hoffman – Licorice Pizza Denzel Washington – Macbeth Not a vintage year in the best actor category, which will probably see a familiar Hollywood face collect another gong to add to their collection. The Academy’s bias towards English-language films doesn’t help Hidetoshi Nishijima’s case, but he’s a cut above the rest in Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car. He’s subtly brilliant as a man whose placid exterior hides stinging grief. RUTH NEGGA – PASSING Jessie Buckley – The Lost Daughter Kathryn Hunter – The Tragedy of Macbeth Ariana DeBose – West Side Story Tôko Miura – Drive My Car All five of these actors outshine their co-stars, despite the smaller size of their roles. Forget West Side Story’s main character, Maria – she’s a charisma vacuum compared to Ariana DeBose’s Anita. Kathryn Hunter is an obvious frontrunner for her memorably twisted turn as the witches in The Tragedy of Macbeth, but for sheer star wattage I have to champion Ruth Negga’s luminous performance in Passing. MIKE FAIST – WEST SIDE STORY Richard Ayoade – The Souvenir Part II Colman Domingo – Zola Kodi Smit-McPhee – The Power of the Dog Woody Norman – C’mon C’mon I’m crossing my fingers for Mike Faist, whose ferocious bad-boy bite gives him the edge in the otherwise respectable West Side Story. Equally deserving, though, would be the giddying, sharply tuned comic performances given by Richard Ayoade and Colman Domingo, Kodi Smith-McPhee’s slinking intelligence, on display in The Power of the Dog or the emotionally translucent 11-year-old Woody Norman in C’mon C’mon. PROCESSION Ascension Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry Faya Dayi Flee This category is voted for by a specialist documentary branch; its shortlist of 15 has been announced, and happily, some of their more leftfield choices overlap with my own. I’d love to see something formally experimental rewarded, like Faya Dayi, Jessica Beshir’s trancelike exploration of the stimulant khat, or Procession, Robert Greene’s creative collaboration with six survivors of child abuse in the Catholic church. DRIVE MY CAR The Green Knight Moffie Procession The Souvenir Part II After a surprise sweep of the major US critics’ awards, Drive My Car, Ryusuke Hamaguchi’s languid, longing meditation on grief, companionship and Chekhov is now a dark horse for a best picture nomination, potentially disrupting what otherwise looks to be an all-English-language lineup. With bland titles such as Belfast and Coda seen as sure things, there’s really no excuse for it not to make the cut. TATIANA HUEZO – PRAYERS FOR THE STOLEN Janicza Bravo– Zola Jane Campion – The Power of the Dog Julia Ducournau – Titane Maggie Gyllenhaal – The Lost Daughter Having struggled to limit my best picture selections to five in a strong and diverse year, I opted to pick five completely different films for best director. All are distinctive visions from female film-makers working at a high level of risk and formal daring, none more so than Salvadoran-Mexican doc-maker Tatiana Huezo, whose devastating first fiction film blends socially conscious realism with earthy poetry. RUTH NEGGA – PASSING Olivia Colman – The Lost Daughter Rebecca Hall – The Night House Tôko Miura – Drive My Car Tessa Thompson – Passing Ruth Negga has been categorised as a supporting actress in Rebecca Hall’s exquisite directorial debut, but I disagree: even if she has less screen time than the excellent Tessa Thompson, her magnetic performance as a white-passing black woman in 1920s New York City is the film’s thematic linchpin. Hall, meanwhile, makes the cut for her film-elevating turn in the underrated horror The Night House. BRADLEY COOPER – NIGHTMARE ALLEY Yuriy Borisov – Compartment No 6 Hidetoshi Nishijima – Drive My Car Simon Rex – Red Rocket Kodi Smit-McPhee – The Power of the Dog Bradley Cooper has quietly racked up eight Oscar nominations in various categories, without winning any of them. This isn’t looking like his year either, despite a pair of superb performances in very different registers. His all-American slickness is subverted to intense, dark-souled effect in Nightmare Alley, while his brief, delightfully gonzo turn in Licorice Pizza (see below) provides impressive contrast. JESSIE BUCKLEY – THE LOST DAUGHTER Ana De Armas – No Time to Die Gaby Hoffmann – C’mon C’mon Charlotte Rampling – Benedetta Suzanna Son – Red Rocket Only twice in Oscar history have two actors been nominated for playing the same character in one film: both times, Kate Winslet (in Titanic and Iris) was one of the beneficiaries. Buckley deserves to muscle in on that stat: playing the younger version of a peak-form Olivia Colman, she subtly but uncannily echoes the physical and unravelling psychological presence of her older counterpart. ANDERS DANIELSEN LIE – THE WORST PERSON IN THE WORLD Richard Ayoade – The Souvenir Part II Bradley Cooper – Licorice Pizza Colman Domingo – Zola Jared Leto – House of Gucci Last year, Minari’s Youn Yuh-jung became the first actor since Marion Cotillard in 2007 to win an Oscar for a wholly non-English-language performance; even as the Academy diversifies, Anglocentric bias is the norm. As the broken heart of Joachim Trier’s lovely reflection on millennial ennui, Norwegian actor Danielsen Lie — who maintains a career as a medical doctor between films — deserves to buck the trend. JOANNA HOGG – THE SOUVENIR PART II Amalia Ulman – El Planeta Paul Thomas Anderson – Licorice Pizza Sean Baker and Chris Bergoch – Red Rocket Joachim Trier and Eskil Vogt – The Worst Person in the World Dubiously, Academy rules define all sequels as adaptations, though Joanna Hogg isn’t drawing on anything other than her own experience and imagination in her dazzling self-portrait of the artist as a young woman. Bafta absurdly left The Souvenir Part II off a 20-title longlist for best British film; I’m not expecting the Academy to notice it either, though it’s a masterwork just the same.",Arts/Film,My award goes to... our film critics reveal their personal Oscars shortlists,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/06/the-observers-alternative-oscars-shortlists-nominees-2022
2/6/2022,"Fifteen-year-old Maria (Rihane Khalil Alio) is pregnant and in desperate need of an abortion. The procedure is taboo in Chad, where she lives. It’s up to her single mother, Amina (Achouackh Abakar Souleymane), to find a solution, aided by a secret network of women. “I don’t want to be like you, Mum. They think you’re a loose woman,” says Maria, face turned away from the camera, to her mother. Amina, on the other hand, meets the film-maker’s gaze head-on.

2/6/2022,"Today in a nutshell: High winds put paid to the men’s downhill, Zoi Sadowski-Synnott secured an historic New Zealand gold and Kamila Valieva stunned on the ice Next up: There are medals yet to be won today in the women’s moguls and men’s single luge, and tomorrow we’ll see the first ever Olympic mixed team ski jumping competition  After one hour and 16 minutes of gruelling cross-country skiing, Alexander Bolshunov crossed the finish line carrying a Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) banner, some 71 seconds ahead of compatriot Denis Spitsov. Iivo Niskanen of Finland had been instrumental in setting up the breakaway for the three men. He held off a late double Norwegian challenge to claim bronze in the 15km + 15km men’s skiathlon. Zoi Sadowski-Synnott made history by winning New Zealand’s first-ever Winter Olympics gold, capturing the women’s slopestyle title with a dramatic final run that ended US dominance of the discipline. “I tried to think about it last night what it would mean if I managed to land my run and come away with gold, and honestly it feels unreal,” she said. Julia Marino of USA and Australia’s Tess Coady won silver and bronze, the first medals of these Games for their respective nations. Australian curling duo Tahli Gill and Dean Hewitt have had a rollercoaster of a day. They were originally told they were going home after a positive Covid test for Gill, only for health officials to say they could continue after all under “close contact” provisions. They then beat Switzerland 9-6 in the mixed doubles. Italy’s unbeaten run in the curling stretched to seven with victory over China. That guarantees the Italians a semi-final spot. Canada, Great Britain and Sweden have five wins apiece, and Norway sit in fifth place on four wins. One of those four is going to miss out, and this evening’s match between Team GB and Norway could prove pivotal. Patrick Roest of the Netherlands set a new Olympic record in the men’s 5,000m speed skating, then had to sit and watch another five pairs of skaters go to see if it was enough for gold. It wasn’t. Sweden’s Nils van der Poel shaved another 0.47 seconds off the record to snatch the win in the final race. Heartbreaking for Roest. We all missed the men’s downhill in the Alpine skiing. It was postponed because of high winds. And lots of people missed the opening ceremony in the US – NBC reported only 16 million people watched its live coverage, the lowest viewership in history. China’s first gold medal came late on Saturday in the chaotic mixed short skating relay. They had only appeared in the final after both the US and ROC were penalised in the semi-final. Also towards the close of play on Saturday, Urša Bogataj won the normal hill ski jumping for Slovenia, while Walter Wallberg of Sweden surprised Olympic champion and hot favourite Mikaël Kingsbury of Canada to win the men’s moguls in the freestyle skiing. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said it will proceed with a meeting with the former world No 1 doubles tennis player Peng Shuai, but details of the meeting will not be shared in advance. A dramatic shootout victory for China over Japan in the women’s ice hockey means that both these sides and the Czech Republic have now each won two matches and the three nations must be strong favourites to progress to the quarter-finals.

2/6/2022,"The war in Afghanistan did not end when US and UK troops left Kabul airport last year: it merely took a different, but still lethal, form. The response of President Joe Biden to the military humiliation inflicted on America by the Taliban has been a scorched earth policy designed to cause the maximum amount of economic damage to what was already one of the world’s poorest countries.  Prosecuting this war by other means involved freezing Afghan state assets held in New York. It meant the threat of sanctions against banks and other foreign companies doing business in Afghanistan. It has involved halting payments from the World Bank’s Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). It meant no emergency Covid-19 financial help from the International Monetary Fund. At the time, it was obvious this withdrawal of overseas financial aid – which accounted for almost half of Afghanistan’s gross domestic product in 2020 – would have a disastrous impact, and so it has proved. While the illicit opium-based trade is still going strong, the rest of the economy has pretty much collapsed. On average, firms have laid off 60% of their workers. The price of basic foodstuffs has risen by 40%. More than half the population is in need of humanitarian assistance and the poverty rate is in the region of 90%. By some distance, these are the highest levels of distress anywhere in the world. The UN children’s fund (Unicef) estimates more than a million Afghan children are at risk of dying from malnutrition or hunger-related disease. The statistics don’t capture the full picture, of people so desperate for food that they are selling their young daughters into marriage or having their organs removed for cash. What is clear is that rather than selectively targeting the Taliban, the US and its European allies are inflicting collective punishment on an entire country in the misguided belief that this is somehow upholding western values. Letting children go hungry does not uphold western values. Closing schools because teachers are going unpaid does not uphold estern values. Having lost the war, Washington is now losing the peace. Some humanitarian funding is arriving in Afghanistan through UN agencies and some of the leading development charities, but it is a fraction of the aid that was flowing in to keep schools open and the salaries of public sector workers before the Taliban takeover. Precise estimates of the scale of short-term help being provided are difficult because conditions are so chaotic it is hard to say whether the cash being airlifted in is actually getting to where it is needed. But it is probably around 10% of the $8.5bn (£6.2bn) a year that was coming in before the Taliban takeover. As one observer put it, the west’s approach has been to torpedo the economy and then provide a couple of leaky lifeboats to pick up the survivors. Afghanistan’s new rulers did not have an economic plan in August, and still don’t six months on. To an extent they don’t need one because they have a ready-made alibi: the economy is a mess because the Americans decided to make it so. There is not the slightest evidence that impoverishing the Afghan people is bringing regime change any closer. What it is doing is ensuring mass unemployment and widespread poverty: the perfect conditions to breed terrorism and generate an exodus of refugees. Biden has an obvious problem. It wouldn’t be a great look for the White House to go soft after so many American lives were lost during a two-decade war which ended in failure. It is hard, though, to escape the conclusion that there would have been a lot more of a fuss had Donald Trump won the election in 2020 and been pursuing the same policy. True, there has been some small easing of the sanctions to allow banks to do business for certain tightly controlled purposes without incurring sanctions. In December, the World Bank – which is deeply concerned about the deteriorating situation – transferred $280m from the ARTF to Unicef and the World Food programme. But there has no been real let-up. The Bank says it is in the hands of its shareholders. The IMF says it is guided by the international community. In reality, both are taking orders from the US Treasury and state department, and have effectively become instruments of American foreign policy. That the Taliban holds odious views is not in dispute. It would also be naive to imagine – given the abject confusion – that aid could be turned back on without a large chunk of it being squandered or stolen. The same, though, could be said of many other countries, yet only Afghanistan is being singled out for this brutal form of revenge. Eventually the following will happen. Afghanistan’s foreign-currency reserves will be unfrozen by the Americans. A floor will be put under the economy by an easing of sanctions so that non-humanitarian aid can be provided. The central bank will start to function. Discussions will be allowed to start with the IMF for a conditional bailout package. The World Bank will restart its programmes in an attempt to prevent the gains in human development it has financed over the past two decades being squandered. Strong, public pressure needs to be put on the US to make sure this happens sooner or later. China has rightly been condemned for its treatment of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, but there has been no similar mobilisation of international opinion against policies that are proving disastrous for millions of innocent, vulnerable Afghans. That needs to change because what the US is doing amounts to a humanitarian crime. And those who know what’s happening but keep silent are accessories to that crime.",News/Business,What the US is doing to Afghanistan amounts to a humanitarian crime | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/06/the-us-economic-war-on-afghanistan-amounts-to-a-humanitarian
2/6/2022,"Iconic photographs give this new musical play its title: a crouching priest waves a bloodstained white handkerchief as he moves along a city street, past armed soldiers, followed by men bearing a body in their arms. The priest is Father Edward Daly, the city is Derry, the body is 17-year-old John (“Jackie”) Duddy; the date is 30 January 1972, known since as Bloody Sunday. On that day, unarmed civil rights marchers, protesting against internment without trial, were shot at by British soldiers: 13 were killed; 15 wounded. The events of Bloody Sunday have been crafted into drama by composer Brian O’Doherty and playwright Liam Campbell (who died on 20 December last year, just before it went in to rehearsal). They are played out for us by a 34-strong cast of local professional and community actors, accompanied by a 12-strong orchestra, in the symbolically charged setting of the Guildhall, the intended destination never reached by the marchers.  On opening night, families of those who lost their lives are in the audience. Their past is brought into our present via the spirit of William McKinney (a finely measured performance from Warren McCook). Returning to the site where he fell, he relives his final hours. Boundaries between past and present blur: William addresses the audience directly; he and others come to sit among us, in the aisles. Under Kieran Griffiths’s direction, scenes flow, swift-paced, over, around and under the raised traverse stage bisecting the hall (designer: Ciaran Bagnall). The actors range easily through performance styles: intimate naturalism; rough comedy; epic monumentality. Tone changes are enhanced by musical shifts of emphasis from strings to percussion, also by movement transitions – Nadine Hegarty choreographs – between life-affirming, soldier-defying dances and tragedy-enhancing, death-dealt stillness. Created to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, the production only touches on the two official reports into army actions that day; it does not mention army killings leading up to it, nor IRA killings afterwards. A little more context here would be useful. That said, this performance for, by and about the people of Derry connects powerfully to wider experiences of loss and injustice. We see this, for instance, in William’s explaining, to his anxious fiancee, Elizabeth (perfectly pitched Sharon Duffy), why he feels he must join the march: “I won’t have done enough until the likes of you and me are not treated like second-class citizens in our own land… As Martin Luther King said, ‘We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream’.” Site-specific? Yes! But with themes that touch us all.

2/6/2022,"Astronauts Jo (Halle Berry) and Brian (Patrick Wilson) witness a freak accident, caused by an undulating mass of black matter. When they make it back to Earth minus a crew member, no one believes them; Brian is blamed and blacklisted from Nasa. Fast-forward 10 years, and KC (John Bradley from Game of Thrones), a lonely blogger with a cat named Fuzz Aldrin, gets in touch. The moon has fallen out of orbit; its debris will destroy the planet within weeks. It’s up to Brian and Jo to return to space and defeat what they call “the swarm”. There are too many characters and too many redemption arcs in this silly, overstuffed sci-fi. At least the eye-poppingly expensive special effects are cool. Apocalypse expert Roland Emmerich (The Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day) directs, drawing his premise from a conspiracy theory. “You’re telling me that the moon has the biggest cover-up in history?” says a baffled Jo, now the deputy director of Nasa.
