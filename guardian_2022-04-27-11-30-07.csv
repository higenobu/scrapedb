4/27/2022,"Southern California officials declared a water shortage emergency Tuesday, and adopted new unprecedented restrictions on outdoor watering that will impact millions of people living in Los Angeles, Ventura and San Bernardino counties. Metropolitan water district of southern California’s resolution will limit outdoor watering to just one day per week for district residents supplied by a stressed system of canals, pipelines, reservoirs and hydroelectric power plants called the State Water Project, which supplies water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta to 27 million Californians and 750,000 acres of farmland. The restrictions, which take effect in June, will severely limit how much water people can use to water their lawns or wash cars. “Due to the depth and duration of the current drought, Metropolitan cannot meet normal demands in the SWP dependent area with existing resources,” officials said in a document outlining the action, which targets “non-essential uses” that tax the declining water supply. Metropolitan, a water wholesaler, left many of the enforcement details up to member agencies, which act on more of a local level. Cities and water suppliers can opt out of the one-day rule, but must find appropriate solutions to curb water consumption and meet monthly reduced goals. If not, they could face steep fines from the water district. The move follows a reduction in deliveries from the State Water Project, as California braces for its third devastatingly dry year. With conditions only expected to worsen in the coming hot, dry, summer months, the state is expecting the water supply to be strained further. Following the driest start of the year on record for precipitation, state officials announced last month that they were cutting allocations from 15% to 5%. Meanwhile, the state’s snowpack – now at just 35% of normal for this time of year – is quickly disappearing. More than 95% of the state is experiencing severe drought according to the US drought monitor. Warming temperatures have exacerbated the conditions, spurring drying and “shifting the historical relationships between temperature, precipitation, and runoff”, officials said. “We are seeing conditions unlike anything we have seen before,” Adel Hagekhalil, the district’s general manager, told the Los Angeles Times. “We need serious demand reductions.” For the first time ever, the water district also asked for more water from the state, relying on a “never-before-invoked-provision” that provides for more than the 5% delivery if needed to supply essential health and human safety needs. The water district also requested additional volumes to prevent or suppress wildfires, and said it will work with member agencies and fire authorities on those deliveries as needed. But first, restrictions must be in place. The amount of water also must be returned to the system within five years, “thus creating a water supply debt that effectively trims future [allocations] and slows any storage recovery once the drought eases”, officials said. The water district included some exceptions to their limits on outdoor watering, including what’s needed to ensure trees and other perennials don’t perish before the restrictions are rescinded. Drip irrigation and other high-efficiency systems are also allowed as long as they don’t exceed what would be allotted during a one-day watering from a more wasteful source. These restrictions may increase if the supply wanes further. “Because of uncertainty in the drought’s persistence and the speed and scale of demand response”, officials said, authorizations are in place to prohibit “all non-essential outdoor irrigation as early as September 1”. The emergency water conservation program will also extend through June of next year unless conditions change enough for the board of directors to lift them.",News/US news,Parched southern California takes unprecedented step of restricting outdoor watering,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/26/california-outdoor-watering-restrictions-drought
4/27/2022,"A man with learning difficulties has been executed in Singapore for attempting to smuggle a small amount of heroin, despite repeated pleas for his life to be spared, in a case campaigners have described as a “tragic miscarriage of justice”. Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, a Malaysian national, was arrested in 2009, aged 21, for attempting to carry 43g of heroin – about three tablespoons – into Singapore. He was sentenced to death the following year, and then spent more than a decade on death row. His sentence horrified international rights groups, and prompted an outcry around the world, from EU representatives and UN experts, to the billionaire Richard Branson and actor and broadcaster Stephen Fry. Within Singapore, where support for the death penalty is high, the handling of his case has also prompted some to question the city state’s approach to drugs-related crimes. Nagaenthran had said he was coerced into carrying the package and did not know what was inside. His supporters say Nagaenthran had an IQ of 69, a level recognised as indicating a learning disability, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but that neither the investigation nor trial made any specific disability-related accommodations. Singapore’s chief justice, Sundaresh Menon, has previously stated that Nagaenthran had been “afforded due process”. Singapore’s government claims its severe drugs laws, including the death penalty, are the most effective deterrent against crime. In 2009, Nagaenthran was working as a welder in Johor Bahru in Malaysia, and desperately trying to find extra money to support his father, who was due to have a heart operation. Nahaenthran approached a man to ask for a loan of roughly £100, campaigners say, and was subsequently coerced into smuggling the package. His family have described him as sweet and caring but easily led and vulnerable. Nagaenthran’s mother, Panchalai Supermaniam, said his mental state had deteriorated during his time on death row, where he was kept in solitary confinement, and that he was at times incoherent. He did not seem to understand that he would be hanged, she said. Instead, he would talk about going home and eating his mother’s cooking. On Monday, hundreds of people in Singapore held a candlelight vigil at a park to protest against the planned execution. His mother filed a last-ditch legal challenge on Monday, seeking to halt the execution, but it was refused. Her motion argued that Nagaenthran may not have received a fair trial because the chief justice, who presided over his previous failed appeals, was attorney general at the time he was convicted in 2010, creating a potential conflict of interest. The court ruled on Tuesday that the motion was “devoid of merit”. Maya Foa, Reprieve’s director, said Nagaenthran Dharmalingam’s name would go down in history as “the victim of a tragic miscarriage of justice”. “From rushed hearings to intimidation of Nagen’s lawyers, this case has laid bare Singaporean authorities’ hollow claims about affording due process. But this is a watershed moment. With Nagen’s plight igniting unprecedented protests in the country calling for abolition of the death penalty, it’s clear the tide is turning in Singapore. “Capital punishment in Singapore disproportionately targets drug mules rather than the drug lords that traffic or manipulate them. Most of its victims are, like Nagen, poor, vulnerable and from marginalised communities. This is a broken system,” said Foa. On Wednesday morning, Nagaenthran’s brother Navin Kumar, 22, told Reuters by telephone the execution had been carried out. The funeral would be held in the town of Ipoh in Malaysia, he said. In a statement prior to Nagaenthran’s execution, UN human rights spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani expressed deep concern at the “rapid rise” in the number of execution notices issued this year in Singapore, mainly for drug-related offences.Last month, after a pause of more than two years in carrying out executions, Singapore executed Abdul Kahar bin Othman who was convicted of drug-related offences.
