2/15/2022,"Australian motorists may soon have to dig a little deeper to pay for their fuel after global prices rose to fresh seven-year highs amid mounting worries about a Russian invasion of Ukraine. Oil prices rose more than 2% overnight, with benchmark indices near the symbolic US$100 a barrel mark. Brent crude, for instance, rose 2.2% to US$96.48 in US trading before easing back slightly in Asia on Tuesday.  Australian’s retail petrol prices are already at record levels, averaging 176.9 cents a litre in the week to 13 February, according to the Australian Institute of Petroleum. Peter Khoury, the head of media at NRMA in New South Wales, expects average prices to rise to 180 cents a litre or higher in coming days, noting Brisbane prices had already reached 192 cents for unleaded. “It’s not going to be pretty,” he said. “It’s going to continue to go up.” Quite apart from any immediate disruptions to supply should Russia invade Ukraine, the likelihood of heavy sanctions being slapped on one of the world’s biggest oil producers would likely push oil prices higher. “There’s some real concern now that oil is going to breach $US100 per barrel,” Khoury said. “We’re hoping the average in Australia doesn’t hit $2 a litre but we’ll be monitoring it.” Robert Rennie, the head of Westpac’s financial markets strategy group, said “the market is pretty much 100% Ukraine-dependent near term”. “If we do see any further developments there, I can easily see US$120 for Brent,” he said. Singapore, where most of Australia’s fuel imports are sourced, is a good guide to what’s coming since there’s typically a week’s lag between changes in that market and Australia’s. Singapore’s current gasoil price “tells you to expect to be paying $1.70-plus on average in the next week or so on a wholesale basis” for fuel, Rennie said.

NRMA has its own app for NSW, as does its counterpart in Victoria – RACV. For Queensland drivers there is RACQ’s version, with similar offerings in other states. Governments, too, provide options, such as NSW’s fuel check, for drivers hunting for lower-priced fuel. Brent and other oil prices were higher a decade ago, topping $US125 a barrel in March 2012. During those years, however, the Australian dollar was much closer to parity if not higher with the US dollar, buffering local motorists from some of the impact. The Australian dollar is now trading a bit above 70 US cents although market economists mostly predict it will strengthen towards 80 US cents by the year’s end – provided there is not some major disruption to the global economy. Australia’s fuel demand has grown during the Covid pandemic save for a brief drop during the first wave when big users were disrupted, according to the latest energy audit published by the Australian National University. “Bulk diesel is used in a wide variety of industries, including agriculture, mining, construction and public transport, all of which have been relatively little affected, in terms of their level of activity, by the pandemic,” the audit said.

Similar shifts will take place in industry. “This is particularly relevant for Europe which is a large net importer of all fossil fuels,” Jotzo said. “Well over half of the EU’s total energy is imported. All European countries except Norway are net energy importers.” North-east Asia too relies heavily on energy imports, and while Australia is one of the world’s biggest exporters of coal and gas, it also imports about 37% of the total energy used, Jotzo said. “Australia’s ongoing domestic reserve of diesel and petrol is relatively small, and refining capacity is limited, so we are potentially vulnerable to disruptions in shipping fuels to Australia,” he said. “The more transport is electrified and thereby powered by local energy, the less of a risk this is.”",News/Business,‘Not going to be pretty’: Australian petrol prices on track for new high,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/15/not-going-to-be-pretty-australian-petrol-prices-on-track-for-new-high
2/15/2022,"I am 50 and my wife is a few years younger. We have been together for more than a decade and have three wonderful and noisy children. I believe we are in one of the sweetest phases of our relationship: we don’t often fight, we sleep without interruption most nights, we care about each other deeply and we share our feelings. The issue is that our sex drives are unsynchronised. I would like to have sex more often (once a week) and she prefers to wait a couple of weeks (or a month). Lately, she feels our sex moments are a toll she needs to pay to keep me satisfied or happy. And I feel she has sex just for me. We tried some sex toys and it worked well when we used them, but this doesn’t give her a desire to have sex more often. I tried to talk to her, but she refused to continue talking, arguing that I make her feel that sex is an obligation not an optional pleasure inside the marriage. What can I do to gain sex appeal? It will be important to find a way to discuss this with your wife without her feeling blamed, or that you have marital expectations. Try to truly understand how she feels. She may have physical, psychological or medical reasons for lowered desire, or it may just be that you two – understandably – cannot manage to find enough privacy. Bear in mind that many people are experiencing depression as a result of Covid fears and restrictions, and depression can lower desire. Focusing on children can really affect a couple’s ability to kindle erotic contact, and this has been even more true during the confinement of the past two years. Be creative – individually and in partnership with your wife – in finding strategies for greater relaxation, more private time, and a prioritisation of love-making.

2/15/2022,"If such a thing as a Lazarus-like figure exists in hip-hop, it’s Curtis James Jackson III – better known as 50 Cent. The 46-year-old Queens, New York native appeared poised to pull off a familiar progression from drug dealer to gangsta rapper after signing with Columbia Records in 2000. But just as his debut album was due to be released, Jackson was attacked outside his grandmother’s home and shot nine times at close range, the injuries to his face resulting in a swollen tongue and a slurred voice. Amazingly, Jackson walked out of hospital two weeks later, with a true sense of purpose and a mind set on packing muscle on to his 6ft frame – a physical transformation that laid a foundation for a machiavellian persona. His immediate career prospects dipped after the shooting. Columbia dropped him, and other labels backed away, not wanting to entangle themselves with an artist whose lyrics rang so true. Undeterred, Jackson, a prolific writer and producer, gave his tracks away, inaugurating the era of the record industry-disrupting mixtape. The immensely popular giveaways caught the attention of Eminem, who introduced him to Dr Dre, who quickly signed him to his imprint, Interscope. In 2003, 50 Cent made his commercial debut with Get Rich or Die Tryin’; the lead single, In Da Club, smashed the Billboard record for the most listened-to radio song within a week.  After that came 14 Grammy nominations and a 2010 win, a bespoke label, G-Unit, and more commercial prosperity. It seemed as if he might dominate radio for a decade. And he nearly did until he picked a sales fight with a college dropout with a backpack full of beats named Kanye, someone with his own creation myth – a car accident that broke his jaw. That seemed to hasten Jackson’s next pivot from gangsta rapper to business mogul. He published a book with The 48 Laws of Power author Robert Greene called The 50th Law. He made a fortune after being an early investor in Vitaminwater but in 2015 declared bankruptcy. He dabbled in film-making, mostly producing work that either featured him in the cast or was explicitly about him. Television looked like the last place he would end up; the medium seems almost too tame for him. (It’s not as though Jackson, for all his action star ambitions, was known for having a softer side like Will Smith or LL Cool J.) Black crime dramas seemed better suited to the big screen, where “hood films” such as New Jack City (starring Wesley Snipes and Ice-T) and Belly (with Nas and DMX) achieved rarefied cult status. Still, Jackson couldn’t shake the urge to develop a small-screen project that might serve as a vehicle for music too taboo for Apple Music and the like. But it wasn’t until he connected with The Good Wife writer Courtney A Kemp that the idea evolved into a pitch about a Michael Corleone type caught between two worlds. A green light from Starz, then a repeats-heavy channel that sat below HBO and Showtime in the prestige cable tier, didn’t exactly set up the series for an extended run. Nor did the pilot’s lack of household names besides Jackson, who was ultimately cast as a supporting character who doesn’t immediately appear – and even then only occasionally. But when Power premiered in 2014 it quickly became a ratings hit. Black and Latinx viewers in particular bought subscriptions en masse to follow the exploits of James St Patrick (Omari Hardwick), AKA Ghost, a New York drug kingpin caught in a romantically complicated cat-and-mouse game with his high-school sweetheart, an assistant US attorney. By the time of its third season, the show was the second most watched on cable, behind only Game of Thrones. Impressively, that audience was achieved without much in the way of promotion or major acclaim for the series’ actors and writers. That success didn’t only justify five more seasons, it spawned four more spin-off series (or “books”). Power Book II: Ghost explores the life of St Patrick’s son Tariq, Power Book III: Raising Kanan is a 90s-set prequel depicting the early years of Jackson’s character, while the recently released Power Book IV: Force follows St Patrick’s right-hand man Tommy Egan and the forthcoming Power Book V: Influence concerns a crooked councilman. Increasingly, Jackson has become prominent on screen while maintaining a distinct presence behind the camera, not least as a music supervisor and performer on the franchise’s soundtracks. Power’s spin-off structure takes David Simon’s The Wire and stretches into a Marvel-like universe that now forms the cornerstone of Starz’s programming. All the while Jackson has emerged as a super-producer in the style of Law & Order creator Dick Wolf, and Starz made their relationship with him official in 2018 with a four-year, $150m development deal. But, of course, 50 being 50, he won’t hesitate to hop on social media and needle his partners until he gets his way. But the public scrutiny cuts both ways. Fans revolted when Jackson remixed the title song he wrote and performed for the show, Big Rich Town, replacing the singer of the song’s hook Joe with Trey Songz. (He changed it back after one episode.) What’s more, Kemp has proved to be every bit as ruthless as Jackson in her role as Power’s showrunner, unafraid of killing off beloved characters. And why not? The bold moves defend the universe against critics who might feel inclined to write off some episodes as too soapy. It hasn’t cost the Power franchise its following. If anything, the bandwagon is getting bigger. In addition to the two new Power books, Starz also picked up BMF (Black Mafia Family) – Jackson’s Detroit-based crime drama – for a second season, and greenlit another series, Queen Nzinga, about a Dora Milaje-esque warrior, that he likened to the movie 300. And all of that is besides two other series he’s developing, one around his rap feud with the Game, and the other about Snoop Dogg’s 1993 murder case (he was acquitted). So far, the biggest setback he’s had on TV was the cancellation of his ABC series For Life (about a falsely incarcerated man who becomes an attorney behind bars), and even that earned two seasons. The success would be remarkable even if Jackson hadn’t nearly been left for dead two decades ago. It seems there’s no end to the 50 Cent extended universe.

2/15/2022,"When Sporting parted company with their manager, Silas, on 4 March 2020, it was easy to wonder when the upheaval would end. The Lisbon club sat fourth in the Primeira Liga, four points off third-placed Braga and 20 behind the leaders, Porto, and were about to appoint their fourth manager of the season. He would be the sixth of the presidency of Frederico Varandas, who had taken over in September 2018 from the controversial Bruno de Carvalho. Sporting remained haunted by the notorious training-ground attack of May 2018, when 50 hooligans – incensed by poor results – stormed the premises to beat up players and staff. In May of last year, a Portuguese court made 41 convictions for assault and threatening behaviour, with nine men receiving five-year prison sentences. De Carvalho was cleared of having helped to mastermind the episode. Sporting said it had left “an indelible mark on the club and its fans”.  Varandas and his sporting director, Hugo Viana, a former Newcastle midfielder, had to get the managerial appointment right. The climate was edgy and not only because the pandemic was coming. It was accurate to describe the relationship between the board and supporters as awful. What Varandas and Viana did was risky. They turned to Rúben Amorim, a former Portugal midfielder, who had spent much of his playing career at Sporting’s crosstown rivals, Benfica. He was 35 years old and a veteran of two months of top-flight management with Braga, albeit spectacular ones. He had won eight and drawn one of his nine league matches and won the Taça da Liga, beating Sporting in the semi-final and Porto in the final. Sporting had to pay the €10m release clause in Amorim’s contract and it only added to the pressure on him and the club to make it work. Just under two years on, with Sporting ready to host Manchester City in the Champions League last 16 first leg on Tuesday, the decision has come to look inspired. It is Sporting’s second appearance at this stage of the competition and stemmed from their stunning domestic title success of last season – their first since 2001-02. They also won the Taça da Liga, which they have retained this time out. They sit second in the league, six points behind Porto, after a 2-2 away draw against them last Friday – a game that ended with a mass brawl. There were five red cards, three for Sporting. Amorim has become a superstar in Portugal, his leadership style marked by strength of personality and charisma, the ability to encourage players to buy in rather than ruling by decree. Sporting have wanted to follow a particular path for some years only to lack a manager to push them along it. In Amorim, who started his coaching career at the third-tier side Casa Pia and went to Braga B before being promoted to the first team, they have found the ideal fit. The Sporting project has been shaped by three guidelines: the recruitment of a small number of experienced players (mainly from outside Portugal), a drive to sign younger ones from the domestic league and the promotion of academy talent. What the onset of the pandemic and the suspension of football in Portugal for three months allowed Amorim to do was bed in and understand the dressing room, including some of the weaknesses. When the championship resumed in June 2020, Sporting won five and drew three of 10 games to finish fourth – only the fourth time this century they had been outside the top three. But Amorim had begun to formulate a plan for the market with Viana, one of his closest friends, and to make progress in one of the priority areas. Amorim gave debuts to a number of academy youngsters in those final matches, including Nuno Mendes and Matheus Nunes, who were 17 and 21. They would be important parts of the title-winning team, particularly the former at left wing-back in Amorim’s 3-4-3, which is compact without the ball, quick and direct with it; defined by aggressive pressing. Mendes would get a move to Paris Saint-Germain last summer in a deal that took the Spain winger Pablo Sarabia the other way on a season’s loan. Nunes, born in Brazil but now a Portuguese citizen and international for them, has locked down a starting spot in midfield this season. The Sporting academy is famous for having produced Luís Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo and the club want roughly a third of Amorim’s squad to have come up from it. Amorim wants that, too. He is obsessed by blooding homegrown players and he has been singularly unafraid to pitch them in. Gonçalo Inácio, now 20, a central defender with a burgeoning reputation, is a good example. He has been guided by the talismanic captain, Sebastián Coates, who plays in the centre of the back three. Amorim brought the midfielder João Palhinha back to the club in the summer of 2020; the academy product had been out on loan, latterly with the manager at Braga, and he was key to the title win. Palhinha has been tipped for a Premier League move at the end of the season. The right wing-back Ricardo Esgaio is another academy product to have returned and hopes are high for the teenage wing-backs Gonçalo Esteves and Nazinho, and the 22-year-old midfielder Daniel Bragança. A youthful star addition has been the right wing-back Pedro Porro on a two-year loan from Manchester City. He is eligible to face his parent club. Amorim would instigate something of a clearout in his first transfer window, moving on, among others, Marcos Acuña, Wendel and Luciano Vietto. It was who he brought in that made the difference. The goalkeeper Antonio Adán and the centre-half Zou Feddal – seasoned professionals – arrived from Atlético Madrid and Real Betis respectively, while the experienced midfielder João Mário joined on a season’s loan from Internazionale. He had been a youth player at Sporting. Paulinho, a 29-year-old striker, would come from Braga in the winter window of last year. But if there was one signing that served as a spark it came from the project’s other track – the trawl of Portuguese football and clubs of lower stature. Pedro Gonçalves, who is now 23, had starred for the promoted Famalicão in 2019‑20 after they had taken him from the Wolves academy for a nominal fee. The Premier League club did negotiate a sell-on clause. Playing as a No 8, Gonçalves had helped Famalicão to a sixth-placed finish and he was named as the league’s young player of the year. He was to touch the stars after going to Sporting, who paid €6.5m to Famalicão for 50% of his economic rights. Redeployed by Amorim as a wide forward who cuts inside, he scored 23 goals in 32 league games, winning the Golden Boot, another young player of the year award and inclusion in the team of the season and the Portugal squad for the European Championship finals. Sporting had found their heir to Bruno Fernandes, who went to Manchester United in January 2020. This season, Gonçalves has had injuries but he still has 13 goals, including two in the 3-1 home win over Borussia Dortmund that secured Sporting’s passage from the Champions League group stage. He extended his contract last October, with Sporting raising his release clause to €80m, and the feeling within the club is the boy who feels no pressure is destined for a massive move, although not this summer. Some of the big clubs in England and Germany have inquired about him – not to talk numbers, rather to begin their due diligence. Sporting, meanwhile, made a future-proofing move of their own in January, signing Marcus Edwards, the erstwhile Tottenham wonderkid, for €7.5m from Vitória Guimarães. Sporting are aware it will be impossible to keep Sarabia, whose gross salary is about €8m; their next-highest earner grosses €3m. The plan is for Edwards to learn the ropes before replacing Sarabia in the starting lineup next season. Sporting are realistic enough to know they are big underdogs against City. The journey under Amorim has given them hope.",Sport/Football,Sporting success: how Portuguese champions plotted their way back | David Hytner,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/15/sporting-lisbon-manchester-city-champions-league
2/15/2022,"In 1998, Sir Paul Condon, the then Metropolitan police commissioner, wrote a letter to the Macpherson inquiry into the response to the murder of Stephen Lawrence. “Racism in the police is much more than ‘bad apples’,” he wrote. “The debate about defining this evil … is cathartic in leading us to recognise that it can occur almost unknowingly, as a matter of neglect, in an institution. I acknowledge the danger of institutionalisation of racism. However, labels can cause more problems than they solve.” In one sense, Condon’s words were insightful – his rejection of the “bad apple” argument strikes a contrast with Cressida Dick’s words about her own officers years later. But the fact that Dick would eventually be forced to resign amid a similarly fractious debate about problems of culture and institutional behaviour within the Met shows just how much work there is still to be done.  Dick was internally popular, but ultimately failed to convince Sadiq Khan that she would address the Met’s problems with the urgency and on the scale that was required – particularly in light of the recent Charing Cross report by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. That contained shocking details of police officers sharing racist and misogynistic messages with each other. But the sad truth is that it also revealed nothing new. It was released after a period of consultation with the Met and related to investigations that were several years old. In April 2021, the director general of the IOPC had cause to write to the National Police Chiefs’ Council raising a concern that they were seeing cases that “may be indicative of broader cultural issues within some police forces”. The letter referred to a number of cases in which officers shared inappropriate images or content on social media that was “racist, misogynistic or homophobic”. It drew the NPCC’s attention to the fact that often the cases would start by “looking at the conduct of one officer but were then broadened to include the actions of others because inappropriate content was shared widely”. A corresponding statement was placed on the IOPC’s website, listing examples of cases the regulator had seen since replacing the IPCC in 2018. This referred to cases in the Met, south Wales, Cheshire, Warwickshire and Kent. The highlighted Met case dated back to December 2020 and dealt with several officers receiving “final written warnings for gross misconduct after sharing text messages which contained offensive references to people with disabilities and jokes about rape, paedophilia, racism, and homophobia.” There was very little press coverage of that letter and statement. The NPCC responded with a general commitment to “actively [work] with the IOPC to put further guidance and safeguards in place” around use of social media and messaging. There was no public outcry, and no push for the highlighted forces to respond with substantive measures they would take to deal with those problems. Yet those cases identified the same poisonous culture that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to serve as a police officer despite co-workers nicknaming him “the rapist” due to his outrageous behaviour; and that allowed two police officers not only to take photographs of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman’s bodies, but also to share them with impunity in WhatsApp groups with colleagues. Dick’s resignation has symbolic significance. The Met is England and Wales’ largest police force and it serves the most diverse population in Britain. Not only does it have regional responsibility, it holds national portfolios and heads counter-terrorism. The direction of policing in the Met can have a huge impact on national policing. However, substantive transformation requires more than a change at the top. It needs commitment from all levels of officers; scrutiny from the press; public engagement and demand for change; and the mandate from the Home Office. So far, frankly, those elements have not come together for a long enough period to apply the required pressure. This is despite the fact that trust and confidence among certain groups is extremely low. In December 2021, a YouGov survey found that more than half of Britons from minority ethnic backgrounds no longer trust the police; in October 2021, YouGov found that 47% of women and 40% of men said trust in police had decreased since the murder of Sarah Everard. Instilling confidence entails a willingness to call cultural and institutional problems exactly what they are and then doing something radical about it. This doesn’t detract from the fact that many officers are in the job for positive reasons, or that some progress has been made in these areas. Engaging with criticism of an institution does not undermine it, it legitimises it and keeps it relevant. It shows a willingness to be held accountable. Since last August, I’ve been in post as chair of the independent scrutiny and oversight board for the police’s action plan on inclusion and race. My role is to hold all 43 police chiefs across England and Wales accountable while they, with the College of Policing, develop and implement an action plan to create an “anti-racist police service” – their words. The plan focuses in particular on the experiences of Black communities with the police. By committing to it, each police chief accepts the need to deal with these problems. That acceptance reflects an acknowldgement that racial disparities are present in most areas of policing, and that conscious steps need to be taken to deal with them. The initiative was announced in June 2020; however, we’re now in February 2022 and discussions about institutional racism remain ongoing. I hope that this resignation, and the clear gauntlet that has been thrown down by the mayor of London, will provide the next Met chief with the mandate to push for reform internally, while externally acknowledging the extent of the issue. It shows that the elected officials really do have the power to hold police chiefs to account. I hope that other chiefs will be galvanised and inspired to undertake the charge – some of them already have. Dick’s resignation marks an opportunity for us, the public, and the media to make sure police reform stays at the top of the agenda.

2/15/2022,"UK wage growth picked up in January as job vacancies hit a new record high, but pay failed to keep pace with the highest inflation rate for three decades. The Office for National Statistics said the annual growth rate for average total pay, including bonuses, increased to 4.3% in the three months to December, up from a rate of 4.2% in the three months to November.  The rate was boosted by bonus payments in December, with the strongest pay growth for workers in finance, insurance and the property industry. Regular wage growth excluding bonuses dropped by 0.1 percentage points to 3.7% over the same period. The performance beat the expectations of City economists for total wage growth of 3.8% and a rise of 3.6% for regular pay. However, taking into account inflation – which is at the highest level since the early 1990s amid a dramatic increase in household energy costs and wider cost of living crisis – real pay fell on the year by 0.1%. Wages excluding bonuses fell by 0.8%. Sam Beckett, head of economic statistics at the ONS, said: “After taking account of recent rises in consumer prices, real total pay fell in the year to October-December 2021, despite a strong recovery in bonuses.” It came as the number of job vacancies across the UK increased in January to a fresh record high of almost 1.3 million after two consecutive monthly falls when some employers paused their hiring plans amid increased uncertainty over the economic outlook due to Omicron. In a sign of rising confidence among firms, the number of employees on UK company payrolls increased by 108,000 in January to a record 29.5 million.

2/15/2022,"A jury member has been discharged nearly a week into the four-week trial of a Northern Territory police officer charged with murder. Soon after the seventh day of Constable Zachary Rolfe’s trial started in the Northern Territory supreme court on Tuesday, Justice John Burns closed the court to discuss a matter related to the jury.  About an hour later, Burns said a juror had been discharged, and one of the reserve jury members would be used. “Both the accused and the Crown have accepted the assurances given by the remaining members of the jury that they are able to address the issues in this trial in an unbiased fashion,” he said. “So on that basis the trial will proceed.” No further information was given about the reason for the decision. Rolfe, 30, is charged with murdering Kumanjayi Walker while trying to arrest him in the remote community of Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs, on 9 November, 2019. About 7.20pm, Rolfe and his colleague Constable Adam Eberl confronted Walker in a house in the community, the court has heard. Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, then stabbed Rolfe with a pair of surgical scissors shortly before being shot by Rolfe three times. The second and third shots are subject to the murder charge. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty to murder and two alternate charges. On Tuesday, the trial also heard for the first time from two other officers who were deployed from Alice Springs along with Rolfe on the day of the shooting. Both officers, like Rolfe, had served in the defence force before joining the NT police, the court heard. Constable James Kirstenfeldt gave evidence that he travelled with Rolfe from Alice Springs to Yuendumu on the afternoon of 9 November 2019. He said he had not seen an email sent by Sergeant Julie Frost, the officer in charge of Yuendumu station, about the operational plan for the Alice Springs officers once they arrived in the community. According to that plan, which has been tendered in evidence, Frost requested assistance from the Immediate Response Team (IRT), a unit based in Alice Springs that had tactical capabilities, and from the police dog squad, to deal with multiple issues in the community in the context of insufficient local resources. These issues included increased break-ins, including at the homes of local medical staff, which had prompted them to tell Frost they planned to evacuate from Yuendumu, and the need to arrest Walker, a fugitive who had threatened police with an axe three days earlier. The email referred to a plan to arrest Walker on the morning of 10 November, the day after the officers arrived in Yuendumu. But Kirstenfeldt gave evidence he had never seen the email, nor been shown a printout of it. He said a five-minute briefing that Frost conducted for the officers shortly before they left Yuendumu station mostly related to the IRT officers setting up the police radios at the station, and not on the detail of that email. Frost told them she did not use the radios and could not connect them to a territory-wide system, Kirstenfeldt said, but the officers did not want to deploy into the field without them. About 15 minutes after the IRT members left Yuendumu station, Walker had been shot dead. Senior Constable Adam Donaldson, a trained dog handler who also travelled to Yuendumu on 9 November, arrived at the station before the IRT members. He told the court Frost gave him a printout of the operational plan, and then discussed its contents with him. Donaldson said it was clear to him the priority on 9 November was to assist with the unlawful entries at the nurses quarters, and then look for Walker early the next morning. But he agreed with David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, that the plan also referred to him and the IRT members not going on duty until 11pm – four hours after they were ready to deploy – and there was no intelligence about where Walker actually was, despite the reference to an operation to arrest him the following morning. Senior Aboriginal community police officer Derek Williams also gave evidence on Tuesday that he had seen Walker earlier on 9 November 2019 attending a funeral of a family member – the first time the trial has heard evidence about where Walker was between threatening police on 6 November 2019 and being killed. The court has previously heard family members believed Walker had escaped from an alcohol treatment centre in Alice Springs and removed an electronic monitoring device, breaching the conditions of his parole, because he wanted to attend the funeral. It has also heard that police considered arresting Walker at the funeral but decided against it, and that police had told Walker’s family to urge him to hand himself in. Williams and another police officer who had previously arrested Walker, Acting Sgt Felix Alefaio, both gave evidence that in their experience Walker was not violent towards police. According to the plan, Alefaio was expected to be involved in the arrest of Walker so that he could help the IRT members identify him. He said in his evidence that he was in Yuendumu station when the IRT members arrived from Alice Springs. He recalled Frost telling Rolfe and Kirstenfeldt to do patrols in the community on the night of 9 November until midnight, before being relieved by the other IRT pair, and that Walker would be arrested the following morning after police met back up at the station about 5am.
