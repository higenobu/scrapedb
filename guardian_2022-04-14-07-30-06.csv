4/14/2022,"The pandemic sent Americans’ demand for pets soaring as a growing number of people sought out a canine companion. Now, Google is going after an alleged fraudster for running a fake puppy scam that exploited people’s desire for “personal gain”. In the new lawsuit, filed on Monday, the company accused the Cameroon-based defendant of using a network of fake websites, Google Voice phone numbers and Gmail accounts to pretend to sell purebred puppies, including basset hounds and maltipoos, that didn’t exist. Google says the alleged fraudster is responsible for “perpetrating a puppy fraud scheme to exploit the Covid-19 pandemic for personal gain, while taking advantage of unsuspecting and vulnerable victims”. In one instance, a victim paid Noel $700 in “electronic gift cards” to buy a puppy. After sending the gift card information through Google Voice accounts, the victim was asked for an additional $1,500n to deliver the puppy. According to the complaint, the puppy never arrived. The lawsuit, reportedly the first of its kind, says the scam used “alluring photos” of the puppies as well as “testimonials from supposedly satisfied customers” to trick unsuspecting buyers. Lawyers argued the scam caused both “emotional harm and financial loss” to victims, as well as “financial harms to Google, including by interfering with Google’s relationships with its users (and potential users)” and “harming Google’s reputation”. AARP, an interest group focusing on issues affecting people over the age of 50, was the first to flag the complaints to Google. The company uncovered a network of linked email addresses, voice numbers and websites that all promised puppies – with no deliveries. In a blogpost about the lawsuit, Google says the scam disproportionately targeted older Americans, who can be more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Federal authorities estimate older people are scammed out of $650m a year. The scam highlights two intersecting threads of pandemic culture: an increased demand for pups and more fraud. The Better Business Bureau recently announced that pet scams now make up 35% of all online shopping scams reported to them. According to the lawsuit, puppy scams increased by 165% in the US from 2019 to 2021. Meanwhile, according to Google Search Trends, searches for “adopt a dog” spiked at the start of the pandemic as people spent more time at home. By the end of 2020, 70% of Americans reported owning a pet. Americans have about 108 million dogs (one dog for every three people in this country) – a number that rose by 9 million during the pandemic. And of the pets adopted during Covid, the ASPCA reports that 90% of dogs and 85% of cats are still in their new homes. Google says it investigates and refers cases to law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Justice. Another pet scam case from late 2021 ended when a Cameroonian citizen pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud for his role in a scheme to trick American consumers into paying fees for pets that were never delivered, and for using the Covid-19 crisis as an excuse to extract higher fees from victims. One victim lost $9,100 trying to buy a dog for her mother in March 2020. Others, including two victims in their 50s, lost smaller sums. Six victims, from Pennsylvania, Texas and Iowa, were defrauded, according to the criminal complaint. Experts warn never to buy an animal online: instead, meet the pet in person (or on a video call) before paying any money, and do your research about what a pet should cost and who the seller is. Or contact your local shelter or rescue groups and bring home a real-life dog in need of a human companion.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Puppy scam: Americans desperate for a canine companion paid for imaginary pups ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/13/puppy-scam-americans-canine-companion-basset-hound-pups
4/14/2022,"People seeking asylum in the UK will be flown 4,500 miles to Rwanda as part of a government crackdown on unauthorised migrants to be announced by Boris Johnson. The prime minister is expected to announce a range of measures including putting the navy in charge of Channel operations from Friday and a new reception centre to hold people attempting to enter the UK to aid ending the practice of housing asylum seekers in hotels. Priti Patel, the home secretary, travelled to the central African country on Wednesday after finalising a “migration and economic development partnership”. The initiative comes as the prime minister prepares to disclose further plans on Thursday to break up the business model of people-smuggling gangs and increase UK operations in the Channel. Referring to UK’s referendum vote to leave the EU, he will say: “We cannot sustain a parallel illegal system. Our compassion may be infinite, but our capacity to help people is not. “The British people voted several times to control our borders. Not to close them, but to control them.” The deal with Rwanda, which will reportedly cost an initial £120m, follows three years of promises by Patel to outsource asylum processing to third countries and failures to strike deals with Albania and Ghana. It is understood that the deal – described as “unworkable and unethical” by Labour – will mean that people seeking asylum in the UK will face the possibility of being flown to a camp in Rwanda. Migrants will reportedly have their asylum claims processed in the east African country and be encouraged to settle there. The Times said the move will apply only male migrants. A statement from No 10 said: “The home secretary will set out further details on a world-first migration and economic development partnership signed by the home secretary, Priti Patel, with Rwanda – one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa which is recognised globally for its record on welcoming and integrating migrants.” According to a 2020 Human Rights Watch report, detainees in the country suffer from arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and torture in official and unofficial facilities. The government has not yet explained how much the deal with Rwanda will cost the UK taxpayer; whether any camp at which asylum seekers are interned will be under UK jurisdiction; and how the UK government will seek to oversee the welfare of migrants. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, said the Rwandan proposal is a “shameful announcement meant to distract from Boris Johnson’s recent law-breaking. “It is an unworkable, unethical and extortionate policy that would cost the UK taxpayer billions of pounds during a cost of living crisis and would make it harder not easier to get fast and fair asylum decisions,” she said. The United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, said it is waiting to see the bilateral agreement but expressed concern at the plans to send asylum seekers abroad. “UNHCR does not support the externalisation of asylum states’ obligations. This includes measures taken by States to transfer asylum seekers and refugees to other countries, with insufficient safeguards to protect their rights, or where this leads to the shifting rather than the sharing of responsibilities to protect refugees,” a spokesperson commented. Reacting to the government’s planned crackdown, Enver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said the government wanted to criminalise people for taking the wrong path to safety by reaching the UK. “The government is choosing control and punishment above compassion despite the fact its own data shows that two thirds of men, women and children arriving in small boats come from countries where war and persecution has forced them from their homes. “We urge this government to immediately rethink its plans which are in such stark contrast to what every Conservative prime minister since Churchill has sought to do by providing a fair hearing on British soil for those who claim asylum,” he said. The first reception centre, which will be modelled on the practice in Greece, will be a former RAF base in Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire. Councils will also be given additional funding to disperse destitute migrants. The government has so far failed to pass the necessary legislation to place so-called offshoring on the statute books. The nationality and borders bill which will enable asylum seekers to be processed abroad, has not yet gained royal assent. The Rt Revd Paul Butler, the Bishop of Durham, who proposed amendments to the bill, said: “Asylum seekers who arrive on our shores are our international responsibility and should be dealt with in our own land with the human dignity to which they are entitled. “There are many questions about the parameters of any offshoring proposal that remain unanswered, including the financial cost, but primarily around the question of dignity.” Denmark has previously struck a deal with the Rwandan government to accept recent migrants. A memorandum of understanding was signed between the two countries last summer – but it remains unclear whether the Danish government has so far sent anyone to Rwanda. Ministers led by Patel have seen Australian-style offshore processing centres – to which migrants would be flown within seven days of arriving in the UK – as a key potential deterrent to stem the record surge in Channel crossings. Last month, she recruited the former Australian foreign minister Alexander Downer to review the country’s border force, weeks after he had urged the UK to adopt a hardline on boat migrants. Last year, Australian government figures showed that the country spent £461m processing 239 refugees and asylum seekers held offshore. More than 4,600 people have arrived in the UK by small boat crossings since the start of the year, according to figures collected by PA news agency. On Wednesday, women and young children were among the passengers of several boatloads of people who crossed the Channel. People in lifejackets and blankets have been seen arriving at Dover on Border Force vessels as well as at Dungeness aboard an RNLI lifeboat.",News/UK news,Priti Patel finalises plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/13/priti-patel-finalises-plan-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda
4/14/2022,"It was fraught, it was suffocating, it was full-blooded – entirely as billed. And for Manchester City, it came down not to whether they could add to their first-leg lead in this Champions League quarter-final but whether they could hold on. It is difficult to remember Pep Guardiola’s swashbucklers being pinned inside their own half for so long but that was precisely what happened for the entirety of the second period. They had imposed themselves in the first-half but it was a different story after the interval, Atlético Madrid – urged on by a noisy and partisan crowd – choking them, forced them back, asking uncomfortable questions. Could Atlético make the breakthrough? The answer was no. Despite a few heart-in-mouth moments, City kept the back door shut and it seemed entirely in keeping with the volcanic currents that the tie ended in a bench-emptying melee after Felipe, already booked in the first half, went into Phil Foden and kicked him again. Felipe would eventually be sent off, after the warring factions were prised apart, but all City cared about was the result. Gündogan almost nicked it for them at the very end. City’s Champions League dream remains alive. The prize was a semi-final meeting with Real Madrid, the Spanish league leaders having advanced 24 hours previously after what was an epic against Chelsea across town. It had to be said that the expectation of another classic was low at kick-off time, mainly because of what had happened in the first leg – when Atlético did not muster a shot – and also how Diego Simeone had said that he would not alter his approach. Simeone’s idea was simply to be tighter, quicker, more precise, better. Guardiola had to find the correct balance. It has been a difficult season for Atlético, their league title defence long since over – they sit fourth in the table, one point clear of Real Betis in fifth – but they continue to know their way around this competition. It was a sixth quarter-final appearance in nine seasons for them. Guardiola’s watchword had been focus. The atmosphere pulsed, the stadium packed and noisy, shrill whistles for every City spell of possession. It had been the same when the visiting players took the knee before kick-off, which was jarring. Atlético brought the hustle at the outset and the key for City was always going to be whether they could remain composed on the ball and play their way out of trouble. When Kyle Walker, under pressure early on, sent a loose ball into touch and the crowd howled, Guardiola applauded like a maniac, hands high above his head. He wanted his team to enjoy having possession; not to be intimidated. The first half was measured in one-on-one duels, the first flashpoint coming when Felipe jumped into the back of Foden as they contested an aerial battle, the centre-half cleaning out his opponent with a ferocious upper-body barge. Foden lay motionless for a worrying period before rising after treatment, bloodied and bandaged. Remarkably, Felipe avoided a booking, although that soon changed when he went through the back of Kevin De Bruyne. Atlético wanted to leave a few calling cards. For City, it was a test of nerve. City got on to the front foot as the half wore on, Atlético’s initial surge having ebbed. Guardiola’s players began to work them around, showing their authority, and the thought occurred that it stood to be a test of the home team’s stamina. The visitors had gone close early on from a corner, John Stones making a firm headed connection but failing to keep the attempt down. They created the big chance of the half in the 30th minute, Riyad Mahrez sparking it with a beautiful pass inside the full-back for the advancing Walker. Mahrez was in the mood, all easy balance and dancing feet. Walker crossed and, when Foden laid off from beyond the far post, Gündogan had the close-range shooting opportunity. He hit the post and his header on the rebound was blocked by Felipe. At least Atlético got a shot away before the interval, although it was only one and Geoffrey Kondogbia’s 35th minute deflected effort from distance was entirely routine for Ederson. The needle never seemed far from the surface, Simeone demanding a yellow card for Stones – and not getting one – after the defender hauled back João Félix, whose menace was obvious. But the equation for City remained the same in the second half. Remain calm and assertive, and do not make any mistakes. Atlético stepped higher upon the restart, bringing the aggression once more and they had flickers in front of goal, which the home crowd were ultra quick to get behind. Renan Lodi’s cross was just too far in front of Félix, the striker headed over from a Marcos Llorente centre and Antoine Griezmann was narrowly off target from the edge of the area. The tide had turned, even the commanding Rodri getting robbed in possession, and City struggled to get up the pitch. De Bruyne appeared to be limping and Guardiola replaced him with Raheem Sterling, the hope being that he could get something to stick up front. Atlético pressed on, City happy to preserve what they had, and it felt like a risky game. Atlético had them where they wanted them. Could they find a way through? The substitute, Rodrigo De Paul, curled just wide, while another replacement, Matheus Cunha, saw a shot blocked by Stones.",Sport/Football,Felipe sent off late as Manchester City battle past feisty Atlético Madrid,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/atletico-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report
4/14/2022,"Good morning. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will push hard on their campaigns today before the Easter break, with the prime minister in Tasmania to announce a forestry package, and the Labor leader in New South Wales to propose health reforms. Meanwhile delays are expected in domestic airports as Australians take advantage of the long weekend. Scott Morrison has effectively abandoned his promise to establish a federal anti-corruption watchdog, confirming he would only proceed with legislation in the new parliament if Labor agreed to pass the Coalition’s heavily criticised proposal without amendments. Morrison pledged before the 2019 election to legislate a federal integrity body in the parliamentary term that has just endedbut failed to introduce his own proposal before the 46th parliament was prorogued. On the hustings on Wednesday, Morrison was asked – given his previous undertaking to create the body – whether he would promise to put his proposal to a vote in the next parliament in the event the Coalition won the 21 May election. The prime minister said: “Our position on this hasn’t changed. Our view has been the same – when the Labor party is prepared to support that legislation in that form, then we will proceed with it.” Ukrainian authorities have collected the bodies of 765 civilians, including 30 children, in the Kyiv area since Russian forces were routed there at the start of April, a senior prosecutor in the region has said. The Kyiv region’s deputy head prosecutor, Oleh Tkalenko, said officials expected that many more bodies would be found in the coming weeks. “This is only the beginning,” Tkalenko said. “There’s a lot we haven’t dug up yet.” Meanwhile the head of the World Health Organization has criticised the global community’s focus on the war in Ukraine, arguing that crises elsewhere, including in his home country of Ethiopia, are not being given equal consideration, possibly because the people affected are not white. The Morrison government has argued that Labor cannot be trusted to manage the federal budget. Scott Morrison and the finance minister, Simon Birmingham, have both claimed Labor’s pandemic policies would have cost an extra $81bn since 2020. But where did this $81bn figure come from and is it an accurate reflection of the net impact of Labor’s policies? Companies linked to the proponent of the Urannah Dam project in north Queensland have given more than $150,000 to the Liberal National party, including a donation made a week after the Morrison government promised to spend $483m on its construction. NSW Liberal candidate Katherine Deves described a campaign supporting LGBTQ youth as a “grooming tactic” used by “gender extremists”. Queues and delays at Australian airports are expected to be at their worst before the Easter long weekend and security providers have warned the chaos stemming from staff shortages will continue into the second half of the year. Plans to accelerate the closure of Australia’s biggest coal-fired plant have the potential to create electricity shortages in three states unless enhancements to the grid proceed and new generation and storage capacity is added, the market operator said. Record crowds at Melbourne’s grand prix and comedy festival have boosted foot traffic in the CBD, with pedestrian activity in the heart of the city exceeding pre-pandemic levels by 15% over the weekend. Roman Abramovich has had more than £5.4bn (AU$9.5bn) of his assets frozen in Jersey and 12 luxury properties – including a near-£100m (AU$176m) villa on the Riviera that was once the holiday home of King Edward VIII – seized by the French government. A senior US military general has warned during a visit to Australia that China’s offer to deepen security ties with Solomon Islands will come with strings attached, suggesting the Pacific island country may come to regret the planned deal. Devastating floods have killed 259 people in the South African city of Durban and surrounding areas, a senior government official said on Wednesday, after hillsides were washed away and homes collapsed, with more people still feared missing. Indonesia has passed a landmark bill that outlaws forced marriage and sexual harassment. The new law includes 15-year prison sentences for sexual exploitation, nine years for forced marriage and four years for circulating non-consensual sexual content. Myanmar jailed more writers and public intellectuals in crackdowns last year than any other country, according to a freedom of expression advocacy group. Sri Lanka’s doctors have warned they are almost out of life-saving medicines and say the country’s economic crisis threatened a worse death toll than the coronavirus pandemic. Work is the master of the modern world. For most people, it is impossible to imagine society without it. It dominates and pervades everyday life more completely than at any time in recent history. An obsession with employability runs through education. Corporate superstars show off their epic work schedules. Tech companies say round-the-clock work is play. Gig economy companies claim that round-the-clock work is freedom. Workers commute further, strike less, retire later. The point is: work has ruled our lives for centuries, and it does so today more than ever. But a new generation of thinkers insists there is an alternative. For many western Sydney restaurants, the month of Ramadan is the busiest time of year. For fasting staff, that means a day spent around food without stopping to eat. “It’s not particularly hard cooking while fasting, but it is tempting.” With the election under way, the Guardian’s political reporters have been travelling across the country talking to voters and candidates. In Western Australia, the 2021 state election – returning just two Liberals to the WA lower house – sent shock waves through the Liberal party, and put WA on the map as a state that could deliver a rich return for federal Labor.Political reporter Paul Karp speaks to voters in three WA seats about the issues that will decide their vote. He also speaks to candidates in the seat of Hasluck, where a moderate swing to Labor could knock out a current cabinet minister.
