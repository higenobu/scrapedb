4/23/2022,"Marjorie Taylor Greene is testifying under oath on Friday about her alleged role in the events of last Jan. 6. She isn’t too happy about it. The court appearance follows U.S. District Court Judge Amy Totenberg’s ruling earlier this week that a case seeking to disqualify Greene from office for “engaging in insurrection or rebellion” could proceed. Greene has consistently and very publicly pushed conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, while rilling up her supporters to descend on Washington, D.C., ahead of the election’s certification last Jan. 6.

Then Cowered Greene was confronted with several of her social media posts on the issue while on the stand, but she was hesitant to take ownership of the views she’s pushed in the past. The conspiracy theorist from Georgia has long engaged with some of the most extreme corners of conservative media, pushing lies about Democratic colleagues, hate speech, and calls for violence, and on Friday she seemed well aware of how bad her record looks when it’s removed from the cesspool of right-wing demagoguery on the internet and laid bare in a court of law. “Is it fair to say that from Election Night until January 6th, your personal opinion and your wish was that Congress not certify Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election?” she was asked. “No, that’s not accurate,” she replied. Question: Is it fair to say that from election night until January 6th, your personal opinion and your wish was that Congress not certify Joe Biden?

Greene in media appearances earlier this week seemed worried that the media would zero in on specific clips and sound bites from her testimony on Friday. “They’re going to click and cut and paste so they can sell a lie on their networks every night,” she said during an appearance on One America News. It stands to reason that she may been refraining from admitting to her previous comments throughout her testimony on Friday out of fear that networks would “click and cut and paste” them for what they are. Greene ultimately said of Pelosi that by “not securing the border that violates her oath of office,” but declined to admit she called her a traitor. “Fair enough,” the attorney replied. “I’m not interested in her oath of office. I’m interested in that you said she’s a traitor to our country.” Question to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene: ""In fact, you think that Speaker Pelosi is a traitor to the country, right?"" Greene: ""I'm not answering that question…I haven't said that."" Q: ""Put up plaintiff's exhibit 5."" Greene: ""Oh, no. Wait. Hold on now…"" pic.twitter.com/hBHPAkUOaA — CSPAN (@cspan) April 22, 2022 Rolling Stone reported in October that Greene was one of several Republican lawmakers who participating in the organization of the rally near the White House that preceded the Capitol attack. The topic came up on Friday, of course, and instead of denying her involvement, Greene repeatedly said she didn’t recall any conversations she might have had regarding what was to come on Jan. 6. She was first asked if she talked to anyone in the government about whether there would be protests on Jan. 6. “I don’t remember,” she said. “We were mostly reading information about election fraud and people signed affidavits what they’d witnessed with voter fraud, and preparing to object. That’s pretty much all I remember.” “Pretty much, but your testimony as you sit here today under oath is that you didn’t talk to anybody in government about the fact that there were going to be large protests in Washington on Jan. 6?” the attorney asked. “I don’t remember.” She was asked if she talked to Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.) “I don’t remember.” She was asked if she talked to Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) “Sorry, I don’t remember.” What about anyone in the White House? “I don’t remember.” Did she hear anyone mention the potential for violence on Jan. 6? “I don’t remember.” This story is developing… Best of Rolling Stone The Useful Idiots New Guide to the Most Stoned Moments of the 2020 Presidential Campaign Anatomy of a Fake News Scandal The Radical Crusade of Mike Pence Click here to read the full article.

4/23/2022,"OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) — The French military has released videos appearing to show Russian mercenaries burying bodies near an army base in northern Mali, which it says is part of a smear campaign against the French who handed the base to Malian forces earlier this week. Aerial surveillance images taken by the French military on Thursday morning and provided to The Associated Press show what appear to be 10 Caucasian soldiers covering approximately a dozen Malian bodies with sand 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) east of the Gossi military base in the country’s north, according to a French military officer who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press on the matter. In the video one of the soldiers appears to be filming the scene. The Caucasian soldiers in the video are believed to be members of the Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary force, the officer said. Several tweets with pictures of the bodies have been posted on accounts that support Russia or fake accounts created by Wagner, the officer said. The tweets blame the French for the killings and the burials, according to the French officer. One tweet from an account called Dia Diarra, allegedly created by Wagner, said: “This is what the French left behind when they left base at #Gossi. These are excerpts from a video that was taken after they left! We cannot keep silent about this!” The French army transferred control of the Gossi base to Malian soldiers on Tuesday, in what the French said was a safe, orderly and transparent manner. Later that day a “French sensor observed a dozen Caucasian individuals, most likely belonging to the Wagner Group,” and a detachment from the Malian army arrive at the Gossi site and unload equipment, said the French military in a confidential report that was seen by AP. Mali's army spokesman Col. Souleymane Dembele said that a team has been dispatched to Gossi to investigate, adding “it is still early for us to react on this case.” The French military said the move to discredit the French forces operating in northern Mali is part of a coordinated campaign of multiple information attacks on them that has been going on for months. “The Wagner Group and the Malian Armed Forces appear to be taking disregard for human life to new levels in Mali,” said Alex Thurston, assistant professor of political science at the University of Cincinnati in the United States. “Anti-French sentiments, however, reflect more than just Russian disinformation. The Malian junta and Wagner are trying to harness those frustrations, but they did not create them,” he said. French troops have been a major presence in Mali since helping to dislodge jihadi rebels from strongholds in northern Mali in 2013. But the extremists' attacks on civilians and the military have continued as the rebels have pushed south. The ongoing violence has prompted numerous anti-French protests in the capital. In February, France announced it would withdraw its troops from Mali amid tensions with the country’s ruling military junta and the West African country’s decision to employ Russian mercenaries from the Wagner Group. About 1,000 of the Russian mercenaries are believed to be operating in Mali, according to military experts. Earlier this month foreign soldiers thought to be the Russians working with the Malian army were accused of killing an estimated 300 men — some of them suspected Islamic extremist fighters but most civilians — in Moura in central Mali, according to Human Rights Watch. It was the worst single atrocity reported in Mali’s 10-year armed conflict against Islamic extremists, according to the group which said it interviewed several witnesses about the killings. It’s unclear where the bodies seen in the video Friday came from. The French military official said they might have possibly been taken from near Hombori town, approximately 90 kilometers (56 miles) from Gossi, where there had been fighting a few days earlier, but he could not confirm it. The apparently staged graves can be seen as the latest example of Russia’s disinformation campaign to damage France’s reputation and it also reflects badly on Mali’s army, which must have been aware of the Russians’ actions, said Rida Lyammouri, senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, a Moroccan-based organization focused on economics and policy. “This incident at Gossi camp will further put Mali’s junta at odds with the international community, and it wouldn’t be surprising if they come up with an unrealistic explanation,” he said. He said the aerial images provided by the French military have largely stymied the Russian disinformation effort. “This is a big win for France who’s been facing tough times about its reputation in Mali,” he said. ___ AP writer Baba Ahmed in Bamako, Mali contributed.",World/Associated Press,Russians accused of staging French burial of bodies in Mali,https://news.yahoo.com/russians-accused-staging-french-burial-104100675.html
