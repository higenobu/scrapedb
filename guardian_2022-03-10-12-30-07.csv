3/10/2022,"The end of last year saw a nice jump in the number of hours being worked, but the latest labour account figures released on Wednesday by the bureau of statistics reveal that there are now more people working multiple jobs than ever before. Since the dark days of the pandemic in the middle of 2020, it is fair to say the economy has recovered well – and better than most economists expected. Recessions are horrendous things that generally destroy work for many years even once the economy is back growing. The Covid recession, however, was different because it was a largely government-decided recession – people and business had to stop work and had to stop moving across borders to prevent the spread of Covid, and that was why we had a recession. But while the job recovery has been better than expected, when we look at what type of work has grown, we see some big concerns. In the last three months of 2021, the number of hours worked increased a very solid 4.3%. That was to be expected, given in the September quarter last year the number of hours worked fell 4.8% due to lockdown in New South Wales and Victoria. But the number of jobs increased only 3.4% and the number of people employed increased only 3.3%. What this tells us is that there was not just a return to more work being done by people in their existing jobs, but there was also an increase in the number of people working a second job. In fact, while the number of “main” jobs rose 2.8% in the December quarter of 2021, the number of secondary jobs (ie either another job you work that pays less than your main one) rose 11.5%: If the graph does not display please click here This would not be so bad if it were a one-off, but it is a trend that we have been seeing not just during the pandemic, but for the past eight years. There is now a greater percentage of people with more than one job than ever before. In the December quarter 6.4% of employed people had a secondary job – up from 5.2% in the middle of 2014 and 5.7% at the time of the last federal election: If the graph does not display please click here Since the last federal election, the government can say that 400,900 extra jobs have been created, but nearly a third – 122,700 – of them are jobs being worked by someone who already has a job. A strong growth in secondary jobs is not a sign of a healthy economy – no one takes a second job because they have got nothing better to do with their time. You take it because you are not getting enough income from your main job, whether because the hourly rate is poor or there are not enough hours available to work. But it has been a feature of job growth since the Coalition government came to power in 2013. If the graph does not display please click here Usually secondary and main jobs grow at around the same rate. But during the Abbott/Turnbull/Morrison years, secondary job growth has far exceeded that of main jobs – up 30% compared to a 14% rise in main jobs since September 2013. And the reason? Working one job is not enough to pay the bills. The real compensation per job is now lower than it was in 2012. Take away the boost from the pandemic stimulus, which has now dissipated, and real compensation per job has not gone up for nearly a decade: If the graph does not display please click here The reason is the growth of part-time jobs – jobs that in the past would have been full-time but are now offering under 30 hours a week – and the decline in wages growth. As a result, people are needing to work more hours in another job. Unfortunately, right now we are not seeing much improvement even when we look at compensation per hours worked. In the last three months of last year, real compensation for each hour worked fell sharply for most workers, and on average fell 0.5% for all workers through all of 2021: If the graph does not display please click here Since the last federal election productivity has risen 4.4% but real hourly compensation has increased just 1.6%. This suggests that wages are not growing as fast as they should be. Both the secretary of the Treasury and the governor of the Reserve Bank have told parliamentary committees that real wages should grow at the rate of productivity and doing so places no pressure on inflation. But since the last election only six industries have had real hourly compensation grow faster than productivity, and in some industries such as manufacturing, real compensation has actually fallen while productivity has grown: If the graph does not display please click here It is clear workers are not being properly rewarded for their efforts and inevitably this has led to more people than ever before finding they need to work more jobs and more hours just to make ends meet.",News/Business,"Rise in hours worked signals post-lockdown recovery, but more people have multiple jobs than ever | Greg Jericho",https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2022/mar/10/rise-in-hours-worked-signals-post-lockdown-recovery-but-more-people-have-multiple-jobs-than-ever
