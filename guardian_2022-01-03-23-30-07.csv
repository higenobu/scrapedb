1/3/2022,"Police have named a five-year-old boy who died in Oldham, Greater Manchester, on New Year’s Eve as Dylan Scanlon. A woman in her 30s has been detained under the Mental Health Act and police are investigating the death. Dylan’s father, Gary Keenan, described him as his best friend, in a tribute on Facebook. He wrote: “To my Dylan I love you more than everything in this world you was my best friend and I’m really going to miss you son sweet dreams and we will meet again 1 day love you son.”  Greater Manchester police (GMP) said officers were called by the ambulance service at about 6.20pm on Friday 31 December. Dylan was pronounced dead at the scene. The force has referred itself to the police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, and its professional standards branch because of “previous police contact”. DCI Alicia Smith, of GMP’s major incident team, said: “Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time and they are being supported by specialist officers. An investigation by a dedicated team into Dylan’s death is ongoing and the family is being kept fully informed.” Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 0161 856 3656 or anonymously via Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.",News/UK news,Police name five-year-old Oldham boy who died on New Year’s Eve,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/police-name-five-year-old-oldham-boy-who-died-on-new-years-eve
1/3/2022,"It’s gotten rather tricky to calibrate the the annual relative quotient of tragedy. (For the future reference of misery-focused sociologists, that’s the ARQT.) 2021 was a year of tribulation closing out with a backslide into the same rampant viral spread that we saw in square one of the pandemic that just won’t end – but hey, at least it’s not 2020 anymore. As it becomes apparent that we will have to accept a few massive catastrophes as the new status quo, assessing the quality of life turns into a matter of degrees, weighing each fresh stretch of hardship against the last. It may prove some cold comfort to note that things have, by sheer numbers, gotten slightly better since last year. The corollary to this way of thinking, however, is the understanding that our circumstances can always get worse.  Just take a look at the films set in the year 2022, united as they are in agreement that something horrible is just waiting to happen. There’s a futuristic sheen to the number, as if a robot’s stuttering while giving a readout of two, that’s compelled a handful of film-makers to select this date as the point at which a major crisis comes to pass. Whether it’s a chance armageddon landing at an inopportune time or a boiling-over that our species has been building to for years, the movies have marked 2022 as cursed. The only hope as we approach the beginning of another year is that whatever challenges await us, they won’t have the terrible finality of the world-enders listed below. Read on for a smorgasbord of possible apocalypses imagined for the coming months, and take some solace in the small consolation that we have yet to start eating each other: Way before Carey and Chad Hayes made their name by writing 2013’s The Conjuring, the twin brothers scripted this direct-to-video cult classic about a crew of astronauts venturing into a galactic no man’s land. They’ve entered the void of low orbit to repair a nuclear-arming satellite, but a power failure sends them floating helplessly toward a long-defunct Nasa shuttle they board in search of aid. The game of cat-and-mouse that follows is too weird in its particulars to be dismissed as the Alien rip-off it appears to be; the reanimated corpse and the leather dominatrix robot prime us for the grand reveal that the stalker picking off the explorers is actually Satan himself. (Turns out this station is hovering above the Bermuda Triangle.) As unfortunate turns of events go, this one isn’t so bad, by its very nature contained and remote. If the devil does turn out to be one of next year’s primary antagonists, we should be so lucky to keep him stuck in outer space. Soylent Green, as you may already be aware through sheer cultural osmosis, is people. In Richard Fleischer’s infamous sci-fi thriller, NYPD detective Frank Thorn gets the ultimate validation for his paranoia about the miracle foodstuff mass-produced by a shadowy corporation, for which the magic ingredient just so happens to be the finely ground corpses of the underclass. Screenwriter Stanley Greenberg (and Harry Harrison, author of the novel Make Room! Make Room! that inspired the film) was right on the money in his vision of an economy stratified by scarcity, as overpopulation, pollution, and an eerily prescient climate cataclysm exacerbate hunger and poverty. That said, we haven’t yet resorted to devouring each other — that seems to be the one taboo that’s going to hold up through any and all mounting desperation — but we’re not so far off from Snowpiercer’s future of nutrient-rich sustenance bars made from mashed cockroach. Once we’ve cleaned out the global cupboards of actual food, we’ll have no choice but to turn on that which is merely edible. This past summer’s straight-to-streaming Chris Pratt vehicle didn’t make quite the splash a producer might hope for from a $200m budget, but it’s built around an idea with deep resonance to the present day: that it falls to those living now to anticipate and negate the conflicts that will face the next generation. In 2022, emissaries from the year 2051 materialize with a warning of an impending alien invasion twenty-six years down the road, and beg for the help of the present-day armed forces to time-travel ahead so they can help beat back the extraterrestrial menace. Pratt’s Green Beret turned supersoldier gets the drop on the beasts dubbed “Whitespikes,” only to discover that to completely purge the Earth of these hostiles, he’ll have to return to his own time and act then. (It’s worth noting that the aliens were actually submerged in a glacier and released by the thaw of global warming.) Goes to show that the old saying is right — an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of full-bore military offensives. When the lucrative spec-fic horror franchise first launched with this flagship film, 2022 was far away enough to allow for acclimation to an unthinkable way of life. The survival nightmare takes place after eight successful observances of the Purge, the annual holiday during which all crime is legal, allowing America to release its pent-up rage and chill out for 364 days of the year. Though this series still has yet to realize the full disturbing potential of its ingenious premise, its name has been invoked to describe real-life goings-on with greater frequency as of late. During the run-up to the 2020 election, Donald Trump’s favorite scaremongering tactic was to paint a picture of Joe Biden’s America as a lawless hellscape where marauding gangs sowed mayhem with impunity. In actuality, the tenor of unrest is almost the exact opposite of that articulated in the film; rather than the barely repressed bigotry fueling the Purge onscreen, the demonstrations of destruction during protests were motivated by demands for justice, far from the bedlam for its own sake imagined by this film. Martin Campbell’s juiced-up B-movie taps a peak-form Ray Liotta for ex-marine John Robbins, a man imprisoned for the murder of his commanding officer back in Benghazi. He’s sent to the island penal colony of Absolom, where the worst of the worst have been left to their own murderous devices and divided themselves into the warlike, savage Outsiders and the civilized, humane Insiders. The miniature revolution led by Robbins didn’t have all that much insight to shed on the carceral-state debate at the time of its release, but today, it looks like a comically outsized take on a real issue. Its guiding principle that inmates are robbed of their dignity by a system that treats them like easily exploited chattel holds true, if anything rendered more impactful by the advances in public understanding of this sorry situation. We can only hope that we’ll have as noble a leader as character actor Lance Henriksen to expose the treatment festering in the prison-industrial complex. Well, the good news is that we haven’t implemented the use of widespread weather-control satellites just yet, so annihilation-level inclement conditions on a global scale may not be in the cards. That’s the armageddon facing the human race in Dean Devlin’s admirably dumb eco-spectacle, in which space cowboy Gerard Butler represents our last line of defense against certain death by Mother Nature. The opening salvos before the much-feared main event giving this film its title are bad enough, ranging from skyscraper-drowning typhoons to torrential downpours of lightning singeing city blocks to a crisp. It’s all a bit store-brand Roland Emmerich in the awed-eyed photography, but natural events of biblical ruin are growing regrettably commonplace. Even if Butler cuts a larger-than-life figure, the threat he faces still speaks to a legitimate fear many of us contend with every time we open a newspaper. His character and his power to stop doomsday is a reassuring fiction, the one man who can change an obliteration the rest of us are helpless to halt.",Arts/Film,Unhappy new year: what can we learn from movies set in 2022?,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/03/movies-films-future-2022-new-year
1/3/2022,"Romaine Hart gave me my start in the film business, hiring me as usher at the Screen on the Green cinema in Islington, London, when I was 18; alongside the programmer Roger Austin she taught me fundamental lessons about cinema management that inspired me through the Other Cinema, Scala and later Palace years. As a teenager I had witnessed the transformation of my local, the Rex cinema on Upper Street, a downmarket fleapit that was part of a declining chain owned by the Bloom family (Romaine’s maiden name), to the Screen on the Green, with its progressive and clever programming. It showed critically acclaimed, mainly US second-run classics by day (the first double bill I attended as a 15-year-old was The Graduate and The Thomas Crown Affair). From 11.15pm the late-night cinema club showed cult films such as Performance, audacious double bills featuring Chabrol, Kurosawa and other greats of world cinema and obscure but daring fare like Henry Miller’s Quiet Days in Clichy. The Friday all-nighters of the Marx Brothers and Humphrey Bogart classics were usually packed to the rafters.  To keep this challenging programme viable in newly gentrified Islington, Romaine kept overhead costs to a minimum (I can still feel the weight of those heavy metal 35mm film cases, running them up and down the narrow stairs to the tiny projection box). Sales of Kia-Ora squash drinks and boxes of Maltesers were pushed to the maximum, with all of the ushers doing ice-cream breaks with a tray between films. Even at 1am in the morning. It was tough in the 70s: cinema audiences were at a low ebb and the Screen was barred from showing first-run films, which instead went to the Odeon Angel, ABC cinema on Holloway Road and Essoldo Caledonian Road. Romaine was a shrewd, incisive and – beneath the occasionally gruff but glamorous business exterior – generous person who gave me a fundamental grounding not just in exhibition but also distribution with her company Mainline Pictures. With Roger she distributed movies by Alan Rudolph, Monte Hellman, Billy Wilder and John Waters at a time when distribution costs were at a premium; later on I released Eraserhead with her at the Scala. Programming an all-nighter of films interspersed with live performances from the then unknown Sex Pistols, the Clash and Buzzcocks was just one more brilliant coup that inspired a new generation of punk fans into the cinema. It was an unforgettable event to have been an usher at and another example of thinking outside the box against the oppressive shackles that the film industry had imposed on exhibition at that time. Romaine’s attributes are too numerous to list but, as a woman in the quite frankly sluggish and male-dominated 70s British film industry, her acumen, good taste, quick wit and infectious sense of humour stood out as a beacon of hope for so many who followed. Later I took her values with me into production – her principles of acquiring high quality or challenging films combined with reasonable budgets remain with me as a producer. I personally owe a lot to Romaine and Roger, and to try to put that into words is difficult, but she transformed cinema-going in that little part of London where I grew up and brought excitement back in a pre-home video, pre-multichannel TV time period, when most people were pronouncing the film industry as dead in the water.

1/3/2022,"The head of the National Trust has said she received anonymous death threats during a “culture war” row over the organisation’s perceived “wokeness”. Hilary McGrady, the NT’s director general, said she did not report the intimidation to the police as “it comes with the territory”.  The row was sparked by NT efforts to learn more about the history of its properties, including a report published last year that found connections between 93 of its historic places and colonialism and slavery. Criticism of what some saw as a politicised assault on heritage spilled on to social media and the press. McGrady said the academic author of the report “had a much harder time” than she had. More recently, a group calling itself Restore Trust sought to win seats on the NT’s governing council at its annual general meeting in October. The group claimed to represent grassroots opposition to what it characterised as the NT’s “woke” agenda, and said it wanted to steer the trust “back to its core purpose of looking after our heritage and countryside”. Three of Restore Trust’s candidates were elected to the 36-seat council, although one has denied he endorses the group’s concerns. McGrady said she suspected Restore Trust would continue its campaign despite its failure to realise its goal of six council members. “I would like to engage with them honestly and openly. What isn’t helpful is a war of words. I’m really up for having those conversations … I have to accept I can’t lead an organisation of this scale and not take on these challenges. It comes with the territory and I’m pretty sanguine about that,” she said. Some members and visitors had been “really cross and angry with us” over the issues raised by Restore Trust, she said. “There were also people really delighted and relieved that we’re finally looking at the history that they want to learn.” McGrady said the past two years had been difficult for the NT but there was “a sense of being able to draw a line” despite worries around the Omicron variant of Covid. There had been a “huge jump” in membership in the past few months, she said. The NT had been on the verge of reaching 6 million members when the pandemic struck. “We did lose a lot of people for all sorts of reasons – financial worries or just knowing that they wouldn’t be able to use their membership – but I think we’ll be back to 6 million this coming year,” she said. The trust has ambitious plans for 2022, including picnics, fetes, beacon lighting and tree planting to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee, and an exhibition on Beatrix Potter in conjunction with the V&A in London. It has also set a goal of being net zero by 2030. “As a very significant landowner, we have a huge part to play in dealing with climate harm,” McGrady said. The trust aims to convert 10% of its 250,000 hectares of land to “nature rich”, and is planting 20m trees this decade. The NT plans to build on work after the report published last year detailing connections between 93 of its properties and colonialism and historical slavery. “Every day we uncover another bit of history. We have an obligation to tell this huge, complex, layered story of the history of the three countries we’re responsible for. The idea that history stands still is nonsense because you keep finding new things.” McGrady said the 2020 report was “first-stage research. The next step is, property by property, to [ask if] we need to do more research. And how would we weave that into the story so that we get a whole history of the place? It will take a long time, to be honest.” She insisted: “No one is forcing this down your throat. No one is trying to make you read this stuff. There’s no sense that we’re trying to preach and, certainly, definitely not judge. We’re trying to provide layers of information; we’re taking nothing away. We’re adding to the complexity of the information available. But if [people] want to come along and walk around the garden and have a lovely cup of tea, I am delighted about that. Why would I be prescriptive as to how people should engage with the National Trust?” When McGrady was appointed to lead the NT in 2018, she wanted to make it a “truly accessible” organisation, she said. “It certainly wasn’t an organisation that feels necessarily for everybody, and it still doesn’t. My mission was to take down any barrier that might get in the way of anyone feeling the trust is here for them.” That included practical measures such as wheelchair access and audio loops, and ensuring that the NT’s staff reflect “the UK as it is”. She said the demographics of its membership were changing from the perception of white, middle-class and middle-aged, but “it’s not as diverse as I want it to be. And I’m as interested in the socio-economic split as I am BAME and people with disabilities.” The organisation’s strategy was to reflect the communities it serves, but the community in the south-west was very different to the community in Birmingham, she said. “I’m very conscious that across the country there are different communities who want different things from the trust. That’s what I’m really focused on. How do we make ourselves accessible to the people who want to engage with us? But what a long way to go, and I’m the first to acknowledge that.”",News/UK news,National Trust boss says she received death threats amid ‘woke’ row,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/national-trust-boss-says-she-received-death-threats-woke-row
1/3/2022,"Countries that succumb to authoritarianism rarely do so with a sudden dramatic flash, where one day freedom is there and then suddenly it isn’t. It is normally a process of attrition, of rights and liberties eroded by stealth. The political atmosphere becomes gradually more intolerant: hysteria is whipped up against dissidents, whose supposed transgressions are carefully selected to justify a new crackdown. The battle lines are defined between a law-abiding majority and an extreme fringe. This is what has happened in Hungary, governed by a party that once belonged to the Liberal International and now has set up a virtual dictatorship. It is the danger facing our own country, too. I spoke to 21-year-old student Louis McKechnie as he made a journey from the prison gates familiar to countless rebels before him. An activist involved with climate protest group Insulate Britain, he was imprisoned for six weeks after breaching an injunction against road blockades. “I got to the point where I was more terrified of the government’s inaction on the climate crisis than I was about any repercussions the courts would give me,” he said. He was “terrified” of prison, but far from deterring him, his incarceration has made him more resolute. Along with eight fellow activists, their imprisonment was a warning to anyone seeking to take up Britain’s long tradition of peaceful civil disobedience.  Insulate Britain is not popular, but then neither was Pussy Riot in Russia when they stormed a church in Moscow. Now all reasonable people would accept that Putin’s Russia is an authoritarian state – much more so than our own – and we would look to the imprisonment of those protesters as a case in point. But it is easier to recognise repression for what it is in other countries. The punitive measures deployed against Insulate Britain are an example of a country descending into an authoritarian mire. Imagine if another country introduced a law allowing the police to shut down protests for being too noisy or causing “serious annoyance”, allowing stop and search without any suspicion, banning specific individuals from joining protests and granting sweeping powers to the state to decide which protests are allowed. This is what the Conservatives’ police, crime, sentencing and courts bill in its current form allows for. Using the backlash against Insulate Britain, the government has toughened up the law. It exposes the laughable claims of some commentators that Boris Johnson’s guiding philosophy “is that he will not restrict our liberties unless there is an overwhelming reason to do so”, as one senior journalist put it. “It won’t stop people protesting,” as human rights organisation Liberty’s Emmanuelle Andrews put it, “but many more people who go out to protest will be at risk of arrest. It shrinks our ability to make our voices heard in quite an unprecedented way.” Banning orders can bar anyone convicted of more than one protest-related offence from exercising their democratic right. Protesters who attach themselves to others, the ground or an object (or who are deemed to intend to do so) face imprisonment. If a protest is thought to cause a huge public nuisance then stop and search can be used with impunity. Note the Tory MPs who have defined temporary restrictions to prevent the spread of a deadly virus as transforming Britain into a police state. Like Marcus Fysh, who declared: “We are not a ‘papers please’ society. This is not Nazi Germany. It’s the thin end of an authoritarian wedge.” Or Tim Loughton, who said he did not want to live in “a society in which we ask for papers and deprive people of their liberty”. Yet they backed and voted for measures that strip away hard-won rights and freedoms, dramatically enlarging the ability of the state to deprive its own citizens of their liberty. The danger, as Liberty’s Andrews noted, is that it “changes the face of what democratic participation looks like: that only a protest ‘elite’ who are willing to get arrested” take to the streets. Insulate Britain’s Louis McKechnie may feel emboldened: but many more may be deterred. Indeed, it is inevitable that those most affected will be Britain’s marginalised communities. We know that Black Londoners are up to eight times more likely to be victims of stop and search; and that the Metropolitan police were twice as likely to fine Black people under Covid rules compared with white people. It’s not all over – the House of Lords will debate the legislation in January – but the course Britain is on is clear. From the policing bill to the nationality and borders bill – which further brutalises refugees and migrants and grants power to strip millions of dual nationality Britons of their citizenship – we are coming to resemble a police state cosplaying as a democracy. How gruesome to watch rights and freedoms our ancestors fought for at huge cost stripped away with barely a murmur. Whether we decide to replicate their courage to resist is up to us.

1/3/2022,"Feminist campaigners in France are calling for tougher government action to combat violence against women and girls after three women were allegedly killed by their current or former partner on the first day of 2022. The body of a 28-year-old military recruit who had been stabbed to death was found near Saumur in western France on Saturday. The local prosecutor, Alexandra Verron, said a 21-year-old man, also a soldier, had been arrested and investigators were looking into a possible femicide – the killing of a woman by her partner or ex-partner.  In eastern France, police discovered the body of a 56-year-old woman with a knife in her chest after neighbours at Meurthe-et-Moselle reported a violent dispute. The victim’s husband was questioned by police and was due to appear before a judge on Monday. On Sunday, a 45-year-old woman was found in the boot of a car at a property in Nice. She had been strangled. Police were interviewing the woman’s former partner, a 60-year-old man who reportedly admitted having a violent altercation with his ex-wife, and their 24-year-old son, in whose vehicle the body was allegedly discovered. The mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, said he was devastated by the alleged killing and described it as a “horror”. The collective #NousToutes accused the French government of remaining “scandalously” silent on the grim start to the year for women. It said an estimated 220,000 women reported conjugal violence every year, but judges had ordered the use of electronic bracelets in only 379 cases. Lena Ben Ahmed, of #NousToutes, told France Info radio: “These femicides are not isolated cases. They’re not the occasional news story. They are systematic violence. The whole system colludes in these murders because it banalises and minimises sexist and sexual violence. That’s why we are scandalised by the government’s silence.” In France, there were at least 113 femicides last year, an increase on the 102 officially recorded in 2020. In 2019, a record 146 women were killed. Féminicides Par Compagnons ou Ex, the Femicide by Partner or Ex association, which announced the figures for last year, said it was only an approximate figure and almost certainly an underestimate. “Numerous events that are being looked into and are subject to the omerta of the prosecutors’ offices haven’t been counted,” it said. “No, these’s aren’t ‘family dramas’ or ‘separation dramas’ or ‘crimes of passion’; they are conjugal killings carried out by frustrated men who think they have the right to kill … who because of the patriarchal education given to men think they possess their women and children and can do with their lives as they wish,” the association added. Last August, the interior minister, Gérald Darmanin, announced new measures to combat violence against women and girls, including prioritising complaints of conjugal violence and ensuring each police station and gendarmerie had at least one officer specialised in treating female victims. “The number of police and gendarmerie interventions for intra-family violences remains very high, with more than 400,000 (in 2020), which is 45 every hour,” Darmanin said. “Not a day goes by without [specialist police] freeing a woman or children who are being held hostage,” the minister added. In the UK, the Femicide Census estimates one woman is killed by a man every three days, 62% of them by a current or former partner. A history of abuse was recorded in 59% of killings of women carried out by partners or ex-partners or a male relative. Françoise Brié, the director of the Fédération Nationale Solidarité Femmes (National Federation of Women’s Solidarity), said tougher legislation was needed, including allowing women to conceal the address where they were living if they leave the family home and a violent partner with their children. Ben Ahmed, of #NousToutes, added: “We need training, education, prevention from a young age in schools, lycées, colleges … obviously we are calling on all the presidential election candidates to make concrete promises that include extra personnel, money and materials to address the question of sexist and sexual violence.”",News/World news,New Year’s Day killings spark call for action to tackle violence against women in France,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/new-years-day-killings-spark-call-for-action-to-tackle-violence-against-women-in-france
1/3/2022,"The British Council has launched an inquiry into allegations from black current and former staff members in Kenya who claim they were subjected to systemic racism. Senior white executives at the organisation, which is the British government’s cultural arm abroad, have been accused of discriminating against BAME Kenyan-born staff, particularly as they were selected and assessed for redundancy.  A letter that claims to represent seven current and former staff members sparked the inquiry in July when it was sent to the British Council as well as the Kenyan authorities. It says: “The cases underline a repeated practice by white members of staff to constantly assign Kenyans as underperformers, inadequate, unskilled, unprofessional, and suspects as the organisation abuses its procedures and systems to validate its discriminative practice.” Five of the seven accusers claim they were discriminated against during a redundancy process that they say favoured white colleagues. The allegations come amid cuts in central government funding for the British Council as well as a shortfall of income related to the Covid-19 pandemic. The British Council, known as the UK government’s main instrument of soft power, launched an inquiry into the claims in September and says it takes racism claims seriously. It claims it is still waiting for all of the complainants to come forward with evidence and has queried some of the claims in the initial letter. One of the complainants who was made redundant said he would not cooperate with the inquiry because it was too narrow in scope to include earlier allegations. Apollo Edewa, 33, a former programme manager at the office in Nairobi for five years until February, said staff believed the organisation gave much greater weight to white people’s opinions compared with black people and now wants to tailor the inquiry to justify its prejudices. He said: “The British Council says it will only investigate these allegations if we allow them to manage the complaints process and select the cases to be investigated. But many former and current employees believe that there is a racist culture in the organisation which goes back many years. White people’s opinions are given more weight than black people from Kenya.” Many of the claims revolve around a recent redundancy programme implemented after a shortfall in income after government cuts to the aid budget. Allegations outlined in the letter include: A programme manager who worked at the British Council from August 2014 to 2019 who claimed they were put at risk of redundancy without adequate explanation. Another complainant claimed they resigned as a senior official of the Kenyan office’s welfare association after a white executive frustrated efforts to channel staff concerns to the senior leadership team. “Staff have no confidence raising concerns through HR … for fear of being victimised,” the complainant said. A manager for the professional skills centre in Kenya who claimed they were among a number of black employees who were unfairly targeted for redundancy. The British Council was founded in 1934 to improve cultural relations and improve social mobility, It generates 85% of its own income, mainly through teaching and examinations, and receives some funding through a government bloc grant. It is facing substantial job cuts and office closures after income from English-language teaching and exams plummeted during the pandemic. Regarding the complaints of racism in Kenya, a British Council spokesperson said that they received the letter in July and launched an inquiry in August but were still waiting for all of the complainants to identify themselves. They also pointed out that 98% of employees were locally appointed. According to the British Council, an individual who recognised details of their case in the letter now says he did not give his consent to be included in the complaint. The spokesperson said: “The British Council takes all allegations of discrimination, racism, bullying and harassment very seriously. We operate in over 100 countries across the world and our values of equality, diversity and inclusion are at the heart of everything we do. “On receiving the anonymous letter, we immediately initiated an investigation. This investigation is ongoing, and we are keeping avenues of engagement open with the author of the letter. The author of the letter has not been willing to be interviewed and has not yet provided evidence in support of the allegations.”",News/Politics,British Council launches inquiry after Kenyan staff allege racism,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/03/british-council-launches-inquiry-after-kenyan-staff-allege-racism
1/3/2022,"For many New Yorkers, the inauguration of Eric Adams as the 110th mayor of New York City – and only the second Black person to serve in the position – has evoked a range of feelings, from excitement at the possibility of change to confusion and concern.  Adams’ rise through city and state politics was fairly typical. In addition to serving as a New York police captain, he was the Brooklyn borough president and a state senator. But he remains an unconventional, even enigmatic figure. There are questions surrounding his home address and curiosity about his plant-based diet, but information about his actual policies remain scarce. “Where Eric Adams has thrived, in many ways, is in really failing to lay out a vision,” said Sochie Nnaemeka, director of the New York Working Families party. “His transition has been defined by personality, less [by] an agenda for the city.” Progressives and advocates working across multiple sectors have voiced concerns at the slow emergence of Adams’ plans and priorities, and worry about positions he has taken including increasing the use of the heavily criticized “stop-and-frisk” policy and resurrecting plainclothes policemen units. Adams’ ascent comes at a crucial time in New York history, as the city seeks to emerge from the pandemic and the economic and social chaos that has come with it. New York’s ballooning homelessness crisis, primarily caused by a lack of affordable housing, is one of the largest issues Adam must contend with. In 2020, more than 120,000 people, including children, slept in the New York municipal shelter system, with homelessness reaching the highest levels since the Great Depression. Covid presented additional challenges, spreading rapidly among homeless populations. Advocates have widely supported Adams’ priority of increasing permanent, affordable housing in a city which has some of America’s most expensive rents. But many have raised concerns about Adams’ main plan: converting 25,000 hotel rooms into permanent apartments, noting zoning and conversion requirements many hotels do not meet. Public housing, managed by the New York Public Housing Association, is another area where Adams has faced pushback. Adams supports privatizing public housing units as well as selling air rights above public housing units. Activists have said such actions, presented as an opportunity to raise capital for blighted buildings, are ineffective and that oversight for private landlords when it comes to addressing housing issues like mold and lead paint would become even more difficult. “His focus is going to be on his big-money donors. That’s been his track record all along. That’s not a secret,” said Fight for NYCHA core member Louis Flores. “We expect him to continue down that road, and for public housing that he’s going to support policies that benefit the real estate development industry at the expense of the public housing residents.” Despite ambiguities around some of Adams’ plans for addressing homelessness, some experts are hopeful delays in appointments – and Adams’ reputation for flexibility – could be an opportunity for his administration to receive input from community leaders on how to address the crisis, including through the creation of a deputy to oversee homelessness and affordable housing. ”Having a bit more of a deliberative process is ultimately going to be more impactful than coming out on day one with an ambitious target for the number of units of affordable housing that should be created that might not actually have the impact of reducing homelessness and housing insecurity,” said Jacquelyn Simone, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless. Proposed changes to policing are another point of tension. Adams, who has described assault at the hands of an NYPD officer as inspiration for joining public service, has faced criticism for his plans to resurrect controversial plainclothes units, an anti-crime department in the NYPD involved in a number of shootings, and increase use of stop-and-frisk, a policy critics have condemned as racially discriminatory. While Adams and his newly appointed NYPD commissioner, Keechant Sewell, the first Black woman to lead the department, have supported these policies and vowed to use properly trained, “emotionally intelligent” officers, progressive have argued that previous training attempts have failed, with many officers continually excused for misconduct. “What does the emotional intelligence of an officer matter if he’s got you up against the wall, patting you down,” said Kesi Foster, a lead organizer with the nonprofit Make the Road New York and a steering committee member with Communities United for Police Reform. Simone said: “The ways to solve unsheltered homelessness is not through policing and pushing people from one coroner to another.” Other policing initiatives Adams has sponsored have met criticism, specifically when it comes to New York’s troubled jail system. While Adams has publicly supported closing down Rikers Island, a jail with notoriously poor conditions where several people have died in pre-trial custody, he has also promised to bring back solitary confinement to Rikers, reversing a previous ban on a practice several experts have called “inhumane”. Adams has publicly opposed bail reform measures, meant to curtail pre-trial detention but rolled back, citing debunked claims that releases have spurred increases in crime. “Changing the bail bill is not going to achieve the outcome the mayor wants. We’re hoping that we can convince him of that during his tenure,” said Marie Ndiaye, supervising attorney of the Decarceration Project at the Legal Aid Society. “Getting wishy-washy on bail reform is pretty scary because there’s a pretty linear correlation between the rollbacks and the jail population increasing,” said Sara Rahimi of the nonprofit Emergency Release Fund. In general, advocates contend there is more to be learned about Adams as more appointments are made, but given his comments so far, many are approaching the mayor-elect with caution and timid hope of being able to advance progressive policy. “Cautiously optimistic and cautiously pessimistic all at once would be the way to go there,” said Ndiaye.",News/US news,Progressives concerned as Eric Adams takes helm as New York mayor,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/eric-adams-new-york-mayor-progressive-politics
1/3/2022,"The NHS will face significant pressure in the coming weeks from the nationwide spread of the Omicron variant, Boris Johnson has said, while rejecting the idea that England’s relatively limited Covid restrictions amounted to a gamble. Speaking to reporters on a visit to Buckinghamshire, the prime minister also had strong words for Conservative MPs and others seeking a swift relaxation of the rules, saying it would be “absolute folly” to believe the threat had passed.  There was, Johnson said, “no question Omicron continues to surge through the country”. He added: “I think we’ve got to recognise that the pressure on our NHS, on our hospitals, is going to be considerable in the course the next couple of weeks, and maybe more.” Asked if the decision to have fewer restrictions in England compared with other UK nations or many other places in Europe constituted a gamble, Johnson rejected this. “The way forward for the country as a whole is to continue with the path that we’re on,” he said. “We’ll keep everything under review. But the mixture of things that we’re doing at the moment is, I think, the right one.” While saying that Omicron “does seem pretty conclusively to be less severe” than the previous Delta and Alpha variants, Johnson warned against people believing that the pandemic was approaching an end. “Looking at the pressures on the NHS in the next couple of weeks, and maybe longer, looking at the numbers of people that are going to be going into hospital, it would be absolute folly to say that this thing is all over now bar the shouting,” the prime minister said. “We’ve got to remain cautious, we’ve got to stick to plan B.” Johnson said he had spoken to the NHS England chief executive, Amanda Pritchard, and its medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, adding: “I appreciate the pressures that our hospitals are under. I think it’s vital that we make sure that we help them by trying to contain the pandemic in the ways that I’ve set out.” His comments at a vaccination centre in Aylesbury came as the chief executive of NHS Providers, the membership organisation for health trusts in England, warned that pressures on hospitals outside London was growing fast. Chris Hopson said the pressures of more Covid patients and of staff absences from Omicron came in combination with an “already very, very busy” winter period. He told Sky News: “It’s those two things on top of how busy the system already was.” With parliament returning from the Christmas recess on Wednesday, Johnson is due to gather his cabinet to decide the next steps before then, with the timing not yet confirmed. However, ministers are expected to keep restrictions as they are, and to keep in place the plan B rules on areas such as mask use, Covid passports and home working, following a formal review, also due on Wednesday. Asked about guidance for secondary school students to wear masks once schools return, which has angered some Tory MPs, Johnson said there was “an increasing body of scientific support for the idea that face masks can contain transmission”. He added: “We don’t want to keep them. I don’t like the idea of having face masks in classrooms any more than anybody else does, but we won’t keep them on a day more than is necessary.”",News/World news,"NHS faces significant pressure in coming weeks, says Boris Johnson",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/03/nhs-faces-significant-pressure-in-coming-weeks-says-boris-johnson
