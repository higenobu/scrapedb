12/21/2021,"Several organizations, including the Maryland chapter of the NAACP, are calling for male staff members at Howard County High School in the Baltimore suburb of Ellicott City to be criminally charged after disturbing video footage showing school officials restraining and striking the student in the head. In a statement to WUSA9 earlier this month, Howard County Public Schools said that the student, whose name has not been released, reportedly assaulted multiple other students on Thursday, Dec. 2, in the cafeteria and that the Howard County Public School security guard and a school administrator intervened and helped the school student resource officer subdue the student — the three staff members featured in the disturbing clip. The student, who is Black, was later disciplined. The security assistant, a former police officer, was placed on paid leave. However, the NAACP says the school employees should be charged. “It has been brought to our attention that criminal charges have been filed against the child who was attacked by an adult HCPSS employee, but no charges have been filed against the adult,” president of the NAACP Maryland State Conference Willie Flowers said in a statement to the news station. “We have demanded an investigation into the incident, but we never thought that a student would be charged for a crime when the student was the one on the ground being assaulted by three male adults and punched in the head by one of them. It sends a terrible message to the community that children will be abused, and the traumatizing acts of an adult employee will be overlooked,” Flowers added. “The security assistant assaulted the student with the amount of force that is intended to cause serious bodily harm while the SRO and assistant principals stood by and watched,” NAACP representative Candace Jaimes said. “Therefore, it is the position of the NAACP that the staff that was involved in that incident should be fired and charged criminally.” Howard County Black Community Aging Council and African American Community Roundtable have also called for the employees to be terminated. Barbara Peart of the Council on Aging said incidents like these are not foreign and says there’s no room to question the student’s behavior in a statement to US Time Today. “We demand that appropriate measures be taken against others who have perpetrated violence against this child and the school system, instead of hiding behind the policies, look at the policies and realize what isn’t working, what needs to be done, and what needs to be changed,” Peart added. In addition, the organization is also asking that Superintendent Dr. Michael Martirano review their training procedure and the hiring practices for staff so that “they are safe to be in contact with students.” More news from our partners: Despite Video Evidence, Ex La Mesa Cop Charged with Lying In a Police Report About the Arrest of a Black Man That Went Viral Acquitted by Jury “Death Appears To Be Part Of A Disturbing Trend” | Ex-NFL Player Glenn Foster Choked Before Dying In An Alabama Sheriff’s Department Custody Pandemic Pivot: Entrepreneur Turns His Nightclub Into Houston’s First Black-Owned Grocer Featuring Black Brands",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,NAACP and Community Leaders Are Asking for Three High School Employees to be Terminated After Video Footage Shows Them Restraining a Student and Hitting Him,https://news.yahoo.com/naacp-community-leaders-asking-three-133000705.html

 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Monday called on Democrats to ""crack down on the Senate,"" which she likened to ""an old boys club."" The progressive lawmaker in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" slammed the chamber's inability to pass voting rights legislation because of GOP-led filibusters. Ocasio-Cortez has previously called on the Senate to abolish the filibuster, a move that moderate Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) have opposed. ""What we really need to do is crack down on the Senate, which operates like an old boys club that has a couple of gals in it that have managed to break through, and we need to actually institute some, we actually need implementing institutional discipline,"" Ocasio-Cortez said on Monday. ""If people want to threaten to block ambassadorships, if they want to threaten dysfunction, they actually need to show up and do it, need to show up and do a talking filibuster, when - and by the way, that is a compromise because there shouldn't even be a filibuster in the first place. And they need to really make sure that we are actually calling people to her threats,"" she added. The House has already passed the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, both of which have been stalled in the Senate because of GOP opposition. ""Morning Joe"" co-host Joe Scarborough, a former GOP congressman from Florida, asserted that the Senate is ""operating in bad faith"" and does not want to pass voting rights. He pointed to a deal struck in the chamber between both parties that allowed for a one-time exemption of the filibuster to raise the debt ceiling earlier this month. Ocasio-Cortez agreed with Scarborough's analysis before knocking Republicans for threatening filibusters. ""This idea that again, over time, has switched from talking filibuster to now just being able to stand up and posture and make a threat, God forbid that they might actually have to show up and stand or sit and actually have to talk and actually live out the threat of their filibuster,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""It is unconscionable, the way that the Senate operates, it's fundamentally undemocratic,"" she added. ""We are in a crisis. Nineteen states have passed over 33 laws to limit or restrict the right to vote in the United States of America. We are beyond the time for something to pass. And my concern is that even Manchin's compromise, or the fact that he was making statements just this past week that he was just having conversations with the parliamentarian about voting rights that were illuminating. How has this not happened all year long,"" she added. Ocasio-Cortez also said President Biden needs to ""be more forceful on the filibuster"" and lean ""on his executive authority and say, 'if you're going to get in the way, we're going to find other ways to do this,' and it's either you're either with us or you're not with us, but this train is moving and we need to govern because the United States House of Representatives is delivering an agenda for the people."" ""We cannot blame Mitch McConnell, and we cannot blame Joe Manchin either, because we have tools at our disposal with a trifecta,"" she added.",Politics/The Hill,Ocasio-Cortez: Democrats need to to 'crack down' on 'old boys club' in Senate,https://news.yahoo.com/ocasio-cortez-democrats-crack-down-163126272.html
