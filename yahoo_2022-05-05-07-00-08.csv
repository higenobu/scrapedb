5/5/2022,"The 17-second video shows the moment drones hit two Russian Raptor fast-attack craft. The Russian patrol boats were destroyed in the Black Sea near Snake Island, a strategic and symbolic location for Ukraine. The drone used to sink the Russian ships is known as Bayraktar TB2, built by Turkey. Ukraine said on Monday its drones sank two Russian ships in the Black Sea near Snake Island, which the Russians had captured the day the war broke out on February 24. ""Two Russian Raptor boats were destroyed at daybreak today near Snake Island,"" Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Gen. Valerii Zaluzhnyi wrote on social media platforms. ""#bayraktar is doing its job,"" he continued, referring to the Turkish unmanned combat aerial vehicle known as the Bayraktar TB2, that reportedly helped sink the two Russian Raptor fast-attack craft. Along with the message, Zaluzhnyi posted a 17-second video that allegedly shows the moment the drones hit the Russian raptors at 4:51 am local time. Russia made no comment on Ukraine's claim, the Wall Street Journal reported, but said it destroyed three Bayraktar drones without providing any evidence. Raptor-class boats are 55-foot-long vessels armed with machine guns that are used for patrol missions, with a crew of three and space to ferry up to 20 troops. Although it is small – only 42 acres – Snake Island is strategically important because it sits at the edge of Ukraine's territorial waters in the Black Sea. A report last year from non-partisan think tank the Atlantic Council called Snake Island the ""key to Ukraine's maritime territorial claims"" in the Black Sea. Snake Island has also become a legendary symbol of resistance for Ukraine, as military defending the island refused to surrender to Russian forces on February 24, radioing ""Russian warship go screw yourself,"" when the Russian flagship cruiser Moskva approached. The patrol boat losses add to the mounting toll for the Russian Navy. In April, the Moskva sank after being hit with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile, the Pentagon confirmed.

5/5/2022,"A priceless work of Roman art went missing after World War II— until it was sold for $34.99 at a Goodwill store in Texas. The marble bust, titled simply “Portrait of a man,” was sculpted some time in the 1st century B.C. or early A.D., according to the San Antonio Museum of Art, where it is on display as of May 4. How it traveled 2,000 years and untold miles to a resale store in Austin is a mystery only partially unraveled. Experts believe that the sculpture was looted from a German museum after WWII and taken home by a U.S. soldier, according to the SA Museum of Art. But what happened between then and it’s arrival at Goodwill decades later is anyone’s guess. Laura Young, of Austin, found the marble man looking up at her from beneath a table at local Goodwill in 2018, dirty and disheveled, a yellow price tag on his cheek, she told The Art Newspaper. She bought the man, buckled him in the backseat and drove off. After bringing the bust home, Young started to do a little research, Texas Public Radio reported. Soon realizing the marble man may be more valuable than he initially seemed, she reached out to an auction house in London, which confirmed the sculpture was likely ancient, and almost certainly looted. It possibly depicts Drusus Germanicus, a respected Roman general. It was last cataloged at the Pompejanum in Germany, the outlet reported. Modeled after a Pompeeian villa, the Pompejanum museum housed a great deal of art from all over Europe, but was caught in the crossfire between U.S. and Nazi forces in the waning days of the war — an easy target for any soldiers with opportunistic tendencies. Young reached out to an attorney in New York, Leila Amineddoleh, who specializes in art, The Art Newspaper reported. “US law doesn’t recognize the transfer of title when theft is involved,” Amineddoleh said. “I advised Laura not to sell it, either publicly or privately, that is, on the black market. She risked expensive legal battles or criminal penalties if she tried.” Instead, they contacted German authorities, who were very interested in seeing the bust returned. The Bavarian Administration of State-Owned Palaces, Gardens and Lakes agreed to pay Young a finders fee, and to allow the San Antonio Museum of Art to display the bust temporarily, Amineddoleh told the outlet, adding that the last of the documents were finalized just days ago. “What is very unusual is that most instances of looting were committed by the Nazis — it is estimated that 20% of all the art in Europe was looted by the Nazis,” Amineddoleh said. “However, this bust of Drusus Germanicus was most likely looted by a member of the Allied forces.” The bust was revealed at the San Antonio Museum of Art on May 4, and will remain on display there until May 21, 2023.

5/5/2022,"A Taiwanese father from the Xinying district in Tainan City abused his 1-month-old baby for looking like his grandfather, according to authorities.

The unidentified man in his 30s allegedly beat his son in the abdomen with his fists and a towel every time the infant would cry, reported The Standard.

His wife secretly filmed him abusing their son and sent it to her mother on Monday, saying, “I’m so scared, save my son.”

Police responded to a report the next morning and arrested the father. He was recently sent to Tainan District Prosecutors Office for “domestic violence and child abuse,” where he was ruled to be remanded.

The infant was brought to a hospital for examination. He suffers from a large bruise on his chest and an overly high liver index, suggesting that he may have been poisoned.

The father, who also has two daughters, was said to have previously abused his children with his first wife.

The man’s family were granted emergency protection orders by the Tainan City Government Bureau of Social Affairs.

The case is under investigation by local forces. It has been reported to social welfare administration organizations.

5/5/2022,"A top U.S. military official in charge of joint training between American and Ukrainian troops in Germany relayed a message Wednesday that ""the worst thing the Russians did was give us eight years to prepare"" for its invasion of Ukraine. Brig. Gen. Joseph E. Hilbert had been relaying a message from a Ukrainian official, the 7th Army Training Command told Fox News. Hilbert, the commanding general for the 7th Army Training Command, also said Ukraine has participated in more than a dozen large exercises with U.S. troops in Germany since 2015. ""The Ukrainian soldiers are motivated, they are professional,"" Hilbert added, noting that the U.S. is currently training 50 to 60 Ukrainian soldiers on how to operate M777 howitzer artillery in Grafenwoehr, Germany.

Hilbert also said the U.S. has trained more than 23,000 members of Ukraine's armed forces from 17 different battalions and 11 different brigades, spending a total of $126 million on this program. He added that the U.S. was planning for Ukrainian troops to lead a division-level exercise across the country before over 160 Florida National Guard troops pulled out of Ukraine in February, days before the invasion began.
