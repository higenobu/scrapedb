3/27/2022,"By Andrius Sytas VILNIUS (Reuters) - ""Dear passengers of train no. 29, Moscow-Kaliningrad. Today, Putin is killing civilians in Ukraine. Do you support this?"" an announcer repeats in Russian at Vilnius station while the service stops there. Two dozen large pictures from the war in Ukraine, each with the same message, were put up on Friday morning on either side of the platform reserved for the Russian transit trains. The trains, up to six per day, pause for around 10 minutes in Vilnius, capital of EU-member Lithuania, as they pass to and from Russia's Kaliningrad exclave - sandwiched between Lithuania and Poland - and cities such as Moscow and St Petersburg, via Belarus. Under a two decade old agreement between Lithuania, Russia and the European Union, passengers are issued Lithuanian visas for the transit-only services, which are powered by a Lithuanian locomotive for the portion of the journey inside the country. ""As far as we know, Russians are shielded from what is happening in Ukraine. Here in Vilnius railway station, we have a possibility to show at least a small piece of what is happening,"" Mantas Dubauskas, a spokesperson for the state-owned Lithuanian railways, said. ""It's the least that we can do,"" he added. ""Maybe we can change the minds of a very small number of passengers"". The pictures, provided by Ukrainian photographers, show the dead and injured, people grieving, destroyed buildings and bridges, and refugees with small children escaping the country. Moscow calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"" to disarm its neighbour. The Kremlin says Russian forces have not targeted civilians. Russia's parliament this month passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally ""fake"" news about the military. Russian officials have said that false information has been spread by Russia's enemies such as the United States and its Western European allies in an attempt to sow discord among the Russian people. There were no people seen at the windows of the train on Friday morning. No one disembarked from or joined the service as no tickets have been sold to and from the station for the Russian trains since the COVID-19 lockdown in early 2020. It was not known how many passengers were on the train. Russian aircraft between Kaliningrad and Russia fly over the international waters of the Baltic Sea, prolonging the journey, after Lithuania and other EU countries banned them from their airspace in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine.

3/27/2022,"(Reuters) - Russia plans to establish a reserve fleet of railway wagons for ""state tasks"", according to a letter seen by Reuters, as state needs expand because of its military operation in Ukraine. Valentina Matviyenko, chair of the upper house of parliament and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said this week that, as Russia now had a ""mobilisation economy"", private rail firms should support state interests and allow Russian Railways to use their wagons. The letter, dated March 22, says the reserve railcars would enable ""transportation of socially significant cargoes"" and asks Russian Railways, the federal anti-monopoly service, the ministry of transport and the main industry association to respond by April 10. None of these responded to a Reuters request for comment. State monopoly Russian Railways controls tracks and infrastructure, but the more than 1.1 million rail wagons in Russia are majority-owned by private firms including Freight One, Globaltrans, Transcontainer and the Russian Railways subsidiary, Federal Freight. Matviyenko said she planned to ask the Security Council - which is chaired by Putin and advises him on policy including the use of Russian military forces abroad - to look into private rail operators. The head of Russian Railways, Oleg Belozerov, told Security Council members on Tuesday that the state operator should be given about 10% of the existing fleet to use. Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbourâ€™s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.
