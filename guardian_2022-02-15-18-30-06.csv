2/15/2022,"A senior Metropolitan police officer has said racism is a problem in the country’s largest force. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Bas Javid, the brother of the health secretary, Sajid Javid, acknowledged “people who have racist views and are racist” were among the force’s staff.  When asked on BBC Newsnight if he accepted racism “is a problem in the Metropolitan police”, Javid replied: “Yes, I do.” His comments came after Cressida Dick resigned as commissioner of the Met amid allegations of a toxic culture within the force including racism and misogyny among officers. Javid told the programme: “Let me be really clear on this: there’s absolutely no room for racism in policing, and especially here in the Metropolitan police. We made that very, very clear to our people, anyone who works for us and demonstrates any type of racism or discrimination behaviour will be removed from the organisation.” Javid, who has served in three police force areas over 28 years as an officer, said he was “extremely disappointed” to hear interviews on the programme with two black colleagues who said discrimination was getting worse. “You know, we’ve done a huge amount of work over a long period of time to make it one absolutely clear stance for anti-racism, and zero tolerance on any form of discrimination,” the officer told Newsnight. “And the fact that you’ve had officers or staff come to you to make allegations, what I’d like to see is an organisation where people feel comfortable to come forward, and report it and deal with it effectively.” He said it would be “wrong for me to stand here and say to you I haven’t seen examples of racism in my 28 years – absolutely I have”. “But my preferred place would be to be in the organisation doing everything I can to root out racism or any form of discrimination,” he said. Javid added: “Now, what I would say is there are people who have racist views and are racist, and they are in the police. But what I won’t do is describe all of the organisation as a racist organisation. I think that’s extremely unfair to so many people who work extremely hard to do what I talked about today, which is rooting out racism and other forms of discrimination.” Dick in August 2020 denied the force was institutionally racist, saying it adopted a zero tolerance approach to the issue. On the issue of police stop and search, she said young black men were “hugely disproportionately stabbed and killed” and “hugely tangled up” in the criminal justice system.",News/UK news,Senior Met officer acknowledges racism problem in UK’s largest force,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/15/senior-met-officer-acknowledges-racism-problem-force-bas-javid
2/15/2022,"Scott Morrison has urged colleagues to ramp up examples of “sharp contrast” with Labor as the opposition signalled it could support a strengthening of the character test legislation despite previously helping to scuttle the proposal in the Senate. The prime minister has revived the Coalition’s character test bill in the hope of wedging Labor on national security in the final sitting weeks of the current parliament. Morrison is attempting to regroup politically after an internal revolt scuttled his signature religious discrimination legislation last week.  The “character test” policy as it stands automatically cancels the visas of non-citizens, primarily New Zealand citizens, who are sentenced to more than 12 months in jail. The proposed bill would lower the bar for the automatic failure of the test. Labor has previously objected to elements of the character test proposal and a government-controlled parliamentary committee on human rights concluded in December it was not clear there was a “pressing and substantial need for the measures in this bill”. But Morrison declared candidly in Tuesday’s penultimate party room meeting the character test bill presented the best point of contrast with Labor in the government’s legislative arsenal. It highlighted the “risks” associated with any change of government. Morrison told MPs that in order to win the election contest in May, the government needed to put “the starkness of the choice in front of the Australian people”. The prime minister said: “I know how to do that, and I know that is how you win elections. I know what the path is and I’ll be following it.” Labor – which avoided a wedge on religious discrimination last week because of government division – was meeting on Tuesday afternoon to resolve its position on the character test proposal. Ahead of those deliberations, the shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, would not rule out waving the visa cancellation bill through parliament. She declared Morrison was pursuing a fight rather than a fix and “playing a political wedge game”. After the public split over religious discrimination last week and subsequent back-biting inside the government, Morrison warned colleagues on Tuesday to pull their heads in. The prime minister said between now and the election, the government had a job to do: “I’m going to do mine, I need you to do yours.” While telling colleagues disunity would cost the Coalition government, Morrison acknowledged his own focus on the looming political battle needed to be sharper. “You haven’t seen me as focused as I can be yet,” he told colleagues, adding “you will see it”. Morrison said if the government was focused and professional, and if MPs supported each other, the Coalition would win the coming election. “I know where we are going,” Morrison declared. “We will get there.” With Labor ahead in the polls, and with the government battling splits and leaks, Morrison and the defence minister, Peter Dutton, have ramped up the rhetoric on security, declaring Beijing wants Labor to win the election. Last week, Dutton said in parliament China had picked Anthony Albanese as its election candidate. The obvious partisanship attracted an implicit rebuke from the head of Australia’s domestic spy, Mike Burgess. During an appearance before Senate estimates on Monday night, Burgess declared that his intelligence agency was “not here to be politicised”. On Tuesday, the foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, declined to repeat Morrison’s claim that a Labor government would stand for “appeasement” of China. When asked whether it was in the national interest for the Coalition to portray Labor as being compromised by China given that it may win government at the election, Payne made a generic statement that it was “essential for those who wish to govern our nation to be clear and to be consistent”. While she repeated the Coalition’s criticism of the former Labor government for a drop in defence spending as a share of GDP – and insisted it was fair enough to indicate “where we believe our strengths lie” – Payne dodged multiple opportunities to specifically endorse the appeasement claim. Payne met with her counterparts from the US, Japan and India for a Quad meeting in Melbourne on Friday. She was urged by Prof Rory Medcalf, head of the Australian National University’s National Security College, to “reassure her Quad counterparts they can have confidence in Australia as a security partner, no matter who wins government”. For years, Payne said, she had reassured Quad partners and other close partners “of Australia’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific” and that it was “a solid partner”. In Tuesday’s Sky News interview, she did not add any caveats about whether that might change with a change of government.

2/15/2022,"Workers at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, have begun the rerun of a historic union election after the US labor regulator ruled Amazon’s conduct had interfered with a previous election in 2021 and ordered a new vote. The union drive comes as other large US employers including Starbucks and Target are fighting off union drives. If successful, the warehouse would be the first Amazon facility to unionize in the US. Employees said that Amazon – which now employs more than 1 million people in the US – is fighting hard to make sure this vote also fails, but some are feeling more confident the second time around.  Darryl Richardson, an employee at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer for two years, said workers and organizers are now more apt to resist Amazon’s union-busting efforts. “They’re still using the same scare tactics they used last time, but due to the first election, you have employees who understand and know that Amazon isn’t telling them the truth,” said Richardson. “I feel better this time than I did the first time. Employees have been voicing their opinions and standing strong this election.” More than 6,100 workers are eligible to vote in the union election, which will determine if workers will be represented by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). Due to high employee turnover, almost half of the eligible workers in this election were not working at Amazon during the first union election. Ballots were sent to Alabama workers on 4 February, with ballots due to be returned by 25 March. Results will be tallied beginning on 28 March. Two other Amazon warehouses, JFK8 and LDJ5 in Staten Island, New York, have filed petitions to hold union elections with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), though election dates have not been set by the NLRB regional director. Perry Connelly, 59, who has worked in outbound stowing at the Bessemer warehouse for two years, said that organizing ahead of the first union election started off well, with a majority of workers signing union authorization cards, but that Amazon’s aggressive anti-union campaign and promises of improvements confused or deterred many workers from voting at all or persuaded them to vote against the union. “We just want Amazon to be held accountable for all the things that make the job, the workplace, unbearable,” said Connelly. “What we do and what we put out, Amazon can pay a lot better and not have such a high rate of turnover of employees. A lot of people come in and they’re not there for six or seven months, they don’t make it that long because of the working conditions.” Rerun union elections are relatively rare, with unions prevailing in a slim majority of those elections in recent years. But Connelly claimed this time around, there’s more support for the union. He said many workers switched from voting no in the first election to supporting it, because Amazon didn’t fulfill the promises they made during the first election, and the union organizing campaign has expanded to handing out union T-shirts, door-knocking efforts that weren’t possible earlier in the Covid-19 pandemic, and partnering with other local unions and community groups. Connelly cited issues such as better pay, better promotional opportunities, more respect from management toward workers and less hostility toward productivity rates as a few of the reasons he is supporting the union. “We’re not asking for a lot. We’re just asking for better conditions and less work hassle. We feel like we’re in a hostile work environment day in and day out,” said Connelly. “Working for Amazon, no one should be worried about paying bills when you work for a multibillionaire, and we just want what we think is fair.” US businesses have fought hard against union drives in recent years. A 2019 report by the Economic Policy Institute found that 41.5% of employers had violated federal labor law in union election campaigns and employers spend about $340m annually on union avoidance, issues that have driven campaigns for federal labor law reforms to expand workers’ rights and steepen penalties for employers violating labor laws. As part of the new election ruling, Amazon reached a settlement with the NLRB, agreeing to refrain from threatening workers with discipline or calling the police on workers engaging in union activity outside the warehouse. If Amazon is found to violate the settlement, the NLRB could more easily sue the company. Amazon is once again aggressively opposing the unionization effort at the warehouse, with regular anti-union meetings where outside consultants and managers are encouraging workers to vote against the union. A worker at the Bessemer warehouse has already filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB against Amazon, alleging the settlement was violated because he claims management warned him about speaking with co-workers about the union. During the first union election, Amazon installed a United States Postal Service mailbox in front of the warehouse, surrounded by signs encouraging workers to vote no in the election. That mailbox was a significant factor in the first union election being overturned by the NLRB. The union has already made a request for review to the NLRB of objectionable conduct over the mailbox, as it remains on site at the warehouse, but was just moved to a different location. The union argued the mailbox undermined the election as it is subject to constant surveillance by the company, and the stigma surrounding the mailbox as employer-controlled remains. The NLRB ruled the claims would be resolved after the new election. Contacted by the Guardian, Amazon did not comment on how its conduct this election has changed from the previous one. A spokesperson said in an email: “Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU last year. We look forward to our team in BHM1 having their voices heard again.”",News/Technology,US Amazon warehouse workers prepare for historic union vote,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/15/amazon-union-vote-workers-prepare
2/15/2022,"Up to a fifth of UK households have struggled to pay their TV, internet and phone bills in the last year, with some having to cancel services or cut back spending on essentials such as food and clothing to make payments, according to research by Ofcom. The telecoms regulator’s annual affordability report highlights the rising pressure on household finances, with consumers facing a further inflation-busting increase in mobile, telephone and broadband bills of as much as 10% this year.  “People rely on their broadband for staying in touch, working and learning from home,” said Lindsey Fussell, group director of network and communications at Ofcom. “But for those who are really struggling with rising bills, every penny counts.” Ofcom warned that with the above-inflation price increases outstripping expected rises in benefits such as universal credit, more than 4m homes are facing the prospect of a further fall in income in real terms. “This could increase the numbers of households that face affordability challenges in accessing internet services and further increase the challenges of those who already face affordability issues,” Ofcom said. “These challenges could be exacerbated by the wider context of cost of living pressures across a range of essential services (including rising energy prices) during the course of 2022.” However, the regulator’s research also found that millions of families under pressure from the rising cost of living are not taking advantage of cheaper “social tariffs” offered by some providers to homes on benefits. Ofcom estimates that 4.2m homes are eligible to move on to social tariffs – offered by six broadband providers including BT, Virgin Media O2, Community Fibre, G.Network, Hyperoptic and KCOM – which could halve their bills, providing a saving of £144 annually. According to its research, only 55,000 homes have taken advantage of these tariffs, just 1.2% of those eligible. About 5% of households, 1.1m, are struggling to pay for their broadband each month, the same proportion as face issues paying their mobile bills, Ofcom found. Ofcom said that while some firms were offering social tariffs they were not actively promoting them to eligible customers in advertising or price comparison website searches. “Special discounts can make all the difference, and too many broadband firms are failing either to promote their social tariff or to offer one at all,” Fussell said. “We expect companies to step up support for those on low incomes, and we’ll be watching their response.”",News/Business,"Many UK homes cut back on essentials to pay for TV, phones and internet",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/15/uk-homes-cut-essentials-to-pay-for-tv-phones-and-internet
2/15/2022,"The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has warned of a “dangerous moment for the world” as the “highly likely” prospect of a Russian invasion of Ukraine could embolden other countries such as Iran and China to expand their ambitions. Speaking on Sky News, Truss said “we could be on the brink of a war in Europe, which would have severe consequences not just for the people of Russian and Ukraine but for the broader security in Europe”, adding she was “very worried”.  Her comments came as last-ditch efforts for a diplomatic situation to the crisis on the Russia-Ukraine border are sought by world leaders including Boris Johnson and Joe Biden. A core pillar of the dispute is Russia’s demand for the west to guarantee Ukraine will not join Nato, the defensive alliance of 30 countries. Truss has said it was not for Russia to determine Ukraine’s security arrangements. She said: “The big risk is if there is an invasion into Ukraine. That would be hugely damaging for Russia and Ukraine, and it would further undermine stability in Europe. “President Putin has actively questioned why other countries in eastern Europe are members of Nato as well, so this I fear would not stop at Ukraine. “This is an attack on the neighbouring states of Russia and other east European countries in trying to undermine the legitimacy of them being part of Nato.” Asked to expand on this point, the foreign secretary said: “If we saw an invasion into Ukraine, there would be severe costs in terms of a long-running conflict. We could see the undermining of security more broadly in Europe, we could also see other aggressors around the world see it as an opportunity to expand their ambitions too so this is a very dangerous moment for the world.” Asked to which other countries she was referring, Truss cited Iran and China as examples of potential aggressors. Russia has amassed 100,000 troops on the Ukrainian border and Truss said an invasion of the country “could be imminent and it is highly likely”. She said any conflict could be a “long, protracted war”. When asked on Times Radio whether Russia had the military capacity to take and hold all of Ukraine, Truss said: “What we know is that the Ukrainians will fight. The UK has trained up 20,000 Ukrainian soldiers. “We’ve supplied defensive weapons as have other allies. So, this will not be easy or simple for Vladimir Putin. This could be a long, protracted war, which would, of course, create huge damage for both the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia as well as threatening European security.” However, Truss said Putin could still “change his mind”. She added: “We know or we believe that Vladimir Putin has not yet made a decision about whether to invade Ukraine. We think it’s highly likely. “There are huge numbers of troops lined up on the border. We know that they’re in a position to attack imminently, but he can still change his mind and that is why diplomacy is so vital.”",News/World news,"Russia-Ukraine crisis a ‘dangerous moment for the world’, warns Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/russia-ukraine-crisis-dangerous-moment-world-warns-liz-truss
2/15/2022,"The ex-wife of decorated war veteran Ben Roberts-Smith suspected he had been burying their money in the backyard when she uncovered a secret cache of USBs buried in a child’s lunchbox hidden under a rock, a court has heard. Over two days of evidence in the federal court, Emma Roberts denied in court she was seeking revenge against the Victoria Cross winner, saying: “I hope Ben survives this nightmare.”  She told the court she believed Roberts-Smith was withdrawing cash from their joint bank accounts during the breakdown of their marriage and secretly burying it in the garden.“He used to be out in the garden burying things,” she told the court. Roberts described in court a “very obvious” location hidden underneath a rock and a hose reel where she and a family friend, Danielle Scott, dug with a pitchfork, uncovering a child’s lunchbox with pink clasps. Inside were “four or five” USBs inside clear snaplock bags, she said.Scott took the USBs and downloaded their contents on to a laptop before the pair re-buried the USBs, the court was told. “I said ‘I do not want to see what’s on them’,” Roberts told the court. The court was played a 60 Minutes report from 2021 that detailed the alleged burial of the USBs. Roberts denied she was the source of information to Nine’s journalists. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. In evidence before court last year, Roberts-Smith said he was anonymously sent a number of USBs containing pictures, video and classified reports from his service in Afghanistan after he asked former colleagues for information that could help his defamation action against three newspapers he alleges defamed him by accusing him of war crimes. Roberts-Smith said he never buried the USBs, but that they were kept in his desk at the home he had shared with his wife. The court has previously heard the USBs contained operational reports from SAS missions in southern Afghanistan, drone footage of military operations and classified photographs. The court heard it included hundreds of photos of SAS soldiers drinking in the Fat Ladies Arms, an unofficial bar at the Australian military base in Afghanistan, including photos of troops (not including Roberts-Smith) drinking from a prosthetic leg allegedly taken from a slain Afghan national, who the newspapers allege was shot by Roberts-Smith. Roberts-Smith says the man was an insurgent killed in the heat of battle.In court Tuesday, Roberts was cross-examined about access to her husband’s email account. As a director of the company she ran with her husband – RS Group – Roberts told the court she had access to all company emails.Roberts told the court Scott was also given the password to access the email address by Roberts-Smith to deal with correspondence from Person 17, the woman with whom Roberts-Smith had allegedly been having an affair. Roberts said she and Roberts-Smith did not want any contact with Person 17 after that relationship ended, and wanted a third party to correspond with Scott.Bruce McClintock, acting for Roberts-Smith, suggested that Scott and Roberts read Roberts-Smith’s emails for months, an act that was “sneaky and dishonest”, an electronic equivalent to “eavesdropping”.“I don’t believe so,” Roberts said.Roberts was questioned about her text message correspondence with Scott, comparing, in one exchange, her husband’s career to the Titanic – that is, destined to sink.“He’s a lying cheating cunt,” Roberts said in another exchange.She told the court: “I was very frustrated with Ben at the time. I was very frustrated in a bitter divorce.” McClintock put it to Roberts her evidence was untrue and “an exercise in rank hypocrisy”. “No.”Roberts rejected assertions she was motivated by revenge, saying she was appearing because she had been subpoenaed.“I hope Ben survives this nightmare,” she said.Roberts was cross-examined over her contacts with journalists, telling the court she had had several meetings with reporters, and their lawyers once she was subpoenaed, but she did not provide information or documents for stories.
