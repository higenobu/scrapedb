4/29/2022,"Keir Starmer and senior shadow cabinet ministers have launched a major charm offensive hosting officials from Israel’s Labor party, including taking them door-knocking for the local elections in Barnet, north London. In move designed to underline the contrast with Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership, Starmer and Rayner have hosted nine officials including the deputy mayor of Tel Aviv, Chen Arieli, the party’s chief executive, Nir Rosen, and senior staffers from the Israeli leader’s office. The Guardian understands the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, hosted the delegation for dinner and the group also met the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, and discussed campaign tactics with senior figures in Labour HQ including the general secretary, David Evans, and Morgan McSweeney. Though they have long been “sister parties”, the previous leader Avi Gabbay cut ties with Corbyn in 2018 over the handling of antisemitism. Once a dominant force in the country, Israel’s Labor has also been in political turmoil, suffering some of its worst results in multiple elections over the past few years, though it is now part of the shaky governing coalition with a small increase in seats. Jonathan Cummings, international adviser to the Israeli Labor leader, Merav Michaeli, said it was a “great relief” to be in contact with the party and said they were struck by the time they had been given by senior politicians. “Our main concern was always about antisemitism and the Jewish community – anti-Israel, anti-Zionism, that was almost a secondary issues. We wanted to be on the right side, supporting the community here,” he said. Cummings said Starmer had been delighted to see them join activists hoping to take back Barnet council, where Labour underperformed in 2018. Jewish Labour activists had described encountering significant anger on the doorsteps in Barnet in 2018. Party sources hope any gains will be a major story of next week’s election results to show how the party is changing. Starmer has repeatedly said he intends to rid the party of any antisemitic members, in the wake of the equalities watchdog report which criticised the handling of complaints. Corbyn has been suspended from the Labour whip for his reaction to that report and Starmer also sacked his shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey for praising an interview which compared Israeli police tactics to the murder of George Floyd. Both have drawn significant criticism from the party’s left. Starmer has also shown an uncompromising attitude towards pro-Palestinian activism since he was elected leader. He said he did not accept the findings of an Amnesty International report that Israel was an apartheid state. Its report found there was “institutionalised and prolonged racist oppression of millions of people”. Michael Rubin, director of Labour Friends of Israel, said the visit was “an important landmark in the rebuilding of the deep and historic relationship with our sister party”.",News/Politics,Keir Starmer hosts Israeli Labor party in charm offensive ahead of local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/28/keir-starmer-hosts-israeli-labor-party-in-charm-offensive-ahead-of-local-elections
4/29/2022,"“We’re a cash machine at these types of prices,” Bernard Looney, BP’s chief executive, cheerfully declared last November when the price of a barrel of Brent fetched $85 (£60). Now a barrel costs $105, so it’s safe to predict that BP will be swimming in dollars when it reports first-quarter profits next Tuesday, even allowing for its well-flagged whack from getting out of Russia. The billions on show on Thursday at Shell, the larger company, will be even greater. Cue another round of debate about the merits of a windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers. Thus Rishi Sunak, at the very least, was being politically smart this week in fudging his stance. The chancellor has previously been a firm opponent of a windfall tax, arguing it would discourage investment, the very thing he is trying to accelerate during an energy crisis that is partly about security of supply. Now he’s not so sure, or so he seemed to suggest to the Mumsnet website. “Nothing is ever off the table” if companies don’t ramp up investment in new projects, he said. A U-turn still feels a long way off given the force of past statements; and note that Sunak’s interesting remark was preceded by a longer defence about why he hasn’t taken the windfall route, and how oil and gas producers are already paying tax at an effective rate of 40%. Perhaps the comment was just a prod to Looney to stop boasting about his cash machine and start hyping the BP billions going into UK windfarms, carbon-capture projects, hydrogen developments and electric charging points. Yet one comes back to that high oil price – or, rather, to its persistence. It is impossible to be precise about the “war in Ukraine premium” in current oil and gas prices, but it obviously exists – and it is a premium being enjoyed by companies and being paid by consumers. The longer it lasts, the harder it is to resist rejigging the balance in the interest of fairness. Yes, the companies would grumble. But, if the sum was as little as £3bn, as some models suggest, the bleating would quickly fade as long as windfall taxes were still seen to apply only rarely. Boards would get back to modelling returns over a decade, which is what really drives their investment decisions. Having opened the door, Sunak would be wise to keep it open. Come the autumn, when consumers’ bills will rise again, the political pressure may be overwhelming. Supermarkets are a good place for investors to hide during periods of high inflation, runs traditional thinking, since food is always in demand and higher prices on shelves should eventually provide some protection. Life is more complicated, however, when inflation combines with a cost of living squeeze and a possible consumer recession. Sainsbury’s comments about “significant external pressures and uncertainties” says the outlook is genuinely unclear. In the absence of a takeover bid – on which front, the chat has gone quiet after last year’s entertainment at Asda and Morrisons – it’s a case of giving thanks for the dividend, lifted by almost a quarter with Thursday’s full-year numbers. Pre-tax profits in the current financial year are predicted to fall from £730m to anywhere between £630m and £690m, a wide range that was reflected in Sainsbury’s chief executive Simon Roberts’ description of consumers’ mood. In the same sentence, he used “early signs” of caution, which sounds tolerable from the point of view of the shopkeeper, and “watching every penny, every pound”, which is several notches more severe. Sainsbury’s is far from helpless, it should be said. It can find cost savings, as it always does, and the Argos combo should have more efficiencies to yield. Confidence that free cashflow this year will be “at least” £500m provides freedom to react to events – certainly more freedom than enjoyed by the heavily indebted buyout brigade. Sainsbury’s balance sheet is strong, a slice of market share has been gained and the freshly tweaked dividend policy is to be slightly more generous with the payout as a proportion of earnings. So, yes, the investment caricature of stability is roughly intact. But one can also see why the shares, down 4%, were the biggest faller in the FTSE 100 index. Boards everywhere in retail-land are erring on the side of caution amid uncertainty, and may be right to do so.",News/Business,Rishi Sunak would do well to stick with windfall tax U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/28/rishi-sunak-would-do-well-to-stick-with-windfall-tax-u-turn
4/29/2022,"Global heating is causing such a drastic change to the world’s oceans that it risks a mass extinction event of marine species that rivals anything that’s happened in the Earth’s history over tens of millions of years, new research has warned. Accelerating climate change is causing a “profound” impact upon ocean ecosystems that is “driving extinction risk higher and marine biological richness lower than has been seen in Earth’s history for the past tens of millions of years”, according to the study. The world’s seawater is steadily climbing in temperature due to the extra heat produced from the burning of fossil fuels, while oxygen levels in the ocean are plunging and the water is acidifying from the soaking up of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This means the oceans are overheated, increasingly gasping for breath – the volume of ocean waters completely depleted of oxygen has quadrupled since the 1960s – and becoming more hostile to life. Aquatic creatures such as clams, mussels and shrimp are unable to properly form shells due to the acidification of seawater. All of this means the planet could slip into a “mass extinction rivaling those in Earth’s past”, states the new research, published in Science. The pressures of rising heat and loss of oxygen are, researchers said, uncomfortably reminiscent of the mass extinction event that occurred at the end of the Permian period about 250m years ago. This cataclysm, known as the “great dying”, led to the demise of up to 96% of the planet’s marine animals. “Even if the magnitude of species loss is not the same level as this, the mechanism of the species loss would be the same,” said Justin Penn, a climate scientist at Princeton University who co-authored the new research. “The future of life in the oceans rests strongly on what we decide to do with greenhouse gases today. There are two vastly different oceans we could be seeing, one devoid of a lot of life we see today, depending on what we see with CO2 emissions moving forward.” Truly catastrophic extinction levels may be reached should the world emit planet-heating gases in an unrestrained way, leading to more than 4C of average warming above pre-industrial times by the end of this century, the research found. This would trigger extinctions that would reshape ocean life for several more centuries as temperatures continue to climb. But even in the better case scenarios, the world is still set to lose a significant chunk of its marine life. At 2C of heating above the pre-industrial norm, which is forecast as likely even under current climate pledges by the world’s governments, around 4% of the roughly two million species in the oceans will be wiped out. Fish and marine mammals that live in polar regions are most vulnerable, according to the study, as they will be unable to migrate to suitably cooler climes, unlike tropical species. “They will just have nowhere to go,” said Penn. The threat of climate change is amplifying the other major dangers faced by aquatic life, such as over-fishing and pollution. Between 10% and 15% of marine species are already at risk of extinction because of these various threats, the study found, drawing upon International Union for Conservation of Nature data. John Bruno, a marine ecologist at the University of North Carolina who was not involved in the study, said the new research appeared “sound” but it differed from previous studies on the topic that suggest species will mainly disperse to new areas rather than be completely snuffed out. “It’s very different from what most prior work has developed. But that doesn’t mean they are wrong,” Bruno said. “I think this new work is challenging some of our current assumptions about the geographic patterns of looming extinction in the ocean.” Bruno said that while mass extinctions are likely from extreme heating in the future, the current impacts from climate change and other threats should be concerning enough for policymakers and the public. “Personally, I’m a lot more worried about the ecosystem degradation we’re already seeing after less than 1C of warming,” he said. “We don’t need to look to a world so warmed over humanity has been wiped out – we’re already losing untold biodiversity and ecosystem functioning with even the relatively modest warming of the last 50 years.”",News/Environment,Global warming risks most cataclysmic extinction of marine life in 250m years,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/28/global-warming-risks-cataclysmic-mass-extinction-marine-life
4/29/2022,"From sociable labradors to aggressive pitbulls, when it comes to canine behaviour there are no end of stereotypes. But research suggests such traits may have less to do with breed than previously thought. Modern dog breeds began to emerge in the Victorian era and are often physically distinct – for example, great danes are huge and chihuahuas tiny. But it has often been thought breed can predict behaviour, too. Now researchers say there’s little sign that’s the case. Dr Elinor Karlsson of the University of Massachusetts Umass Chan medical school, a co-author of the study, said research revealed a huge diversity of behaviours within each breed. “Even if the average is different, you’ve still got a really good chance of getting a dog that doesn’t match what people say that breed is supposed to be,” she said. Writing in the journal Science, the US researchers report how they analysed survey responses relating to the physical traits and behaviour of 18,385 pet dogs, almost half of which were purebred, with genetic data analysed for 2,155 of them. Analysis of the survey results for purebred dogs suggested about 9% of behavioural variation was explained by breed. “For the most part, we didn’t see strong differences in breeds, but there are some [behaviours] that are connected to breed more than others,” said Karlsson. While no behaviour was exclusive to one breed, howling was more common among beagles, while pitbulls and retrievers were more “human sociable”, or comfortable with strangers. There were also some differences based on dogs’ ancestral functions. For example, herding breeds were, among other traits, more biddable. But there was a high degree of variability between individuals, meaning it is difficult to predict a dog’s behaviour based on its breed. To explore whether genetics explained the associations, the team analysed the behaviour of mutts that had different levels of ancestry from particular breeds. The results reveal some traits have a stronger genetic component than others. Labrador retriever ancestry was associated with mutts who had few qualms about getting wet, yet such ancestry appeared to have no link to human sociability. “We’d expect that if Labrador retrievers are genetically more human social, we should see that mutts with more Labrador retriever ancestry to be more human social,” said Karlsson. While the team’s other analyses found human sociability is highly heritable, Karlsson noted the mutt results suggest the genetic variants involved do not appear to be more common in particular breeds. Instead, differences between breeds for this trait may be down to environmental influences, or even owners’ perceptions. But not all behaviours were found to be heritable, including how easily a dog is provoked by a frightening trigger – a finding that suggests that how aggressive a dog is may have little to do with genetics. The team says the study has implications for owners. “They should pay much less attention to all the stories about what their dog’s breed ancestry says about their behaviour and personality, and pay attention to the dog sitting in front of them,” said Karlsson. Daniel Mills, professor of veterinary behavioural medicine at the University of Lincoln, who was not involved in the work, said genetics can give insights into populations but often reveal far less about individuals. Mills added that it was not surprising genetics played little role in canine aggression, and criticised breed-specific legislation. “Potentially risky behaviours … are unlikely to be controlled by simple genetic mechanisms since animals have to make judgment calls based on the much wider environment and their developmental history,” he said. The findings came as another study, published in Scientific Reports, revealed that different breeds have strikingly different life expectancies. The analysis of 30,563 records of dog deaths in the UK, collected between 2016 and 2020, showed that while jack russell terriers have a life expectancy of 12.72 years at birth, flat-faced breeds tended to have shorter lives, with French bulldogs having a life expectancy at birth of just 4.53 years. Such brachycephalic dogs are known to be prone to myriad health problems as a result of their extreme physical traits. Justine Shotton, president of the British Veterinary Association, said the findings of lower life expectancy for flat-faced breeds was concerning: “While the study doesn’t prove a direct link between these breeds’ potential welfare issues and shorter length of life, the findings serve as a fresh reminder for prospective dog owners to choose a breed based on health, not looks.”",News/Science,"Dog behaviour has little to do with breed, study finds",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/28/dog-behaviour-has-little-to-do-with-breed-study-finds
4/29/2022,"Wholesale power prices in Australia’s main electricity market continued to rise in the first three months of 2022, more than doubling the cost a year earlier, with the increase blamed mostly on more costly fossil fuels and the falling reliability of coal-fired power plants. Renewable energy, meanwhile, grew its share of the market to more than one-third, pushing carbon emissions from the largest polluting sector to new lows, according to the quarterly energy dynamics report from the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo). Wholesale electricity prices averaged $87 per megawatt hour (MWh) in the first three months of 2022, up 141% from a year earlier, and two-thirds higher than the final three months of 2021. By the end of the March quarter, the average price in the four eastern mainland states was $94/MWh, up from an average of $65/MWh at the end of 2021. On Thursday, future prices for this quarter topped $200/MWh for both Queensland and New South Wales, indicating the jolt in costs is continuing. For the March quarter, generation at black coal plants in NSW and Queensland fell an average 456MW. Availability was off 3% to its lowest March quarter level since at least 2002. The unavailability of those ailing units – along with higher demand particularly during heatwaves in Queensland – triggered a divide with those states facing “significantly” higher prices than Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, Aemo said. “Coinciding with unplanned coal generation outages, Queensland experienced significant episodes of high demand, with overall price volatility contributing $47/MWh of the region’s average Q1 price of $150/MWh, its second highest for any quarter since 1998,” said Violette Mouchaileh, an Aemo executive. The leap in wholesale power prices is beginning to feed into the bills sent to households and businesses. Extra costs will also stoke the highest consumer price inflation since the introduction of the GST more than 20 years ago. The higher power prices may also feature in the federal election campaign, with Coalition leaders such as the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, repeating claims on Thursday that the government had lowered power prices while they had risen under previous Labor governments. “The government is delivering on its commitment to secure affordable and reliable energy supply and has achieved its goal of wholesale electricity prices under $70/MWh,” the government stated in its budget just last month. However, Aemo said wholesale prices were already averaging almost a quarter more than that budget figure, with market bids by coal plants leading the increase as costs for the fuel rose. “Compared to the first quarter of 2021, over 3,000MW of black coal offers shifted from lower-price bands to above $60/MWh – the largest year-on-year quarterly change since 1998,” Mouchaileh said. The shift had started before the surge in global coal prices triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she added. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gas prices also soared two-thirds from a year earlier. Prices were at near-record levels across all Aemo markets, averaging $9.93 per gigajoule, compared with an average $6.05/GJ in the March quarter of 2021. Record gas prices were set in Victoria, Brisbane and Adelaide, while Sydney posted its second-highest March quarter level. Renewable energy sources continued to grab a bigger share of the market, with both capacity and output increasing. Wind and grid-scale solar output increased 743MW to a quarterly record of 4,190MW. Small-scale solar, mostly on rooftops, added another 460MW of capacity. Total renewable share reached 33.7% of supply. With the near-zero cost of fuel for wind, solar and hydro, the expansion of those sources left 6.6% of all dispatch intervals across the national electricity market at negative or zero spot prices. While a record, it was smaller than the share of such pricing in the December half of 2021. “Southern states continued to see higher incidences [of zero or negative prices] at 16.4% for South Australia and 12.5% for Victoria, compared to only around 1% across the northern states,” the report said.

The March quarter jump in wholesale prices may have a way to run. Aemo said outlooks were influenced by the closure timing of plants in NSW and the delayed return of major units on outage including Callide C4 and Swanbank E in Queensland. Higher fuel costs were also expected, particularly in NSW where elevated prices extend into 2025. Future prices in the state rose $51/MWh in the quarter to $131/MWh, the highest among the states, and exceeding the level hit in Victoria after the Hazelwood brown coal-fired plant shut in 2017. By contrast, Queensland 2023 prices are at $108/MWh, South Australia’s $78/MWh, while Victoria’s were the lowest among the mainland states at $61/MWh. In Western Australia, operational demand rose 5.9% from March 2021. “Extended high temperatures contributed to the [WA market] recording its second-highest maximum operational demand of 3,980MW on 19 January 2022.” That was just 26MW shy of the record set in February 2016.",News/Australia news,Wholesale power prices double in a year in Australia’s main electricity market,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/wholesale-power-prices-double-in-a-year-in-australias-main-electricity-market
4/29/2022,"First-home buyers have been warned to plan carefully before taking advantage of a federal government scheme that would allow them to secure property with a 5% deposit, at a time interest rates are predicted to rise. Experts say the First Home Guarantee scheme could be appropriate for people who plan to stay in one spot for a while and are comfortable riding out a possible property value trough, but warn it could still be risky, especially in regional areas. Rising cost of living and flat wages growth should also be considerations for anyone considering the scheme, which was expanded in the federal budget to include a further 50,000 places a year and higher price caps. At the time, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said entering the market was getting harder and that raising the caps would make it easier for more people to secure a loan. “These higher price caps will help more people realise their dreams and lock in a stronger future for themselves,” he said. The scheme – which has already been used by 60,000 Australians – aims to help people get into the housing market quicker by allowing mostly first-home buyers to snag a property with a deposit of as little as 5% of its market value. But research director at financial comparison service RateCity, Sally Tindall, said the predicted cooling of the housing market and multiple RBA rate hikes could lead to problems. “If you factor that into an equation with a first-time buyer who buys at the peak with a wafer-thin deposit, that could spell danger if they can’t keep up with their mortgage repayments,” she said. “Just because the government is putting it forward as a solution to Australia’s housing affordability crisis, that doesn’t necessarily make it a good idea for you.” While she and other experts said the banks’ assessment processes before a loan is approved through the scheme should protect some people, they could not protect against every eventuality. “Life can often throw curveballs that you can’t factor into an equation like this,” Tindall said. “If first-time buyers don’t have a decent buffer to fall back on, they could end up having to have a tough conversation with their bank.” She also said that buying in a regional area could be risky if the great country relocation slowed and the property lost value, and that it might not regain as quickly as a place in the city. The scheme’s cap has been raised to $800,000 for Sydney and larger regional cities across the state, including Wollongong and Newcastle. The cap for the rest of New South Wales is set at $600,000. The limits are similar in Melbourne and larger Victorian cities at $700,000, and $500,000 for the rest of the state. The founder of data analytics firm SQM Research, Louis Christopher, said the combination of the scheme and current economic factors could see people go into negative equity very quickly. “It would severely limit your lifestyle … and it also locks you in until you’re out of negative equity because if you sell your property, you still owe the bank money,” Christopher said. “There is a reason why the banking sector and us experts strongly recommend putting down greater deposits … so one can withstand a downturn early on in your homeownership.” He said most city properties would probably recover from a minor slump but “it’s quite possible you could have a downturn that lasts for years”, and that the regional market was historically far more volatile. But not all experts were as pessimistic about the regions. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Chief economist at the University of Technology Sydney, Prof Tim Harcourt, said regional Australia was in a better position now than it was a few decades ago. “We’ve seen this great relocation during the pandemic and some of the regional growth has been quite successful,” Harcourt said. “For regional cities, the prospects are quite bullish. For very, very small country towns, sure, don’t hold on. But for places like Orange and Ballarat, the prospects are pretty nice.” Economic policy program director at the Grattan Institute, Brendan Coates, said anyone with major loans needed to be paying attention to what was going on. “The warning for everyone who’s taken out a loan – particularly for people that are highly leveraged – is that high interest rates are coming and they’re coming soon,” Coates said. “For people that either have taken out a loan or are looking to take out a loan, [they] should be budgeting on the basis that interest rates are going to be substantially higher than they are today.”",News/Australia news,Buyers warned about rushing into government’s First Home Guarantee scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/buyers-warned-about-rushing-into-governments-first-home-guarantee-scheme
4/29/2022,"My wife works for a large university in an administrative role. Over the past five years or so her responsibilities have grown and her staff team has shrunk to a point where it is clearly impossible for her to do the work required. She works ridiculous hours in an attempt to achieve the impossible – which she can’t, which makes her miserable, stressed and bad-tempered. I love her deeply and I hate to see her so unhappy, but life with someone who alternates between snappy and tearful is awful, and her absolute refusal to do anything – flag the situation she’s in, see a doctor, anything – to improve things is deeply frustrating. I did manage to persuade her to join the union but she will not ask them for any sort of help. Home life is intolerable for me and must be much worse for her. Should I do anything? What can I do? Eleanor says: Sometimes when your partner goes through a trying period, your job is to help as much as possible – including by being forgiving. Other times the fact that things are “just busy right now” is no longer something that’s foisted on them – it’s a situation they’ve chosen to remain in. Past that point, the fact that the birthday party got missed or the plans got changed last-minute stops being something we can talk about in the passive voice. Their busy-ness stops being something that’s happening to them – it starts being something they’re doing. The trouble is it’s very hard to figure out where that point is. It’s going to be different for different families; informed by what you’ve agreed on, your finances, who does the domestic work, how well expectations are managed, and what viable alternatives there are. But even though everyone has a different point of busy-toleration, you need to be able to tell your partner when you’ve gone past yours. It sounds like you’re well past yours. I’d start by making absolutely sure you’ve communicated that. Although your letter suggests you’ve talked about this together, you’d be surprised by how wide a knowledge asymmetry can sneak into a marriage. What you experience as an ever-present problem – the thing you bring up repeatedly, your highest priority for fixing – she may experience very differently. If someone asked her today how happy you are at home, what would she say? If you’re anything less than confident that she’d name the same problems you have written here, I’d start with a clear and careful conversation to fix that. These chats can be tricky, but you’re not accusing her of ruining your home life – your letter brims with regard and genuine concern. All you need to communicate is that concern plus one additional insight: there’s no reason to suppose work will get better by itself. Second, I’m curious what shape her “refusal to do anything” takes. Where you invest your energy depends on which one of these scenarios she is in. Is it that overwork has eroded her mental health? Terrible workplaces make casualties of our self-esteem and imagination, two things we need lots of to chase a better future. Or is it a point of pride to work so hard; is she proving something to a colleague, or to herself? Is there a feature of the rest of life that working so hard allows her to evade? Working with her to discover why she doesn’t want help may make it feel less invasive to try to supply it. Try not to lead with how this affects you – start with how it impacts her and the “we” of your collective life. That way you’re on her side. Meantime, it might help to start small – suggesting a phoneless walk in the morning together, or a dedicated hour once a week with no work-chat allowed; some time set aside on the weekend to take turns doing nice things for one another. Change, for anyone, comes when we see how hard things are now and realise they won’t change on their own.

4/29/2022,"Australia’s defence minister, Peter Dutton, said on Anzac Day: “The only way you can preserve peace is to prepare for war and be strong as a country, not to cower, not to be on bended knee and be weak.” But how does this rhetoric about preparing for war match reality? We take a look at five significant defence projects that are either well behind schedule or have had major problems. This is the most high-profile defence acquisition debacle. In the process, two close partners of Australia – Japan and France – have been burnt. Tony Abbott formed a close working relationship with the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and was known to be keen on Japan building Australia’s future submarine fleet. In February 2015, however, the then prime minister fought off a leadership spill motion in part by promising a “competitive evaluation process” to shore up support from South Australian colleagues worried about shipbuilding jobs in that state. Abbott’s defence minister, Kevin Andrews, said in 2015 it would be an investment “in the order of $50bn” and the next submarine “must be delivered in time to avoid a capability gap in the mid-2020s when the Collins Class submarine is scheduled to be retired from service”. In 2016, Abbott’s successor Malcolm Turnbull announced France’s DCNS – now named Naval Group – had been selected instead of Japan or Germany “as our preferred international partner for the design of the 12 Future Submarines, subject to further discussions on commercial matters”. It took years to finalise the overarching strategic agreement, and the auditor general found the Australian government had “increased the risk of this acquisition” by going for a tailored solution rather than buying submarines “off the shelf”. Fast forward to September 2021, when Scott Morrison pulled the pin on the $89bn French conventional submarines project in favour of the Aukus deal, under which Australia now seeks at least eight nuclear-propelled submarines at unspecified cost. As it stands there is no contract – the details are subject to a joint study that runs until early next year. Morrison initially said the first of the new submarines should be in the water by 2040 but Dutton has since implied the mid-2030s might be possible. This has all raised concerns about a capability gap before the new submarines are ready. The government is already planning to extend the life of the six Collins class submarines by 10 years, with extensive refitting set to cost between $3.5bn and $6bn. Labor supports Aukus but says it would consider interim options such as fitting Tomahawk missiles to the existing Collins class submarines. The government is facing growing scrutiny about its $45bn future frigates program. The Coalition wants nine Hunter class frigates, optimised for anti-submarine warfare, to replace the current Anzac class frigates. They are meant to provide the Royal Australian Navy with “the critical capability required to defend Australia well into the future”. But the project is still in the early design stage and there are concerns about risks linked to the increased weight of the Hunter class frigate. A major projects report notes the plans have “experienced schedule variance due to delays in the United Kingdom’s Type 26 program, which is the Reference Ship Design for the Hunter Class frigate”. In February, the Australian newspaper reported the Hunter class frigates could be “substantially” slower than comparable RAN surface combatants, have a shorter range than originally intended, and be vulnerable to detection by enemy vessels, based on a Defence engineering team assessment. Dutton said his department had assured him it could mitigate the risks. “Yes, concerns are raised, but they are being addressed,” he told Sky News. The defence minister said the government decided last year “we would push back the start of this [first] ship by about 18 months and the reason we did that was because of the lack of maturity around the design”. Officials say the first ship is expected to be delivered in 2031 and the final one in 2044. Ships are usually operational one to two years after delivery. A much-trumpeted $1.1bn upgrade to the Jindalee Operational Radar Network (Jorn) is running “several years” behind schedule. That is despite the announcement by the Morrison government in 2020 that it was expanding the Jorn site at Longreach in Queensland “to provide wide area surveillance of Australia’s eastern approaches and enhance Australia’s strategic situational awareness”. Jorn supports the Australian defence force’s air and maritime operations while also providing “strategic surveillance”. The upgrade includes plans to modernise the command and control system at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Edinburgh in South Australia and three radar sites at Longreach, Laverton in Western Australia and Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. According to the latest major projects report published by the Australian National Audit Office, the upgrade project has “experienced persistent lag” in delivering the systems engineering program, mainly due to underestimating how complex it would be. Those delays are “considered unrecoverable”. The upgrade was meant to be completed by January 2029 but the dates of all of the key milestones are now listed as “to be advised”. “The delays are anticipated to be several years,” the report said. This is a near-term capability that Australia won’t have for budget reasons. Officials revealed in a Senate committee hearing earlier this month the government had quietly scrapped the $1.3bn armed drones program to partly offset the cost of a cybersecurity package dubbed Redspice. Under the now-cancelled SkyGuardian program, which the Department of Defence said provided “an excellent capability system”, Australia planned to acquire up to 12 armed drones. The then defence minister Linda Reynolds hailed the merits of the project in 2019: “Cutting-edge technology of this kind, with advanced sensors and systems, would complement advanced aircraft such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and ensure that Australian defence force maintains state-of-the-art capability.” Vice Admiral David Johnston, the vice chief of the ADF, confirmed the axing of the project means “we do not have drones that are armed”, although he argued that type of capability “can be mostly replicated through other means”. The executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Peter Jennings, condemned the “mind-bogglingly stupid” decision because it was “a rare Defence project that was going to deliver new combat capability in just a few years”. Labor has will consider reinstating the program if elected. The shadow defence minister, Brendan O’Connor, told Guardian Australia he was concerned about a “very significant capability gap in the immediate future” and noted Ukraine was seeking armed drones. The acquisition of MRH90 Taipan helicopters can be put in the “long-troubled” box. Australia bought 47 Taipans as a replacement for the Black Hawk and Sea King helicopter fleets, but the multibillion-dollar Howard government-era acquisition has been listed as a “project of concern” since 2011. The helicopters are used by the army – including to provide support to special operations – while the navy also relies on them for maritime support. The entire fleet was grounded in 2019 amid serious concerns about the tail rotor blades and 27 aircraft were grounded in 2020 to fix cabin sliding door rails. In October 2020, Defence officials conceded the door was not wide enough to enable the safe exit of personnel from the helicopter while it was firing. The Australian government has now formally requested advice from the US on the acquisition of up to 40 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters for the Australian army “as an alternative platform to the MRH90 Taipan”. Essentially this signals the likely withdrawal from service of the Taipan helicopters well before the original 2037 date. In announcing the change of course in December, Dutton said the Taipans had been found to be “unreliable” and he hoped the new ones would be in service “over the next couple of years”. The new helicopters would not be built or designed in Australia, he said, because it was important to “achieve capability sooner than later”. The defence department has previously estimated the total cost of the MRH90 Taipan program would be $15bn by the time the helicopters were due to be withdrawn from service in 2037, including $3.7bn for the purchase and $11.3bn to sustain them. In a way, the helicopter plans have come full circle, now the government is pursuing Black Hawks again. The Australian National Audit Office previously found “significant implications” from the Howard government’s decision in 2004 to approve the acquisition of the MRH90 aircraft, instead of the initial defence department recommendation for Black Hawks.

4/29/2022,"Two of Labor’s star candidates in must-win marginal electorates have advocated strongly for an increase to the jobseeker payment, contradicting the party’s decision to scrap its planned review of the benefit if it wins government. The opposition dashed the hopes of welfare advocates at the beginning of the campaign after confirming it had no plans to review the unemployment payment, as it had planned to do if elected in 2019. It also explicitly said it would not raise the rate in its first budget. The decision, which puts the opposition on a unity ticket with the Coalition on income support rates, came despite Labor seeking to make cost-of-living pressures a key plank of its election campaign, and amid rising costs linked to record inflation figures. Earlier this month the shadow assistant minister for the Treasury, Andrew Leigh, said the party had no plans to review the payment, pointing to the Coalition’s decision to lift the base rate by $50-a-fortnight last year. But two of the party’s candidates in crucial marginal seats in New South Wales and South Australia have publicly called for further increases to the payment following that decision, pointing to the large gap between the payment and the poverty line. In a speech to the National Press Club last year Andrew Charlton, Anthony Albanese’s handpicked candidate to run in the western Sydney seat of Parramatta, said lifting the jobseeker rate “made good economic sense and was the right thing to do”. Charlton, an economist and former adviser to Kevin Rudd, was speaking after the Coalition ended the $550-a-fortnight coronavirus supplement in favour of a flat $50-a-fortnight increase to the payment. That was a cut to the incomes of those on benefits who had received a higher rate during the pandemic. He said it was “very hard to understand” why increasing the payment wasn’t “a big priority”. During the pandemic Charlton’s consultancy firm, Accenture, conducted analysis of the coronavirus supplement payment which found that most of the increased payment was used to pay bills, buy household goods such as groceries, and pay down debt. He told the press club the analysis showed the payment had been “life-changing” for recipients, lifting hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty. “The pandemic helped us answer the age-old question about the generosity of social payments; it taught us that giving more money to lower income people has many positive benefits both to them and to the community,” he said. “I hope that we get to the situation where we can recognise that lesson of the pandemic, take some of that data and use it to inform better, more generous and ultimately more effective welfare policies going forward.” Louise Miller-Frost, a prominent South Australian social service advocate and Labor’s candidate in the marginal Adelaide seat of Boothby, went even further, saying the jobseeker rate set by the Coalition represented “intentional cruelty against the most vulnerable, least advantaged in our community” and suggested Australia was “no longer the lucky country”. The base rate was then about $44 a day, but with recent indexation it is now $46 a day, or $642.70 a fortnight for a single person without children. “The government has made an informed and deliberate decision to put over 1 million Australian families and individuals into poverty,” the then chief executive of Vinnies SA said in a Facebook post in February 2021. “They have decided it is OK for children to go without regular meals. It is OK with the government for Australians – those they are elected to serve – to not be able to afford to pay their electricity bill, or buy the medications they need, to be at risk of homelessness, or indeed to be on the streets. Because that is what this decision means. “This guarantees that nearly 1 million adults – and their children and other dependents – will remain in poverty.” Asked if she stood by the comments, Miller-Frost told Guardian Australia she wanted to “see an increase to jobseeker”. “It is a view I have formed through my work as Chair of Anti-Poverty Week and Adelaide Zero Homelessness Project, as CEO of Vinnie’s and Catherine House,” she said. But echoing comments from the party’s frontbench, she added: “Labor won’t be able to undo nine years of damage caused by the Liberals in one budget.” Privately, the opposition’s move on jobseeker has been met with dismay among some Labor figures, while Lisa Chesters, the MP for Bendigo, has said publicly that she disagreed with the new position. Asked in the first week of the campaign if he could live on the jobseeker rate of $46 a day, the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said he knew what it was like to “live on a fixed income” given his mother was on the disability pension. “What we’ve said is we don’t have a plan to increase the jobseeker allowance in our first budget,” Albanese said. “But what you would do, and I’ve said this on a number of occasions consistently that I’ve been asked, every time governments do a budget, they should look at what is responsible and do what they can to help those in need.” But Albanese also warned that if elected, Labor would face significant government debt. Other Labor MPs who savaged the current jobseeker rate last year include Canberra MP Alicia Payne and Wills MP Peter Khalil, who said in March last year the $3.57-a-day increase to benefits was “not even enough to even buy [two] florets of broccoli from Woolies”. The Greens have pledged to increase all welfare payments to $88 a day, at a cost of $43.7bn in the first year, in what it calls a guaranteed livable income. “Teal” independent hopefuls Zoe Daniel and Kylea Tink, as well as independent incumbents Zali Steggall, Rebekha Sharkie and Andrew Wilkie have also backed an increase to welfare payments.

4/29/2022,"A group of construction unions are set to announce a green ban as part of efforts to protect the historic John Curtin Hotel in Melbourne from redevelopment. The 150-year-old venue, named after wartime Labor prime minister, John Curtin, was recently bought by an overseas-based investor and developer. Opposite Victoria’s Trades Hall in Carlton, the Curtin has long been a popular meeting place for labour movement members and union figures, including former prime minister Bob Hawke. Following Hawke’s death in 2019, the hotel hosted an unofficial wake that was attended by hundreds, including then-opposition leader Bill Shorten, the state’s premier, Daniel Andrews, and former premier Steve Bracks. More recently, it has cemented its legacy as one of Melbourne’s best live music venues, acting as an important stepping-stone for emerging local and international talent. Prior to its sale, the City of Melbourne granted the Curtin interim “significant” heritage listing, meaning the heritage value of the hotel be considered in any proposed redevelopment of the site. A seperate application for permanent protection, jointly made by Victoria’s National Trust and Trades Hall in March, is being assessed by Heritage Victoria. The Building Industry Group of unions, which represents electricians, plumbers, construction and metalworkers, is also stepping up to protect the Curtin, and will announce a green ban to prevent its demolition. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The term was coined in the early 1970s by Jack Mundey of the Builders Labourers Federation, which fought successful campaigns to protect parkland, low-income housing and buildings with historical significance in Melbourne and Sydney. The chief executive of the state branch of the National Trust, Simon Ambrose, credits green bans with saving Melbourne’s Queen Victoria Market, Regent Theatre and Flinders Street Station from development. “The National Trust is proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with the union movement to protect the Curtin, another beloved cultural institution,” he said. “The Curtin has been a community meeting place for more than 160 years. Our goal is to ensure that it remains a pub and live music venue, and doesn’t become a facade with a block of apartments behind it.” Victorian Trades Hall secretary, Luke Hilakari, said the union movement has a “long and proud history of protecting important cultural sites and buildings in Melbourne”. “This is about saving an important gathering place for the future, but it’s also about preserving our city’s heritage,” he said. He said the union wanted to avoid a repeat of the illegal demolition of Carlton’s Corkman Hotel in 2016, which resulted in its developers being fined nearly $1m and jailed after failing to turn the site into a public park. “This green ban sends a clear message from Victorian workers: we will not stand by and let our precious, historic building be destroyed.” City of Melbourne deputy lord mayor, Nicholas Reece, said heritage pubs had irreplaceable social and cultural value. “The City of Melbourne has endorsed interim ‘significant’ heritage protection for The Curtin Hotel, to help ensure it receives the strongest possible level of protection in any redevelopment application,” he said. “Any redevelopment proposal will be considered extremely carefully by councillors.”",News/Australia news,Unions to announce green ban in bid to protect Melbourne’s John Curtin hotel,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/unions-to-announce-green-ban-in-bid-to-protect-melbournes-john-curtin-hotel
4/29/2022,"The prospect of the Reserve Bank of Australia raising interest rates in May has prompted a spike in queries about fixed loans from borrowers and reinforced expectations that property prices will fall, including in Melbourne and Sydney where they may already have peaked. Traders have priced in a lift in the RBA’s cash rate to 0.25% at its 3 May meeting after Wednesday’s March quarter inflation data was much higher than forecast. Most banks, with the exception of the Commonwealth Bank, say the central bank has no choice but to raise the rate from a record-low 0.1% after consumer prices rose the most in more than 20 years. Sally Tindall, research director at RateCity.com.au, said her firm on Thursday had received “lots of inquiries about fixing and whether now’s a good time to fix on the back of [the] CPI figures”. According to the Australian bureau of statistics, the share of loans taken out with a fixed rate peaked last July at 46% and had shrunk to just above one in four by February. Tindall said it was too early to tell whether any short-term jump in fixings would last. Tindall said the big four banks were still offering variable rate loans averaging 2.14% compared with three-year fixed loans of more than 4%. “If you’re someone that’s going to stay up late all night worrying about what the RBA might or might not do, then fixing can buy you peace of mind,” she said. On the other hand, those able to make significant extra payments or who might be thinking of selling or refinancing, “might be better off on a variable rate”. Gareth Aird, a senior CBA economist, said markets typically lead the central bank in a tightening cycle, as has happened this time. Banks had been raising fixed rates since October. One factor was the end of the RBA’s term funding facility in June. It was set up to ease Covid impacts on the economy and that allowed banks to borrow at a 0.1% rate for as long as three years. “That underpinned these incredibly low, fixed rates,” Aird said. “The market is [also] pricing in significant RBA tightening, and therefore fixed rates have risen to reflect that.” For instance the National Australia Bank, the country’s third-largest home loan lender, raised fixed rates last week for the fourth time in 2022, including lifting the rate on a standard five-year loan by half a percentage point to 4.99%. Some loans, such as those for four years, have increased almost 3 percentage points in less than a year, RateCity said. Borrowers, meanwhile, had already returned to fixing loans with shorter maturations, CBA data shows. From CBA last month, showing that borrowers if fixing are doing so very much for shorter durations. May see that change a bit after the CPI spike. pic.twitter.com/IyBqEMWCZL RateCity’s Tindall said competition between lenders meant variable loans can still be obtained at sub-2% annual rates. “There are 32 lenders on our database that have at least one variable rate for owner occupiers under 2%,” she said. “They’re entitled to refinance to someone offering them a better deal and there are still some cracking variable rates out there.” Analysis by CoreLogic showed higher rates will have a varying impact across the country depending on the size of the loan. Sydney, with the most expensive median prices at more than $1.1m, would see the biggest increase in repayments. Tim Lawless, CoreLogic’s research director, said the central bank was not yet worried about the ability of most mortgage holders to absorb the repayment pain. “The RBA has recently noted in their latest financial stability review the median repayment buffer for owner occupiers with a variable mortgage rate had grown to 21 months of scheduled repayments in February 2022, up from 10 months at the start of the pandemic,” Lawless said in a report released on Thursday. “With a two-percentage point rise in interest rates, the median repayment buffer would reduce back to 19 months, which is still substantial. “With the median household well ahead of their mortgage repayments, the risk of households falling behind on their mortgage repayments is reduced.” Those on fixed rates would be insulated from the immediate rise, but face “a refinance shock” when their loan period expires, Lawless said. CoreLogic, RateCity, and CBA’s Aird all predict house prices, if they haven’t already peaked, will start to decline as interest rates rise. The RBA has said as much too, forecasting recently that a 2 percentage point rise in rates would lop an estimated 15% off real housing prices. “A larger fall of 20% could take national housing values back to similar levels as June 2017, while a smaller 10% drop would see values at levels similar to June 2021 and a 5% drop back to September 2021 levels,” CoreLogic’s Lawless said. He said in markets where housing values have been rising faster, such as Brisbane and Adelaide, a 15% decline would take housing values back to mid-2021 levels. “While in Melbourne, a 15% drop could see values at a similar level as May 2017, or in the case of Perth, back to June 2009 levels.” Aird said the extent to which house prices fall would be “heavily dictated by how quickly and how high the RBA takes the cash rate higher”. “They’ll probably end the year around about flat given they’ve been going up in the first part of the year,” he said. “Next year, we’re looking for national home prices to end the year down around 8%.”",News/Business,Interest rates are set to start rising.

4/29/2022,"Once a month Paul sends his family out of the house. With a mask on and vinegar solution in hand, he gets to work scrubbing the mould off the roof and walls of his home. It’s in his bedroom, in the kids’ bedrooms and play room, the lounge room, the kitchen. A few days after the clean, it starts to reappear and Paul spot cleans the growth until it’s time for next month’s deep clean. Mould has been an issue in his Wollongong home since he moved in with his family a year ago. “It just keeps coming back and we’re getting no help from the real estate agent or the landlord.” Reports of mould spreading in homes has soared amid the deluge of rain and flooding across Australia’s east coast. The issue hits renters hardest, with some landlords refusing to do anything about it. “We hear from a lot of reports from tenants who’ve been struggling with mould and report it to their landlords or agents, and they will suggest it’s the tenant’s fault,” said Jemima Mowbray, policy and advocacy manager at the Tenants’ Union of New South Wales. “[The tenants] are told to open a window, or clean the house more often, or do X, Y, and Z when the problem is clearly structural.” Soon after Paul moved into his home, a handyman was sent to deal with the mould, but it didn’t solve the problem. Since then, the only solution offered by the real estate agency has been to open a window. “We’re worried that if we try and push it too hard that they’ll just decide ‘we can’t be bothered dealing with these people’,” he said. “And that would be a big problem because I’m in insecure work. The market’s not great for rentals and there is no chance in hell I’ll be able to buy something.” Mowbray suggested tenants contact the civil and administrative tribunal if their landlord refused to fix the problem, but said reporting it can create a tough choice for renters. “Even though people don’t want to live in a mouldy house, they know it’s unhealthy … sometimes making a fuss about mould has to be balanced up against ‘Well, will I get kicked out for making the fuss?’” Dr Michael Taylor, an expert in building air quality at Flinders University, said the NSW Residential Tenancy Act is broad in its requirement for homes to be fit for habitation. He says this is where tenants get a lot of pushback given there isn’t any specific requirements about mould. At the end of March, the Greens state spokesperson for housing, Jenny Leong, launched a private members bill calling for increased tenant protections in the state. This included landlords of residential properties being required to ensure homes are mould-free and have adequate waterproofing. Six weeks ago, Leong put a call-out on social media asking Sydneysiders to share stories of their mould problems. “I was told by the real estate agent it’s something I need to manage and deal with myself. Fast forward to now and mould covers the ceiling, the window sills, the toilet and whatever else is damp. It is impossible to get rid of myself,” one person commented. “We ran dehumidifiers constantly and scrubbed every weekend, but it came back overnight. My partner lost his sense of smell and taste, I couldn’t sleep, my asthma was off the charts, and they just offered to paint over it,” another said. While the wet weather has exacerbated mould problems for many people, Taylor said the issue won’t go away for everyone even if winter is drier. “Mould growth isn’t always the outcome of too much moisture. There can be underlying conditions that have caused the problem that haven’t been solved.” Taylor said if moisture has gotten inside a wall cavity from a leaking roof, for example, and it’s wet internally, then it could need replacing or the mould will continue to regrow. About 10-15% of the population are sensitive to fungal spores and can experience itching, inflammation, allergies and shortness of breath, Taylor said. He added that people who are healthy and well generally don’t experience severe health problems from mould exposure, but people who are immunocompromised can experience infections. Paul said he and his wife worry about their kids’ health due to their exposure to the mould. They frequently talk about moving out. “We bounce back and forth like this isn’t safe, we can’t stay here … but we can’t afford to pay much more for a place.”",News/Australia news,‘This isn’t safe’: NSW renters fight twin battles against mould and landlords ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/this-isnt-safe-nsw-renters-fight-twin-battles-against-mould-and-landlords
4/29/2022,"The wet weather that has triggered record floods and filled dams across much of eastern Australia looks set to extend well into winter and beyond, global models indicate. While autumn is typically the most difficult period to make season-ahead predictions, conditions favouring increasing cloud formation off north-western Australia look likely, even as rain-inducing weather from the Pacific recedes. According to the Bureau of Meteorology’s latest climate driver update, the dominant La Niña pattern in the Pacific is continuing to break down. In its stead, though, are signs that a negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole – a gauge of relative sea-surface temperatures on the west and east of that ocean’s basin – will again take hold. The negative phase increases the odds of above-average winter-spring rainfall for much of Australia. For northern Australia, it also increases the chances of warmer days and nights. “While model outlooks have low accuracy at this time of year and hence some caution should be taken with IOD outlooks beyond May, there is consistency across the forecasts from all international models,” the bureau said. By next month, all five of the major models used by @BOM_au to assess convection conditions in the Indian Ocean point to the negative - or wet for us - phase starting. Damper than usual winter and beyond likely for much of Australia. pic.twitter.com/P8uFqYqi1O “Four of five international climate models surveyed by the bureau indicate the possibility of a negative IOD development in May, with all five reaching negative IOD thresholds by June,” it said. Ben Domensino, a senior meteorologist at Weatherzone, said that another negative IOD phase would make it back-to-back events, something unseen in six decades. “It looks like we’ll have two officially declared negative Indian Ocean Dipoles, which hasn’t happened at least in [bureau] records that go back to 1960,” he said. After two La Niñas in two years in the Pacific – a pattern that sees strengthening easterly winds pushing rainfall towards Australia – the landscape “is a bit more primed for flooding” than a year ago. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Sydneysiders, are among those who won’t need much convincing of the flood risk. April will end on Saturday with the city’s rain gauge receiving more than 250mm – double the monthly average. The harbour city remains on track for its wettest year in more than a century-and-a-half of records, tracking more than 100mm above the record wet year of 1950, Domensino said. The prolonged wet comes as NSW dams are still at an average of 93% full, including about 110% at one of the biggest, Burrendong. Sydney’s dams too remain at close to 99% capacity, so it won’t take much rain to spill them again. The prospect of a negative IOD also shows up in the bureau’s seasonal outlook. Domensino said the typical north-west cloudbands bring extra rainfall to central Australia and dump most of their moisture on the western side of the Great Divide, partly sparing coastal regions such as around Sydney. Near-term outlook is for a bit of rain in the east (good for western Tasmania). Outlook for winter is for above-average rainfall for pretty much the whole continent. @BOM_au pic.twitter.com/BOJcIh3LnR Whether the additional precipitation falls as rain or snow on the alpine regions during winter may hinge on the strength of another of Australia’s climate drivers, the Southern Annular Mode. A negative phase of that Southern Ocean gauge sees the typical west-to-east storm tracks shift farther north, bringing bursts of cold weather to southern Australia. During winter, that set-up usually means more snow in the alps. “The ingredients are there for a good [snow] season but it will just come down to the individual events,” Domensino said. While conditions in the Indian Ocean are tilted more strongly towards a negative IOD, the return of another La Niña event for next summer can’t be ruled out either. A triple of three La Niñas in as many years has happened three times since 1950, according to the bureau. Prediction skill remains low at this time of year. “Most of the seven international climate models surveyed by the bureau anticipate the La Niña will ease in strength over the coming months, with a return to neutral ENSO conditions (neither El Niño nor La Niña) most likely in late autumn or early winter,” the bureau said this week. “By June three models exceed the [La Niña] threshold and by July only one does.” The Pacific patterns have widespread effects, such as worsening drought during La Niña periods in the western regions of North and South America. Commodities analysts at Rabobank said this week that US drought had worsened, resulting in the worst wheat crop conditions in 16 years.",News/Australia news,Australia braces for more wet weather with above-average rainfall predicted through winter and into spring,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/australia-braces-for-more-wet-weather-with-above-average-rainfall-predicted-through-winter-and-into-spring
4/29/2022,"For the last year I’ve been going to the physio once or twice every week, a by-product of having hips and knees that tend to seize up like elastic bands that have been pulled too tight. What began as a demoralising routine of strength tests and painful needling, has recently felt triumphant: I’m completing increasingly strenuous rehab exercises – successfully completing them. I’m not only in less pain, but I’m stronger than I thought I was. “You’re the dux of rehab,” my best friend Brigid texted when I bragged about graduating to another difficulty level. I was in no position to disagree. A few weeks ago, I had a revelation that had nothing to do with my loosening limbs. One frosty morning I was waiting outside the physio, which was locked. I knocked tentatively but there was no reply. Another woman appeared next to me and I knew by her outfit – functional runners, leggings and a baggy T-shirt, essentially exactly what I was wearing – that she was waiting for the rehab class too. She crinkled her eyes in a way that made me sure she was smiling behind her mask. We both stood shivering in the early sun. “Gosh, I hope they let us in soon!” said the woman. “Same!” I said. We both laughed and shivered some more. After a moment I said, “Should I be bold and knock loudly on the door?” We both laughed again, because women aren’t taught to do anything loudly. We’re especially discouraged from doing anything that insinuates a demand, even if that’s opening a door so we can get to an appointment. “Yes!” she exclaimed. We were comrades now. We were going to dismantle the system together, one closed door at a time. If I actually am friendly, what other stories about myself could be true?I ran to the door, knocked very hard and made a show of running back to where she stood, like I was executing a devilish crime. The woman clapped and I did a small bow. Eventually a bleary-eyed physio came to the door and said “Sorry! Forgot to open it!” and let us in. The woman crinkled her eyes at me again and then went up to the exercise room. As I was walking home from the physio, I thought a lot about the woman. It wasn’t an unusual interaction or even a particularly notable one. It stuck with me because I adore people who are quick to laugh, who deliberately go out of their way to make strangers feel at ease, and who use kindness as a bubble that wraps around everyone who they’re interacting with. She was friendly. Then it struck me. Everything this woman had been doing – the smiling, the laughing, making me feel comfortable when I was doing silly things – I had been doing too. We were mirroring each other’s warmth exactly. Could it be? Was it possible that I was friendly too? We tend to tell ourselves stories about our own personalities – that we’re quick to anger, or gullible, or shy with strangers. It had never occurred to me that I was a friendly person (I have been roasted about this every time I have brought it up with friends since, don’t worry). It just wasn’t one of the stories I tell myself about myself. It’s peculiar that we think that certain elements about ourselves are set in stone, even if there’s no real evidence to suggest that these personality traits are permanent. Maybe these stories that we carry, like heavy trunks full of memories, can become outdated – or maybe they were never really true in the first place. Are you actually a showoff? Or did you just perform a particularly emotional rendition of Drops of Jupiter one Christmas when you were 10 and your dad made a snarky comment about it? Are you really moody? Or were you moody as a 15-year-old who was perpetually broken-hearted and unable to articulate how you felt? Are you really quiet? Or were you just reluctant to speak up in that one workplace, because you were terrified of the consequences? When we carry these trunks, can they be so stuffed with preconceived truths that we assume no new or contradictory stories can fit in there too? I had assumed I was always awkward and small talk-averse, and the story was so convincing that it had overridden any other possibility. If I actually am friendly, what other stories about myself could be true? Is it possible that I can also be brave? That I’m not inherently bad at giving directions? That I would actually be a calm and considered driver? (I’m not totally sure about that, but you never know.) It’s interesting to consider.

4/29/2022,"A majority of voters agree with key Labor campaign messages that Scott Morrison is “all announcement no delivery” and Labor will “put the care back into aged care”, according to new research. A poll of 1,000 voters, commissioned by the progressive think-tank the Australia Institute, shows Labor’s messages are the most effective of the campaign so far, although Coalition claims about handling of the economy also test well. As the campaign nears the halfway mark, Labor is intent on keeping the pressure on Scott Morrison, but the highest inflation in more than 20 years and the expectation of a campaign interest rate rise is increasing the salience of cost of living pressures. The nationally representative poll has a margin of error of 3% and was conducted after the Easter weekend, after Anthony Albanese’s gaffe on unemployment dominated the first week of the campaign but before Covid-19 forced the opposition leader into one week of isolation. In the poll, 53% of respondents agreed Morrison is “all announcement no delivery”, with just 31% disagreeing (net +22%). That message was potent across the political spectrum, with Labor (72%), Greens (69%), One Nation (50%) and other voters (56%) agreeing. The claim that Morrison is “there for the photo-op not for the follow-up” has been central to Labor’s attack on the prime minister since 2020, and seeks to remind voters about failures to deliver including in the wake of catastrophic bushfires. Perhaps surprisingly in an election dominated by negative messaging, the next most effective message was Labor’s on aged care. Half of respondents (50%) agreed with the claim that Labor will “put the care back into aged care” while 29% disagreed (+21%). However, this was boosted by stratospheric support among Labor voters (81% agreeing). Some 45% of respondents agreed that “cutting Medicare is in the Liberals’ DNA, strengthening and protecting it is in Labor’s” while 31% disagreed (+14%). One Nation voters narrowly disagreed with that proposition; while more “other” voters agreed with it. Key Coalition lines had net support of 8% (44% agreeing and 36% disagreeing): “the Coalition will deliver a stronger economy and a stronger future”; and “the Labor Party do not have an economic plan … and when you don’t understand the economy, and when you can’t run a campaign, that means you can’t run the country”. A similar line claiming “Labor has no plan for Australia’s economy, no plan to create jobs and no plan for cost of living relief for Australians” received less support, with just 42% agreeing and 40% disagreeing. That line resonates with Coalition voters, with 73% agreeing, and One Nation (52%). Claims the Coalition will deliver “a stronger economy and a stronger future” received majority support only from its own voters, with One Nation and other voters narrowly rejecting it. Despite Morrison’s decision to ditch a commitment to an integrity commission and internal division over the candidate for Warringah, the first week was dominated by Albanese’s failure to name the unemployment rate and official cash rate. The gaffe initially hurt Labor’s chances, although the opposition believes its effect is waning, as China’s security agreement with Solomon Islands and soaring inflation create discomfort for the Coalition in areas of their perceived traditional strengths.",News/Australia news,"Labor’s message that Morrison is ‘all announcement no delivery’ resonating with voters, poll shows",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/29/labors-message-that-morrison-is-all-announcement-no-delivery-resonating-with-voters-poll-shows
4/29/2022,"There is a moment early in the first episode of Make or Break, a new series from Apple TV+ about the World Surf League, when Tyler Wright neatly encapsulates the tension at the heart of professional surfing. “We come from a sport of, ‘aww we’re hippies’,” says the Australian surfer, a two-time WSL champion. “We’re not. We’re competitive little assholes.” Surfing has long grappled with this bipolar identity; a sport initially beloved by the counter-culture movement that grew popular, some would say too popular, on the back of booming commercial and competitive success. Make or Break, an entertaining seven-part series, is the latest attempt by the surfing elite to capitalise on its popularity. Given the show has already been renewed for a second season – before it even went to air – they will most likely succeed. It seems that no high-performance sport can flourish in the modern era without its own behind-the-scenes show on one or other of the rapidly-multiplying streaming platforms. Drive to Survive, the Netflix hit about Formula One, is perhaps the best example – now into its fourth season, the show has expanded the ranks of motorsport fans, including in the lucrative American market. Even before Drive to Survive, English football teams and US sporting franchises were experimenting with access-all-areas docu-series. The success of these shows has sparked a content gold rush. In recent months, Drive to Survive equivalents have been announced for tennis, golf and the Tour de France. Surfing is already on the wave, with this new series developed by Drive to Survive producers James Gay-Rees and Paul Martin (the former is also known for his sporting classics Senna and Maradona). Make or Break is captivating television. Professional surfing is a director’s dream – the WSL sends a small crew of male and female surfers around the world to compete at idyllic surfing locations. The editors have made liberal use of high-definition competition footage, as surfers charge heavy barrels and pull off gravity-defying aerial manoeuvres against beautiful coastal backdrops. There is eye-candy galore. But the show’s real triumph is its ability to engage surfing fans and non-fans alike with well-told stories. Make or Break gently explains and explores the complexity of professional surfing in a manner that makes it accessible for non-surfers, without alienating long-time WSL watchers. The show is unafraid to explore the gritty reality of life on tour, with heartfelt and revealing interviews. “I’m tired to be on the road – I just want to be home,” admits an emotional Filipe Toledo. Another episode charts the challenges faced by the rookies, who live a precarious existence seeking to consolidate their WSL ranking and bank balance. “It’s only once you get results on the tour that you start earning the bucks,” says one. (Professional surfing is a top-heavy sport – the big stars sign million-dollar endorsement deals, while a few bad results can spell competitive and financial doom for others). Now-retired Australian surfing icon Mick Fanning, presented as some kind of wise owl of the surfing world, adds moments of levity throughout the series. Drive to Survive has been criticised for glossing over Formula One’s shortcomings – its history of sportswashing, gender inequality and significant climate impact. Given Make or Break was produced in partnership with the WSL, it is surprising that the first season engages more fully with some of surfing’s own pitfalls. The first episode is particularly gripping, as the WSL confronts a longstanding inequality that has historically seen the women compete at Maui, while the men surfed at the more consequential and iconic Pipeline. “Surfing is sexist,” says a no-nonsense Wright. But a shark attack at Maui during last season’s event saw the women forced to finish the event at Pipeline, a famously-heavy wave. “It would be a moment in women’s surfing history ... but at the same time, farrkkk it’s Pipe,” laughs Wright while weighing up the switch (she ultimately won the event). Pipeline now permanently hosts both the men’s and women’s competition, a positive development – albeit the sport’s lingering gender inequality remains evident in Make or Break, which focuses disproportionately on the men’s competition across the series. Make or Break may well elevate surfing to new heights. The sport’s inclusion in the Olympics last year was another step towards the mainstream; Wright’s brother, Owen, won bronze for Australia. By humanising the world’s best surfers (the frequent expletives suggest unfiltered footage), and accessibly explaining the sport’s vagaries, Make or Break will attract a wider audience to the WSL, just as Drive to Survive has done for Formula One. From the WSL’s perspective, the partnership will likely prove a shrewd commercial decision. In the new sporting era, content is king. But it does leave a wider question unanswered – at what cost? What does commercial success and greater popular recognition, propelled by a new international TV series released by one of the world’s biggest technology companies, mean for the soul of surfing? Is the sport’s growing mass-appeal an unalloyed positive? Midway through Make or Break, the WSL season heads to inland California, for an event at Kelly Slater’s Surf Ranch, a wave pool. This artificial competition setting is depicted as a pure test of surfing ability. “There’s nowhere to hide,” says one observer of the format, in which surfers compete individually on identical waves, ranked against the whole field, rather than in heat-by-heat contests subject to the whims of the ocean. Left unremarked is the profound philosophical shift prompted by wave pool surfing for a sport and past-time founded on a deep, even spiritual connection to the sea. It may be too much to expect a glossy streaming series to explore such existential questions. The evolution of the sport, from its hippy roots to wave-pool competition broadcast around the globe, continues unabated. Make or Break will only give this trend greater momentum. But, at the very least, it is compelling viewing.

4/29/2022,"This June, it will be 30 years since John Major launched one of the most mocked ideas in British political history. Proposed by a man thrashing around in the economic doldrums, the traffic cones hotline was just a phone number for angry motorists to ring up and moan about roadworks. Yet something about its spectacular banality means it has passed into Westminster shorthand. Every failing government now seemingly has its cones hotline moment, where it suddenly becomes obvious that the ideas cupboard is worryingly bare. And this week’s cabinet meeting on the cost of living sounds as if it was positively bursting with such moments. Boris Johnson had reportedly asked for proposals to tackle the cost of living emergency without spending any actual public money, a question that inevitably raises some questions of its own. He is apparently interested in an old Liz Truss proposal for cutting childcare costs by allowing childminders to look after more than six children at once. Ministers have reportedly joked that if Jacob Rees-Mogg can look after his six simultaneously, surely childminders can go one better, while simultaneously delivering a high-quality early-years learning experience and having eyes in the backs of their heads. No word on whether they’ll be allowed a nanny for backup, like the Rees-Moggs. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, reportedly suggested making MOT tests biennial instead of annual, allowing those drivers who can still afford to run their cars to drive around on balding tyres for a bit longer, at an annual saving to the motorist of a whole £55 – unless, as motoring organisations swiftly pointed out, failing to pick up a small fault early just means a bigger garage bill later on. This was, someone solemnly told the Telegraph, the kind of “bread-and-butter policy that shows that the Conservatives are on your side”. Like the cones hotline, this sounds less like a policy and more like a cry for help. Four in 10 British households will be forced into fuel poverty this autumn if nothing changes, according to the big energy companies. Food banks are braced for unimaginable levels of demand, and even the ingenious money-saving expert Martin Lewis says he’s running out of ideas to help people make ends meet. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, will almost certainly have to provide more help with fuel costs before autumn, and hinted as much in a Mumsnet webchat this week. This good news was promptly buried when he also told a disabled Mumsnetter, who is already struggling financially now, that it would be “silly” to do anything sooner, before it’s clear how bad things might actually get. At the weekend, Sunak was photographed in £600 Prada trainers walking his labrador. Nobody has yet advised letting poor people eat cake, but then the local elections are still a good week away. No wonder wiser Tories are starting to worry, as Theresa May’s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell tweeted recently, that the cost of living emergency will hurt them more at the ballot box than Partygate, or even the news that an anonymous MP was caught watching porn on their phone in the chamber. It’s not that people have suddenly stopped being angry about pandemic rule-breaking – if anything, this week’s court ruling that it was unlawful to shunt hospital patients into English care homes without testing them for Covid-19 has only rubbed salt into the wounds – or come to believe that misogyny doesn’t matter. But when you’re frightened of not being able to pay the rent, there isn’t room for worrying about much else. Lisa Nandy, the shadow minister for levelling up, is said to have warned the shadow cabinet recently that Labour shouldn’t concentrate overly on Partygate at the expense of the cost of living, and it’s a fair point. This isn’t about letting Boris Johnson off the hook, but understanding what the hook is for many people, and how to hang everything else from it. People can forgive a surprising amount of bad behaviour from a government in good times, but will judge it much more harshly once they start to feel personally worse off, and that’s the context in which Labour should now try to set all the admittedly juicy scandals consuming this government. Where Labour needs to address sleaze, it should argue that all this just goes to show that Tory minds are not on the job: that they are too busy knocking back the cheese and wine to realise how bad things are getting, or too busy watching porn instead of working. It’s obviously creepy for an MP to sit pawing through this stuff in full sight of his poor female colleagues. But it’s also frankly contemptuous of the people he is there to serve, whose lives may be shaped by debates to which he seemingly isn’t paying attention. Concern about inflation now tops the list of voters’ worries, according to the pollster Ipsos Mori, as it hits its highest level in three decades. The coming fear now is a potential rise in interest rates, which means mortgage payments going up. The cost of living crisis obviously still hurts the poorest most, but it’s creeping up the income scale, reaching more of the middle earners who voted Tory in 2019. YouGov now finds Labour level pegging with the Tories on the question of who is most trusted to manage the economy, once a reliable predictor – along with perceptions of the party leader – of electoral outcomes. And while sleaze may have faded somewhat from voters’ memories by the next election, every economic forecast suggests that living standards will loom larger, especially if ministers keep responding in ways that suggest they don’t get it. At prime minister’s questions this week, Keir Starmer asked why forecast growth in Britain is so low and inflation so high compared with its competitors. It’s a reasonable question, even though Labour doesn’t yet dare articulate the full answer, which is that every country faces the unavoidable consequences of a pandemic and war in Ukraine, but only Britain has simultaneously also attempted Brexit on top. It was Johnson’s response, however, insisting that employment is rising by record amounts, that was interesting – a bit too reminiscent of “you’ve never had it so good” for comfort. What ultimately kills long-serving governments – and the Tories have, through various changes of leader, been in power now for nearly 12 years – is often not one failure, so much as the pervasive sense that the country has big problems but that the incumbents have got nothing left in the tank. If it wants to see this government out of office soon, Labour needs to start hammering home the idea that it’s not just out of touch but out of ideas, imagination and energy too.

4/29/2022,"At lunchtime on Thursday parliament was prorogued – legally for once – before the state opening and Queen’s speech on 10 May. So ended one of the lowest, most dishonest and most discreditable parliamentary sessions of modern times. It was a session marked by the first conviction for a criminal offence by a sitting prime minister, by the revelation that the chancellor of the exchequer’s wife used non-dom tax status, and by the unravelling of the Conservative party’s ethical sense as ministers attempted to save an MP’s skin after he had been found guilty of lobbying. It was also marked by the sentencing of a Labour MP to a suspended 10-week prison sentence for harassment and the conviction of a Tory MP for molestation. The session has culminated in an extraordinary week of scurrilous scandals that seem all too representative of the disreputable and amoral culture exposed by the allegations of recent days. It was revealed this week that 56 MPs – allegedly including government and shadow ministers – have been referred to the Commons authorities over issues of sexual harassment and other misconduct. On the very morning of prorogation, a Tory MP was issued with a criminal charge of failing to stop after an accident, and a former Labour minister was suspended for bullying. If ever the country was well rid of a parliamentary session then it was surely this one. Grimly, this was also a session in which parliament continued to pass authoritarian and reactionary laws up until the last minute. This week, several major bills which had been barely scrutinised in detail in the Commons and had been subjected to multiple improvements by the House of Lords were finally scrabbled into law as the upper house bowed the knee. These include the elections bill, which introduces ID checks on voters and gives the government more authority to control the previously independent Electoral Commission, a move described this week by a former lord chief justice as repugnant; then there were the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill, an authoritarian attempt to impose needless extra conditions on rights of assembly and protest, and the judicial review and courts bill, designed to curb scrutiny of the lawfulness of government actions. With some irony, this passed into law just as the high court ruled that the government’s Covid-era care home discharge policy, in which more than 12,500 people died, had been unlawful. The waves of slapdash and overmighty new laws passed in this session and hurriedly completed this week did not end there. They also include the health and care bill, where a few Conservative MPs rebelled to the end, but unavailingly, to try to stop the government’s effort to scrap the regular independent assessment of NHS staffing needs. Another that went to the wire was the nationality and borders bill, where peers have voted repeatedly to ensure that the laws on asylum seekers in the new legislation remain in line with the United Kingdom’s treaty obligations towards refugees; nevertheless, on Tuesday, Tory MPs voted to get rid of the clause and permit Britain to breach its international commitments yet again. It was a crowning disgrace on a long list of legislative shame. It may well not be the last one. There is no guarantee that the next parliamentary session will be different. The damage to public trust bleeds ever on. The legacy of Partygate has not played out yet; much more is to come. The readiness of many MPs, led by the prime minister, to ignore other rules seems undiminished. And the taste for cruel and slippery legislative innovation will increase as the government’s popularity slides further – as it so richly deserves to do, not least in next week’s local elections.",Opinion/Opinion,"The Guardian view on the parliamentary session: a low, dishonest year | Editorial",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-parliamentary-session-a-low-dishonest-year
4/29/2022,"Marine Le Pen’s far-right National Rally party has turned its attention to June’s parliamentary elections after its defeat in the presidential contest, vowing to field candidates in every constituency and claiming the electoral system is stacked against it. “We’ve been preparing for a very long time for these elections,” said the acting party president, Jordan Bardella. “It’s essential our ideas are defended in the assembly.” He said his party would take a stand on security, immigration and French identity issues in parliament, as well as taxes. “People have to vote,” he said on the CNews TV channel. “We need an opposition.” Le Pen was beaten by the centrist Emmanuel Macron in Sunday’s presidential election by 58.5% to 41.5%, but she gained a historic score for the far right, with more than 13m votes. She will run again in the parliamentary elections in June and is likely to keep her seat in the Pas-de-Calais area in northern France. Her party has in the past struggled to translate its high number of votes in the presidential election into seats in parliament. This is partly due to a two-round parliamentary voting system that does not favour small parties, as well tactical voting to keep out the far right. Abstention is also traditionally far higher in parliamentary elections than in presidential elections, which has had a negative impact on the National Rally’s results. In 2017, the year of the last parliamentary election, Le Pen won more than 10m votes in the presidential final against Macron, but weeks later her party and its associated lawmakers won only eight seats in the 577-seat parliament. The party believes its chances are better this June because last Sunday’s presidential vote showed Le Pen had expanded her support across a greater geographical area, including a strong showing in the south-east as well as the north and north-east. “We’re in a very different situation this time because we arrived first in 159 constituencies [in the presidential vote] compared to 45 in 2017,” said Gilles Pennelle, a party delegate who is expected to be a candidate in Brittany. The party has not fixed a public target of how many seats it wants to win. Several party figures have said they hope to win at least enough to form a parliamentary grouping, which would mean at least 15 seats. A National Rally parliamentary grouping, if headed by Le Pen, would give her a bigger platform and higher visibility, useful if she decides to run for a fourth time for the presidency in 2027, which is not yet clear. In recent parliamentary elections that follow the presidential vote, the party of the newly elected president has always won a majority. A poll on Monday by Harris Interactive suggested Macron would secure a ruling majority, winning 326 to 366 seats out of 577, if he manages to strike a broad centre-right alliance with smaller parties including the rightwing Les Républicains. But an Elabe poll on Wednesday found that 61% of French people wanted a parliamentary majority that was opposed to Macron. The radical leftwinger Jean-Luc Mélenchon is attempting to form an alliance of parties on the left in an attempt to gain a maximum of seats. His party, France Unbowed, currently has 17 seats in parliament.",News/World news,Marine Le Pen’s party has high hopes for French parliament elections,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/28/marine-le-pens-party-has-high-hopes-for-french-parliament-elections
