2/2/2022,"Kim Jong Un was spotted struggling to make his way down a set of stairs in a new propaganda film. Kim has had mobility issues before, and the footage comes amid speculation about his weight loss. Experts watch Kim's health closely because it is a key sign of the health of the regime. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un can be seen struggling to walk down a set of stairs in a new propaganda film celebrating the country's achievements in the last year. The film's release follows significant speculation about the young dictator's noticeable weight loss. In the 110-minute documentary film titled ""The Great Year Of Victory, 2021,"" Kim can be seen holding an umbrella and struggling to make his way down makeshift stairs at a construction site while others in his party descend normally, Reuters reported. The Telegraph posted the relevant scene on YouTube. This is not the first time that Kim, who is in his mid-30s, has demonstrated apparent mobility challenges. In the summer of 2014, he was seen limping on state TV, and later that fall, he emerged from a long absence with a walking cane, leading to speculation that he may have been in poor health. Some North Korea watchers have suggested that Kim, who smokes and drinks heavily and reportedly enjoys a fairly rich diet, has had gout, but it is difficult to know for certain. The propaganda film that came out Tuesday shows Kim riding horses and visiting various facilities while celebrating North Korea's achievements during a time of hardship, specifically the pandemic and ongoing sanctions in response to its weapons programs. But the film also unusually makes a nod to physical changes in Kim, attributing them to worry over the nation. Kim ""showed us his fatherly side by doggedly braving snow, rain and wind while taking on the fate of the nation and people like his own children,"" the narrator says, adding that ""his body completely withered away, and he showed his motherly side by greatly suffering and worrying to realize the dreams of the people."" In November 2020, South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the nation's spy agency, estimated that the North Korean leader, who is believed to be about 5 foot, 7 inches tall, weighed around 300 pounds, roughly 100 pounds heavier than when he took control over North Korea about a decade earlier. But in July 2021, about a month after North Korea watchers noticed that Kim was looking a bit lighter, it was reported that the spy agency had concluded that Kim had lost anywhere from 22 to 44 pounds, and the weight loss trend continued, with the change quite visible in photos. North Korean state media even addressed the weight loss at one point. ""Seeing respected general secretary [Kim Jong Un] looking emaciated breaks our people's heart so much,"" a Pyongyang resident said during a Korean Central Television broadcast, Reuters reported. ""Everyone is saying their tears welled up."" Changes in Kim are watched closely by expert observers around the world, as these could be indicators of his health status. Succession in the nuclear-armed state is unclear and his health says a lot about the health of the regime. If Kim were to unexpectedly die, some suspect his successor to be his sister Kim Yo-jong, but no one has been publicly named.

2/2/2022,"Combined with what we already knew, former President Trump’s statement Sunday, night leaves no doubt that his intent on Jan. 6 had been to overturn the results of the election he lost: “Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!"" You can add that statement to the copious proof of Trump’s criminal intent that the House Jan. 6 committee has already developed regarding his unconstitutional maneuvers that day. But, of course, Trump has never hidden his desire to take and keep power without any regard to the Constitution, the truth or the law. He tweeted that Pence “didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done” even as the insurrectionists stormed the Capitol, forced Congress to suspend the electoral vote count, and drove Pence and lawmakers into hiding for fear of being killed. Indeed, Trump’s statement and his incendiary speech at a rally in Texas on Saturday show that he is prepared to employ any strategy to seize the White House if he runs in 2024. As Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) tweeted on Monday, “He’d do it all again if given the chance.” Under Justice Department prosecution standards, just the publicly available evidence is sufficient to bring an indictment against Trump for the federal crime of obstructing or impeding an official proceeding — in this case, Congress’ certification of a presidential election. The guidelines for federal prosecutions specify that prosecutors “should” generally commence prosecution if two circumstances exist: first, the person’s conduct constitutes a federal offense — i.e. the prosecutor has determined that the defendant really is guilty and the prosecution is righteous; and second, the admissible evidence will “probably be sufficient” to convict. In Trump’s case, there really is no tenable conclusion other than that he urged on the demonstrators to provoke them to obstruct or impede the official congressional proceeding. Add to that the clear proof that he personally attempted to impede the proceeding by pushing Pence to illegally block the certification. In fact, it looks increasingly as if the Jan. 6 insurrection was just a culminating episode in weeks-long campaign by Trump to overturn the election. We learned Monday that Trump was involved in exploring the idea of seizing voting machines, but the Justice Department or other departments would not go along with the plan. As for the second factor, the odds are good that a Washington, D.C., jury would return a guilty verdict given the overwhelming evidence. Since the guidelines appear to be met, should the Justice Department immediately seek an indictment as the guidelines suggest? Many smart observers think so and believe Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland is being overly diffident and methodical. Garland has indicated that the department will review all possible charges and work its way up a ladder of culpability to the top. Given the outrageousness of Trump’s conduct, and the need to hold him accountable and keep him from a second shot at hijacking the Constitution, responsible voices are urging much quicker action, ideally before the midterm elections. It seems clear that if others were in Garland’s position, the department would pull the trigger right now. Perhaps there is justification for moving more quickly, with the case against Trump already sufficiently powerful. But there is a welter of other unavoidable considerations, cutting both ways; and many of them are beyond Garland’s judgment alone. The prosecution of a former president is not, and never has been, simply a question of checking the two boxes on the federal prosecution guidelines. Start here: An unsuccessful prosecution of Trump — including a hung jury — would be a disaster that would guarantee further division in a political system that Trump has already made fragile. That means that the Justice Department needs to build an airtight case, with solid witnesses, where conviction is not just probable but as close to certain as humanly possible. And conviction at trial won’t be an end point; there is certain to be an appeal, including up to the Supreme Court, now packed with three Trump appointees. Even more weighty, and probably beyond the solitary judgment of an attorney general, are the considerations of whether a prosecution is good for the country. In the Nixon case, President Ford was the right person to decide whether to pardon the former president, and though that decision provoked outrage at the time, it probably did end the “national nightmare,” as Ford explained it. In the Trump case, the need for national closure, if anything, cuts in the opposite direction — in favor of prosecution. Trump’s brazen lack of remorse — and, indeed, his assurance that he will do it again if given the chance — counsels in favor of charging him, both to hold him accountable and to deter and incapacitate him from a repeat performance. Prosecutors are supposed to be above politics. But the prosecution of a former president is unavoidably political. That means any final call to green light the prosecution will need to involve President Biden — but if the decision is not to prosecute, it won’t be for lack of evidence of criminal conduct. @harrylitman This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",Politics/Los Angeles Times Opinion,"Litman: OK, Justice Department, you have plenty of evidence to indict Trump now",https://news.yahoo.com/litman-ok-justice-department-plenty-182212040.html
2/2/2022,"Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) sued members of the North Carolina State Board of Elections on Monday, saying it does not have the authority to prevent him from running for re-election. Driving the news: North Carolina voters in January petitioned the NCSBE to disqualify Cawthorn from running because of his involvement in the rally that preceded the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. That challenge argues Cawthorn's speech at the rally, which questioned the result of the presidential election, bars him from running for office under the 14th Amendment, which bars people from holding office if they've ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion."" Details: Cawthorn in his lawsuit does not address the voters' specific allegations but denies participating in an insurrection and says running for office is a ""quintessential First Amendment activity and afforded great protection,"" and that the voters' challenge is ""unconstitutional."" The lawsuit also argues that state law allowing for challenges to be brought against candidates is unconstitutional. The NCSBE declined to comment, saying it doesn't comment on ongoing litigation. The big picture: Cawthorn has repeatedly supported conspiracy theories about who was responsible for the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. In a recent interview with the Daily Caller, the lawmaker alleged that ""some federal groups"" were involved in the attack: ""There are a lot of situations where we heard that the FBI and other agencies had prior knowledge that some of these things were going to be happening.""

2/2/2022,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Sen. Joe Manchin declared Tuesday that President Joe Biden's vast social and environment bill is “dead,” using his strongest language to date to underscore that any revival of Democrats' top domestic priorities would have to arise from fresh negotiations. The remarks by the West Virginia Democrat didn't substantively alter the stance he'd taken in December, when he said he couldn't support the legislation as written, essentially dooming it. But his latest comments illustrated the election-year challenges facing his party as it struggles to resuscitate parts of the package and win over voters weary of the two-year-old pandemic and coping with the worst inflation in decades. “What Build Back Better bill?” Manchin said Tuesday, using the legislation’s name, when reporters asked about it. “There is no, I mean, I don’t know what you’re all talking about.” Asked if he’d had any talks about it, he added, “No, no, no no. It’s dead.” Manchin has repeatedly said he remains open to talks aimed at crafting a smaller bill that could include its provisions aimed at reducing carbon emissions, creating free pre-Kindergarten programs and increasing federal health care subsidies. But he has said negotiations have yet to begin. That lack of activity, along with Biden's dismal approval rating in polls, has prompted Democratic worries that the effort could fade away. “I'm open to talk to everybody, always have been,” he said Monday. “I just want to make sure we find a balance and something we can afford, and do it and do it right.” And while he expressed support for the original bill's provisions bolstering renewable energy, he said he also wants to “use all the fossil industry in the cleanest, absolute possible versions that you can.” Manchin's state is a significant coal producer and he has added clout on the issue as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In December, Manchin's abrupt announcement of his opposition to the 10-year, roughly $2 trillion measure, which had already passed the House, snuffed out its prospects in the Senate. His party needs his vote to prevail in that chamber, where every Republican opposes the legislation but Vice President Kamala Harris can vote to break ties. Manchin, perhaps his party’s most conservative senator, has said the bill could further fuel inflation, is too expensive and finances too many programs. Other Democrats say the measure would help families handle rising costs by bolstering the federal aid they get for health care and education costs, and its expanded child care assistance would help many people return to work. They also note that the bill would largely pay for itself by raising taxes on big corporations and high-income people.",Politics/Associated Press,"Manchin, key Dem, says Build Back Better bill is 'dead'",https://news.yahoo.com/manchin-key-dem-says-build-183012585.html
2/2/2022,"An East Texas man accused of stealing nearly 200 heads of cattle is behind bars after a “lengthy investigation,” according to the Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. A Feb. 1 news release said Charles Allen Robinson Jr. was arrested by law enforcement on Jan. 27. Officials said they showed up to his home near Kilgore with a warrant but he “didn’t go easy” into custody. It took two Texas & Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association special rangers — along with Department of Public Safety troopers and deputies from the Rusk County Sheriff’s Department — to get Robinson into custody, the release said. According to officials, the crimes were committed in September and October of 2021. Robinson faces several felony charges, including three counts of theft of livestock, which officials said is related to the theft of 157 cows, 26 heifers and 13 heads of cattle in Shelby and Upshur County. Additionally, he faces a charge of issuance of bad check, evading arrest, resisting arrest, bond forfeiture and insurance fraud, the release said. Robinson’s bond was preset at $267,000. If convicted, theft of livestock “carries a penalty range of 2 to 10 years in state prison and/or $10,000 fine,” officials said. Special Ranger Larry Hand said this serves as a reminder to livestock businesses to keep good accounting records “and never accept partial payment.” Kilgore is about 120 miles east of Dallas.

2/2/2022,"Christina Hendricks is looking fitter and stronger than ever in a brand new Instagram post. In the snap, the 46-year-old Mad Men star is working a black corset. And wow, her entire bod couldn't look stronger! So how exactly does Christina stay in such amazing shape? For starters, she leaves kettlebells around the house so she’s able to use them whenever the mood strikes. Mad Men alum Christina Hendricks doesn’t spend a ton of time posting on Instagram, but she just casually slid in a pic that made jaws everywhere drop. In a new mirror selfie, the 46-year-old actress is working a gorgeous black corset that shows off her toned legs and arms as she poses with her hand on her hip. “Foundations,” she wrote simply in the caption. Naturally, people totally freaked in the comments. “Wow. Simply wow 🔥,” one wrote. “Possibly the sexiest woman on earth 🔥,” another said. “VA. VA. VOOOOOM,” chimed a particularly impressed superfan. OK, but what does Christina do to look that fit? She’s spilled a little on her approach to wellness over the years—and it’s so relatable. Christina previously told Health that she tries to get out of exercising all the time. “I come up with the silliest excuses when it's time to work out,” she said. “I'll be like, ‘Oh no! Now I have to go and find some socks.’” But Christina shared that she used to work with a trainer and sets small goals for herself and her then-husband, Geoffrey Arend. “I'll say something like ‘OK, we need to do push-ups every day,’ and at any time in the day, I can make him get down and do them, or he can tell me to do them,” she said. Christina said her ex was definitely her gym buddy. “We try to work out together because it makes it so much more fun—and it makes the time go by quickly,” she previously told Everyday Health. When she does hit the gym, Christina will do things like lifting weights while standing on a Bosu ball (it engages your core), Shape reports. She’s also into treadmill workouts to get her heart rate up. Christina has a completely genius tip for found fitness, too: She keeps kettlebell weights around her house to use whenever she has a spare moment. “I keep [them] right next to the bed, so I can run my bathwater, do a set, and then do something else, and then come back and do another set,” she told Everyday Health. Another way she squeezes fitness into her day? She’ll break out some dance moves whenever the mood strikes. “It’s an excellent way for me to exercise and not even know that I am,” Christina said. Now, where can I get that corset?
