The screenshot was from one of the Fox News host's pro-Putin monologues. After Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin retweeted a screenshot from one of Tucker Carlson's pre-invasion monologues sympathetic to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the Pentagon's press secretary said it was an accident. ""It was a fat finger mistake by one of our social media guys,"" Jon Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, told Politico's Alex Ward. ""He undid it immediately."" —Alex Ward (@alexbward) February 28, 2022 The screenshot showed Carlson arguing that Russian President Vladimir Putin had no intentions of war, instead simply seeking to ""keep his western border secure."" Carlson has since changed his tune, jettisoning his mocking of the Ukrainian government and defense of Putin for a more simple condemnation. ""He is to blame for what we're seeing tonight,"" Carlson said of the dictator in his opening monologue Thursday night. ""Again, what Russia has done is awful, but we can make it worse,"" he said later in the show. Ahead of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last week, Carlson frequently argued that Putin was being unfairly characterized by mainstream media outlets and Democratic lawmakers. —Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) February 23, 2022 ""Since the day that Donald Trump became president, Democrats in Washington have told you you have a patriotic duty to hate Vladimir Putin,"" Carlson said on his show February 22. Carlson was highly dismissive of the likelihood of an invasion. In the same monologue, he mockingly asked whether Putin is the real enemy compared to China, drug cartels, and American teachers. ""What is this really about?"" Carlson said. ""Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? ""Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?"" he continued. ""Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs?""

3/1/2022,"Former President Donald Trump, who has a long history of denigrating the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) and who, as president, discussed removing the U.S. from the alliance, has now claimed credit for its existence. He’s also patting himself on the back for supplying Ukraine with weapons, despite once threatening to withhold security assistance from the country unless it helped smear Joe Biden ahead of the 2020 election. “I hope everyone is able to remember that it was me, as President of the United States, that got delinquent NATO members to start paying their dues, which amounted to hundreds of billions of dollars,” Trump wrote in a statement released Monday. “There would be no NATO if I didn’t act strongly and swiftly.” More from Rolling Stone Joe Rogan Posts -- and Deletes -- Fake Report About Steven Seagal Joining Russian Special Forces OnlyFans Says It Has Restored Russian Creators' Accounts Dee Snider Endorses Ukrainians' Use of 'We're Not Gonna Take It': '#FUCKRUSSIA' NEW!

Let History so note!” Trump added, conveniently ignoring that he was impeached for withholding $400 million worth of congressionally approved military aid from the nation in an attempt to extort President Volodymyr Zelensky into manufacturing dirt on Biden and his family. The statement is yet another attempt by Trump to rewrite “History” by painting himself as NATO’s greatest ally. In one of the former president’s books, The America We Deserve, which was published in 2000, he claimed that money the U.S. sent to NATO was wasted. “America has no vital interest in choosing between warring factions whose animosities go back centuries in Eastern Europe,” he wrote, according to The Daily Beast. “Their conflicts are not worth American lives. Pulling back from Europe would save this country millions of dollars annually. The cost of stationing NATO troops in Europe is enormous. And these are clearly funds that can be put to better use.” Trump’s acrimony toward NATO continued into his presidential campaign and throughout his administration. In a 2016 interview with The New York Times, Trump described NATO as “obsolete” and “unfair, economically, to … the United States.” As president, Trump berated other NATO nations for not meeting certain fundraising benchmarks and toyed with the idea of leaving the alliance. According to the Times, Trump in 2018 “told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of the military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States.” Reacting to the news Trump wanted to withdraw from NATO, Michèle A. Flournoy, who served as under secretary of defense under former President Barack Obama, told the Times that to do so “would be one of the most damaging things that any president could do to U.S. interests.” While he is now trying to portray himself as Ukraine’s savior and on Saturday called Russia’s attack “appalling,” Trump only days before praised Putin for the invasion, saying on a podcast, “Putin declared a big portion of … Ukraine … as independent.

3/1/2022,"
 Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin forcefully pushed back on comments made on the network Sunday night by retired Army Col. Douglas Macgregor, an ex-Pentagon official in the Trump administration, suggesting the West should not involve itself in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. ""This is not the liberal democracy, the shining example that everyone says it is,"" Macgregor said of Ukraine Sunday evening while appearing on Fox. ""I think we need to stay out of it. The American people think we should stay out of it, the Europeans think we should stay out of it. And we should stop shipping weapons and encouraging Ukrainians to die in what is a hopeless endeavor."" When pressed on if he believes Russia should not be sanctioned and should be allowed to invade and annex Ukraine, Macgregor said, ""Yes, absolutely."" ""I see no reasons why we should fight with the Russians over something that they have been talking about for years, we simply chose to ignore it,"" he said. ""We will not send our forces to fight, but we are urging Ukrainians to die pointlessly in a fight they can't win. We're going to create a far greater humanitarian crisis than anything you've ever seen if it doesn't stop."" Griffin, a veteran correspondent who has covered defense and diplomatic issues for years, shot down Macgregor's assertion when she appeared on the same program minutes later. ""There were so many distortions in what he just said,"" Griffin said. ""To blame NATO membership for what we've seen Putin unleash and what we've seen from Putin himself he is talking in Tsarist words ... what he just said was so distorted that I do feel that our audience needs to know the truth."" Sunday's rebuttal was not the first Griffin has leveled against statements made on her own network about the developing crisis in Eastern Europe. On Thursday, The Washington Post noted that Griffin, during an appearance on ""The Faulkner Focus,"" shot back at host Harris Faulkner for attacking President Biden over his handling of the crisis, saying, ""We've had general after general tell us that the sanctions were not going to work because they were already baked into the cake and assets already put into place. So when you say, 'We saw this coming. They saw this coming,' I'm just wondering why that was still the only strategy deployed."" Fox News's top-rated host, Tucker Carlson, for example, has received steady criticism for his opining about Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war he has waged on Ukraine, suggesting the United States has little to gain from involving itself in the crisis overseas. ""If she reports something on air, it's because she's done hard work off-camera to determine the facts of the matter and present what's true,"" Stephen Hayes, a former Fox contributor who now works at another network, told the Post. ""I suspect she has little patience with Biden-focused conspiracies or commentary that pretends these challenges started in January 2021."" Griffin said during a recent interview on ""MediaBuzz,"" another Fox program, fact-checking statements made even on her own network are an essential part of her job function. ""My role is no different than it's been since I joined Fox in 1996 in Moscow,"" she said. ""I cover the news. I've been part of the news division since those beginning days. I'm here to fact-check facts because I report on facts. And my job is to try and figure out the truth as best as I know it. I share those facts internally, so that our network can be more accurate. That's what I've always done. There's nothing different than what I've been doing for the last 20 years working at Fox.""",Politics/The Hill,Fox reporter admonishes former Trump adviser suggesting US 'stay out of' Ukraine-Russia conflict,https://news.yahoo.com/fox-reporter-admonishes-former-trump-161934671.html

3/1/2022,"As everyday Ukrainian people take up arms against Russian invaders in a desperate bid to hang onto their democracy, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) on Sunday compared their situation to protesting truckers in Canada who didn’t want to get the COVID-19 vaccine. “I pray for Ukraine and I wish them the best. They have a great president right now who has really said clearly, ‘Live free or die.’ He said, ‘I don’t need a ride, give me ammunition. The fight is right here,’” Boebert said in an interview with Fox News personalities Kayleigh McEnany and Pete Hegseth at the Conservative Political Action Conference that aired on the Fox Nation streaming service. “But we also have neighbors to the north who need freedom and need to be liberated and we need that right here at home as well.” The gun-obsessed, extremist lawmaker had been referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s refusal of a U.S. offer to be evacuated from Kyiv, as Russian troops continued to press into the capital in an unprovoked attack that has shocked the world. Zelenskyy has vowed to defend the country with its citizens, saying, “We are not putting down arms.” The city’s residents have sheltered in underground bunkers and subway stations and accepted weapons from the government to join the fight in the streets as Russian airstrikes rain down on the capital and other cities. Boebert made the outrageous comments after Hegseth brought up Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and called him an “autocrat” because he quashed anti-vaccine protests that had paralyzed international supply chains for weeks. The demonstrators were against vaccine mandates and an assortment of other measures intended to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Boebert claimed President Joe Biden is “jealous” of the control that “tyrant Trudeau” has, adding that the Ukraine crisis is “all because of weakness in America.” She did not mention the actual cause of the Ukraine crisis, Russia’s authoritarian president, Vladimir Putin. Boebert is notorious for making hateful, bigoted and false statements with potentially dangerous repercussions. On Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before a violent mob of Donald Trump supporters broke into the U.S. Capitol to try and overturn a democratic election, she tweeted, “Today is 1776.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/1/2022,"BRUSSELS (AP) — Within days, Russian President Vladimir Putin has achieved what remained out of the grasp of the European Union for many decades — to jointly buy and send weapons to a war zone — and restored something that was broken for years — trans-Atlantic unity. For years, Putin could sit back and relish in unseemly scenes of Western disunity — ranging from the Britain's Brexit move out of the EU in 2016, Hungary's long-standing antipathy towards its EU headquarters and, equally, the rift created by former President Donald Trump that has far from fully healed under Joe Biden. For Putin, the timing seemed perfect for his invasion of Ukraine since it had the potential of opening the cracks of division even further, with a war on the continent forcing everyone far outside their diplomatic comfort zone. “And just as Vladimir Putin thought that he would destroy European unity, exactly the opposite thing has happened,” European Council President Charles Michel said in an interview with a small group of reporters on Monday. “Cooperation is solid as a rock,” he said. “This is demanded by the circumstances of history. Demanded by circumstances that none of us could have imagined,” Michel added. On Monday, Biden was leading another videoconference with EU, Britain and other Western leaders to solidify a common package of sanctions that are unprecedented in scope and unity. Over the weekend, Brussels and Washington announced financial sanctions within minutes of each other, all targeting the central bank and cutting Russia out of much of the SWIFT international financial transaction system. Together they closed their airspace to Russian planes, agreed on lists of Russian oligarchs to hit. Seeing the West gel together instead of break apart, Putin on Monday went to the old lingo that the West loved to use itself in the Cold War days of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. Centering his wrath on Washington, he described Western allies as U.S. “satellites which humbly fawn on it, kowtow to it, copy its conduct and joyfully accept the rules it offers to follow.” “So it’s fair to say that the entire Western bloc formed by the U.S. to its liking represents an empire of lies,” Putin said. Western powers will take such unity as a compliment these days, and it was unheard of before Putin started massing troops on Ukraine's border. Especially, the stance within the 27-nation EU is a sea change that was achieved within a few ebbs and flows. “This is a watershed moment,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in the wake of Sunday's decision for the EU “to finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack.” This is the same European Union based on a post-World War II peace project that would only turn swords into plowshares to recreate a welfare continent of unprecedented riches. It was that same European Union that received the Nobel Peace Prize 10 years ago for what it could achieve without the use of weapons. It was also the same bloc that for years has vaunted the value of what it calls soft power — diplomacy, aid, cultural exchanges — instead of the raw power that comes through the barrel of a gun. All this change in barely a week. Now, Michel says: “There is no space for weakness and we need to show a firmness.” Nowhere has the change been more pronounced than in Germany, the EU’s leading economic power but also a country that has been reluctant to invest heavily in military power, in large part because of its militaristic past which resulted in the horror of World War II. Germany has faced persistent criticism over recent years for failing to meet a NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense. On Sunday, though, Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that Germany would commit 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special fund for its armed forces and raise defense spending above 2% “from now on, year for year.” Scholz also has done an about-face on Germany’s refusal to export weapons to conflict zones, pledging to send anti-tank weapons and surface-to-air missiles to Ukraine. “If our world is different, then our policy must be different as well,” Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said. The policy U-turn was executed by a government led by center-left Social Democrats sometimes criticized as being soft on Russia and a Green party that has a pacifist heritage That world changed as well for Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban — often seen as the EU's version of an autocrat leader much like Putin is. For years, he has been railing against the EU as meddlesome, was friends with Putin and was seen as someone who could break the bloc from within. Especially since EU sanctions against Russia require unanimity among all 27, the moment beckoned. Still Hungary, fell in line as much as the others when it came to sanctions — within days. “I spoke immediately with Viktor Orban when we faced this new situation and I can tell you, it was less difficult than expected to have the support of Hungary,"" Michel said. It might still be early days in the war though and tougher moments might lie ahead with even bigger decisions to make, especially since Putin and his circle have had time for many years to prepare for any eventuality. “They do have the ability to keep going for some time despite the pain,” said Amanda Paul of the European Policy Center think tank. “So it means that the West will need to be very committed and very determined to keep pushing and pushing.” ___ Geir Moulson in Berlin, and Lorne Cook and Mark Carlson in Brussels, contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,One Putin move and behold: West's unity tightens overnight,https://news.yahoo.com/one-putin-move-behold-wests-160434607.html
