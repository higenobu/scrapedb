1/20/2022,"The Australian has legal system confirmed why it had rejected Novak Djokovic’s appeal against deportation on Sunday. In essence, chief justice Allsop ruled that it was reasonable to consider Djokovic an anti-vaxxer. “Mr Djokovic had for over a year chosen not to be vaccinated since vaccines became available,” Allsop pointed out. “It was plainly open to the Minister to infer that Mr Djokovic had chosen not to be vaccinated because he was opposed to vaccination.” Allsop’s explanation runs to 31 pages and more than 11,000 words, which may explain why it has taken four days to be published. Civil rights campaigners immediately expressed concern at the implications of the verdict - namely, that someone who held lawful yet controversial views could be deported for being a theoretical risk to “good order”. In fact, it seems likely that the Djokovic case will be used as a legal precedent in future, reinforcing the Australian government’s power to expel those they deem undesirable from the country. One chilling sentence in Allsop’s verdict pointed out that, “There was no requirement upon the minister to afford Mr Djokovic natural justice.” As soon as immigration minister Alex Hawke announced the cancellation of Djokovic’s visa for a second time, Djokovic’s legal team had always faced a daunting challenge. Earlier in the process, they had won an eight-day stay of execution on procedural grounds. On January 10, a judge agreed that Djokovic should have had more time to consult his lawyers before the Australian Border Force cancelled his visa and drove him from Melbourne’s Tullamarine Airport to the infamous Park Hotel. The hearing on Jan 16 was more awkward. According to local laws, government lawyer Stephen Lloyd QC didn’t have to show that Hawke was right, but simply that he had considered the arguments in a rational manner. Allsop had little difficulty in reaching this conclusion. He wrote: “Even if Mr Djokovic did not win the Australian Open, the capacity of his presence in Australia playing tennis to encourage those who would emulate or wish to be like him is a rational foundation for the view that he might foster anti-vaccination sentiment.” Djokovic’s defence focused on the fact that he is not a true anti-vaxxer - in that he has never gone out of his way to call for others to reject vaccination - while also pointing out that his ejection from the country might do more to inflame anti-vaxx sentiment than his presence at the Australian Open. But Allsop ruled that it was enough for Djokovic to be perceived as a figurehead. “An iconic world tennis star may influence people of all ages, but perhaps especially the young and the impressionable, to emulate him. This is not fanciful; it does not need evidence. It is the recognition of human behaviour from a modest familiarity with human experience.” As for what Djokovic’s lawyers called the “counter-factual” argument, we will never know what would have happened if he had remained in Australia. But the predicted outrage at his deportation has failed to materialise, and there have been no concerted protests at the Australian Open thus far. The fall-out around the case continues, however. Also on Thursday, Tennis Australia denied claims in local media that it had agreed to cover Djokovic’s legal costs over the affair, while other reports suggest that Djokovic is considering suing the Australian government for £3.2 million.",World/The Telegraph,Australian chief justice reveals why he rejected Novak Djokovic appeal against deportation,https://news.yahoo.com/australian-chief-justice-reveals-why-071730354.html
1/20/2022,"ROME (AP) — A top leader of the Knights of Malta, an ancient aristocratic Catholic order that provides humanitarian aid around the world, warned the group’s members on Wednesday that the Holy See’s latest proposals to reform the order threaten its internationally recognized status as a sovereign state. The Knights’ grand chancellor, Albrecht von Boeselager, wrote a letter to the Knights’ members saying the Vatican proposals contradict assurances he had been given that Pope Francis doesn’t want to put the order’s sovereignty at risk. That sovereign status allows the Knights to have diplomatic relations with more than 100 countries, which facilitates the delivery of humanitarian aid in war zones and conflict areas, and participate in the U.N. and other international organizations as an observer state. Von Boeselager, who acts as the order’s prime minister and foreign minister, said he would normally raise his objections directly with the Holy See, from one sovereign state to another. “But that avenue has been closed to me,” he wrote in the letter obtained by The Associated Press, suggesting he had essentially been cut off from direct contact with the Vatican. The Knights of Malta is an ancient chivalric order that runs hospitals and clinics around the world. It counts 13,500 knights, dames and chaplains, 80,000 permanent volunteers and 42,000 employees, most of them medical personnel who lend first aid in areas of natural disasters and conflict zones. The order experienced a governance crisis in 2016-2017 sparked by a condom distribution scandal that resulted in Francis ousting the then-grand master and imposing years of Vatican-mandated reforms. Francis in 2020 appointed his latest envoy to oversee those reforms, Cardinal Silvano Tomasi, and last year gave Tomasi sweeping powers to override the Knights’ existing constitution and governance structures to push the changes through. According to Tomasi’s latest draft of the proposed new constitution, the Knights would be a “subject of the Holy See,” not a sovereign entity, according to people familiar with the draft. Von Boeselager complained that Tomasi’s draft proposals “constitute a hazard to its long-held sovereignty.” Saying he could not accept the changes in good conscience, von Boeselager announced he was relinquishing his role in the reform process and that two delegates would represent the order at a meeting next week that Tomasi has called to discuss the draft.",World/Associated Press,Knights of Malta warn Vatican reforms risk their sovereignty,https://news.yahoo.com/knights-malta-warn-vatican-reforms-152057917.html
