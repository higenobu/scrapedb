4/26/2022,"At 3:15 at the MCG on Monday, the only sounds were a bawling baby and the Australian, Aboriginal and New Zealand flags flapping at half-mast. As a fan, it’s the one minute where the AFL and its sponsors aren’t trying to flog you something. For the Essendon players, it was a momentary respite from what had been a noisy week. Former players, ex Collingwood coaches, fans, pundits, panellists, professional fault finders – they were climbing out of trees to bag them. The Bombers were too soft. They were too nice. They had no depth. They had no grunt. They had no backline. They had no brand. They had no business playing on Anzac Day. Some of it was warranted. Some of it was plain ridiculous. One newspaper headline read “AFL’s disgraceful acts exposed”. I was half expecting a story about a glassing in a bar. But no, it was David King lamenting Essendon’s lack of midfield pressure. Kane Cornes took exception (you can set your watch to those four words) to the way they laughed with their opponents last Sunday. Mick Malthouse, fresh from tipping them to win the premiership, said they were “pathetic”. In an emotional and historically questionable speech to his former club, he said there was nowhere to hide on Anzac Day. “It’s either victory, or disgrace,” he said. While Old Chuckles was reliving first world war cavalry charges, Essendon had eight days to figure out how to defend as a team, how to apply a modicum of pressure and how to work the locks to a talented Collingwood side. As they lined up to pay their respects however, their problems were on full display. They lacked big, mature bodies. Hooker had retired. Hurley was hobbled. McDonald- Tipungwuti, who kicked five goals in this game last year, was in the reserves. Stringer and Merrett were rushed back in. But many of their teammates looked very slight and very raw. Eight were playing their first Anzac Day match. To their credit, the Bombers responded. They looked like a completely different outfit to the one that barely gave a yelp against the Dockers. They tackled. They harassed. They shed their bruise-free tag. Their ruckman, who looks like something out of Beyond Thunderdome, threw his weight around. Darcy Parish had an astonishing 30 first half possessions, something no footballer has managed this century. But they lacked polish. They couldn’t convert. In the second term in particular, they squandered some easy chances in front of goal. Collingwood, on the other hand, were kicking goals out of their backsides. They had kicked themselves out of the West Coast and Geelong games, but were dead-eyes yesterday. Jack Ginnivan and Brodie Mihocek booted nine goals straight between them. Ginnivan won the medal, but in many ways Scott Pendlebury was the architect. With the game in the balance in the third term, he shifted into the middle and had an immediate impact. He has now had more than 9,000 possessions as a league footballer, and yesterday moved past Gary Ablett Jnr into fourth spot on the all-time list of accumulators. Of those 9,000 touches, you could count the errors on one hand. For possibly the first time in his career, he was run down from behind. As imperturbable as ever, he then helped set up the next three goals. But the story in many ways was Essendon. A lot is expected of them. Their supporters certainly demand a lot. Off-field, they talk a big game. They want to be a powerful club again. “We exist to win premierships,” their chief executive said late last year. Don’t we all, fella. You can release a mission statement every week if you want, but it doesn’t mean a bag of beans if you can’t get your best players on the park, and if the ones who do play are reluctant to defend and tackle. For too long now, they have been a team that only has one plan, one gear, one mode. They’ve been great to watch, but easy to counter. The coach wants them to be a blue-collar side, but for the first five rounds they were anything but. Malthouse reckons that whoever loses on Anzac Day knows nothing but disgrace. But the only disgrace was Mick’s martial metaphors. On Monday, the Bombers were finally willing to get their hands dirty. On Monday, they showed enough to suggest that 2022 is not a complete write-off. The coach insists that they’re still a work in progress, that they’re still figuring out what sort of side they are, and that the football world was perhaps too easily seduced by them last year. He urged patience. After last week’s pile on, the football world may actually take him up on that. For a supporter base that has endured a supplements scandal and years of treading water, it’ll be a slightly harder sell.",Sport/Sport,Essendon bring heat in AFL Anzac Day clash but still lack polish | Jonathan Horn,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/26/essendon-bring-heat-in-afls-anzac-day-clash-but-still-lack-polish
4/26/2022,"‘Let’s make a thriller out of this movie,” suggests Alexei Navalny to his director, Daniel Roher. “And then, if I am killed, you can make a boring movie of memory.” It’s typical of the man: for someone in a situation of such precarity, Navalny seemingly struggles to take anything too seriously. It’s clearly a defence mechanism – and in the circumstances, who can blame him? The alternative might involve surrendering to despair, and that would help no one. And anyway, Navalny has been living on the edge for long enough to be used to it. This startling, terrifying documentary (BBC Two) offers up a potted history of Navalny’s anti-Putin, pro-democracy activism. At times, he seems like a one-man opposition: equal parts politician, provocateur and investigative journalist. He’s not ideologically bound – in fact, there’s an interesting segment where Roher probes his brief, pragmatic-going-on-troubling alliance of convenience with the far right. But mainly, he’s portrayed in the mainstream Russian media as that most dreaded of things: a liberal. Navalny is very much a figure of his era. He namechecked The Wire and enjoyed social media discourse with its creator, David Simon. Much of his most successful work has involved exploiting social media and mobile filming technology, which is partly why his name has spread so far beyond Russia. For Navalny, social media is a weapon and a shield. When, for example, he and his wife, Yulia, board the plane that is returning them to Moscow, he is relieved rather than irritated to be greeted by a forest of filming phones. When you oppose a regime that shrouds its deeds in darkness, there cannot be too much light. But did Navalny overestimate the protection his fame – and people’s fascination with him – was offering? “As I became more famous, I was sure my life was becoming safer. Because it would become problematic for them to kill me.” He pauses for a moment before remarking wryly: “I was very wrong.” Yes he was. Navalny’s 2020 near-death experience occasioned by Russia’s signature nerve agent novichok is the heart of this film. While recovering in Germany, he joins forces with Bellingcat investigative journalist Christo Grozev (“a nice Bulgarian nerd with a laptop”) in an attempt to dig out the facts about his poisoning. What ensues is remarkable – the point at which Navalny enters the realms of the entertaining but far-fetched espionage thriller. With a surprising degree of ease, Grozev and Navalny’s small team uncover the identities of the Federal Security Service (FSB) agents sent to kill him. They even get their phone numbers. And then, Navalny rings them, one by one, to ask why they did it. At first, it doesn’t go well, mainly because Navalny can’t resist saying who he is. The agents simply hang up. Eventually, though, he poses as a Kremlin investigator, looking to explore the reasons for the mission’s failure. Soon enough, one of his would-be assassins is singing like a canary. The ensuing conversation is one of the most jaw-dropping things you’ll ever witness – it’s clearly all in a day’s work for the agent who, as Navalny fights to keep the incredulous glee out of his voice, drones on about dosage, the exact placement of the poison in Navalny’s underpants and the annoyingly quick reactions of the emergency services. “Poor guy,” smirks Navalny at the end of the conversation. “They will kill him.” Navalny’s resistance cell has a small, charmingly ad hoc air about it. But the film brilliantly captures the innate foolishness of his opponents, too – the absurdity as well as the darkness. There is always, in the end, something innately laughable about autocracies – probably because the distortions necessary to sustain their poisonous fictions can eventually only play out as either horror or comedy. At one point, a Kremlin-endorsed talkshow posits liberals’ “endless homosexuality” as an explanation for Navalny’s weakness and near-death. Vladimir Putin goes to ridiculous lengths to avoid even saying Navalny’s name, which, believe it or not, doesn’t cut the mustard as a public power-play. His persona couldn’t seem more of a contrast to Navalny’s robustness – the impression of Putin is overwhelmingly one of fragility and paranoia. In fact, Navalny’s sturdiness is such that it’s faintly surprising when events play out as we know they must. Navalny seems the moral winner throughout. His calm confidence is infectious. But he’s still in prison, facing up to 20 years. Sometimes, sadly, realpolitik trumps narrative justice. The film ends in a darkness that is all the more pronounced for our knowledge of where Putin is about to take Russia and the world. In the end, if this story is a thriller rather than Navalny’s “boring movie of memory”, it will need another chapter to reveal its happy ending. Navalny is available now on BBC iPlayer in the UK and CNN+ in the US. It will be on HBO Max in the US from 26 May. An Australian airdate has yet to be announced.",Arts/Television & radio,Navalny review – one of the most jaw-dropping things you’ll ever witness,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/25/navalny-review-one-of-the-most-jaw-dropping-things-youll-ever-witness
4/26/2022,"Cabinet ministers have been ordered to come up with new “non-fiscal” ways to combat the cost of living, in a tacit acknowledgment that the government’s spring statement failed to match the enormity of the crisis. Boris Johnson said the government would renew efforts to promote schemes with low take-up, including tax-free childcare of about £2,000 a year that about 1.3m households are yet to claim. About 850,000 eligible households are also not claiming pension credit, which can be worth over £3,300 a year. But Labour said the government needed to go further and that it was now time for an emergency budget to announce new help for struggling families. In a new analysis, the party found that families will fork out an extra £10bn on petrol, compared with just this time last year. Labour’s shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, said: “This is a savage extra cost for working people. The Conservative government needs to set out an emergency budget to tackle its cost of living crisis – and support Labour’s call to put money back in the pockets of working people.” The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been firm with departments that there is limited possibility of major further spending. Almost 90% of British households reported an increase in their cost of living last month as they were hit by escalating fuel, food and borrowing costs, according to the Office for National Statistics. It said a quarter of all those in its survey were struggling to pay their bills and 17% had turned to loans or borrowing on credit cards to make ends meet. Sunak, who announced a 5p fuel duty cut as well as raising the limit on the national insurance payment threshold, admitted at his statement last month that households would face the biggest cut in their living standards since the 1950s. The government, which pressed ahead with a national insurance rise to tackle the NHS backlog, has been urged to go further particularly in helping with the cost of energy bills, beyond the £150 council tax rebate. A new targeted communications campaign will highlight areas where people can claim support and Johnson will tell cabinet ministers that he expects a crackdown on private companies profiteering from the crisis. This comes as the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, wrote to Ofgem to urgently look into claims that energy suppliers may be making unjustified increases to consumers’ direct debits. Ahead of cabinet, the prime minister said: “With household bills and living costs rising in the face of global challenges, easing the burden on the British people and growing our economy must be a team effort across Cabinet. “We have a strong package of financial support on offer, worth £22bn, and it’s up to all of us to make sure that help is reaching the hardest-hit and hard-working families across the country. “We will continue to do all we can to support people without letting government spending and debt spiral, whilst continuing to help Brits to find good jobs and earn more, no matter where they live.” Labour has said it would enact five measures now to ease the burden on household budgets. They include a windfall tax on oil and gas producers to cut home energy bills, including a VAT cut. The party said it would give small and mid-size enterprises a business rates discount with a tax on online giants; scrap the national insurance hike; fund a major upgrade of household insulation; and instruct the National Crime Agency to investigate £11.8bn of Covid fraud and error.",News/Business,Ministers ordered to find new ‘non-fiscal’ ways to combat cost of living,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/25/ministers-ordered-to-find-new-non-fiscal-ways-to-combat-cost-of-living
4/26/2022,"If Piers Morgan were a nightclub bouncer, he would try to start fights. Before the launch of his latest broadcasting career – on Rupert Murdoch’s Talk TV, a screen-led sibling to the tycoon’s Talk Radio and Times Radio – he Twitter-challenged the Guardian to come and take him on if we were stereotypical enough. “The only way the PR campaign for @PiersUncensored could possibly get any better,” Morgan taunted, “is if the @guardian review it and says it’s terrible, unwatchable & the end of civilisation as we know it. Don’t let me down you whiny woke wastrels!” OK then, you preening pugilistic publicist, let’s see what we can do. Startlingly, even for such an established egotist, Morgan started by comparing himself to one of the greatest figures of the 20th century, winner of the Nobel peace prize and the US presidential medal of freedom. “As Nelson Mandela might have said, it’s been a long walk to freedom of speech!” Morgan opened the show, a higher voice than usual suggesting nerves that would have been touching in someone of less industrial self-confidence. Morgan was also cocky about the likely audience: “If [Putin] is watching … and he will be!” A long opening monologue promised the Piers show to herald a TV “no cancel zone” that will be an “island of sanity” in “a world gone mad.” So totalitarian are the “fun police” that someone, like Morgan, who dares to tell the truth has multiple newspaper columns and a new TV station built around him. This splenetic soliloquy also showcased the weakest part of his broadcasting persona: the Jeremy Clarkson tribute act revealed when he is allowed to speak uninterrupted for too long. But, as extensively reported (and not just by himself), Morgan’s debut coup was an interview with Donald Trump, whom the host characteristically introduced as “the most famous and divisive man in the world, present company excepted!” Recorded at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, this fight for the World Heavyweight Orange-Skinned Narcissist title brought publicity and clicks for Talk TV, but lacked news value due to Trump’s current status as an amateur golfer in Florida. As a result, this is the second successive media launch – after Andrew Marr’s move to LBC last month – that would clearly have hoped to kick off by interviewing the prime minister (whether Boris Johnson or a successor). However, the oddity of 10 Downing Street being occupied by a politician who rarely submits to questioning and, if then, by the police meant that Marr opened with Michael Gove and Morgan with Trump. The host has also boasted of his closeness to Joe Biden but, for different reasons of what might come out of his mouth, the president is no more likely to give a long-form interview than Johnson is. Admittedly, Trump is the first defeated White House incumbent since Grover Cleveland in 1888 who might plausibly seek a second term (Cleveland did, and won). The strongest news line Morgan got was a very heavy hint that Trump will have another go, although he might have glossed for viewers that the politician’s refusal to declare at this stage relates, as he hinted, to campaign finance scrutiny that begins on day one of an official race. But then Morgan, not for the first time, seemed more interested in his own contributions than his guest’s: the chat was irritatingly cut into fillets with before and after comments from the presenter, rather than trusted to flow as a conversation. The Sunday papers that trumpeted Talk TV’s debut also featured prominent adverts for Marr’s LBC show. The strikingly similar sales lines – Piers Morgan Uncensored, Marr Gets His Voice Back – imply these shows will sidestep the pettifogging editorial balance the presenters suffered at the BBC and ITV. In fact, both hosts remain subject to Ofcom regulation, as does another big mouth newcomer, GB News, so claims of saying the unsayable are marketing bravado. And, as the regulator cleared Morgan’s Good Morning Britain interviews with government ministers during lockdown – the most forensically offensive ever seen on British television – it is unclear how much further he could go in a studio. The only line drawn at ITV was over his on-air bawling-out of a colleague and subsequent storming from the studio. If Morgan flounces off this set, they’re stuffed, and that is not the only drawback of a solo show. Morgan’s most similar broadcasting venture – his CNN evening talk show from 2011-14 – failed, though that can be attributed to his being viewed in the US as an asshole Brit, only one of which objections applies in the UK. But for all Morgan’s self-obsession, the clear highlight of his TV career – the six years on ITV’s Good Morning Britain from 2015, which genuinely transformed breakfast television – owed much to co-host Susanna Reid, expert at goading or controlling him as necessary. Talk TV may discover that he’s best in a double act. Although Murdoch’s Sunday Times listed a full Monday schedule for Talk TV from 6.30am, that in fact doesn’t start until Tuesday, with Julia Hartley-Brewer’s breakfast show. On launch night, before Morgan v Trump, viewers got The News Desk, which will run week nights at 7pm, fronted by Tom Newton Dunn, whose lips were initially out of sync with his words, an ominous echo of the technical problems that blighted the birth of GB News last year. Newton Dunn is a fluent broadcaster who would probably have had a BBC career if not demonised by being political editor of the Sun. From a studio desk, he links reports mainly from Murdoch newspaper reporters on Zoom. The tone throughout was at the populist end of the spectrum. The prime minister’s threat to unleash “the terrors of the earth” on whoever made misogynist allegations against Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner was discussed as if it were a startling Johnson coinage with no footnote that it’s a quote from King Lear. A closing “news panel” avoided mention of the threat to the PM over his law-breaking, which was perhaps wise as one of the commenters was James Slack, now Sun deputy editor, whose Downing Street leaving party is one of the events investigated by Sue Gray and the police. On this early evidence, Talk TV is much slicker than GB News but far less resourced and rigorous than Sky News (a Murdoch creation that he no longer owns.) Perhaps learning from GB News being hobbled by an advertiser boycott, there was nothing that would obviously concern corporations or Ofcom, although the return to TV (from 4-7pm on Tuesday) of Jeremy Kyle, a controversialist dropped from ITV over allegations of lack of duty of care to contestants, will be watched carefully. The launch night seemed short on commercials, some breaks between segments filled with promo clips. In an increasingly crowded news broadcast market, will there be enough finance to pay Morgan’s salary, or viewers to satisfy his ego? Sorry if that’s not wokey or whiny enough for him. But he’s going to have to do much worse than this to prevent liberals falling un-woke in front of his show.",Arts/Television & radio,Piers Morgan Uncensored review – a bad Jeremy Clarkson tribute act … with added Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/25/piers-morgan-uncensored-review-a-bad-jeremy-clarkson-tribute-act-with-added-trump
4/26/2022,"‘OK Google … sensual mode.” The lighting dims in the bedsit of Andy Peacock as he whips up two espresso martinis and smoothly twirls with them to the bed, where his date is perched, coat still on, unimpressed. Andy looks up at a ceiling projection of the Milky Way, delivers a prepared speech about “the eterniddy of space” and leans in for a kiss. Within seconds the date has left, Andy is alone again and Peacock, a new BBC Three three-parter, is cementing Allan Mustafa’s reputation as British comedy’s top purveyor of preening, fragile losers.Mustafa was at the head of the ensemble in the fantastic People Just Do Nothing, playing MC Grindah, the self-absorbed leader of a gang of idiots attempting to run a pirate radio station in west London. That was a mockumentary, so the people instantly seeing through the bravado were us, the viewers. Peacock – written by Steve Stamp and Ben Murray, from the People Just Do Nothing team – is a traditional narrative comedy where Mustafa is Andy, a 36-year-old personal trainer from west London who has spent his entire working life so far in the same gym, convinced his job carries a powerful mystique that the women he meets cannot resist. The people seeing through his bravado are the women he meets.At first the heart sinks a little when we realise Mustafa is playing the same type of character he was in People Just Do Nothing, and indeed in The Curse earlier this year: the manchild whose pretensions are obvious to anyone with the common sense and confidence he lacks. Yes, Mustafa is extremely good at playing those blokes, but maybe he’d be pretty decent at something different. Early on in Peacock, when Andy mutters “Unbelievable!” in that familiar, quietly outraged mockumentary tone – after an incident where it was in fact he who was behaving unbelievably – it seems we might have a case of People Just Do One Thing.Peacock, however, is too canny in its characterisation, and too specific in its setting, to just be more of the same. Andy is the classic lothario singleton with deep insecurity behind the neatly maintained beard, still trying to jockey his mates into doing shots on his “Mandem Monday” nights out and aghast when the pals who have acquired wives and lives make their excuses and leave early. But Andy’s work as a “PT” opens up a particular seam of modern masculinity, that of the gym bro: guys who might once have had a sports car or chunky watch, now obsessing over protein shakes and what kind of squats build the shapeliest glutes. Andy’s tragedy is that he sees himself as that sort of geezer, but isn’t fully committed because underneath it all he’s a conservative, soft-willed goof. Good gags, subtle and not so, are thoughtfully sprinkled through the opening half-hour. The pompous “mmm” noise Mustafa makes, closing his eyes as Andy sips champagne before doling out a horribly cheesy line about his personal training philosophy (“The mind … is the most important muscle of all”), is a nice touch, as is the fact that his bedsit is on the top floor of his parents’ house. Andy has had a postbox installed on the landing wall and the number 36A stuck on the door: “It’s a completely separate property!” Mustafa’s comic instincts are unerring, giving Andy all the necessary desperation and just a smidgeon of threat – although whereas PJDN boldly showed us how bleak it was to be Grindah’s neglected girlfriend, here the agony is all Andy’s. The show is aware of the potentially queasy sexual politics of the gym, but in a scene where Andy is primed to take advantage of a client who’s turned on by his trainer’s uniform, he quickly ruins the vibe with his neuroses. The power is all hers. Similarly, Andy’s retrograde chat about “bros before hoes” and a “ball and chain” is shot down by other, more emotionally developed male characters. He’s well paired with Thomas Gray as Spooner, the faithful colleague who is about to recognise Andy as ridiculous, but is too polite not to go along with his laddishness. Spooner is expecting a baby with his wry, confidently relaxed partner, Blue (Sophia di Martino, who after her starring turn in Loki is a bit of a casting coup for a low-key BBC Three sitcom), and the dynamic between the trio – before they have their own child, Spooner and Blue will have to parent Andy through his looming identity crisis – is tenderly judged. Yes, in the era of comedy post-Brent and Partridge, blithe berks who eventually win our sympathy have been everywhere, but sitcom men have had a lot of stuff to work through. Peacock puts them one step closer to moving on.",Arts/Television & radio,Peacock review – ready for the new David Brent or Alan Partridge?
