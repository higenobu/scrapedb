12/27/2021,"Rising energy prices will hand Rishi Sunak a “windfall” of £3.1bn since October’s budget, a Labour analysis has claimed, which the party has urged the chancellor to spend on cutting household bills. Labour said the receipts would cover the projected £2.4bn cost of removing VAT from gas and electricity bills over the winter months .  The figures come from House of Commons library research, commissioned by Labour, which projects £3.1bn extra in VAT receipts in 2021-22, making a total of £135bn. Labour’s figures were reached using the Office for Budget Responsibility’s (OBR) projections that 42.2% of VAT receipts will come from November to March. This suggests that, with £78bn raised to October 2021, a little under £57bn may be expected over the rest of the year. This would bring total VAT receipts to about £135bn. At the budget in October, the OBR forecast £131.9bn for 2021-22. However, the Treasury said those increases would not come close to meeting pre-pandemic forecasts. A government spokesperson said: “There has been no VAT windfall. VAT receipts this year are forecast to be below the pre-Covid level, with the OBR forecasting nearly £2bn less will be received this year compared with directly before the pandemic.” But the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said the additional cash compared with pre-budget forecasts meant the chancellor could give some relief on energy bills. “Right now people are being hit by a cost of living crisis which has seen energy bills soar, food costs increase and the weekly budget stretched. That’s why Labour is calling on the government to immediately remove VAT on household heating bills over the winter months.” Reeves said further action was needed to protect households from escalating bills after the next review of the energy price cap, which some experts have predicted could rise by as much as 40% when Ofgem sets it again in February. The energy regulator is also expected to enact a series of changes after the collapse of so many small providers. The cap for the average household is £1,277 a year, but the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change estimated it could rise to almost £1,800. “We need a sustainable and ambitious approach to energy, which is why Labour would also ramp up ambition with our plan to retrofit 19m homes, making our energy supply chain more secure without hitting household savings,” Reeves said. “On top of the biggest tax burden in 70 years, Conservative complacency is making the cost of living crisis worse and storing up long-term problems, with working people paying the price.” A Treasury spokesperson said it had concluded that high energy prices would reduce VAT revenues due to the 5% VAT rate on the supply of domestic fuel and power. Higher prices overall meant if people spent more on energy, where VAT was lower, they would spend less on goods and services that on average had a much higher VAT rate, thereby reducing VAT revenue overall. “We are supporting vulnerable households with the cost of energy through initiatives such as the warm home discount, which is being increased to £150 and extended to cover an extra 750,000 households, winter fuel payments, and cold weather payments,” the spokesperson said.",News/Politics,"Rising energy prices will give Treasury £3.1bn windfall, says Labour",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/27/rising-energy-prices-will-give-treasury-31bn-windfall-says-labour-vat-receipts-rishi-sunak
12/27/2021,"Four of the last five winners of the Welsh Grand National are back for another crack at the race on Monday, including Native River, the 2018 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner, who will attempt to repeat his memorable success under top weight of 11st 12lb five years ago. Colin Tizzard’s chaser would be a hugely popular winner but he needs something close to a career-best performance to win off 166 just a few days before his 12th birthday and others make more appeal.  Secret Reprieve has not been out since winning this race last season but should go well again from a 6lb higher mark, while the Irish challenger The Big Dog also has obvious claims on his winning form at Punchestown in February. The strongest recent form on offer, though, could well be the London National at Sandown earlier this month, where Highland Hunter edged out Deise Aba (2.50) by a nose. Philip Hobbs’s eight-year-old, who is 4lb better off this time, looks a more reliable proposition this season after returning form figures of PP1P last term and is definitely worth an interest on Monday at around 14-1. Chepstow 1.05 When You’re Ready built on the promise of his chasing debut to win with something to spare over course and distance last time out and a 7lb rise in the weights is unlikely to stop his progress. Kempton Park 1.20 Edwardstone has a 5lb penalty for his win in the Grade One Henry VIII Novice Chase at Sandown last time but appears to have significantly more than that in hand of his three opponents here. Chepstow 1.40 A suitably strong field for this Grade One juvenile hurdle, with Skycutter, a front-running winner in a good time at Musselburgh earlier this month, perhaps the value bet at around 6-1 to extend his unbeaten record to three races. Kempton Park 1.55 Coded Message has been dropped a couple of pounds since a close fourth at Ascot and could make the most of it in a competitive contest. Chepstow 2.10 Geordie Des Champs was back to form at Uttoxeter in November and can double up off a 4lb higher mark.

12/27/2021,"Three victims of the serial killer Stephen Port might still be alive today were it not for a shoddy police investigation that was the result of “ineptitude, poor systems and underfunding”, the producer of a new drama about the crimes has said. Jeff Pope is senior producer of Four Lives, a dramatisation for BBC One of the murders of four young gay men: Anthony Walgate, 23; Gabriel Kovari, 22; Daniel Whitworth, 21; and Jack Taylor, 21.  It stars Stephen Merchant as Port and Sheridan Smith as Sarah Sak, the mother of Walgate, who campaigned to prove her son had been drugged, raped and murdered. The initial police finding was that the death was unexplained but not suspicious. Pope said that when they started on the project he thought the failure to investigate Walgate’s death properly was going to be a story of “rampant homophobia” in the police. “But it’s actually more worrying than that,” he told the Radio Times. “The shoddy investigation was due to ineptitude, poor systems, underfunding.” Pope said that with cases such as the abduction and murder of Sarah Everard by the serving Met police officer Wayne Couzens, “it has become common to describe the police as ‘dysfunctional’ or ‘not fit for purpose’. So, in that sense, Four Lives is the story of the day. In this case, the dysfunctionality led to deaths. If they’d investigated Anthony Walgate’s killing properly, the other three men would still be alive.” Pope has been involved, as writer or producer, in some of the most watched and well-received real crime dramas of recent years, including about the serial killers Fred and Rose West. Pope said he was most shocked to discover that the reason the first Stephen Port murder was not investigated as suspicious, instead recorded as unexplained, was that it saved money. “Because a suspicious death costs more, as it involves searching laptops and forensic tests.” All four families of the victims gave consent or cooperation to the production. It was ready for transmission a year ago but has been delayed because of inquests into the deaths. Those inquests concluded this month when a jury found that police failings probably contributed to three of the four deaths. Pope and the writer Neil McKay are also working on a dramatisation of Jimmy Savile’s crimes, starring Steve Coogan. They said a future project, could be the Manchester Arena bombings of 2017.",News/UK news,"Police ‘ineptitude’ contributed to Stephen Port murders, says producer",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/27/police-ineptitude-contributed-to-stephen-port-murders-says-producer
