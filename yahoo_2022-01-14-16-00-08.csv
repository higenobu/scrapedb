1/14/2022,"Former Nissan boss and international fugitive Carlos Ghosn predicts a major reordering of the power center in the auto industry, he told Axios in an exclusive interview. Why it matters: Ghosn was once one of the automotive industry's most powerful leaders — among the first major execs to invest in electric vehicles. His comments now come during a major inflection point in the sector's transition to EVs as companies battle for positioning.

The once-globe-trotting citizen of Lebanon, Brazil and France spoke on Zoom from his home in Beirut, holding his phone vertically and reclining on a couch with a sprawling bookcase in the background. Ghosn tells Axios he’s not interested in leading a major automotive company anymore, even if his charges disappear, saying he no longer has the motivation to do so. But he’s happy to consult with companies that contact him about how to tackle electric vehicles and self-driving cars. “I’m trying to help companies get rid of the past,” he says. Ghosn had high praise for Tesla and Elon Musk, marveling at the company surpassing $1 trillion in market capitalization. He says companies like Tesla and Rivian are best positioned to win the EV race. The big picture: Ghosn predicts traditional automakers like Nissan, GM and Ford won’t be able to keep up with startups, which “don’t have the rigidity of mind.” He acknowledges that GM and Ford, in particular, have made progress with the introduction of electric pickups like the Chevrolet Silverado and Ford F-150 Lightning. But he says they'll continue to shrink. “A lot of companies are going to be left behind,” he says. “If you don’t go 100% electric, you’re not going to be part of this industry anymore.” Catch up fast: Japanese authorities and Nissan in late 2018 alleged that Ghosn underreported his compensation, a crime in Japan. He’s denied any wrongdoing. A year later, Ghosn escaped house arrest in an elaborate plot. He tucked himself inside a musical equipment box to elude the police and airport security, and flew through Turkey on his way to his boyhood Lebanon, which has no extradition treaty with Japan and hasn’t taken action against him. More than half a dozen alleged accomplices were later arrested. What’s next: If he can’t get Japan to drop charges or if Interpol doesn't withdraw its “red notice” seeking his detainment, Ghosn may spend the rest of his life in Lebanon. Ghosn tells Axios he’s still irate at what he called Japan’s “hostage justice system,” given its 99.3% conviction rate. He maintains his innocence and the innocence of fellow former Nissan executive Greg Kelly, who is facing charges on accusations he helped Ghosn obscure his compensation. “I frankly do not believe in the system. I think it’s a joke,” he says. “They don’t give a sh*t about us.” The other side: The Japanese embassy did not respond to a request for comment, and Nissan declined to comment. Defenders of the Japanese judicial system say local prosecutors have a high conviction rate in part because they only take on 37% of arrest cases, according to a report published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The bottom line: Ghosn might be stuck in Lebanon, but expect him to remain an influential presence in the automotive industry regardless of his legal situation.

Hair loss and balding may be commonly associated with men, but female pattern baldness and thinning hair affects 50 per cent of women.  According to the Canadian Dermatology Association, approximately 40 per cent of women experience signs of thinning hair by the age of 50. While some changes to your hair are temporary, others can be a red flag for female pattern baldness and experts say there are signs you should watch out for. It’s normal to lose up to 100 hairs a day and for someone who doesn’t shampoo their hair often that number can be higher on hair-washing days. Hair loss becomes abnormal when you start noticing changes to your hair that don’t seem to be getting better with time. “If someone finds they have ongoing hair loss or they have hair loss that’s accompanied by itching, burning or tenderness, they really need an evaluation [by a specialist],” says Dr. Jeff Donovan, a hair loss specialist and the president of the Canadian Hair Loss Foundation. Female pattern baldness, also known as androgenetic alopecia, is a hereditary condition that occurs when the hair follicle becomes damaged or slows down growth. While it's similar to male pattern baldness the main difference of female pattern baldness is where the thinning occurs on the scalp.  For women, the thinning often begins in the middle of the scalp and the crown, and can eventually affect the entire scalp. Whereas for men, thinning of the hair generally begins at the temples and the crown. Low iron levels, stress, a recent pregnancy and certain medications can all cause temporary hair loss. The more permanent hair loss associated with female pattern baldness is usually caused by genetics, although it's not alway that easy to explain. “It's something we see in 15 to 20 per cent of women,"" Donovan explains to Yahoo Canada. ""There may be some genetics in the family tree and great-grandparents that we don’t quite get a sense of, but we know it’s more complicated than just family trees and family history."" The Canadian Hair Loss Foundation notes a common sign of female pattern baldness is the widening of the central part of the hair at the top of your scalp. The hair thinning becomes most evident on the top and sides of the head.  Another sign of female pattern baldness is changes to the diameter of your ponytail. If you've noticed your ponytail thinning or an increased amount of shedding, it may be time to see your doctor or dermatologist.  While many women will begin noticing changes to their hair in their 30s and 40s, it's possible for women in their teens and 20s to report thinning hair.   According to Donovan, about six to 10 per cent of women will experience hair thinning in late high school or early university. “I always tell the doctors I teach that if a patient comes in to see you at 17 or 18, don’t have in your mind that female balding doesn’t occur at this age because you’re going to miss these important diagnoses,” Donovan adds. “It certainly can occur in many ages.” Each person knows their hair the best and needs to pay attention to any changes that are happening. If you notice pro-longed differences with your hair, the first recommended step is to see a family physician. A doctor can check iron and thyroid levels and review any medications you are taking before referring you to a specialist. “If hair loss goes beyond six months or there’s hair loss on the scalp accompanied by eyebrow loss or eyelash loss or body hair loss then I encourage patients to really seek the advice of a specialist,” Donovan adds. While there is no cure for female pattern hair loss, treatments are available. Health Canada and U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved topical treatments like Minoxidil or Rogaine, have been used for more than 30 years to treat thinning hair and hair loss.  A doctor can also recommend hair transplants or a newer treatment called Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy (PRP) which uses a patient’s blood cells to accelerate healing in a specific area.  If you want to go the non-medical route you can use hair pieces or wigs to camouflage the hair loss. While hair loss is incredibly complicated, there are certain lifestyle factors, such as smoking, that can accelerate hair loss. In addition, colouring your hair and wearing hair extensions can cause damage to the hair and scalp.  Even though there’s not enough research for any consistent dietary recommendations, Donovan believes obesity can accelerate genetic hair loss and that maintaining a good body weight is important.
