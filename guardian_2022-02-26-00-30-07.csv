2/26/2022,"If I look out of the window as I’m writing this, I can see the grand, stuccoed Russian embassy in London, which some years ago mounted a large screen on the wall outside, on which it likes to broadcast its frequently obnoxious Twitter feed to passersby. If I look at the television screen in the room in which I’m sitting, I can see a despairing Ukrainian woman throwing her broken windows from her apartment building in the aftermath of a shelling. So yes: it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. This afternoon, when I walk down to the opticians, I will pass some large, unconvincingly spontaneous graffiti that recently appeared on someone else’s wall. It reads: “There is no Russian interference in elections.” (Kids, eh?) Next, I will pass two vast houses that I know to be owned by oligarchs – one of whom is Roman Abramovich – and two others that are heavily rumoured to be. Some of these properties are on a street that also hosts various ambassadorial residences, and they are therefore protected obligingly around the clock by multiple armed British police officers. Just a tiny snapshot from a London that is uniquely placed to hurt Russia’s richest and most powerful – the class who could ultimately help decide how long Vladimir Putin sticks around. Yet London continues to pull its punches. In a mirthless sort of way, I enjoyed Boris Johnson thundering on Thursday that “oligarchs in London will have nowhere to hide”. Righto. That same morning, Andrey Guryev, the reported owner of Witanhurst, London’s second largest house after Buckingham Palace, could be seen on telly at Putin’s meeting of the oligarchs in the Kremlin. Not a great hiding place – but then, perhaps Andrey knows the seeker is so quarter-arsed he doesn’t actually need one. London’s fight against oligarchs reminds me a lot of Russia’s fight against doping in sports. Some real through-the-looking-glass stuff. Anyway, I say that Guryev is the “reported owner” of Witanhurst, because even that simple fact remains extraordinarily difficult to establish, to say nothing of more controversial information. For so many of these Russian persons of interest, the internet management alone is a full-time job. But then, there are so very many full-timers. In a few weeks you will be able to buy the brilliant Oliver Bullough’s new book, Butler to the World, in which he details how the UK became the servant of some of the world’s worst individuals. To help the oligarchs, the kleptocrats and the gangsters, Londongrad boasts a whole humming, interconnected professional class of reality-launderers specifically designed to service them – lawyers and lobbyists and education consultants and all sorts of others who imagine themselves to work for respectable businesses. But don’t. I thought of them when I read an article by Marta Shokalo, editor of the BBC’s Ukrainian service, written in the hours after the invasion began on Thursday. She described hearing the explosions in Kyiv and, later, getting her 10-year-old son up and dressed. “We had some breakfast, sitting as far from the windows as we could,” she wrote, “but he was so scared he vomited.” Reading this yesterday before supper with my own children I felt such a deep, painful sympathy for her. There is no one working to launder reality for her child. There is no army of sharp-suited professionals lavishing painstaking hours on making all the bad stuff go away for Ukrainian children, two of whom were reportedly killed in the past 24 hours by Russian strikes on civilian targets. It is their misfortune – their tragedy – to live at the sharp end of Vladimir Putin’s wickedness, while the megarich who exist in grotesque symbiosis with the Russian president have their every rough edge smoothed off in this capital they most adore to call home. Or, as Bullough now asks: “Why are we preferring Russian oligarchs over Ukrainian kids?” Why indeed? I don’t want to go out on a limb here, but Britain’s professed attempt to deter Putin with sanctions was arguably hindered by not imposing any even remotely irksome sanctions until after he’d actually invaded Ukraine. Less “stop or we’ll shoot”, more “shoot or we’ll stop”. For so long now, the urgency and gravitas that successive governments have brought to this problem are epitomised by Gavin Williamson’s comment that “Russia should go away and should shut up”. That, you might recall, came in the wake of Putin deploying a nerve agent on our soil. Even now, just typing those words is a proper mindmelt. Not one month before, the wife of Putin’s former deputy finance minister had successfully bid £30,000 at a Tory party fundraiser to have dinner with Williamson at the Churchill war rooms. Indeed, this same woman, Lubov Chernukhin, has spent a fortune buying time with politicians, including £160,000 to play tennis with David Cameron and Boris Johnson. The year after Salisbury, she paid £135,000 for “a night out with Theresa May”. (I know, I know – second prize was two nights out with Theresa May.) We’ve even seen a picture of this soiree, thanks to trigger-happy Instagrammer Liz Truss, who came along for the fun, along with several other senior Tory women. The future foreign secretary genuinely captioned the picture: “And it’s ladies night #cabinetandfriends #girlpower.” As one fellow attender fumed of Truss, she’d “dropped them in it for the sake of a few likes”. Which sounds like the words of someone who’d prefer that their money-grubbing and influence-peddling happened in secret. In Londongrad, of course, they would be in positively multitudinous company. As Putin closes in physically on Ukraine’s capital, our own capital has yet to properly instigate a reckoning with itself. Instead, the people with power to hit his cronies where it hurts still prefer to just shut up and go away.

While Antonio Conte’s Tottenham have lost four of their past five League games, most recently at Burnley in midweek, Marcelo Bielsa’s Leeds are on the brink of a relegation battle. Their 6-0 thrashing at Liverpool last week emphasised the team’s defensive vulnerabilities but few expect Bielsa to modify his attacking philosophy against Harry Kane and company.

2/26/2022,"Kim Kardashian says that social media posts made by her husband, Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, have caused emotional distress, according to new court documents. In the documents filed on Wednesday and obtained by NBC, Kardashian, 41, asked the judge to sign off on her divorce with Ye, 41, so that she can “begin the healing process” and “move forward”. “I very much desire to be divorced,” wrote Kardashian, adding that Ye has failed to keep the divorce proceedings between the two private. “Kanye has been putting a lot of misinformation regarding our private family matters and co-parenting on social media which has created emotional distress.” Kardashian further noted that a termination of her and Ye’s marital status could help him “accept that our marital relationship is over and to move forward on a better path which will assist us in peacefully co-parenting our children”. The two have four children: North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm. Kardashian previously filed for divorce in February 2021 after the two had been married for seven years. In December, Kardashian requested that she be “legally single”, which would divide the divorce proceedings into two parts: the first would settle her legal name and marital status while the second would determine custody of the couple’s four children. Ye has objected to having the process split. Since the start of the divorce proceedings, he has made several posts on Instagram about the state of his ex-partner and children, including speaking out against his oldest daughter North’s TikTok account. In a post published yesterday, Ye seemingly bragged about Kardashian’s current boyfriend, comedian and actor Pete Davidson, deleting his Instagram account, writing: “Ran Skete off the gram Tell your mother I changed your name for life.” Last month, Ye apologized for posting screenshots of messages between himself and Kardashian, where Kardashian was worried about Davidson’s safety due to Ye’s post. Ye also acknowledged in the since-deleted apology post that his posting “came off as harassing Kim”.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Kim Kardashian details distress caused by Kanye West in new court documents,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/25/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-divorce-documents-ye-social-media-posts
2/26/2022,"You might say Marcus Smith is more blessed with the hands of god but when I think about Manu Tuilagi and how he is so often billed as England’s saviour I cannot help but think of someone like Diego Maradona. Manu-dona if you will. Maybe it’s a nickname that works better for Maro Itoje but there is no one else in the England setup for whom there is almost a messianic vision whenever he is fit to play. I was reflecting after the autumn how we had seen Smith, Tuilagi and Henry Slade start together for less than 10 minutes and now they haven’t even made it to the start line. First and foremost it’s a monumental disappointment for Tuilagi himself, having fought back from injury, but he has been here before and he will get himself in the right frame of mind to come back later in the tournament. You also can’t underestimate how keenly his absence will be felt in the squad and not just because they’ve lost one of their best baristas. He’s an incredibly popular player and he is one of the best gainline players in the world. Put simply, his sheer presence on the field breeds confidence around him. I expect Joe Marchant to come in and that represents both a challenge and an opportunity for him. A challenge because he left the England camp on Tuesday and spent the rest of the week preparing to play on the wing for Harlequins at Worcester. Adapting to what he will now face is tough but it is an opportunity: no disrespect to Worcester, but as a former player I know where I’d rather be. It helps that he is a very intelligent rugby player as well. He has the skills to cope, he just needs to embrace the challenge if Eddie Jones does hand him the starting jersey. That would mean a shift to inside-centre for Slade but maybe the player Tuilagi’s absence affects the most is Harry Randall. He was selected to start at scrum-half to bring a quick tempo, to inject some real pace at the start of the match and fundamental to that would have been the gainline power of Tuilagi. For all that Marchant would bring, he does not bring that kind of threat so Randall’s game management skills are going to be tested by Wales. There has been a clamour for Randall to start due to his form and the excitement he brings, but now he has been picked there is a sense of surprise. I’m thrilled for him and I hope the day is made equally memorable for Ben Youngs if he comes off the bench and breaks the great Jason Leonard’s all-time men’s caps record. I love the confidence shown in Randall by Jones, I love that conviction to build towards the future and next year’s World Cup but there is still part of me, the cautious part, that looks to all that experience Youngs brings, all those caps, and feels a bit of concern. All the more so without the gainline power of Tuilagi. Randall, like several of the players in this team, will be sampling a Six Nations match at Twickenham for the first time but I do not share the concerns some people will have over that inexperience. I believe they will have learned a lot from the disappointment of the defeat by Scotland and the bad press that followed. I just sense that the personality of this team has changed. It ismore open, it is really honest and there is a far better aggregation of thoughts than under previous regimes and previous captains. Courtney Lawes takes a lot of credit for that and the significance of his return cannot be underestimated. Looking from the outside, it feels as if the bandwidth of knowledge, while it has always been there, now comes more from all of the group rather than certain sections. In previous leadership roles there was a group made up of Saracens, but not any more. There’s a better ability to test the temperature of the squad, and understand how the whole group is feeling. The division of leadership labour is distributed more evenly across players from different clubs, which allows everyone to fully understand where the squad is, who they are, what they want to be, how they’re feeling and how they are behaving. That will be crucial on Saturday because, make no mistake, this is now knockout rugby. Ireland have a pass this weekend, maybe France do too because they’ve won both their matches, but for Scotland, England and Wales this is quarter-final weekend. Win, and they move on to the semis, still in the hunt for the title. Lose and they are out of the running. Feeding the England players that message is a fine balance because they have to understand the gravity of the game against Wales in isolation, as well as the bearing it has on the championship. The players have to understand that without being put under so much pressure that it paralyses them. On the whole I’m optimistic about England’s chances. The fallow week came at a good time for them, having their captain back is a huge bonus, and there is a more settled feel to the team now. It’s not far off the team that could be playing in a World Cup quarter-final in 18 months’ time. The obvious exception is Tuilagi but if Saturday shows anything, it must be that England can cope without him.",Sport/Sport,You can’t underestimate how big a loss Manu-dona is for England | Ugo Monye,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/manu-tuilagi-absence-will-be-keenly-felt-throughout-england-team-against-wales

2/26/2022,"My former wife, Anne Edmonds, who has died aged 67 of cancer, was a small-business director who helped to make our joint software company a success. After starting her career in publishing, she changed tack and directed her interests to maritime life based in south Devon. Anne was born in Newmarket, Suffolk, to Jean (nee Backhouse) and Colonel Nicol Gray, who served in the Royal Marines in Normandy in the second world war and as a police chief in Palestine and in Malaysia. She attended Mayfield girls’ boarding school, East Sussex, and studied French and German literature at Newnham College, Cambridge. After graduating in the mid 1970s, she joined publishers Hamish Hamilton as an editor. Among the titles she edited was Testimony, the memoirs of Shostakovich. She also co-translated The Tunnel by André Lacaze, his harrowing account of Mauthausen concentration camp. Anne was not happy in the publishing world and in her 20s felt she needed a change. In 1981 she joined the Island Cruising Club in Salcombe, which ran six large yachts offering sailing holidays in the Channel and further afield. It offered a fantastic opportunity for a career break in a challenging environment, and Anne became cook on the schooner Hoshi and then cook/mate on the ketch Lucretia. I was mate on the Hoshi when she arrived. We married in 1983. Being strapped into the galley in bad weather to prepare hot food made her an accomplished cook. She was also a proficient navigator and yachtswoman. In 1984 she joined Devonport Dockyard as assistant editor of the Dockyard News. She became editor and, when Babcock International took over in 1987, head of PR. In 1986 we started our own business, PC Maritime, developing training software for yachtspeople and later training simulators and electronic chart systems for commercial navigators and ships. Anne took charge of marketing and PR and was skilled at dealing with people from all over the world, conducting business in French, German, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese. We divorced in 2014 but remained close business partners. She continued working in the company until her illness prevented it. Anne was without ego. Few knew the breadth of her accomplishments because of her characteristic modesty. She had many friends in Modbury, south Devon, where she lived with her partner, Bob Fitzsimmons. She enjoyed cycling and was a member of the Brent Singers community choir. She was a lifelong Guardian reader. Anne is survived by our sons, Nicol and Harry, by Bob and by her stepson, Mark.",Sport/Sport,Anne Edmonds obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/anne-edmonds-obituary
2/26/2022,"Turn on Russian state television on Friday afternoon and you will see little sign that the country’s missiles are pounding the Ukrainian capital. Instead, the full force of the state propaganda machine has been mobilised to portray Moscow’s invasion as a defensive campaign to “liberate” Ukraine, focusing much of its coverage on the alleged protection of the Donbas, supposedly under attack by Kyiv. “Our situation is very concerning. The enemy is attacking our positions, entering civilian houses,” said Leonid Pasechnik, the leader of the self-proclaimed republic in Luhansk, to the Rossiya-24 channel. A breaking news banner on Channel One said that “Ukraine launched three missiles at the Donetsk People’s Republic in the last seven minutes”. The Russian state news mostly follows Vladimir Putin’s narrative on the war, which he laid out in his address to the nation early on Thursday morning when he announced a limited “special military operation” to “demilitarise” Ukraine and protect citizens in the Donbas from what he claimed was a Ukrainian “genocide”. Throughout Friday morning, a Russian assault on the Ukrainian capital was often simply denied. “Kyiv, as a city where civilians live, hasn’t been bombed by anyone. There hasn’t been any terror there or instructions to cause such terror,” said the Channel One pundit Artyom Sheinin on Friday, contradicting the myriad of reports that have shown the opposite. As it becomes harder for state media to ignore the full-scale invasion into Ukrainian territory, some channels have started to frame Russian soldiers as eagerly anticipated liberators. “The people in the city Kharkiv only have one issue with the Russian army: ‘What took you so long?’” said Olga Skabeyeva, one of the country’s most prominent state television hosts. Coverage of the invasion contrasts steeply with that of other Russian military campaigns. During Russia’s 2015 military intervention in Syria, viewers were often treated to flashy videos of fighter jets destroying their targets. The avoidance of such videos this time serves as a sign that Russian authorities are aware of the country’s deep unease with the conflict. Television remains the biggest news source for Russians despite becoming less trusted over the past decade, past polling has found, and 62% of the population say they get their news from television. But polls also show that most people under 40 prefer to get their news online and from social media. Despite a state crackdown on Russian media, readers can still choose from several independent outlets that have been reporting critically on the country’s involvement in the war, including the popular online platform Meduza and the television channel Dozhd – both recently branded as “foreign agents”. Those who can read English are still able to access foreign press, and there are also many popular independent Telegram channels run by journalists turned bloggers. In contrast to WhatsApp, the widely used encrypted messaging app Telegram allows readers to “follow” users in a similar way to Twitter, which is accessed by only 3% of the population. Alexei Pivovarov, a veteran Russian journalist, runs a channel with almost 500,000 followers, aggregating independent news on the war coming from Russia, Ukraine and the west. Other channels are more opinionated. Commenting on a recent statement by the Kremlin official Valentina Matviyenko, who defended the invasion by saying it “was is the only option to stop a brotherly war”, the Telegram user Stalingulag wrote to his 300,000 followers: “This is pure Orwell, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery.” Signs are emerging that the Kremlin will try to gain a monopoly on the way Russians perceive events in Ukraine by censoring independent outlets reporting on the war. On Thursday Russia’s media watchdog, Roskomnadzor, demanded that Russian media cite only “official information and data” when covering the conflict. The watchdog vowed to immediately block outlets that did not comply with the order. In a similar move, Russia previously threatened to block at least 10 news outlets unless they deleted their coverage of video investigations by the jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny into high-level corruption. Most outlets gave in to the demands. Over at the state broadcaster RT – which has parroted many of the themes on the war that were aired on Russian state television – the first signs have emerged that its staff are uncomfortable with the network’s war coverage. At least one English-language RT staff member and one frequent RT contributor in Moscow have quit the network in recent days over the editorial position on the war, the Guardian has learned. “In light of recent events, earlier today I resigned from RT with immediate effect,” the former RT staff news writer in Moscow Jonny Tickle tweeted on Thursday. The frequent RT contributor who resigned said, on condition of anonymity, that there had “been an exodus of staff already” at the channel. “Several people already quit – and lots more said to be contemplating.”",News/World news,‘Pure Orwell’: how Russian state media spins invasion as liberation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/pure-orwell-how-russian-state-media-spins-ukraine-invasion-as-liberation
2/26/2022,"The contrast between the tiny austere cell on Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela spent 18 of his 27 years in jail, and the infinite diversity of the digital world could not be greater. But the two will come together next month when the first non-fungible tokens (NFTs) of artwork by the former South African president and anti-apartheid hero are sold against the backdrop of a booming global digital art market. My Robben Island consists of five vivid watercolours painted by Mandela after he stood down as president in 1999, plus The Motivation, a handwritten text that explains his visualisation of the harsh island prison. All six works bear his signature. In The Motivation, Mandela writes: “It is true that Robben Island was once a place of darkness, but out of that darkness has come a wonderful brightness, a light so powerful that it could not be hidden behind prison walls, held back behind prison bars or hemmed in by the surrounding sea … The most fantastic dreams can be achieved if we are prepared to endure life’s challenges.” Makaziwe Mandela, the former president’s daughter, said her father’s watercolours represented “the triumph of the human spirit”. She said: “When my dad was on the island, he was surrounded by grey. Remember, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. He never thought he would walk out of prison. But the paintings say we should never despair.” Offering the artworks as NFTs was a way of reaching new audiences, she added. “My dad was all about creating an accessible society. This is a way of democratising his art.” Giles Peppiatt, the director of modern and contemporary African art at Bonhams, which is selling the NFTs, said digital art reached “new audiences that probably don’t go to art galleries and museums”. “These are people who live a lot of their life through their phones, through the internet, and who have large amounts of money at their disposal – and they are collectors. They are becoming a more and more important part of the art market,” he said. Sales of NFTs have rocketed in the past couple of years, fuelled by young buyers who have made fortunes from cryptocurrencies and other technologies. An NFT titled Everydays: the First 5,000 Days by Mike Winkelmann, the digital artist known as Beeple, sold for a record $69m last March. My Robben Island will be offered for sale in a six-hour period on 9 March at a fixed price of $3,495 for the edition, or $699 for an individual work. There is no set number for sale, although there is an upper limit of 10,000. “However many are sold in that six-hour window is the edition,” said Peppiatt. The watercolours, painted in 2002 as a therapeutic activity under the guidance of the art teacher Varenka Paschke, were “very good, rather sad and poignant. You couldn’t get more personal images,” Peppiatt said. The Cell shows the interior of the space Mandela occupied during his Robben Island years. It has become a place of pilgrimage whose visitors have included Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Mandela’s meagre possessions are piled beneath the window. The Window depicts the outline of Table Mountain, seen through vivid orange bars. The Harbour was the first sight of the prison experienced by new inmates as they arrived by boat. The Lighthouse and The Church – prisoners were barred from entry – were island landmarks. “Robben Island is a place where courage endured in the face of endless hardship, a place where people kept on believing when it seemed their dreams were hopeless,” wrote Mandela in The Motivation. Makaziwe Mandela said she hoped some of the money raised by the NFT sale would help pay for a memorial garden being created at Qunu, where her father is buried. “Hopefully we will be able to finish the garden before I close my eyes,” she said.",News/World news,Nelson Mandela paintings of life in prison to be sold as NFTs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/nelson-mandela-paintings-of-life-in-prison-to-be-sold-as-nfts

Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a bowl. When the milk mix is warm, add the flour mix and stir until it turns into a thick paste and the mixture starts to bubble. Take off the heat and scrape into a blender. Add the almond butter (or praline paste) and egg yolk to the blender jug, and blitz to a smooth paste. Pour into a bowl, cover with clingfilm (you want the film to touch the surface of the batter, to prevent a skin from forming) and set aside to cool. When the mixture has cooled and is no longer warm to the touch, heat the oven to 190C (170 fan)/375F/gas 5. Put the almond base mixture in a large bowl and beat gently until soft and pliable. Make the meringue: whip the egg whites until frothy, then gradually add the sugar and whip to stiff peaks. Fold the meringue into the almond base, until the mixture is light and there are no lumps of meringue. You now have your souffle mixture. Lay out the crepes flat on a large baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Spoon the souffle mixture over one half of each crepe, dividing the mix evenly between them, then gently fold the empty half of each crepe over the top of the filling. Bake for eight to 10 minutes, until the filling has puffed up. Meanwhile, make the sauce: put all the ingredients in a saucepan and stir over a gentle heat until melted and smooth. When the crepes are ready, remove them from the oven and serve immediately with the hot chocolate sauce, a dusting of icing sugar and toasted almonds.

2/26/2022,"British teeth have long been the subject of jokes, from Austin Powers’ gnashers to the “big book of British smiles” used to scare Lisa Simpson into wearing her braces. But are British teeth actually getting worse? As Covid shines a light on the growing gaps in oral health inequalities, I asked Paul Woodhouse, Stockton-on-Tees dentist and British Dental Association board member. Hi, Paul, how was work?Coco, it’s carnage. Nonstop. I heard there was a backlog of 37 million NHS appointments due to practice closures during Covid – although I still don’t fully understand the difference between NHS and private appointments. Is it based on income?No, anyone can have NHS treatment. It’s free if you’re on benefits, and everyone else pays banded dental charges. The good part for patients is that if they need one filling, it’s band 2, £65.20. If they need 20 fillings, it’s still band 2, £65.20. Though that means sometimes patients will save up work, staying in pain until they’ve got other problems, or refusing work they need in the more expensive band 3. That reminds me of a friend in the US who had a car accident but couldn’t afford to go to hospital. When it comes to teeth, we’re almost as bad.One hundred per cent. I’ve had people try to pull their own teeth out, file them, put glue in them. And this was long before Covid. Children, too: the most common reason children end up in A&E is for a dental procedure. Yet we have no national strategy for the prevention of tooth decay. Will the usual 5% rise in dental charges help?That only reduces the amount the government has to give dentists. The government doesn’t fund enough dentistry for the population, and half the money comes from patient charges anyway. It’s so wrong – I’ve had grannies use their winter heating payments for dentures. I’m still confused: when I needed to find a new dentist, I rang loads of surgeries and they all kept saying they weren’t taking NHS patients.That’s because of the target system. Dental practices are allocated funding from NHS England and assigned a target of activity to achieve it. In my practice, it’s about 30,000 units of activity. A checkup is one unit, a filling is three, a crown is 12. However, if a patient comes in and needs 10 fillings, three root canals and four extractions, you still get three units of activity. So with private patients, the practice knows what they’ll receive, which is why they get prioritised. Got it! That is one of the most counterproductive systems I have heard of.In 2008, the health select committee said the system wasn’t fit for purpose. And yet no government has changed it. It’s why dentists are quitting the NHS. The media loves to talk about dentists driving flashy cars, and people love sharing horror stories: the number of people talking about a dentist kneeling on their chest! I couldn’t get my leg that high. It sounds like an advanced yogic move – “upward facing dentist”.I’m an old-school lefty. I think the NHS should be free at the point of access, including teeth and eyes. It’s frustrating when you can’t spend time with patients, or try a treatment where a tooth might be saved because the NHS system pushes you to take it out. We want to give people the best care. There is nothing so rewarding as helping someone out of pain.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Are British teeth getting worse?

2/26/2022,"The investigation into whether Donald Trump broke federal records laws when he took White House documents home after leaving office took another step forward on Friday when a congressional oversight committee requested the materials from the National Archives. The letter to the archivist, from the House committee on oversight and reform, requests the content of the documents taken by Trump to Mar-a-Lago, his residence in Florida. They also asked for any records that the former US president attempted to destroy, and communications on the issue by Trump’s White House aides. They also sought documents “relating to White House employees or contractors finding paper in a toilet in the White House, including the White House residence”. Last week, the archivist confirmed that classified information was taken by Trump to his Florida home and that some records were torn up and taped back together. Staff in the White House also found pieces of torn-up documents clogging the toilet and believed that Trump had attempted to flush them, according to a new book. In total, the National Archives recovered 15 boxes of documents from Mar-a-Lago that should have been turned over when Trump left the White House. The boxes include mementos, gifts, letters and other correspondence, including missives from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, which Trump once described as “love letters,” and a letter left for Trump by his predecessor Barack Obama, the Washington Post has reported. The information is needed to “investigate the full extent of this conduct and determine what additional steps, including potential legislative reforms, may be needed to ensure the preservation of presidential records for the American people,” Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat who chairs the oversight committee, wrote in the letter, according to the Associated Press. Under the Presidential Records Act, all documents and records related to official presidential business must be turned over to the archives. Democrats have accused Trump of repeatedly flouting this law. The twice-impeached former president has denied any wrongdoing, however, and has said that the National Archives “were given, upon request, presidential records in an ordinary and routine process.” David Ferriero, the national archivist, has stated that “some White House staff conducted official business using nonofficial electronic messaging accounts that were not copied or forwarded into their official electronic messaging accounts.” Some of those records are now being sought by the archives. Trump, who made Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified documents a central theme of his successful 2016 presidential election campaign, refused to concede defeat for a lengthy period after losing to Joe Biden in 2020, leading to a rushed packing process when he finally left the White House.",News/US news,House committee requests White House records recovered from Trump’s home,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/25/trump-national-archives-documents-florida-mar-a-lago
2/26/2022,"When Elen Maggs’s oven broke down on 23 December, she definitely didn’t feel happy. “December had been a terrible month already,” said the manager for the high-street retailer Timpson. “I’d totalled the car and had Covid. “Now, not only was I going to be without a cooker over Christmas, but paying for a new one was going to mean dipping into the wedding savings that my partner and I were working hard to build up,” she said. Maggs bemoaned the catastrophe with her colleagues on their group WhatsApp. Without her knowledge, they called Timpson’s director of happiness. A few days later, a new oven was delivered – paid for by the company. “You hear of nice things happening to other people but you never think they are going to happen to you,” said Maggs. “But it’s not just these big things: having a director of happiness makes a massive difference to every minute of my working life.” One of London’s oldest City law firms hit the headlines earlier this week when it discussed hiring a chief happiness officer. The role would, they argued, ensure that staff enjoy “the most vibrant, happy and uplifting place to work in the world” by, among other things, organising micro-retreats for staff and sending them books by their favourite authors. These personal touches aren’t expandable “nice to haves”, said Janet Leighton, Timpson’s director of happiness, but are the result of evidence-based, positive psychological research that yield concrete results. “It’s a commercial no-brainer,” she said. “If people feel supported and cared for, they are calm, relaxed and hardworking. They’re considerate towards each other and towards customers.” The role of happiness officer is becoming increasingly high profile: the first formal position that Prince Harry accepted after stepping down from the royal family was as chief impact officer at BetterUp, a Silicon Valley startup, to help clients with their “personal development”. But the UK is quietly embracing the role too. The UK-based Happy Coffee Consulting company has trained hundreds of budding happiness officers over the past few years through its certified chief happiness officer training. “Companies spend a lot of time and effort trying to make employees happy or engaged by investing in perks, bonuses, free fruit, free coffee, ‘enforced’ fun, free smoothies, etc. But these things do not make people happy at work,” said Sarah Metcalfe, the chief happiness officer at Happy Coffee Consulting. “Happiness at work comes from doing great work together with great people,” she said. “This might sound fluffy, but trained specialists have evidence-based frameworks and programmes that precisely define how each company can achieve this.” Andrew Mawson, the founder of the management consultants Advanced Workplace Associates, believes the role is so important that he recommends all his clients introduce it. The position is, he said, worthy of a high-ranking placement within the company: happiness officers should sit on boards alongside CEOs and have far-reaching powers. “A company of 20,000 people has 20,000 different brains,” he said. “If you want all those brains to be at the top of their game, their teams need to be cohesive and connected. Working well together is the fundamental platform for business success: it gives you a massive competitive advantage.” Happiness officers will become more common, he believes. “There’s a ‘people versus the bosses’ thing going on in many companies at the moment,” he said. “The people will have to win because employees are going to vote with their feet in the end.” Katina Byford-Winter is the office and employee wellbeing manager at Magenta Associates where she organises chats between employees and line managers every three months to discuss career progression, quarterly team outings and annual mini-breaks. She also has a monthly, hour-long mental health “walk-and-talk” with every member of the company, including the founder and CEO. Last week, Craig Peters, a consultant at Magenta, had his monthly meeting with Byford-Winter. “The work Katina does makes me way more efficient and effective as an employee,” said Peters. “My head is clear and calm when I come into work because of her, and I pay back the support she gives me with 100% loyalty to the company.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘Commercial no-brainer’: why role of happiness officer is taking off ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/25/commercial-no-brainer-why-role-of-happiness-officer-is-taking-off
2/26/2022,"The London-listed Russian steel and mining business Evraz has given investors a $1.55bn (£1.2bn) dividend, worth approximately $450m to its shareholder Roman Abramovich, but warned profits could be affected by economic sanctions aimed at the Kremlin and its allies. The company reported a 45% rise revenues to $14.1bn in 2021, primarily from the sale of steel but also from coal, while pre-tax profit more than trebled from $1.3bn to $4.2bn. The result was founded on rising prices, amid soaring demand for steel as the global economy rebounds from the impact of Covid-19. However, the company, whose operations are largely based in Russia, warned it could suffer the effects if the UK, US and Europe step up sanctions against Russian entities in response to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Evraz has not been included on the list of sanctioned Russian companies, such as the airline Aeroflot and VTB Bank. Speaking on a conference call, at which journalists were not permitted to ask questions, the chief finance officer, Nikolay Ivanov, said it was too soon to say whether the company would be affected by sanctions, including any impact on its lending banks. “Currently, we are analysing the impact of potential sanctions imposed just last night,” he said. “We believe it will not have significant impact on the company.” However, in its annual report, Evraz said “policies adopted by the Russian government” had increased uncertainty and the risk of the imposition of sanctions, which could have an adverse affect on the business. The company has also run a simulation of how sanctions could affect profits, including the potential loss of all exports outside the Russian-influenced Commonwealth of Independent States. It said it could be forced to defer dividends, which would potentially mean a cut in the annual income of the billionaire owner of Chelsea football club, Abramovich, who owns 29% of Evraz. The company gave investors a dividend of $1.55bn this year, of which Abramovich is entitled to just under $450m. Abramovich has not been a target for sanctions. Contacted by the Guardian last week, lawyers for the billionaire said Evraz did not fit the criteria for potential designation for sanctions. They added: “It would be ludicrous to suggest that our client has any responsibility or influence over the behaviour of the Russian state.” Evraz has previously held multiple assets in Ukraine but disposed of them in 2018. Referring to the war in its financial results, the company said: “While there have not been direct impacts on the group to date, the board continues to monitor the situation in Ukraine and the response of international governments.” The Guardian has approached Evraz for further comment.

2/26/2022,"As the UK mops up after the latest round of storms and flooding, insurance is on the minds of many people who have suffered damage to their homes and belongings. If you are among those who have borne the brunt of the gale-force winds and heavy rainfall, what do you need to be aware of before you make a claim and who can assist you during the claims process? When insurers assess a claim for storm damage or flooding, they take into account the prevailing wind and rain conditions in your location when the damage occurred. “They will look at what the weather conditions were at the local weather centre nearest the property,” says Malcolm Tarling, a spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers (ABI). Most specify what they will consider a storm, and your policy should outline the criteria. He warns that if an insurer can demonstrate that the flooding or storm damage has been caused by the fact that your property has been poorly maintained, your claim could be turned down. “If you know that your roof tiles are loose, if you’ve been worried about that damp patch on your top-floor room for some time and haven’t checked it out, and then if it can be shown that the damage was caused by poor wear and tear, your policy may not offer cover,” Tarling says. “Insurance is not an alternative to a maintenance contract.” However, he thinks “in most cases” insurers will find it difficult to prove that damage that occurred during Storm Dudley, Storm Eunice and Storm Franklin was caused by poor maintenance or wear and tear, especially if a neighbour’s home has been similarly affected. “I don’t think any insurer, if you make a claim for wind damage over the last few days, is going to say: ‘Hmm, I’m not sure if there was a storm or gale-force winds.’ Because, obviously, quite clearly, there were,” he says. For flooding, the rules are less prescriptive. “A heavy shower or a thunderstorm can cause flooding,” Tarling says. Damage to fences, hedges and gates is not typically covered by home insurance policies. Sheds and outbuildings, such as greenhouses, might not be. “Exclusions will vary, though, so check your policy wording carefully to see exactly what is and isn’t covered,” says Chris King, the head of home insurance at Comparethemarket.com. Typically, he says, your home insurance policy will cover the following problems resulting from hail, wind, snow or ice: roof damage, water damage, sewer backup, frozen pipes and fallen trees, if they damage your home. “Avoid moving or clearing up debris before you’ve taken photos of the damage to support your insurance claim. Where the damage is extensive, your home insurance provider will probably send someone out to assess the situation,” King says. The average amount spent on repairs is £3,500, he says. If the storms have made your home completely uninhabitable, you should expect your insurer to sort out and pay for the cost of alternative accommodation. Tarling says insurers’ call centres are busier than usual now, so if you feel confident starting off your claim online, this might be worth doing. “Insurers will be prioritising their vulnerable and older customers,” he added. The National Flood Forum is a charity set up by people at risk of flooding. The chief executive, Paul Cobbing, says it helps those who have been flooded, with things such as “insurance problems, where to get accommodation and for people who are not insured, how to deal with flooding and dry out your home.” The poorest victims of flooding often do not have insurance or the means to get back on their feet and deal with the damage that has occurred, he says. Calls to the charity helpline (01299 403 055) last 30 to 40 minutes on average, he says. “Very often, it’s emotional support because we understand about flooding – and we understand the things that people go through.” Often people who call need practical help, too: “They’ve lost all their insurance details, they don’t know where to begin or even how to get through to the next day.” It can also provide help to callers who have made an insurance claim but are struggling to get a resolution from their insurer. “We can guide them who to contact, how to make sure things progress and complain if need be,” Cobbing. Sometimes people find they are underinsured because they have not bought enough cover to meet the full expenses of their claim. Others experience problems with contractors or are offered cash or property protection measures by their insurer and don’t know whether to accept them. “We can guide people on all of that,” he says. The average flood insurance claim can easily run into tens of thousands of pounds and is typically about £30,000, according to the ABI. In the past, owners of homes known to be at risk of flooding struggled to get insurance or saw their premiums rise dramatically after a claim to the point that they became unaffordable. However, a government-backed scheme called Flood Re has been put in place to address this. Under this scheme, insurers will offer owners of homes at high risk of flooding cover for flood damage where the premiums are fixed and linked to the council tax band. Homes in the UK that were built and which had a council tax band prior to 2009 usually qualify. “A lot of people haven’t got insurance against flooding because they’ve tried in the past and been refused,” Cobbing says. He urges people in this situation to try getting insurance via the Flood Re website or to contact the National Flood Forum. “We can give people details of the companies that are listed on Flood Re, or if a specialist insurer is needed, we can guide people through to those.” Check the long-term flood risk of your postcode on the government website and sign up for flood warnings. It is also worth asking your insurer what you can do to reduce your risk of being flooded. “They will know from their records whether you’re at risk or not,” the ABI’s Tarling says. He thinks property owners should be wary of acting on advice from flood management agents, without talking to their insurers. “They can suggest you fit all these expensive gadgets and adaptations and then your insurer can turn around and say: ‘If there is a flood, we’re not going to repair to that standard.’” Always speak to your insurer first, to find out what they suggest, before you spend any money on measures that aim to reduce your home’s flood risk in the future.",Lifestyle/Money,UK storm damage: how to make an insurance claim and who can help,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/25/uk-storm-damage-insurance-claim-help-eunice-franklin-flooding
2/26/2022,"As Russian troops pushed into Ukraine on Thursday, viewers of the RT news channel learned a new vocabulary. Rather than an invasion, the Russian actions were described on air as a “special military operation”. Instead of seizing territory from another nation, viewers were told that troops were trying to “liberate” land from Ukraine on behalf of two Russian-backed breakaway states. And if there was any doubt about the justification used by Vladimir Putin for his war, then RT’s British presenter Rory Suchet – the son of the former ITN journalist John Suchet – explained to viewers that the objective was “to defend the Donbas” in the face of Ukrainian aggression. The Kremlin-funded rolling news channel, which has long delighted in its own pariah status, has again come under intense scrutiny in the UK for its willingness to follow the narrative of the Russian government. The Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, demanded RT’s broadcast licence be revoked, telling the House of Commons the organisation once known as Russia Today was Putin’s “personal propaganda tool”. He added: “I can see no reason why it should be allowed to continue to broadcast in this country.” However, this has also raised concerns about opening up a tit-for-tat media expulsion battle with Russia, which last year kicked out the BBC’s Russia correspondent Sarah Rainsford. “There is too much focus on the television channel – its impact is minimal,” said Prof Stephen Hutchings of the University of Manchester, who is writing a book on Russian media that focuses on RT. “The television channel almost has symbolic value. They can’t claim to be an international broadcaster on a par with CNN and BBC without a television channel. But really their most impactful output is online and on social media and YouTube.” The media regulator, Ofcom, which in extreme circumstances can revoke the licences of television channels, is actively monitoring RT’s output for potential breaches of the broadcasting code. But there is no ban on partisan current affairs broadcasting in the UK, as long viewers are also exposed to some alternative viewpoints – the same rule that allows a channel such as GB News to broadcast with a rightwing slant. The Ofcom chief executive, Melanie Dawes, made clear this week that while RT could not broadcast “one-sided propaganda” on Ukraine, it was “acceptable for broadcasters to present issues from a particular perspective provided that alternative views and opinions are also represented”. It was RT’s failure to meet this standard in its coverage of the Salisbury poisonings that led to RT being fined £200,000 by Ofcom in 2019 – but deciding where to draw the line is an art rather than a science. The regulator also takes into account viewer expectations of a channel when considering how to enforce its rules – essentially making the assumption that if you are watching RT then you are expecting to see a strong pro-Russian viewpoint reflected in its coverage. There are also bigger forces at play. The expectation is that if RT is taken off air in the UK, then the BBC’s Russian services will be quickly binned by the Kremlin – the same fate that befell the German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle when the German media regulator took RT off air earlier this month. In any eventuality, there would be nothing to stop RT continuing to produce online content for a British audience, free from regulation, while claiming to have been silenced. This has led to BBC sources raising concerns that removing RT’s broadcast licence would be unhelpful, given how few viewers RT has in the UK. The channel took the unusual decision to pull out of the Barb audience rating system in late 2019. However, RT’s final viewing figures suggested it was only reaching about 79,000 Britons a day and the average viewer watched for less than a minute – giving it an audience comparable with an obscure satellite film channel. It has increasingly become a pariah outlet that struggles to book mainstream politicians and guests. The former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond, who has hosted a show on RT since 2017, this week said he would stop making the programme “until peace is re-established”. Hutchings said his research found RT often carried more diverse viewpoints than its critics acknowledged – but that this changed at moments of crisis. “When Russia’s interests are perceived to be at stake everyone comes behind the central approved narrative. A small group of elite media executives meet with the Kremlin on a weekly basis and they agree the broad agenda and then that’s fed down to the head of news who will translate that into a set of narratives.” He said that while the “Kremlin is determining the narrative” of RT, if Ofcom suspended the channel’s British broadcast licence due to political pressure then it could be counterproductive. “It’s playing the Russian game. We are a society that claims to follow due process.”",News/Media,RT news channel in spotlight in UK over pro-Russia slant on Ukraine crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/25/rt-news-channel-uk-pro-russia-slant-ukraine-crisis
2/26/2022,"The university library in Mosul, which was bombed by Islamic State militants, has opened its doors again, describing itself as a “lighthouse of knowledge” which is “once again burning bright”. Founded in 1921, the library was ransacked and bombarded by missiles during the IS occupation of the city, with an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 books and manuscripts destroyed. It was reopened on 19 February by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with financial support from Germany and book donations from around the world, including over 20,000 from the UK. The university library said the slogan written on the wall by its entrance, “The Word ‘Impossible’ Does Not Exist In Our Dictionary”, was “a symbol of triumph of humanitarianism, civilisation and peace over terrorism”. “This is an extraordinary moment in the history of our city,” said Dr Sayf Al Ashqar, the university’s secretary general of libraries. “The library’s reopening is not just important to the students – but to all of us who lived through that terrible time. It is a symbol of new beginning and we would like to thank everyone who made it possible.” More than 20,000 higher education books were provided for the reopening by UK charity Book Aid International, donated by publishers. The charity first began to support the library after it was approached by Mosul University professor and founder of the Mosul Book Bridge project, Dr Alaa Hamdon. ““I have always believed that libraries are lighthouses of knowledge – providing a beacon for those who value learning,” said Hamdon. “IS extinguished that light for a time, but now our lighthouse is once again burning bright. Libraries can only thrive when they are full of inspiring, wonderful books.” Book Aid intends to provide thousands of additional new titles to the library in the future. “There are few places in the world which have suffered a more direct attack on learning than Mosul, and we are incredibly proud to have played a small role in restoring the book collection which was destroyed at the University of Mosul library,” said chief executive Alison Tweed. UNDP resident representative in Iraq, Zena Ali Ahmad, said the reopening was “an important milestone in the journey to revitalising this iconic city”. “Due to the city’s historical importance and devastating destruction under Isil, UNDP prioritised its stabilisation and rebuilding efforts in Mosul,” said Ahmad. “I am proud that today, the number of students at the University has surpassed enrolment rates before Isil occupation by over 40%.

2/26/2022,"Expensive glamping sites and luxury lodge parks in the Yorkshire Dales are pushing out less affluent national park visitors who just want to pitch up in a tent. John Amsden, the chair of Richmondshire district council’s planning committee, said they were popping up all over the Dales and there was little that could be done to stop them. “Camping sites have changed from being camping sites – they are more like holiday parks,” he said. “Plus we’re getting a lot more sites with pods and lodges.” Amsden said because the pandemic had led to so many people holidaying in the UK there had been large increase in applications for lodges and glamping sites. All of which was “pushing out” people who either can’t afford to glamp, or don’t want to. “There used to be quite a few tent sites in the Dales but they’ve disappeared because of things like this. It is important for the younger generation. My daughter goes camping because it’s easy and it’s not expensive.” He said planners’ hands were tied and they were often powerless to refuse permission for the sites. Amsden said that lodges and pods were expensive structures to put up and applicants were only catering to demand. But will the demand continue? “I’m concerned we’ll get all these places up and running but in three or four years’ time, as things change back to normal and people start going abroad again, they will have priced themselves out of the market. I can see them in five years’ time becoming derelict.” Amsden is a member of the Yorkshire Dales national park planning committee, where the issue was raised this week. It was debated as the committee agreed enforcement action against a Dales camp accused of unauthorised changes, including removing space for tents. Bainbridge Ings, a long-established camping and caravan site at Hawes, had a complex planning history, planning officials said. A quarter of the site was meant to be for tents only and an application to change that to allow caravans and mobile homes had been refused. A subsequent appeal was turned down by the planning inspectorate because of the adverse visual impact. The committee examined aerial photographs from the last year showing the owner had put in tracks and hard standings for mobile homes and caravans in the tent-only field. “I was there this morning to see if anything had changed. It hadn’t,” said Ian Faircloth, planning enforcement officer. “There are still camper vans and motorhomes there. Rather interestingly, the only thing you won’t find in this area are any tents. There is a sign that reads ‘no tents allowed on site’.” Richard Good, a committee member, said he had camped at the site on numerous occasions – “in a tent”. He added: “The lack of actual tent camping in the area is becoming a serious problem. There is a definite need for camping in tents, it is much more economic. The reason why they don’t want tents is because they don’t get anything like the income from tents.” Another committee member, Yvonne Peacock, said she could remember people bringing tents to the site and it being well-used, adding: “Bringing tents is a cheaper way for people to come and enjoy the Dales.” She accused the campsite owners of “trying to make a mockery of our planning system”.

2/26/2022,"Humour, anthropology and psychoanalytic theory may not be natural bedfellows, but the artist Dan Graham spent more than 50 years utilising all three in a prodigious career that encompassed photography, video, performance and sculpture and strayed into architecture, astrology and music criticism. In 1966, Graham, who has died aged 79, was travelling on a train from Manhattan to New Jersey when he saw a subtle pattern emerge in the otherwise identikit new housing springing up along the line. The artist’s subsequent photographs of these “tract housing” developments appeared in an issue of Art News magazine under the headline Homes for America, alongside an essay describing an apparent mathematical formula the artist could discern in the architecture. “Anarchistic humour is very important to my work,” Graham said in 2009. Homes for America was “pure deadpan humour”, he said. “It’s a fake think piece.” The images were “trying to make Donald Judds in photographs”, he explained, referring to the American minimalist known for his use of repetition and serialisation. The pictures were later shown in various galleries and museums, complete with the written commentary. The artist became best known for his pavilions, structures of mirror, glass and steel, often curved in labyrinthine spirals, which mimicked the cool aesthetic of modern architecture. The mirrors, Graham said, referenced the psychiatrist Jacques Lacan’s idea of the mirror stage in childhood development. Indeed, many were designed for children: Girl’s Make-up Room (1998-2000) and Children’s Day Care, CD-Rom, Cartoon and Computer Screen Library (1997-2000) provided space for the activities described in their titles. “The origin of my pavilions dates to the time when I first saw minimal art installed as outdoor public sculpture. It looked so stupid. I wondered how you could deal with putting a quasi-minimal object outside, and also wondered how these things could be entered into and seen from both inside and outside.” He also termed them “fun houses”, accessible to the whole family. Some have become permanent fixtures: at the Hayward Gallery in the Southbank Centre, London, one is used as an education space, and at the KW Institute in Berlin, Graham designed the arts centre’s cafe. “My early photographs of people’s houses in suburbia, the family situation is also very important. Maybe it was because of my unhappy childhood but I was very conscious of the family … I was an alienated child.” He was born Daniel Ginsberg to a Jewish family in Urbana, Illinois. Two years later his father, Emanuel Ginsberg, an organic chemist, changed his name to David E Graham after antisemitism blocked various employment opportunities. The whole family followed suit. Dan described his father as abusive and his mother, Bess, an educational psychologist, as “cold and very intellectual”. Graham suffered from what he described as “almost a schizophrenic breakdown” aged 13, which resulted in him being administered antipsychotic drugs. “All artists have a special relationship with their mother,” Graham said. “My mother was in denial of the body, and my work became about the body.” Miserable at school, aged 14 Graham turned to reading, starting with science fiction and moving on to Jean-Paul Sartre, Walter Benjamin and the anthropologist Margaret Mead. In 1961 he started spending most of his time at a friend’s house in Manhattan and, aged 23, he joined two others “who wanted to social climb”, and opened an art gallery on Madison Avenue. The John Daniels Gallery lasted less than a year, and lost the founders money, but staged Sol LeWitt’s first solo exhibition as well as group shows featuring Judd, Dan Flavin and Robert Smithson. Forced to live back at his parents’, paying off the debts through writing essays and articles on his peers, as well as subjects including the television persona of the entertainer Dean Martin and the paintings of President Dwight Eisenhower, Graham started creating his own art in 1966. One early work, Schema, consists of a series of A4 sheets summarising the texts Graham had published by word count, number of nouns and adjectives, percentage of the page covered by text, and other such statistics. His first solo exhibition took place at the John Gibson Gallery, New York, in 1969; the following year he was invited to Canada to teach at the Nova Scotia School of Design in Halifax. “I had no money. I never had any money in my life, and I wanted to make film and video … they had equipment.” Featuring his students, Graham’s 1972 performance work Two Consciousness Projections(s) sees a woman sitting in front of a television that relays her own image, a live stream from the camera being operated by a man who is standing behind the monitor. Speaking at once, the woman is tasked with describing her mind while the man only narrates the scene he can see through the lens of his camera. “The man was like an old Freudian analyst, like Sigmund Freud, who thought the idea was the man knows everything,” Graham said. “And the woman is just a subject. [The audience], eventually they identify with the woman, because obviously, she was able to talk about herself.” Mirrors first entered his work three years later with Performer/Audience/Mirror, also made in Halifax, in which a man describes his reflection in excruciating detail before an audience. Public Space/Two Audiences, produced for the 1976 Venice Biennale (the first of three times that he participated), divided a gallery into two parts with a soundproofed glass partition, with a mirror on the far wall, so that each group could silently view the other as well as their own reflection. His interest in art was “a hobby” he said, but he was deadly serious on other subjects, most notably rock music and astrology. His 55:27-minute film Rock My Religion (1982-84), made up of collaged found footage, posits gig-going as an ecstatic religious experience: “While individual rock heroes (singers) are unrepentant sinners, the rock group is more like a self-sufficient commune,” the narrator intones at one point. For the 2006 Whitney Biennial he collaborated with the artists Tony Oursler and Rodney Graham on Don’t Trust Anyone Over 30, a rock opera puppet show. Sometimes refusing to work with people if their star sign did not suit, Graham wrote an occasional column on the horoscopes of famous architects for Domus magazine. His work was shown at the Documenta festival in Kassel, Germany, five times from 1972 onwards and was the subject of a travelling retrospective, which opened at the Whitney Museum in New York in 2009. His first public pavilion was commissioned for the Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago in 1978 with over 50 more following, including Turner Contemporary in Margate in 2013, and in the courtyard of the Lisson Gallery in London in 2018. He is survived by his partner, the artist Mieko Meguro, and a brother, Andy.

2/26/2022,"Kiev or Kyiv? As Russian forces menace the Ukrainian capital and thousands flee, the very least onlookers around the world can do is learn how to say the name of the city under siege. The short answer is simple: Ukrainians call their capital “Kyiv” (kee-yiv), the spelling, a transliteration of the Ukrainian Київ. The Russian version is “Kiev” (kee-yev). The latter, based on transliteration from the Russian cyrillic Киев, became the internationally accepted name through the Soviet period and into the first years of this century. There was even a supermarket ready meal named after it. But it is now associated with the Russification of Ukraine, and in recent years more and more publications, governments, airports and geographical dictionaries have switched the spelling to the Ukrainian variant. “When I meet someone new, I like to pronounce their name the way they want it pronounced in their language, which is why I think it’s right to pronounce it ‘Kyiv’ as close to the Ukrainian as possible,” said Andrii Smytsniuk, Ukrainian language teacher at Cambridge University. “Many Ukrainians see this as a sign of respect for their language and identity.” The reason for the difference between the two is bound up in centuries of linguistic evolution in a region that has fallen under Mongol, Lithuanian, Polish and Russian empires over the past 1,000 years. Russian and Ukrainian are both east Slavonic languages (as opposed to west Slavonic languages such as Polish, and south Slavonic ones like Bulgarian). “They all come from an original root, but diverged in the ways that languages do,” says Monica White, associate professor in Russian and Slavonic studies at Nottingham University. Ukrainian took on some Polish influences during the early modern period. Several Ukrainian vowels ended up being pronounced quite differently from their Russian counterparts – not an unusual thing in languages when you think about how the word “time” is pronounced in Melbourne, Middlesbrough and Mississippi. There are several letters of the alphabet unique to Ukrainian, for example the ї in Київ, and enough differences in vocabulary to make it hard for Russophones to understand Ukrainians when they speak in their tongue. Not surprisingly, the Ukrainian government mounted a campaign four years ago to secure international approval for the name of its capital city. There is even a popular Twitter hashtag, #KyivNotKiev.",News/World news,"How to pronounce and spell ‘Kyiv’, and why it matters",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/25/how-to-pronounce-and-spell-kyiv-kiev-ukraine-and-why-it-matters
2/26/2022,"The die is cast. Russia has mounted a major assault on a neighbour in pursuit of Vladimir Putin’s claims on the territories of the former Russian empire. But if Russia were to fail badly at this, and suffer an unambiguous setback, that would be exactly the shock the country needed to start the long, hard process of transitioning from a frustrated former imperial power to a normal country that can coexist with Europe. In contrast to other European imperial powers, for Russia the end of empire was postponed. It came not at the end of the first world war, or of the second, but at the end of the cold war. Russia is not the only former colonial power to have complex relations with its former dominions in the wake of imperial retreat. However, even given its late start, it has not travelled as far along the path of post-imperial normalisation as countries such as the United Kingdom, France or Portugal had a quarter-century after the end of empire. Today, Russia sees its relations with its former dominions in the way that France or Britain did in the first few years after their power was curtailed – before they suffered the defeats and setbacks that drove home the new limits of their ability to shape the world beyond their own borders. At the same point in this post-imperial trajectory, Britain had waged a successful campaign against communism in Malaya, but had not yet suffered the humiliating setback of Suez. Russia has achieved success in small wars in Chechnya and Georgia, and projected power more recently in Syria, Kazakhstan and across Africa. Successful military adventurism both close to home and farther afield prolongs Russia’s belief in its power and its right to dominate others. But the first military defeat would have far-reaching consequences. With its control of the information space at home, Russia can spin or explain away political reverses abroad, but not an unarguable military setback that calls into doubt either Russian military power itself or the ability to exercise it unchallenged. It is only this that can constrain Russia’s future ambition to reassert itself as the dominant power across the countries of eastern Europe, which it sees as its birthright. And it is only significant failure that will lead Russia’s leadership eventually to start to reassess its place in the world. Ukraine is unlikely to be able to halt Russia on its own, so it is the duty of the west to help Russia by ensuring its defeat. So far, it has shirked that duty. Even after the US and UK ruled out direct defensive support to Ukraine, it would have been possible to put in place no-fly zones or maritime exclusion zones, or even to deliver a genuine peacekeeping force to Ukraine to match Russia’s promise to send in its own fake “peacekeepers” in the east of the country. But now the invasion has begun, any of these measures would constitute major escalation by western powers. Instead of simply arriving in Ukrainian airspace to protect it, western air forces would have to fight their way in. Having failed to deter Russia in advance, western efforts now seem focused on finding ways to punish it after the fact. But in addition, the US and its European allies must urgently step up efforts to help Ukraine defend itself, providing weapons, supplies and intelligence to assist in stalling the Russian invaders. Providing indirect support to Ukraine in cyberspace and maintaining pressure on Russian interests and operations away from Europe will also help to put pressure on Moscow. For now, Russia’s behaviour is driven by the fact that it is the only country among the 15 former Soviet republics that is unhappy about the fall of the Soviet Union. The other countries took the events of 1991 as a new opportunity – as a chance to regain independence that was lost decades before. Russia is different. It’s the only country with a leader who openly describes the events of 30 years ago as a catastrophe. Many of Russia’s actions against its neighbours stem from an inability to adjust to the idea that Moscow no longer rules over lands beyond its borders. They also stem from Russia’s distinctive ideas about its own status as a “great power” – in a sense that we associate with the 19th century – and of how exactly the cold war came to an end. President Putin has convinced himself that Russia was a joint “winner” of the cold war, and was entitled to share the rewards of victory with the west. President Putin and his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, have pointed to precedents for constructive Russian involvement in European politics that led to periods of extended peace and stability. The problem is that the precedents they choose, the Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the Yalta conference agreements in 1945, are examples of victorious powers in a world war agreeing among themselves how to run the world over the heads of smaller or defeated states. With or without Russia, this template just doesn’t fit with European notions of relations between states in the 21st century. And it completely misses the point that Russia did not emerge victorious from the cold war. This leads directly to another factor augmenting the danger of current Russian behaviour: overconfidence by Putin and his entourage. Putin has had such a long series of wins that he may have started to believe his own propaganda – that Russia can push forward unopposed, and that the weak, decadent west is in rapid and inevitable decline. It may also have led Russia to underestimate the potential for Ukrainian resistance during the invasion and in the event of possible occupation. But it is precisely the way Russia continues to get it wrong that puts at risk the fragile freedoms that Russia’s other former imperial possessions regained just 30 years ago. Because if Putin is to be believed – and so far he has acted on his convictions – Russia will not stop its drive to reconquer its former possessions at Ukraine. What stops Russia, and has done reliably over centuries, is credible military force being present and ready in advance. Dialogue and diplomacy, the first resorts of western statecraft, have been shown to have no impact on a country that is operating on a different plane of reality and in a different century. Russia’s confidence to act against Ukraine stems from the failure of deterrence by the west overall. It is vital that the west relearns what it takes to put up a stop sign for Moscow.

2/26/2022,"There was something curious but telling about the reports of the Miami launch event for Donda 2 this week. They relayed a lot about its visual extravagance, a lot about the technical cock-ups (which at one point caused the artist formerly known as Kanye West to throw down his microphone in anger); a lot about the baleful presence on stage of alleged rapist Marilyn Manson and homophobic rapper DaBaby, and an awful lot about the lyrical barbs aimed at his estranged wife Kim Kardashian West and her new boyfriend Pete Davidson. But the one thing you didn’t hear much about was the music. You could say that’s a damning indictment of the media’s quest for headline-grabbing sensation rather than the thing that made the artist now known as Ye famous in the first place. Then again, listening to Donda 2 – which features Soulja Boy, Don Toliver and the late XXXTentacion, who have all been accused of domestic abuse – you do wonder if there’s much more to say about its contents. It’s an album on which the interest largely lies in the barbs, and – at a push – working out where your sympathy lies. “No hard feelings,” he offers on True Love – in the spirit of someone prefacing something incredibly rude with a nugatory “I don’t mean to be rude but …” – before accusing Kardashian West of everything from parental neglect to lying to dressing their children incorrectly. He sounds genuinely anguished, but the sound of a 44-year-old man whining because he’s spotted his children wearing a different make of trainer to his own brand is pretty unedifying. So is Security, the track on which he bullishly calls Davidson out for a fight: you can hear something similar in any number of pub car parks after closing time without needing to buy the £200 Stem Player on which Ye is exclusively releasing the album. The infuriating thing about Donda 2 – named, like its predecessor, for Ye’s late mother, who this time doesn’t feature in the lyrics at all – is that you end up focusing on this stuff despite yourself, because the music isn’t particularly interesting. There are moments where it fitfully sparks, where you get a brief flash of the authentically brilliant producer Ye can be: the ragged, off-key use of a sample from Talking Heads’ Burning Down the House on Keep It Burning; the way a sudden burst of electronic tones rushes out of the pattering rhythm track of Too Easy. It’s nice to hear him paying homage to the house music of his Chicago home town with a snatch of Marshall Jefferson’s Move Your Body on Flowers – you just wish it hadn’t been attached to another peevish whinge on which he bafflingly takes credit for Kardashian West’s global fame. Far more often, the tracks feel vaporous, based around mournful, see-sawing synth patterns. True Love does everything it has to do within 90 seconds – mournful synth; mournful XXXTentacion sample; protracted whinge about Kardashian West – but it’s only halfway through: you get a lot more mournful synth for your money. The a cappella, Auto-Tuned Get Lost stretches a six-note melody out for what feels like months. Lord Lift Me Up starts out promisingly, with a huge orchestral sample, but gradually unravels into aimless meandering. The Netflix documentary Jeen-Yuhs opened with a scene from 2020 in which Ye appeared to be simultaneously recording a vocal, planning his doomed presidential bid and petulantly tweeting something unwise against the advice of cooler heads. It may suggest the artist’s polymathic genius or his self-sabotaging erraticism: either way, it’s hard not to think that he may not be the multitasker he thinks he is; if Donda 2 might not have benefited from more focus. It occasionally feels demo-like, half-finished: the corroded electronics on Louie Bags are intriguing, but the song features what sounds like a placeholder vocal. Great lines are few and far between. Selfish’s “even friends got an E-N-D at the end” is smartly done, and Ye’s repeated bark of “Do I look happy to you?” on Happy has an disturbing edge, but there’s no mistaking the surge in energy when Quavo and Offset of Migos appear, trading lines on We Did It Kid. “Make a choice – oxygen or wifi,” he snaps on Sci-Fi, a line apparently admonishing the public for their prurient interest in his private life. If that’s what it’s supposed to mean, it’s a spectacularly disingenuous thing to say in the middle of Donda 2, which hinges on the public’s prurient interest in Ye’s private life and frequently feels less like an album than an accompaniment, something that will burble away in the background while you busy yourself gawping at the circus on social media. Perhaps that’s exactly what it’s meant to be,.
