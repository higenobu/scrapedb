2/10/2022,"Maltese snowboarder Jenise Spiteri competed in Wednesday's women's halfpipe qualifications. After one of her runs, the 29-year-old pulled a dumpling out of her pocket for a mid-competition snack. ""It's like my favorite food that we have in the village,"" Spiteri told USA Today after the event. Malta's lone athlete at this winter's Olympic Games took her first run during the women's snowboard halfpipe qualification event in Beijing. And when she reached the bottom of the slope, she treated herself to a mid-competition snack. Freestyle snowboarder Jenise Spiteri — who is representing the Mediterranean island nation despite her status as a California native — pulled a bao bun out of her pocket and popped it into her mouth while waiting for her scores at Genting Snow Park. NBC caught the funny, candid moment and broadcast it on live television. —On Her Turf (@OnHerTurf) February 9, 2022 The 29-year-old explained to USA Today's Lori Nickel that she struggled to eat breakfast ahead of her Olympic debut. After eating two of the dumplings, which she calls her ""favorite food that we have in the village,"" Spiteri stuffed a pair into her jacket and forgot about them. ""When I was like strapping into dropping for that second run, I was like, 'Oh my God, my dumpling is in my pocket,'"" Spiteri said. Spiteri fell while attempting a backside 720, and she decided that taking ""a little bite"" might ""help soften the blow of falling on that run."" ""I kind of just gave it too much juice and came around to like 747 instead of 720 and couldn't hang on,"" Spiteri added. ""But I usually really like doing that trick because not really many girls do back sevens."" Spiteri did not wind up qualifying for Thursday's halfpipe final. But the opportunity to represent the country her father and grandfather once called home — as their first snowboarder, no less — was really what her trip to Beijing was all about. ""I'm really proud of my Maltese heritage,"" Spiteri told USA Today. ""Growing up in San Francisco, I really grew up as a Maltese American. We were very involved in a Maltese social club, we'd go to events."" ""I've always felt as Maltese as I am American, and so to represent Malta and be their first snowboarder is really special to me.""

 Former President Trump slammed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday after the top Senate Republican criticized the Republican National Committee's (RNC) censure of Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) and Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) and its characterization of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot as ""legitimate political discourse."" ""Mitch McConnell does not speak for the Republican Party, and does not represent the views of the vast majority of its voters. He did nothing to fight for his constituents and stop the most fraudulent election in American history,"" Trump said in a statement, resurfacing his baseless claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him. ""If Mitch would have fought for the election, like the Democrats would have if in the same position, we would not be discussing any of the above today, and our Country would be STRONG and PROUD instead of weak and embarrassed,"" Trump added. Trump has frequently attacked McConnell for acknowledging President Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2020 election and rejecting the former president's claims that widespread fraud tainted the outcome of the vote. His latest remarks came a day after McConnell pushed back against the RNC's censure of Cheney and Kinzinger for their roles on the select committee investigating the Capitol riot. McConnell also criticized the party's censure resolution for apparently referring to the attack on the Capitol as ""legitimate political discourse."" ""We saw it happen,"" McConnell said. ""It was a violent insurrection for the purpose of trying to prevent the peaceful transfer of power after a legitimately certified election, from one administration to the next. That's what it was."" RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel has rejected the notion that the resolution's inclusion of the phrase ""legitimate political discourse"" referred to those who committed acts of violence during the Jan. 6 riot. Rather, she has argued that it was intended to refer to those who engaged in peaceful protests. In a op-ed published on the conservative website Townhall on Tuesday, McDaniel noted that she has ""repeatedly condemned the violence that occurred at the Capitol on January 6th"" and blamed the news media for misconstruing the text of the censure resolution. ""If corporate news media wants to know why Americans don't trust it anymore, they should look no further than the shameful, outrageous, and patently false coverage of the resolution adopted by the RNC to censure Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger,"" she wrote. The RNC resolution has divided Republicans on Capitol Hill, with a number of GOP lawmakers, particularly in the Senate, criticizing it. Those critics include Sen. Mitte Romney (R-Utah), who is McDaniel's uncle.",Politics/The Hill,Trump responds to McConnell criticism of RNC censure resolution,https://news.yahoo.com/trump-responds-mcconnell-criticism-rnc-172824555.html

2/10/2022,"A five-bedroom home on the Outer Banks has collapsed into the Atlantic Ocean, according to the National Park Service. Timbers and other construction debris from the house are creating a safety hazard by washing up on beaches miles away, officials said. A photo shared by the park service shows the first floor of the two-story home was flattened in the collapse. It had a market value of $328,900, according to Trulia. “Cape Hatteras National Seashore visitors should use caution when participating in recreational activities on the beach and in the ocean between the villages of Rodanthe and Salvo,” the park said in a news release. “The bulk of the debris is ... located at 24183 Ocean Drive, Rodanthe. However, smaller amounts of debris have been spotted as far south as off-road vehicle (ORV) ramp 23, more than seven miles away.” A cause was not revealed, but many beachfront homes along the Outer Banks are at risk of collapsing due to erosion. Park rangers are working with Dare County officials on a plan to remove what’s left of the home and clean up the debris on beaches, officials said. Trulia reports the home was 1,960 square feet and sat on .25 of an acre. It was built in 1980 as part of the Trade Winds Beaches community, the site reports.
