1/24/2022,"I ran across this tweet last week from venture capitalist Balaji Srinivasan: “Suppose there is a principle. The principle is good, but the proponents are bad. While quoting it endlessly, they distort the principle beyond recognition. In response, the opposition now opposes the principle even in principle. What’s a good term for this common phenomenon?” I would call it a gaslighting feedback-loop. Gaslighting is a colloquialism that was made popular by the movie ""Gaslight"" (1944), in which a husband schemes to make his wife think she’s crazy with a series of lies and dirty tricks so he can get her committed to an asylum and steal her money. Mr. Srinivasan has indeed outlined a common phenomenon in today’s media-soaked culture and politics. So I wondered whether I could find an appropriate cartoon in my archives to illustrate the principle. It didn’t take long. My April 28, 2019, Palm Beach Daily News cartoon about an open-carry activist, disingenuously posing as a fisherman so he could legally parade around public streets with an arsenal, fills the bill. The root issue behind the cartoon is the Second Amendment that gives Americans the right to bear arms. Many Americans hunt, target-shoot and own guns for security and personal protection. We quibble about some of the risks involved, but most Americans acknowledge and respect the Constitutional right. Despite this, right-wing politicians and gun lobbyists have gaslighted for decades about the Second Amendment being in danger of repeal, and equated the prospect of tightening regulations with government tyranny and loss of freedom. Fear-mongering rhetoric, such as “they’re coming for your guns” escalates every time there’s a public outcry after a mass shooting. Gun rights activists also frequently insist that tighter regulations would unfairly punish good people for what bad people do, and respond with “only a good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun.” Though simplistic and illogical, this grievance has become the rationale for state legislatures proposing radical laws to arm teachers in the classroom and to legalize open-carry possession in public. Of course, you can’t have bifurcated politics without the other side becoming equally strident. Therefore, an increasing number of gun opponents call for banning all handguns or semi-automatic weapons or, yes, getting rid of guns altogether. As a result, you get heavily armed guys parading around because they think their Second Amendment rights are threatened. In reality, not everyone has been sucked into this escalating feedback-loop of half-truths, fantasies and fallacies. Most Americans support the Second Amendment but also believe tighter firearms regulations and registration would be a good idea — including a lot of gun owners. Unfortunately, our gaslighting addiction has created a political chasm that apparently can’t be breeched. The public’s gullibility to blatant distortions has tainted many issues and created a breeding ground for con artists in government. It’s time for Americans to recognize the danger of this dynamic and shut off the gas. After all, there are those who love to play with fire.

1/24/2022,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — The U.S. Navy announced Sunday it seized a boat in the Gulf of Oman carrying fertilizer used to make explosives that was caught last year smuggling weapons to Yemen. The British royal navy said it confiscated 1,041 kilograms (2,295 pounds) of illegal drugs in the same waters. The interdictions were just the latest in the volatile waters of the Persian Gulf as American and British authorities step up seizures of contraband during the grinding conflict in Yemen and ongoing drug trafficking in the region. The U.S. Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet said its guided-missile destroyer USS Cole and patrol ships halted and searched the sailboat, a stateless fishing dhow, that was sailing from Iran on a well-worn maritime arms smuggling route to war-ravaged Yemen last Tuesday. U.S. forces found 40 tons of urea fertilizer, known to be a key ingredient in homemade improvised explosive devices, hidden on board. Authorities said the vessel had been previously seized off the coast of Somalia and found last year to be loaded with thousands of assault rifles and rocket launchers, among other weapons. U.N. experts say weapons with such technical characteristics likely come from Iran to support the Houthi rebels. The Navy turned over the vessel, cargo and Yemeni crew to Yemen’s coast guard earlier this week. Yemen is awash with small arms that have been smuggled into the country's poorly controlled ports over years of conflict. Since 2015, Iranian-backed Houthi rebels have been battling a Saudi-led military coalition for control of the nation. Iran says it politically supports the rebels but denies arming them, despite evidence to the contrary. The smuggled weapons have helped the Houthis gain an edge against the Saudi-led coalition in the seven-year war. Violence has drastically escalated over the past week amid stalled international attempts at brokering peace. Following a deadly drone attack claimed by the rebels on Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, Saudi warplanes pounded the northern rebel-held province of Saada, hitting a prison and killing over 80 detainees. Officials also revealed Sunday that a British royal navy vessel had seized a large quantity of illegal drugs valued at some $26 million from a boat sailing through the Gulf of Oman on Jan. 15. The HMS Montrose confiscated 663 kilograms (1,461 pounds) of heroin, 87 kilograms (191 pounds) of methamphetamine and 291 kilograms (641 pounds) of hashish and marijuana, the joint maritime task force said in a statement. The task force did not elaborate on where the drugs came from, who manufactured them or their ultimate destination. But Iran over the last decade has seen an explosion in the use of methamphetamine, known locally as “shisheh” or “glass” in Farsi, which has bled into neighboring countries.",World/Associated Press,"US detains smuggling ship, UK seizes drugs in Mideast waters",https://news.yahoo.com/us-detains-smuggling-ship-uk-090935503.html
