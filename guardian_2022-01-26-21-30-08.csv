1/26/2022,"Glass Animals have become the first British band to top the daily global Spotify streaming charts, with their single Heat Waves currently amassing 4.26m plays a day on the platform. The milestone comes 10 years into the band’s career and their song is the definition of a slow-burn hit: originally released in June 2020, it took until October that year to sneak into the lower reaches of the official UK chart. It finally entered the Top 40 in February 2021, and by October it had made its way into the Top 5.  The breezy, summery song – which blends dream-pop vocals with crisp rap-style production – performed even more highly in the US, reaching No 3 there, where it currently stands. It had the longest climb to the Top 10 in US chart history, at 42 weeks. Heat Waves has a sole songwriter, Dave Bayley, making it the first Spotify chart-topping song since Pharrell’s Happy in 2014 to be written by a single person. Bayley fronts the Oxford-formed quartet, who released their debut EP in 2012. After touring heavily on both sides of the Atlantic, they had their first major success with second album How to Be a Human Being in 2016, which reached the US Top 20 and was nominated for the Mercury prize. Third album Dreamland, which features Heat Waves and was recorded after drummer Joe Seaward recovered from a serious cycling accident, reached No 2 in the UK and No 7 in the US.

1/26/2022,"Also known as pease pottage, or a London particular, depending on which century you hail from, this thick, smoky pea soup is a world away from the silky, vivid green versions of midsummer. Instead, it relies on dried peas, a staple starch of the medieval table before potatoes came along and still cheap as chips, and equally comforting on a winter’s day. Prep 15 min, plus optional overnight soakingCook 3 hr 15 minServes 6  For the ham (or use 1½ litres ham, chicken or vegetable stock, plus some shredded ham)1 smallish smoked ham hock1 onion4 cloves1 celery stick1 carrot1 bay leaf2 sprigs fresh thyme For the soup2 tbsp butter1 onion, peeled and diced1 carrot, peeled and diced500g dried peas (green for preference), whole or split If using whole dried peas, soak them in plenty of cold water overnight. If you can’t find any dried peas in the dried pulses section at the supermarket, you may well have more luck in Asian food stores; British dried peas are available online from Hodmedod’s. If using split ones, simply soak them in cold water while you prepare the ham. If you’re cooking a ham from scratch, put it in a largish pan (start from step 4 if you’re using stock). Wash and cut the onion in half (there’s no need to peel, unless it’s filthy) and stud it with the cloves. Very roughly chop the celery and carrot (wash, but again no need to peel) into a few pieces and add these and the herbs to the pot. Add enough cold water barely to cover the contents of the pan and bring it to a boil. Skim off any froth from the top, turn down the heat and simmer for about two and a half to three hours, until the meat is tender and cooked all the way through (if you have a food thermometer or probe, the internal temperature should be at least 60C). Turn off the heat and leave the ham to cool in the liquid. Drain the ham, reserving the cooking liquid but discarding the vegetables. If you’re using readymade ham stock, start the process from here. Melt the butter in a large pan, add the chopped onion and cook gently for about five minutes, to soften. Add the chopped carrot and cook for another five minutes. Stir in the peas (drained, if you soaked them), stir to to coat in the butter … … then add a litre of the ham stock (if you don’t have enough cooking liquor, make it up with water). Bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and cook until the peas begin to break down – bear in mind that whole peas will take longer to cook than split ones, and may also require more liquid. Meanwhile, strip the ham from the bone and shred (or shred whatever ham you are using). Once the peas have broken down (if using whole peas, once they’re soft, you can use a stick blender or a potato masher to hurry them along), use the remaining stock to thin the soup to your desired consistency, if need be. Stir most of the shredded ham into the soup (depending on the size of your joint, you may well not need it all), season to taste, then serve with a little more ham sprinkled on top. This soup keeps and reheats very well, though you might want to thin it again with water. To make this vegetarian, use vegetable stock instead, and stir a teaspoon of smoked paprika into the pan just before you add the drained peas. I also add a tablespoon of Marmite at the end, dissolved in warm water, to give it some extra savoury oomph, but that’s entirely optional. If you don’t thin the soup and keep it very thick, you can even serve this as a side dish for the sliced ham, rather than as a soup. It’s also very nice with roast or braised pork, or indeed as a side dish in general. Garnish with chopped herbs or spring onions.

1/26/2022,"Writer-director Garth Jennings has returned with a sequel to the highly successful family animation Sing, about a koala called Buster Moon (voiced by Matthew McConaughey, a musical theatre impresario with a never-say-die attitude and a cute troupe of talking, singing animals. That was a slick product with a fair bit of charm, but this follow-up has all of the varnish but the actual heart and soul has dwindled to a blandness. It feels like a screensaver, a movie generated by an algorithm, the same algorithm that calculated the likely profit on extending the Sing franchise. Now Buster and the gang are yearning to make it big in the world’s entertainment capital: a flashy but fictional place called Redshore, like Vegas with a dash of LA. They somehow blag their way into an audition for thuggish media magnate and arctic wolf Jimmy Crystal (Bobby Cannavale) who lets them put on their sci-fi spectacular in his hotel showroom, as long as it stars his pampered princess of a daughter Porsha (voiced by Halsey). Fast-talking Buster also claims he can tempt out of reclusive retirement a legendary singer and lion called Clay Calloway (voiced by Bono) who slightly tiresomely sings his version of I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For, without anyone breaking the fact-fiction dividing wall and wondering why this supposed icon is performing a U2 cover instead of his own material.  The movie runs smoothly on rails, like a fairground ride or a Vegas attraction, although the central plot point – Porsha’s turnaround from being a spoilt brat to a decent and loyal member of Buster’s cast – isn’t satisfyingly explained. This is the kind of movie that could be put on to keep young kids happy … though maybe not so happy as they could have been.

1/26/2022,"Environmental campaigners are fighting to stop a water company being given almost total immunity from any private legal action for discharging untreated sewage into waterways. The Good Law Project (GLP) and the Environmental Law Foundation (ELF) are challenging a decision by the high court that the water company United Utilities cannot be subject to any private legal action for its discharges of raw sewage from storm outfalls into the Manchester ship canal.  The decision made last April is being reviewed by the court of appeal, which this week granted permission for the legal groups to submit evidence as part of the case. Jo Maugham, the director of the GLP, said if United Utilities was to win the case it could end a vital legal option to hold water companies to account for sewage dumping. Lawyers for the GLP say the decision would effectively act as a precedent which all water companies would seek to rely on. The environmental groups will tell the court of appeal it has now become clear that sewage dumping from storm overflows has been occurring with alarming regularity and does not just take place in exceptional circumstances, for instance after very heavy rainfall. Emma Montlake, the joint executive director of the ELF, said: “ELF works with and assists communities across the country plagued by the environmental and health consequences associated with sewage pollution into British water systems. “We are delighted that the court [of appeal] has agreed that the ELF’s evidence and that of others in the consortium will be able to assist the court of appeal to understand the context and wider ramifications of unchecked sewage pollution.” The fight over the rights to sue a water company over discharges from outflows of raw sewage began in 2010 when the owners of the Manchester ship canal sought damages against United Utilities for discharges of sewage into the waterway. MSC argued that water companies did not have a legal right to pollute waterways with raw sewage. They argued that untreated, or inadequately treated, discharge that was unauthorised would be unlawful and therefore could be challenged by legal action. In response United Utilities sought a declaration in court that as a water company it could not be subject to private legal action because it was a matter for the regulator. The high court agreed with the water company and granted the declaration it sought, that there was no case in law against United Utilities in respect of discharges from the company’s outfalls. The judge – in supporting his decision – said discharges were “the effect of sudden heavy rainfall, which causes flooding and results in the capacity of the existing system being exceeded” and had “occurred without United Utilities doing anything to cause it or being able to do anything lawfully to stop it, except by spending money on large-scale capital improvements”. In 2020 water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers and waterways more than 400,000 times over 3.1m hours. A United Utilities spokesperson said: “The legal case you have referenced is not about avoiding accountability, the aim is to clarify the regulatory position regarding wastewater outfalls. This is the latest in a long series of cases brought against United Utilities by the owners of the Manchester ship canal. We cannot comment any further on this as the legal proceedings are ongoing.”",News/Environment,Lawyers challenge water firm’s immunity over sewage discharge,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/26/lawyers-challenge-water-firms-immunity-over-sewage-discharge
1/26/2022,"Fifa and the Confederation of African Football face a test of leadership over whether Sadio Mané plays in Senegal’s Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final, according to the brain injury charity Headway. The Liverpool forward was taken to hospital with a suspected concussion after clashing heads with Cape Verde goalkeeper Vozinha during Senegal’s last-16 win in the Africa Cup of Nations on Tuesday.  Vozinha was sent off for the 53rd-minute foul and received immediate treatment for his head injury. Mané played on after treatment, however, and scored the opening goal of Senegal’s 2-0 win in the 63rd minute. Following a lengthy VAR review of the goal, the 29-year-old dropped to the pitch holding his head and was eventually helped off and substituted in the 70th minute. Mané later posted a picture on social media of himself and Vozinha in hospital with the caption: “Senegal vs Cape Verde in the pitch, in the hospital. Everything is fine, thank you all for the messages.” He should now undergo a graduated return to play, placing his availability for Sunday’s quarter-final against Mali or Equatorial Guinea in doubt. Headway believe it would demonstrate the weakness of football’s protocols on concussion should the Liverpool striker feature. Luke Griggs, the charity’s deputy chief executive, said: “This was a sickening collision that clearly left both players in enough distress for a concussion to have surely been considered a possibility at the very least. At that point, the principle of ‘If in doubt, sit it out’ should have resulted in Mané being substituted without another ball being kicked. “The image of the player collapsing on the ground and having to be helped from the pitch after scoring his goal should tell you everything you need to know about the impact and the effect it had had on his brain. Yet again, the desire to win is seen as being worth serious risks to players’ health. It is simply shocking that this continues to happen. “This is now a real test of leadership for the Confederation of African Football and world governing body Fifa – particularly if Senegal declare Mané fit for Sunday’s quarter-final. If football wants to be taken seriously when it comes to concussion, it simply must take action to enforce and strengthen its protocols.”",Sport/Football,Head injury charity pressures Fifa after Senegal’s Sadio Mané hospitalised,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/26/head-injury-charity-headway-pressures-fifa-after-senegal-sadio-mane-hospitalised-afcon
1/26/2022,"It’s a new year, so it’s time for a new cryptocurrency buzzword to escape the sector and become the latest fad that baffled news anchors try desperately to explain to their increasingly confused audiences before giving up and passing over to the sports desk. In other words: move over “NFT”, now “DAO” is the hot acronym on the block.  Just as NFTs weren’t new this time last year, when the gestalt eye of the internet turned towards them as an investment opportunity after the buzz of pumping and dumping GameStop stock had worn off, so too are DAOs an old idea given a new lease of life by untold millions of consumer cash flooding into the sector. But, I’ve got ahead of myself: what are they, what are their history, and why are we talking about them now? WTF even is a DAO? Standing for “decentralised autonomous organisation”, a DAO isn’t really in the same class as an NFT. Rather than being a singular digital asset, like a picture of a monkey or a dog-themed copy of a dog-themed copy of bitcoin, a DAO is more like a company – but one which is directly controlled by its shareholders, without the need for employees or directors. (Although, we should note, a DAO is Not A Company and owners of DAOs are Not Shareholders, because if it were and they were, the whole thing would be wildly illegal. Glad we’ve cleared that up.) At its platonic ideal, a DAO exists in the realm of code-as-law that much of the cryptocurrency community fetishises. An organisation is set up by some clever bod, who sells membership to anyone who’ll buy its tokens. The cash used to buy the tokens becomes the organisation’s treasury, and it can be used by simply writing a smart contract (to, say, loan some money out at an 8% interest rate) and securing the votes of enough of the organisation’s token-holders, at which point the smart contract is executed. In that idealised vision of the organisation, there barely needs to be any human-level structure at all – hence the “autonomous” part of the name. The DAO itself exists as a smart contract, and while the founder may reserve some special perks for themselves (typically in the form of giving themselves some tokens for free before they go on sale), they have no formalised power beyond the same votes that everyone else has. But in the real world, DAOs have hit two major problems. The first is that coding is hard, and the second is that most things you would actually want to do in the world today still don’t exist on the blockchain. Coding is hard The problem with outsourcing all of your governance to smart contracts is that writing code for cryptocurrency platforms is hard, and reading it is even harder. It’s all very well to be shown a smart contract and told that it will authorise a loan of 8% to a safe counterparty, but it’s trivial to hide nasty surprises in plain sight. Take the story of the “YEAR” token, which was launched on New Year’s Eve. The token had a very simple use, which was to plug into a smart contract that showed owners their activity on the Ethereum blockchain, but it also arrived with a curious bug: what looked like a typo in the aspect of the contract governing buying and selling it, that meant that if you tried to sell the token to the contract owner, it would fail. What happened then was simple. Once the token launched, and gained a bit of word of mouth, the founder transferred its ownership – to the only cryptocurrency exchange where it was listed. That meant, at a stroke, that the token became a honeypot: people could buy it, but couldn’t sell it, and the value went up and up on the exchange as a result. Then, thirty minutes later, the founder drained about £100,000 from the account, and disappeared into the night. That’s a small loss in the grand scheme of things, and “rugpulls” – where a project is launched with great fanfare before its founder steals the funds – are so common in the sector that the phrase is now a one-word term. But a bigger example of the same problem is the failure of a much bigger DAO: in fact, the very first one, called simply TheDAO. Launched in April 2016, TheDAO made all the same promises as those around today, and rapidly gained thousands of investor/members and more than 11m Ether under its control (worth well over $100m then, and $25bn now). But a bug in the foundational code of the project, unfixed since May that year, was exploited on 17 June, to drain 3.6m Ether into another account. The hack was so enormous by the scale of the then nascent Ethereum blockchain that it had ramifications far outside TheDAO and its direct investors. In the end, the entire Ethereum cryptocurrency was rewritten from the ground up to reverse the transactions: the Ethereum in use today is technically a “hard fork” of the original, and some users still cling to “Ethereum Classic”, the blockchain where TheDAO’s hack was allowed to continue existing. Against that background, it is … somewhat odd to me that people continue to describe their projects as DAOs. It seems a bit like deciding that hydrogen airships are the future, despite their historical safety record, and then calling your new business “Hindenburg Aviation”. The blockchain isn’t the world But the cryptocurrency sector of 2022 is a different beast from the one of 2016. Perversely, it feels like the vague chance of losing everything to rugpulls and hacks has become more accepted as the sector has moved toward the mainstream, with consumers embracing cryptocurrency as a high-risk, high-reward way of gambling their savings. These days, the more pertinent flaws of DAOs are becoming apparent as the ambitions of the sector outstrip its ability, with projects such as ConstitutionDAO and theSpiceDAO. We’ve covered the former, a crowdfunded plan to buy a copy of the US constitution, here before (the project ended in chaos after the group was outbid by a Wall Street executive and failed to buy the constitution at all). TheSpiceDAO is the “second as farce” version of the same idea. A DAO built around an auction of a rare book detailing the abortive production of an adaptation of Dune by Chilean director Alejandro Jodorowsky, the community managed to actually buy the book. Unfortunately, it was confused about what it had actually acquired. After spending €2.66m on the book, the group planned to: Make the book public (to the extent permitted by law) Produce an original animated limited series inspired by the book and sell it to a streaming service Support derivative projects from the community In other words, rather than buying a copy of the book, they seemed to believe they had licensed the actual rights to the property. Needless to say, they are not legally entitled to produce an animated series based on Dune. Despite this, the project is steaming ahead. One popular idea has been to mint NFTs, one for each page of the book, and then to burn the book, ensuring that only the NFT owners “really” own the content. It’s a bold move, let’s see if it pays off for them. Where next? I don’t like making predictions (I am, after all, the guy who called bitcoin a bubble when it was worth £30), but I think it’s almost guaranteed that the next few big cryptocurrency stories will be focused on DAOs. The steam has started to run out on NFTs, narrowly construed: the art bubble has stopped growing, the profile pic projects are too easily parodiable, and the gaming-related NFTs are still stumbling on the fact that none of the games that exist are good, fun or exciting in any way. Money will flow in, but mainstream attention is moving on. DAOs, by contrast, can be anything: a project to buy a valuable thing, to build a real asset, to move billions, or just to make a lot of money. And they’re also the perfect vehicle for the newly minted millionaires of the sector to throw their influence into the real world: want to buy and run a football team, get celebrities to act in a movie you’ve written, or just spend a lot of money so people think you’re serious? A DAO is the way you do that. It’s going to be chaos.

1/26/2022,"The England footballers Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard have said they do not condone any form of discrimination, after a photograph emerged of them posing in Dubai with the grime MC Wiley. Wiley is a hugely controversial figure. In 2020 he was banned from Twitter and Facebook for a series of antisemitic posts, including one rant in which he compared Jews with the Ku Klux Klan and described them as snakes.  On Tuesday the Jewish Chronicle published a photograph of Rashford and Lingard, both Manchester United players, posing with Wiley after a performance at a nightclub in Dubai on Sunday. It had been posted on Wiley’s Instagram page and was later deleted. A backlash prompted both players to make statements on antisemitism. Rashford said: “This picture has been brought to my attention which I understand now, given context, could easily be misconstrued. I would like to reinforce that I do not and will not condone discriminative language or behaviour of any kind aimed at the Jewish community or any other community.” A Manchester United-supporting reporter, Ben Bloch, asked what the context was, adding: “All I’m seeing right now is you posing next to a man who hates me and other Jewish people to his core. Please help me understand.” Rashford replied: “Hey Ben, I wasn’t aware of comments that had been made when I got pulled into a photo opportunity. Comments that I absolutely condemn. I apologise for any upset caused. We just all happened to be in the same place at the same time.” The footballer also said: “I truly believe that tackling antisemitism in and outside of the game requires a greater level of attention and should very much form part of the game’s anti-racism stance.” Lingard posted on Twitter: “I’ve been made aware of a photo circulating currently, that can easily be misconstrued. I want to make it clear that I do not condone any form of racism whatsoever!” Wiley, known as the “godfather of grime”, has refused to distance himself from the comments but apologised for “generalising” about Jewish people. He said they came after a falling out with his now former manager, who is Jewish. He told Sky News: “My comments should not have been directed to all Jews or Jewish people. I want to apologise for generalising, and I want to apologise for comments that were looked at as antisemitic.” Wiley was awarded an MBE in 2018 but told the interviewer he would happily give it up as he “never wanted it”.",Arts/Music,Marcus Rashford and Jesse Lingard condemn antisemitism after photo with Wiley,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/26/marcus-rashford-and-jesse-lingard-condemn-antisemitism-after-photo-with-wiley
1/26/2022,"Perhaps it’s a symptom of only communicating over Zoom for two years, but I have noticed a direct correlation between the length of time that people keep you waiting at the start of a meeting and how good a person they are. One minute late? Maybe they’re having technical difficulties. Five minutes? Bit cheeky. Ten? Worse than Satan himself. I’m telling you this because my interview with Michael Schur was due to start at 5pm. But , and I really can’t overstate how rare this is, he clicked online at 4:59. “I like to follow rules, man,” he shrugs when he realises how overjoyed I am at his punctuality.  As the creator of both Parks and Recreation and The Good Place – perhaps the two finest American sitcoms of the last decade – Schur’s love of rules has stood us all in good stead. Parks and Rec centred on Schur’s belief in the positive potential of proactive government. The Good Place, meanwhile, was even more forthright. It was an afterlife comedy, paced like a thriller, that explicitly asked what it meant to be a good person, based on criteria laid out by three millennia of moral philosophers. If the premise sounds dry, the show was wildly entertaining. You could say something similar about Schur’s new book, How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question. It is his attempt to package everything he learned about moral philosophy during the making of The Good Place in as accessible a manner as possible. It’s an absolute breeze to read; funny and enlightening and revealing, despite its potentially heavy subject matter. “Well, that was the impetus for doing it, and the show”, he explains from his home in California. “I realised that this is the most vital writing that’s ever been done by humans, and it’s dense and impenetrable. The way that I started to think of it was like these people were writing recipes for chocolate chip cookies that were delicious and healthy and would help you lose weight, but their recipes were 800 pages long and written in German”. Spending an hour with Schur is an absolute salve. There’s something reassuringly paternal about how reasonable and inquisitive he is, and how unflappable in the face of moral confusion. This appears to be something that those around him revel in, too. “I have friends who send me texts like, ‘Hey, my cousin asked my brother to borrow money and it seems a little unethical’” he says. “People are going through their own moral quandaries, and I’ve become like an amateur expert to them.” I have to confess that I fall prey to this myself during our time together, basically using him as a philosophical fortune-telling machine to help clarify issues I have struggled with. Inevitably, talk quickly turns to Covid. How to Be Perfect touches on the pandemic a handful of times, but Schur admits that it was difficult not to make it the focus of the whole book. “The pandemic is a perfect way to discuss morality”, he says. “Every time you leave your house, you’re being faced with a bunch of moral choices that involve how you interact with other people, how you treat other people, what your responsibilities are, what other people’s responsibilities are at the family level, the local level, the state level, the national level, the international level. It’s pretty wild that it coincided with the book that I was writing about how to make better decisions.” Overwhelmingly, a huge aspect of moral philosophy is understanding that we share the world with other people, and it serves everybody well to be decent, but the pandemic has also revealed hidden reserves of selfishness. Is there a philosophical explanation for not wearing a face mask? “Ayn Rand is extremely popular because she is basically a ‘get out of jail free’ card for morality, right?” begins Schur. “She’s like, ‘No, actually, the more selfish you are the better off you are – and the better off the world is.’ Now, that is a truly and deeply bananas philosophy. It’s bananas on bananas. Yet because it’s so appealing to people who might be inclined to a selfish outlook, they have a moral basis for behaving that way.” One of the issues, he explains, is our woolly definition of freedom. “It’s such an enormous word,” he continues. “There are no checks and balances on the concept of freedom. However, when your freedom impinges upon the health and safety of others, the natural thing would be to find a membrane where the limits of your freedom meet the wellbeing of others. But they’re screaming and yelling about not having to wear a mask in this McDonald’s and beating you over the head with an American flag. All the nuance is lost in those arguments.” It’s hard not to be despondent. “It’s a real gut punch,” he nods. “It’s a daily gut punch that so many people have taken that position, because it just means that the lives of other people are uninteresting to them, and what else do we have? If you don’t care about anyone else, then what are we doing? What are we doing here?” An entire chapter of How to Be Perfect is dedicated to a subject unlikely to have bothered Aristotle: how to separate art from the artist. We live in a world of problematic faves, and we still lack clear consensus on how to work through the ugliness that arises when someone whose work we love does something personally unforgivable. In the book, Schur talks about his lifelong admiration for Woody Allen, even going as far as crediting Sleeper for kickstarting his interest in comedy. (Allen has been accused of sexually assaulting his daughter Dylan in 1992; he denies the allegations, and was was cleared by two subsequent investigations.) Where are you with his work now, I ask. “I think I can still enjoy the old Woody Allen movies that were meaningful to me,” he begins. “I think he’s artistically a genius. But the key is to not hide from the other stuff. When I watch his old movies, they still evoke memories of when I first watched them. But then some part of me is like, ‘Just remember the other stuff.’ It sucks because it means that, instead of enjoying them 100% I’m only enjoying them 74%, but I think the problem is that you can’t either ignore the reality of who the person is, or get rid of the work entirely. You’ve got to land somewhere in the middle.” Having dealt with the bigger issues, I attempt to end the interview by steering back into lighter territory. One running joke in How to Be Perfect is Schur’s dislike for pineapple pizza. So imagine that I invited you to my house and unwittingly serve you Hawaiian pizza. What do you do? Would you eat it? “First of all, thank you for breaking up probably the most important moral question of our times,” Schur laughs. What happens next is roughly the philosophical equivalent of watching Paul McCartney pull Get Back from thin air. “The answer is yes, I would,” he says. “I would 100% eat it, and I wouldn’t say a word about it. I know this to be true because I’m a vegetarian.” Oh God, I cringe, knowing that even in this hypothetical situation, I’ve committed an unforgivable crime. “There have been times in my life where I’ve gone to someone’s home and forgotten to tell them that I’m a vegetarian, and they serve burgers or hot dogs or whatever,” he says. “The shame and the discomfort of saying, ‘Oh, I don’t eat meat,’ puts them in such an unpleasant position, so I never say anything. The importance of me spending this one meal out of all of the meals that I eat in my life as a strict vegetarian does not outweigh the social propriety of accepting the kind offer of a meal created for me by someone else. I don’t feel like I have compromised my entire value system because I had some chicken salad.” At this point I start to feel bad about not asking if he ate meat before serving him an imaginary pizza. “It’s fine,” he reassures me. “The world keeps spinning. Everything’s fine. I mean, afterwards, I’m definitely going to talk shit about you,” he adds. “Because anyone who likes Hawaiian pizza deserves to be talked shit about. Not even in a moral way.
