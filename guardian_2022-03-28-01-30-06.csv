3/28/2022,"This is the sort of crisis we like, one we can revel in, a sporting calamity but no more than that. Lives have not been ruined. No one has died. The options ahead, though hard to unravel, are not terrifying. Three months ago, England’s cricket team was thrashed by a good Australian side and as a consequence the managing director and coach was sacked by the England and Wales Cricket Board’s Red Adair, Andrew Strauss, who belied his reputation for rock-solid pragmatism by sending the side off to the Caribbean without some of their best players – just to see what happened. Now England have lost humiliatingly to West Indies, a moderate, spirited side nowhere near as good as Australia. Something must be done to hasten “the red-ball reset”. Fresh cliches may be required. So we can all leap on our bandwagons. This means I can rail against the myopic structure of English domestic cricket, which has the prime cricketing months of the summer being devoted to two types of short-form cricket. Why should the next generation of cricketers be bothered with this archaic red-ball game? The money is elsewhere. The advent of the Hundred is symbolic of a sleepwalk to decline; it may be a godsend for women’s cricket but the death knell for the men’s game. Others may use England’s demise this winter as confirmation of a county structure that’s not fit for purpose. Why not be radical and abolish them all? Use the Hundred model to create some red-ball franchises in the urban centres and bugger Bognor, or Hove, or Taunton or Chelmsford or Worcester. And what about our battters? They can only score runs on featherbeds and how can they possibly prosper when they never encounter genuine pacemen in county cricket? Except that they have been humiliated this winter by Scott Boland and Kyle Mayers, both of whom display the qualities of the archetypal English seamers, who are just gearing up for action this April? So let’s not pretend there are any simple solutions. There will be calls for more change. Someone else has to go and the only one left in the firing line is captain Joe Root – even though we currently have no idea who has the job of sacking him if he does not walk away of his own accord. More agonising about Root’s captaincy is faintly preposterous since he has been in charge for longer than any other Englishman in history, 64 Tests, of which 27 have been won and 26 lost. After all those Tests you would have thought the debate about Root was over. He is not the worst captain we have ever had. Nor the best. He is a thoroughly decent, well-respected leader, genuinely devoted to the game and, by a terrifying margin, England’s best batter. But that does not mean that he should carry on regardless. He will probably go now; he probably should. It is not all his fault. His side has been about three Test batters short. He has done his time in charge and at the moment it is not working. He could even come back in a few years’ time. Maybe we should view the captaincy differently. In recent times it has become a presidential term. With a few failed interlopers, the England captaincy has passed from Atherton to Hussain to Vaughan to Strauss to Cook and then to Root in roughly four-year cycles as if it is the holy grail, which dare not be disturbed. It does not have to be like that. There is no harm in letting someone else have a go. In cricket the captain is a deliciously important post but there is still scope for a bit of experimentation. It is tempting to be mesmerised by the mystique of the great captain, which is mostly Mike Brearley’s fault. In fact his period in charge was a consequence of a freakish set of circumstances involving two larger than life characters – Kerry Packer and Ian Botham. Post-Brearley, the armchair experts like to seek a repeat performance in times of crisis. Today that may result in suggesting the elevation of Eoin Morgan, who last played a game of cricket with a red ball in April 2019. That is the solution of diehard adherents to the captaincy mystique. I’m not even sure that Morgan should still be captaining our white-ball sides as his performances dip. Australia sometimes show the way – by accident. Before the Ashes, out went Tim Paine out of the blue. In came Pat Cummins, an exceptional man and an exceptional cricketer but with no experience of captaincy. And he’s been very good. Arguably a distinct improvement. Admittedly England do not possess such an obvious candidate within their current team, leading us to the traditional old English way, which sends us around the counties in pursuit of “leadership” qualities. This takes us to the likes of Rory Burns, James Vince, Tom Abell, Sam Billings, Tom Westley and Will Rhodes. Ho hum. So, what of recent members of the England set-up? After a traumatic year or more even Ben Stokes may be uncertain whether the job suits him at the moment. More importantly, alongside Root, he has to be one of the the pillars of the England team in 2022. Indeed we may have to think in terms only of the next series rather than the next four years. So who could we put in charge for the three Tests against New Zealand. Stuart Broad? Possibly. One other suggestion from an armchair: Jos Buttler. I did tell you there are no simple solutions.",Sport/Sport,Joe Root should resign but finding his England replacement is not easy | Vic Marks,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/27/joe-root-should-resign-finding-england-replacement-west-indies-cricket
3/28/2022,"My mother-in-law, Sheila Paine, who has died aged 92, was an authority on tribal embroideries. During her eventful life she journeyed alone to some of the remotest parts of the world, in search of the origin of textile patterns and traditions, about which she wrote a series of acclaimed books. Sheila was born in Balham, south London, to Barbara (nee Sykes), a housewife-secretary, and Edgar Thorpe, a quantity surveyor for London Transport. She attended Nonsuch grammar school and the French Lycée, in London, followed by Hammersmith College of Art, where she did a foundation course. On a ship sailing to South Africa in 1951, on her way to work in the German-speaking law courts in Windhoek, Namibia, as a translator, she met Leslie Paine. They married two years later, then returned to the UK and went on to have four children. The family lived in Cheshire and Surbiton before buying a plot and building a house in Blewbury, Oxfordshire. Desperate to obtain the education she had missed in travelling to Africa, Sheila enrolled at Oxford Polytechnic in the late 1960s and later taught modern languages there. The shocking death of Leslie, in the Turkish Airlines plane crash outside Paris on 3 March 1974, changed things for ever. Sheila had always had an eye for textiles, and had begun to collect English samplers, which adorned the walls of Morters, the family home in Blewbury. But after Leslie’s death she would set off to the remotest of places with just her small bag, limited to 6kg (including the ever-present bottle of vodka); toothbrushes were cut in half to save weight. Then she would be gone, to the Hindu Kush and Karakoram Mountains, the depths of Siberia, Africa and Central Asia. Always alone, always completely focused. On her return, the bag would have expanded to accommodate the treasured textiles she had found, each carefully photographed, tagged, and forensically examined and described. Sheila’s remarkable journeys resulted in a series of books describing her search for an embroidered motif that she described as the “linen goddess” – a representation of a female figure that can be found from high in the Himalayas to the Greek islands. Her trilogy – The Afghan Amulet (1994), The Golden Horde (1997) and The Linen Goddess (2003) – has become a classic of travel writing. More books followed, including two for the British Museum on the textiles of Pakistan and India, a world encyclopedia of embroidered textiles and the acclaimed Amulets: A World of Secret Powers, Charms and Magic (2004). In 2017 the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford published Embroidered Visions. The photographs themselves were exhibited in a gallery at the museum. Sheila stopped travelling when she reached 80, after fracturing her back. Later, and much to her disappointment, she put her remarkable collection of textiles up for auction when no institution could be found to buy it. She is survived by her children, Denzil, Rosamund, Morwenna and Imogen, six grandchildren and her brother, David.",News/From the Guardian,Sheila Paine obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2022/mar/27/sheila-paine-obituary

3/28/2022,"The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has sought to reassure Israel and its Gulf allies that Iran will never acquire atomic weapons, ahead of the possible renewal of the nuclear deal with Tehran. “When it comes to the most important element, we see eye to eye,” Blinken said at a news conference on Sunday with Israel’s foreign minister, Yair Lapid. “We are both committed, both determined, that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon.” Blinken’s comments came before a meeting with four Arab foreign ministers at an extraordinary summit hosted by Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett – an event that in itself shows how the landscape of Israel’s relations with some Arab states has been transformed in the past 18 months, driven partly by fears about the imminent end of Iran’s economic isolation. The US also sought to reassure the ad hoc alliance that Washington would not agree to Iran’s demand for the US to lift its designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a foreign terrorist organisation. Speaking at the Doha forum in Qatar, Robert Malley, the US special envoy on Iran, said: “This is not a deal that is intended to resolve that issue. Many in the region view the IRGC in the same way we view them. I can tell you that the IRGC will remain sanctioned under US law, and our perceptions, our views, our policy towards the IRGC have not changed.” A senior adviser to Iran’s supreme leader insisted earlier at the same event that the removal of the IRGC from sanctions was a precondition for the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal. Talks on the deal have been under way for nearly a year in Vienna. “The IRGC is the national army and the national army cannot be listed as a terrorist group,” said Sayyid Kamal Kharrazi. “The real thing is that IRGC is very important for Iran and they are not going to compromise on that.” The IRGC is a centrepiece of the Iranian’s regime’s power base, and its activities in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria have, in Iran’s eyes, been central to reducing the influence of Islamist terrorism, the US, and Gulf monarchies that depend on the US for their power. The corps has been designated as a terrorist organisation since 2019 and had sanctions imposed upon it in 2017, but its activities across the Middle East have been kept off the table by Iran, which has insisted the agenda focus solely on the terms for America’s return to the nuclear deal. The US walked out of the deal in 2018, leading Iran in stages to reduce its own commitments under the deal, including expanding its ability to enrich uranium. Malley said the Biden administration could promise only that the US under its watch would remain in the deal so long as Iran remains in compliance with its terms. Kharrazi said there were 500 other individuals and institutions subject to US sanctions that had “direct impact” on Iran’s relations with the west, and called for the US to take actions on those too. Kharrazi, a former foreign minister, is the president of Strategic Council on Foreign Relations in Tehran and his views are closely in line with those of the Iranian regime. Malley refused to be upbeat about a deal, saying: “We have been pretty close for some time and that I think that tells you the difficulty of the issues that remain.” Also on Sunday, the EU’s coordinator for the nuclear talks met Iran’s foreign minister and its chief negotiator. “Working on closing the remaining gaps in the #ViennaTalks,” the EU diplomat Enrique Mora tweeted before his trip. “We must conclude this negotiation. Much is at stake.” In the US, Republican and Democrat senators are coming together to form an alliance this week to block any recognition of the IRGC or any lifting of sanctions on the organisation. In a joint statement last week, the Israeli prime minister and foreign minister said: “The IRGC is a terrorist organisation that has murdered thousands of people including Americans. We refuse to believe that the US would remove its designation as a terrorists organisation. The IRGC are Hezbollah in Lebanon, Jihad in Gaza, they are Houthis in Yemen, they are the militias in Iraq. They kill Jews because they are Jews, they kill Christians because they are Christian, and Muslims because they refuse to surrender to them.” Speaking in Israel, Blinken nevertheless defended the principle of trying to revive the Iran nuclear deal, saying: “The US believes that a return to full implementation of the deal is the best way to put Iran’s nuclear programme back in the box that it was in, but has escaped from since the United States withdrew from that agreement. “But whether there’s a deal or not, our commitment to the core principle of Iran never acquiring a nuclear weapon is unwavering. And one way or another, we will continue to coordinate closely with our Israeli partners on the way forward.” The Doha summit was also attended by foreign ministers from Bahrain, Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. Malley revealed that the British have taken on the task of negotiating the release of US dual nationals still held in Iran, including Morad Tabhaz, the tri-national who was not released nearly a fortnight ago along with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Roxanne Tahbaz, his daughter, has accused the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, of a betrayal of her family. When Tahbaz was allowed out on furlough the family complained about the number of armed guards accompanying him. He was subsequently sent back to Evin prison but then moved to a hotel in Tehran after representations by the British and American governments, the Foreign Office said.",News/World news,"Iran will never acquire nuclear weapons, US promises Israel",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/iran-will-never-acquire-nuclear-weapons-us-promises-israel
3/28/2022,"The daughter of a British man murdered by Islamic State will demand to know the whereabouts of his remains when one of his alleged kidnappers goes on trial in the US this week. Bethany Haines, 24, will fly from her home in Perthshire, Scotland, to Virginia to confront El Shafee Elsheikh in person, nearly eight years after her father, David Haines, was killed. Haines said she would plead with Elsheikh “to do the right thing” and reveal where the remains of her father and other western hostages lie. “Don’t do it for me,” she will tell him. “Do it for my son, so that he can finally say goodbye to his grandad.” Elsheikh, one of the so-called “Beatles” group of British IS members, will become the most senior Islamic State fighter to face western justice when his trial gets under way in Alexandria this week. The 33-year-old from Shepherd’s Bush, west London, is accused of being involved in the murder of 28 British, American and foreign hostages in Syria between 2014 and 2015. He denies the charges. Haines will be in court every day of the trial and will read out a victim impact statement if Elsheikh is convicted. “I’ve prepared for this for years,” she told the Sunday Times. “I want to be able to see him at all times; to see his facial expressions.” She doubts Elsheikh will show remorse. “He thinks he’s above this all,” she said. “It’s all beneath him. He even smirked at a witness at an earlier hearing.” David Haines, a former RAF engineer, was a humanitarian aid worker in Syria when he was abducted in 2013. Footage of his murder was shared around the world. His daughter said it felt “like a miracle” that Elsheikh would finally face justice. The former IS fighter has told investigators he has specific details about David Haines’ death. He has also claimed that Mohammed Emwazi, the ringleader nicknamed “Jihadi John”, buried James Foley, a US citizen, and burned the body of Steven Sotloff, a US journalist. Haines, who has repeatedly travelled to Syria in the search for answers about her father’s death, said she would make clear in court that his murder had nothing to do with religion. She told the Telegraph: “When it first happened I was young and naive. I thought: Christians don’t go around doing this stuff. But when I travelled to Syria I met so many Muslims who had been affected by IS. It changed my view and woke me up – this has absolutely nothing to do with religion. It’s despicable for them to hide behind that.” Some families of the victims were frustrated when the US agreed to drop the death penalty in the case in exchange for access to sensitive operational information from British authorities. She said: “Frankly I just wanted them to be hung from a tree, anywhere. I wanted them to disappear, because prison isn’t going to change their mind. They’re hardened extremists who will never feel anything close to remorse. Why do they deserve to be on this planet when they’ve committed unspeakable crimes?” The trial is scheduled to last up to four weeks and hear from 70 witnesses, including intelligence officers and other victims not included on the indictment.",News/UK news,Daughter of David Haines to confront his alleged Islamic State kidnapper in US trial,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/27/david-haines-bethany-to-confront-alleged-islamic-state-kidnapper-us-trial
3/28/2022,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have insisted they are interested only in a “better future” for the Commonwealth, not in who leads it, at the end of their tour of the Caribbean. William said foreign tours were an “opportunity to reflect” and he and his wife were committed to “serving and supporting” the people of the Commonwealth, not “telling them what to do”, in a statement published on the couple’s Twitter account. After William signalled on Friday that the UK would support with “pride and respect” any decision by Jamaica, Belize or the Bahamas to break away from the British monarchy, he issued a statement acknowledging the tour had brought into “sharper focus questions about the past and the future”. The couple visited the three countries during a week-long tour to mark the Queen’s platinum jubilee and were met with calls for slavery reparations and fury over the Windrush scandal. William wrote that the couple “learn so much” from foreign tours, such as “what is on the minds of prime ministers” – an apparent reference to remarks by Jamaica’s prime minister, Andrew Holness, who suggested to the couple that his country could become a republic. Holness said Jamaica was “moving on” and intended to “fulfil our true ambitions and destiny as an independent, developed, prosperous country”. William wrote: “I know that this tour has brought into even sharper focus questions about the past and the future. In Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas, that future is for the people to decide upon. But we have thoroughly enjoyed spending time with communities in all three countries, understanding more about the issues that matter most to them.” He said he and Kate were “committed to service”, adding: “For us that’s not telling people what to do. It is about serving and supporting them in whatever way they think best, by using the platform we are lucky to have.” William said tours like the one they had just finished “reaffirm our desire to serve the people of the Commonwealth and to listen to communities around the world”. He wrote: “Who the Commonwealth chooses to lead its family in the future isn’t what is on my mind. What matters to us is the potential the Commonwealth family has to create a better future for the people who form it, and our commitment to serve and support as best we can.” Speaking at a reception in the Bahamas’ capital, Nassau, on Friday, where guests included the prime minister, Philip Davis, William acknowledged that the three states’ relationship with the royal family was changing. “Next year, I know, you are all looking forward to celebrating 50 years of independence – your golden anniversary,” he said. “And with Jamaica celebrating 60 years of independence this year, and Belize celebrating 40 years of independence last year, I want to say this: we support with pride and respect your decisions about your future.” Reacting to the couple’s statement on Sunday, Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, an activist and the author of This is Why I Resist: Don’t Define My Black Identity, tweeted: “This thread shows Prince William is disingenuous & demonstrates zero intention to Reconciliation/Truth & Justice for enslaved/colonised nations.

3/28/2022,"It was John Kear, the legendary rugby league coach who created Challenge Cup history with Sheffield Eagles in 1998, who described coaching as chaos, a sentiment Daryl Powell would certainly agree with right now. For three weeks, it appeared a seamless transition into the role of Warrington Wolves head coach for Powell, with three successive wins to start the new Super League season and his tenure at the club. But his exasperated reactions here as his side’s Challenge Cup hopes slipped away in excruciating fashion emphasised how the honeymoon period is now emphatically over for Powell at Warrington. This is now four consecutive defeats in all competitions and, although they have endured more convincing losses in that run, this result will be the toughest to take. Not since 2008 have Warrington failed to make the Challenge Cup quarter-finals but this year they will be watching from home. And they will be watching a Wakefield side who more than merited their place in the last eight, where they will face Wigan Warriors. Trinity’s fortunes in 2022 have almost been a mirror image of Warrington’s; they were winless in the opening month but they now have three successive wins. Here, they battled back from a 12-6 half‑time deficit to keep Warrington scoreless in the second half and score two remarkable tries of their own to edge a thrilling cup encounter. But the boos from the Warrington fans at full-time struck a chord. Expectations are high in this part of the rugby league world, with plenty of high-earning international stars in the Wolves’ ranks. But as they toiled to try to vanquish Wakefield here to no avail, the frustrations from almost everyone associated with the club were palpable. “It’s tough to take, really tough to take,” Powell said post-match. “We’re not performing well and we’re getting rattled. Wakefield sensed that and they had the players to take advantage. I knew there’d be some work to do and it’s a little bit harder than we thought, but we’ve got to hold our nerve.” Trinity took advantage in the second half, with two tries in as many minutes proving to be decisive enough. After Reece Lyne broke from deep to touch down, in the following set Wakefield produced the move of the match. Mason Lino, Wakefield’s mercurial scrum-half, was at the heart of it, just like he was for everything the visitors did well. Trinity kept the ball alive in impressive fashion, with Max Jowitt holding his nerve and providing the clinical pass for Corey Hall to put Wakefield ahead for the first time. They had the wherewithal and resilience at the opposite end to ensure that four-point lead would be enough by the full-time hooter. “The whole objective at this stage is to get into the hat,” Willie Poching, Wakefield’s coach, said. It is the first time in three years that Wakefield have reached the quarter‑finals but, in the early exchanges, it looked unlikely they would emerge victorious. Warrington raced into a 12-0 lead when Josh Thewlis and Connor Wrench crossed for tries but, as the half wore on, Wakefield dug deep and clawed their way back into a contest that looked at one stage to be slipping away. Their resilience paid off when Lewis Murphy crossed in the corner just before half-time, with Lino converting from the touchline. They were unfortunate not to perhaps get another try when Kelepi Tanginoa was visibly pulled back as he raced for a kick on the half‑time hooter, but the referee, Jack Smith, opted against penalising the chasing Warrington defenders. But after half-time the balance of power swung firmly in Wakefield’s favour as Lino took control, laying on the tries for Lyne and Hall. All eyes then fell on Warrington to see how they would respond to falling behind for the first time but, in a theme that is fast becoming familiar for Wolves supporters, they and Powell ultimately ended up frustrated.",Sport/Sport,Corey Hall try completes Wakefield’s Challenge Cup comeback at Warrington,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/27/warrington-wakefield-challenge-cup-match-report
3/28/2022,"Chris Wallace has said working at Fox News became “increasingly unsustainable” before he jumped ship to CNN last December after almost 20 years with the right-leaning cable channel. His departure dealt a blow to Fox’s news operation at a time when its opinion side had become preeminent. The veteran journalist’s new show begins on archrival CNN’s streaming service this week and the 74-year-old spoke to the New York Times. “I’m fine with opinion: conservative opinion, liberal opinion. But when people start to question the truth – ‘Who won the 2020 election? Was January 6 an insurrection?’ – I found that unsustainable,” he told the newspaper. He added: “Before, I found it was an environment in which I could do my job and feel good about my involvement at Fox. And since November of 2020, that just became unsustainable, increasingly unsustainable as time went on.” When asked why he didn’t leave Fox News earlier, he said: “I spent a lot of 2021 looking to see if there was a different place for me to do my job.” And he acknowledged: “Some people might have drawn the line earlier, or at a different point…I think Fox has changed over the course of the last year and a half. But I can certainly understand where somebody would say, ‘Gee, you were a slow learner, Chris’.” After Donald Trump lost the November 2020 election to Joe Biden, Fox skewed further from news to comment, ending its 7pm nightly broadcast, firing the political editor who had been part of Fox accurately projecting on election night that Trump had lost the crucial state of Arizona and promoting Tucker Carlson, the populist commentator and host who has consistently downplayed the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, by extremist Trump supporters, the New York Times noted. Carlson and other voices aired by Fox have spent the past four weeks playing down Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, going soft on Putin, and undermining the messages of the invaded country’s sovereignty and the Biden administration and Nato in supporting Ukraine. “One of the reasons that I left Fox was because I wanted to put all of that behind me,” Wallace said, adding that: “There has not been a moment when I have second-guessed myself about that decision.” Fox has won praise from the Kremlin earlier this month.",News/Media,Chris Wallace: working at Fox News became ‘unsustainable’ after election,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/mar/27/chris-wallace-fox-news-cnn
3/28/2022,"England’s ailing Test team endured another dark day as they ended their winless winter with defeat in the West Indies. The result was a foregone conclusion when the teams emerged on the fourth morning in Grenada, with the hosts putting their forlorn opponents out of their misery by sailing over the line by 10 wickets. Set a paltry 28 to take the third Test and a 1-0 series win, they needed just 29 balls to continue their proud home record in this fixture. Only once since 1968 has an England left these islands triumphant – but the problems are more stark and more immediate than that. The scrutiny over Joe Root’s captaincy will now intensify after his hopes of launching a “red-ball reset” in the Caribbean came crashing down amid familiar failings. The bare facts are inescapable: one Test victory in 17 attempts and five series without success for the first time in their history. There is a power vacuum at the top of the England and Wales Cricket Board – with no permanent chair, director of cricket or head coach – and it now seems more likely than ever that Root’s position could be the next to become vacant. This decisive third Test had started with everything on the line and England relatively confident after getting the better of two flat track draws in Antigua and Barbados. But at the key moments they reverted to type, with the top order blown away twice on a sporty but hardly unplayable surface. Things came crashing down on day three, when tepid bowling gave way to dreadful batting and left the tourists with a slender 10-run lead and just two wickets in hand. There was a modicum of resolve on show – just enough to make the specialist batters wonder how and why they had proved so easy to dislodge – with the lead nudged up to 27 in 54 minutes. Both sides were essentially going through the motions for most of that time, so it was fitting that Kemar Roach was the player to wrap up the England innings. The 33-year-old quick has never made any secret of his passion for this fixture and showed what it meant to him as he celebrated the wickets of Chris Woakes and Jack Leach. Woakes was the victim of a superb one-handed grab by Jason Holder at leg gully, with Leach caught behind by Josh Da Silva. Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell sprinted off the field, eager to get the party started, and helped themselves to four boundaries as they romped over the line to the delight of the home fans. Woakes had shared the new ball with Saqib Mahmood but, not for the first time on a trip which has made fans pine for the class of James Anderson and Stuart Broad, there was no joy to be had.
