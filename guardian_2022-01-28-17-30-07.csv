1/28/2022,"The debut album from singer-songwriter Samm Henshaw has a heavy American flavour. Built from strains of rootsy, old-school soul, 90s hip-hop, bluesy jazz and gospel, tracks such as Chicken Wings – with its references to “curly fries super-sized, sweet tea and lemonade” – and Waterbreak, a dreamy sax interlude preaching hydration, seem to be marinated in its culture. It’s there in a literal sense too: Henshaw delivers many of his lyrics in an almost cartoonishly strong US twang. So it’s a little disorientating to discover that the 26-year-old actually hails from south London. In fact, it’s a piece of context that could easily nudge this record into the realm of clever, tasteful but unremarkable tribute, rather than bracingly personal work of art (although it should be noted that the gospel influence can be traced back to his reverend father; the British strain of the genre is perennially overlooked).  What prevents Untidy Soul from falling into that category are Henshaw’s lyrics. His themes are intimate and of the moment: this is an album about modern notions of selfhood – fallibility, hypocrisy, self-improvement and self-worth. Enough meditates on perfectionism; opener Thoughts and Prayers is a frank internal monologue about morality and self-image; on Still Broke – written after he was dropped from Columbia – he fails to find validation in work, money and fame. Gratifyingly, none of this is carried out with a self-serious, woe-is-me attitude – instead Henshaw comes across as wry, low-key and self-effacing. Perhaps there is some distinctively British character here after all.",Arts/Music,"Samm Henshaw: Untidy Soul review – a wry, low-key take on the modern self",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/28/samm-henshaw-untidy-soul-review
1/28/2022,"E-scooters could all be given the same distinctive artificial sound to warn people when they are approaching, after engineers and rival operators announced a joint research project to identify the best noise for them to make. Acoustic researchers will work with firms licensed to run UK e-scooter rental schemes with the aim of developing a universal sound for the otherwise near-silent vehicles. The sound would help alert other road users, particularly people with sight loss.  Concerns have been raised by charities for blind people about the safety of e-scooters after a number of collisions, although these have largely involved unlicensed e-scooters, which are illegal to drive on public roads, let alone pavements. The sound will be developed at University College London’s laboratories with input from the three licensed operators in London: Dott, Lime and Tier. The multinational operators want to give all their e-scooters the same sound, and hope to set an industry standard for the UK and around the world. Researchers are aiming for the new sound to be sufficiently distinctive and audible to alert those with sight loss, while not creating further difficulty for those with hearing loss and neurodiverse conditions. A spokesperson said a range of noises would be “ethically tested” at UCL’s Person-Environment-Activity Research Laboratory. Prof Nick Tyler, the director of the facility, said: “Through studying how the human hearing system has evolved, we can create sounds for e-scooters that are detectable without adding more noise to the environment. It is a huge scientific challenge, but one that will enable everyone to feel comfortable with this new form of micromobility that is quickly growing in popularity.” Fred Jones, a regional general manager with the e-scooter operator Tier, said developing “an inclusive sound for e-scooters will be crucial to protecting pedestrians and road users potentially made vulnerable through the introduction of this new transport mode”. The project will build on work done by operators with disability charities and other acoustic researchers. The chair of Transport for London’s independent disability advisory group, Joanna Wootten, said they were excited that the venture would be “breaking new ground where there are currently no standards or regulations in place”. Dr Antonio Torija Martinez, an acoustic researcher at the University of Salford, said they had developed a standalone system with variable noises reflecting speed, but were continuing to look into “developing warning sounds for an optimal balance between noticeability and annoyance”. Trials of legal rental e-scooter schemes continue across the UK, with the government still giving no indication of its long-term decision over the vehicle’s future. Sales of unregulated e-scooters have led to increasing numbers of crashes and deaths, according to a report from the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety.",News/UK news,E-scooter firms to develop universal warning sound after collisions,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/28/e-scooter-firms-to-develop-universal-warning-sound-after-collisions
1/28/2022,"What’s the first thing an Essex girl does in the morning? Gets up and rebrands her home county as very different from the sexist and snobbish stereotypes of it that sadly prevail in the rest of Britain. Admittedly, this is even less funny than the original punchline – which, if you grew up near Chelmsford, like me, you’ve probably heard before, and which triggered a BBC internal investigation a few years ago when someone told it live on Radio 1.  It is, however, very much of a piece with Essex council’s efforts to rebrand a county that – how to put this? – may not previously have topped everyone’s travel bucket list as a tourist destination. Forget the world of blindingly white teeth and “no carbs before Marbs” so artfully brought to life by the reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. Instead, adverts featuring scientists, Michelin-starred chefs and Boudicca’s campaign of resistance against the Romans will form part of a £300,000 campaign portraying the county as an undiscovered oasis of culture, wine (as in rolling vineyards, not as in getting hammered on pink prosecco) and oysters for lunch on the coast at West Mersea. This forgotten Essex is the bucolic landscape immortalised by Constable, not the place you go to grab a selfie at Sugar Hut, the Towie crew’s nightclub of choice. All of which is technically true, of course. It’s just that the old, rackety Essex is the one I actually loved. This is not the first attempt to posh it up. Although, having just made a nostalgic pilgrimage back with old friends for someone’s landmark birthday, I’d say the poshing up quietly happened a while ago. The steady exodus of the priced-out-of-London over the last two decades means the comfortably scruffy countryside we grew up in is commuter land now; the muddy farms are spruced up to within an inch of their lives and the pubs in which we drank furtively, underage, have long since been converted into expensive-looking houses. Even the towns we remembered as a cheerful riot of white stilettos and fights in nightclubs are now all smart new shopping centres and sleek “riverside eating experiences” – which no longer seems to mean eating crisps while contemplating the shopping trolleys abandoned in the murky depths of the River Chelmer, but dressing up for brunch. Pretty much the only place so unchanged as to be instantly capable of transporting us back in time, as we wandered around arguing about where the Wimpy used to be, was the park where as teens everyone drank cheap cider and threw up in the bushes. Well, that’s just progress, or maybe middle age. You can’t go back to the past and expect to find it preserved in aspic, or even (judging by the estate agents’ windows) expect to be able to afford to live there now. But the row stirred up by this latest rebranding exercise is really about class rather than money. As the Towie star Gemma Collins indignantly told the Sun: “To say we need to change our ‘reputation’ is an affront to every hardworking person from Essex who has grafted to make something of themselves.” There was always more than one Essex – rural and town, the metropolitan bit that bleeds into London and the wilder marshy fringes, kiss-me-quick Southend and genteel Frinton – but its public face is brash, aspirational, emphatically working class, and not to be messed with or sanitised even in the name of flogging staycations. In her book Essex Girls, an intellectual attempt to reconcile that image with her own feelings about growing up in Chelmsford, the author Sarah Perry argues that there is a thread connecting Boudicca to Collins – and that it’s one of defiance. Essex girls have, she writes, for too long carried “the loathing and anxiety of both sides of the political spectrum, and all points in between” on their spray-tanned shoulders, having been not only slut-shamed or dismissed as airheads down the ages, but portrayed as heartless Thatcherites to boot – although it was “Basildon man” who was always said to have delivered the county for the Tories, as if “Basildon woman” (who also swung to Margaret Thatcher) was somehow too dim to get to grips with voting. The Essex girls Perry celebrates in her book are edgy and radical, from the 19th-century abolitionist Anne Knight to two suffragette sisters from Ingatestone, and the argument she constructs makes sense. But I gave up on the book halfway through in frustration, because my Essex isn’t to be found in literary essays. My Essex is a pancake-flat, dead ordinary hunk of East Anglia that has ingeniously vajazzled itself up into something much more interesting by leveraging the idea of Essex as a cheeky, sexy, loudly inappropriate cultural and economic phenomenon. That idea, much like Towie’s heavily scripted idea of reality, treads an admittedly hazy line between truth and fiction. But my Essex makes the most of its assets without pretending to be what it isn’t, and attempting to rebrand Brentwood as the historically significant birthplace of the peasants’ revolt – rather than as the home of the beauty salon that introduced a goggle-eyed nation to the concept of sticking jewels on your bikini wax – is its antithesis. How do you reinvent a place that has already reinvented itself in ways no other county would dare? Try it, and the joke’s on you.

1/28/2022,"Tom Tugendhat, the high-profile chair of the foreign affairs committee, once described the job of prime minister as like “winning the lottery”. With a dearth of options in the cabinet for the party’s centrist wing to rally behind in a future leadership contest, he is the name many more have started to mention should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence.  “Tom would be my first choice,” one former cabinet minister said. “I think a lot of people think he would be the best chance for a fresh start with someone who has a lot of relevant experience and deep thinking.” On paper, the MP for Tonbridge’s chances of success seem slim – his name comes up often as one of the rank outsiders to succeed Johnson, with odds of about 16-1. But his name is the one that MPs most often bring up of their own accord, once they have finished expressing their varying degrees of doubt about Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss. Tugendhat is from pure Tory stock, the nephew of the Tory peer Lord Tugendhat and the son of a high court judge. He had a long and distinguished military career, serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, working for the FCO in Afghanistan and for the then chief of defence staff Lord David Richards. During the fall of Kabul, he was furious at the chaos of the evacuation and the approach of world leaders, including Biden, and gave a raw and personal speech in the Commons that was widely praised. Like the prime minister, his speeches often lapse into multiple languages, in Tugendhat’s case, Arabic, Dari and French. But the pair have a unique loathing for each other, clashing pointedly at select committee hearings and Tugendhat has made little secret of his disdain for the prime minister’s approach. One senior MP said it would be “a relief, by all accounts, to have someone like that in the job at the moment”. Another minister said they were also hoping for Tugendhat to run – “though he’d need to convince other colleagues he’s got any sort of domestic policy ideas whatsoever. We all know what he thinks about China or Afghanistan.” One issue is Tugendhat has no ministerial experience, although an ally was quick to note he had “experience running governments, just not this one” – a nod to his time in Afghanistan. Observant MPs say they have noticed a slew of recent interventions by Tugendhat on wider policy matters – particular in the Mail on Sunday – on the need for nuclear reactors, action to stop the deaths of migrants crossing in small boats and social media regulation. There are aspects that could still attract some on the party’s right. Tugendhat has been prepared to judiciously vote against stricter Covid measures – an issue likely to be high on the agenda for any leadership race. He was also a key player in the China Research Group of Tory MPs calling for a more hawkish approach to China, including opposing Huawei’s role in building 5G networks in the UK and lobbying for an amendment to the trade bill as part of recognition of the Uyghur genocide. He was banned from China as a result, along with fellow MPs Nusrat Ghani, Tim Loughton and Iain Duncan Smith, although when Johnson invited them to the Downing Street rose garden in the aftermath, Tugendhat was not among them. But Tugendhat has his fair amount of detractors on the party’s right, the chief whip, Mark Spencer, is said to have nicknamed him “Tom Tugendtwat” for his pointed criticism of the government and its actions on the world stage, including rebellions on aid, the trade bill and vehement criticism of the Kabul evacuation operation. “That kind of saintly disposition is not popular among my lot,” one MP said. “I can’t see him realistically getting past the first round [of leadership voting’].” Another called him “the Rory Stewart of the race”, a reference to the former development secretary’s failed bid in 2019. One experienced MP said the legacy of Brexit was one that could damage Tugendhat. “There is likely to be significant resistance in [Tugendhat’s] wing of the party if the government goes down the road of triggering article 16. I don’t think we are in that place yet but for sure any block on that would not play well with the membership.” But he still has some admirers in the cabinet, particularly the levelling-up secretary, Michael Gove, whom he backed for the Conservative leadership in 2017. The pair almost cleared the dancefloor spinning enthusiastically to Whitney Houston at Conservative party conference’s karaoke this year. Whatever the future of his leadership ambitions, Tugendhat has made it clear he would at least like to be offered the chance at a cabinet role. “I will serve at whatever level I’m asked to,” he told Politics Home. “Would it be great to be PM? Yep, it would be. Would it be great to be foreign secretary? Fantastic. Would it be great to be defence secretary? Wonderful. Would it be great to be a minister of any kind? Yes, because all of those opportunities to serve are very much winning a lottery.”",News/Politics,Tom Tugendhat: Tory centrist loathed by Boris Johnson could be ‘a relief’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/28/tom-tugendhat-tory-centrist-loathed-by-boris-johnson-could-be-a-relief
1/28/2022,"Alicia eats the chocolate biscuits too fast. My upbringing means I want them to last longer  We get sent a package of around 50 homemade shortbread biscuits by my mum and dad each year. Some are covered in cornflakes, others are made with marzipan and syrup, but some are covered with chocolate. They are the most delicious and our favourites, but my wife, Alicia, always eats them too fast. If I have something delicious, I want to enjoy it for the longest time possible. I like to evenly distribute my joy – I don’t eat all the best biscuits first. So I’ll take a chocolate one, then next time I’ll choose one with cornflakes or marzipan and syrup. It prolongs the joy of returning to a chocolate biscuit – you can save them for bad times. But Alicia has a completely different attitude. She wants all the good stuff now before it’s gone. The result is that we usually run out of the best biscuits too quickly. I will say each year, “Leave me some of those chocolate ones, I haven’t had many yet” and her response is, “Well, as long as they are still there, they are up for grabs.” But I don’t want to eat the best ones on her schedule; I simply want them to last longer. It makes sense to distribute them properly, but in our home if I don’t eat them quickly, I don’t get any. To keep up with her I would have to force myself to eat them more quickly, but that’s no fun. Sometimes I’ll ask her not to eat them as fast, but it doesn’t resonate. Also, the biscuits come from my family, so really I should get the most say. I grew up making these biscuits with my parents when I was a boy, so they are special to me. I was raised in a disciplined household and I’m used to being methodical. As a child I would eat my sweets a lot slower than my siblings. I just like to maximise my joy. I don’t want to speed up my biscuit-eating habits: why can’t Alicia try slowing hers down? Hans thinks you should save the best ones for later – but I am just not that restrained I think Hans likes having the biscuits there for the sake of it. The box is full for the first couple of weeks, so he has ample opportunity to go for what he wants. Sometimes I say, “If you want a chocolate one, eat a chocolate one.” But weirdly, he will go to the box and take another, normal biscuit. He says he doesn’t want to be forced to eat the good ones when I say so. I find it strange because Hans complains about not having access to the chocolate ones, but then when I encourage him to take one, he doesn’t want to. Perhaps he enjoys torturing me – or is he trying to teach me a lesson in self-discipline? Recently, we got down to the last two chocolate biscuits in the box. I’d had mine and I was waiting for Hans to have his since he’d complained that I’d eaten too many good ones. But it took him a whole eight days to take his chocolate biscuit! Every time I went to the box, it was there, staring back at me, tempting me. Last year the tension was heightened because my family came to our house to visit and we offered them some biscuits. The best ones disappeared more quickly because everyone likes the chocolate ones the most. It’s normal human behaviour to go for the best option first. It’s like with the chocolate selection boxes at Christmas – you just expect the nicest ones to be eaten first, you’re always left with the bad ones by the end. Hans has grown up thinking that you should save some good stuff for bad times ahead, whereas I’m not that restrained. I don’t have a huge sweet tooth, but when chocolate is in the house I do eat it quickly. If Hans wants some, I have to leave his bit in his study because if I see it in front of me, I will eat it. I think it’s silly to count out all the biscuits each year. Hans needs to stop rationing the biscuits. If they are there, just go for it. Should Alicia show some restraint with the chocolate biscuits? I understand Hans wanting to savour the chocolate biscuits and not gorge on them immediately. But leaving one for eight days is an extreme test of self-control, a legacy of his disciplined childhood. Why not ask his parents to send only chocolate biscuits and sack off the marzipan and cornflake ones?Vic, 54 Alicia is aware Hans grew up in a strict household and should let him eat the biscuits as he pleases. He is gracious to share them, albeit painstakingly. Though, Hans, I have to say, “Life is short, enjoy the simple pleasures, tomorrow isn’t guaranteed!”Kate, 30 Hans wants these biscuits to be eaten in precisely the way he thinks is correct. While they have some emotional importance to him, this feels rigid and uncompromising. It’s not as if Alicia is wolfing them down as soon as they arrive. He should try to relax a little.Peter, 52 I am sympathetic to Hans’s methods, but it’s not on Alicia to help maintain his discipline. I suggest he sets some biscuits aside to enjoy at his pace, or attempt a more challenging self-discipline: helping Alicia maximise her joy while he’s maximising his own.Ehab, 26 Alicia is not guilty. She doesn’t eat all the best biscuits– she encourages Hans to eat them, but he doesn’t. If Hans wants to save his share of the best ones, he could put them into a separate tin, then eat them at his leisure.Sarah, 39 So now you can be the judge, click on the poll below to tell us: should Alicia stop eating the chocolate biscuits so quickly?

1/28/2022,"In the first two days of January, the average Briton was already responsible for more carbon dioxide emissions than someone from the Democratic Republic of the Congo would produce in an entire year, according to analysis by the Center for Global Development (CGD). The study, which highlights the “vast energy inequality” between rich and poor countries, found that each Briton produces 200 times the climate emissions of the average Congolese person, with people in the US producing 585 times as much. By the end of January, the carbon emitted by someone living in the UK will surpass the annual emissions of citizens of 30 low- and middle-income countries, it found.  Euan Ritchie, a policy analyst at CGD Europe, said his work was prompted by the “climate hypocrisy” of western countries, including the UK and the US, that have pledged to stop aid funding to fossil fuel projects in developing states. “At Cop26 there was lots of hand-wringing by rich countries about the extent to which aid and other development finance should finance fossil fuels in poorer countries,” said Ritchie. “The hypocrisy of this caught my attention.” “Our analysis shows that in just a few days, the average person in the UK produces more climate emissions than people in many low-income countries do in an entire year. It would be a cruel irony if the countries that have least contributed to this problem won’t be able to have access to energy infrastructure.” Several countries, including some developing countries, and finance institutions have signed up to a pledge to end public support for international fossil fuel projects. The same countries will be able to continue to develop fossil fuels at home. The US has at least 24 pending fossil fuel projects representing more than 1.6 gigatons of potential greenhouse gas emissions, while the UK is licensing new oil and gas fields in the North Sea. The CGD research used World Bank data of per capita carbon emissions for each country, spread out over a year, to calculate the point at which a British or US citizen’s energy use surpassed that of someone living in a low- or middle-income country. About 940 million people, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, do not have access to electricity. African leaders, including President Muhammadu Buhari of Nigeria, who has committed Nigeria to net zero by 2060, and Lazarus Chakwera, the president of Malawi, have spoken out about their countries’ need to transition to net zero via natural gas. The Energy for Growth Hub, an international research network, estimates that if 48 countries in Africa, excluding South Africa and several north African nations, tripled their electricity consumption through use of natural gas, the resulting carbon emissions would be less than 1% of the global total. Vijaya Ramachandran, the director for energy and development at the Breakthrough Institute in Berkeley, California, argues that blanket bans on fossil fuel projects in poor countries are “colonial” and will entrench poverty while doing little to reduce the world’s carbon emissions. “It’s very easy for rich countries to impose fossil fuel financing bans on poor countries, while at the same time increasing their own consumption of fossil fuels,” she said. “It’s rank hypocrisy and it’s devastating for poor countries as they need a wide range of energy to fuel development. “It’s well known renewable energy is intermittent and needs to be backed up by other sources. Telling African countries they just need solar is completely hypocritical and colonial.” Rose M Mutiso, the research director of Energy for Growth Hub, said the CGD research should be used to inform the debate over responsibility for the climate crisis. “Solving the climate crisis in the medium term is the responsibility of high emitting countries, not only because they caused the problem but logically, it’s where high emissions are concentrated,” said Mutiso, who is Kenyan. “The video gaming industry in California is using more energy than entire African countries,” she said. “There’s this idea that in California we can’t live without video games, or air conditioning, but we are worried about Africans moving up and consuming. It’s really important for us as Africans to establish that our development is non-negotiable. All of those decades of exploitation and being left behind – that is owed to us.” Mutiso cited a 2019 study that estimated electricity demand from gaming in California alone would grow from 5 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2011 to as much as 11TWh by 2021, the same as Sri Lanka’s entire consumption.",News/Global development,West accused of ‘climate hypocrisy’ as emissions dwarf those of poor countries ,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/28/west-accused-of-climate-hypocrisy-as-emissions-dwarf-those-of-poor-countries
