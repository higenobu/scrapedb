4/16/2022,"By James Mackenzie HUSARIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - Smashed tanks in the mud, destroyed buildings and mourning families mark a recaptured east Ukrainian village whose residents are contemplating the price both they and their former Russian occupiers have had to pay. Ukrainian soldiers last month retook Husarivka, an agricultural village with a peacetime population of 500-600 around 150 km southeast of Kharkiv city, after heavy fighting following the Russian invasion on Feb. 24. As Russian forces pull back after failing to take major cities including Kyiv and Kharkiv to refocus their offensive on the Donbas region in the southeast, residents of the surrounding areas are beginning to clean up after weeks of occupation. Echoing accounts of ill-disciplined and poorly-supplied Russian forces from other localities in north and east Ukraine where the Russians have retreated, 79-year-old Nadezhda Syrova said young soldiers had gone house-to-house asking for food. Some of the invading Russians said they were on a training exercise or there to clear Ukraine of bandits and ""Nazis"", she added, standing on a patch of ground near her house. ""Where do you see bandits and Nazis here? We are just normal, peaceful people. Ukrainians,"" she said. In fields above the village, burned-out armoured personnel carriers and two smashed Russian anti-aircraft gun carriers sit abandoned in the mud surrounded by detritus including gas masks, computer printers and sodden footwear. In the village itself, a destroyed Russian tank, already rusting, rests on the road, its blown off turret by its side. A Ukrainian soldier said fighting went on for around three weeks with his side using anti-tank weapons, including artillery and foreign-supplied Javelin missiles, finally driving out two Russian battalion tactical groups. ""We bypassed the enemy from the right and the left, got into good positions and destroyed their equipment,"" said the soldier, who spoke to reporters on condition he be identified only by his nickname Parker. He said his unit had captured a Russian officer and two scouts from an engineering unit trying to plant mines around the village to stop the Ukrainian attack and had to fight off counter-attacks by what he described as Russian sabotage and reconnaissance groups. ""Three times we fought off attacks when they tried to enter,"" he said. BURNED BODIES It was not possible to confirm his account independently but at least a dozen destroyed armoured vehicles, including tanks with the distinctive ""Z"" markings of Russian forces, remained in the village and surrounding fields. Ukrainian authorities say their forces have killed almost 20,000 Russian troops and destroyed hundreds of tanks and armoured personnel carriers since the invasion began. Other estimates are much lower but Western officials estimate the numbers of Russian dead run into the thousands. Ukraine also says that hundreds of Ukrainian civilians have been killed while under Russian occupation. Russia has denied targeting civilians but locals in Husarivka said several local people were killed or had disappeared. Three bodies, burned beyond recognition, have been recovered from the cellar of one house and taken away to be investigated for possible signs of torture, they said. The state of Husarivka matches accounts in a string of villages east of Kharkiv, a mainly Russian-speaking city near Ukraine's northeastern border, which was targeted by President Vladimir Putin's army from the first days of the war. Though no longer threatening to enter the city, Russia has kept up a partial blockade and subjected it to days of increasingly heavy bombardment. Kharkiv residential buildings and infrastructure have been hit, causing dozens of casualties, with more than 60 artillery and rocket attacks in one night this week. On Friday, Reuters journalists heard mortar rounds hit northern areas of the city.

4/16/2022,"A 40-year-old Wichita man must serve life plus 570 months in prison for sexually assaulting a young girl starting when she was 9, a Sedgwick County judge ruled this week. The man, Bryce Patrick Hanks, who was convicted of 12 crimes at his February trial including 10 felony assaults against the girl, will be in prison for a minimum of 72 1/2 years before he can be released. By that time, he would be well over 100 years old — longer than most people’s natural life. The Sedgwick County District Attorney’s Office announced the sentence in a Friday news release. Hanks has maintained his innocence in court filings and has notified the court of his intent to file an appeal. Court records say Hanks met the girl, who is now 18, when she was 8 years old and first started fondling her when she was 9. The assaults happened so often that by the time she was 13, she was “just living with it,” an arrest affidavit released by the court says.. The girl told authorities Hanks raped her the first time shortly before her 14th birthday after he bought her a bra, insisted she model it and forced himself on her, the affidavit says. After the assault, he called her his wife. He continued assaulting her regularly — weekly, she estimated — for at least two years and would refer to her as his spouse because he believed they were in a relationship and that is “what the lord would want,” the affidavit says. He also gave her money because he thought they were a couple, the document says. Wichita police began investigating the case in 2020 after someone overheard the girl telling Hanks by phone that she didn’t want to have sex with him anymore, the affidavit says. Prosecutors tried Hanks on a total of 15 crimes at his February trial. The jury found him guilty of four counts of rape, two counts of aggravated indecent liberties with a child, two counts of aggravated criminal sodomy, two counts of criminal sodomy and two offender registration violations. He was acquitted of one count each of rape, aggravated criminal sodomy and furnishing alcohol to a minor, court records show. Hanks’ lawyer, in a Feb. 21 motion, asked District Judge Tyler Roush to consider putting his client on probation, citing Hanks’ “willingness to abide by conditions” set by the court and “the need for family preservation.” Roush refused and ordered the prison sentence.",U.S./Wichita Eagle,"Wichita man, 40, convicted of raping girl he called ‘wife’ gets life prison sentence",https://news.yahoo.com/wichita-man-40-convicted-raping-221624407.html
4/16/2022,"Elon Musk compared Mark Zuckerberg's role at Meta to that of a monarch. The Facebook founder owns the majority of Meta's voting shares. The Tesla CEO said that if he owned Twitter, he would avoid a similar stronghold. Elon Musk dissed Mark Zuckerberg's lasting control over Meta during an interview Thursday. Musk was asked about his recent offer to buy Twitter during an interview at the TED conference in Vancouver, British Columbia. The interviewer, Chris Anderson, asked Musk whether his status as the richest man and one of the platform's top influencers could pose a conflict of interest. Musk used the opportunity to take a swipe at Zuckerberg. ""As for media sort of ownership, I mean, you've got Mark Zuckerberg owning Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp, and with a share ownership structure that will have Mark Zuckerberg the 14th still controlling those entities,"" Musk said. ""Like, literally,"" Musk added amid laughter from the audience. ""We won't have that at Twitter."" Musk's statement could be referring to a future long line of Zuckerberg descendants or could be a reference to King Louis XIV, who ruled France for over 72 years and is known as the longest-reigning monarch. The Tesla CEO was also referencing Zuckerberg's stronghold on Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The Facebook founder holds 55% of the company's voting shares — which means Zuckerberg essentially has complete veto power over other shareholders when it comes to the company's future. The company has a dual-class stock structure that provides Zuckerberg, select executive managers, and directors with supervoting power inasmuch as one of their shares is equivalent to 10 votes, while other shareholders are limited to one vote per share. A Meta spokesperson didn't immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Tesla doesn't have a dual-class share structure, but Musk still enjoys considerable influence. He is the electric-car maker's largest individual shareholder, with a 17% stake. While Musk doesn't have the same level of control of the company as Zuckerberg does with Meta, Tesla does have supermajority voting rules that require the approval of two-thirds of shares to pass major changes, providing Musk a level of veto power. If he successfully bought Twitter, Musk said he would structure the company in a way that would avoid any perception of a conflict of interest, including making the platform's code publicly accessible. ""I wouldn't personally be in their editing tweets."" Musk said. ""But, you'll know if something was done to, to promote demo or otherwise affect a tweet."" Musk said his offer to buy Twitter was ""not a way to make money"" but a bid to protect freedom of speech. The Tesla CEO also appeared to diss Meta's handling of moderation efforts. The social-media company has faced pressure from both sides of the aisle on its handling of COVID-19 misinformation, as well as the Capitol siege. Musk appears to believe in erring on the side of allowing the dissemination of information as long as it is legal in the countries the platform operates in. ""I'm not saying that I have all the answers here, but I do think that we want to be just very reluctant to delete things,"" Musk said. ""And just be very cautious with permanent bans. Timeouts, I think, are better than permanent bans."" Musk and Zuckerberg have a longstanding feud. In 2016, Zuckerberg issued a public statement saying he was ""deeply disappointed"" in SpaceX after one of the company's rockets destroyed a Facebook satellite. Musk has said Facebook gives him ""the willies."" Most recently, Musk criticized Facebook for how it handled the siege on the Capitol on January 6, 2021.
