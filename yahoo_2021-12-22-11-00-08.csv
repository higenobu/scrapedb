12/22/2021,"NEW YORK — A retired NYPD officer says she quit the force — and a coveted assignment at Yankee Stadium — because her boss repeatedly raped her at the ballpark, the ex-cop claims in a Bronx Supreme Court lawsuit. The former cop alleges that New York Police Department Capt. Jeffrey Brienza first sexually assaulted her after work in a bathroom at the Bronx stadium in June 2020 and then continued to force himself on her for more than a year after that, according to the suit filed against Brienza and the city on Monday. “There were times when I used to feel like it’s unending,” the retired officer, who asked to remain anonymous, told the New York Daily News. “I would cry a lot of times. I would just wonder how am I going to get out of this. I saw no end. I felt so stuck ... I just felt so worthless and without any purpose.” The 47-year-old woman said she was working at the 50th Precinct in Riverdale when she was offered a spot on the Yankee Stadium detail in March 2020. When the 20-year-veteran started the stadium detail, Brienza took her under his wing, she said. But Brienza, 48, soon turned the woman into his personal driver and insisted she run errands with him, she told the Daily News. Three months into her time at the stadium, she said she noticed someone lurking behind her while she was washing her hands in a bathroom, according to the suit. “He grabbed me from behind around my waist,” the retiree recalled. “I grabbed him and I was peeling his hands from around my waist and I felt his grip tightening and at that point I realized what he was doing, so I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Yes.’"" The woman alleges Brienza forced her to perform oral sex on him, then pushed her up against a sink and raped her, the lawsuit details. Afterward, he left without a word, the mother of three said. “I was afraid. There was a lot of things going through my head. I was kind of blaming myself like maybe I could have yelled louder,” she explained. Days later, the woman claims Brienza called her into his office, asked her if she told anyone about what happened in the bathroom and said she could get in trouble. “Everyone thinks he’s a great guy. Everyone loves him. I was new to the stadium,” the woman said. “I was afraid to say anything because he’s the captain.” The alleged abuse continued, with Brienza forcing her to perform oral sex on him in his office or in her car, sometimes more than once a day, the lawsuit alleges. “I feel like I was being pressured each time,” she said. If she “made herself unavailable for his sexual attacks,” the lawsuit says, Brienza would give her less desirable assignments that he referred to as “piece of s--t posts,” the legal documents reveal. During the seventh inning of one Yankees game, the woman claims that instead of taking her position outside to prepare for the end of the game, Brienza made her stay in his office. Her boss pushed her head toward his groin and said, “You take your post,” according to the lawsuit. “Supervisors in the NYPD have to stop viewing their subordinates as potential sex slaves,” the woman’s lawyer, Fred Lichtmacher said. After one alleged rape in the NYPD women’s locker room at Yankee Stadium in September, the woman decided she could not take the abuse any longer, realizing it was destroying her love of the job as well as her physical and mental health, she said. “I couldn’t even set foot in the building. It was just the strangest thing,” she said. “It’s literally like I couldn’t move. I couldn’t go. My heart was racing and I would be sweaty. ... Everyone was there but no one to talk to.” That month, she reported the alleged assaults to a union delegate, who informed the NYPD, which started an Internal Affairs Bureau probe, she said. The NYPD said the allegations are under investigation and declined to comment on the lawsuit. The city Law Department said it would review the case when they’re served. Brienza was transferred to the 25th Precinct a month after the woman first spoke to the Internal Affairs Bureau. The captain could not be reached for comment, but Chris Monahan, president of the NYPD’s Captain’s Endowment Association said, “These are far-fetched and reaching allegations that will be determined untrue.” The woman retired shortly afterward and has little faith in an investigation into a higher-ranking member of the department. “The Police Department has no room for someone like me who reported your captain,” she said. “One of the things I wanted to miraculously happen is I go back to work, but I don’t think that’s reality. “I would like to know no one else will go through what I went through.” ———",U.S./NY Daily News,"Retired cop says NYPD boss repeatedly raped her at Yankee Stadium, lawsuit says",https://news.yahoo.com/retired-cop-says-nypd-boss-005400858.html
12/22/2021,"LONDON (AP) — A British court has ordered the ruler of Dubai to pay his ex-wife and their children close to 550 million pounds ($730 million), in one of the most expensive divorce settlements in British history. A High Court judge said Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum must pay 251.5 million pounds to his U.K.-based sixth wife, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussein, and make ongoing payments for their children Jalila, 14, and Zayed, 9, underpinned by a bank guarantee of 290 million pounds.  The total amount the children receive could be more or less than 290 million pounds, depending on factors including how long they live and whether they reconcile with their father.  The settlement includes 11 million pounds a year to cover security costs for Princess Haya and the children while they are minors. In a November ruling that was made public Tuesday, Judge Philip Moor said the family needed “water-tight security,"" and that “absolutely uniquely,” the main threat to them came from Sheikh Mohammed, rather than outside sources. Haya, 47, fled to the U.K. in 2019 and sought custody of her two children through the British courts. The princess, who is the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan, said she was “terrified” of her husband, who is alleged to have ordered the forced return to the Gulf emirate of two of his daughters. The long battle in Britain's family courts has disclosed personal and financial details about the powerful but publicity-shy Gulf royals who are among the world's wealthiest people. Sheikh Mohammed, 72, is also the vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is a part, and a major horse breeder. The founder of the successful Godolphin horse-racing stable, he is on friendly terms with Queen Elizabeth II. Haya, a graduate of Oxford University, is also a keen equestrian and competed in show jumping for Jordan at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. In evidence to the court, Princess Haya said she had paid 6.7 million pounds to four of her security staff who blackmailed her over her affair with a bodyguard, selling jewelry and taking money from her daughter’s bank account to get the funds. After learning of the affair, Sheikh Mohammed published a poem titled ’You Lived; You Died,” which Princess Haya interpreted as threatening. A separate British family court judge ruled in October that Sheikh Mohammed had authorized the hacking of Princess Haya’s phone during their legal battle.  Judge Andrew McFarlane said the sheikh gave his “express or implied authority” to hack the phones of the princess and her attorneys using Pegasus spyware produced by NSO Group of Israel, the court said. The software is licensed exclusively to nation states for use by their security services. Sheikh Mohammed denied knowledge of the hacking. McFarlane earlier ruled that Sheikh Mohammed had conducted a campaign of fear and intimidation against his estranged wife and “ordered and orchestrated” the abduction and forced return to Dubai of two of his adult daughters: Sheikha Shamsa in August 2000 and her sister Sheikha Latifa, in 2002 and again in 2018. The divorce bill eclipses the 450 million pound settlement awarded Tatiana Akhmedova in her 2016 split from Russian billionaire Farkhad Akhmedov, at the time cited as Britain's most expensive divorce. The settlement includes a holiday budget of 5.1 million pounds, an annual sum of just over 450,000 pounds for the children’s staff and around 275,000 pounds for their animals, including two ponies and a horse. Haya was awarded millions to compensate for property lost when she left Dubai, including 13.5 million pounds for jewelry and what the judge called “the relatively modest sum” of 1 million pounds for clothes. It is possible, but rare, for financial divorce settlements to be appealed in England.  A spokesman for Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement that the ruler “has always ensured that his children are provided for. The court has now made its ruling on finances and he does not intend to comment further.”",World/Associated Press,Dubai ruler must pay ex-wife $700M in divorce settlement,https://news.yahoo.com/dubai-ruler-must-pay-ex-122302362.html
