5/21/2022,"Pharmacists will be allowed to offer alternative hormone replacement therapy products if the original prescription is out of stock, under new rules aimed at tackling the ongoing shortage. The relaxing of normal prescribing rules, announced by the government’s HRT supply taskforce, comes amid shortages of HRT products that have left some women travelling across the country to access medicines. It follows calls, highlighted by the Guardian, by pharmacists to be allowed to dispense substitute versions of medicines without having to contact the prescriber – normally a GP – for permission each time. Health and Social Care Secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “We are working to ensure HRT is available for everyone who needs it and I am pleased to see suppliers continuing to increase the supply of some products which is a testament to the collaborative approach being taken.” “Meetings with suppliers are ongoing and we’re taking decisive action to manage HRT supply issues and reduce any delays – this includes issuing further SSPs so that women are able to access the medication they need.” Under the Serious Shortage Protocols (SSPs) announced by Javid, pharmacists will be able to offer patients another product to relieve their symptoms if their normal HRT is out of stock. At the end of April, the government issued three SSPs to restrict dispensing for Oestrogel, Ovestin and Premique Low Dose to three months’ supply to help relieve pressure in the system. The two new further SSPs are for Lenzetto transdermal spray and Sandrena gel, which will also be put on a three-month supply. Under the rules, all these items can generally be substituted for transdermal patches. Prof Claire Anderson, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, welcomed the news, saying that the short term measure would help women access supplies of HRT medicines which are difficult to get hold of. “The advice on which HRT product to substitute with another has been drawn up by experts and women can be confident they will receive what’s appropriate for them,” she said. “Women should talk to their pharmacist if they have any concerns about their HRT medicines.” However, she added that the bureaucracy involved in completing the SSP process for each patient is “quite burdensome” and said that it would still be essential to resolve the underlying HRT shortage as soon as possible. “Ultimately we’d like to see a change in the law which makes the whole process easier and quicker for both pharmacists and patients,” she added. Dr Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, welcomed the move: “This is really sensible. Pharmacists generally know their drugs. They often make those switches in other areas where the laws allow it. They should be allowed to do this for HRT and it will save a lot of bother for women.” There have been acute shortages of some HRT products, which are used by about 1 million women in the UK to treat symptoms of the menopause. The number of HRT products prescribed in England has more doubled in the last five years, contributing to stocks running low, while manufacturers have also reported supply problems. Thousands of menopausal women have struggled to access medication, which has led to some resorting to buying medicines online or even sharing medication with friends. In the new announcement, the government said there had been recent further deliveries of the popular products Oestrogel, Ovestin and Premique Low Dose. Premique now has good availability, it said, while the manufacturers of Oestrogel and Ovestin are working to increase UK supply. Head of the HRT supply taskforce, Madelaine McTernan, said: “I am very encouraged by the constructive engagement across the sector and enthusiasm with which suppliers and pharmacists are looking to work with us to meet this challenge. “Focusing both on measures that ensure we can use stocks most efficiently whilst also ensuring supply is increased is critical.”",News/Society,UK pharmacists to offer alternatives to out of stock HRT products,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/21/uk-pharmacists-to-offer-alternatives-to-out-of-stock-hrt-products
5/21/2022,"At Sainsbury’s in Whitechapel, east London, the rising cost of food has forced Petra Emmanuel to change her shopping habits. “Coupled with my utilities bill, it’s ridiculous,” the 51-year-old teacher said. “Even though I don’t buy branded foods, it’s the simplest items that have seemed to have gone up. “I’ve had to cut down on my meat intake, and on fish too, because of the cost. They are like luxuries now, which I will buy only once or twice a week compared to, say five times a week that I used to do.” Her experience is being shared by shoppers across the UK who are facing “shelf shock” on almost all types of groceries. Research by Which? has found price rises of more than 20% on some goods, while official figures this week showed many staples have recorded double-digit increases. Which? analysed the prices of more than 21,000 groceries, using average prices at eight big supermarkets, and compared costs for December last year to the end of February this year with the same period two years previously. The analysis found that the prices of 265 lines had gone up by more than a fifth. Which? said the items that had recorded the biggest price rises included a 500g box of Kellogg’s Crunchy Nut corn flakes cereal, which had gone up by 21.4% at Tesco, Asda’s own-label closed cup mushrooms (250g) which were up by the same percentage and Cathedral City extra mature cheddar (350g) which rose by 21.1% at Ocado. The consumer group said it had examples of shrinkflation – where products were smaller but selling for the same price – and that between December 2021 and February this year the availability of some value ranges had been more limited than previously. These ranges recorded the lowest inflation overall, with prices increasing by just 0.2%, while standard ranges rose by 2.8% and own-label premium ranges were up by 3.2%. Across the 20 categories of groceries Which? looked at, fizzy drinks had the biggest average price rises, at 5.9%, followed by butters and spreads, at 4.9%. On Wednesday, the Office for National Statistics reported food and drink prices were up by an average of 6% year on year, but some everyday products, including milk and pasta, had increased by more than 10%. Its figures, which cover the year to April, suggest many of the items Which? reviewed will be even more expensive now. Sue Davies, the Which? head of food policy and consumer rights, said “eye-watering” price rises were being exacerbated by other factors to put “huge pressure” on household shopping budgets. “During an unrelenting cost of living crisis, consumers should be able to easily choose the best value product for them without worrying about shrinkflation or whether their local store stocks budget ranges.” Supermarket value ranges came under the spotlight in January when the food campaigner Jack Monroe said some shoppers were experiencing huge price inflation because they were unable to access the cheapest products at their local shops. Since then Asda has committed to making its cheapest ranges available in all of its 581 food stores and online. Retailers said they were committed to making budget ranges available and to keeping down the cost of shopping. A Tesco spokesperson said: “We are committed to providing great value for our customers, whether it’s promising low everyday prices on 1,600 staples, price matching about 650 basics to Aldi prices, or offering exclusive deals and rewards through thousands of Clubcard prices.” This week the government announced it was delaying a ban on “buy one, get one free” offers on junk food in response to the cost of living crisis, but some Tesco and Sainsbury’s said they would go ahead with scrapping these promotions. The Guardian spoke to several shoppers in the Sainsbury’s in Whitechapel about how the increased cost of food prices has affected them. Sharon Adams, who is 37 and works in merchandise, says that the increased cost of food prices has really shocked her. “I almost had a heart attack when I managed to spend £20 on my food shop last Sunday, despite not buying any fresh fruit or vegetables, meat, or bread,” Adams said. “This time last year, I wouldn’t even really check or notice the cost of food. But now it’s something I’m much more mindful about.” As a consequence of the rising cost of her food shop, Adams has altered the way she shops for groceries and plans her meals, such as using food waste apps, such as Too Good to Go, in order to reduce her grocery shopping bill. “I rarely try to even try to shop in supermarkets any more and so I try to find alternatives,” Adams said. “I now use the Too Good to Go food app. It’s forced me to change my way of cooking, I now will cook anything I’m able to get off the app, and make use of that. Then I’ll just use supermarkets to top up on necessities that I really need that I don’t get through the app.” Christina Davis, who is a teaching assistant, has noticed her food shop rise significantly. “I tend to look for the bargains when it comes to more expensive items, such as bread and meat,” she said. Davis has been particularly shocked by the rising price of coffee, meat, and oil in particular. “I don’t think the government and doing much to help ordinary people,” she said. “They’re just putting everything up, with gas and electricity and now food.”",News/Business,‘It’s ridiculous’: shock as some UK grocery prices rise by more than 20%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/21/uk-grocery-prices-rise-which
5/21/2022,"As one of the biggest and most influential garden shows on the planet, the RHS Chelsea flower show is a barometer of shifting trends within horticulture. It is no surprise, then, that many gardens at next week’s show – the first spring Chelsea since Covid – explores the theme of mental health. The positive effects of gardening on our wellbeing have long been recognised – as early as the sixth century, Benedictine monks viewed horticulture as grounding the mind – but in the past few years, this connection has come into sharper focus. Across the anxious lockdown months of 2020, it is estimated that three million new gardeners took to the trowel; healthcare-associated gardens like Maggie’s and Horatio’s are multiplying, while the NHS has recognised the restorative power of “green social prescribing” initiatives, connecting patients with hands-on gardening opportunities. I’ve lost count of gardening memoirs with a healing-through-horticulture narrative, but Sue Stuart-Smith’s 2020 bestseller, The Well Gardened Mind, confirms the science. Examining its miraculous effect on things like endorphin, serotonin and dopamine levels, and drawing on experiences as a psychotherapy clinician, Stuart-Smith explains how gardening helps alleviate depression and anxiety and boosts self-esteem. This year, some of Chelsea’s most prominent show gardens are engaging with the subject of mental health, including that of multiple “Best in Show” winner Andy Sturgeon. I asked a handful of designers collaborating with mental health charities about their gardens, and what we can do to create sanctuary within our own. “I was keen to do something meaningful,” says Sturgeon of his bold yet naturalistic show garden, which is intended as a sanctuary to facilitate conversation. “We were in the middle of the second lockdown, and I was acutely aware of the importance of people’s health. It seemed a good opportunity to put [mental health] on a platform in quite a big way at Chelsea.” Supported by Project Giving Back (PGB), a philanthropic scheme raising UK charity profiles by offering fully funded show gardens at Chelsea, Sturgeon has created the garden for the mental health advice and support charity Mind. The garden’s centrepiece is a series of curved walls made from textured clay render. “They enclose a seating area, crowd together in an almost uncomfortable way in the heart of the garden, then become lower and more open further down,” says Sturgeon. They represent some of the different aspects of mental health issues people experience, he says: “You might [experience] turmoil, or times where things are more calm and controlled.” The walls themselves are invitingly tactile. “‘Together’ is one of Mind’s brand values, and when you look at the garden you can see these walls all have relationships, almost as if they’re having a conversation,” says Sturgeon. His planting evokes a woodland edge, emerging from a stand of birch. “There’s a special quality of light and atmosphere you get in a birch forest – this is my kind of happy place.” In contrast with this area of dappled light and restful greens, the sunnier foreground exhibits more vibrant planting, where bright California poppy, bishop’s flower (Ammi spp.) and purple verbascums join autumn moor grass (Sesleria autumnalis) in casting shadows against the render. “The idea of different characters of planting puts rhythm into the design; if too much is going on everywhere it’s never restful, because your eye is darting around and your brain is active all the time.” Sturgeon’s walls also provides refuge. “The idea of enclosure is important,” he says. “You don’t want your neighbours all looking down on you, you want to be enclosed and protected, whether that’s by curved walls or hedges, or just through planting.” As part of the RHS’s collaboration with Project Giving Back, a brand-new category, All About Plants, is being launched within the show’s Great Pavilion this year, highlighting the power of plants. Debuting at Chelsea, counsellor-turned-garden designer Pollyanna Wilkinson has teamed up with charity Mothers for Mothers for her All About Plants garden, which supports women experiencing postnatal depression. Her design is a play on colour and mood, illustrating the transition from despair to hope. “One side is subdued greens and blues denoting depression and anxiety,” says Wilkinson. “Depression can sometimes be interpreted as anger turned inwards, so I’ve got little sparks of red [the crimson Dicentra formosa ‘Bacchanal’] representing flares of anger, which you can get as a new mum.” Then as you move through the garden, Wilkinson explains, the colours become more exuberant and joyful, representing the journey from illness to wellness. Here, the palette is “candy shop colours”, including plants like the peach-pink Iris “Big Squeeze” and the salmony Iris “Wondrous”; the apricot rose “The Lark Ascending”, and tall, lime-green angelica. “I haven’t been mentally unwell as a mother, but I had times where I felt extremely isolated. I found solace in the garden: at my darkest points I took myself outside – I couldn’t feel any stronger about the therapeutic benefits.” Wilkinson suggests thinking beyond colour when creating a garden for the mind, however. “It’s important to consider all the senses. I particularly love catmints and geranium leaves, which give off this gorgeous musty smell. And then bringing in anything with seed heads, which invite pollinators and birds.” Nature grounds you in the “now”, she explains: “Being able to see the solitary work of a little bee brings the mind to the present.” For his All About Plants contribution, Charlie Hawkes has ventured into the woods. His garden for the Wilderness Foundation – which helps people struggling with social challenges, grief and loss through positive experiences in wild nature – is inspired by forest environments. Visitors will follow a charred timber walkway below dense green planting: leafy disporums, polygonatums, aromatic phlox, pink Thalictrum “Black Stockings” and multi-stemmed Japanese zelkova trees. “Immersion is key,” says Hawkes. “I can’t recreate the ‘scale’ of wilderness at Chelsea, but I can dial up immersion and try to capture the setting in which the charity does their work.” After the show, Hawkes’s garden will be relocated to Henry Maynard Primary School in east London, where, he hopes, the intention of the garden will live on. Add colourLush greens are known to be calming, but floral colour has an uplifting effect. For Wilkinson, pastel-toned flowers are the most joyful, including peonies, Baptisia “Pink Trussella” and the light orange Verbascum “Clementine”. Grow your own herbsHerbs are multifaceted: their ornamental, aromatic, culinary and often “robust” nature appeal to several senses. The aroma of lavender is naturally calming, while according to Sue Stuart-Smith, going out to gather produce – picking mint or chamomile for tea, for example – can stimulate an energising dopamine release. Plant for wildlifePollinator-friendly plants, such as echinacea and rosemary, can be mentally nourishing, says designer Pollyanna Wilkinson. “One of my greatest joys is going out in the morning with a cup of tea and watching the bees – it brings [me] to the present.” SimplifySeparate areas of distinct character and atmosphere within the garden, for example, certain colour schemes or planting mixes, to avoid a “busyness” that can be distracting and uneasy on the eye. Just start …It is the “doing” of gardening that benefits us most: designer Charlie Hawkes suggests planting something – anything – to begin with. “People worry too much about their garden having to look the finished product from the start, but then freeze in the headlights when faced with 10,000 plants to choose from online. Just start; in 10 years you’ll have ended up in a very different place, but that’s all part of it.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Wellbeing secrets from the Chelsea flower show,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/21/wellbeing-secrets-from-the-chelsea-flower-show
