12/25/2021,"The developer of one of the world’s tallest towers has responded to a multi-million dollar lawsuit from the building’s condominium board over construction and alleged design defects that have resulted in floods, elevator malfunctions and electric explosions. The response, filed on Wednesday in New York state supreme court by an entity managed by Los Angeles-based CIM Group, said that the complaints against 432 Park Avenue in New York’s so-called Billionaire’s Row are “vastly exaggerated.” The developer also called the lawsuit “ill-advised” and argued that it was “an effort to wrest unwarranted payments”. In September, the condo board sued the tower’s developers, CIM Group and Macklowe Properties, for $125m in damages. The lawsuit includes costs to repair over 1,500 construction and design defects that were identified by an engineering firm hired by the board, along with other breakdowns and safety issues. “This case presents one of the worst examples of sponsor malfeasance in the development of a luxury condominium in the history of New York City,” said the complaint. The board complained about “horrible and obtrusive noise and vibrations” including creaking and clicking sounds in the building, which has 102 floors. It also said that trash that went through the trash chute sounded like a bomb detonation. According to the suit, the issues for certain residents were so serious that they were displaced from their units for as long as 19 months. The suit also detailed one incident in which a worker who tried to fix water infiltration issues allegedly drilled through concrete and into the tower’s electric wiring, resulting in an arc-flash explosion. The worker was allegedly thrown back several feet as a result of the explosion. Jonathan Adelsberg, a partner at the law firm Herrick Feinstein, which is representing the board, described the defects as “peeling an onion”, referring to ones that may yet be discovered. “This is a work in progress in ascertaining what’s wrong,” he told the New York Times in September. In its response to the lawsuit, the building’s developer said the building is “without a doubt safe.” “Like any other skyscraper, 432 Park’s sophisticated symphony of systems needed to be fine-tuned when residents began to move into the building,” it said. “But the board repeatedly and unlawfully prevented sponsor from accessing the building and finishing the job, all while manufacturing an ever-increasing list of demands,” the developer added in Wednesday’s court filing. Adelsberg responded to the developer’s filing, saying, according to the Wall Street Journal: “This is yet another attempt by the sponsor to shirk responsibility by rewriting the record of its malfeasance. We will continue to ensure that the sponsor is held accountable for their persistent failures.”",U.S./The Guardian,"New York mega-skyscraper ‘without a doubt safe’, developer says in response to lawsuit",https://news.yahoo.com/york-mega-skyscraper-without-doubt-135857980.html
12/25/2021,"Researchers may be in the early stages of discovering an effective strategy for inhibiting the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the results of a recent study. The results of the findings from David A. Ostrov, Ph.D., of the University of Florida, were published in Pathogens in late November. The report suggested that combining diphenhydramine — an antihistamine sold as Benadryl that is used for allergy symptoms — and lactoferrin — a protein found in cow and human milk — reduced replication of SARS-CoV-2 by 99% in lab tests on human lung and monkey cells. DR. NESHEIWAT: AUTHORIZED AT-HOME COVID-19 TREATMENT PILLS ARE A ‘BLESSING’ ""We found out why certain drugs are active against the virus that causes COVID-19,"" Ostrov told the University of Florida Health Newsroom. ""Then, we found an antiviral combination that can be effective, economical and has a long history of safety."" Key to the research team’s findings was the focus on sigma receptors, which are proteins expressed in human cells. COVID-19 ""hijacks"" the body’s stress-response machinery, including these receptors, so it can replicate inside its host. Interfering with that process is key to inhibiting the virus’s potency, according to the researchers. ""We know the detailed mechanism of how certain drugs inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" Ostrov said. The research, however, is preliminary, and Ostrov has cautioned against self-medicating with either diphenhydramine or lactoferrin for COVID-19 prevention. Lactoferrin is available commercially to treat stomach and intestinal ulcers but differs slightly from the type used in the experiment, Ostrov said.",Health/Fox News,Early-stage research suggests a milk protein combined with Benadryl may help fight COVID-19,https://news.yahoo.com/early-stage-research-suggests-milk-002425317.html
12/25/2021,"Trump spokesperson Taylor Budowich said that he's turned over 1,700 documents to the Jan. 6 committee. Budowich added that he has testified for ""roughly four hours."" Budowich is suing the committee to prevent them from accessing his financial records from JP Morgan. Former President Donald Trump's spokesperson Taylor Budowich revealed in a new court filing that he provided the House select committee investigating the events of January 6, 2021, with at least 1,700 pages of documents and sat for ""roughly four hours of sworn testimony,"" according to court documents reviewed by Insider and first reported on by Politico's Kyle Cheney. Budowich and Conservative Strategies, Inc. are suing the Jan. 6 committee, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, JP Morgan, and other individual members of the committee over a subpoena for his financial records from JP Morgan. The suit was filed on December 24 in the US District Court for the District of Columbia. He is arguing that the move is a violation of the Financial Privacy Act. According to the filings, Budowich ""answered questions, concerning payments made and received regarding his involvement in the planning of a peaceful, lawful rally to celebrate President Trump's accomplishments."" In late November, the committee issued subpoenas to Trump loyalists including Budowich and Alex Jones, for their alleged roles in Jan. 6. According to a letter from the House select committee, members of the committee wanted to question Budowich about funding for a 501(c)(4) promoting the January 6 rally, where Trump spoke, the preceded the Capitol riot.

12/25/2021,"NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. health officials are warning the public not to eat certain brands of packaged salads, which they say are linked to two small, long-running listeria outbreaks in which three people died. One outbreak is linked to packaged salads produced by Fresh Express and another has been tied to packaged salads produced by Dole. The outbreaks are caused by different strains of listeria bacteria and there's no known link between them, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Thursday. In the outbreak linked to Fresh Express, ten people in eight states were identified in the outbreak between 2016 and late October of this year. All were hospitalized and one person, in Pennsylvania, died. This week, Fresh Express recalled several brands of packaged salad products with product codes Z324 through Z350. The CDC is telling people not to eat, sell, or serve any recalled products. A separate outbreak caused by a different strain was found on two Dole packaged salads. In that outbreak, 16 people in 13 states infected with the listeria strain have been reported between August 2014 and mid-October of this year. That includes 12 who were hospitalized and two — in Michigan and Wisconsin — who died. Dole recalled several brands of packaged salads this week with “best if used by” dates from Nov. 30 to Jan. 8. It's not known where the listeria originated in either outbreak, but it's a hardy bacteria that can linger on surfaces in production facilities or other places, officials say. Listeria symptoms usually start one to four weeks after eating contaminated food, but can start as soon as the same day. ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.
