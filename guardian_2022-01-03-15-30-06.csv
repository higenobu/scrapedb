1/3/2022," After a recent inquest found infuriatingly major police failings in the case, here is the first episode in a three-part drama about the four victims of the rapist and murderer Stephen Port. Sheridan Smith plays Sarah Sak, who wrote a book about the circumstances around her son’s death, while Stephen Merchant sheds his funny bone to step into an uncomfortably sinister role. Although the programme is bleak in subject, the makers spoke with the families of the victims to make sure their stories were told correctly. Hollie Richardson At a time of year when many of us are reassessing our diets, here comes a special edition of the foodie science format. The information buffet includes Briony May Williams investigating why gluten-free products often come at a premium, Jimmy Doherty pondering the health benefits of chia seeds – and a look at raw dog food (for consumption by pets, not humans). Graeme Virtue “Dubai is somewhere that, y’know, you can enjoy your wealth.” Meet highly unrelatable Gaynor Scott, who splits her time between mansions in Dubai and Jersey. Some will find this look at life in the shoes of Scott and her fellow expats in the Monaco of the Middle East guiltily moreish. Others might well be repulsed immediately.

1/3/2022,"If the clouds cooperate, you can start the year with a meteor shower. The Quadrantid meteor shower reaches its peak activity on or about 3 January each year. This year, the peak has been estimated to occur at about 10pm GMT, although this can vary by a day or so.  The shower produces meteors in the sky any time between 28 December and 12 January. It is known for creating blue meteors with occasional fireballs and under ideal conditions can produce more than 100 meteors an hour. Yet, as fleeting as it is unpredictable, the peak is often over in a matter of hours. This year visibility is helped because the moon is new and will have set before the show starts, removing a source of illumination that masks the fainter meteors. To further enhance your chances, find the darkest sky you can and wrap up warm. Watching meteors is a waiting game. The chart shows the view looking north-east from London at midnight GMT on Monday. Do not look directly at the radiant, instead look off to one side. The best view will be in the hours after midnight, before dawn.

Waves up to 9 metres were recorded off Brisbane and Tweed Heads, according to government wave monitoring buoys, while the Bureau of Meteorology issued a hazardous surf warning for the state.  The ex-tropical cyclone is generating swells that are affecting the south-east coast of Queensland and the north coast of New South Wales, with residents advised to stay away from beaches.

That, combined with tides above their highest astronomical point, made conditions dangerous. “It’s quite dangerous, with sea levels higher than you’d expect, plus the waves, leading to a very dangerous situation,” she told Guardian Australia. “It’s almost like a storm surge coming through, with the regular tide high due to the cycle of the moon, and the ex-tropical cyclone, resulting in places that will be inundated.” Crazy surf at Caloundra this morning. #KingsBeach #thisisqueensland #CycloneSeth pic.twitter.com/AHPxBmDnE9 Reid said it was “very dangerous” to go swimming but expected conditions to ease over the coming days. “We are expecting conditions to continue over the next 24 hours, but as the system moves slightly west, it might help, it is weakening as it drifts west.” The storm was expected to become a tropical low by the time it moved towards land later on Monday. “It will make life difficult for the coastline, definitely, but it is likely to weaken and not be classed as a tropical cyclone by the time we get to late Monday,” Reid said.

1/3/2022,"Here’s the latest in a long line of authorised-version sports documentaries that gives plenty of elbow room for the legend in question to explain themselves, and friends and family to add their admiring two-penn’orth. Shane Warne, Australia’s leading wicket taker in Tests, and second in the all-time list to Sri Lanka’s Muttiah Muralitharan, makes for an engaging enough subject as he holds forth on his exceptional cricketing career, making honest points about the top-class sportsperson’s ability to block out everything else when necessary, and the consequent damage it does to off-field relationships. Warne burst into the international arena in the 1990s; the odd combination of spin-bowling guile and beach-bum persona making him an instant star. There’s some good stuff on the techniques that he employed that made his bowling so deadly, and he repeats the allegation, in some detail, that Pakistan captain Salim Malik offered him $200,000 to throw a match. (In 2000 Malik was banned for match-fixing, partly on Warne’s evidence.) On the other hand, Warne is a little less forthcoming on his own sporting troubles: being fined for providing information to a bookmaker in 1994 and a 12-month suspension in 2003 for taking a banned diuretic.  Otherwise, this profile skimps a little on the actual cricket – perhaps inevitable when Warne clearly wants to work through the personal stuff – and Warne being Warne, there’s a bit too much pointless comment from celebrity know-nothings such as Ed Sheeran and Chris Martin. On the other hand, Merv Hughes, looking more than ever like a Viking chieftain waiting for his shield-bearer, comes up with some great lines, including comparing Warne to King Kong. Warne no doubt intended the film to shore up his bloody-good-bloke image, and in this he’s got to be satisfied how it’s turned out.

1/3/2022,"The BBC newsreader George Alagiah has said he feels lucky for the life he has lived even though cancer will “probably get me in the end”. Alagiah, 66, was first diagnosed with stage four bowel cancer in April 2014, which subsequently spread to his lungs, liver and lymph nodes, and he announced in October he was taking a break from his presenting duties as he deals with “a further spread of cancer”.  In a conversation with Craig Oliver, a former Downing Street director of communications, Alagiah discussed living with the disease. “I don’t think I’m going to be able to get rid of this thing. I’ve got the cancer still. It’s growing very slowly,” he said in an interview for Oliver’s podcast, Desperately Seeking Wisdom. “My doctor’s very good at every now and again hitting me with a big red bus full of drugs, because the whole point about cancer is it bloody finds a way through and it gets you in the end. “Probably … it will get me in the end. I’m hoping it’s a long time from now, but I’m very lucky.” The presenter said he would never wish he had cancer, but he would not give back the years he had lived with it because he had learned so much. He added his cancer diagnosis had helped him to figure out what was important in his life. “I had to stop and say, ‘Hang on a minute. If the full stop came now, would my life have been a failure?’ “And actually, when I look back and I looked at my journey … the family I had, the opportunities my family had, the great good fortune to bump into [Frances Robathan], who’s now been my wife and lover for all these years, the kids that we brought up … it didn’t feel like a failure.” Alagiah was born in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and attended primary school in Ghana before attending secondary school in Portsmouth and studying at Durham university. He joined the BBC in 1989 and, before becoming a presenter, worked as a foreign correspondent, reporting on events including the Rwandan genocide, and interviewing Nelson Mandela and Archbishop Desmond Tutu in his role as a specialist on Africa and the developing world. Asked what piece of wisdom he would give, he said: “I think it would be to constantly ask the question, ‘What is it we can do together?’ “I spent a lot of my time in Africa, and in South Africa they have a word: ubuntu. It’s the idea that I’m only human if I recognise the humanity in you. There’s this collective notion of life which I think we have lost.” The podcast episode is released on 3 January.",News/Media,"Cancer will probably get me in the end, says George Alagiah",https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/03/cancer-will-probably-get-me-in-the-end-says-george-alagiah
1/3/2022,"The US could be under a rightwing dictatorship by 2030, a Canadian political science professor has warned, urging his country to protect itself against the “collapse of American democracy”.  “We mustn’t dismiss these possibilities just because they seem ludicrous or too horrible to imagine,” Thomas Homer-Dixon, founding director of the Cascade Institute at Royal Roads University in British Columbia, wrote in the Globe and Mail. “In 2014, the suggestion that Donald Trump would become president would also have struck nearly everyone as absurd. But today we live in a world where the absurd regularly becomes real and the horrible commonplace.” Homer-Dixon’s message was blunt: “By 2025, American democracy could collapse, causing extreme domestic political instability, including widespread civil violence. By 2030, if not sooner, the country could be governed by a rightwing dictatorship.” The author cited eventualities centered on a Trump return to the White House in 2024, possibly including Republican-held state legislatures refusing to accept a Democratic win. Trump, he warned, “will have only two objectives, vindication and vengeance” of the lie that his 2020 defeat by Joe Biden was the result of electoral fraud. A “scholar of violent conflict” for more than four decades, Homer-Dixon said Canada must take heed of the “unfolding crisis”. “A terrible storm is coming from the south, and Canada is woefully unprepared. Over the past year we’ve turned our attention inward, distracted by the challenges of Covid-19, reconciliation and the accelerating effects of climate change. “But now we must focus on the urgent problem of what to do about the likely unraveling of democracy in the United States. We need to start by fully recognising the magnitude of the danger. If Mr Trump is re-elected, even under the more optimistic scenarios the economic and political risks to our country will be innumerable.” Homer-Dixon said he even saw a scenario in which a new Trump administration, having effectively nullified internal opposition, deliberately damaged its northern neighbor. “Under the less-optimistic scenarios, the risks to our country in their cumulative effect could easily be existential, far greater than any in our federation’s history. What happens, for instance, if high-profile political refugees fleeing persecution arrive in our country and the US regime demands them back. Do we comply?” Trump, he said, “and a host of acolytes and wannabes such as Fox [News]’s Tucker Carlson and Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene”, had transformed the Republican party “into a near-fascist personality cult that’s a perfect instrument for wrecking democracy”. Worse, he said, Trump “may be just a warm-up act”. “Returning to office, he’ll be the wrecking ball that demolishes democracy but the process will produce a political and social shambles,” Homer-Dixon said. “Still, through targeted harassment and dismissal, he’ll be able to thin the ranks of his movement’s opponents within the state, the bureaucrats, officials and technocrats who oversee the non-partisan functioning of core institutions and abide by the rule of law. “Then the stage will be set for a more managerially competent ruler, after Mr Trump, to bring order to the chaos he’s created.”",News/US news,"US could be under rightwing dictator by 2030, Canadian professor warns",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/03/us-rightwing-dictatorship-2030-trump-canada
1/3/2022,"It’s an encouraging start to 2022. In an informal census – or perhaps a sort of watery award ceremony – the Wildlife Trusts’ marine review of 2021 has pointed to humpback whales off the north-east coast of Scotland and England, increasing numbers of seal pups being born, and seahorses in protected beds of eel grass off the Dorset coast. It seems the work of the trusts and other marine conservation bodies is having a good effect. Blue whales appearing in the Irish Sea may be physical beneficiaries of the general agreement of the International Whaling Commission in 1982, effected three years later, to halt the cull of the species. It is as if the whales themselves remember, encouraged to return without fear of someone sticking a harpoon in them.  But in many ways these optimistic signs are also the markers of what we have lost. In the 19th century the waterways of the Solent were so full of salmon that local apprentices, according to one author writing in 1850, “stipulated in their indentures that it should not be served up to them oftener than three times a-week”. The same author reported shoals of porpoises in Southampton Water, “rolling and springing on the surface in their renewed gambols”. While in the 18th century, Oliver Goldsmith reported on an English Channel filled with whales, dolphins, cod fish, tuna and even great white sharks chasing columns of herrings. “The whole water seems alive,” Goldsmith wrote in one of the first popular science books, Animated Nature, in 1776, “and is seen so black with them that the number seems inexhaustible.” Humans, too, were once more watery. In the north of England and Scotland, fisherwomen were known as herring quines, so covered were they in silvery scales they seemed to be becoming fish themselves. Charles Richard Weld of the Royal Society declared in 1859, riffing on Darwin: “If a man may become a monkey, or has been a whale, why should not a Caithness damsel become a herring?” To these writers, the idea that one day there might not be plenty more fish in the sea would have been unthinkable. The depredations of the natural world that began to accelerate in the 19th century would remove much of that marine biomass from around our shores, with disastrous effects. The physical absence of the great whales such as blue, fin, humpback and sperm whales may have actually accelerated the climate crisis – because it deprived the oceanic food chain of their fertilising faeces, and their rotting carcasses which, on the sea bed, helped sequester carbon from the ecosphere and sustain species, from polar bears and seals to bone-eating osedax worms. The life cycles of smaller organisms depended entirely on carcasses. We look to science to point out what needs to be done, but often art inspires as much as academic reports. In 2012, Heather Ackroyd and Dan Harvey performed a kind of reincarnation on the skeleton of a minke whale stranded at Skegness by growing diamond-like chemical crystals on its bones. A year later, the artists Ellen Gallagher and Edgar Cleijne used the bone-eating worm to conjure up a similarly alchemical transformation in their film, Osedax: a dead whale slowly sways to the bottom to become, in the words of Shakespeare’s Ariel in The Tempest, “something rich and strange”. With its shapeshifting sense of gender (slipper snails form stacks upon each other, changing sex from male at the bottom to female at the top) and of time (“shadow” parts of the ocean may be 1,000 years old), the sea defies all our assumptions. It is a decidedly queer place; just ask any dolphin. Nor does it recognise national boundaries, of course. The sea is where our laws and jurisdictions run out. That inevitably raises contrary questions of responsibility and freedom. Indeed, it is hard to divorce the threats to our native marine life from “alien species” without considering the human refugees arriving on those same shores. Or to note that the climate crisis is a driver for both. It is easy to ignore the sea, or to think of it as a kind of highway with a fish shop attached. Some may consider it bizarre that commentators such as George Monbiot call for a rewilding of our seas as well as of the land. Others may worry there’s no chance of that while English and French politicians squabble over who has the “right” to take fish from the sea. But humpbacks off Whitby? Dancing sea slugs off Cumbria? White-beaked dolphins off Essex? These may be anomalies or signs of disruption, but merely bearing witness to such wonders has the power to restore our faith. As I swim in the chilly winter sea, the sleek black head of a grey seal pops up beside me, and in the louring grey sky a skein of brent geese, charcoal-coloured visitors from Siberia, steer into view. It’s not quite Goldsmith’s vision of Eden, but I’m still hoping for miracles in 2022. Happy new year to the sea, all its species, and to all of you.

1/3/2022,"An appeal has been issued for women to stand as councillors in the Western Isles in 2022 in an effort to end the Hebridean islands’ unwelcome status as the only Scottish authority with an all-male council. Islanders and equality campaigners were stunned in 2017 when none of the seven women who stood were elected for the Western Isles. Only one, an incumbent, came close to winning a seat in the 31-member authority.  Alarmed officials on Comhairle nan Eilean Siar, Gaelic for the Western Isles council, are staging an online workshop in January to persuade more women to stand in May’s elections, in concert with Elect Her, a group specialising in combating gender inequalities in government. Nearly 20 women have signed up for the workshop, and for many involved it has raised deeper questions for the authority, its leadership and the community as a whole. Western Isles has been the only all-male council in Scotland, and possibly the UK, for nearly five years. “It’s always concerning when a large sector of the population is unrepresented,” said Malcolm Burr, the council’s chief executive. “When our all-male comhairle was elected in 2017, we thought: this isn’t wholly representative of the community, what should we do about it?” Paradoxically, voting rates for Western Isles council elections are among the highest in Scotland. Women are prominent and influential leaders in community and business life, yet only a handful ever win seats. The peak was five in 2007. Few stand for election. One barrier is the ban on council employees being elected to the same authority, to prevent conflicts of interest. On the mainland, councillors can work for a neighbouring authority; in the Outer Hebrides, that is impractical. Western Isles council is the largest employer, with 2,185 staff for a population of 26,500; in many roles, most employees are women. Burr said the rules now allowed a council employee to stand for election. But they would have to quit their council job if they won, exchanging the security of a career, fixed hours and a public-sector salary for the £18,604 a councillor earned, with no guarantee of re-election. Zena Stewart, a former councillor who topped her ward’s election in 2012, only stood after retiring from the Nicolson Institute, the secondary school for Lewis, partly for that reason. “If you’re being paid as a councillor, there’s more asked of you,” she said. “I had to attend every meeting unless there was an obvious reason why I couldn’t.” Katie Laing, a part-time teacher, journalist and vice-convener of Stornoway community council, said that was a significant obstacle, in particular for women with children. In addition, a large majority of Western Isles councillors traditionally stand as independents, limiting the scope for positively discriminating in favour of female candidates – a strategy routinely used by political parties in mainland elections. Campaigners say that amplifies the importance of already powerful institutions such as the church – candidates known to local congregations have a ready-made electorate, and men dominate many Hebridean churches. Stewart said councillors connected to churches often won because they had earned respect; the same could apply to golf club leaders. Agnes Rennie, a community leader who also won election in later life, said councillors were expected to be present at key community events, involving long distances and late evenings away from home. For women with families, that burden could be onerous. “You are measured against whether you’re there or not,” she said. For some women, there was the perception council life was unjustifiably combative and toxic, said Laing, particularly in a small island community where conformity could be harshly policed. Rennie said much greater emphasis on flexible meeting times, video conferencing and policies allowing absences for those with family responsibilities was needed. So, too, were visible role models so “women can imagine themselves in that role. It’s a big step for many people,” she said. A long tradition of community leadership and voluntary work meant women “have tremendous skills and experience that would bring so much to the role; I have no doubt women bring a different perspective”, she said.",News/UK news,Western Isles looks to end stigma of being Scotland’s only all-male council,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/03/western-isles-scotland-all-male-council-workshop-women
1/3/2022,"More than 440,000 small firms could be forced out of business by the late payment “crisis”, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, which has called for urgent government intervention to improve the way firms are paid. Almost a third of small businesses (30%) surveyed told the FSB that they had seen the late payment of invoices increase over the last three months, with at least 8% warning that the problem has become so bad that it was threatening the viability of their business.  For years the problem of late payments – often by big FTSE firms – has dogged the small business sector. Firms are often forced to pay their suppliers, wages and other bills on time, but face long waits to be paid themselves. The FSB said more than 400,000 small firms have shut down since the start of the pandemic for various reasons, and that the future of a similar number is now threatened by this problem alone. “Late payment was destroying thousands of small businesses even before the pandemic hit – the pandemic has made matters worse,” said the FSB national chair, Mike Cherry. “In the past, the government has rightly identified greater board accountability as key to spurring change in this area, but delivery has been slow.” Cherry said small firms, which employ more than 13 million workers in the UK, are facing battles on almost every front, including new customs checks on imports from the EU and looming energy cost crisis. “Today, it’s a fresh wave of admin for importers and exporters – in three months’ time it will be a hike to the jobs tax, that is national insurance contributions, a rise in dividend taxation, business rates bills and an increase in the national living wage. On top of that, operating costs are surging – many will soon be trying to strike energy deals without the clout of big corporates or the protections afforded to consumers.” The FSB has said every big business and government organisation should be abiding by the prompt payment code arguing that 30-day payment terms should be “the norm for those who are committed to environmental, social and governance best practice”. It wants every big UK corporation to have a non-executive director on its board with direct responsibility for payment culture. The other findings of the FSB survey of more than 1,200 members will concern ministers. More small firms now expect their performance to worsen over the coming three months than expect an improvement. Pessimism is especially pronounced in the retail, accommodation and food industries, as many UK consumers adopted self-imposed lockdowns in the face of Omicron. Pictures of deserted high streets in the run-up to Christmas, fears over spiralling energy costs and concerns that staff will not be able return to work on Tuesday have not helped matters. Spiralling energy bills have already forced some firms to close. Businesses are not protected by the price cap imposed by the regulator Ofgem. Companies importing goods from the EU also now face new, onerous paperwork. Regulations require businesses (in most cases those receiving goods in the UK, but in some those sending them to the UK) to notify the customs authorities of precisely what is being sent to Great Britain from the EU, and from where. The rules were in effect waived throughout 2021 but now apply for the first time. A Government spokesman said: “The Government is making significant reforms to help small businesses get paid on time, including halving the payment period in the prompt payment code and consulting on fines and other new powers for the Small Business Commissioner.” “There is plenty of support available to ensure small businesses are well positioned to comply with UK border processes, including one-to-one advice through the Export Support Service.”",News/Business,"UK’s late payment ‘crisis’ risks future of 440,000 small firms",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/03/uks-late-payment-crisis-risks-future-of-440000-small-firms
1/3/2022,"Popular lockdown pursuits such as cooking, DIY and buying pets led to thousands of people needing hospital care for injuries, figures suggest. Analysis of hospital admissions in England by the PA Media news agency showed that thousands were treated for injuries sustained as a result of activities that surged in popularity as people were confined to their homes.  The data from NHS Digital for 2020-21 showed that more than 5,600 people attended hospital after coming into contact with a powered hand-tool, and more than 2,700 were admitted after an accident with a non-powered hand-tool such as a hammer or a saw. Figures also showed that 349 people were admitted after injuring themselves with lawnmowers. More than 5,300 people were admitted after falling from playground equipment, with the average age of patients being nine and a half years. However, some parents and grandparents were involved as well, with dozens of people over the age of 30 admitted after falling from playground equipment, including eight people over the age of 90. Data showed that 962 people were treated in hospital for injuries sustained while climbing trees. Lockdowns also triggered a “pet baby boom” with data from the Pet Food Manufacturers’ Association in March showing that 3.2m households in the UK had acquired a pet since the start of the pandemic. These new animals did not always bring joy, however, as 7,386 people were admitted to English hospitals after being bitten or struck by a dog, along with 47 people suffering a rat bite, and 60 people who had come into contact with a venomous spider. Four people were admitted after coming into contact with a scorpion. Many people turned their hand to improving their cooking skills, and admissions data showed that 2,243 needed to be admitted after coming into contact with hot drinks, food, fats and cooking oils. Although many were grateful for the sunny weather in the first lockdown, 153 people were admitted to hospital with sunburn. The figures only include people who were admitted to hospital, and many more injuries would have been dealt with by A&E doctors and GPs. The figures for most accidents and injuries were lower than in previous years as people generally spent more time indoors. A spokesperson for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said: “The publication of hospital admission figures always serves to remind us of the breadth of accident types that can result in an injury so severe that admission to hospital is required. In among the stranger entries in the database are some worrying trends that serve to highlight the accident challenges that we face. Accidents are preventable.”",News/Society,"Lockdown hobbies led to thousands of injuries in England, NHS data suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/03/lockdown-hobbies-led-to-thousands-of-injuries-in-england-nhs-data-suggests
1/3/2022,"The world’s oldest person has celebrated her 119th birthday in Japan, saying she is determined to extend the record by another year. Kane Tanaka, who has a weakness for fizzy drinks and chocolate, marked the milestone on Sunday with staff at the nursing home where she lives in Fukuoka prefecture, south-west Japan, according to media reports.  The Guinness Book of Records recognised Tanaka’s status in March 2019, when she was 116; she went on to achieve an all-time Japanese age record when she reached 117 years and 261 days in September 2020. Born in 1903 – the year the Wright brothers made their first powered flight and the first Tour de France was held – Tanaka has lived through five Japanese imperial reigns and has set her sights on reaching her 120th birthday, the Kyodo news agency quoted family members as saying. Tanaka, who was born six months before George Orwell, is one of a large and growing number of Japanese centenarians. In an estimate released in September ahead of the annual Respect for the Aged Day, the health ministry said a record 86,510 people were aged 100 or older, an increase of 6,060 from the previous year. Women make up the vast majority of centenarians, with men accounting for just over 10,000, the ministry said. When the annual survey was first conducted in 1963, Japan had just 153 centenarians, but the number had soared to over 10,000 by 1998. Life expectancy in Japan, one of the fastest-ageing societies on earth, is also at a record high, at 87.74 for women and 81.64 for men. The number of young people is shrinking, however, amid failed attempts to raise the country’s low birth rate. Government figures showed that 1.2 million people saw in the New Year as new adults – those who had turned 20 – a drop of 40,000 from last year and the lowest number since records were first kept in 1968. Twenty-year-olds have accounted for less than 1% of the country’s population for the past 12 years, public broadcaster NHK said. When Tanaka became Japan’s oldest person on record she celebrated with a bottle of Coke – her favourite drink – and made a peace sign for photographers. While visiting restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic means she has had limited contact with family members, she reportedly uses gestures to communicate with nursing home staff and is keen on puzzles and board games. The seventh of nine siblings, Tanaka married when she was 19 and helped run the family’s noodle shop after her husband and eldest son went to fight in the second Sino-Japanese war, which began in 1937.

One senior specialist said “even the most routine urgent treatment” was already being cancelled to divert resources to Covid. “People will die,” he said.  The state’s chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, repeated on Monday that the health system remained “very well placed” to cope with rising hospitalisation rates. The number of patients in intensive care units (ICU) rose 14% in the previous 24 hours with more than 20,000 new Covid cases again reported in NSW. Privately, though, doctors and nurses who are not authorised to speak publicly say the health system is close to capacity. “No way will the health system cope,” said the senior specialist. “It’s never been this bad.” The senior doctor said the focus on staff shortages overlooked the issue that all the state’s major hospitals were rapidly approaching bed capacity. At the current rate “every single bed will only be for Covid patients … it doesn’t matter how many staff they call back”. A nurse at a major hospital, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that while her centre still had spare beds, there were “huge gaps in staffing”. Lung and heart transplant patients were among those who were not getting the care they would have just two years ago, the nurse with almost a decade’s experience said. “People are turning up really unwell,” she said. “They are staying 40, 50, 60 hours” in emergency wards while they wait for capacity to be made available. “We don’t have enough staff to spread around,” the nurse said. “It’s just been brushed under the floor … we’re shocked.” At Liverpool hospital, one of Sydney’s major medical centres in the city’s south-west, five general wards and two ICU wards had already been set aside for Covid patients. The main emergency department waiting room on Monday was full with would-be patients who were spilling out into the street, with one young woman vomiting into a plastic bag as she waited to be seen. Staff were not permitted to speak to the media. Guardian Australia was told no hospital official would be commenting, and was politely asked to leave the hospital premises. Among those waiting in the 30C heat, though, was a mother and her two daughters from Padstow Heights, about 17km away from Liverpool. One daughter had Covid symptoms and the trio had been waiting for more than an hour outside the emergency department to see a doctor. They had already tried unsuccessfully to get tested at three other public sites. Alex Kanazir had waited four hours by early afternoon to have his 70-year-old mother treated for stomach pains. A month earlier, when his mum had broken her arm, they had only waited an hour before she was admitted, and spent five days in a ward. One concern for those facing lengthy delays was the added risk of contracting Covid, even if that was not the prompt for the visit. “It’s catch-22,” Kanazir said, adding visitors to the emergency department were warned there had already been at least one Covid case that morning. Emergency patients at the hospital would ideally wait no more than four hours before being moved to appropriate wards. The current wait can be a day or more, one staffer said. The nurse from another major hospital said general staff fatigue was on the rise and it was inevitable many experienced health workers would leave the industry. “I think we’re going to see mass resignations,” she said. “This isn’t the way the health system should work.”",News/Australia news,‘People will die’: doctors warn Covid surge is filling up NSW hospitals,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/03/people-will-die-doctors-warn-covid-surge-is-filling-up-nsw-hospitals
1/3/2022,"The Hong Kong independent news outlet Citizen News has said it will cease operations from Tuesday in the face of what it described as a deteriorating media environment in the Chinese-ruled city and to ensure the safety of its staff. “Regrettably, the rapid changes in society and worsening environment for media make us unable to achieve our goal fearlessly. Amid this crisis, we have to first make sure everyone on the boat is safe,” Citizen News, which was established in 2017, said in a statement.  At a press conference on Monday, Citizen News chief editor Daisy Li said the environment had changed, and she didn’t know what “safe” news was any more. “If I am no longer confident enough to guide and lead my reporters, I must be responsible,” she said. The decision to close Citizen News was triggered by the early morning police raid of Hong Kong’s Stand News last week, Chris Yeung, chief writer at Citizen News and former president of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, told reporters on Monday. “We could not rule out that … we might be exposed to some risks,” Yeung said. “Reporting fearlessly means we aren’t afraid of offending the political elite, we criticise the authorities when their policies aren’t right, we don’t shy from covering corporations due to business pressure,” he said, according to local media. “But it doesn’t mean we should have to sacrifice our freedom as a price.” Last week hundreds of police raided the Stand News newsroom, and two former senior editors of the outlet, including popstar Denise Ho, were charged with conspiring to publish seditious materials and denied bail. The UN and media watchdogs CPJ and RSF condemned the crackdown as an attack on press freedom. “The government is abusing a draconian colonial law that has not been used for more than FIVE decades to prosecute journalists,” said exiled activist and former politician, Nathan Law. It followed last year’s enforced closure of Apple Daily and the arrest of several journalists and executives last year, and a government-led overhaul of the operations of public broadcaster RTHK. Pro-democracy activists and rights groups say freedoms promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, including freedom of the press, have been increasingly eroded since Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020. Hong Kong authorities have repeatedly rejected accusations they are eroding rights and freedoms, and the city’s government denies targeting the media. In an interview with China News Agency on Monday, security secretary Chris Tang lauded his bureau’s arrests of “anti-China agitators”, singling out the “cessation” of Apple Daily as the most impressive, the Standard reported. In its description on Facebook, Citizen News says it has no party affiliation and aims to promote Hong Kong’s core values, such as those of freedom, openness, diversity and inclusion. In a farewell message of thanks to its readers, the outlet said it had launched hoping “to serve the public and greater public good”. “We may not be the fastest or the most productive outlets in town but our team, with veterans and young journalists, stand united to publish truthful news reporting with depth,” it said. “We all love this place deeply. Regrettably, what was ahead of us is not just pouring rains or blowing winds, but hurricanes and tsunamis.” The Hong Kong Journalists Association said it was deeply saddened by the closures of the two outlets, and that the impact the crackdown on press would have on Hong Kong’s reputation was hard to describe.",News/World news,Hong Kong’s Citizen News to close citing fears for staff safety,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/02/hong-kong-citizen-news-close-fears-staff-safety
1/3/2022,"Ahead of me at the far end of the path, just where it drops into the next valley, the wind has corralled a drift of dry leaves between the hedgerows. It fills the space behind the gate almost ankle deep, so that opening it sweeps a quadrant clear to mark my passage. The air is still and cold, the grass fringed with lines of frost, distant sounds seem unusually close at hand. Ivy weaves across the bank below the beech wood, bright green against the dead brash of the woodland floor, with early light reflecting from the glossy cuticles of the leaves.  I pause and look eastwards along the valley of the Afon Rheidol. A few sheep look up from the pasture before realising I’m not carrying anything remotely edible – certainly not a rattling bag of grass nuts – and return to their stolid routine. A thin mist hangs between the trees that mark the course of the river, fading into the veil of haze which softens the distant hills. The sun has finally climbed above the horizon, but is still low in the sky – and a single red kite beats across the hillside in its search for breakfast. At the end of each pass the kite makes a sharp right-hand turn, the sun lighting up the russet of its underside as it wheels around. After the recent storms I’m relieved to see an old friend has survived. An ancient tree, split by time and weather into multiple trunks, and with an almost fractal crown, stands resolutely at the end of the hedgerow. Sheltered from the north and west by the steep hillside, only a scattering of twigs have fallen since I was last here, so the outline of the tree against the light retains its barely balanced complexity. I wander on down the lane under the bare chestnut trees, looking across at the field where gorse has begun to invade the lightly grazed pasture. Even at the turning of the year the gorse is, as usual, in flower – a scattering of yellow gently lit by the milky sunshine.
