1/19/2022,"Most of primary school teacher Kate Locke’s salary goes on her rent – and in the last month, that’s gone up by 10%. Combined with the rising costs of food and energy, Locke, 39, is increasingly worried about money. “By end of month I’m in my overdraft, I haven’t been able to save anything – there’s no stability,” Locke, who lives in Reading, says.  “Food costs have gone up over the last six months – but it’s in the last two months that I’ve been really worried about if I can afford things. Before this I never had much money but now I’m not getting through the month.” Locke, who is a single parent with a teenage son, says her energy bills have risen steeply. “Since Christmas, my bills have gone up by £47 to around £110,” she says. “We use hot-water bottles in the evening to avoid putting on the heating. My son was off school with Covid recently and there was a real rise in bills – we shouldn’t have to worry about getting our children warm.” She used to shop at Sainsbury’s, but lives by a Waitrose and would “nip across the road” for the odd item. “That’s not an option any more,” Locke says. She’s switched to Lidl. “Now I’m really thoughtful about what I spend my money on. I’m really feeling the pinch more than ever before.” Julie, a retired teacher and novelist in Arbroath, is “scrutinising” her bills as she’s noticed a steep rise in costs. Her food shop has risen by a third compared with six months ago, and her energy bills have doubled in the same period. “I fully expect that any pension increase won’t cover price rises – and it’s time to start cutting back,” she says. Julie, who gets a fortnightly shop delivered from Asda, has noticed price increases in items like cheese and coffee: “Good quality instant coffee has doubled, and is no longer on special offer.” She’s also noticed a large increase in the price of dried goods, such as crackers: they used to be 50p and are now 90p. “Items that were price-matching with Lidl have gone way up at Asda,” she says. The 63-year-old doesn’t buy meat or fish from the supermarket – “you’re not going to get better local produce than here” – and notes that local businesses have not raised their prices. While ordinarily Julie would have bought new clothes in the January sales, this year is different. “This year I don’t intend to buy anything I strictly don’t need,” she says. “I’m not going clothes shopping, and I’m buying books on Kindle rather than physical books.” She adds: “There are some things I’m saying: ‘you don’t need that, don’t even think about it.’ I’m scrutinising the twice-a-month supermarket shopping to look for savings where possible.” To Gavin Waugh, a 46-year-old store manager in Fort William, rising petrol prices have been particularly alarming. “It’s very noticeable in the Highlands: our pricing in Fort William is more than other places,” he says. “What’s frustrating is you can go to Inverness, 66 miles away, and the prices are much cheaper, up to 8p cheaper per litre. It just feels like because we are a very touristy destination area, the locals are penalised by that.” Waugh lives close to his workplace so isn’t spending too much on commuting, but says some of his employees who live 20 miles away have been seriously affected. “Right now, it’s £1.49 [a litre] in Morrisons, which is the cheapest. I’ve been away a week and it’s just gone up a penny. A year ago [it was] at £1.30, if not £1.20 – quite a significant jump.” Gareth Evans, 54, in Cornwall, has seen the cost of his weekly shop jump in the last year. “I’m not buying anything outrageous, just cheap stuff like pizza and chips,” he says, yet his weekly spend has gone from about £15-£20 to up to £25. “I struggle to digest bread so I have to get the good stuff – that’s gone up from £0.99 to £1.35 since Christmas 2020. I presume the rise is due to import duty after Brexit.” Evans, who shops in a number of supermarkets including Asda and Co-op, says he’s also noticed that supermarkets’ ranges have shrunk. “The variety has disappeared – you walk down Asda and think they’ve just got rows and rows of green beans and no peas. When they’re short of something the price tends to go up even higher – so I’m learning to like green beans.” Evans, who receives employment support allowance, says the changing prices make it difficult to plan or save. “The smaller your income, the greater those percentage changes are,” he says, giving the example of tinned tomatoes rising from 22p to 30p. “You can go in next week and it’ll be a different price. It’s the yo-yoing of it all – it used to be that you could plan the week; I used to be able to go into the shop and know how much it would cost. I can’t plan anything, which means I can’t save up.” Ian Huckle, a 56-year-old cabinetmaker and carpenter in London, has noticed a significant increase in the price of materials. He recently found invoices for sheets of MDF from early 2019, which had been £28 a sheet at the time. They’re now £55. “The main reason is the shipping crisis – for things that shipped from China and Taiwan, the prices are through the roof,” he says. “All costs of building materials are up faster than inflation, and then there’s the slower incremental rise of things like insurance costs.” He worries that rising costs are putting off clients. “It’s getting to the point where I’m losing jobs because clients don’t want to spend that much,” he says, giving the example of some cabinets and bookcases that worked out at £2,300 when two years ago, they would have cost about £1,800. “I’ve priced my labour at the same rate as then, which means I’m effectively earning less after inflation. I’m generally busy with a good client base but I can feel I’m getting towards the limit of what people are willing to pay.”",News/Business,‘I’m not getting through the month’: five Britons on the cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/cost-of-living-crisis-expenses
1/19/2022,"Like many young Zimbabweans before and since, Tinashe Nyamudoka left the economic chaos of his country to find work and a better life for himself in neighbouring South Africa. When he left in 2008, Nyamudoka had never tasted wine. Now, he ranks among southern Africa’s top sommeliers and has his own wine label with international sales.  “We have a lot going against us as Zimbabweans, and you might think there is nothing good coming out of the country,” says the 36-year-old. “So, for me to be recognised as the [top] sommeliers in the world, being African and Zimbabwean, instils a sense of hope and pride.” Nyamudoka began his career as a waiter in a Cape Town restaurant, where he learned about the different varieties and tastes of the wines his customers drank. He moved on to become a hotel wine waiter, working alongside some of the city’s leading sommeliers. After studying his trade, he won the best wine steward award in a competition for luxury hotels in the Western Cape in 2013. His talents received international attention when, in 2017, he and three other Zimbabwean sommeliers were selected to take part in the World Blind Tasting Championship in France. The team was the first from Zimbabwe to take part in the contest, in which competitors have to use just their palate to identify the variety of grape, country of origin, appellation, vintage and producer of the wines. The Zimbabweans did not win – coming 23rd out of 24 teams – but their story became the subject of a documentary released last year, Blind Ambition, which Nyamudoka says brought him “a sense of pride”. The team returned to the competition the next year and this time came 14th – beating the UK and the US teams. His wine label, Kumusha – “home” or “roots” in Zimbabwe’s Shona language – has benefited from his celebrity, producing 200,000 bottles a year, up from 1,200 when it was launched four years ago. “People started embracing it,” he says. “I conceptualised it [the label] around 2014,” he adds. “Xenophobia was hitting home [in South Africa] and we were all missing kumusha.” The eight Kumusha wines – three reds, four whites and a rosé – are all produced in South Africa. They are sold in the US, the Netherlands, Kenya and Zimbabwe – “my exciting market”, he says. This month, he is starting to export his wines to the UK. “I started this brand from scratch with no aid or financial handouts. It has been pure grit, passion and dedication,” he says. “I want people to understand that you can make it without prejudice.” But Nyamudoka says he has encountered racism on his way to the top of a white-dominated industry. “There are instances where you get to a tasting, and it is all white [people], you kind of feel out of place. At work, you cannot get the position you want because you are black. It comes in different forms. It is not obvious, it is much more subtle,” he says. “When I was in my last days on the floor [in a restaurant], people would recognise your talent, but they would not give you your flowers [recognition] because you are not like them. It is like you must work twice as hard to prove yourself. It is always going to be there, I suppose.” Nyamudoka, who sits on the board of the recently established Sommeliers Association of Zimbabwe, hopes that his achievements will encourage other Zimbabweans to enter the wine industry. “There’s been an emergence of black sommeliers in the world as the industry becomes more diverse. We see the hospitality offering in Zimbabwe improving and there will be a need for sommeliers.” A fellow sommelier, Takura Makadzange, agrees. Also from Harare, Makdazange, 38, trained in Australia, working his way up from hotel porter to restaurant owner. Now, he is back in Zimbabwe. “I came back home because there are plenty of opportunities. There is plenty of space in hospitality. Recently there has been more of an explosion in the food and drink sector in Zimbabwe, especially speciality wines that are being made now. “The industry has grown, the fish industry has grown and we can have access to wildlife and game meat. Promoting the local food and beverage industry is a no-brainer. We have something that no one else does. National pride is important but also we have beautiful products,” he says. Makadzange qualified for last month’s Ubuntu Sommelier Trophy in South Africa, but had to withdraw when he caught Covid-19. “There are instances where a less-qualified white person is trusted with looking after the wine list over any person of colour, but you have to keep moving,” he says. “It is very unusual for a Zimbabwean to do well in this field. We want to continue that trajectory. “I think it’s time we have more women sommeliers from Zimbabwe so, hopefully, I will train someone to get to the standard of competing.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Zimbabweans put their country on the map in the world of wine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/19/hope-and-pride-zimbabweans-put-country-on-the-map-in-world-of-wine
1/19/2022,"A high-profile advocate of the woman who accused Christian Porter of raping her 30 years ago has been awarded more than $400,000 in costs after the federal court forced the former attorney general’s barrister to stand down during an ABC defamation case. Jo Dyer is a former chief executive of the Sydney writers’ festival who became one of the most prominent advocates of Porter’s deceased accuser after the former attorney general outed himself as the unnamed minister in an ABC story revealing a dossier detailing the rape claim had been circulated to politicians.  The dossier detailed allegations by the woman that Porter had raped her in January 1988 when she was 16 and he was 17. Porter has strenuously and repeatedly denied the allegations. When Porter sued the ABC for defamation over the story, Dyer began her own legal action, seeking to block barrister Sue Chrysanthou SC from acting for the former attorney. Dyer argued successfully that Chrysanthou had a potential conflict arising out of a meeting about a separate matter between the two women in November 2020, with a federal court judge ruling in May 2021 the lawyer had received confidential information which was relevant to the case and could present a “danger of misuse”. Four days later Porter dropped his case against the ABC, despite failing to secure an apology or retraction from the public broadcaster. Instead, the ABC agreed to pay mediation costs and publish an editor’s note stating that it “regretted” that some readers had “misinterpreted” the article “as an accusation of guilt against” Porter. The separate case between Dyer and Chrysanthou has continued to make its way through the courts. Following the decision that Chrysanthou should stand aside, lawyers for her and Porter sought to have the costs claim reduced, as well as access to timesheets and invoices to challenge the claim. But in a brief hearing on Wednesday, national judicial registrar Tim Luxton ordered Dyer was entitled to costs of $430,200 as part of a lump-sum payment. The costs order applies to both Chrysanthou and Porter. The ruling is complicated by the fact that lawyers for Porter last year announced the former attorney general would appeal the decision to bar Chrysanthou – despite his having ended the defamation case against the ABC. In a case management hearing in October, justice John Middleton asked Porter’s barrister, Callan O’Neill, if the appeal was related to costs, to which the lawyer replied: “On one view, costs, but also a matter of principle.” In November, a judge dismissed an attempt by Porter to access notes he claimed would assist the appeal, and made another costs order related to the exercise. The appeal is likely to be heard in February. Dyer has since launched a political career of her own. In December, she announced her intention to run for the marginal South Australian seat of Boothby as an independent, held by the retiring Liberal MP Nicolle Flint on a margin of 1.4%. In a video announcing her campaign, Dyer said she had “been involved in a campaign for women’s justice” and that she had “experienced first hand the way this government has treated that broad sweeping campaign as just another political problem preferably to be ignored, and if not ignored, managed”.",News/Australia news,"Christian Porter and barrister Sue Crysanthou ordered to pay Jo Dyer $430,000 in legal costs",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/19/christian-porter-and-barrister-sue-crysanthou-ordered-to-pay-jo-dyer-430000-in-legal-costs
1/19/2022,"Two years ago, hardly anyone outside the world of competitive cheerleading would have been familiar with Navarro College, based in the small Texan town of Corsicana, its junior college cheer squad, or its head coach, Monica Aldama. But the global success of Cheer, Netflix’s Emmy-winning docuseries following Aldama and her team’s journey to the national championships in Daytona, changed all of that. Audiences were immediately captivated by the technical skill, athleticism and personal dramas of competitive cheerleading. Cast members became stars, garnering huge social media followings and appearing on the likes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show and Oprah’s live tour. Aldama’s signature blond highlights and no-nonsense “mat talk” were satirised on SNL. Reese Witherspoon even said she inspired her to the point of tears.  “None of us expected it to be as big as it was,” says Aldama, following the release of season two, which shot straight to the top of Netflix charts last week. “We thought maybe the cheer community would watch it. We went from zero to 100 really fast.” But the attention hasn’t all been positive. Aldama has been portrayed as a complicated figure: someone to whom the kids can turn for support – which many of them haven’t received elsewhere due to the circumstances of their upbringing – but also someone who rules the squad with an iron fist, encouraging cheerleaders to push through pain, at times to the point of collapse. Concerns were raised about the number of cheerleading-related injuries, including concussions and bruised ribs. Aldama was too tough, critics said, too heartless. “I don’t like to disappoint, I’m a pleaser. So to see people’s perception of me was shocking,” she says. “I’ve worked so hard to do everything right, and I have a huge heart for these kids.” She stresses that Cheer is an edited show, focusing overwhelmingly on every fall and tumble. “We are very well trained. We do a lot of progressions to build up to anything difficult. As with any sport, you obviously have risks and injuries but, for the most part, it’s normal wear and tear.” Though her skin has got thicker, she says, the daily comments “definitely hurt”. “I don’t know if it’s because I’m a female, but I definitely don’t think anyone would criticise a football coach for being tough and having high expectations.” The other safety concern regards actions off the mat. Cheer made headlines last year after one of its biggest stars and fan favourite Jerry Harris was arrested and charged with production of child pornography. Harris denies seven charges regarding five minor boys, including four counts of sexual exploitation of children, one count of receiving and attempting to receive child pornography, one count of travelling with the attempt to engage in sexual conduct with a minor and one count of enticement. Part of this season is devoted to Harris’s alleged victims’ stories and the broader issue of child safety in cheerleading. When the news broke, we are told, Aldama was taking part in Dancing With the Stars, and found out just before her first onscreen dance. “It was shocking and devastating for all of us,” she says now. “Anybody with a heart can imagine the pain we would be going through, for the victims and for someone we loved. It still affects us daily.” That openness, regarding her conflicted feelings towards Harris, led to accusations on social media that she was refusing to disown a child predator, with the appearance of mocked-up images of her and others behind bars. Others said she was absent when her team needed her most. “When you’re in a really low place already, it’s difficult when you keep getting hit. People will see one small piece of an interview I did a long time ago, at the lowest point of my career, and judge me. They assume I didn’t speak up on anything else and that’s just not true. I have to keep in my head that people don’t know me. I know where my heart is.” She can still barely talk about it without coming to tears. The episode, including claims, by the mother of two of the alleged victims, that the cheerleading industry turned a blind eye to wrongdoing, makes for difficult viewing. But for Aldama, shining a light on what happened is key to progress. “I know that episode was hard to watch, but it was important for people to feel like they can come forward. The more education we can have, the better the whole system will be.” This includes classes, “not only for the coaches, but also for the children on what’s appropriate”. In conversation, Aldama has a warmth that belies the caricatures. Nowhere is this more evident than in her relationship with La’Darius Marshall, one of the lead cast members, who, in a plot twist this season, leaves the squad, claiming he didn’t receive the support he needed. Aldama, who has said previously that she went “above and beyond” for him, speaks of the pain the rupture brought her. The pair’s tearful reconciliation in the final episode is one of the most emotional moments of the series. “I wear so many different hats, from adviser to counsellor to mother,” she says. “I’m there for them to come and cry to if they have relationship problems, or their parents are going through a divorce. It’s a huge responsibility, because sometimes you’re the only person that they have.” So what of Aldama’s “cheerleading dynasty” – the “machine” that her rivals so often refer to? She has led her squad to 14 NCA All-Star National Championships, and five grand national titles. Much of it, she says, stems from her background in business. After cheering at Tyler Junior College, Aldama transferred to the University of Texas, where she received a finance degree and, later, an MBA (master of business administration). She joined Navarro after a friend – then assistant baseball coach at the college – told her to apply. “I had no intention of ever being a cheerleading coach. I was just out of college and not quite sure what I wanted to do, so I took the job temporarily. Here I am, 27 years later.” The so-called Navarro machine, she explains, was something she built from the ground up. “I looked at it like a business plan. What’s my end goal? To win a national championship. How do I get there? I get the highest score. How do I do that? I analyse the score sheet.” After Cheer came out, she says she had many people asking her for advice in all areas of life, from parenting to relationships to work. Her new book, Full Out, which was published this month, addresses all of this. “When you’re coaching, you have so many stories and challenges every single year. The book talks about some of the core principles that I try to instil in my own athletes to set them up for success.” To be a champion in life, she says, one needs to be resilient, able to communicate, lead by example and hold yourself accountable for your own actions. “You keep putting one foot in front of the other no matter what you’re going through.” Thanks to her, Corsicana, which is about 50 miles south of Dallas and boasts a population of about 25,000 people, is now a point of reference worldwide. Navarro Cheer have become hometown heroes. “I think we add a fun element to the community. We definitely bring some diversity and the community welcomes that with open arms.” Although she is often asked if she will move on to coaching other teams, Aldama is adamant that her coaching career begins and ends at Navarro, “whenever that time comes”. She is not ready to say goodbye to the kids just yet, but when she does she plans to explore opportunities in the world of business and finance. Her life, she says, has “definitely changed” since she agreed to let Netflix into it in 2017 – but she remains the same person, trying to do and be her best. “I’m still living in a small town, I do my day-to-day job. It feels very normal to me.”  Cheer season two is on Netflix now. Full Out is available now.

1/19/2022,"Britain’s cost of living crisis worsened in December after inflation jumped to 5.4% – its highest level in almost 30 years – driven by the higher cost of clothes, food and footwear. Heaping further pressure on Bank of England policymakers to push up interest rates when they meet next month, the price of furniture and eating out also increased as shortages of staff and hold-ups at UK ports forced up the cost of imports.  The Bank of England expects the consumer prices index (CPI) to rise to 6% by April while some analysts have forecast it could hit 7% unless the government decides to pump billions of pounds into the energy sector to cap spiralling heating costs. Ofgem, the energy regulator, must announce a rise in the price cap on gas bills in the next fortnight and it is understood ministers are scrambling to put together a package of measures to prevent an estimated £500 per household annual increase. Oil prices continued to make a large contribution to the increasing cost of living, a trend that has continued this year after a surge in Brent crude to more than $80 a barrel. Figures for wages in November showed pay packets increased by 4.2%, including bonuses, on the previous year but fell behind the rising cost of living by 0.9%. Unless wages leap in December, the increase in prices will leave the average worker even worse off. The only positive sign for chancellor Rishi Sunak, who has come under intense pressure to provide funds for low income families to cope with rising costs, was that the Office for National Statistics reported a downward trend in the monthly rise in CPI. Inflation increased by 0.5% in December, down from 0.7% in November and 1.1% in October. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: “What is of particular concern is that the change from November has come mainly from an increase in the price of food. “Not only does this provide additional evidence that inflation is becoming endemic rather than transitory, it also bodes ill for households facing multiple rises in the cost of living this spring. “We therefore expect interest rates to rise again when the Bank of England monetary policy committee next meets in early February.”",News/Business,UK inflation hits near-three-decade high rising to 5.4%,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/uk-inflation-hits-near-three-decade-high-rising-to-54
1/19/2022,"Expanding national parks and protected areas will not be enough to halt the destruction of nature, warn leading scientists, who say urgent action on overconsumption, harmful subsidies and the climate crisis is also required to halt biodiversity loss. Governments are expected to commit to a Paris-style agreement for nature at Cop15 in Kunming, China, later this year, with targets that include protecting at least 30% of the oceans and land by 2030.  An analysis of the draft UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) agreement by more than 50 leading scientists has found that, while expanding protected areas will, if done well, help slow the destruction of the natural world, much more is needed to stop it. At Cop15 – the 15th conference of the parties to the UN convention on biological diversity – governments will negotiate new targets to protect biodiversity for this decade. The accord, “a Paris agreement for nature”, aims to slow rampant biodiversity loss around the world and is part of the UN’s overarching plan that humanity should be living in harmony with nature by 2050. The summit was originally due to take place in October 2020 but after several delays it is hoped that a face-to-face meeting will happen in 2022. Why is it a big deal?Time is running out to take action. An international group of scientists, including Prof Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb, warned in January 2021 that the planet is facing a “ghastly future of mass extinction, declining health and climate-disruption upheavals” that threaten human survival. The world has failed to meet a single target agreed a decade ago to stem the destruction of wildlife and life-sustaining ecosystems. Are only governments worried?No. At the 2021 World Economic Forum, business leaders said biodiversity loss was the third biggest existential, or long-term threat, to the world and was among the top five risks in terms of impact, alongside infectious diseases, climate action failure, weapons of mass destruction and natural resource crises. What might the Kunming agreement look like?In January 2021, the UN convention on biological diversity published a 21-point draft of the agreement. It commits signatories to protect at least 30% of the planet, control invasive species and reduce pollution from plastic waste and excess nutrients by 50%. Governments are yet to negotiate properly on the draft targets.  Prof Paul Leadley, an ecologist at Paris-Saclay University and co-author of the report, said: “The target of protecting 30% of all land and seas is important and attracting a lot of attention. And expanding protected areas is a good start if done well, but far short of what is needed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss – called ‘bending the curve’ for biodiversity. “There is very good evidence that we will fail again to meet ambitious international biodiversity objectives if there’s too much focus on protected areas at the expense of other urgent actions addressing the threats to biodiversity.” A “massive” reduction in harmful agricultural and fishing subsidies, holding global heating to 1.5C and tackling human overconsumption, including of meat, is necessary, the scientists said, as part of coordinated action across a diverse, interconnected set of “transformative” changes. The 21 draft targets to be negotiated at Kunming include proposals to eliminate plastic pollution, reduce pesticide use by two-thirds and half the rate of invasive species introduction. The agreement aims to stop what some scientists have called the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth, driven by human behaviour, which threatens ecosystems vital to human civilisation. The analysis of the proposed agreement, conducted by the scientific bodies BioDiscovery and the Group on Earth Observations Biodiversity Observation Network (Geo Bon), has been sent to governments, who will give their feedback later this month. The assessment looked at the impact of three scenarios on halting and reversing biodiversity loss: business as usual, improved quality and quantity of conservation, and transformative change of society. It found that only the last scenario will have the desired effect, assuming global heating is limited to 1.5C. “What we’re doing is trying to take the best science and explain why the global biodiversity framework looks like it does. A lot of countries are saying it’s so complicated. We’re trying to explain why you need all the pieces and how each piece fits together,” Leadley said. The analysis comes after confusion over the breath and complexity of the draft agreement, which ranges from pollution to the inclusion of indigenous communities. In March, governments are scheduled to hold in-person negotiations for the first time since February 2020, after several delays to the process. Governments have failed to meet a single target on halting the destruction of nature in the past decade. María Cecilia Londoño Murcia, a researcher at the Humboldt Institute in Colombia and co-author of the analysis, said: “The sooner we act, the better. Time lags between action and positive outcomes for biodiversity can take decades, so we must act immediately and sustain our efforts if we are to reach the global goals by 2050.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,"Expanding national parks not enough to protect nature, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/19/expanding-national-parks-not-enough-to-protect-nature-say-scientists-aoe
1/19/2022,"We’ve all seen that sign in hotels where we are encouraged to reuse our towels for the sake of the planet. Often it’s just lip service. But what if that idea is taken a level upwards – to make your whole hotel sustainable? That’s the premise at room2 in Chiswick, west London, said to be the world’s first net zero “hometel”. It’s forecast to be 89% more energy efficient than a typical UK hotel and has a host of sustainable measures, from solar panels to recycled furniture, zero food waste and a wildflower roof.  It’s the brainchild of owner Robert Godwin, who is passionate about driving a cultural shift in an industry where sustainability is often an afterthought. I didn’t think an overnight hotel stay could make me think about climate change, but here it does, and not in a preachy way. The staff are all on board and proud of their sustainable goals – and all the small details add up. As we arrive, someone is picking up an order from Too Good To Go, an app that connects people to restaurants and shops that have a food surplus, and the lobby is packed with plants and upcycled furniture. Another welcome innovation is flexibility: check-in is from 2pm, as is check-out, so you get a full 24 hours to make the most of your stay. Each room has a kitchenette – hence the hometel moniker – so it’s great for those who want to keep costs down by self-catering. Coffee and delicious food are available in the Boca restaurant on the ground floor – more on that later. Our studio is flooded with light from big Crittall windows and has everything you could expect from a boutique stay: big, comfy bed with crisp linen, Roberts radio, calming colour scheme and the kitchen is fully-equipped. I never thought I would get so excited about rubbish, but the three-in-one bin in the room – for food waste, mixed recycling and general waste – really makes us mindful of what we are using. Godwin tells us he looked at 200 bins from around the world, couldn’t find one that fitted his ethos, and came up with this design. “We needed the right ones to encourage our guests to recycle in the right way,” says Godwin. “All of the waste is compartmentalised and sent to different plants for mixed recycling or renewable energy. And all food waste goes to a new life.” There are natural textures everywhere: wood flooring, a blue-and-white striped fabric headboard, rattan chairs and a cork bench. A wooden Do Not Disturb sign, Post-it notes made of recycled paper, and pens and pencils which guests are asked to leave behind after use for future guests are nice touches. Features such as the bespoke marble-print wallpaper in the bathroom and the Dali-esque handcrafted mirrors were inspired by Chiswick’s Arts and Crafts heritage. And any carbon emissions from unavoidable items such as the biggish television are offset by a tree-planting scheme with its reforesting partner in Nicaragua. The energy-efficient shower – said to use 40% less water – is huge and powerful enough for any long-stayer. Bath towels are generously sized, and heavenly smelling body wash and shampoo come in dispensers from vegan brand Doers of London. Carpets on the corridors are made from recycled fishing nets, and in the basement there’s a 24-hour laundry and a gym with Peloton bikes, weights and yoga mats. The real behind-the-scenes savings are in energy use, according to Godwin. “We are forecast to be 89% more energy efficient than a typical UK hotel and that’s largely through minimising heat and energy loss. We are built to new regulations and, collectively, it’s a massive improvement.” Those improvements include a ground source heat pump, solar panels, motion sensors in the rooms, a green roof with 75,000 bees and wildflowers for biodiversity and insulation, and a blue roof to capture rainwater and minimise local flooding. Any additional power will be bought from solar, wind and hydro sources. Two lab rooms monitor the efficiency of the building and how guests use power and energy in their rooms. So why is the hotel industry lagging behind on sustainability? “I think it’s a lack of will, and that comes from a lack of knowledge,” says Godwin, whose epiphany came after a trip to South Africa in 2019 where he saw first-hand the effects of climate change in droughts and collapsing food chains. He is now seen as a trailblazer, with big hotel chains including Hilton coming to him for advice. In the Boca restaurant kitchen, there are no big fryers or extractor fans, and the menu, created by head chef Elisabetta Boi, has been adapted to be low energy. Boi tells us she is sourcing locally where she can, and bringing a taste of her Italian heritage. Zero waste is the aim here, too: potato peelings are made into vodka and any other waste is recycled or available on the Too Good To Go app. We try some sample dishes of what is to come when Boca fully opens on 1 February, and they all pack a punch in flavour. There is delicious homemade focaccia with wholemeal flour, risotto with black truffle and parmesan, and a white radicchio salad with figs and house-made fresh ricotta. Puddings are a tiramisu with mascarpone and a mouthwatering panettone filled with ice-cream. Starters are from £8 and mains from £10.50, pretty much the going rate in Chiswick. Next morning we grab a coffee and head off to Chiswick High Road, just paces away. There is no need for a car park at room2, as public transport is so good. Turnham Green station is three minutes’ walk away, from where it’s a 20-minute tube journey into central London. There are frequent buses to Kew Gardens or Richmond Park, or you can wander down to the Thames to admire the houses of leading Arts and Crafts figures Emery Walker and William Morris. Morris urged people to have nothing in their house that wasn’t beautiful or useful. Room2 has beauty and utility in abundance, and shows that being net zero doesn’t have to mean compromising on comfort or style.Doubles from £116 room only, room2.com/chiswick Iceland On a farm in southern Iceland, Hotel Fljótshlíð has been certified by Svanurinn, a Nordic eco labelling scheme, which means it is one of the most environment-friendly hotels in the area. Its 14 rooms have heated floors and private bathrooms, all powered by renewable energy. Nationwide, Iceland uses 70% hydropower and 30% geothermal. Guests can pay to plant trees to offset their carbon footprint, and the hotel is aiming for zero food waste. Local jams, meat, eggs and vegetables can be bought on site or in the restaurant. There are views of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano, and guests can go horse riding or tour the working farm.Doubles from £106 B&B, smaratun.is Greece In Zagori, north-western Greece, Aristi Mountain Resort & Villas was built with traditional methods and using only locally available materials. Water consumption is minimised with pressure regulators and wastewater is recycled through a hi-tech cleaning system. It’s a member of Stay Beyond Green, a hotel network that is vetted according to UN sustainable development goals. The hotel’s award-winning Salvia restaurant uses fruit and vegetables from its own gardens and greenhouse, rears its own chickens and has local trout on the menu. The 24 rooms, suites and villas are spread out so they blend into the mountains, and activities include hiking, rafting, horse riding and birdwatching.Doubles from €178 B&B, aristi.eu Ireland Opened last September, the Wren in Dublin uses 100% renewable energy and recyclable and biodegradable materials. Aiming to be Ireland’s most sustainable hotel, it makes a conscious effort to limit single-use plastics in its 137 rooms and puts a big emphasis on local. Wonky veg is used in the kitchen and waste is reduced by using Too Good To Go. The ALT bar makes the most of local distilleries and breweries, with Irish whiskey, Dingle gin and micro ales on tap. It’s a four-minute walk to Trinity College and Grafton Street and a 19-minute walk to Connolly, the country’s busiest train station.Rooms from €129 room only, wrenhotel.ie Portugal In the Alqueva dark sky reserve, Montimerso Skyscape Country House has 15 rooms, all with contemporary Portuguese furnishings, and a terrace or balcony. Rainwater is used for irrigation and, because of its dark sky location, light pollution has been reduced. The staff are mostly from the local Alentejo region and local food suppliers are used wherever possible. The big draw here is the sky – the reserve was the world’s first Unesco-certified starlight tourism destination.

1/19/2022,"Afew times a day, off the Faroe Islands’ coast, the crew of the Jákup Sverri marine survey ship test the water, measuring its salinity, temperature and oxygen at different sea depths. But they also look for something else. Durita Sørensen, a laboratory technician, holds up the contents of a special net to demonstrate. If the water is greenish, it contains a lot of phytoplankton, the plants at the base of the oceanic food chain. But if it is red or brown, as in Sørensen’s net, the haul is one rung higher up the ladder: zooplankton. “This is calanus, or Calanus finmarchicus,” she says, indicating the tiny red creatures. “This is what they are interested in making fish oil [from] as a food supplement for humans.”  Zooplankton is a crucial part of the Atlantic Ocean ecosystem. And calanus – known as Reyðæti in Faroese or “red plankton” – is one of the most important and populous varieties. In 2020, the Faroese fisheries ministry gave five companies the right to fish for up to 25,000 tonnes of it each. There is no factory yet on the Faroe Islands for processing the tiny red creatures into fish oil, but entrepreneurs are hoping it will soon become big business, supplying not only the apparently insatiable demand for omega-3 health supplements across the western world, but potentially for use in the even vaster fish-farming industry. Zooplankton fishing is already happening in Norway, where a company called Zooca, which has been harvesting red plankton for some years, received a commercial quota in 2020. The Norwegian Institute of Marine Research says the harvest is well within sustainable limits. But many in the fishing industry are unhappy about the idea of sucking up zooplankton. Red plankton is the main food of many hugely valuable fish stocks – including mackerel and herring – and is vital for the juvenile growth of a species that is a mainstay of the Norwegian and Faroese industrial fleets: cod. Some scientists, meanwhile, warn that we have no idea what removing zooplankton from the oceanic food chain will do. “It’s a drop in the bucket right now,” says Peter Wiebe, scientist emeritus at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, of the current zooplankton harvest. “But what they have in mind is not a drop in the bucket.” Zooplankton are tiny animals. They are copepods, or small crustaceans, each about the size of a rice grain. Zooplankton spend their summers in the sunny upper layers of the ocean, where they feed on phytoplankton, a plant that depends on photosynthesis. During the winter, however, the zooplankton go into hibernation. They slowly sink down into the deeper layers of the ocean and, lacking the capability to swim, they then float with the current. Around the Faroe Islands, that means travelling south-east before being pushed up through the narrow Faroe Bank channel and into deeper, colder oceans, where it is estimated that 90% of them die. This gave Eilif Gaard an idea. In his office, the head of the Faroese Marine Institute (Famri) holds up a box full of dark red capsules: omega-3 oil, made from red plankton. Zooca, the producer, says that its zooplankton oil is superior to conventional omega-3 oil, claiming in a 2019 paper that the zooplankton can counteract “insulin resistance and other obesity-induced metabolic disorders and exhibit a potent anti-inflammatory effect.” Zooca says the demand for omega-3 has caused many species to become overfished, and claims zooplankton is a sustainable alternative. Gaard wants a cut of this growing market for the Faroes. A marine biologist by training, as director of Famri he is more used to telling the fishing crews to catch less. But he proposed using the Faroe Bank channel to catch plankton that might otherwise die upon entering deeper open sea. “We have this channel where the current flows through, which gives us a special opportunity,” he says. “By doing our fishing in the channel and only during winter, we aren’t affecting ecosystems.” He admits not enough is known about the species after it leaves the continental shelf around the islands. Nevertheless, he recommended setting the zooplankton fishing quota at 125,000 tonnes, which he says is about 1.2% of the total mass of calanus that flows through the area. One of the fishers who received a licence is Jógvan í Skorini. The former mayor of Eiði, a village of about 700 people, Skorini now works as a schoolteacher but always dreamed of fishing. In 2017, he got a call from his friend Heini Niclasen, who had just learned about the fledgling zooplankton industry. Excited, the two friends flew to Norway, where they visited Calanus, the company that would later become Zooca, and left clutching a vital piece of paper. “We made a contract for exporting the potential harvest to them, and we get knowhow from them,” Skorini says. Back in the Faroes, Skorini partnered with his uncle, one of the biggest shipowners in the islands, who also applied for a quota and rented a boat to Skorini to haul in their collective 50,000-tonne catch. With a price per kilo of about $1.50 (£1.10), zooplankton could become a $100m business for the Faroe Islands and its 50,000 inhabitants. Harvesting plankton in the Faroes is easier said than done, however. The Faroe Bank channel is an undersea gorge about 50 miles (75km) south-west of the islands where cold water rushes through at an immense pressure of 2.2m cubic metres a second – twice the force of all the rivers in the world combined. Skorini’s first trawl net was torn to pieces in the current. They are working to develop a new, specially adapted system that covers the fine mesh net under a wider outer net designed to withstand the water’s destructive power. Skorini and his partners are learning from Zooca, which was started in 2002 by Kurt Tande, then a professor at the University of Tromsø in Norway. What began as a research company looking into the possible benefits of zooplankton omega-3 has since become a thriving business, employing about 100 people, selling its fish oil in Europe and North America, with a revenue of $9.2m last year. In August, the then Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, visited Zooca’s newly built factory in Sortland. But other sectors of Norway’s fishing industry are concerned. Tom Vegar Kiil, head of Norges Kystfiskarlag, the association for Norwegian coastal fisheries, is one of the highest-profile opponents of zooplankton trawling. The Norwegian quota is 254,000 tonnes but, unlike in the Faroes, fishing for it is permitted all year – and in the warmer, upper layers of the sea, where Kiil is concerned that Zooca is catching larvae and juvenile fish in its nets. “We haven’t been good enough at taking care of our stocks,” Kiil says, referring to Norway’s loss last year of its Marine Stewardship Council’s sustainability label on cod fished near the coast. The idea of fishing one of juvenile cod’s most important foods strikes him as shortsighted. Kiil is also worried that the fish-farming industry will get involved. He fears that once they begin to use zooplankton for aquaculture they will start to demand even higher quotas – particularly for shrimp and salmon farming. Wiebe, an expert on the ecology of zooplankton, says there is a growing appetite for these kinds of fisheries in the so-called mesopelagic zone – the layer in the sea 200 to 1,000 metres below the surface. “There’s a lot of interest in fishing that part of the ocean, to capture stuff for aquaculture, to use it for feed for agriculture. That has a lot of ramifications,” he says. Others fishery associations have criticised the zooplankton trawlers for operating in spawning grounds during summer. And last year, Geir Jørgensen, a municipal politician in Nordland, led one of Norway’s regional councils to call on the national government to halt the trawling for plankton off the coast. The marine biologists at Norway’s Marine Research Institute disagree with those who want the plankton fisheries curbed. Cecilie Thorsen Broms, the institute’s head of research, says the current fisheries take only a fraction of the allocated quota of 254,000 tonnes. She says Zooca, which is still the only company fishing for red plankton, must test each haul for bycatch and that the numbers are far from frightening. “Our estimate has shown that the amount of bycatch is very small, so it will not affect the fish population,” she says. But Wiebe is not convinced. Part of a working group at the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea that looks at the ecology of zooplankton, he thinks that what starts small now will only grow. “They have in mind getting the technology to the place where they can actually go out and really exploit it,” he says of the budding zooplankton industry. “And I think, without the kind of studies that are needed to understand the dynamics of the populations there, we do that foolhardily.” Zooplankton is a key part of the food chain, he points out, for fish as well as seabirds. “A lot of the big predators in the ocean swim down into the mesopelagic daily to feed. And so if you start harvesting that mesopelagic regime, you may well be doing damage to a different kind of commercial fishery.” The chief executive of Zooca, Siv-Katrin Ramskjell, is not backing down. “We harvest way less than 0.01% of the quota that the Marine Research Institute thinks is sustainable,” she says. Ramskjell argues that although bycatch was an early challenge, they have developed new technologies to minimise it and, far from reducing their catch of zooplankton, they plan to rapidly expand. “Today we only fish around 1,000 tonnes yearly, but the goal is to fish 10 times more – or around 10,000 tonnes in five years,” she says. It is the prospect of that exponential growth that makes Javier Lopez, campaign director at the conservation group Oceana, fearful. “For us, this is an example of the greed of the human being to exploit and exploit,” he says. “It is true that maybe, to the extension that it is done right now, [zooplankton fishing] is not having an ecological effect – [but] we should not create any dependence on these kinds of resources.”",News/Environment,Cutting the food chain?
