2/16/2022,"Since 2020, chip stocks are up 82%, easily beating the 54% gain for the Nasdaq Composite, Barron's reports. Big names like Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA) have gotten much of the attention, but a little-known chip maker has beat them all: Synaptics Inc (NASDAQ: SYNA). Once a low-key provider of chips used for PC touchpads, mobile phone screens, and fingerprint scanners, Synaptics has turned itself into a play on the Internet of Things, which aims to bridge the physical and digital worlds, the author notes. In recent months, though, Synaptics has been caught up in the broader tech selloff, with shares down 28% from their December peak. Savitz contends that the pullback is a good entry point for investors who missed the original rally. Price Action: SYNA shares closed lower by 3.05% at $212.11 on Friday.
