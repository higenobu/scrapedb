4/25/2022,"It had all the hallmarks of a title celebration. The freshly-minted commemorative T-shirts, the streams of flying beer, the full stadium (for the first time in an Allianz Arena edition of this fixture for two-and-a-half years), beating opponents of name to finish the job and the rest. This was historic, as Bayern Munich clinched a 10th successive Bundesliga title. Yet it felt strangely empty, a sensation that couldn’t wholly be put down either to the recent dumping out of the Champions League or just plain old overfamiliarity. Not even conquering Borussia Dortmund, the rivals who arguably started it all, drawing Bayern’s best ever years from them with their nerve in capturing straight titles under Jürgen Klopp, could help to shake the circle of doubts that dog the Rekordmeister right now. On the pitch those start with their top scorer, the man whose 33rd league goal of another extraordinary season just before half-time set Bayern on an inexorable course to fulfilling their Saturday night destiny. Yet his post-match thoughts were opaque, rather than particularly triumphant. “It’s not that easy for me, what’s going on,” Robert Lewandowski told Sky after the match, where the traditional beer showers – one of which, from Thomas Müller, drenched Bastian Schweinsteiger as he performed his pitchside duties for US television – couldn’t wash away the questions currently nagging at Bayern on all levels. “Something will happen soon,” Lewandowski added of his contract situation, with Barcelona persistently credited with an interest, whilst declining to be drawn on what that something would be. It appears the issue, perhaps more than the potential of Lewandowski having an itch to scratch in terms of one last career challenge, is Bayern’s reticence to extend his contract beyond an extra year given the expense involved. Given his career-best form in the last few years, improving as he moves further into his mid-30s, the striker has every right to feel underwhelmed by the club’s position. His directing of the questioner to “ask the club” whether they wanted to him to stay was not his first instance of doing so). With sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic categorically ruling out selling him in the summer as a guest on Sky90 on Sunday morning the possibility of Lewandowski leaving as he arrived, walking for free in 2023, cannot be ruled out. The other two 30-somethings in a similar contractual situation, Müller and Manuel Neuer, nailed their own colours to the mast with their words, with Neuer the final player on the pitch saluting the fans after the party moved to the changing room. There is little doubt over Julian Nagelsmann being the man to take them forward, despite that exit to Villarreal. “It wasn’t the easiest year,” he said with some circumspection, putting into perspective the journey so far, the standards required and the future. The coach is aware that his debut season saw him “allowed to experiment and settle in,” as Kicker editor Kalrheinz Wilder put it, and that the margins for error will only get tighter from here. He may be the second youngest coach to win the Bundesliga – after Matthias Sammer with Dortmund in 2002 – but he is no greenhorn, and fully attuned to what it means to be Bayern coach. Nagelsmann also shrewdly noted that the manner of Saturday’s coronation, beating the nearest Bayern have had to domestic rivals in the last decade, “puts the season in a better light.” On a cosmetic level there was a pleasing amount of resistance, with Dortmund starting briskly and mounting a passable attempted comeback at the start of the second half, with Emre Can cutting the deficit with a penalty while another spot kick should probably have followed when Benjamin Pavard clumsily clipped at Jude Bellingham. Referee Daniel Siebert later said that, on reflection, “a penalty would have been the correct decision”. 3️⃣ #DerKlassiker goals...3️⃣ #Bundesliga points...🔟 consecutive titles for @FCBayernEN!🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆 pic.twitter.com/JNLyiSmYzr Yet Bayern’s three gift-wrapped goals in this game – Gnabry’s scintillating finish for the opener notwithstanding – underlined that Niklas Süle and Freiburg’s Nico Schlotterbeck can’t arrive soon enough for Dortmund. They should not be the end of the rebuild. Bellingham is an exhilarating footballer, and is likely to be joined in midfield by another English teenager, Jamie Bynoe-Gittens, who made his second first-team appearance as a substitute and appears to be a big part of Marco Rose’s plans. But their best midfielder being an 18-year-old, however prodigiously talented he might be, is an issue. It is not only Bayern stepping into a realm of uncertainty and if they have questions to answer in the coming months, there are at least as many to be directed at BVB. Bayern’s title-winning winning margins in the past decade – with this season yet to finish and the champions currently 12 points clear, only one of their run of titles was won by a single-figure points gap - are not solely down to the Munich giants’ lofty standards in that time. After another second-placed season that has severely disappointed, Rose and Dortmund in particular will spend the summer under scrutiny as they attempt to find a way to challenge credibly post-Erling Haaland. While Bayern’s uncertainty certainly exists, the best of the rest must move swiftly to dispel theirs to even threaten to break the hegemony. Hertha Berlin 2-0 Stuttgart, Bochum 0-2 Augsburg, Bayern 3-1 Dortmund, Cologne 3-1 Arminia Bielefeld, Eintracht Frankfurt 2-2 Hoffenheim, Freiburg 3-3 Borussia M'gladbach, Greuther Fürth 1-4 Leverkusen, Leipzig 1-2 Union Berlin, Wolfsburg 5-0 Mainz The most thrilling game of the weekend was Freiburg’s game against Borussia Mönchengladbach, with Christian Streich’s side in with a chance of a snaring an improbable top-four finish. At the end of the week in which they reached the DfB Pokal for the first time, they trailed 2-0 early on but turned it around to lead via Philipp Leinhart’s towering header, only for Lars Stindl to snatch a 93rd-minute equaliser for Gladbach. Streich admitted his players were “totally devastated” but made his pride in them clear. “If I was a fan and this team stayed together,” he said, “I’d buy a season ticket for the next two years.” Had Stindl not scored Freiburg would be level on points with the other Pokal finalists, fourth-placed Leipzig, who planted a rare misstepin the Domenico Tedesco era in losing at home by Union. Goals by Sven Michel and Kevin Behrens turned the game in the last five minutes, putting the Berliners, who are 6th, within four points of the Champions League places. Leverkusen’s 4-1 at Greuther Fürth put them back into third and relegated the hosts. There’s breathing space at the bottom for Hertha, with a 2-0 win over Stuttgart in Berlin – a fine volley from Davie Selke set them on the way – putting Felix Magath’s side four points clear of the playoff spot-occupying Swabians. “We started well in the first five minutes,” admitted Magath, “but I don’t know if anyone should be euphoric.” Stuttgart’s sporting director Sven Mislintat expressed his anger, calling the first 30 minutes “one of our worst games of the season.” Two of the league’s most reliable goalscorers hit the headlines too - Max Kruse’s first-half hat-trick helped Wolfsburg to a much-needed win over Mainz, while Anthony Modeste could be in hot water despite his strike to set Köln on the way to victory over Arminia Bielefeld He celebrated by throwing a bag of his own brand of coffee into the crowd and is now the subject of a DFB investigation.",Sport/Football,Ten titles in succession but Bayern are wracked by uncertainty | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/25/10-bundesliga-titles-in-a-row-but-bayern-munich-are-wracked-by-uncertainty
4/25/2022,"Good morning. Russia is failing in its war aims and “Ukraine is succeeding”, Washington’s top diplomat has announced after a visit to Kyiv during which he pledged additional military aid, including advanced weapons, and a return of US envoys. The trip by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, was the highest-level American visit to the capital since Russia invaded in late February. During talks, Blinken and Austin told Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the US would provide more than $300m (£235m) in military financing and had approved a $165m sale of ammunition, bringing total US security assistance since the invasion to about $3.7bn. More than $400m will also be split among 15 other countries in central and eastern Europe and the Balkans. Blinken also said US diplomats returning to Ukraine would probably restaff the consulate in Lviv in western Ukraine before returning to Kyiv, the capital. They previously said the diplomats would start returning this week. What else did Blinken say? He told reporters this morning: “Ukrainians are standing up. They are standing strong. And they are doing that with the support that we have coordinated from literally around the world. What has Russia said? The Kremlin has warned the US against sending more arms to Ukraine, Moscow’s ambassador to Washington told Russian state television. “We stressed the unacceptability of this situation when the United States of America pours weapons into Ukraine,” Anatoly Antonov said. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 61 of the invasion. The pro-European centrist Emmanuel Macron has vowed to unite a divided France after winning a second term as French president in a decisive victory against the far-right’s Marine Le Pen, who won more than 13m votes in a historic high for her anti-immigration party. Macron became the first French leader to win re-election for 20 years, scoring 58.54% to Le Pen’s 41.46%. Addressing a victory rally at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, where his supporters waved French and European flags, Macron pledged to respond “efficiently” to the “anger and disagreement” of voters who chose the far right. “I know that a number of French people have voted for me today, not to support my ideas but to stop the ideas of the far right,” he said. The president called on supporters to be “kind and respectful” to others because the country was riven by “so much doubt, so much division”. He added: “I’m not the candidate of one camp any more but the president of all of us.” What were the results? Macron beat Le Pen with a lower margin than the 66% he won against her in 2017. Turnout was also lower than five years ago, with abstention estimated at a record 28%. What’s next for Marine Le Pen? Far-right leader hails “victory in itself” and vows to fight on after winning more than 40% of the vote. The progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told Amazon’s first unionized workers in New York yesterday that their victory was “the first domino to fall” in what she expected to be a wave of similar votes for representation across the country. The leftwing Democrat joined Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on stage in Staten Island to celebrate the historic achievement and to call for workers in more Amazon facilities in the US to follow their example. “What happened out here … what you guys did in Staten Island was just the beginning. It was the first domino to fall,” she said, noting that workers at a second Amazon sorting facility in the New York borough were voting today. “We have another election tomorrow, and we’re going to support them in that. And the day after that, and the day after that, all the way. But what we need Amazon to do first and foremost is to recognize the union that won their election.” What have Amazon said? Amazon has so far refused to acknowledge the vote at its Staten Island fulfillment center. Immediately after the result, Amazon, owned by the world’s second richest man, Jeff Bezos, went to court to try to get the outcome overturned. Democrats need to “get up off our rear ends” and work to bring down prices and runaway inflation, or face wipeout in November’s midterm elections, the Massachusetts senator, Elizabeth Warren, has warned. She told CNN: “We’ve got less than 200 days until the election and American families are hurting.” Beijingers were flooding supermarkets to stock up on food on Monday, hoping to avoid Shanghai-style shortages in the event of a similar citywide lockdown as the capital records a growing number of Covid infections. Authorities in Beijing have ordered 3.5 million residents to report for tests. Rescuers searching for survivors since a tour boat carrying 26 people apparently sank off north-eastern Japan have found the body of an 11th victim – a child – as questions intensify about why the vessel sailed in rough weather at a known hazardous location. The bodies of 10 people were found on Sunday. Twitter began negotiations with Elon Musk on Sunday after he wooed shareholders with financing details on his $43bn acquisition offer, people familiar with the matter said. The company’s decision to engage with Musk did not mean it would accept his $54.20 a share bid, they added. Across the country, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been filed this legislative year, according to the Human Rights Campaign. Most of them target transgender children, a demographic not even old enough to vote against the politicians setting policy. As the Florida legislature was passing the “don’t say gay” bill and the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, was moving to classify gender-affirming care for trans minors as child abuse, a group of parents meet to push back against discriminatory legislation, share stories and celebrate. Survivors of South Africa’s devastating floods have described “sheet upon sheet of relentless rain” that washed away entire houses, bridges and roads, killing about 450 people and making thousands homeless. The storm, which delivered close to an entire year’s usual rainfall in 48 hours, took meteorologists by surprise and has been blamed by experts on climate change. The new disaster comes after three tropical cyclones and two tropical storms hit south-east Africa in just six weeks in the first months of this year. A family in California spent the winter dismissing odd noises that sounded a little like snoring, only to discover that five bears had spent the cold season hibernating under their house. The Bear League group, which works to preserve bear habitat, recounted the family’s astonishing episode last week. In a Facebook post, the group described how one mother bear, along with three of her own cubs and an adopted orphan, had decided to spend the winter in the crawlspace under a local house.

4/25/2022,"It is still early for courgettes/zucchini/zucchine, I know. That said, the new-season varieties are now starting to appear, cautiously, in shops and gardens. But don’t be fooled: soon we will be surrounded and, before we know it, there will be gluts and people will start suggesting chutney. For now, though, we are safe. The small cylindrical courgettes we know today are relatively modern, developed in the early 19th century, but their ancestors are gourds domesticated in the Andes and Mesoamerica more than 7,000 years ago. While they are classed as vegetables, courgettes are in fact a fruit, specifically pepos, which, botanically speaking, are swollen ovaries, making some sense of the fact that they can have a flaming flower attached (although the flowers that shoot from the sides on stems are male). I suppose it is transportation that makes it hard to preserve the flowers. If you have them, they could be added to, but are not needed in this week’s recipe, which is zuppa di zucchine, a Neapolitan speciality from the Campania chapter of Anna Gosetti della Salda’s huge and wonderful compendium, Le Ricette Regionali Italiane. I have tried it with three varieties of courgette. First, the very pale green and bulbous Lebanese cousa, which are fortunately quite easily found in Middle Eastern grocers and have an almost sweet flavour and succulent flesh that collapses into softness. Next, I made it with light-green ridged romanesco, which has creamy, almost nutty, firm flesh, so retains more shape. And, last, with the familiar dark-green variety with bouncier flesh that collapses during long cooking. All worked well, but the nicest of the three was the one made with the dark-green variety. However, I think the taste had more to do with the fact it was a cool but sunny day; we ate with the doors wide open, so maybe that should also be a serving suggestion. Whatever variety you use, one thing is certain: 700g of courgettes, chopped into quarter-moons, is quite the pile, but it shrinks considerably as it cooks. So I add potato, to give a slight thickness to the soup. Once the vegetables are soft, the next step is similar to Chinese egg-drop soup or brothy Roman stracciatella, in that, just before serving, you stir in beaten eggs and cheese, which meet the heat and cook into wispy rags that thicken and enrich. For this soup, though, I suggest that, after turning off the heat, you wait a minute before adding the egg mixture: this way, the whisked eggs and cheese will cook gently into a cloudy curdle. To make the soup, top and tail 700g courgettes, quarter lengthways and then into 3mm thick quarter moons. Peel and dice a medium potato. Warm the oil in a large heavy-based pan and cook two finely diced shallots until they are starting to soften. Add the courgettes, potato and a pinch of salt and cook, stirring often, for about five minutes. Now add 1.4 litres water or light stock, raise the heat to bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer for 40 minutes. While the soup cooks gently, cut a couple of thick slices of white bread into cubes and put them on a baking tray, zigzag with olive oil and bake until gently toasted and golden. In a small bowl, whisk together two eggs, three tablespoons of grated parmesan, two heaped tablespoons of chopped basil, a pinch of salt and a good amount of freshly ground black pepper. Pull the soup from the heat, wait 60 seconds, then add the whisked mixture and stir. Divide between bowls and top each with croutons, and more parmesan if you like. There will be little indecision, I’m sure, about this soup. If you’re not a fan of egg drop, scrambled egg or long-cooked courgettes, I doubt you will have read this far. If you are, I hope you try making it and enjoy the way the willo-the-wisp curdle clings to the courgettes. Don’t leave out the basil: the heat of the soup wakes the scent of what is already a purposeful herb. Loud basil is a good thing here.

4/25/2022,"As the closing bell rings at Jordan high school, a cacophony of adolescent chatter nearly overpowers the mechanical noises that emanate from the metal recycling plant next door. Students hardly register the lustrous dust – laced with lead, chromium and other contaminants – that settles into the blacktop as they rush out the front gates. For generations of Jordan students, the mounds of scrap metal behind campus are a familiar sight. The high school opened in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts in 1923, while the plant, owned by S&W Atlas Iron & Metal Co has been there since 1949. “Nobody really complained about it, because I guess we just kind of had to get used to it,” said Diana Salvador, who graduated from Jordan high in 2019. But she’s horrified when she thinks back. “We would sit outside, eating lunch while they were throwing scrap pieces around. And we were breathing that air – inhaling lead.” It’s only in recent years that local authorities started to grow concerned – linking toxic contamination on school grounds to the piles of metal detritus next door. Lab testing in 2020 commissioned by the school district and state authorities found dangerous levels of lead – a neurotoxin – and other heavy metals in the school’s softball field and inside classrooms. Test results reviewed by the Guardian revealed concentrations several times higher than what the US government considers safe for children. Now, two lawsuits could push Atlas out, and allow Jordan high students to breathe a bit easier. In 2020, the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) sued Atlas in federal court. Although the recycler denies responsibility for contamination on campus, blaming other potential sources, LAUSD contends that Atlas, and its barrage of metal projectiles and toxic emissions, is an imminent threat to the school. And last year, the city of Los Angeles filed suit against the recycler as well, alleging that Atlas is in violation of health and safety codes. But in an industrial community where children have become inured to a daily deluge of pollution, residents are dubious that anything will change soon. Watts – a predominantly Black and Latino neighborhood in south LA – is built atop land seeped in industrial contamination and bordered by two congested freeways. Recycling plants, lumber yards, auto shops, fabricators and warehouses adjoin playgrounds and churches. Just east of Jordan high, the Alameda corridor, a 20-mile (32 km) freight expressway vibrates, with a noxious stream of rail and truck traffic flowing between the two busiest ports in the country. Here, the average life expectancy is 12 years shorter than it is in wealthier parts of Los Angeles – in part due to the pollution. According to California’s office of environmental health hazard assessment, the area where Jordan high is located suffers environmental burdens – from dust, diesel fumes, toxic waste and water contamination – in the 99th percentile compared to the rest of the state. “It is kind of evil to continue to add pollution to neighborhoods that are already struggling so much,” said Heaven Watson, a junior at Jordan. “But it’s like, what can you do? This is a low-income neighborhood.” Among her group of friends, she said, “two out of three of us have somebody in our family with some type of condition due to pollution”. Fatima Iqbal-Zubair, a former teacher at Jordan high who is now running for state assembly on an environmental justice platform, said it crushed her to see how accustomed her students were to the signs plastered at school, and around the neighborhood, warning them to beware of contamination. “I would literally tell them, ‘No, this is not normal’,” she said. “This is not a normal way to live.” Across the country, low-income children of color are most likely to be exposed to harmful air pollution at school. Local leaders said that the Atlas facility is part of this legacy of environmental racism. In a community that is already contending with so many hazards, the Atlas recycling plant “is like a big slap in the face”, said Tea Vickers, an organizer with the Better Watts Initiative, a local environmental group. The facility is a half-block compound, heaped with piles of crushed up car parts, steel tubing and metallic detritus. The materials are dismantled to salvage copper, steel, aluminum and other metals that can be refined and reused in manufacturing. The business markets its service as a way for individuals and industries to reduce their carbon footprints, keep reusable metal out of landfills and preserve natural resources. Sourcing aluminum or copper from scratch results in far more carbon emissions than using recycled metals, but the recycling process can be messy and ultimately toxic. Teachers, students and school administrators said the facility’s operations can be distracting – and dangerous. Watson said the noise from Atlas has, at times, drowned out her physics lectures. Salvador, who lives in the housing projects right next to Jordan high and Atlas, said that when she first moved to the area, she’d wake up to the noise each morning, panicking that there had been an earthquake. On occasion, the shards of scrap metal have zoomed onto the blacktop where students play pickup basketball, and where the high school’s military training program runs after school drills. At the boundary between the school and Atlas metals, in the softball field, Watson said she has spotted nails and small pieces of broken glass. The school’s field was renovated in 2020 but until this month, games were being held at opponents’ schools, where the players could bat and field without having to brace for errant metal shards. A fence affixed with warning signs, cutting through the third baseline, recently came down after school officials cleaned the area and worked with Atlas to reduce the risk of projectiles. As an extra shield against projectiles, Atlas had erected a stack of shipping containers behind the wall that separates it from the school. But the school district countered that the improvised barrier made students less safe. “What if they had toppled over?” said Carlos Torres, director of LAUSD’s office of environmental health & safety. The most alarming issue remains lead-laced dust that drifts across campus, according to students, administrators and community members. Unsuspecting students might breathe in trace amounts as they shuffle through the school day, or drag some home on the frayed edges of their Y2K revival jeans. Teachers and school staff have described the dust as a “purple shimmer” in court documents, and the school district alleges that it emanates from the heaps of shredded metals at Atlas. Lab testing has confirmed that the dust is as insidious as it appears. Testing commissioned by LAUSD, and reviewed by the Guardian, revealed lead concentrations up to 790 micrograms per square foot in dust samples taken from classroom floors – more than 75 times than what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines as a hazardous threshold. The state’s department of toxic substances control (DTSC) also found elevated lead and heavy metal concentrations in outdoor areas around the school. Soil and dirt samples collected from the softball field and near the batting cages contained lead concentrations of 400 parts per million (ppm) or higher, which the EPA considers a hazard. In dirt samples taken from Atlas’ facility, DTSC found lead concentrations of up to 10,000 parts per million (ppm). Lead-based paint – which the US banned for consumer use in 1978 – is a common source of contamination on older school campuses across the country. But at Jordan high, lead and other heavy metals including cadmium were discovered inside classrooms constructed in 2013 and in fields that had already been cleaned and renovated – leading the school district to link the contamination to Atlas’ operations. Lead is especially toxic to children because it can affect the development of their brain and nervous system. Studies have found it can lead to cognitive and behavioral issues, hinder children’s attention span and their ability to do well in school. Even small amounts of lead in a child’s bloodstream can cause damage, said Martha Dina Argüello, the executive director of Physicians for Social Responsibility-LA. “And it causes permanent damage, damage that children will carry for throughout their entire lives.” Emissions from metal recycling plants can also add to particulate pollution from vehicle emissions and exacerbate respiratory conditions including asthma. Mary Ann Cortez, who lives a few blocks from the Atlas facility, said the dust that penetrates her carpets and clouds her windows terrifies her. Cortez’s eldest daughter, who recently graduated from Jordan, has asthma, and her middle daughter is beginning to develop respiratory issues as well. “We’re in a community where it feels like you’re incarcerated, where you have to live with all your doors closed and windows pulled because of the pollution,” she said. Atlas Metals has been involved in some form of litigation with the school district and the city for five years now, but it has been in conflict with the school for much longer. In 2002, a Navy shell that Atlas was dismantling exploded, launching a chunk of metal onto Jordan’s campus. In the subsequent years, DTSC and the EPA ordered Atlas to clean up 1,400 cubic yards of soil and debris along its border with Jordan high, after the waste piles were found to contain hazardous levels of lead, zinc, chromium, arsenic and other contaminants. After decades of complaints, “just the fact that we’re having to have a conversation about air quality and soil samples and the noise in our classrooms is really disheartening”, said Lucía Cerda, Jordan high school’s principal. “We shouldn’t have to do so much advocacy just to make sure our students are safe.” Between 2017 and 2020, the school has spent more than $2.4m to test, treat and monitor contamination on campus. Portions of the campus have been cleaned and treated two or three times, said LAUSD’s Torres. “And they’re continually getting recontaminated – it just really crushes me.” The two lawsuits are seeking damages from the recycler for violations of health and safety codes. Ultimately, said Torres, the school could come to a deal with Atlas, and help the recycler move to another location – potentially away from the school. Atlas has argued the district’s claim that the recycling facility is the source of contamination “is factually groundless”. Matthew Weisenberg, who owns Atlas, noted that no sampling can directly link the dust at Jordan high with Atlas. In an industrial community such as Watts, there are several potential sources of particulate pollution and heavy metal contamination, he said. “To blame Atlas for all the school’s contamination problems ignores the current and past realities of this neighborhood,” Weisenberg said in a statement to the Guardian. The school has countered that even if laboratories cannot confirm the provenance of toxic dust, tests conducted by the DTSC have found elevated levels of the same heavy metal contaminants at both the Atlas facility and the school, with no known sources other than the metal recycler. And even if Atlas isn’t the sole source of contamination in Watts, it’s clear that the facility is a part of the problem, said Timothy Watkins, president of the Watts Labor Community Action Committee. It’s a “blight,” he said – a glaring, ugly reminder of the neighborhood’s toxic legacy. “We just shouldn’t have a metal salvage operation next to a school. And we wouldn’t have in Beverly Hills or Bel-Air,” he added. Atlas “should get the hell out of Watts”. Relocating the plant will not be straightforward. Part of the problem is that few areas exist in California that are near enough to major transport corridors, but far enough from communities. Moreover, many local residents are defensive of Atlas as a longtime family business, and one that has provided employment or income to many in the community. The company’s owners prop up local causes, donate to local sports teams and sponsor community events. It’s not uncommon to find people running errands in Atlas-branded t-shirts. Jacquelyn Badejo, director of the Watts Clean Air and Energy Committee, a local advocacy group, points out that Atlas, and the Weisenberg family, have been a part of Watts for decades. She sees the push to remove Atlas against a backdrop of change and redevelopment in Watts, which she and other long-time residents worry could displace Black and brown families. In recent years, a $1bn revitalization project has brought in new, sand-hued apartments and a 115,000 square-foot shopping center across from the high school – with plans to build more new housing underway. Badejo and others wonder if the city and school district are cleaning up the neighborhood under the auspices of environmental justice, while seeking to attract more private developers and wealthier, whiter residents. “It’s really just a part of gentrification,” she said. Watson, the Jordan high junior, said she vacillates between thinking of the mounds of scraps that peak over the school’s fence as an eyesore – and contending with what it means for her health. Fumes from the facility sometimes seep into the classrooms, and students jokingly call it the scent of “sewer rat”. Watson said she usually avoids dwelling on what exactly she’s breathing in, but more and more, her anger is creeping in. “It’s not an anger that’s mad, but an anger that makes me want to do something,” she said. “Something has to change.”",News/US news,This high school is contaminated with lead.

4/25/2022,"The faces of two clearly exhausted adults appear on a screen at the front of the room. They wish to be identified only as parents from Texas. “I don’t know what I look like on your end,” the mother says, “but I know I look like death on my end, so it can’t be good on the Zoom screen.” Her description of her appearance matches the mood in the room at the Human Rights Campaign headquarters in Washington DC where about two dozen parents of trans kids sit in a large semicircle. They’re here for an annual weekend of HRC Parents for Trans Equality Council (PTEC) meetings, a group organized to give a voice to parents of trans kids in advocating to the media and elected representatives. Tonight’s meeting couldn’t have been better timed. I was there on 11 March 11 to listening in on a roundtable. This was right as the Florida legislature was passing the “don’t say gay” bill and the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, was moving to classify gender-affirming care for trans minors as child abuse. Across the country, more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been filed this legislative year, according to HRC. Most of them target transgender children, a demographic not even old enough to vote against the politicians setting policy. A few weeks after the PTEC gathering, Alabama passed a series of bills that essentially make it illegal to be a trans minor in the state. I doubt it will be the last state to do so since this has become the de facto big issue for the US conservative movement – and Democrats seem reluctant to fight back too forcefully. The woman on the screen goes on to explain her attorney advised her not to publicly advocate for herself or her trans child, and that her family took down all outward displays of support for LGBTQ+ people, like the Pride flag outside their home. “It feels really bad to hear from people across the country that we just need to leave Texas because our experience here is not what we experience in the legislature,” she says. “We have an affirming community, [and] we don’t experience discrimination in a way that so many people do in other states and in other areas of Texas.” Balancing raising their families while also advocating on behalf of their children’s lives is weighing heavily on all of these parents. Jose Trujillo, father of a trans boy in Arizona, speaks about how he sacrificed to become a naturalized citizen so that his kids could have freedoms that he didn’t have before becoming a citizen. But now, he lives in a state that introduced more anti-trans bills than any other in the country. “I felt what it feels like to not be sort of an outcast,” he tells the roundtable. “I’m thinking when I have my children and they’re born in this soil, they’re gonna have a completely different experience. And then I see this happening and it just makes me angry.” Over the phone days later, Jose’s wife Lizette, told me their 14-year-old son had what she called a “typical” transgender childhood. Early on, she gendered her kid a lot, pushing pink and princesses, but her child instantly rejected it. At eight, she remembers a friend of her kid running up and asking: “Hey can he and I go play in the soccer field?” “The friend’s mom corrected her son. “And the friend looked at us and said, ‘No, he’s a he, can we go play?’” Lizette recalled. That interaction prompted her to broach the topic with her child who told her that in his heart he is a boy. “From that moment on, we supported him,” she said. Initially they were met with resistance from some family and friends. A close friend of hers warned against telling anyone about her son’s gender identity, for fear of Child Protective Services being called on the family. It took eight months for Lizette to find a support group to help start working through it all. Thankfully, her son’s school was supportive and had experience with other trans children, wiping a big worry out of Lizette’s mind. She cut some family members out of their lives to protect her son, though many have eventually come around on it. “It was really painful to have your child, this person that you would give your life for, to have them rejected by people who are supposed to love them,” she said. “I took that very hard, very personally. Why wouldn’t you love him?” Another parent, Stephen Chukumba, from New Jersey, is one of the most vocal of the group. “I have a trans son and I’m really upset that in 2022, three months in, six transgender people have already been killed, and states are actively moving to further marginalize transgender people as if we are some huge threat,” he say, his voice ringing with emotion. “It doesn’t seem that enough people are taking what’s happening to us seriously, and it bothers me, it angers me, it upsets me and it frightens me.” A week later, over Zoom, Chukumba, a widower and single father, told me gender wasn’t a big deal in his household. All four of his kids – boys ages 20, 18, 15 and 12 – have long dreadlocks and have always dressed in fairly gender non-descript ways. His 15-year-old, who Chukumba didn’t want to name for privacy reasons, came out as trans five years ago. Chukumba said that it was often easier to take the kids to Osh Kosh B’Gosh and buy them all T-shirts and slacks, including his trans son before he transitioned. As a result Chukumba would find himself correcting strangers who often perceived all of his kids were boys. His trans son later told him that he didn’t mind being called one of the boys. “Thinking back to it, he never, ever corrected people,” Chukumba said. “ He would just go along with it.” He recalled a moment from about a year ago when his son’s identity finally clicked for him. His son knocked on Chukumba’s bedroom door and asked to come in. “I’m like, ‘What do you want?’” he recalled. “He just kept staring at me and a little smile crept across his face and literally in that moment was the first time I saw my son. Like I saw just the dude. I didn’t see the assignment at birth.” It was a critical moment for Chukumba, he realized then that he needed to start preparing the teenager for life as a Black man. He said he’d always told his cis sons to do push-ups around the house, so he he started to include his trans son. He also realized he had never taught the trans teen to dap up – greeting one another with a fist bump. “No child of mine is not going to know how to dap up another brother,” he said. “I had been derelict in my responsibility in raising a Black male child not showing him how to be appropriate in situations with other Black men.” At the PTEC meeting , Chukumba provides the emotional backbone of the evening’s discussion. “It’s quickly becoming apparent that there is no safe space for us, and how is that tenable?” He asks late in the discussion his voice crackling as he begins to cry. “I’m already dealing with intersectionality with Black trans child and now I have to think about what states can you live in. I will have to accept that somebody could decide that you represent something that they hate and that’s it.” As I’m packing up my things after the roundtable ends, a group of parents asks me to join them for dinner. We laugh and talk over Italian food in downtown DC, which feels like a respite from the hostile world outside. Shortly after the appetizers, one of the parents stands up, phone in hand. “The judge enjoined the Texas action!” he yells, referring to a decision by a local judge in Texas to put Abbott’s child abuse order on hold. Cheers go up in our section, and tears are shed. After an evening of long, hard, emotional testimony by a group of loving parents who feel beaten but not defeated, it was a much needed victory. Chukumba had perhaps best articulated earlier in the evening the fight that lies ahead for both trans people and the parents who love us. “With the last sinew in our body, with the last breath, we will fight to make sure our children have a place in the society where they can stand with their heads held high, not afraid, knowing they’re entitled to the same rights and liberties that everybody else has in this world,” he said. “I just refuse to just allow this shit to go down without a fight.”",News/US news,‘It is painful to have your child rejected’: the parents group fighting new anti-trans laws,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/us-parents-fight-anti-trans-laws
4/25/2022,"In 2019, French travel writer Sylvain Tesson published The Art of Patience: Seeking the Snow Leopard in Tibet – an account of his travels with the equally renowned wildlife photographer Vincent Munier, searching for the near-legendary snow leopard, as well as foxes, bears and other marvellous animals in the stunningly stark and remote landscape. This is the film which Munier was co-directing at the time with Marie Amiguet about their experiences together, with music by Warren Ellis and Nick Cave. The relationship between the two men could easily have been an insufferable teaming-up of macho guys congratulating themselves on their superiority to big city folks and their primal connection to magnificent beasts (and all films like this stand in the shadow of Herzog’s Grizzly Man). But their images have real power, particularly those showing the animals’ mysterious existence in and then emergence from camouflage. Tesson often praises the monkish austerity of Munier’s modus operandi, as he waits for weeks and months in a “blind” in which he may or may not be able to photograph his quarry. “Waiting is prayer,” Tesson says, although he doesn’t reflect on the now ubiquitous use of the camera trap, that modern invention for wildlife specialists which takes the discomfort – and possibly the prayer – out of waiting. In Tesson, the film has a real writer whose style rises above the cliche into which nature documentary almost always descends. I enjoyed this documentary for the way it keeps human beings within the picture and doesn’t create a world in which animals exist on their own, with the humans’ presence saved for the making-of featurette section in the last 10 minutes. There is real wonder in the snow leopards’ eventual appearance.  The Velvet Queen is released on 29 April in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Velvet Queen review – powerful hymn to the land of the snow leopard,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/25/the-velvet-queen-review-snow-leopard-photography-documentary
4/25/2022,"In September 2015, Simon was working at the University of Birmingham and running an Effective Altruism group. “It’s a movement that assesses charities, giving people information and advice about how and where to donate,” he explains. When Simon saw the Facebook guest list for the first event of the new term, he spotted Ben. “So I recognised him when he arrived but I pretended not to know who he was, as that might seem weird,” he laughs. Ben was a student in a different part of the university. “I’d been involved with an Effective Altruism group at home in Exeter and decided to carry on in Birmingham,” he says. When he was introduced to Simon, he thought he seemed “quite serious and knowledgeable”. Although they had a good conversation, it wasn’t love at first sight. “Ben seemed quite nervous,” says Simon. “It was just a general chat about the group and what we were doing.” They gradually became friends through meetings and socials. “On Bonfire Night, I suggested a group night out but it ended up being just the two of us. I was nervous as we’d never done anything one-on-one before, but we went to a fairground and had a really nice time,” says Simon. “It just felt comfortable,” adds Ben. Towards the end of the year, something shifted, and the pair developed more of a romantic attraction. While celebrating the success of the Effective Altruism group, they shared a hug. “It went on for just a little longer than a friendship hug and I detected something more,” says Simon. A few days later, he invited Ben to his room to look at a decal on his wall and they kissed. Although they liked each other, neither wanted to be in a serious relationship over the summer holidays. Instead, they kept things casual until the autumn of 2016. Simon recalls: “I had a date lined up with someone from Tinder, but realised that I really didn’t want to go – I just wanted to be with Ben.” He confessed how he was feeling and Ben said he felt the same way. “I was ready for it to be a serious thing by then and so we officially became a couple,” says Ben. Although neither of them had previously wanted to marry, they got engaged in March 2019, on a trip to Kenilworth Castle. “My opening gambit was about the pension benefits we would get,” Simon says. “But I think I was just looking for an excuse to propose because it felt right.” After Covid delayed their initial plans, they’ve now arranged a wedding in Oxford for next year. They moved to Bicester at the end of 2019, where they live with their cat, Seth. “We moved in together three months before lockdown, which is the acid test for any relationship. We got on really well, though, and barely bickered at all,” says Simon. He now works as a lecturer in medical ethics at the University of Warwick, while Ben is a software engineer. The couple are excited to start travelling again, one of their shared interests. “We’ve got a big trip to the US coming up,” says Ben. Simon has never met anyone as kind as Ben. “He’s very sweet and understanding,” he says. “I’ve been a bit unwell recently and he treats me so well in my worst moments. Ben is quite anxious but it never stops him doing things. He just feels the fear and does it anyway, which I admire.” Ben loves how well his partner takes care of him. “I have some mental-health problems and he is very understanding and gives me all the space I need. And he makes me thousands of cups of tea,” he says. “Simon always makes it very clear how much he loves me, which I really appreciate.” Want to share your story?

4/25/2022,"A Ukrainian refugee has been left homeless just days after moving in with a host in Brighton who demanded money from her to pay for utility bills. Olha, 36, who asked for her real name not to be used, moved in with her host who had registered with the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme. But she was told to leave when she said she was unable to pay the money her host demanded. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities source said it was not acceptable for hosts to demand money from Ukrainian guests. Hosts can claim £350 a month from a government fund to cover the costs of hosting Ukrainian refugees. The deputy leader of Brighton and Hove city council, Hannah Clare, confirmed the council was aware of the case and condemned the government hosting scheme. “The government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme has been badly put together. Among its flaws is the fact that there is no mechanism for councils to transfer a Ukrainian guest to an alternative sponsor when something like this happens,” she said. Olha, who was working in finance and economics before the war started, matched with a British woman in her 60s via a Facebook group and had registered with the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme. She fled her home in Dnipro on 28 March and began a dangerous and harrowing journey out of Ukraine by car. She arrived in Brighton about two weeks later. At first Olha thought things would go well with her host. She provided her with an evening meal when she arrived, but told her she would be expected to provide her own food after that. But soon the host started demanding money and said Olha was costing her a lot in utility bills. “She contacted the utility companies, asked them how much she had spent that week and told me that since I had arrived her energy bills had gone up a lot and that I needed to pay her £50 per week for energy bills. She said if I didn’t want to pay her I had to leave,” said Olha. “I felt so upset I thought it would have been better for me to stay at home in Ukraine so that I wouldn’t experience anything like this.” She left her host’s home and has managed to find someone from a local church who offered to let her stay with her for a few days. “I’m in a very difficult situation because my family are still in Ukraine. My brother is a soldier and my mother has refused to leave the country. I’ve received contradictory information about what I should do next. I don’t want to scare other Ukrainians who are coming here but what happened to me is dreadful. It has caused me so much stress and made me feel totally unsafe. My host told me I needed to go. But where should I go? I have only just arrived in the UK.” According to the latest government data 6,600 people have arrived as part of the Ukraine sponsorship scheme with 39,300 visas for the initiative granted. Another 15,000 people have arrived under the Ukraine family scheme with 32,500 of these visas granted. Advice on the government website said sponsors should inform their local council if a hosting arrangement breaks down. Clare said: “We are sadly aware of this really unfortunate situation. We understand that the woman in question is safe and has been helped by a local community group to find another place to live temporarily. We will do what we can to offer her support. “Homes for Ukraine is a private matching scheme that is not mediated by councils. We have warned all along of the risk of some relationships breaking down and inappropriate hosts taking part due to a lack of proper oversight by the government. “The scheme is at its heart deeply flawed. Councils have no control over when Ukrainian guests arrive in the city, nor do we get adequate notice. We rely on information from hosts about when refugees are arriving. With this in mind it isn’t possible for councils to carry out property and welfare checks before guests arrive.”",News/UK news,Ukrainian refugee left homeless after UK host demanded bill money,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/25/ukrainian-refugee-left-homeless-after-uk-host-demanded-bill-money
4/25/2022,"When the boss of a big theatre company stands down it is usually the cue for change or continuity. In the case of Greg Doran – who has resigned as artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company but will keep his links with it as a director emeritus and a verse specialist – I hope it will be both. The RSC urgently needs a reboot. And some things are worth preserving. Doran’s greatest achievement during his 10-year tenure has been overlooked: he revamped the idea of the Shakespeare repertory. His grand scheme was to present each of Shakespeare’s plays within eight years (it stretched to 10 because of Covid). Pre-Doran, a Stratford season would be built around the bankable hits with a few oddities such as King John or Timon of Athens thrown in. That meant that popular plays such as A Midsummer Night’s Dream or Twelfth Night would come round every two or three years, thus forcing directors to find ever more extravagant variations on over-familiar texts. Doran democratised the rep by ensuring that each play had only one production within the cycle so that Much Ado had no more exposure than Measure for Measure. Doran did many other things. He directed some fine productions, of which King Lear, Death of a Salesman (both with his late partner, Antony Sher) and The Tempest stand out. He saw the theatrical potential of epic novels such as Hilary Mantel’s Thomas Cromwell sequence and Robert Harris’s Cicero trilogy. He also increased the number of female directors, gave black and Asian actors lead roles and was open to incorporating non-professional talent. Doran deserves credit for all this. But I would argue that the RSC desperately needs two things: a permanent London base and the capacity to combine ensemble work with blood-stirring star casting. When it comes to the choice of Doran’s successor, I have a radical idea. Why, for once, should the company not be led by an actor rather than a director – someone who combines a passion for Shakespeare with an ability to attract lustrous colleagues? It is not without precedent – as Laurence Olivier at the National Theatre and Mark Rylance and Michelle Terry at Shakespeare’s Globe have proved – and it could mean more emphasis was placed on actors’ performances than directors’ concepts. Two names come to mind. One is Adjoa Andoh who, if she could be prised out of Bridgerton, would be a charismatic and inspirational leader. I base this on the work I have seen her do on stage including an astonishing Richard II, of which she was the star and co-director and which boasted an all-female cast of colour, at Shakespeare’s Globe. My other candidate would be Simon Russell Beale who is a proven Shakespearean and possesses the kind of inquiring mind that any theatrical organisation needs. Would other actors not want to join a company led by either of these? I realise the RSC governors are more likely to play safe and choose a director, in which case I would put forward four names. Simon Godwin, whose record includes an RSC Hamlet and a National Theatre Antony and Cleopatra, would be a frontrunner, although he is currently based in Washington DC. I also have great faith in Blanche McIntyre, whose dazzling production of Titus Andronicus in the RSC’s 2017 Roman season was one of the best Shakespeares of recent times. Owen Horsley, whose current productions of the Henry VI plays at Stratford have won him golden opinions, seems to possess the qualities of a natural leader. And Erica Whyman, who is currently acting artistic director of the RSC, has the advantage of being in situ. But I go back to my original point. The RSC cannot simply stand still. It needs the kind of permanent London base it so wantonly discarded. It also should once more become a magnet for the most exciting talent in the land. How to achieve that? By overturning expectations and putting a lead actor in charge.",Arts/Stage,It’s time for the Royal Shakespeare Company to be led by an actor | Michael Billington,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/25/royal-shakespeare-company-gregory-doran-rsc-adjoa-andoh-simon-russell-beale
4/25/2022,"Nadine Dorries has criticised Jacob Rees-Mogg, the minister responsible for Brexit opportunities and government efficiency, of foisting a “Dickensian” approach to working from home on the civil service. Rees-Mogg, who has previously been called “the honourable member for the 18th century” has written to cabinet ministers urging them to coerce staff into a “rapid return to the office” and has been leaving notes in empty Whitehall workspaces with the message: “I look forward to seeing you in the office very soon.” Labour MPs called the move “patronising” and “passive-aggressive”. Rees-Mogg presented figures to cabinet last week showing that some government departments were using as little as 25% of office capacity in early April. Dorries’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport was at 43%. The culture secretary said Rees-Mogg’s letter to government departments brought to mind “images of burning tallow, rheumy eyes and Marley’s ghost” in reference to Charles Dickens’s A Christmas Carol. She said: “There’s a whiff of something Dickensian about it. Why are we measuring bodies behind desks? Why aren’t we measuring productivity?” The Times reported that several other cabinet ministers had reservations about the plans to force civil servants back to the office, and that some permanent secretaries had also raised concerns. Dorries and Rees-Mogg have previously disagreed about the need to return to places of work after the lifting of coronavirus restrictions. But a government source told the PA news agency that the dispute between the two was “good natured”. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said Rees-Mogg’s approach would mean that “good people will leave and the civil service brand is trashed in a highly competitive employment market”. He said: “It sends a signal that he simply does not understand how modern offices work. He doesn’t understand … what’s happening across the economy, not just in the public sector.” Rees-Mogg used a Mail on Sunday article to say officials may lose the London weighting on their pay or see their jobs moved elsewhere if they were not at their desks. “Those who are at their desks every day seem to be younger, hardworking and ambitious civil servants, often renting house-shares in London for whom the office provides the right environment for work. “Meanwhile, others enjoy the fruits of their London weighting at home in the shires. As the minister responsible for government property, it is my job to ensure the government estate is run efficiently and commercially. Empty offices are a cost to the taxpayer. “Essentially, if people are not back in their office it will be fair to assume that the job does not need to be in London,” he said. Internal HR policies obtained by the Daily Mail said working remotely could not be used as a way to avoid paying for childcare or put in fewer hours, and that there would be penalties if people’s performance was found to be suffering. Oliver Dowden, chairman of the Conservative party, defended Rees-Mogg’s approach in a Sky News interview. He said: “As we learn to live with Covid, I think if we really want to serve the British people best, one of the things we need to do is have that collaboration, that kind of sharing ideas that comes from working in the office. “So, Jacob’s efforts are driven by getting the very best value for taxpayers and I support him in doing that.”",News/Politics,Dorries criticises Jacob Rees-Mogg’s ‘Dickensian’ approach to working from home,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/25/nadine-dorries-jacob-rees-mogg-dickensian-working-from-home
