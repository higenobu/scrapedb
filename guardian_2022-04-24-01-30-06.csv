4/24/2022,"Andre Esterhuizen’s late try ensured Harlequins signed off their final match of the season at the Stoop in style – and boosted their chances of returning here in the playoffs. Esterhuizen struck down the right five minutes from time to settle an entertaining if error-strewn victory over the league leaders Leicester Tigers. Marcus Smith added a cathartic late penalty for good measure and Harlequins are now level on points with second-placed Saracens and in the mix for a home semi-final. The Tigers will not be overly disappointed with the outcome given Steve Borthwick again opted to rotate his starting lineup and it is still hard to see how Leicester will not finish top of the pile at the end of the season. They could have made sure of a home playoff here but they have European ambitions to juggle as well and they may well get the chance to avenge this defeat over the road at Twickenham at the season finale given how these two sides are performing in the Premiership run-in. Leicester began with the wind at their backs but just as they did against Montpellier last week, Harlequins struck early with the opening try. A concerted period of possession, with Smith opting to kick for the corner, yielded its reward with Alex Dombrandt running a trademark line and offloading to the tighthead prop Will Collier to score next to the posts. The Tigers wasted little time in responding however, Nemani Nadolo crashing through a limp tackle from Louis Lynagh and dotting down. It came against the run of play and Harlequins soon reasserted themselves, adding try No2 despite appearing to waste a glorious overlap on the left. After a few more phases Smith was over but the referee Wayne Barnes ruled it out for obstruction on his opposition number George Ford. No matter for the home side who had advantage, opted for a scrum from which Smith fizzed a pass to Cadan Murley to score on the left. Smith shanked the conversion at the same end as his costly miss against Montpellier. Leicester grew into the match thereafter, buoyed by a fine 50:22 from Freddie Burns, and after a mazy run from the lively Matias Moroni, Hanro Liebenberg registered the Tigers’ second score of the day. Ford was off target with the conversion before a Smith penalty edged Harlequins ahead – a lead they took into the interval after weathering a late Leicester surge which included a bizarre penalty when it appeared Callum Green was in a spot of trouble for a high tackle on Joe Marler. Again Harlequins began the half brightly after the restart but after just five minutes Borthwick turned to his bench and replaced no fewer than four forwards, introducing Ellis Genge, Dan Cole, Harry Wells and Jasper Wiese. It made an instant impact at scrum-time and after Ford kicked a penalty to the corner it was Wiese who powered over from close range to give the visitors the lead. Harlequins thought they had recaptured the lead after a moment of brilliance from Smith released Lynagh down the right but his right foot was adjudged to have been in touch under close attention from Liebenberg. A Smith penalty from in front of the posts did nudge them a point ahead, however, and a missed penalty from Ford – albeit into the wind – boosted the home side’s chances of holding on. Barely a minute later, however, the Tigers were given another go from closer in and Burns, taking over kicking duties from Ford made no mistake. By now, though, we have learned that it is a fool who writes Harlequins off and Esterhuizen powered his way over in the right-hard corner – reward for his tireless carrying up the middle all afternoon. Smith was wayward with the conversion but on target with a penalty with the last kick of the game to rubber stamp the victory.",Sport/Sport,Andre Esterhuizen leaves it late to help Harlequins sink leaders Leicester,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/harlequins-leicester-premiership-rugby-union-match-report
4/24/2022,"Donald Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows was warned the effort to overturn the 2020 election with fake electoral college votes was not legally sound – and yet proceeded anyway, the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack said Friday. In a court filing, the panel also said that Meadows went ahead with plans to have Trump speak at the Ellipse rally that descended into the Capitol attack, only days after being expressly told by the US Secret Service that there was potential for violence on 6 January 2021. The 248-page court filing could serve to increase the legal exposure for Meadows. It aims to portray Meadows as someone who was instrumental in trying to overturn the outcome of the election that Trump lost to Biden. The allegations, based on testimony from a former White House staffer, Cassidy Hutchinson, suggested that Meadows knowingly acted in an unlawful manner. Hutchinson testified that Pat Cipollone, who was the White House counsel at the time, told Meadows and Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani that the scheme to have states send Trump slates of electors to Congress in states that he lost in the 2020 election was not legally sound, the panel said. Hutchinson testified that she heard White House attorneys tell Meadows and other officials – including “certain” but unspecified congressmen – that trying to certify a Trump win in that manner “did not comply with the law” and “was not legally sound”, the filing said. Nonetheless, it said, Meadows “participated in a widely publicized call” with the top election official in Georgia – the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger – “and other related efforts seeking to change the election results” there. Hutchinson, who worked in Meadows’ office, also testified in a separate deposition that Meadows knew about the potential for violence on 6 January 2021 after being briefed on intelligence reports by the Secret Service. “I know that people had brought information forward to [Meadows] that had indicated that there could be violence on the 6th,” she said. Hutchinson said Meadows had been presented with the warnings either one or two days before the Capitol attack took place. She said former White House chief of operations Anthony Ornato delivered them to Meadows in his office. “We had intel reports saying that there could potentially be violence on the 6th,” Hutchinson told the select committee in the first of her two depositions, one in February and another in March. “But despite this and other warnings,” wrote Douglas Letter, the general counsel for the House of Representatives, in the court filing, “President Trump urged the attendees at the January 6th rally to march to the Capitol to ‘take back your country.’” The select committee’s investigation into the Capitol riot and its aftermath has been investigating whether Trump and his staffers illegally conspired with the extremists who stormed the Capitol as Congress was certifying Biden’s presidential victory. It has also been examining whether Trump and members of his administration broke federal laws prohibiting obstruction of a congressional proceeding, which in this case would be the interrupted certification session. As part of that probe, the committee subpoenaed records from Meadows’s cellphone service provider, Verizon, among others. Though he has turned over at least some communications to the committee, Meadows sued to stop those subpoenas, portraying them as “overly broad and cumbersome”. The select committee included excerpts of Hutchinson’s testimony in an effort to persuade the district court in Washington DC to reject that lawsuit. If granted, the select committee’s motion for summary judgement could finally cap a protracted legal battle with Trump’s final White House chief of staff. It has detailed the numerous ways Meadows was involved in Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, including the scheme to put forward “alternate” slates of electors for Trump in states that he lost. The aim of the scheme, the Guardian has previously reported, was to have then-vice president Mike Pence declare at the joint session of Congress on 6 January 2021 that he could not count states with slates for both Trump and Joe Biden, and return Trump to office. “The select committee’s filing today urges the court to reject Mark Meadows’s baseless claims and put an end to his obstruction of our investigation,” the panel’s chair, congressman Bennie Thompson, and vice chair, congresswoman Liz Cheney, said in a statement. Much of the panel’s new revelations late on Friday cited testimony from Hutchinson, who was present for key discussions in the White House in the weeks before the Capitol attack. Hutchinson testified after she was issued a subpoena in November. She also recounted how the White House counsel’s office had threatened to resign if Trump went ahead with an extraordinary plan to seize voting machines and assert emergency presidential powers over false claims of election fraud. “Once it became clear that there would be mass resignations, including lawyers in the White House counsel’s office – including some of the staff that Mr Meadows worked closely with – you know, I know that did factor into his thinking,” she said of Meadows. The former Trump White House aide, who served as special assistant to the president for legislative affairs, testified that some members of Congress, such as Scott Perry, who is now the chair of the rightwing House Freedom Caucus, supported sending people to the Capitol on 6 January 2021. Testimony from Hutchinson and other aides also corroborated a Senate judiciary committee report that found Trump unsuccessfully sought the imprimatur of the justice department to bolster his claims of election fraud. Meadows initially cooperated with the inquiry before abruptly withdrawing his assistance last year. He turned over a trove of evidence that included an email in November 2020 discussing appointing alternate slates of electors, and others about overturning the 2020 election. But he then proceeded to withhold more than 1,000 other messages on his personal phone over executive privilege claims, the filing said. He also refused to appear for a deposition, reversing a cooperation deal agreed between his lawyer and the select committee. In response, the House referred Meadows, who was the top official in the Trump administration, for prosecution for contempt of Congress, though the justice department has yet to issue charges.",News/US news,Mark Meadows was warned of illegality of scheme to overturn 2020 election,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/23/mark-meadows-2020-election-capitol-attack-trump
4/24/2022,"At least this result prevented Aston Villa from losing five successive games again, the week before they are reunited with Dean Smith who was dismissed in November after a similar sequence. While Steven Gerrard could find solace in stopping the rot, Leicester were able to welcome Jamie Vardy back with a late substitute’s cameo appearance as they prepare to face Roma in Thursday’s Europa Conference League semi-final first leg. Villa’s improved defensive showing, in their first goalless draw of the season, means they can welcome Norwich City with the pressure off next week, while the verdict on Leicester’s season will depend far more on their first European semi-final than this mid-table derby. The biggest cheer of the first half came when Vardy, back on the substitutes’ bench after more than a month out with a knee injury, ventured out to warm up. To say it was a quiet first half would be an understatement, but after Villa’s run of consecutive defeats, this probably suited Gerrard down to the ground. Reverting to fielding Ollie Watkins as a lone striker, Villa played with a much more compact shape than in recent games, restricting themselves to a half press, with Philippe Coutinho doing defensive doggy runs between James Justin and Youri Tielemans rather than sparkling intermittently at the tip of a diamond. Yet it was Villa who had the best chance of the half, in the eighth minute. Watkins did well, picking up a misheaded clearance from Wesley Fofana, whose vision was affected by the bright sunshine, and driving past the defender to reach the byline from where he pulled the ball back for Leon Bailey. The less said about the winger’s wildly lofted shot the better. There was similar drive and poise from Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall at the other end but, from his centre across the six-yard box, Justin fouled Ashley Young in attempting to finish. In stoppage time, James Maddison swerved just wide the free-kick he won off Young before Tyrone Mings headed over at the other end from Douglas Luiz’s corner as Kasper Schmeichel claimed he was impeded. Villa, in their first draw away from home of the season, looked heartened by this tightening up and came out sharply in the second half. Watkins got away from Fofana again but dragged his cross-shot wide; then went at Timothy Castagne down the inside-right channel and pummelled a shot that rebounded off Schmeichel’s chest for a corner. Leicester responded. It was Vardy time. But Villa coped well with the former England striker’s reintroduction and finished the game strongly, dominating possession in the opposition half before Emiliano Buendia, on as a substitute, shot wide from a rare sighting of goal.",Sport/Football,Jamie Vardy returns for Leicester but Aston Villa hold firm for draw,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/23/leicester-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report
4/24/2022,"When you sing and it’s your job, if you get a cold, it’s kind of the end of the world. I’ve never had to cancel a gig because I’ve been ill – so far, I’m touching wood now – and if I’m on tour, I have garlic for everything. Raw garlic, I’ll chop it up, put it in hot water and drink it. Maybe stir in some manuka honey, apple cider vinegar, ginger, in one disgusting concoction. Oh, it has to be manuka. If someone just tried to put one of those plastic bears in front of us … I don’t know what they measure it in – it’s like the Scoville scale for chilli – but 20 is a good manuka. And if you get a 40 or 60, you know that’s really good. I’ll just have a teaspoon before the show and maybe another before the encore. I’m sure my dentist isn’t really happy about it, but it gives you a little boost. Growing up, we didn’t run out of money, but we had no spare money. My mum was cleaning houses and then she started working at a primary school. Packed lunches towards the end of the month would have slightly different foods in. You might have a sandwich and then one day just crackers and cheese. Then the last week of the month our packed lunches got really posh because we always got stuff from Marks & Spencer. I remember saying to my mum, “Why did we always have Marks & Spencer packed lunches for the last four days of the month?” And she said: “Oh, that’s when my paycheck would be running out … but I had a Marks & Spencer credit card.” So suddenly we would have these fancy iced buns. My biggest food coming of age happened with music. Suddenly there were these people who were older than me and had, in those days, a record company budget to just burn through. I remember going to the top of the Pompidou Centre in Paris and the starter was half a jacket potato with I couldn’t see any prices on the menu, because none of the numbers on the menu related to what I could imagine people spending on food. caviar. And I remember our guitarist saying, “I’d like to have that as well,” and the record company woman was like, “No!” But at the end I saw the bill and I was like: “Oh no, that was €180!” Both times after I’d just had my babies, I had them at home and being in a bed for days/weeks, a really good friend of ours who used to be a chef made pistou [a cross between a soup and a stew, packed with vegetables and beans]. When I was at a low ebb, [my husband] Steve would just give me three massive ladles of it. I was so tired after I’d had those babies and I’d just eat it. You know they say food sticks to your bones? It was just iron-rich gorgeousness. I went to Stevie Wonder’s church in Los Angeles and we went for lunch [with him] to an Ethiopian restaurant. It was so fascinating watching a person eat who doesn’t see, because Ethiopian food you eat with your hands, dipping that thin, spongy bread into these different piles. And it’s actually so sophisticated to eat with your hands because before you put the food in your mouth you’ve got a sense of the texture, the temperature, the resistance, the size and so on. It was a way of “seeing” the food, not just having something on a metal fork and not knowing what it is until it goes to your tongue. Our band is really into cooking: we have an actual Crockpot on the tour bus. People make dal and that lasts a few days and one of the band used to be a chef. So we always eat well and we’re all not 25, right, so we can’t survive on beer and crisps. FoodI probably eat way too much pasta, but a garlicky, fishy pasta is just a dream thing to me.

The way the fish has been sliced, it’s like it’s giving you superpowers and everything. Dish to makeThe style of cooking I like to do is quite hands-off, really. You know, the casserole world. I’m not very good with the timing of stuff. I’m like, “Well, that’s done, this thing’s cold, this won’t be ready for half an hour …” I can’t pull it all together. I really admire people who do that.

4/24/2022,"One of the BBC’s longest-running and most internationally respected news programmes, Dateline London, is to be ditched at the end of the summer. The move, confirmed to the show’s producer this weekend, is the first in a series of billed “radical changes” planned by the broadcaster. To the surprise of the programme’s production team and panel of high-profile contributors, the show will end in September, just as it marks its 25th continuous year on air on the BBC’s News and World channels. “It’s pretty clear the BBC has decided it wants to make substantial changes to the news channels,” said Nick Guthrie, who has edited the programme since its beginning and who still hopes for a reprieve. “It’s an iconic brand that offers a unique perspective,” he added. “The show was recently described by [former Democratic presidential candidate] Hillary Clinton as an ‘oasis of sanity in a very troubled world’. And [former BBC Trust chairman] Chris Patten once called it ‘the jewel in the BBC’s crown’. I may be biased, but it would be a tragedy to cancel it now, as audiences cry out for clarity. The contributors have been told it is doomed and are not happy either.” In response the BBC is promising that Dateline London’s particular mix of comment and expertise, often drawn from outside the corporation’s own staff, will be on offer elsewhere in its television schedules. The programme, with a global audience of 10-15 million, was initially presented by Charles Wheeler, the late revered foreign correspondent, and was broadcast for 50 minutes on Sunday mornings. It now fields a range of political and foreign affairs panellists with varying perspectives, including Janet Daley, of the Sunday Telegraph, Bronwen Maddox, of the Institute for Government, Polly Toynbee, of the Guardian, and David Aaronovitch of the Times. Contributors from foreign press organisations regularly include names such as Thomas Kielinger, of the German newspaper Die Welt, and Vincent Magombe, of Africa Inform International. The loss of Dateline London, which is made for the BBC by Guthrie’s company TV Talk, is an early taste of a programme of cuts that is likely to affect all programming over the next two years. The BBC’s annual plan, released three weeks ago, laid out a requirement to make an extra £285m in annual savings before 2027. They will come on top of the last round of cuts, to broadcast services, which saw the loss of 500 BBC jobs in news alone. While the BBC plan warned of the upcoming and necessary “reduction in the content and services”, the decision to axe Dateline London is not regarded internally as part of a cost-cutting drive. News managers described it as part of a “healthy modernisation” of news presentation. The emphasis will instead be, they say, on providing analysis through fresh formats, including John Simpson’s new chatshow, Unspun World, and The Context, a new programme presented by Christian Fraser. Early positive responses to Simpson’s show have been encouraging, according to news bosses, although Guthrie said he suspects that economies are really behind the changes. He pointed out that when BBC staff interview BBC colleagues, they are not allowed to share their own views. “Dateline London is the only news and current affairs discussion programme on British TV which provides a glimpse of ‘how others see us’,” he said. “Its guests’ opinions are not restricted. If you don’t have that window for informed opinion, comment is left to extremists on other channels and streaming services.” Guthrie, who joined the BBC in 1968 and left 30 years later, said he has been making the show for £70,000 a year, providing 182 hours of good-value broadcasting over a year. It is presented by News Channel presenters, which this year would include Shaun Ley, Martine Croxall and Geeta Guru-Murthy, and so is cost-effective, he argues. A BBC spokesperson said that Dateline London has been a “key part of the BBC News Channel schedule, having informed debate and brought context to world events to our viewers for many years”. “But the 24-hour channel, the spokesperson added, constantly reviewed its output: “As the channel’s output has evolved, we now have a number of programmes that offer a similar experience to our audience.” Guthrie still hopes that when the BBC’s new head of news, Deborah Turness, arrives this summer, she will listen to his plea: “I am asking for a stay of execution and a chance to implement a new version.”",News/Media,BBC set to pull the plug on Dateline London after 25 years of news debate show,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/23/bbc-set-to-pull-the-plug-on-dateline-london-after-25-years-of-news-debate-show
4/24/2022,"Taking on Putin (Black Dog Woof! Woof!)Fighting for Ukraine PodbeanNever Have I Ever With Joel Dommett and Hannah Cooper Global The veteran journalist John Sweeney is a man born to broadcast. Emotional, dogged and funny, with a strong moral sense and fantastic way with words, he has been reporting for years, notably for the Observer and the BBC’s Panorama strand. A natural iconoclast, Sweeney’s outspokenness has, on occasion, got him into hot water (he left Panorama after some spiky run-ins with supporters of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, AKA Tommy Robinson). Because of this, there’s always been a sense of him being too outré for traditional outlets: too direct, too bumptious, too partial, too much. But these days, news is different – more direct, bumptious, partial etc – and Sweeney is stepping into his own spotlight. He went straight to Kyiv as soon as the Russians invaded, and he’s been there ever since, occasionally popping up on news outlets in his distinctive orange woolly hat, and making his own excellent – if strongly worded – filmed reports for Twitter. (Someone recently compiled a selection of orange-topped Sweeney saying: “Fuck you, Putin.” It happens a lot.) He is a war reporter who delights in being on the ground. And now, rightly, he’s making a podcast. Eighteen months ago he made Hunting Ghislaine, a great six-parter about Ghislaine Maxwell. Now he has turned his attention to, yes, Putin, with Taking on Putin. I’d rather have had a daily Sweeneycast from Kyiv, but, really, we can get that from his Twitter feed, and this show gives him a chance to demonstrate his vast knowledge and great contacts. Even if you’ve already absorbed Radio 4’s excellent Putin series, or any of the many other “who/what/why is Putin” podcasts out there, Sweeney’s take is definitely worth a listen. He weaves the Russian leader’s past with snapshots from today’s war. He pulls up old recordings of him doorstepping Putin – “my voice is high because I was scared” – to ask questions about the 2014 shooting-down of Malaysia Airlines flight 17. He even makes the very well told tale of the murder of Alexander Litvinenko into something different, likening the particular radiation poisoning used to different types of salad dressing. It was, says Sweeney, like garlic. Very easy to identify. We’re three shows in, and the punchiness hasn’t stopped. A great listen from an alternative national treasure. For another take from the ground in Ukraine, I highly recommend Fighting for Ukraine. These are short, regular dispatches from another experienced war reporter, Yuriy Matsarsky. The difference is that Matsarsky is now a soldier, fighting for his country. This podcast is unlike anything I’ve heard about the war; weirdly, it reminds me of Alastair Cooke’s Letter from America. Matsarsky has the same reporter’s eye for revealing detail. He wonders why the Russians always leave their battle positions in such a filthy state. He describes his scooter, making reference to Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday, to Phil Daniels in Quadrophenia. He speaks of how he can’t read news reports because his brain is too fried. How he communicates with reporters from other countries through a few short jokes, for the same reason. And – sadly, by describing the anti-Ukrainian barbarism of the Russian troops – he also disabuses us of the idea that the war has only one bad guy, sitting at the end of his long golden table. Sometimes, Matsarsky drops out of making his podcast for a few days, because he’s been sent to a different area in Ukraine to fight. But his words remain in my head. There is no way to segue smoothly from this to Never Have I Ever, a new podcast from The Masked Singer host, comedian Joel Dommett, and his wife, model Hannah Cooper. This podcast has been heavily promoted, with billboards all over the shop, and is clearly designed to be a husband-and-wife hit in the manner of Shagged Married Annoyed. But there’s a concept: the Dommett-Coopers try out a new activity every week! Hmm. It’s telling that they have to visit strip clubs or try puppy yoga in order to have something to talk about. None of the so-called action is in the show (there are a few online clips), so it’s just them recalling what went on, and this mostly seems to be Dommett feeling a bit jealous of his lovely wife giving any other living thing – a personal trainer, a male stripper, a puppy – some attention. It’s all sweet enough, but the banter never gets above lukewarm. So, this show is not for me. Still, they clearly love each other, so I hope they enjoy expanding their hobby horizons, maybe to something that’s not based around the body beautiful. Next week’s suggestions are going to church, trying a life drawing class or colonic irrigation. (Betcha any money it’s the last one.)",Arts/Television & radio,The week in audio: Taking on Putin; Fighting for Ukraine; Never Have I Ever,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/23/taking-on-putin-john-sweeney-review-fighting-for-ukraine-yuriy-matsarsky-never-have-i-ever
4/24/2022,"Arnold Schwarzenegger has the answer to tackling the climate emergency. Don’t hype the economic damage, he says, just say we need to “terminate pollution”. It may seem odd to pick the former bodybuilder and actor turned Republican politician as someone with the answer to the most important issue of the 21st century. But Schwarzenegger’s focus on pollution as California’s governor, and that of his successor, the Democrat Jerry Brown, means that since 2008, by wide agreement, the Golden State has enjoyed the longest economic expansion in its history, while also cutting emissions. The contrast with other parts of the world – including much of the US, where climate change is discussed in the gloomiest terms, and usually as a massive cost to businesses and households – is stark. When it comes to debating climate change, the key argument is not “the economy, stupid”, or the decline in biodiversity. The answer is to focus on pollution and its impact on everyone’s health. To illustrate the point, Ipsos Mori found in a poll of public attitudes, timed to coincide with Earth Day last Friday, that concerns about climate change were beaten into eighth place by “not having enough money”, fears of terrorism and the threat of crime. Top of the list, in a poll covering 31 countries and 23,577 adults aged 16 to 74, was the subject “your health and your family’s health”. This suggests that if climate action can be linked to wellbeing, the campaign to reduce emissions is on to a winner. That’s not to say that economics cannot play a role in convincing households that the way we make and sell goods and services needs to change. One important reform would be to the way the state and economists report on the “success” of economic policies, and especially economic growth. The Treasury, the Bank of England and the Office for Budget Responsibility all measure economic success based on growth in the Office for National Statistics’ measure of national income – gross domestic product (GDP). There has always been a problem with a gross measure of national income because it fails to distinguish between useless, and in many cases destructive, activity, and the manufacture and sale of things that benefit society. Critics argue that GDP fails to account for the degradation of the environment caused by economic activity. This month, MPs on the environmental audit committee said greenhouse gas emissions should be published alongside quarterly economic growth figures to help measure the UK’s progress towards net zero goals. In letters to the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the UK’s national statistician, Sir Ian Diamond, the committee warned that the narrow scope of GDP means it “fails to acknowledge other indicators such as environmental statistics and social capital”. This demand signals an advance on previous efforts to create a dashboard of measures that includes biodiversity loss and the degradation of the landscape. Such dashboards can create a blizzard of seemingly contradictory figures, encouraging the Bank, Treasury and OBR to continue focusing on GDP, if only because it remains the most popular shorthand for economic success – if not economic health. More radical is the proposal from the Cambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta, who recently reviewed the issue of climate change and policymaking for the Treasury. He said in a report last year that GDP encouraged the pursuit of “unsustainable economic growth and development” by not taking into account the impact on natural assets. Dasgupta has been in talks with the ONS since his report was published to change the way GDP is calculated. Instead of a dashboard, he wants a single “net” measure that takes into account the emissions created to generate growth. Emissions are relatively easy to calculate and there is a vast amount of literature showing how to do it. Net domestic product, or NDP, would then become the basic measure of economic success, because only when the “depreciation of assets” is taken into account can we judge whether we have made progress. On 12 May, when the ONS publishes the latest GDP figures, it will reveal plans “for projects feeding into the creation of a measure of inclusive income”. But when the planet is frying and pollution is increasing, the timetable is likely to be far too slow. Years could pass before there is any tangible reform. The ONS – like the Bank, OBR and Treasury – is a natural follower, not a leader. As if trapped in an episode of Yes, Minister, each asks the other to go first. Maybe they would be under more pressure to junk GDP in favour of NDP if more people accepted Schwarzenegger’s message that emissions create pollution – and pollution is bad for their health.",News/Business,The key to winning the climate debate isn’t economics: it’s health,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/23/key-to-winning-climate-debate-isnt-economics-its-health
4/24/2022,"This is not about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars last month. Nobody needs to read more about that. It’s swimming in cold water, it’s how good Succession is: we know, so why hasn’t anyone mentioned it before? But that one rash moment and its afterlife is part of a bigger picture, a sense that something is not quite as it was. Last week, the Hollywood Reporter revealed that the organisers of the Tony awards, the New York ceremony that recognises excellence in Broadway theatre, sent an email revealing they now have a policy for dealing with violent incidents: “In the event of an incident, the perpetrator will be removed from the event immediately.” The Tonys, back for the first time since 2020 and celebrating its 75th year, draws no direct connection between this and Smith’s actions in March, but surely this has to be the first time that an entertainment awards ceremony has needed to explicitly state that you’re not allowed to perpetrate an act of violence while clapping for Moulin Rouge! The Musical. This protocol is aimed at an audience largely made up of professionals; while I have witnessed how heated feelings can become over whether this or that person more deserved their shiny trophy, the idea that there has to be a plan now for dealing with the possibility of that spilling over into violence is odd, isn’t it? Live entertainment in all forms, cut off during the pandemic, given little support in this country by the government, is now attempting to scratch and claw its way back in a near-impossible landscape. The audiences that feel brave enough to attend events may find themselves in a different world. Comedians talk about a mood shift, post-lockdowns, with audiences behaving badly; last week, Nish Kumar spoke of racist hecklers at his stand-up shows and said other comedians agree that “there’s something in the water”. In an Instagram video, the musician Adrianne Lenker, of the brilliant band Big Thief, said: “Try to be mindful of what’s happening and pay attention and don’t talk.” Trying to manage an audience’s behaviour is difficult. It exists on a sliding scale: a sign requesting that a crowd does not take photographs is not the same as an artist berating an audience for not clapping loudly enough, which I have seen before. But after a period away, this seems like a period of great readjustment, in which everyone is trying to find their feet. At least, that is one way to see it, if you want to remain hopeful. I have written before about how television became a comfort blanket for many over the course of the pandemic, and those big event series such as Bake Off and Strictly were particularly soothing. On a personal level, I’d add MasterChef to that, and MasterChef: The Professionals, although if the former doesn’t implement a ban on fondant potatoes in the early rounds soon, I may switch off in protest (it’s the new scallops, black pudding and pea puree). Monica Galetti, the tough but fair judge on The Professionals, whose praise is usually the hardest earned but the most valued, announced last week that she is leaving the show, after 14 years. “It is with a heavy heart that I have made this decision to step back from filming this year’s series of MasterChef: The Professionals,” she said, though the “this year’s series” allowed for a little sliver of hope that she might return one day. She explained that she felt unable to balance filming the show with her family life and her London restaurant. “Those in the hospitality industry know just how tough it is at the moment,” she said. There is something sturdy about MasterChef and its offshoots. It is a reliable perennial, despite the odd attempt to tweak the format, and newcomers to food TV, such as Gordon Ramsay’s bizarre Future Food Stars, just cannot compete with its familiar elegance. Monica leaving The Professionals is like Oti leaving Strictly or Mary Berry, Mel and Sue walking away from the Bake Off. It feels like more than just a personnel rotation and I hope that she comes back soon. I have never been to the New York International Antiquarian Book Fair, taking place this weekend, though I am imagining it as a kind of Glastonbury for bibliophiles, with all the hedonism yet none of the regrets. The star of this year’s fair, the Pyramid stage headliner, if you will, is Charlotte Brontë, played in the film To Walk Invisible by Finn Atkins, right. In 1829, nearly two decades before she would write Jane Eyre, a 13-year-old Brontë compiled A Book of Ryhmes [sic], a handwritten collection of 10 of her poems, sewn into a miniature book, a little smaller than a deck of cards. It is reassuring that even one of the most celebrated authors of all time could not spell rhyme correctly and I love the teenage petulance of its title page: “Sold by nobody and printed by herself,” she wrote. The “sold by nobody” is no longer the case. Last Thursday, it reportedly sold for $1.25m (£973,500) to a private collector. This beats the highest price previously paid for a printed work by a woman of $1.17m, for a first edition of Frankenstein in 2021. Funnily enough, that is about what I would pay someone not to read my attempts at writing poetry as a teenager.

4/24/2022,"Max Verstappen won the sprint race for the Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at Imola and in doing so secured pole for Sunday’s race. The Red Bull driver won the 21-lap dash after brilliantly taking the lead on the penultimate lap, beating Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc into second, with Sergio Pérez in third for Red Bull. Lewis Hamilton and George Russell, still struggling with their Mercedes car, could manage only 14th and 11th respectively. With Mercedes still off the pace the battle at the front remains between Ferrari and Red Bull, and really between Leclerc and Verstappen. With eight points for the sprint win Verstappen has clawed back a single point to Leclerc who now has a 45-point lead over the world champion. For Mercedes another trying afternoon lies ahead on Sunday. Off the pace here their car has been experiencing severe porpoising – the bouncing on straights as the car’s underfloor aero loads and unloads – making it an absolute handful to drive. Both Hamilton and Russell struggled to make any headway through the field, unsurprisingly with a tricky can on a track where overtaking is far from easy. They had brought minor aero updates to Imola but clearly solving their issues remains some way off. Their car is quicker than this form suggests but they face a tough task battling in the midfield on Sunday. Leclerc made an electric start, jumping Verstappen who was on pole into turn one, with the safety car called shortly afterwards on the opening lap as Guanyu Zhou went off after contact. Hamilton however went backwards, dropping two places to 15th. Racing resumed on lap five, Leclerc holding his lead and swiftly opening up over a one-second lead. Back in the pack Hamilton however took time to pass the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll to edge back a place but it was far forward as he would go. Meanwhile Pérez did well to move through from seventh to fourth within nine laps. He was third several laps later, an impressive run and vital for Red Bull so he can play his part in the race tomorrow. Carlos Sainz too came through the pack well from 10th on the grid. He made some impressive, decisive moves to take fourth by the close. Out front however while Leclerc was in control, Verstappen closed in the final four laps to within a second. It was tense as Verstappen edged nearer with DRS. Pressuring Leclerc the pair were nose to tail until Verstappen made a beautiful pass round the outside of Tamburello on the penultimate lap, as the Dutch driver enjoyed greater grip from his tyres. It was a bravura move, perfectly executed and the sort of racing the sprint race has long needed. Back on top, Verstappen held his place to close it out for the win, claim the front of the grid and with formidable form going into the race. With the victory Verstappen has secured pole for Sunday a potentially vital achievement at Imola where overtaking is difficult. However given the torturous way F1 has constructed the sprint race meeting format, it is not counted as having taken pole position with that honour going to the quickest driver in Friday’s qualifying (and in this instance where Verstappen did indeed also claim pole). This unsatisfactory and torturous format, means it is conceivable that the driver who claims pole position, could start the race from a spot much lower down the grid, while the driver who is on the front of the grid, indeed on pole for the race, is being referred to as in “P1”. Last season drivers and fans were unhappy that the quickest time in qualifying was not rewarded by being recorded as having taken pole, so F1 has adjusted the format but the insistence on still making the sprint race set the grid has led to a disagreeable and confusing compromise. Ferrari have said they are likely to let their Russian test driver, Robert Shwartzman, participate with the team at F1 meetings using an Israeli licence this season. “At the moment he’s still our test driver and he will remain as that,” said the team principal, Mattia Binotto. “If we have in the future any opportunities to let him drive, we will probably let him drive. Robert is born in Israel, he’s got an Israeli passport.” The 22-year-old could participate in two Friday practice sessions this year. Russian drivers are not banned from taking part in F1 but must compete as neutrals and sign a commitment not to express any support for the country’s invasion of Ukraine. Before the season began Haas dropped F1’s only Russian driver, Nikita Mazepin.",Sport/Sport,Verstappen overtakes Leclerc to win F1 sprint race and take pole at Imola,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/23/max-verstappen-overtakes-charles-leclerc-to-win-f1-sprint-race-at-imola
4/24/2022,"In the days since Erik Ten Hag’s unveiling as Manchester United’s next manager the talk has turned, hungrily, to the scale of the task. There is a kind of relish in this. How many years are we talking now? What’s the current bid? I hear five. I hear six. How about 10 years. How about 100 years. How about infinite years. It is a pointless discussion. Partly because it has no content, nothing but numbers plucked out of the air. Let’s face it, if you’re walking in the wrong direction you’re not going to get there at all. But there is also something deeply facile about hiring a first-team manager as a kind of balm. Fix us. Give us “a culture”. Make us like Ajax, while having none of the structures that make Ajax into Ajax. In many ways, bolting Ten Hag on to this ailing machine is up there with buying a replica shirt in the hope it might turn you into Johan Cruyff. Yet as Arsenal extracted from this fun, slightly delirious game a potentially season-defining result, led by the reliably excellent Bukayo Saka; as United thrashed away without any luck at all, it was tempting to wonder. The 100-year plan, the doom-scenario talk is rooted in an obsession with moral decay, physical cowardice, all the things people love to pick out of the theatre of sport. Is it really this complex? Moments of theatre. Scorelines. The last thing you’ve seen. All of this has a powerful intoxicant effect. But this is basically a game of talent and money. And the world’s fifth-richest football club still has a large helping of both. United may have scored six by the hour mark. They kept hitting bar, post and goalkeeper. They offered, even in an error-strewn 3-1 defeat, evidence of the low-hanging fruit a coach as organised and as focused as Ten Hag may yet be able to scoop up. At this level so much rests on clarity and fine margins. Most telling here was the start, a moment that seemed to capture something of the hysteria around this team. Never mind Total Football. This was Total Non-Football. Total entropy. Total collapse. United had started slowly. Eventually, Diogo Dalot gave Granit Xhaka space to hang a cross into the area – not whip or ping, just doodle one in. It was too much for the defenders, as first Raphaël Varane and then Alex Telles produced synchronised air clearances, a Folie Bergères matinee, all high-kicking grace, as the ball trundled through to Saka. Saka cut inside. This is a tautology. Saka always cuts inside. But knowing he’s going to do it isn’t the same as having the balance, the twitch in your feet to get near him. Saka shot for the far corner. David de Gea saved. The ball fell to Nuno Tavares, unbothered by Dalot, who watched as Arsenal’s left back tapped it into the net. Ralf Rangnick had looked relatively chipper at kick-off, with that air of the demob-happy boarding school housemaster looking forward to spending more time with his jazz records. As the goal went in he turned and just frowned, a man caught in the wrong movie. This has turned out to be a startlingly bad appointment: a process manager at a club with no process whatsoever. Not to mention a manager who is so clearly out of step with this kind of player, this kind of environment. United’s director of football, John Murtough, was responsible for this farcical interim appointment. At a sensible club he would be answering for it – the lost millions, the dead end to the season – with his own job. With 28 minutes gone it was time for episode two, another helping of defending-style product from the Manchester United Entertainment Company. A series of mistakes led to Victor Lindelöf fouling Saka as Eddie Nketiah scored from an offside positions, providing a consolation penalty. It arrived via a strange VAR check, Mikel Arteta doing a kind of celebrity Gogglebox alongside the referee, Craig Pawson. Saka scored to make it 2-0. The odd thing was either side of this, United had been tearing Arsenal to shreds. Yes, really. Jadon Sancho began taking big hungry chunks out of Cédric Soares. Cristiano Ronaldo – who was excellent – scored. United continued to miss chances, but to play with genuine vigour and enterprise. Bruno Fernandes missed a penalty and then lost the ball for Granit Xhaka’s brilliantly struck third Arsenal goal. Such is the Manchester United noise it is easy to lose sight of the fact this was Arsenal’s afternoon by a mile. Victory is a huge result. Performances can wait. This is about outcomes. They have reached that point of crisis. Either the slow steps, the weeding out, the bad days have all been part of an overarching plan, or that many‑sided die falls the other way and the Arteta mini-era will be deemed another dead end, another false illumination. It is a perfect measure of how delicate those margins are, how arbitrary some elements of this race. The Manchester United Industrial complex would do well to remember that fact. This sport offers plenty of agony, but also the chance for endless renewal. Even in the midst of a 90 minute wake for United’s league season, there was evidence of life here. The trick for Ten Hag will be to capture that, to seal it off, to make it bloom.",Sport/Football,Manchester United show signs of life but Saka helps make it Arsenal’s day | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/23/manchester-united-show-signs-of-life-on-arsenals-afternoon
4/24/2022,"The city of Mariupol is now effectively in Russian hands. Although some Ukrainian troops continue to hold out at the Azovstal steelworks, the Russians have felt able to redeploy the forces used to assault the city. They leave behind an apocalyptic landscape that in many respects stands as a symbol of Russia’s strategic failure in Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin set out to reanimate a Russian empire but has instead found himself master of a wasteland above ground and a mass grave beneath. That Mariupol would be a target for the Russian military had been obvious since 2014, when Russian proxies initially seized the city and tried repeatedly to retake it after being driven out. A major industrial centre and port on the Sea of Azov, Mariupol would be economically vital to any annexed territory and in any case was on the main supply route from Rostov into southern Ukraine. The Russians assigned a significant force to take the city, though their composition shows that it was not Russia’s primary objective. The siege was prosecuted by troops from the 150th Rifle Division and 810th Naval Infantry Brigade reinforced with Chechen Rosgvardia and conscripted fighters from occupied Donetsk. The Ukrainian military judged correctly that it would neither be Russia’s primary objective, nor easy to defend. Kyiv was the vital ground in the initial phase of the war, and with very limited stocks of anti-tank missiles and air defences the Ukrainian military prioritised these for the capital. Trying to hold Mariupol would have meant fighting for a corridor to resupply the city, fixing Ukrainian forces into a killing area within range of Russian artillery. Ukrainian troops in Mariupol were tasked with holding out for as long as possible so that Ukraine might live. In a war that has defied many expectations, the fighting in Mariupol conformed to conventional analysis. The Russian military surrounded the city on 2 March and proceeded to pin Ukrainian defenders into isolated pockets which could then be assaulted in turn. The Russians employed massive artillery fire to wear down the defenders, destroying most of the city in the process. In 1999 the Russians took six weeks to seize Grozny. Mariupol, with a slightly larger defence force, has been subjected to the same fate in seven. The Ukrainian general staff had feared it would fall sooner. That Ukrainian forces held out for as long as they did testifies to the ferocity of the defence. Ukrainian troops in infantry fighting vehicles outmanoeuvred and defeated Russian tanks. Infiltration parties ambushed and destroyed Russian supply columns. Ukrainian helicopter pilots flew daring shuttles to drop off key supplies of food and ammunition. Supplies proved the critical bottleneck. The Russians repeated their playbook from Syria. Strikes on hospitals and civilian shelters were used to terrorise the civilian population into evacuating. Driving the population from the city cleared the battlefield, allowing the Russians to concentrate against the defenders. The will of the defenders to resist was also bolstered by their expectations of what Russian troops would do to them if they were taken prisoner. Mariupol’s defenders were made up of marines and members of the Azov battalion, a unit associated with a far-right political party and containing a significant proportion of neo-Nazis. Russian propaganda has used this unit to characterise the entirety of the Ukrainian military. Given that Russia declared the war to be a campaign of denazification, Azov members expected no quarter. With emerging reports of mass graves and atrocities, their fears appear justified. The siege of Mariupol holds a number of military and political lessons. From the military perspective it underscores why the Ukrainians must prevent cities from being isolated. Once cut off from supply, the defence can only last so long. The siege also highlights why attacking Russia’s logistics is vital. The Russian military has enough artillery ammunition to keep up a continual bombardment equivalent to that unleashed on Mariupol for five years. The constraint on that firepower is Russia’s ability to move the ammunition to the guns. The political lesson from Mariupol, however, is that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is an act of futility. Russia will have to level Ukraine’s cities if it wishes to occupy them. Underscoring the nonsense of Russia’s whole invasion is that among the troops sent to “denazify” Mariupol, many of Russia’s soldiers wore neo-Nazi insignia on their uniforms. As the Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno reportedly told fascist officers in 1936: “You will win, because you possess more than enough brute force, but you will not convince, because to convince means to persuade.” Mariupol tells us that any Russian victory in Ukraine will be hollow.
