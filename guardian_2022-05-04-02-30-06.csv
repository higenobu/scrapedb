Charlie Appleby’s Godolphin operation is steadily moving onto O’Brien’s turf, however, and his colt New London (3.10) will be an odds-on shot to extend his unbeaten record to three races on the Roodeye on Wednesday. New London has posted a useful time without being extended on both of his starts to date and was cut to third-favourite for the Derby after readily seeing off eight opponents in a novice event at Newmarket’s Craven meeting. He shortened again for the Classic without leaving his box on Tuesday when Reach For The Moon was ruled out of Epsom and while O’Brien’s runner, Changingoftheguard, was a six-length winner at Dundalk last time, he still has something to find with the favourite.

5/4/2022,"More than half of US states will outlaw abortion immediately or as soon as practicable, if a leaked draft decision from five supreme court justices remains substantially unchanged. The result would send hundreds of thousands of people in 26 states hostile to abortion elsewhere to terminate a pregnancy – either by traveling hundreds of miles to an abortion clinic or seeking to self-manage abortion through medication from grassroots or illicit groups. Many would also be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term. “Abortion is an essential part of reproductive healthcare, and this is going to effect people, even people who think, ‘I will never have an abortion,’” said Dr Nisha Verma, a Darney-Landy fellow with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. On Monday, a draft supreme court decision in arguably the most contentious case in generations was leaked. The case considered whether Mississippi could ban abortion at 15 weeks gestation. The ban is highly significant because it strikes at the heart of US constitutional protections for abortion. The landmark 1973 decision Roe v Wade established the right for pregnant people to terminate a pregnancy up to the point a fetus can survive outside the womb, roughly considered 24 weeks gestation, and a legal principle called “viability”. The decision invalidated dozens of state bans, and until the court issues a final decision, prevents states from outlawing abortion before viability. A final decision is expected from the court in late June. The leaked decision in the Mississippi case, called Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, shows five conservative justices are willing to reverse constitutional protections for abortion on the grounds Roe v Wade was wrongly decided. If the decision is not substantially changed by the time a final opinion is issued, abortion regulation would be returned to the states where lawmakers across the south and midwest of the US have enacted bans in anticipation of the court’s decision. “There’s six months to two years before the dust settles,” said Elizabeth Nash, interim associate director of state issues in the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive rights research organization. “It will be chaos.” In that time, “there will be a lot of fluctuation as states are trying to implement their bans”, some of which are designed to go into effect immediately after a court decision is issued. Such state bans would likely close abortion clinics for nearly half of US women of reproductive age (41%) and increase the average driving distance to an abortion provider from 35 miles to 279, according to predictions from Professor Caitlin Knowles Mayers, an economist at Middlebury College in Vermont who has studied how the reversal of Roe would impact accessibility of abortion. This would likely reduce the rate of abortions by 20% in states that ban the procedure and increase births by 4% (birth estimates are less certain). “As was the case in the pre-Roe era, many women seeking abortions will find a way to get to the states where abortion is legal,” said Myers. “Current empirical evidence suggests that about three-quarters of women in the states that go dark will manage to make such a trip, reaching providers in soon-to-be “border” states like Florida, Illinois, New Mexico and Virginia.” Myer also works as a consultant to the Center for Reproductive Rights and Planned Parenthood Federation of America, one of the nation’s largest networks of abortion providers. Roughly 860,000 induced abortions are performed each year in the US. However, a disproportionate share of the people who seek abortions are low-income or people of color who already have children, making it more difficult to obtain an abortion. “Current evidence on the causal effects of travel distances indicates that about one-quarter of women seeking abortions will not be able to travel to obtain them and that most of these women end up giving birth as a result,” said Myers. What’s more, as women from states where abortion is illegal travel to states that allow the procedure, it could push up wait times for abortions in states where it is legal and perhaps send people seeking to terminate pregnancies even farther – like a secondary wave of medical refugees. For example, California could see a nearly 3,000% increase in the number of people whose nearest legal abortion clinic is in the state. That could increase patient load from roughly 46,000 people per year to 1.4 million per year, practically overnight. Already, most people who seek to terminate a pregnancy do so through medication abortions. Medication abortion is a two-step protocol that safely terminates pregnancies up to 10 weeks gestation. Activists have already setup networks to mail abortion pills to women in states where abortion is illegal to self-manage an abortion. However, obtaining that medication would be illicit in states where the procedure is outlawed. In addition to the immediate effects on abortion, a decision giving control of the issue back to states would also substantially alter obstetrics care. “We find these laws are so extreme, clinicians are scared to provide evidence-based care,” said Verma. “They don’t know if they’re going to be prosecuted or fined or criminalized.” Nearly half (44%) of all future obstetricians and gynecologists are trained in states where abortion could become illegal, making it difficult to train young new doctors in care for early miscarriages, which use the same skills as induced abortion, or for ectopic pregnancies. The US already has among the highest rates of maternal mortality in high-income developed nations. “This goes beyond induced abortion,” said Verma. “It’s going to affect people across the spectrum.”",News/World news,‘It will be chaos’: 26 states in US will ban abortion if supreme court ruling stands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/what-states-abortion-clinics-access-trigger-laws

5/4/2022,"Joe Biden has warned that a leaked draft supreme court ruling overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 case which guaranteed the right to abortion, would represent a huge change in America law and could imperil a wide range of other civil rights. In a historic moment that shook the US to the core and highlighted jagged social and political divisions, the court confirmed the draft was authentic but said it did not “represent a decision by the court or the final position of any member on the issues in the case”. Biden said the ruling, if handed down, would represent a “fundamental shift in American jurisprudence” and could imperil rights including same-sex marriage and access to contraception. Politico published the draft by justice Samuel Alito on Monday night. The website said the draft was supported by four other rightwingers on a panel conservatives control 6-3. On Tuesday the chief justice, John Roberts, called its leak a “betrayal of the confidences of the court” which could “undermine the integrity of our operations” and promised an investigation. Speaking to reporters, Biden said the draft ruling had ramifications for “all the decisions you make in your private life, who you marry, whether or not you decide to conceive a child, whether or not you can have an abortion and a range of other decisions [including] how you raise your child.” The draft ruling would allow states to declare abortion illegal. Biden asked: “Does this mean that in Florida they can decide to pass a law saying that same-sex marriage is not permissible, [that] it’s against the law in Florida? It’s a fundamental shift in American jurisprudence.” Protesters gathered outside the court and planned demonstrations around the country – both in support of and against abortion rights. At the court, some chanted “Abortion is healthcare” and carried signs reading “Justices get out of my vagina”, “Legal abortion once and for all” and “We won’t go back”. A smaller group chanted “Hey, hey, ho, ho, Roe v Wade has got to go”. Amid tense exchanges, barriers were erected. In a statement, Biden outlined how Democrats might fight back. First, the president said, his administration would argue Roe was based on precedent and “‘the 14th amendment’s concept of personal liberty’… against government interference with intensely personal decisions”. “I believe that a woman’s right to choose is fundamental,” Biden said. “Roe has been the law of the land for almost 50 years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.” Biden said he had directed advisers to prepare responses “to the continued attack on abortion and reproductive rights, under a variety of possible outcomes”. “We will be ready when any ruling is issued,” he said. Politico said it received a copy of the draft, which also dealt with Planned Parenthood v Casey, a 1992 case, from a person familiar with proceedings in Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a Mississippi case due to be decided this summer. The draft ran to 98 pages including a 31-page appendix of state abortion laws and included 118 footnotes. Alito wrote: “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.” He added: “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled. It is time to heed the constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” As many as 26 states are expected to enact partial or total abortion bans if Roe falls. Some Republican-run states are expected to attempt to make traveling for an abortion illegal. Democratic-run states have indicated moves to protect and help women who seek an abortion. Polling shows clear majority support for abortion access. Christian and conservative groups campaign to end it regardless. If the court overturns Roe, Biden said, “it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose. And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November.” Biden promised to sign legislation codifying Roe into law. On Tuesday, the Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer said: “This is as urgent and real as it gets. We will vote to protect a woman’s right to choose and every American is going to see which side every senator stands.” But legislative success would require reform to the filibuster, a Senate rule which requires 60 votes for most legislation. Moderate Democrats have blocked such moves on issues including voting rights. Biden himself has expressed opposition. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia, told the Guardian: “This might not be the final ruling. The justices usually confer after arguments and suggest how they would resolve a case and then the senior justices in the majority and minority work on drafts and circulate them to all members of the court.” He said: “In some cases, especially high-profile and controversial ones … justices do change their positions, as Chief Justice Roberts allegedly did” in a 2012 case in which the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, was upheld. Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor, pointed to possible wider implications. “If the Alito opinion savaging Roe and Casey ends up being the opinion of the court,” Tribe wrote, “it will unravel many basic rights beyond abortion and will go further than returning the issue to the states: it will enable a [Republican] Congress to enact a nationwide ban on abortion and contraception.” Other rights that may be at risk if Roe falls include the right to same-sex marriage, determined in Obergefell v Hodges in 2015. Charles Kaiser, a historian of gay life in the US and a Guardian contributor, said Alito’s opinion “blithely disregards past precedents”. “One passage in particular sets off alarm bells for activists who think its reasoning could jeopardize the court’s decisions legalising sodomy and the right of members of the same sex to marry.” In a sharply divided Washington, the supreme court is subject to fierce partisan warfare – particularly since Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, ripped up precedent to deny Barack Obama a third pick in 2016. Republicans confirmed three justices under Donald Trump, including Amy Coney Barrett, a hardline Catholic conservative, just weeks before the 2020 election – a move which ignored McConnell’s own posturing four years before. Biden has overseen the confirmation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman justice, but she has not yet replaced the retiring Stephen Breyer, another liberal, in a move that will not change the ideological imbalance. In the aftermath of the Politico story, Democrats pointed to the wider threat posed by the court. Adam Schiff, a California congressman and chair of the House intelligence committee, told the Guardian: “In abandoning decades of precedent, the draft opinion exposes the supreme court as no longer conservative, but now merely a partisan institution bent on imposing its anti-choice views on the rest of the country.” “This decision, if made final, will be devastating for the healthcare of millions of women, even as it is destroys any semblance of devotion by the court to the law.” Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York progressive, said: “[The court] isn’t just coming for abortion – they’re coming for the right to privacy Roe rests on, which includes gay marriage and civil rights.” Republicans welcomed the draft ruling and condemned the leak – which the top legal reporter Nina Totenberg called a “bomb at the court”. Josh Hawley, a hardline Missouri senator, called Alito’s draft “tightly argued, and morally powerful” and said of the leak: “The justices mustn’t give in to this attempt to corrupt the process. Stay strong.” Among Republican moderates, Susan Collins of Maine – who under Trump supported the appointments of Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh but voted against Barrett – pointed to a possible betrayal. “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision,” she said, “it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office.” Among women’s rights campaigners, condemnation of the Alito draft was strong. Laphonza Butler, president of the advocacy group Emily’s List, said: “It’s past time to vote out every official who stands against the pro-choice majority.”",News/US news,US shaken to its core by supreme court draft that would overturn Roe v Wade,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/03/biden-democrats-reaction-codifying-roe-v-wade-reform-scotus

5/4/2022,"The aim of EU sanctions is to “break the Russian war machine”, with measures on Kremlin oil now imminent, the president of the European Council has said, as Germany pivoted to back the move. A proposal to phase in a prohibition on Russian oil imports will be discussed by member state ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday, with the most dependent, such as Slovakia and Hungary, seeking exemptions. Those championing the ban have been bolstered by a change in approach in Germany, where reliance on Russian oil has been reduced from 35% at the end of last year to 12%. The German economics minister, Robert Habeck, has called on EU member states to show “solidarity with Ukraine” and “do their bit”. Speaking at the opening of a new liquefied natural gas terminal in the Greek port of Alexandroupolis, the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, who chairs meetings of EU leaders, said the war in Ukraine was a “moment of urgency, a moment of truth”. He said: “Our goal is simple: we must break the Russian war machine. And I am confident that the council will imminently impose further sanctions, notably on Russian oil.” The European Commission will send its proposals on a phased-in ban on Russian oil imports to the capitals on Tuesday evening ahead of a speech on Wednesday by the commission’s president, Ursula von der Leyen, in which she will lay out the details to the European parliament. Russia accounts for about 25% of oil imports to the EU, although the level of dependency varies between member states. The German government signalled this weekend that it believes it can completely phase out its use “by the late summer”. Slovakia’s economics minister, Richard Sulík, said on Tuesday, however, that his country’s dependence on oil from the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline meant it would not be able to end the flow of oil for several years. “We will insist on the exemption, for sure,” he said. Slovakia has said it needs between four and six years to convert its oil refineries to process crude from other sources, although the commission is said to consider this phase-out period as too long. Hungary’s foreign minister, Péter Szijjártó, said Budapest could not support sanctions “that will make the transport of natural gas or oil from Russia to Hungary impossible”. “The point is simple: that Hungary’s energy supply cannot be endangered, because no one can expect us to allow the price of the war [in Ukraine] to be paid by Hungarians,” he said. “It is currently physically impossible for Hungary and its economy to function without Russian oil.” As well as Slovakia and Hungary, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic are highly dependent on the flow of oil from Russia. The comments from Budapest and Bratislava reflect a desire to maximise their leverage going into the internal discussions. The latest proposed sanctions will need unanimous approval to become the sixth wave of restrictive measures applied to the Russian economy since the war in Ukraine began on 24 February. The measures are the most politically sensitive yet, with officials fearing that a sudden oil price rise could lead to soaring prices at petrol pumps, triggering protests. The commission is expected to propose a gradual phasing-out of Russian oil over six to nine months, with certain countries being permitted extra time and offered alternative supply from other member states. Poland and the Baltic states, some of Ukraine’s strongest allies in the EU, want an immediate ban, but this position has not gained traction. Meanwhile, the European commissioner for energy, Kadri Simson, said she would present a plan later this month for how the EU could replace two-thirds of its use of Russian gas by the end of 2022. Speaking in the European parliament, Simson said the EU’s executive branch was exploring how to hasten the transition from gas to renewable energy. On Monday, she had warned that a large number of European energy companies faced a decision in mid-May on whether to breach EU sanctions by paying their Russian bills in roubles as demanded by Vladimir Putin or potentially losing supply. In a speech to the European parliament, Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, hinted at his government’s concerns given its reliance on Russian gas. “We can’t simply support sanctions,” he said. “We need to ensure that we can achieve independence from Russian gas … At the same time, we need to find solutions to protect families and businesses from increased energy costs.” It emerged in a quarterly financial report on Tuesday that Uniper remains in talks with Berlin and the Russian supplier Gazprom over how to deal with the situation. Uniper, Germany’s largest importer of Russian gas, declined to comment on details of the talks, saying only that no binding assessment had been made. During a two-hour phone call with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, Russia’s president said EU sanctions were fuelling a problem with food supply in Europe. Putin also claimed that “despite Kyiv’s inconsistency and its lack of readiness for serious work, the Russian side is still ready for dialogue”.",News/World news,European Council president ‘confident’ of imminent sanctions on Russian oil,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/eu-sanctions-russian-oil-european-council-president-charles-michel
5/4/2022,"Russia has accused Israel of supporting the “neo-Nazi regime” in Kyiv as it escalates a diplomatic row with one of the few close US allies that decided not to join in sanctions against the Kremlin or send lethal military aid to Ukraine. The dispute over remarks by Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who said in an interview that Adolf Hitler “had Jewish blood” and that the “most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews”, has threatened to unsettle Israel’s careful position over Russia’s war in Ukraine. On Monday, Israel summoned Russia’s ambassador to the foreign ministry and its foreign minister, Yair Lapid, called Lavrov’s remarks “unforgivable and outrageous … as well as a terrible historical error.” Lapid wrote: “Jews did not murder themselves in the Holocaust. The lowest level of racism against Jews is to accuse Jews themselves of antisemitism.” On Tuesday, Russia’s foreign ministry doubled down on Lavrov’s words, accusing Lapid of making “antihistorical” remarks about the Holocaust that “largely explain the course of the current Israeli government in supporting the neo-Nazi regime in Kyiv. “Unfortunately, history knows tragic examples of Jewish cooperation with the Nazis,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement. The Hitler comments appear to have added to the pressure for Israel to abandon its attempts to maintain a neutral stance on the Russian war in Ukraine, a position that has angered its US allies. Since the war broke out, Israel has set up a field hospital in western Ukraine, provided humanitarian supplies, and protective vests and helmets for the Ukrainian army. It has so far refrained from sending more substantial military aid or imposing sanctions on Russia. Israel has a delicate relationship with Russia, as both have military interests in Syria. As the conflict drags on and more evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces against civilians has come to light, Israeli criticism has become more vocal, with Lapid last month accusing Russia of war crimes. In an interview with Ynet published on Monday evening, he said of his counterpart’s allegations: “That angers me not only as foreign minister but also as the son of my father, who was in the ghetto in Budapest. It wasn’t Jews who put him in the ghetto. The Nazis put him there. The Nazis persecuted the Jews and killed 6 million Jews. The Ukrainians aren’t Nazis, only the Nazis were Nazis.” The Israeli daily Haaretz reported on Tuesday that military and political establishments were considering bolstering assistance to Ukraine in the wake of the diplomatic row. The list of items that can be sent to Ukraine will be reviewed in the next few days, the newspaper said. But according to a quoted source in the Haaretz report, Israel will shy away from sending advanced weaponry or defensive technology, such as the missile defence systems President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has asked the Knesset to supply. New shipments of military equipment are likely to be “symbolic”, the source said, in keeping with Israel’s existing policy of avoiding antagonising Moscow. Little has surfaced of what was discussed during Monday’s almost unprecedented summoning of the Russian ambassador, Anatoly Viktorov, for a clarification meeting on Lavrov’s incendiary comments. “The Israeli position was made clear in the meeting and the parties agreed that no further details would be published,” an unnamed official told local media on Tuesday, in what appeared to be an attempt to let the matter lie. Israel’s western allies have been pressuring the country to increase its support for Ukraine since the war broke out in February. Officials are also reportedly worried that Israel’s continued balancing act between Russia and the west could hurt the arms industry by sending the signal that Israel could also sit out future conflicts. Analysts said Lavrov’s inflammatory remarks, which threatened to antagonise one of the few western countries still willing to engage with Russia, were indicative of the “radicalisation” of much of the Russian government and the lack of coherency to its goals in Ukraine. “Diplomacy as a skill, as an art collapsed with everything else on February 24th,” said Alexander Baunov, a Russian political analyst who previously served as a diplomat. There are “no rules, no skills, no rationality … nothing is as usual. They are all disoriented in this new world, including people like Lavrov, Putin himself, they don’t know how to speak, what is allowed and what is not. “They are concentrated on one task which is to justify the thing they have done which is not going as is expected,” he said, referring to the invasion of Ukraine. “And they still have to justify it.”",News/World news,Russia accuses Israel of backing ‘neo-Nazis’ in Kyiv as diplomatic row grows,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/russia-accuses-israel-backing-neo-nazis-kyiv-diplomatic-row-grows
5/4/2022,"A record 28 countries are rated “very bad” places for journalism in the World Press Freedom Index, which warns that autocratic regimes are increasingly willing to crack down on independent media outlets. Billions of people in countries including China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan struggle to access journalism produced without intervention from politicians, with reporters in these places often facing threats to their wellbeing. The annual press freedom list, produced by the campaign group Reporters Without Borders, surveys the state of the media in 180 countries and territories. It blames “globalised and unregulated online information space that encourages fake news and propaganda” for the worsening situation in many countries. One of the biggest fallers on the list is Myanmar, where dozens of journalists have been put in jail since last year’s military coup. Reporters Without Borders said press freedom in the country had been set back by 10 years. The organisation’s campaign chief, Rebecca Vincent, said that although the UK ranked a relatively healthy 24th on the list, concerns remained. Key issues include ongoing threats to journalists in Northern Ireland after the killing of Lyra McKee, the government’s attempts to install a political ally as chair of the media watchdog Ofcom, and the ongoing extradition process involving the WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. She said: “The Assange case is globally important and the UK government is enabling the US government to pursue this case against him. It is also becoming increasingly difficult for journalists of all stripes to access information from this government.” Vincent said weak press freedom left citizens uninformed and less able to hold their governments to account. She warned that authoritarian attitudes towards the media could often spill over into other neighbouring countries, adding: “The war in Ukraine is an extreme example of that – it was a premeditated information war that has turned into a conflict that threatens global security.” Europe is split in two on the rankings, with Nordic countries such Norway, Denmark and Sweden once again topping the list and receiving praise for following a “democratic model where freedom of expression flourishes”. The situation in eastern Europe is much worse, with Poland, Hungary and Albania all scoring relatively badly. The lowest-ranked European country for press freedom is Greece, which slips to 108th in the ranking after the crime journalist Giorgos Karaivaz was gunned down on a street in Athens. The annual ranking has been put together for the last 20 years and is created by assessing direct threats against journalists around the world and combining it with the results of a survey of hundreds of journalists, academics and human rights activists. Among the worst performers is Hong Kong, which has plummeted to 148th after the introduction of a national security law that targets journalists critical of the Chinese government. Russia received one of the lowest rankings after the Kremlin established “complete control of news and information by establishing extensive wartime censorship, blocking the media and pursuing non-compliant journalists, forcing many of them into exile”. 1.

5/4/2022,"Modern pentathlon is to trial a radical new 45-minute format which will be “like James Bond meets the Krypton Factor” as part of plans to transform the event after discarding show jumping in favour of obstacle racing, the Guardian can reveal. The proposal, which would involve minimal breaks between a fencing element followed by swimming, obstacle racing and laser gun events, is designed to tap into the US market and give the sport a far bigger presence on the global stage. Among the ideas also being discussed is showing athletes’ heartbeats as they race, amplifying the noise of the weapons during fencing, and inviting Hollywood to help transform the way the sport is broadcast. Joël Bouzou, the vice-president of the Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne, the sport’s governing body, promised the new format and introduction of obstacle racing would be “exciting and successful.” “With obstacle racing there are moments when you have to jump, hang, and have to choose options – which means you have to think and there is a tactical element,” he added. “We want to integrate all of this and find the complete athlete. When it was suggested to Bouzou it sounded like a cross between James Bond and the Krypton Factor, he replied: “Exactly.” Bouzou also defended the controversial decision to drop show jumping, following a poll by Pentathlon United which found that 95% of athletes were unhappy with the way the UIPM had conducted the change, saying the sport had no other choice if it wanted to stay in the Olympics after Paris 2024. The Frenchman, who won the world title in 1987, said that one problem was that access to horses was very difficult in many parts of Africa and Asia – meaning the sport was not truly global – while the lottery element to pair horses with riders at events was also “unfair”. “We understand that some are unhappy,” he added. “But we have far more people who want to embrace the change. What we are doing is building the future of our sport.” Bouzou said bringing in obstacle racing was part of wider reforms designed to transform the sport – which moved from five days to one day in 1996 – into a fast-moving event for TV. “There are some things that are still to be tested,” he said. “But if we do the whole thing with breaks it could arrive at something close to one hour. And if we make it nearly continuous, we arrive at something like 45 minutes. That’s ideal for a live programme on American TV.” Michael Payne, a former IOC director of marketing who was invited to join the UIPM fifth discipline working group as an external expert, said the sport had no option but to radically reform. “The IOC has introduced pretty rigorous research data, which includes TV audience, social following, global footprint, spectators, and cost,” he said. “And modern pentathlon performs right at the bottom. Unless you transform it, it is no longer contributing to the success, development and strength of the Olympics.” Payne said David Hill, the former head of Fox Sports, had reiterated the point before Monday’s decision. “David, who is possibly the greatest living sports TV producer, told modern pentathlon: ‘At the moment you are at death’s door, but you have potential to become a prime time player if you repackage this’,” he added. Peter Hutton, the former CEO of Eurosport and now head of sports and entertainment at Meta, also stressed that shorter formats were vital for TV. “The advisers in the session were saying: ‘You don’t have to solve everything now,” said Payne. “But the key thing is that you present a vision and picture that the IOC and LA 2028 thinks: ‘hallelujah, they’ve come back with something that is bloody exciting and good.’ And they have.” The British athlete James Cooke, the 2018 world champion, said he backed the reforms but conceded the sport was split. “This is a very emotive subject,” said Cooke, who sits on the UIPM athletes’ commission. “I also have a really close affinity with the sport of riding, but we needed to take a decision to safeguard the future of the sport. “We were facing pressures, not just from the IOC, but over how to develop the sport in nations that don’t have ready access to horses. Hopefully it’s a new era in terms of kicking on and growing in more nations to make it a global sport.”",Sport/Sport,Modern pentathlon to trial ‘James Bond meets Krypton Factor’ 45-minute race,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/03/modern-pentathlon-to-trial-james-bond-meets-the-krypton-factor-event
5/4/2022,"Keir Starmer faced questions during media interviews on Tuesday about an event at which he was photographed holding a beer in April last year, and whether this potentially breached Covid rules at the time. Here is what we know: On 30 April 2021, Starmer was filmed through a window of the office of Mary Foy, the MP for the City of Durham, holding a bottle of beer, with people behind him eating from plates of food. The Labour leader was there as part of campaigning for the byelection in nearby Hartlepool, which was taking place six days later. The images emerged in January this year, during media focus about lockdown-breaking parties in and around Downing Street. While Covid rules necessarily involve some interpretation, the legal and police consensus appears to be not. Political campaigning was permitted ahead of the local elections, which took place on the same day as the byelection, allowing gatherings of party activists. Starmer has said that the images show campaigners breaking for takeaway food, and that with pubs and restaurants shut, this was the only option if they were going to eat. The barrister and Covid rules expert Adam Wagner has said this would be similar to colleagues eating in a work canteen and would thus be viewed as “reasonably necessary for work”. Wagner contrasted it with seemingly prearranged social events at Downing Street for which Boris Johnson and others have been fined. In February, Durham police said there was no case to take any action over Starmer’s behaviour. More recently, the force has said it has received “a number of further communications” on the matter that it will respond to, but that there is no current investigation. Asked on Tuesday whether he had been personally contacted by police, Starmer seemed to dodge the question, but Labour says he has not. Two words: Daily Mail. The paper has run a series of front page headlines about the case, led by Conservative MPs calling for a fresh inquiry into what they insist is the equivalent to the parties inside Downing Street, and proof of Labour hypocrisy. The Mail is highly influential in Conservative circles, and its notably dogged – some have called it obsessive – coverage has prompted more MPs and ministers to comment. This is one of the Mail’s big issues, but it was seemingly a fairly standard press office cock-up. Party sources say it was asked some weeks ago by the Mail if the deputy leader was at the event, and a staff member misunderstood diary records and said she was elsewhere. It was only when the Mail asked again, and officials checked, that they realised the mistake had been made. Rayner’s attendance or absence would seemingly make no difference to the legal position. Some ultra-loyal ministers, notably the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, have demanded Starmer answer more questions about the event. Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international trade secretary, said on Tuesday she would “absolutely encourage” Durham police to look at any new evidence which might emerge. Starmer has said the story is “being whipped up as mud-slinging by the Tories”. It is perhaps early days, but seemingly not much so far. In January, a YouGov poll question about whether Starmer “generally did or did not follow lockdown rules” found 40% believed the Labour party did and 28% did not. The same question asked again on Tuesday found that 28% still did not think so – but that 42% now did. In contrast, 70% of people now think Johnson generally did not follow the rules.",News/Politics,Q&A: key questions facing Keir Starmer over office beer during lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/03/qa-key-questions-facing-keir-starmer-over-office-beer-during-lockdown
5/4/2022,"Seven Caribbean states have condemned as “retrograde” the potential imposition of direct rule from London on the British Virgin Islands (BVI) amid allegations of corruption and the arrest of the former BVI premier last week in a drug-smuggling sting operation. The British Foreign Office minister Amanda Milling was greeted with street protests on Monday as she met BVI politicians and civil society to discuss the possible move to press ahead with direct rule as recommended by a commission of inquiry report last week. The commission, headed by a retired British judge, Sir Gary Hickinbottom, found that corruption and misgovernment was so rife that a partial suspension of the constitution and closure of the national assembly for two years was required. But the proposal has been firmly opposed by BVI politicians, including the acting premier, Natalio Wheatley, who took office after his predecessor Andrew Fahie, 51, was arrested on drug-running charges in Miami last week. On Tuesday, the seven-strong Organisation of East Caribbean States (OECS) issued a firm warning against the move, saying in a statement: “It is ill-advised to impose direct colonial rule and the history of such imposition in the Caribbean has never delivered the desired result. “The OECS concurs with the elected representatives of the people of the BVI that abolition of parliament with direct rule from London represents a retrograde step in the evolution of the democratic process that is inconsistent with the United Nations proclamation of human rights to be free of colonial rule. “The historical responsibility for strengthening governance in the BVI must rest on the shoulders of the elected representatives and the people of the BVI themselves. That ultimately will be the guarantee of good governance and full, transparent accountability. “The UN declaration on granting independence to colonial countries and peoples – resolution 1514 of 1960 – is an international commitment to which Britain is itself bound.” The British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, will have to balance the political turbulence of the former colonial power taking complete charge of the overseas territory against the commission’s clear assessment that the island’s governance has over many years become riddled with corruption. The demonstrations on Monday were a test of whether BVI society believes the arrest of Fahie and the damning findings in the report make it necessary for the UK government to take control while a full review of the BVI constitution is undertaken. The BVI governor, John Rankin, has not yet expressed a view on whether the commission of inquiry recommendations should be implemented, but the commission was established by the governor’s predecessor and it would be striking if its unequivocal chief recommendation was rejected by the British government. Fahie, who is being held in a Miami prison pending a bail hearing, has demanded his immediate release on the basis that as prime minister he can claim diplomatic immunity to arrest and detention. He was arrested on Thursday after he met agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration who were posing as Mexican drug traffickers and allegedly agreeing to take $700,000 in return for waving through a cocaine shipment on its way to the US. Fahie’s lawyers have filed a claim in the Southern District of Florida that diplomatic immunity is conferred on him by virtue of his election as BVI prime minister in February 2019. Christopher Malcolm, a former BVI attorney general, said that the BVI constitution does not describe the BVI as a distinct state. He added: “BVI leaders have no diplomatic status or diplomatic passport. Fahie and his lawyers are clutching at a straw that cannot carry his weight.” If the UK government does impose direct rule, ministers in Whitehall will oversee the introduction of a public register of beneficial ownership of shares on the islands – something the Fahie government has been reluctant to introduce. The BVI is one of the world’s major tax havens and nearly half of the companies named in the recent Pandora Papers investigation were registered in the BVI. The Hickinbottom report reveals the extent to which the BVI government is dependent on financial services for its income. Nearly 55% of the BVI total government budget of £360m in 2020 was provided by fees from financial services. The commission also found that “Since November 2020, the Royal Virgin Islands police force has recovered over 3.6 tons of cocaine, with an estimated street value higher than the annual BVI GDP. It is thought that huge quantities of drugs pass through the BVI undetected. There is also substantial evidence that, despite efforts such as those described briefly above, BVI companies are regularly used in the laundering of colossal amounts of illicit funds”.",News/World news,Caribbean states warn against direct rule of British Virgin Islands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/03/caribbean-states-warn-against-direct-rule-of-british-virgin-islands
5/4/2022,"Current and future cast members of Cinderella must be compensated for their losses after news of the West End show’s sudden closure, the UK trade union for creative practitioners has demanded. It emerged over the bank holiday weekend that the cast of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s new musical learned they were being sacked minutes after a matinee performance. Actors who had been due to join the cast next month found out the news through social media. In a statement released on Sunday by his Really Useful Group, Lord Lloyd-Webber said mounting a new show during the Covid pandemic had been an “unbelievable challenge”, and a new production of Cinderella would open on Broadway in 2023. The final performance of the show at London’s Gillian Lynne theatre is scheduled for 12 June, a year after it opened. Paul Fleming, Equity’s general secretary, said on Tuesday that union members had “poured their hearts and skill into [the show] through the worst two years in living memory” and were now “jobless, effectively sacked by press release”. He added: “All unions are fighting forms of this practice right now, and Equity will get compensation for our members after the pain and distress this has caused them.” The union said compensation should amount to the full value of the current cast members’ contracts until they end on 17 July, and adequate reimbursement for those who were due to start work in June. At a protest outside the Gillian Lynne theatre on Tuesday afternoon, the union also demanded that it be told in advance of intended closures to ensure all cast members were informed before the news was released on social media or in the press. The theatre director, Andrew Keates, wrote on Twitter that he would be joining the protest in solidarity with the cast in “an industry that shouldn’t tolerate discovering their jobs are over via the press and social media”. Among the would-be cast members sharing their disappointment over the weekend was Summer Strallen, who said on Instagram Live that she had been for a wig fitting three days earlier for her role as the Queen. Another, Luke Latchman, tweeted: “Imagine – planning in your head 100 times what you’re going to say when it’s announced. Telling your friends and family you have something coming and can’t wait to tell them about it. Knowing that career-changing West End lead was coming. Then you see a tweet and it’s all gone.” Daisy Twells, who had been due to make her West End debut, said she got the “devastating” news of the closure through a press release. Carrie Hope Fletcher, who plays Cinderella, tweeted: “I don’t think I have the words … Sending love to all impacted by today’s news and by how that news was delivered.” Lloyd Webber, one of the biggest and most successful names in British theatre, has been outspoken about the government’s handling of the pandemic. In stark contrast to his previous hits, including Phantom of the Opera and Cats, which generated billions of pounds, Cinderella suffered heavy losses during its run. The show’s opening was delayed by a year because of the pandemic, and later performances were suspended for two months owing to the Omicron variant. A spokesperson for the Really Useful Group said on Monday that “every effort” had been made to ensure cast members were notified of the closure.",Arts/Stage,Union demands compensation for Cinderella cast after sudden closure,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/03/union-demands-compensation-for-cinderella-cast-after-sudden-closure
5/4/2022,"Police in Canada have intercepted a drone which crossed the border from the United States carrying a shopping bag with nearly a dozen handguns – but only after the pilot crashed the device into a nearby tree. Officers in southern Ontario were called to a home near the town of Port Lambton, north-east of Detroit, after residents reported seeing a stranger maneuvering a commercial drone. “Our neighbour had spotted someone in our yard in the middle of the night and he had a remote control,” Christine Ackwood told CTV News. “He wasn’t sure what was going on.” But the drone operator lost control of the drone and sent it careening into a tree before fleeing in a waiting vehicle. Police recovered the drone with bucket truck, and that a plastic shopping bag was attached with metal carabiners and electrical tape. Inside, officers discovered 11 handguns – most of which were weapons prohibited in Canada. One of the images shared by police appears to show the serial numbers of a black handgun had been sanded off. Officers suspect the drone travelled east from Michigan across the St Clair River, which marks the border between Canada and the United States. But police still do not know who was piloting the drone, and who the illicit delivery was intended for. Many handguns used to commit crimes in Canada are secreted into the country from the United States. In the past, smugglers have used transport trucks, passenger vehicles and aircraft to evade authorities. The use of a drone suggests groups could be trying out new strategies, but it is unclear if Friday’s discovery is the first time a drone has been used.

5/4/2022,"Elon Musk’s $44bn takeover of Twitter is a “chilling development” in billionaires’ desire to increase their political influence by buying up many of the world’s largest and most influential media brands, a leading British analyst has warned. Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, said the super-rich have long sought to buy newspapers to help push their agendas and it was now possible to “count on one hand the big media brands that aren’t owned by an oligarch or other billionaire”. “It’s another sign that the super-wealthy wish to control assets that give them an extra level of power,” she said. “Whatever they may say, that’s the reason why they buy them. “It is now unusual for major news media not to be owned by a billionaire, and that is why the Guardian [owned by the independent Scott Trust], the Financial Times [owned by the employee-owned Japanese media group Nikkei] and the BBC are consistently shown to be the most trusted news brands.” The billionaires who now control vast swathes of the media landscape include: The world’s richest person struck a deal to buy Twitter – journalists’ and politicians’ preferred medium for sharing stories – for $44bn last week, promising to unleash its “extraordinary potential” to boost free speech and democracy across the world. The Amazon founder and second-richest person in the world ($169bn compared with Musk’s $252bn) bought the Washington Post for $250m in 2013. When Bezos took over, the Post was bleeding money and he said the business model was “upside down”. He said of his decision to buy the paper: “I had to do some soul-searching … Is this something I want to get involved in? I started to realise this is an important institution. “It is the newspaper in the capital city of the most important country in the world. The Washington Post has an incredibly important role to play in this democracy. There’s no doubt in my mind about that.” Within three years the paper had doubled its internet traffic and turned a profit. “I know that when I’m 90, it’s going to be one of the things I’m most proud of, that I took on the Washington Post and helped them through a very rough transition,” Bezos said in an interview in 2018. The last standing of the original media barons, Murdoch took over running the News, a small Adelaide newspaper following his father’s death in 1952. He expanded to a portfolio of newspapers across Australia, before entering the UK with the purchase of the News of the World in 1969. In the 1970s he moved to New York, buying up media assets starting with the New York Post. In 2017, Murdoch sold the bulk of his family’s 21st Century Fox entertainment businesses to Walt Disney in a deal worth $66bn, but kept the newspapers and the right-wing US news channel Fox News. “Are we retreating? Absolutely not,” he said at the time. “We are pivoting at a pivotal moment.” Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook while studying psychology at Harvard University in 2004. Within a month, half of the undergraduate population had a profile. Now about 2.9 billion people – more than a third of the world’s population – are signed up. Zuckerberg’s social empire extends beyond Facebook to Instagram (which it bought in 2012) and WhatsApp (taken over in 2014). Late last year, Facebook changed its name to Meta to reflect the Zuckerberg’s ambitions to dominate the “metaverse” – which he says is “the next frontier”. Zuckerberg, the world’s 12th richest person with a $78bn fortune, controls 58% of the voting rights of Meta shares, effectively giving him personal control of all three platforms. The platforms have been accused of influencing the news stories that users are exposed to, and blamed for helping the spread of misinformation, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. The Russian oligarch and former KGB spy Alexander Lebedev is a part-owner of the investigative Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta. In 2009, he bought the Standard for £1, and the following year he bought the Independent for £1. The titles are run by his son, Evgeny, and the family has pumped more than £100m into the businesses. The Standard was a stalwart supporter of then-London mayor Boris Johnson, endorsing his 2012 reelection campaign. In 2015, Johnson and Lebedev camped out together on the streets of London to draw attention to homelessness among army veterans. When Johnson joked that he had fallen in a puddle, Lebedev quipped: “I saved your life.” Evgeny was given a knighthood in 2020. Last week, Downing Street missed the deadline for publishing the security advice it received about granting the peerage, after Johnson denied intervening when intelligence services said it would be a security risk. Evgeny has since sold stakes in the newspapers but remains the largest single shareholder in them. Jonathan Harmsworth, a great-grandson of one of the Mail’s co-founders, this year succeeded in taking the paper’s owner, The Daily Mail and General Trust (DGMT), private after 90 years as a listed company by paying £1.6bn for the 63% of the company he did not already own. Press Gazette estimated that he owns about 39% of the UK national newspapers sold every week in the UK, compared with 29% in 2010. This compares with Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp on 27.5%, down from about 30% a decade earlier. The billionaire twins David and Frederick Barclay bought the Telegraph titles and the Spectator magazine in 2004. The brothers, who lived on the island of Brecqhou in the Channel Islands, previously owned The European, The Scotsman and the Sunday Business. David died last year. Frederick and his daughter, Amanda, had sued a group of David’s relatives over allegations of bugging conversations at the Ritz hotel, which the brothers had previously owned.
