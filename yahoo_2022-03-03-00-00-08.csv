3/3/2022,"The man accused of smearing feces on a woman waiting for a subway cursed out a Bronx judge during his first court appearance Tuesday — ranting that he was tired of waiting. After his arrest for the grotesque Bronx attack, Frank Abrokwa, 37, tried to joke with cops, telling them, “S--- happens, ha ha ha,” and “This is a sh---y situation. Ha ha ha,” prosecutors said. But he was less jovial at his arraignment in Bronx Criminal Court, demanding the judge hurry things up so he could be handed over to a group of Brooklyn detectives waiting to question him in a hate crime investigation. “I’m f---ing tired of it. I’m hungry. Why am I still here? They want to charge me with a hate crime,” Abrokwa said as he was led into court. He’s accused of taking feces out of a plastic bag and shoving it into a 43-year-old woman’s face as she sat on a bench on the Manhattan-bound platform at the Wakefield-241st St. No. 2 train station on Feb. 21. The horrific attack was caught on video. Abrokwa, who was freed without bail in three other cases in Manhattan and the Bronx, was arrested Monday. He wore a baseball cap that read USA, and a shiny silk jacket with a multicolored, psychedelic pattern as he stood before Judge Wanda Licitra late Tuesday. When Licitra issued an order of protection for the victim, Abrokwa piped up, “I don’t know that b---.” “I know where I’m going already. Can I go with the Brooklyn detectives?” he added. When the judge cautioned he should speak with his lawyer, he shot back: “Why are you disrespecting me? Why am I being mistreated by the system?” He then hissed: “I’m talking to my attorney, f--- you, b---.” That’s when Licitra ordered he be returned to his holding cell and brought out later. About an a hour later, a better-behaved Abrokwa returned. Assistant District Attorney Grace Phillips detailed the lead-up to the attack, recounting that Abrokwa hit on the victim, asking her, “Hey, mami, hey, mami, why don’t you talk to me?” and when she ignored him, he walked into an idling subway car and pooped into a bag. He then walked back out and smeared the excrement on her face, head, nose, mouth and eyes, asking the woman, “You like this, b---h?” Phillips said. Even though Abrokwa faces misdemeanors normally not eligible for bail under the state’s recent bail reform laws, the prosecutor tried to convince the judge he should he held on $5,000 cash or $15,000 bond, arguing the attack was part of a pattern of behavior. But Licitra said since she didn’t have video or victim depositions to review in his other recent arrests — two in Manhattan, one in the Bronx — she didn’t have a legally sufficient reason to order him held. Even so, Abrokwa didn’t walk out of court a free man: He was scooped up by the Brooklyn detectives who took him into custody as a suspect in a hate crime. Abrokwa, who’s been arrested 44 times, has one felony conviction and 10 misdemeanor convictions on his record, a Manhattan prosecutor noted while asking for supervised release in a recent non bail-eligible case, law enforcement sources said. Most recently, he’s accused of repeatedly punching a 30-year-old stranger on a subway platform at 125th St. and Lenox Ave. on Jan. 7, and punching a 53-year-old stranger at the Greyhound station at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown on Feb. 5. On Feb. 22, he grabbed screwdrivers and pepper spray from a Bronx hardware store, then pointed a screwdriver at an employee and said, “Call the police,” cops said. Abrokwa was arraigned on bail-ineligible misdemeanor charges in the first two cases, and though police initially charged him with robbery in the Bronx case, he was ultimately arraigned only on menacing, petit larceny and misdemeanor weapon possession charges, court records show.

3/3/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel did not seem overly enthused about President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union address Tuesday night, calling it a “tough speech” and joking that he “probably could’ve just saved himself some time and just tweeted that the State of the Union is ‘malarkey AF.’” “The state of our union is about as strong as Kim and Kanye right now,” the late-night host added, noting that “not every lawmaker showed up to watch the speech, which is not the usual.” “One of those who opted out tonight was Florida Senator Marco Rubio,” Kimmel continued, explaining that the Republican lawmaker skipped the speech because he didn’t want to take the required COVID test. “I don’t have time to go take a COVID test today,” Rubio complained earlier in the day. “I only take a test if I’m sick.” “Which, since you can have and spread COVID without any symptoms, is an incredibly stupid thing to say,” Kimmel said in response. “But, in fairness, that is what Marco Rubio does. He is very on-brand. You know why he won’t do it, right? You know why he won’t take it? Because if they swab his nose, it would probably test positive for Donald Trump’s butt.” Andy Cohen Gives Emotional Rebuke of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for ‘Bullying’ Trans Kids Speaking of the former president, Kimmel expressed disbelief at a poll that found 62 percent of Americans believe Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump were still president. “As far as this fairy tale about him being tough on Putin, remember when our U.S. intelligence informed our president that Russia did everything they could to disrupt our election?” he asked. “And then when given the choice to side with Putin or our own FBI and CIA, guess who he picked?” “There’s your tough guy on Russia,” Kimmel said after playing a clip of Trump’s infamous Helsinki summit press conference. “What happened there is Mr. Tough Guy looked into Putin’s eyes and soaked his Depends.” For more, listen and subscribe to The Last Laugh podcast.
