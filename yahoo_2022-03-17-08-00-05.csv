3/17/2022,"A dog was snatched up by an alligator on the Venice campus of the State College of Florida Manatee-Sarasota, according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. It happened around 7:45 p.m. on Wednesday, March 9, near the Lake Jervey Nature Path. The marshy lake is at the north end of the campus, and is surrounded by trails and parking lots. Witnesses described the dog as a 50-pound pit bull, FWC spokesman Adam Brown told McClatchy News. The owner, who was not identified, did not have the dog on a leash, officials said. No one else was injured in the incident. State wildlife officials determined the alligator posed a threat, and sent a trapper to remove it. Two “nuisance alligators” were ultimately pulled from the lake: One 6 feet, 9 inches long, and the other 7 feet, 10 inches, Brown said. Their fate was not immediately known, but trappers working at the behest of the state can keep the hide and meat of alligators they catch. “Relocating nuisance alligators is not a feasible option for people or alligators. Relocated alligators nearly always try to return to their capture site,” Brown said. “In the process of returning, they can create problems for people or other alligators along the way. If an alligator successfully returns, capturing it again would be necessary and usually more difficult the second time.” Signs posted on the State College of Florida campus warn of alligators and snakes, and tell visitors “not to feed or disturb the alligators.” Florida’s 67 counties are home to an estimated 1.3 million alligators, and “dogs and cats are similar in size to the natural prey of alligators,” the state says. Injuries involving people attacked by alligators are rare, the state says.

3/17/2022,"The Isle of Man deregistered an Airbus helicopter and 17 Russian jets, The Guardian reported. The chopper had previously landed on Roman Abramovich's $600 million superyacht, the report said. The Isle of Man's jurisdiction allows the superrich to avoid some taxes, The Guardian reported. A helicopter linked to a sanctioned Russian oligarch's yacht and 17 private jets with Russian ties had their registration removed by the Isle of Man, a tax haven for the super wealthy, The Guardian first reported. Situated in the Irish Sea between Britain and Ireland, the island has an aircraft registry that includes high-quality private and corporate jets, as well as helicopters, the government website said. The island's registry can allow the wealthy to avoid taxes liable in other countries, The Guardian reported. The Isle of Man is known as a low-tax economy. The Isle of Man's measures bolster the UK's and European Union's ban on all Russian aircraft flying in their airspace as part of sanctions levied following President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. A total of 18 aircraft and two yachts were deregistered as of Wednesday because of their Russian connections, the Isle of Man said in a press release sent to Insider. It also issued notice on 39 ships with ties to Russia, it said. Being deregistered means jets can't legally fly and ships can't legally sail, Alex Allinson, the Isle of Man's minister for enterprise, told the BBC. An Airbus helicopter, which previously landed on Roman Abramovich's $600 million superyacht, Solaris, has been removed from the island's registry, The Guardian reported. A private jet owned by the Russian oligarch Dmitry Mazepin, a Gulfstream G650, was also among the 18 aircraft taken off the registry, the newspaper reported. Oleg Tinkov, the founder of the Russian online bank Tinkoff, who hasn't been sanctioned, also had his Dassault Falcon business jet struck from the island's registry, The Guardian reported. ""The Air and Ship Registries have been acting proactively and rapidly to halt business with Russian connections above and beyond those already sanctioned on the UK's lists,"" Allinson said in statement sent to Insider. The government is looking to remove any aircraft, ships, and yachts that have Russian ties, he added.
