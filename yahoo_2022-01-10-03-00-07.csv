1/10/2022,"Top doctor Dr. Ashish Jha said people who test positive for COVID-19 and are asymptomatic should isolate for five days and then get a negative antigen test. If they are unable to find a test, they should wear a ""high-quality mask,"" he said Sunday. ""The first five days are critical. That's the period when people are the most contagious,"" Jha said. Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and one of the top doctors in the US, said Sunday that people who test positive for COVID-19 and isolate for five days should try to get a negative rapid antigen test before returning to work. If they can't get a rapid test, they should wear a ""high-quality mask"" in case they are still infected, Jha said Sunday during an appearance on ABC News's ""This Week."" ""The first five days are critical. That's the period when people are the most contagious, so if more Americans could stay at home and away from others for the first five days, it would make an enormous difference,"" Jha said. ""You should get a negative antigen — one of those rapid tests. And if it's negative then you should feel much more comfortable going back into society,"" he added. —This Week (@ThisWeekABC) January 9, 2022 The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at the end of December changed its longstanding guidance and said individuals who test positive for COVID-19 but do not show symptoms associated with the disease should isolate for just five days rather than the previously recommended 10 days. According to the CDC, the change was made because science showed that a person was most contagious in the two days before they showed symptoms of COVID-19 and in the 2-3 days after the onset of symptoms. Still, as Insider previously reported, the decision elicited criticism from many, including The American Medical Association, which in a statement called the new guidelines ""confusing"" and ""risking further spread of the virus."" ""This virus has changed and is constantly throwing us curveballs,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday, defending the new guidance, Insider previously reported. ""As this virus changes, the science changes."" Jha said the CDC guidance doesn't require a negative test to end isolation because the agency believed there weren't enough tests to go around. ""How do you recommend something that people can't do?"" he said on Sunday. According to a report Saturday from the Washington Post, the Biden administration is finalizing a plan with the United States Postal Service to send 500 million COVID-19 tests to Americans, who will be able to request them through a website. An announcement of the plan could come this week, and the tests could ship by the middle of January, the Post reported.

1/10/2022,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's gardens could be under threat after a hosepipe ban was imposed in Montecito, where their £11 million mansion boasts nearly eight acres of rolling lawns. It is estimated the couple spend up to £15,000 a month on gardening but a “stop watering” notice issued last month threatens to push up the cost of tending to their sprawling estate, which features immaculately pruned rose gardens, elaborate topiary, fruit trees, tall Italian cypresses, blooming lavender bushes and century-old olive trees. Residents in the exclusive community east of Santa Barbara have been instructed to preserve water as a result of a drought that has sparked fears that the arid, mountainous region will fall victim to wildfires. And this week, residents of California were told they face fines of up to $500 (£370) for wasting water under new rules prohibiting watering the grass within 48 hours of rainfall, filling decorative fountains or washing cars without a shut-off nozzle on the hose. It comes after mid-December saw 80 per cent of the state fall under “extreme” or “exceptional” drought conditions. The new rules will last a year and there are no exceptions for golf courses or other recreational facilities. The Sussexes’s nine-bedroom, 16-bathroom property is particularly prone to drought because historic topography maps and photos show it was built on land with no natural creeks. There is a swimming pool on site, as well as an artificial pond, a babbling brook and small waterfall. A well was installed in 2016 which is thought to help keep the thirsty gardens lush and green. But the use of such private wells, which pull water from the main aquifer as well as the groundwater, have proved controversial in the past. On average, 80 per cent of the water bills on estates in Montecito are used for landscaping, with the largest, estate-style homes said to consume most of the region's water supply. As one local water expert, who did not wish to be named, explained: “There is only a certain amount of available water for the community, no one really knows how much. “Why should the wealthy be able to drain these community water sources at will, from their private wells without oversight, only to sustain lush green lawns and gardens?” Residents who exceed their monthly allowance are penalised and billed in increasingly higher price tiers. In 2014, Harry and Meghan’s friend and neighbour, Oprah Winfrey, the chat show host, was forced to truck thousands of gallons of water to her 40-acre “Promised Land” estate after a drought. That summer, 837 residents coughed up $532,000 (£393,000) in penalties over their water use. For decades, south-west American homeowners have been encouraged to conserve water, forgo green gardens, and instead install rock and cacti gardens indigenous to the region. In December 2020, the Duke likened himself to a raindrop when he launched the Netflix-style streaming platform WaterBear, which is dedicated to conservation documentaries, campaigns and eco-travel films. ""Every single raindrop that falls from the sky relieves the parched ground,” he said. “What if every single one of us was a raindrop, and if every single one of us cared? At the end of the day, nature is our life source… But you can't uplift, educate, and inspire unless there is a form of action that follows. For me, it's putting in the ‘dos’ behind the ‘says’. There's a lot of people that say, but this is about action.""",U.S./The Telegraph,Grass may no longer be greener for Harry and Meghan as California hit with hosepipe ban,https://news.yahoo.com/grass-may-no-longer-greener-155727196.html

President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev issued shoot-to-kill orders to end unrest he has blamed on what he terms 'bandits' and 'terrorists'. At Tokayev's invitation, the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) sent troops to restore order, an intervention that comes at a time of high tension in Russia-U.S. relations ahead of new talks on the Ukraine crisis. ""A number of strategic facilities have been transferred under the protection of the united peacekeeping contingent of the CSTO member states,"" the presidential office said in a statement on Sunday (January 9) detailing a security briefing chaired by Tokayev.
