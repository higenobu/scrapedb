As of Sunday, they have also proven their ability to challenge children to lethal dares. Alexa, Amazon’s virtual assistant, recently advised a 10-year-old girl to touch a penny to a live plug socket after she asked the Echo smart speaker for a challenge.  “My 10 year old just asked Alexa on our Echo for a challenge and this is what she said,” said user Kristin Livdahl in a tweet on Sunday. She accompanied the caption with a screenshot of Alexa’s response. “Here’s something I found on the web. According to ourcommunitynow.com: The challenge is simple: plug in a phone charger about halfway into a wall outlet, then touch a penny to the exposed prongs,” read Alexa’s response.

Users were quick to express their shock and dismay at the tweet, which has since garnered 17,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets. One user tweeted, “Omg that’s horrible.” Others poked fun at the incident, with one saying, “Clearly AMZN’s algorithm realize that by suggesting this challenge customers will later have to buy a lot of stuff to replace everything after the house burned down.” Another user said, “What did you expect when you outsourced parenting to an AI.” Amazon said they have since resolved the issue, with a spokesperson telling CNN, “Customer trust is at the center of everything we do and Alexa is designed to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful information to customers.” “As soon as we became aware of this error, we quickly fixed it, and will continue to advance our systems to help prevent similar responses in the future.”",News/Technology,Amazon’s Alexa device tells 10-year-old to touch a penny to a live plug socket,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/dec/29/amazons-alexa-child-penny-live-plug
12/30/2021,"Pep Guardiola refused to write off the title credentials of Chelsea and Liverpool, despite his Manchester City team extending their commanding lead at the top of the Premier League. City’s 1-0 win at Brentford, courtesy of an early Phil Foden winner, took full advantage of Liverpool’s loss at Leicester on Tuesday and Brighton snatching a late point at Chelsea in Wednesday’slast night’s earlier match.  “There are many games to go,” said Guardiola, whose City team appear on course for a fourth title in five seasons. “We are eight points in front but there are 54 still to play for and many tough games still to play. “I’m not going to believe anyone who says it’s already done. The teams we have with Chelsea and Liverpool are more than exceptional. One is a European champion and Liverpool have been our big rival in the last three or four years.” Foden’s winner in a tight match at the Community Stadium made it 10 successive Premier League wins, a pace City’s chasers have struggled to cope with. “We have the distance not because they dropped points but because we won 10 in a row. But there are 54 points still to play for,” Guardiola said. The restoration of Foden and Jack Grealish to the starting lineup after some pre-Christmas hijinks were punished had the desired effect, at least for Foden. Playing as a false nine he had the ball in the net again in the second half, only to fall foul of VAR. “Phil has always been outstanding,” said Guardiola. “He’s a guy who can play in different positions at an exceptional level. We had no doubts about that. Did he have anything to prove? Absolutely not.” This season at Brentford, Arsenal have lost, Liverpool could only draw 3-3 and Chelsea been given a scare by Thomas Frank’s battling team, and Guardiola was relieved to escape with three points ahead of Saturday’s visit to fourth-placed Arsenal. “Just look at the results Brentford have done this season. It has been so tight. They are exceptional at what they do and that’s why the game we played was perfect today,” added Guardiola. City, who play Arsenal next, have another quick turnaround after two games in three days over the Christmas period. “We come back to Manchester tonight, arrive late, recover as much as possible because at 12.30 on 1 January we have another game,” Guardiola said.",Sport/Football,"Liverpool and Chelsea are still title contenders, says Pep Guardiola",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/30/liverpool-and-chelsea-are-still-title-contenders-says-pep-guardiola
12/30/2021,"British workers facing soaring costs of living in 2022 need a bigger pay rise after a “lost decade” of wage growth under Conservative-led governments, the head of the Trades Union Congress has said. In her new year’s message, Frances O’Grady urged ministers to take immediate steps to encourage faster pay growth across the British economy amid soaring energy bills and other costs.  Issuing a challenge to Boris Johnson, she said his government could not “sit this wages crisis out” after cutting benefits and announcing plans for a tax raid on workers next year. “After decades of real wage cuts and falling living standards, no one can seriously say working people don’t deserve a pay rise,” she said. “That’s my priority, and the priority of the whole union movement, in 2022. The prime minister should shape up and make it his priority too.” O’Grady’s message comes as pressure mounts on the government over living costs and the highest inflation rate in a decade, amid warnings that the Tories’ tax and spending plans will further damage living standards. The Resolution Foundation said on Wednesday that 2022 was set to be “the year of the squeeze” as households faced a £1,200 hit to their incomes from stalling wages, higher tax, and rising energy bills. Highlighting the financial stress on working families, O’Grady said successive Tory-led governments had failed to get wages rising for the past 11 years. “We are still in the longest period of pay stagnation since the Napoleonic wars. Real wages for millions are less than they were before the bankers’ crisis in 2008,” she said. Analysis by the TUC showed that workers would be £500 a year better off if real wages grew at pre-financial crisis rates between now and 2026. However, it warned inflation-adjusted pay was on track to rise by just £150 a year instead. It found that if real pay growth seen before the 2008 crash had been maintained, workers would have been about £8,000 better off today in real terms. O’Grady said ministers needed to work with unions to develop a “long-term economic plan”, including the use of fair pay agreements, whereby the government brings together worker and employer representatives to set minimum pay, terms and conditions for particular sectors. “Fair pay agreements work all over the world. And they could work here too. They are a sensible, modern solution to the problems of staff shortages, low skills, and low pay. And they will stop a race to the bottom on pay and conditions,” she said. O’Grady said other measures were also required, including an immediate increase in the national living wage to £10 an hour, a ban on zero-hours contracts, outlawing fire and rehire tactics, and ending outsourcing. The current national living wage of £8.91 an hour will increase to £9.50 from April. She added: “If I have one message for this government at the start of 2022, it is this: Britain needs a pay rise.”",Lifestyle/Money,"Tackle pay stagnation to help Britons with soaring living costs, urges TUC",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/30/tackle-pay-stagnation-to-help-britons-with-soaring-living-costs-urges-tuc
12/30/2021,"No 10 hired US lawyers to advise on the legal position of the US president, Bill Clinton, at the time of the Monica Lewinsky scandal before Tony Blair’s official 1998 visit to Washington, previously secret documents reveal. The British prime minister’s visit was overshadowed by Clinton’s relationship with the White House intern, with the UK’s US ambassador, Sir Christopher Meyer, describing Lewinsky in one cable as “the phantom at the feast”.  As Downing Street put finishing touches to Blair’s programme, Clinton had famously denied “sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky” while the Drudge Report published allegations she had kept a stained dress. The developments led No 10 to quietly drop plans for Cherie Blair to attend a Washington meeting on the White House intern scheme during the visit. Philip Barton, Blair’s private secretary, wrote to Cherie’s adviser, Fiona Millar: “I have been reflecting on the impact of the latest allegations about a White House intern. Do you think it would be prudent to drop this part of the programme for now, in case the press gets wind of it?” A later memo, from Barton to the Washington embassy, noted: “For obvious reasons, we do not want a meeting on interns to appear in the programme.” Blair flew to Washington in February 1998 at the height of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr’s wide-ranging investigation into the conduct of Clinton and his wife, Hillary. Starr had originally been appointed to look into the Clintons’ financial dealings but his inquiry had been expanded to cover allegations of sexual harassment made by Paula Jones, an Arkansas state government employee, and claims the president had an affair with Lewinsky. A background briefing fax from John McInespie, a lawyer at the Washington law firm Sutherland, Asbill & Brennan LLP, on Clinton’s legal position. It said: “So far our people say that there is no ‘smoking gun’ to charge Clinton with anything, but that might not be the case by the time of the forthcoming visit of the prime minister.” It added if Lewinsky stuck to her original affidavit, denying she and Clinton had sexual relations, then “all she has to do is face the embarrassment of being branded a “bullshitter – (a term of art)”, but if her lawyer got her full immunity, “this strategy is highly dangerous to President Clinton”. The White House was grateful when Blair, at a joint White House press conference, publicly praised Clinton as “someone I am proud to call not just a colleague, but a friend”. Meyer noted in a feedback cable: “The tension shown by Clinton and his staff before the press conference was matched only by their relief afterwards. Clinton was at his Houdini best.” Meyer added that Jim Steinberg, the deputy national security adviser, told him: “Your prime minister didn’t have to say what he did at the press conference. We owe you big time.” Meyer added: “The task will be to call in the debt at the right time.” In another memo from Meyer to the Foreign Office, he said he had visited George W Bush in Texas, then considering running for president. “Bush admitted that, apart from Mexico, he did not know much about international affairs and that he would do well to broaden his experience,” Meyer wrote. Bush would go on to serve two terms as president between 2001 and 2009. Bush remarked Blair “seemed like a good fellow”, Meyer added. “As the only other Labour politician he appeared to have heard of was Michael Foot, I offered a rapid potted history of how Labour had moved on since then.”",News/Politics,No 10 hired US lawyers to advise on Lewinsky scandal before Blair visit to US,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/30/no-10-hired-us-lawyers-to-advise-on-lewinsky-scandal-before-blair-visit-to-us
12/30/2021,"Six new dinosaurs, an Indian beetle named after Larry the cat, and dozens of crustaceans critical to the planet’s carbon cycle were among 552 new species identified by scientists at the Natural History Museum this year. In 2021, researchers described previously unknown species across the tree of life, from a pair of giant carnivorous dinosaurs known as spinosaurs – nicknamed the “riverbank hunter” and “hell heron” – to five new snakes that include the Joseph’s racer, which was identified with the help of a 185-year-old painting.  With international travel to field sites restricted, scientists at the London-based museum concentrated on describing existing collections and species that roamed the Earth millions of years ago. “It has been a fantastic year for the description of new dinosaurs, especially from the UK,” said Dr Susannah Maidment, a senior researcher in paleobiology at the museum, who helped describe some of the new finds. “Although we’ve known about the UK’s dinosaur heritage for over 150 years, the application of new techniques and new data from around the world is helping us to uncover a hidden diversity of British dinosaurs.” Spinosaurs were among four UK dinosaur species described by researchers alongside a new iguanodontian with an unusual snout from the Isle of Wight, and Pendraig milnerae, the earliest known carnivorous dinosaur from the UK. More than half of the new species identified at the museum this year were copepods, small shrimp-like creatures found in salt and fresh water. They form a large part of zooplankton on which krill, fish and other invertebrates feed, playing a vital role in the planet’s ecology and carbon cycle. Because of their abundance, copepods are among some of the biggest carbon sinks in the oceans. Scientists described 291 species this year, many from a collection created over six decades by French researchers Claude and Françoise Monniot. “Copepods are not only free-living but many are parasites, and they can be found living in virtually every other major animal group,” said Prof Geoff Boxshall, a researcher in the museum’s department of life sciences who identified the crustaceans with a South Korean colleague, Il-Hoi Kim. “The huge Monniot collection was made available to Il-Hoi Kim and myself, and as we are both recently retired, we theoretically had time to finally go through it. However, the collection was so enormous it was somewhat daunting – but then Covid-19 happened and completing the series of papers became my lockdown project.” Other newly identified species included 52 wasps, 13 moths, seven crabs, six flies and five amphipods. Beetles featured heavily, as they did in 2020, with 90 new species described. They included a pair of purple and green metallic beetles from India, a monochromatic beetle with a large pair of jaws from the Philippines, and a marsh-loving beetle named in honour of Larry the cat, the Downing Street mouser. A new bush-cricket from south-east Asia, known for its song before the animal had ever been seen, was finally determined to be a species found in Singapore – now known as Mecopoda simonodoi – a specimen of which has actually been sitting in the museum since 1984. Five new species of plants from eastern Africa were identified: known as jewelweeds or touch-me-nots, they usually produce delicate pink or white flowers, except for a few species which have switched to red flowers to attract birds rather than butterflies for pollination. As well as the plants, eight new species of algae, six parasitic worms and three diatoms – single-celled algae – were identified.

12/30/2021,"Hospitals have been asked to identify sites for up to 4,000 emergency beds to deal with a potential wave of Omicron admissions in England, as cases hit a record 183,000. On Wednesday, more than 10,000 patients were in hospital with Covid, a figure not reached since March.  NHS England confirmed that it was creating new small-scale “Nightingale” facilities with up to 100 beds each at eight hospitals across the country. The health service said it had asked trusts to identify empty spaces to accommodate beds in places such as gyms or teaching areas. NHS managers are aiming to create up to 4,000 beds as surge capacity if needed, with work on the first tranche, in temporary structures, starting this week. A number of huge temporary hospitals, called the “Nightingales”, were built in exhibition halls in the first wave of the pandemic but were dismantled without being used to capacity. The new approach will ask for surge capacity to be built in the grounds of hospitals to make it easier for staff to move between new and old sites and keep patients closer to diagnostics and emergency care. The first sites will be at Preston, Leeds, Birmingham, Leicester, Stevenage, St George’s in London, Ashford and Bristol. There are currently almost 90,000 adult acute and general beds available in England, with occupancy at about 90% on 19 December. The announcement came as new data showed there were 10,462 people in hospital in England with Covid as of Wednesday, although it is still unclear how many were admitted with the disease and how many are there for another reason while also testing positive. The number of patients on mechanical ventilation has remained fairly stable in recent weeks and even reduced since November. On Wednesday the number of deaths reported was 57. Boris Johnson returned from his Christmas break at Chequers on Wednesday with a visit to a vaccine centre to urge people to get their booster jabs, saying up to 90% of people in intensive care had not received their third dose. He said people should celebrate New Year’s Eve but called on them to exercise caution and take tests. The prime minister also warned that Omicron continued to “cause real problems” even though it was “obviously milder than the Delta variant”. The NHS has called on people to have a “jabby new year”, highlighting research from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) that found that at the start of last month about three out of five patients in London’s intensive care units had not received a jab, a figure that it said was rising. Prof Stephen Powis, the NHS national medical director, said the health service hoped never to have to use the surge beds but added: “Given the high level of Covid-19 infections and increasing hospital admissions, the NHS is now on a war footing.” Sajid Javid, the health secretary, also said it was “absolutely right that we prepare for all scenarios and increase capacity”. With the government still concerned about the possibility that the high case numbers of Omicron could overwhelm the NHS, Johnson is holding off from cutting the Covid isolation period to five days for those without symptoms. The prime minister has come under pressure to reduce the UK’s isolation period again, after the US decided to halve it for those without symptoms from five to 10 days as long as they wear a mask in public. The UK reduced its quarantine period from 10 to seven days last week if people test negative by lateral flow, but some other countries around the world are now looking at going further. Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University and the government’s life sciences adviser, has indicated support for a shorter isolation period “if it was supported by lateral flow data”. A No 10 source said everything was “kept under review” but insisted that there were “no immediate plans” to revise the quarantine period again so soon. Several Tory backbenchers called on the government to consider a move similar to the US. Andrew Bridgen urged Johnson to reduce the isolation period, saying the biggest threat to the NHS was “forced absentees due to self-isolation”. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said a five-day isolation period followed by a lateral flow test “sounded sensible” for Omicron cases. “If the Americans are doing it, the question is why are we not doing it, not why we should,” he said. Davis also called on the government to make sure it has enough doses of therapies such as Paxlovid that can reduce the risk of hospitalisation in severe Covid cases and to improve data on how many people are in hospital because of the coronavirus, rather than for another condition while also testing positive for the virus. Lee Anderson, a 2019 intake Tory backbencher, said “all options to get people back to work quicker should be looked at”. Another MP added said “isolation could be a bigger issue than actual illness” and they would “support a review at the very least”. Chloe Smith, the minister for disabled people, health and work, said on Wednesday there were “no current plans in England to change the period” for isolation. She told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday: “Of course, we have actually only recently taken it down from 10 to seven, and we want to look at that – we want to make sure that that is working as we believe it ought to. We think the current period, therefore, is the right one, so we haven’t any plans to change that further.” NHS managers have said they are as worried about the impact on patient care of staff shortages from people having to isolate as they are about surging admissions from Covid. The chief executive of NHS Providers, Chris Hopson,said the effect of greater social mixing over Christmas was still to come. He told BBC Breakfast: “We’re now seeing a significant increase in the level of staff absences, and quite a few of our chief executives are saying that they think that that’s probably going to be a bigger problem and a bigger challenge for them than necessarily the number of people coming in who need treatment because of Covid.” In response to the new Nightingale sites, Hopson said it “must be the right ‘no regrets later’ move to make these preparations now” but highlighted the difficulty of staffing them. “Given the other pressures on the NHS and the current level of staff absences, staffing this capacity would be a major challenge,” he said. “But co-location on existing hospital sites maximises the NHS’s ability to meet that challenge.”",News/Society,"Hospitals in England asked to look for up to 4,000 emergency Covid beds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/30/covid-hospitals-england-asked-look-4000-emergency-beds
12/30/2021,"Downing Street initially opposed allowing the landmark Stephen Lawrence inquiry to examine police relations with minority ethnic communities, arguing that to do so would only raise unrealistic hopes for real change. The Macpherson inquiry eventually concluded that the Metropolitan police was institutionally racist, providing a watershed moment in race relations in the UK. But newly released Cabinet papers show Tony Blair wanted to treat the racist murder as an individual incident and to search for lessons to be learned for future investigations of racist killings.  The papers show No 10 believed the then home secretary, Jack Straw, should focus on what they saw as “achievable and appropriate” goals in order to ensure the support of the police. “I had originally contemplated a review to consider whether the events subsequent to the murder held any general lessons for the investigation and prosecution of serious racially motivated crimes,” Straw wrote to Blair on 8 June 1997. “Since then, however, the solicitors for the Lawrence family have made a formal complaint to the commissioner of the Metropolitan police about the way in which the case was handled. An investigation supervised by the Police Complaints Authority has begun, and this makes it inadvisable for another inquiry into the case to run simultaneously. “That said, however, there is clear disquiet, not least within the black community, about the issues raised by this case. I believe that the best way to address these, and draw something positive from this tragic case, would be to launch a broader inquiry into police relationships with ethnic minority communities generally.” In the note, Straw appeared to try to head off claims the inquiry would constitute an attack on the police, telling Blair: “I am concerned that this should not be perceived as undermining the police but as an opportunity to identify and promote good practice.” A handwritten note in the margin, apparently for the attention of Blair’s policy adviser Liz Lloyd read: “Is this sensible?” The response, signed “Liz” and dated 11 June, read: “No.” In a typed-up note to Blair’s chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, sent the same day, Lloyd wrote: “I do not think that another wide-ranging review is the best way forward. It will raise expectations that we will not be able to achieve on one hand, and even with good presentation look like an attack on the police on the other. “I much prefer JS’s original proposal, which was to consider ‘whether the events subsequent to the [Lawrence] murder held any general lessons for the investigation and prosecution of serious racially motivated crime’. “I would therefore suggest that JS focuses his review on changes which are achievable and appropriate. It is vital that the police are signed up to the principle of the review, even if they are not in the lead.” The Macpherson report, launched by Straw about a month later, found institutional racism within Scotland Yard and called for widespread changes in the way public bodies across many different fields interact with communities of colour. Its authors said the debate about policing and racism had been transformed by the inquiry, “and that the debate thus ignited must be carried forward”. Downing Street’s pessimistic view of the inquiry’s prospects was detailed in Cabinet Office papers released to the National Archives under the 20-year rule. The files also show that Blair blocked proposals for an ambitious race equality strategy proposed by Straw as Macpherson prepared to publish his report. Straw wanted to publish a government white paper with a 10-year strategy for tackling racial inequality. He set out his proposals in a letter to the prime minister in December 1998 – before the inquiry’s expected report early the following year. He said he wanted to announce a white paper setting a commitment by all government departments to put race equality at the heart of policymaking. “At the extreme, black and Asian youngsters have observed their grandparents and parents suffer discrimination, harassment and racial violence and are developing very hardened attitudes against the white community. We have to win back their confidence in the institutions of British society,” he warned. But Blair was sceptical from the outset, expressing concern that it could result in a “regulation nightmare”. And Angus Lapsley, an official in the prime minister’s private office, said they were “cool” towards a suggestion that racist police officers should usually be dismissed, fearing the reaction of rightwing newspapers. “This could easily become a ‘Telegraph’ cause celebre if taken too far,” he noted. Blair indicated that he agreed and wrote: “We do not want to go OTT on this.” The proposal was finally killed off at a meeting between Blair and Straw on 18 March 1999. A spokesman for the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change said: “The government took a whole raft of actions, including on recruitment, and in fact implemented the Macpherson report.”",News/UK news,Downing Street initially opposed Stephen Lawrence inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/30/downing-street-initially-opposed-stephen-lawrence-inquiry
12/30/2021,"The “race for space” between homebuyers has pushed up prices in some UK towns by about a fifth this year, with Taunton topping a list of areas with the biggest increases. The average price paid for a property in the Somerset town increased by £56,546 (21.8%) to £315,759 in the 12 months to October, according to figures from the mortgage lender Halifax.  It said that while across the UK prices had risen by an average of 6.2%, in a handful of towns growth had been treble that, fuelled in part by buyers reassessing their priorities as a result of the pandemic. The lender includes London boroughs in its analysis of towns, and said none appeared in its table of the top 20 increases. In three – Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham, and Islington – prices had fallen. There were also drops in Airdrie and Coatbridge in Scotland. The UK housing market has boomed since the first lockdown was eased, and this year it is expected to be the busiest since 2007. For many months, estate agents reported high demand for large homes outside cities, as buyers who were working from home sought more space and placed less importance on living close to the office. Stamp duty holidays across the UK also fuelled sales at the higher end of the market, where buyers could make the maximum tax saving. In England, the tax break on the first £500,000 of a property’s cost allowed buyers to save up to £15,000. Russell Galley, the managing director of Halifax, said: “As the county town of Somerset, this year’s house price winner, Taunton, has a lot to offer homebuyers with its high quality of life and great transport links to major towns and cities across the south-west. “Like Taunton, many of the areas that saw the biggest house price growth over the last year enjoy a combination of greater affordability and space compared to nearby cities.” Second to Taunton was Newark in the east Midlands, where average prices rose by 20% to £280,934, followed by Rochdale in Greater Manchester, where they increased by 18.5% to £206,098. Many of the towns that recorded big price increases were in the north of England, where prices were typically lower than the national average. Separate research by Yorkshire building society, which analysed Land Registry figures, showed a similar picture, with eight of the top 10 highest price rises recorded in local authority areas in the north of England or Scotland. Its strategic economist, Nitesh Patel, said the “extraordinary price growth” in many parts of the country had been driven by low borrowing costs, the return of low-deposit mortgages and falling unemployment, as well as stamp duty savings. However, he added, two impacts of the pandemic may be even stronger drivers. “Due to the restrictions and less travelling, many households saved more than they normally would have, estimated at around £170bn of ‘excess’ savings,” he said. “The second factor is the pandemic has encouraged a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to revaluate housing needs. Buyers are seeking out more space to work from home as well as more outdoor space.” Halifax’s figures showed that for Greater London as a whole, the average price of a home fell by 0.6% to £554,684. However, this disguised a mixed picture across the boroughs. The London borough with the biggest increase in prices was Enfield, where the average cost of a home went up by 6.8% to £512,135. Westminster in central London recorded the biggest fall in the UK, with the average price dropping by 6.9% to £738,088. “It is rare that no London boroughs appear amongst the areas of highest house price growth, but that is the case in 2021,” said Galley. “This shift echoes what we have seen from homebuyers over the last year – less focus on major cities and more demand in the suburbs and further afield.”",Lifestyle/Money,House prices shoot up in UK towns as ‘race for space’ continues apace,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/30/house-prices-shoot-up-in-uk-towns-as-race-for-space-continues-apace
