3/12/2022,"Another step negotiated by New France, as they progress to their own World Cup next year – and, before that, a date with their bitterest enemy, everyone’s bitterest enemy in rugby’s small world, England in Paris next weekend. Another successful step there, and a grand slam will be theirs, a first since 2010, a first title since 2010, a dozen years, long and barren. That said, this notion that France are in a different class to les autres suffered a few cracks. Wales, after a torrid start, the like of which France are increasingly adept at inflicting, were comfortably the equal of their vaunted visitors. They are beginning to reassemble a more familiar pack, Taulupe Faletau a second game into his return and looking all the more magnificent for it, but their front five, in particular, remains raw. Well, they stood up handsomely against the monstrous French pack. With only small adjustments to the dread reality of What Actually Happened, Wales might have won – and no one could possibly have argued with it. But the hated Friday night slot, the cauldron of Cardiff – albeit shorn of nearly a fifth of its usual number – there were more than enough ingredients to render this latest step exactly the kind any temperamental France side might have slipped on in the past. That France, ultimately, did not is to their credit, as of course is the little burst of panache that proved the difference. Against Ireland, against Scotland and now against Wales, France have distinguished themselves by simply outplaying their opponents in that special period of the game when the lungs are full, the passions high, the excuses low – those first 10 minutes. The game’s only try was scored in the ninth minute, and a beauty it was. In it lay the reasons for this France team’s lionisation. Melvyn Jaminet is almost as much the embodiment of this generation as his more celebrated teammates at half-back. The full-back is worth his place for his goal-kicking alone, but his elegance in attack is very French, as are the lingering question marks over his authority when the game is not quite going France’s way. Both were in evidence here, but the elegance won out because of those golden minutes in France’s opening. Jaminet it was who ran back a loose Welsh kick, finding a gap and releasing Gabin Villiere on the left. The ball went right, but when the sweetest of handling sequences brought it back left again, Jaminet beat another outside shoulder to send Anthony Jelonch striding over. Should we be impressed the try was all France would need in the end, with only another penalty, the only score of the second half, the extent of their proceeds from the subsequent 70 minutes? Or should England, for example, be encouraged that there remains ample scope to ruffle them? Certainly, if Jaminet, Antoine Dupont, Romain Ntamack and the like are the bellwethers of the side, unplayable when on form, there is reason to think questions might still be asked of their authority. Not even Dan Biggar’s mum would claim that he is more talented than his opposite number, Ntmack, but when it comes to the imposition of personality on a contest, few are more forceful. If Wales felt they had done more than enough to win, it is because we came away more aware of the role played by Biggar, Faletau, Liam Williams et al than that played by their opponents beyond those opening minutes. What does that matter? Wales did not win. They had their moments in the second half, one golden opportunity to score a try about as consummate as that scored by France spilled agonisingly by another returning veteran, Jonathan Davies. Biggar’s cross-kick was classy, Faletau’s catch of it on the run and inside ball to die for, but Davies could not hold the pass. A try then and the questions over this young French team would have become louder. But there was no try then. Nor again when Wales were held up after yet another siege of the French line. Does that mean the questions are invalid? Or does it mean they are just yet to be asked? Roll on, next weekend in Paris....

3/12/2022,"Frank Lampard defended Everton’s players against accusations that they do not care but described their 5-0 thrashing at Tottenham as an eye-opener that must jolt them into life in their relegation battle. Everton’s seventh loss in eight league games was the heaviest defeat of Lampard’s managerial career and brought fierce criticism of an underachieving team who could drop into the bottom three on Saturday before they face Wolves on Sunday. Lampard hopes to address the culture of negativity among the supporters, saying he “smelled it”, but accepted that his team have to prove their commitment on the pitch after an abject display on Monday. “It was a bit eye-opening for me,” he said. “That performance should be a jolt for everybody. I understand that if you are a fan of a club or work around a club and have seen it before then it is something that very easily can become really negative really quickly. And we can’t be negative. That’s my job now: to build players up and get them positive. Not be a cheerleader because there has to be some reality. “I don’t want to build up players for no reason. But what I do see – and I’m generalising – is a group of lads who do care. There is no doubt about that. We’re 17th for a reason: before I got here. So we need to understand that I am not painting a pretty picture of a load of lads who care and it’s all going to be fine, I’m painting a picture that I know that they care but, proactively, what are they going to do about it?” Lampard realises that changing the team’s reputation and bringing greater patience among fans is a long-term task, but in the short term he is encouraging his players to avoid the damning verdicts on social media unless they can cope with them. “To change that idea and culture is certainly something I want to do,” he said. “It’s not an easy process. It doesn’t come just from saying it and flicking a switch. Fortunately, I do not go on social media but the players do. If they are, they are going to have to deal with it and that is not easy. I remember I used to read the marks out of 10 in the newspapers 20 years ago when I was playing for England and I got five, and it was not nice at all. Now it is on a different level to that.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard backs Everton players after fierce criticism of defeat by Spurs,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/frank-lampard-backs-everton-players-after-fierce-criticism-of-defeat-by-spurs
3/12/2022,"Antonio Conte has suggested he would be open to extending his contract at Tottenham if the club can show “good vision” and make “big, big improvements”. The manager sparked fears he could be ready to quit after the 1-0 defeat at Burnley on 23 February, saying he could not go on like this and questioning whether he was the person to improve the situation. Conte is nothing if not emotional and, reflecting on the period since the winter break at the end of January – one defined by soaring highs and crushing lows – he said that the team had got better. The January transfer window, when the club added the midfielders Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski, was a step in the right direction and Conte is determined to build on it with further additions in the summer. Before then, he also wants to develop his working relationship with the club. Conte joined last November on a contract until June 2023. There is the option to extend and he was asked whether he may do so as it would show his commitment to everybody, including prospective signings. “In this moment there is only one truth and [it is] I am committed with this club for another year,” Conte said. “The club wanted this situation and I accepted because it was good to know each other [first]. After four and a half months, the club understood my way to work and I understood the club. We now have three months to the end of the season to continue to improve this knowledge of each other and then to find the best solution for both. “I am enjoying to work for this club. My ambition is to fight to be competitive, to fight to win. I know my soul, my heart and my mind wants this. I hope that we can match these two situations. “It will be very important to have a good vision. In January, we showed that we have just started to improve the situation. To fight to win the league or to stay in the top four, we need a big, big improvement and we have started to do this with these players. We are improving a lot. But you need in the future to have other important steps. And to have the ambition with facts and not only with words.” Spurs are seventh, three points behind fourth-placed Arsenal having played one game more, and they face Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Conte continues to rate United as being among the division’s top four teams, alongside Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea, who occupy the first three places. He said that Spurs had to hope one of them, presumably United, finished outside the top four but he has become more comfortable in talking up his club’s Champions League aspirations. “I have improved our level of ambition as now I am asking my players to fight for this target,” Conte said. “I want to put the pressure on myself and the whole environment because the players deserve this type of pressure. It has to be a good pressure. “We are ready. We are ready to fight, to play our cards and see what happens. It would be outstanding for us to win a Champions League [place] because, don’t forget, this season for Tottenham was very difficult for many, many aspects.”",Sport/Football,Conte willing to consider extending Tottenham contract if club show ‘vision’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/antonio-conte-willing-to-consider-extending-tottenham-contract-if-club-show-vision
3/12/2022,"Ralf Rangnick denied Marcus Rashford has not had enough game-time under him, with Manchester United’s interim manager stating the forward is free to consider leaving in the summer if he wishes. The 24-year-old is thinking about whether to depart because he is unhappy at his number of minutes since Rangnick took over in November. Rashford did not start Sunday’s 4-1 loss at Manchester City, which was the fourth consecutive league match he has been a substitute, though he was in the XI that drew at Atlético Madrid a fortnight ago. In all Rashford has made 10 starts and been a replacement four times under the German. With Rashford having scored only five goals in 24 appearances this season, Rangnick was asked whether, as his recent lack of minutes is due to his poor form, it should be incumbent on the 24-year-old to show the manager what he can do. “I don’t think that he’s not had enough game time,” said the 63-year-old. “He’s had 13-14 games since I’ve been here now, he played more games from the start than he didn’t play from the start. “I don’t think this is an issue and he never said anything about that since we spoke yesterday [Thursday]. But the [transfer] window is closed now. Even suppose he and his agents or his family at one stage of the summer think about maybe going to another club, well then he can do that but in the summer. Now the window is closed. It’s got nothing to do with tomorrow’s game [v Tottenham] or the game on Tuesday [Atletico Madrid]. “I spoke with him yesterday and the day before so I don’t know anything about him being unhappy. He didn’t say anything to me, he said to me that he is still happy and that he wants to perform on a high level for the club. There was no mention of him not being happy here.” Cristiano Ronaldo has recovered from injury, the striker having flown to Portugal last weekend as he was not available for the City match. Rangnick was not aware the 37-year-old had done so. “I didn’t know anything about that trip,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense now to waste energy and deal with it because the games we have to play now are too important. I decided to put my focus on the upcoming games and not waste any energy with things that happened in the last six or seven days.” Asked if Ronaldo is happy at United, Rangnick said: “I haven’t asked him if he’s happy at Manchester, at this club, he’s fit again, resumed training yesterday and we shall see which formation we will line up with tomorrow.” Edinson Cavani is also fit again following injury.",Sport/Football,Rangnick says Rashford free to leave United if game-time is a problem,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/rangnick-says-rashford-free-to-leave-united-if-game-time-is-a-problem
