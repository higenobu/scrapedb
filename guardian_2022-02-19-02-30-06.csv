2/19/2022,"My friend Robert Milsom, who has died aged 80 after a decade of Parkinson’s disease, was a legal aid solicitor who often defended the poor and outcast – and sometimes the seriously criminal. He was well known in Cambridge, where grateful former clients would approach him in the street and hug him. Robert had a deep-seated belief that everyone has the right to put forward the best defence possible. Born in Crimplesham, Norfolk, he inherited nonconformist values from his mother, Betty (nee Hunt), a teacher, and his father, Charles, a tenant farmer.  He attended Culford school near Bury St Edmunds and gained an award to Queens’ College, Cambridge, to study history. We met at Cambridge, first through CND, then in the Labour club, and both joined an early equality protest in November 1960 when we helped some female students to sneak into the then male-only Cambridge Union Society debate. Robert was a gentle, non-sectarian but principled and passionate idealist. We both went on anti-war demonstrations with the Committee of 100, a breakaway group from CND committed to non-violent direct action. On one occasion, at RAF Wethersfield in 1961, Robert insisted on the principle of being arrested and was charged with obstruction. I visited him on remand in Norwich jail. He was given a conditional discharge. After graduating in 1963, he trained as a teacher, also at Cambridge, but went to work in the education department of the TUC. In 1973, he moved to Birmingham to teach history at Fircroft College, a grant-aided, adult residential college with a Quaker tradition and connected to the trade union movement. Two years later its students, backed by staff, decided to rewrite their curriculum, which they saw as patronising and geared to “improving the working classes”. They wanted a more participatory style of teaching and discussion of philosophy, politics and history, and to hold debates. Initially they were supported by the principal. But this soured, and after an inquiry the trustees sacked all the staff except the principal. Although this seemed like a miserable outcome, Robert was impossible to extinguish. He moved to Cambridge and retrained as a solicitor by correspondence. Qualifying rapidly, he found his metier, and worked for various firms in the city. He retired from Shelley and Co in 2013. Robert had a lifelong interest in the radical politics of the 17th century and after retirement he taught a course on Oliver Cromwell at the University of the Third Age. On 1964 Robert married Penny Kaldor. She survives him, along with their sons Tom and Ben. A third son, Paul, died in December 2021.",News/Law,Robert Milsom obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/feb/18/robert-milsom-obituary
2/19/2022,"Only two Black Americans had won an individual medal in nearly a century of Winter Olympics before this week. It took less than 24 hours for Erin Jackson and Elana Meyers Taylor to double that list. When Jackson ended a couple of lengthy speed skating medal droughts for the United States in a sport they once dominated by winning Sunday night’s women’s 500m, the roller derby skater from central Florida became the first Black woman from any country to win an individual gold in a Winter Olympics event according to the Olympedia.org website, the most comprehensive database about the Olympic Games.  Then on Monday afternoon, Meyers Taylor took silver in the inaugural monobob event to add a fourth Olympic medal to her career haul – equalling the speed skater Shani Davis as the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Games history – with a warm chance for a record-breaking fifth when the two-woman bobsleigh heats conclude on Saturday night. Black History Month in the US has always coincided with the Winter Olympics on the calendar, but it’s fair to say that any overlap between the two have almost entirely ended there. The Games have been an overwhelmingly lilywhite affair favoring richer, colder nations despite mixed efforts by the International Olympic Committee to increase diversity through quota systems without compromising elite competitive standards. But the 29-year-old Jackson, a former inline skater with an engineering degree from the University of Florida who made the US team for the 2018 Olympics after only four months on the ice, believes there is no reason that more young athletes of color can’t thrive in winter sports if given the opportunities. She hopes that her headline-grabbing success on the global stage can help get that message across. “I hope I can be an example,” Jackson said. “I would love to see more people of color in all the winter sports. It helps to have some visibility out there, to be able to see other people like you doing something maybe you’d never thought about doing before.” America’s first sprint queen since Bonnie Blair is one of three US long‑track medallists in Beijing – along with Brittany Bowe, who earned bronze in the women’s 1,000m, and Joey Mantia, who took men’s team pursuit bronze – to hail from Ocala, the central Florida city more than an hour’s drive from the closest ice rink which has become an improbable speed skating hotbed. All three got their start there and trained under the same youth coach, Renee Hildebrand, who helped guide each to inline world championships before their transitions to the ice. Jackson surprised everyone, starting with herself, by making the US team for the 2018 Olympics after only four months on ice, finishing 24th out of 31 competitors in the 500m at Pyeongchang. She has since blossomed into the top‑ranked sprinter in the world with four wins in eight World Cup races this season, making good on her favorite status in Beijing with Team USA’s first individual speed skating medal of any color in 12 years and the first by an American woman since 2002. Among the earliest spoils of victory was a namecheck by the Oscar-winning actor Viola Davis. Meyers Taylor, already the only woman to win three Olympic bobsleigh medals for the US before Monday’s fourth, began campaigning for the addition of a four-woman event to the Olympic programme eight years ago with Kaillie Humphries, the then Canadian star who has since changed affiliations to the US. Their goal was to offer women the same medal opportunities as men, leading the pair to drive four-man sleds against men’s teams to make their point. But international officials ultimately approved the addition of women’s monobob instead – where only the driver is in the sled – citing the lack of depth in female bobsleigh programmes globally and framing it as a better choice for inclusion. While it might not have been the outcome Meyers Taylor and Humphries set out to achieve in a gender-equity sense, the potential to add geographic diversity is welcome consolation. Jackson and Meyers Taylor remain outliers at the Winter Games both on the field of play and – it must be said – in the press room. But a glance at Team USA’s roster shows encouraging if incremental signs of progress that can broaden the popularity of winter sports and potentially the pool of talent down the road. Kelly Curtis, a decorated heptathlete at Division III’s Springfield College who caught the Olympic bug on a family trip to Atlanta after the city hosted the 1996 Games, became the first Black skeleton athlete to compete for the United States, joining Great Britain’s Brogan Crowley and Italy’s Valentina Margaglio as the only women of color in the field. “It’s pretty important. It’s part of my identity, but it’s not the only thing that I lean on,” Curtis said. “I would like to be known as one of the best sliders. It’s nice with a cherry on top to be known as the first Black Olympian for USA Skeleton, but I would also like to be one of the best. So that’s really what I’m trying to progress toward every time I go out there and slide.” Abby Roque, a forward on the United States’ silver medal-winning women’s ice hockey team, made history as the first Indigenous woman to play for the vaunted national side. The 24-year-old grew up in the Minnesota town of Sault Ste Marie on the US-Canada border and is a member of the Wahnapitae First Nations tribe on her father’s side. She was joined on the ice in Thursday’s gold medal game by Canada’s Jocelyne Larocque and Jamie Lee Rattray, who both hail from the Métis Nation. “It’s super exciting,” Roque said. “It’s something that I definitely take pride in and that I think is a great honour, but it’s also something that I hope we continue to grow. “I hope there are more indigenous kids playing in the US, more kids who will make the Olympic roster some day. I wanted to be the first because I wanted to be on this roster, but I wish I wasn’t the first, I wish there were indigenous players on this roster before me.” For Jackson, winning a historic gold is only the start. She’s been partnering with Edge Sports, a Washington state nonprofit that works to bring more diversity to snow sports and promote the normalization of Black and brown bodies on ice rinks and ski slopes around the country, about establishing a chapter in Utah where she lives today. Her goals include eliminating barriers to entry by providing scholarships for winter sports to people of color. “Hopefully it has an effect,” Jackson said after Sunday’s rousing win, “and we can see more minorities, especially in the USA, getting out and trying some of these winter sports. And I just always hope to be a good example, especially with helping kids see they don’t have to just choose one between schools and sport.”",Sport/Sport,Jackson and Meyers Taylor have made history in Beijing for Black Americans,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/18/jackson-and-meyers-taylor-have-made-history-in-beijing-for-black-americans
2/19/2022,"A woman punched a 6ft shark in the face until it let go of her foot, which it bit while she snorkeled off the Dry Tortugas, islands off the coast of Florida. Heather West, 42 and from Texas, told the Daily Mail the lemon shark “kept tugging and tugging, and I could feel its teeth in my ankle”.  Lemon sharks can grow to 11ft and inhabit coastal waters, close to swimmers, surfers and divers. But they present little threat to humans. According to the International Shark Attack File, at the University of Florida, before West’s encounter there had been only 10 unprovoked attacks by lemon sharks, all in Florida and the Caribbean, none fatal. “Caution is still warranted as they are a large predatory species,” the ISAF says. In any year, the US accounts for about half of unprovoked shark attacks worldwide. The vast majority are not fatal. Most bites are exploratory. Sharks eat seals, turtles and fish. Sustained attacks on humans resulting in fatalities, as in Sydney, Australia this week, are likely to be cases of mistaken identity. In a recent book, Emperors of the Deep: Sharks, the Ocean’s Most Mysterious, Most Misunderstood and Most Important Guardians, George Burgess, a University of Florida professor and ISAF organiser, tells author William McKeever: “The major reason more attacks are in the United States is we’ve got a very large coastline … and of course lots of people. “And we are also a nation of some wealth and means, and so we can afford to spend time at the beach. And of course many areas of the country are heavy tourist areas.” West lives in a van, traveling the US and updating an Instagram account. She told the Mail she was heading back to shore when the lemon shark bit her. “I was wearing flippers and my kick wasn’t doing much damage,” she said, “so I decided to lean forward and start punching it. “I punched it in the face over and over again as hard as I possibly could, and after about 30 seconds it finally let go. “For the next two minutes I was in complete shock and couldn’t swim, but by this point my friends had ran back in the water to help me.” The Dry Tortugas are home to a 19th-century fort – where Samuel Mudd, a doctor who treated the man who killed Abraham Lincoln, was once imprisoned – but little else. Fortunately for West, two park rangers were nearby, setting traps for rats. They helped apply tourniquets to her leg and get her to the mainland for treatment. West said: ‘When I got to the shore I just started screaming ‘I won, I won’, because I realised I still had my foot. ‘In the water I was convinced he’d bitten it off, so seeing it still there, even though it was completely mangled, was a huge relief.” On Instagram, West shared footage of the bite and its aftermath and said doctors in Key West told her she would probably regain full use of her foot. The shark, she said, might have been the same one sighted in similar waters earlier, trying to eat a pelican. West said: “Despite all of this, I want the record to show that I love sharks, and don’t want to discourage people from getting in the water. As a matter of fact I’ll be right back in as soon as I heal up.”",News/Environment,Woman escapes shark by punching it on nose off Florida coast,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/18/woman-escapes-shark-by-punching-florida
2/19/2022,"Jimmy Kimmel responded to news on Thursday evening that Melania Trump was selling NFTs, AKA non-fungible tokens, to commemorate her husband’s presidency. “Until today, I thought a blockchain was what Melania had on her bedroom door, to protect her from the bored ape in the next room,” Kimmel joked.  Melania’s Potus NFT collection will supposedly include 10,000 NFTs priced at $50 each that will highlight “iconic” moments from the Trump administration. “How would she even know what the iconic moments from his administration were?” Kimmel wondered. “Half the time she was first lady, she hid in her room. The other half she spent bitching about Christmas decorations.” The weirdest part, Kimmel added, was that collectors will “enjoy an element of surprise” as the artwork for each NFT would be revealed only after purchase. “So you send Melania your money and in return, you’ll get whatever they decide to send back,” he mused. “Where do I line up? What a deal that sounds like.” On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert touched on the truckers’ protest in Canada, which has paralyzed the capital for weeks and caused the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, to invoke emergency powers. Earlier this week, the Canadian government declared a state of emergency as the so-called “Freedom Convoy” protesters, who have called for an end to Covid vaccine mandates, continued to occupy Ottawa. “As with anything that pisses people off, American conservatives are all for it,” Colbert explained, such as MyPillow CEO and Trump acolyte Mike Lindell, who declared he would send 10,000 pillows to the “brave” truckers. The shipment contained “almost as many as are on the bed in your great aunt’s guest room,” Colbert quipped. “These protesters are camped out in the cold – they need food and fuel, not 10,000 pillows!” Lindell packed up his 10,000-pillow convoy and headed for the border … where he was turned back because he was not fully vaccinated and did not have a negative PCR test. “He couldn’t support the vax mandate protesters because he wasn’t fully vaxxed. How can you describe that?” Colbert asked, cueing up a clip from the Canadian singer Alanis Morissette’s song Ironic. And on Full Frontal, Samantha Bee debunked the latest front of the GOP’s culture war: the Biden administration’s investment in harm reduction programs for drug abuse. “Republicans love to manufacture controversy that sends their base into a frenzy that will eventually, I’m sure, lead them to burn someone in a wicker man to get a better vote harvest,” Bee explained. “Unsurprisingly though, conservatives are also scaring their base by leaning into that classic racist rhetoric, the ‘war on drugs’. “But while Republicans are acting like the Biden administration harm reduction grant would basically be a gift card to Drugs ‘R’ Us, the truth is far less stupid.” The Biden administration has pledged to invest $30m to support harm-reduction services that include treatment, prevention and syringe exchanges and smoking kits. “On one hand, this would be the first-of-its-kind federal grant that would pay for harm reduction tools to help save the lives of people suffering from addiction,” said Bee. “On the other, this goes against the official Republican drug policy of ‘go fuck yourself’.” Hence why the usual cast of Fox News commentators – Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, Jesse Watters and others – have misrepresented the evidence-based program as a free handout of crack pipes. The Biden administration has since responded to the faux scandal and confirmed that distribution of crack pipes was never part of the program. “Rather than kowtowing to Republicans, Democrats should be focused on something even more important: harm reduction actually fucking works during a time when we need it to work,” said Bee, as drug overdose deaths increased 28.5% over the previous year. “If harm reduction works, why are Republicans so against it?” she added. “Because conservatives’ ongoing panic over drugs was never about helping people. It was about using racial stereotypes to arrest people of color.” The largest share of resources during the Reagan administration’s “war on drugs”, Bee pointed out, went to policing crack cocaine and incarcerating black and brown people. This, “when referencing crack, conservatives know they’re appealing to a decades-long racist stereotype that riles up their base – that’s the whole point!” Bee said. “If they can discredit policies like harm reduction, they can both make Democrats look bad and keep jailing people of color. For them, it’s probably just a bonus that rebooting the crack panic will likely lead to more death and suffering,” she concluded. “Unfortunately, by hedging their commitment to harm reduction, the Biden administration is inadvertently helping give credence to a bullshit morality about who deserves help.”",Arts/Culture,Kimmel on NFTs: ‘I thought a blockchain was what Melania had on her door’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/18/jimmy-kimmel-melania-trump-nft-ottawa-protest-late-night-recap
2/19/2022,"Mohammed al-Tajer was caught off guard when his iPhone pinged last November with a warning that said his phone had been targeted by a nation state. The 55-year-old lawyer from Bahrain had been known among dissidents for his “fearless” defence of opposition leaders and protesters after the 2011 pro-democracy uprising in the tiny Gulf state, when a series of demonstrations and protests were violently suppressed by authorities with the help of Saudi forces.  Tajer had not been involved in human rights issues for five years, however – the last time he’d been rounded up and threatened with arrest by Bahraini authorities. But a forensic examination of Tajer’s phone by researchers at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto has found that the lawyer’s phone was hacked on multiple occasions in September 2021 by a government client of NSO Group, the Israeli spyware maker. “I used to be head of Bahrain Human Rights Observatory, used to have human rights activities inside Bahrain or with the UN. But now I don’t have any ongoing human rights activities,” Tajer, who is still in Bahrain, told Red Line for Gulf (RL4G), a non-profit collection of journalists and activists who are focused on digital security and freedom of expression in gulf states and worked with Citizen Lab on the recent investigation. “The worst and most harmful thing is you feel you are not secure. That instead of your phone being your friend, it is now your enemy. You don’t know what information is private, and what is already exposed to the state, this is painful.” A separate investigation by the Pegasus Project – a media consortium investigating NSO Group which includes the Guardian and is coordinated by the French non-profit Forbidden Stories – has also identified 20 Bahraini officials who are close to the government and may have been targeted for surveillance. Their phone numbers were identified with the help of Ali Abdulemam of RL4G. The mobile numbers – including those of loyalists close to Bahrain’s ruling family – appeared on a leaked database that the Pegasus Project believes contains the phone numbers of individuals who were selected as possible surveillance targets by clients of NSO. The mobile phone of a US state department official who was stationed in Bahrain at the time of her selection also appears on the leaked database. The state department did not respond to a request for comment. The Biden administration added NSO to a commerce department blacklist last year, citing evidence that the technology has been used by foreign governments to “maliciously target” embassy workers, journalists and activists, among others. While the appearance of a person’s mobile number is not evidence that the person was hacked, the Pegasus Project has previously published stories about dozens of individuals – including journalists and human rights activists – whose numbers appear on the list and whose phones were targeted or hacked by clients of NSO, according to security researchers at Amnesty International who forensically examined the devices. The individuals who were selected as possible candidates for surveillance include 20 members of the Bahrain council of representatives, speaker Fawzia Zainal, who was appointed by the king and selected between January and March 2019, and Ahmed Sabah al-Salloum, an MP and member of the National Institution of Human Rights, an organisation that is funded by the government of Bahrain. The Pegasus Project also identified two members of the royal family who were listed in the leaked database, including Khalid Bin Ahmed Khalifa, the former minister of foreign affairs. The individuals declined to comment on their appearance on the list. An NSO spokesperson said: “The misuse of cyber intelligence tools is a serious matter and all credible allegations must be investigated, if and when the relevant information would be provided. The continued reporting of unsubstantiated allegations by uninformed sources is unfortunate and wrong.” The series of revelations, security experts said, paint a picture of a state that appears poised to use surveillance technology against its perceived enemies and friends alike. When successfully deployed against a target, Pegasus can infiltrate a mobile phone, giving the user of the spyware full access to phone calls, text messages, encrypted messages and photographs. It can track a mobile phone user’s location and turn the phone into a remote listening device. “The situation in Bahrain is still pretty repressive,” said Bill Marczak, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab. “Since 2011 Bahrain has really made it a point to try and remove institutions that help people to organise. “There is no space for dissent or activism, and spyware helps preserve this status quo. Because what they can do is keep an eye on what is going on in private, they can make sure there is nothing bubbling over in private.” NSO has said its government clients are only meant to use Pegasus spyware to target serious criminals and terrorists. The company has strongly denied that the leaked database has any connection to the Israeli firm and said the phone numbers on the list are not targets of NSO customers. What is in the data leak? The data leak is a list of more than 50,000 phone numbers that, since 2016, are believed to have been selected as those of people of interest by government clients of NSO Group, which sells surveillance software. The data also contains the time and date that numbers were selected, or entered on to a system. Forbidden Stories, a Paris-based nonprofit journalism organisation, and Amnesty International initially had access to the list and shared access with 16 media organisations including the Guardian. More than 80 journalists have worked together over several months as part of the Pegasus project. Amnesty’s Security Lab, a technical partner on the project, did the forensic analyses. What does the leak indicate? The consortium believes the data indicates the potential targets NSO’s government clients identified in advance of possible surveillance. While the data is an indication of intent, the presence of a number in the data does not reveal whether there was an attempt to infect the phone with spyware such as Pegasus, the company’s signature surveillance tool, or whether any attempt succeeded. The presence in the data of a very small number of landlines and US numbers, which NSO says are “technically impossible” to access with its tools, reveals some targets were selected by NSO clients even though they could not be infected with Pegasus. However, forensic examinations of a small sample of mobile phones with numbers on the list found tight correlations between the time and date of a number in the data and the start of Pegasus activity – in some cases as little as a few seconds.  What did forensic analysis reveal? Amnesty examined 67 smartphones where attacks were suspected. Of those, 23 were successfully infected and 14 showed signs of attempted penetration. For the remaining 30, the tests were inconclusive, in several cases because the handsets had been replaced. Fifteen of the phones were Android devices, none of which showed evidence of successful infection. However, unlike iPhones, phones that use Android do not log the kinds of information required for Amnesty’s detective work. Three Android phones showed signs of targeting, such as Pegasus-linked SMS messages. Amnesty shared “backup copies” of four iPhones with Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto that specialises in studying Pegasus, which confirmed that they showed signs of Pegasus infection. Citizen Lab also conducted a peer review of Amnesty’s forensic methods, and found them to be sound. Which NSO clients were selecting numbers? While the data is organised into clusters, indicative of individual NSO clients, it does not say which NSO client was responsible for selecting any given number. NSO claims to sell its tools to 60 clients in 40 countries, but refuses to identify them. By closely examining the pattern of targeting by individual clients in the leaked data, media partners were able to identify 10 governments believed to be responsible for selecting the targets: Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, India, and the United Arab Emirates. Citizen Lab has also found evidence of all 10 being clients of NSO. What does NSO Group say? You can read NSO Group’s full statement here. The company has always said it does not have access to the data of its customers’ targets. Through its lawyers, NSO said the consortium had made “incorrect assumptions” about which clients use the company’s technology. It said the 50,000 number was “exaggerated” and that the list could not be a list of numbers “targeted by governments using Pegasus”. The lawyers said NSO had reason to believe the list accessed by the consortium “is not a list of numbers targeted by governments using Pegasus, but instead, may be part of a larger list of numbers that might have been used by NSO Group customers for other purposes”. They said it was a list of numbers that anyone could search on an open source system. After further questions, the lawyers said the consortium was basing its findings “on misleading interpretation of leaked data from accessible and overt basic information, such as HLR Lookup services, which have no bearing on the list of the customers' targets of Pegasus or any other NSO products ... we still do not see any correlation of these lists to anything related to use of NSO Group technologies”. Following publication, they explained that they considered a ""target"" to be a phone that was the subject of a successful or attempted (but failed) infection by Pegasus, and reiterated that the list of 50,000 phones was too large for it to represent ""targets"" of Pegasus. They said that the fact that a number appeared on the list was in no way indicative of whether it had been selected for surveillance using Pegasus.  What is HLR lookup data? The term HLR, or home location register, refers to a database that is essential to operating mobile phone networks. Such registers keep records on the networks of phone users and their general locations, along with other identifying information that is used routinely in routing calls and texts. Telecoms and surveillance experts say HLR data can sometimes be used in the early phase of a surveillance attempt, when identifying whether it is possible to connect to a phone. The consortium understands NSO clients have the capability through an interface on the Pegasus system to conduct HLR lookup inquiries. It is unclear whether Pegasus operators are required to conduct HRL lookup inquiries via its interface to use its software; an NSO source stressed its clients may have different reasons – unrelated to Pegasus – for conducting HLR lookups via an NSO system. Bahrain’s embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. Citizen Lab’s analysis found that Tajer, the lawyer, was hacked with Pegasus spyware just one week after a previous report by the Toronto-based lab detailed nine other cases of Bahrain activists who were targeted with spyware. The researchers have also identified a journalist, who they have not named, who was also targeted with NSO spyware. Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of advocacy at the UK-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy, said Bahrain had witnessed a decade of “systematic repression” since the events of 2011. Intent on ensuring there would not be any other uprisings, Al Wadaei said the government was seeking to keep all activists and political actors “within their control”. “I guess this is really the new reality, that they want to ensure that this is not going to happen again,” Alwadaei said.",News/News,‘You don’t know what is private’: how spyware erodes human rights in Bahrain,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/18/how-spyware-erodes-human-rights-in-bahrain-nso-group-pegasus-project
2/19/2022,"Few video games in recent years have managed to equal the sledgehammer disappointment of Cuphead. For those of you not in the know, Cuphead was an independent 2017 game that captured gamers’ imagination like little else before. This was almost entirely down to how it looked. An out-and-out love letter to 1930s cartoonists such as Max Fleischer and Grim Natwick – with a main character inspired by a 1936 Japanese propaganda cartoon about an invasion of an evil Mickey Mouse army – Cuphead thrummed with a gloriously authentic Betty Boop feel. The animations were hand-drawn and imperfect. The big-band jazz soundtrack was recorded on analogue. The voices crackled and hissed as if recorded from worn vinyl. No detail was spared, to the extent that the creators had to remortgage their home to pay for it. And people fell for Cuphead hard. After some initial footage was shown as proof of concept, anticipation hit fever pitch and stayed there for three years.  But then the game came out, and it sort of sucked. It might have looked and sounded beautiful, but it was also cripplingly difficult to play. One early reviewer (who plays games for a living, remember) noted that he had died 188 times during the game. It seemed like such a wasted opportunity. And yet, despite this, the kernel of Cuphead remained irresistible. The characters were so engaging, and the aesthetic so beautiful, that a small cottage industry sprang up around it. You might not be able to get past the level where you have to steal the soul from a giant onion (long story), but you could still buy Cuphead dolls and Cuphead books, and you could visit YouTube and watch a seemingly limitless number of users create no end of Cuphead songs, cartoons and comparison videos. The game might have caused you to rip out your hair in frustration, but the characters were too charming to be dismissed. Which brings us to The Cuphead Show! (Netflix), in which the Cuphead characters are given their own series of 15-minute cartoons. It might sound complicated – a cartoon based on a game based on a different cartoon – but go along with it. Because The Cuphead Show! feels like Cuphead reaching its most perfect form. The show sees Cuphead (a headstrong and cocky sentient cup) and his brother Mugman (in effect, a differently coloured Cuphead created solely to allow a two-player mode on the game, here beefed up into a cowardly Luigi type) as they blunder through a succession of wacky misadventures. While there’s a loose nod to the game’s plot – in which Cuphead and Mugman lose their souls by gambling with the devil, who in turn forces them to chase down his debtors – this is by no means a dramatisation. Instead, The Cuphead Show! is a collection of standalone cartoons that have fun splashing around in the tropes of the era its animation was inspired by. This is the sort of cartoon where characters find babies abandoned by their front door, where radio antennas broadcast concentric circles and morse code, where down-and-outs still have the self-esteem to dress themselves in raggedy suits. It is at once a giddy genre exercise and something that your kids would happily watch. For the most part, that is. There’s one scene near the end of the series, where the devil mutates into a series of wild animals, that has the potential to ruin a couple of bedtimes. But, again, for a show that deliberately harkens back to a time where entertainment wouldn’t hesitate to scare kids, that’s probably par for the course. Weirdly, though, Cuphead’s period frills don’t feel quite as authentic on TV. This is partly a tonal thing. Cuphead the game was so rigorously 1930s in its outlook that one of the levels saw him standing in an ashtray, fighting a barrage of cigars and cigarettes, and that would obviously be unthinkable to place in a children’s TV show in the 21st century. But it’s also down to execution, too. Although the surface touches are there – the screen is flecked with dust marks – the characters often carry the sterile perfection of computer animation, while the voices are recorded a little too cleanly. You can understand why these compromises were made, since two and a half hours of hand-drawn animation would be prohibitively expensive, but for a property that prides itself on authenticity, it can sometimes take you out of the moment a little. These are just niggles, though. All in all, The Cuphead Show is an overwhelming success. It’s fast and funny and knowing, and you almost certainly won’t die 188 times watching it.

2/19/2022,"A never-before-seen masterpiece by Mark Rothko and one of Andy Warhol’s last self-portraits are among the dozens of works to be auctioned this spring as part of the sale of one of the greatest collections of modern contemporary art ever assembled. The Macklowe collection, which was amassed by the real estate magnate Harry Macklowe and Linda Burg, an honorary trustee of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, is being sold to help settle the billionaire couple’s acrimonious divorce.  Last November, more than $676m (£503m) was paid for the first half of the collection, in the most valuable single-auction ever staged and the most valuable action held by Sotheby’s, one of the world’s leading art houses. On Friday, Sotheby’s revealed a further 30 works, which will be offered at auction in New York in May. Highlights were unveiled in London by Will Gompertz, director of arts of the Barbican, and Eleanor Nairne, a curator at the Barbican. Among these were Rothko’s Untitled from 1960, a rich oxblood-coloured and meditative piece from a critical moment in the artist’s career, which is expected to fetch $35m-$50m. The work demonstrates Rothko’s deepening palate, as he moved away from the bright colours he used in the mid-1950s to more emotive ones. One of Warhol’s final works, a monumental self-portrait painted as he contemplated his own legacy and status, is expected to fetch $15m-$20m. Vanitas: Skulls and Self Portraits by Andy Warhol is part of the artist’s “fright wig” series of work from 1986. Warhol’s use of camouflage depicts his performative relationship with identity and his sense of playfulness. The artist died just nine months after making the work. Gerhard Richter’s Seestück (Seascape), a large-scale painting from 1975, capturing the beauty of the natural world, will also be sold, as will two paintings by Willem de Kooning – Untitled, from 1961, and Untitled XIII, from 1984. Other artists including Alberto Giacometti, Pablo Picasso, and Jeff Koons also feature. “The November sale of 35 works from the Macklowe Collection captivated top collectors around the world and set records in the process,” said Charles F Stewart, Sotheby’s chief executive officer. “We are thrilled to present a further 30 works from this legendary collection in May, in what is sure to be another highly anticipated sale.” The Macklowes built up their art collection over almost six decades of marriage. The couple were renowned for making barbed exchanges at public events, and their marital strife eventually resulted in a divorce. But neither they nor their lawyers could agree on the value of their art collection, so a judge ordered that they be sold. Brooke Lampley, the Sotheby’s chairman and worldwide head of sales for global fine art, said the collection told “the story of art in its highest form, with the utmost precision of clarity. Every artist here is represented at a moment of profound creativity”.",Arts/Art and design,Rothko and Warhol among ‘legendary’ art collection being sold in divorce,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/18/rothko-and-warhol-among-legendary-art-collection-being-sold-in-divorce
2/19/2022,"A hitman who murdered a reality television star’s brother in a “tit-for-tat gang war” has been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 35 years. The Metropolitan police described the case as one of the most complex murder investigations in recent history.  Flamur Beqiri, 36, was shot dead on the doorstep of his £1.7m home in Battersea, south-west London, in front of his wife as she shielded their two-year-old son on Christmas Eve 2019. Beqiri, the brother of The Real Housewives of Cheshire star Misse Beqiri, was a kingpin in an international drugs gang, Southwark crown court was told during the trial, which concluded last week. Anis Hemissi, 24, a professional kickboxer from Sweden, was hired as an assassin to fly into London to carry out the murder, which the trial heard was meticulously planned for up to six months. Estevan Pino-Munizaga, an accomplice, rented a flat in Oyster Wharf, visited Beqiri’s house nearby and bought a distinctive ladies’ bicycle with a basket. Another associate bought a litter picker on a later trip to London. The bike was used by Hemissi to carry out reconnaissance three days before the murder, once dressed as a street cleaner, wearing a latex mask, sunglasses and hi-vis work clothes, while holding the litter picker and a black bin bag. The outfit and bike were abandoned when a local resident, Jeremy Lyons, became suspicious after seeing Hemissi working on public and private streets, telling him: “Get away from this estate, please.” The Swede acquired a replacement bike, which he parked on the Thames path and used to make his getaway after carrying out the shooting. Hemissi, who flew into London on 20 December, left the country to go to Copenhagen in the early hours of Christmas Day. He was arrested on his return after a holiday in Thailand. He was sentenced on Friday after being found guilty of murder and possession of a firearm. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb described the murder as “international crime at its most brutal”. She said: “Flamur Beqiri, a Swedish citizen with Albanian origins, was suspected of involvement in international drug dealing and other serious crime. He was also a son, a partner and a father. His children will never know him and nothing the court does can comfort them, or reconcile those who loved him to their loss. “Anis Hemissi, on the evidence, there is no doubt that, aged just 22, with no previous convictions, in 2019 you were a gun for hire. The intricate planning that enabled you to arrive in London just a few days before shooting that man dead in front of his family as they were walking to their front door on Christmas Eve, also enabled you to leave the country within hours of his death. “This was international crime at its most brutal.” Pino-Munizaga, 35, visited London for about 14 hours in November 2019 to rent the flat where Hemissi stayed, visit Beqiri’s house nearby and buy the bicycle. He was jailed for 15 years, of which he will serve two-thirds, after being acquitted of murder but found guilty of manslaughter. Clifford Rollox, 31, from Islington, north London, and Dutch national Claude Isaac Castor, 31, from Sint Maarten in the Caribbean, were each jailed for three years after being found guilty of perverting the course of justice, having been hired locally to clean up and remove evidence, including the gun, from the flat.",News/UK news,Flamur Beqiri murder: hitman jailed for 35 years,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/18/flamur-beqiri-hhitman-jailed-for-35-years

2/19/2022,"Antonio Conte has said he is happy to speak directly to his chairman, Daniel Levy, about any contentious issues at Tottenham after the club barred him from conducting interviews with the Italian media. During an interview with Sky Sport Italia this week Tottenham’s politically astute Italian manager appeared to suggest his squad had been “weakened” by the board’s decision to allow four “important” players to leave during January while recruiting only two replacements and said the club’s transfer policy would slow the rate at which he can make the team competitive.  Conte implied on Friday that the English media were endeavouring to drive a wedge between him and Levy. “It created a bit of a disturbance,” he said. “I don’t understand why someone wants to create a problem with me; not only me but also coaches in the past. I read a lot of stories in the past about the club and it creates a problem with the coach and the chairman. “The chairman knows very well my thoughts. If I have to speak with him, I go to speak with him. It’s not important for me to go to the media. I can speak to him. “I was a bit disturbed by this situation especially because I had an interview with the Italian media. It means the club now doesn’t want me to speak to Italian media because the translation was not so clear in my thoughts.” Conte said he had told Sky Italia that Tottenham had done the best they could in the transfer window and that “we are more complete” with the arrivals of Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur from Juventus. “I think I was very, very clear,” he said. Spurs travel to Manchester City on Saturday evening aiming to arrest a run of three straight Premier League defeats which have seen Conte’s side slip to eighth, seven points adrift of a top-four place with games in hand. His mood was not improved by Storm Eunice forcing the cancellation of Tottenham’s flight to Manchester on Friday, leaving the squad facing a road trip, but Conte at least welcomed Eric Dier’s return after a thigh injury. Dier, described as “an important player” by his manager, will almost certainly be called to arms, particularly as Conte regards City as near flawless. “They are maybe the best in the world and almost perfect,” he said. “On one side you have a team in a fantastic period of form and on other other you have a team trying to build something important for the future. At the moment, we are on two different levels.” Given that Conte had earlier reminded his audience he was accustomed to “challenging for titles”, he was asked whether the Spurs job was turning out to be not quite as advertised. “I always said I’m enjoying my time with Tottenham, enjoying working with these players,” he replied. “We have four months until the end of the season and we have to try to do our best to finish in the best position – and then we will see.”",Sport/Football,Antonio Conte told by Tottenham to stop speaking to Italian media ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/18/antonio-conte-told-by-tottenham-to-stop-speaking-to-italian-media-daniel-levy
2/19/2022,"It’s been a strange old day here at Fiver Towers, what with the gale force winds of Storm Eunice having blown the corrugated roof clean off our bijou wattle hut. All the better to afford us a clear view of nonplussed cows, unsecured trampolines and wheelie bins whirling through the sky like a scene from The Wizard of Oz.  But while Eunice might sound like a kindly, slightly maiden aunt from a Famous Five novel, the storm which has taken her name has dominated the headlines in Blighty, a state of affairs likely to raise “oh look, the Brits are at it again”-inspired eyebrows among Fiver readers from countries with less forgiving climates. The kind where a monsoon, hurricane or howling blizzard are little more than daily inconveniences and the odd roof-tile dislodged by a rogue squall isn’t guaranteed to make the front page of the local paper. The British have always had a peculiar, weirdly obsessive relationship with the weather and it is never more apparent than when the weather is either very good or very bad. Today, the Fiver was among several hundred thousand folk who tuned into Big Jet TV on YouTube, to watch aircraft of all shapes and sizes try to land at Heathrow in the face of 85mph crosswinds. All while a preposterously enthusiastic plane nerd and cameraman stood in an adjacent field shouting “Easy! Easy! Easy! Go on son! Wowwwwwwwww! That’s a big swing man! Bosh, he’s done it!” Meanwhile on assorted news bulletins, presenters kept cutting to barely audible, soaking wet reporters standing dangerously close to storm-battered piers, cliff edges and flooding rivers as they warned viewers that under no circumstances should they go anywhere near storm-battered piers, cliff edges and flooding rivers …. “UNLESS IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY!” And what has all this got to do with football, you might ask – quite apart from the fact that the decidedly inclement weather has interfered with Tottenham’s travel plans ahead of tomorrow’s defeat at the hands of Manchester City, and made their stadium do strange things. Eunice has also prompted the cancellations of trains Newcastle fans were hoping to get to London for their team’s win over West Ham, and caused the postponement of Bournemouth’s game against Nottingham Forest tonight. Today’s chaos also reminded the Fiver of the time when, in his post-football career as a mid-1980s Breakfast television talking head and resident contrarian, the late, great former Tottenham and England striker Jimmy Greaves went off on a diatribe about the ineptitude of weather forecasters. “I’ve lived through storms before in my life, I’ve lived through everything,” Greavsie mused, warming up nicely. “And the fact is that the weather people this year have got nothing right. Absolutely nothing! The biggest problem is that the Met Office doesn’t seem to be as boring and efficient as it used to be. Most of them are too interested in going on Blankety Blank and Call My Bluff and things like this, and they’re paying no attention to the weather!” Stay safe out there, readers. It’s raining truth. “There are times when I’m on the side of the pitch thinking: ‘What am I doing this for? I’m standing here, freezing my chuff off’ – the other manager is abusing you for something, and sometimes you just think: ‘Wow, this is some way to earn a living’” – Paul Warne, manager of League One leaders Rotherham, admits his job isn’t always fun as he gets his chat on with Ben Fisher. “Following JJ Zucal’s revelation that he spent two hours of his birthday watching a dull 0-0 draw: I spent my 30th birthday with my future wife at Glanford Park, watching Firewall FC 0-0 Crystal Palace. I’m a Palace fan, she was a Firewall season-ticket holder, so a draw was probably the best result but it was an awful game. Still, I’m pleased with how our teams’ fortunes have diverged since” – Chris Richardson. “Re: Gareth Southgate [Thursday’s Fiver]. Given it is 130-odd miles from England’s base at St George’s Park to Wembley and only 30-odd to Wolverhampton, playing at Molineux seems to be stretching the concept of ‘taking the squad on the road’” – Robin Hazlehurst. “With regard to Harry Maguire and Cristiano Ronaldo’s tussle for the United captaincy [see News, Bits and Bobs] – perhaps Ronaldo could adopt the ploy of the late, great Ben Hannigan of League of Ireland fame. When faced with a challenge to his authority, Ben gently put one arm around the misguided individual and said: ‘Look at the crowd. Do you think they came to see you or to see me?’” – John Weldon.

Manchester City have lost their appeal against Kyle Walker’s three-match Big Cup ban after he was sent off against Leipzig. The flying full-back will miss the second leg against Sporting and the first leg of their quarter-final – how will they cope? Harry Maguire has denied reports of a rift at Manchester United. “I’ve seen a lot of reports about this club that aren’t true and this is another,” he wailed. “Not going to start posting about everything that is written but I needed to make this one clear.” In other news, United’s interim manager, Ralf Rangnick (born 29 June, 1958) has backed Maguire to keep the armband. “Harry will stay our captain until the end of the season,” Rangnick straight-batted. Kieran Trippier has gone under the knife for his foot-gah, and may not play again this season for Newcastle. “We’re going to miss his leadership skills,” sobbed Eddie Howe. Liverpool, meanwhile, don’t know when Diogo Jota will be back from his ankle-knack. “It’s something with some ligaments in and around the ankle, but not the ligament, some others,” sighed Jürg. Before their meeting with Steven Gerrard’s Aston Villa, Watford’s Mr Roy has praised the impact of former England players Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney on the management game. “I’m delighted they have chosen that route because they have so much to give,” trilled Mr Roy. Janine Beckie’s fine strike levelled out Millie Bright’s opener as England’s Lionesses drew 1-1 with Canada in the SheBelieves Cup. Meanwhile, Trinity Rodman, daughter of Dennis, debuted as USA!

2/19/2022,"Pret a Manger’s owners have warned of doubts over its ability to continue as a going concern as the coffee shop chain faces uncertainty over future Covid restrictions and a shift to hybrid working. Accounts for Pret’s UK holding company filed this week show that last month it doubled its “standby facility” reserved to support the business in case of difficulty to £200m, up from the £100m set aside in March last year.  The latest cash call on shareholders comes on top of £100m pumped into the business in the autumn and £185m in 2020 when the company first warned of “material uncertainties” as sales were crushed by the pandemic. In the holding company accounts, which were signed off on 10 February, directors said there were still “material uncertainties which may cast significant doubt over the group’s ability to continue as a going concern”. They said that the possibility of further trading restrictions linked to Covid-19 and the associated unpredictability of consumer behaviour as well as uncertainty about the group’s ability to refinance a debt facility that expires in July next year were potential clouds over its financial position. The group, which had debts of almost £400m at the end of 2020, has been dramatically affected by the pandemic, during which it was forced to close some outlets for several months. The London-focused business has also been hit by the shift to working from home and a decline in tourist numbers in the capital. Last year, it emerged that sales at Pret a Manger (Europe), the group’s main trading company, dived to a pretax loss of £26m in the year to 2 January 2020 compared with a profit of nearly £49m a year before. That came as sales slipped to £708m from £710m and it bought the Eat chain. Like many other hospitality businesses, the group is also struggling with rising costs, which forced it to put up the price of its subscription service earlier this month shortly after increasing pay for its workers for the second time in four months. On Friday, Pret said its UK shops were trading at 93% of pre-pandemic levels, and much higher levels in regional and suburban shops. Pano Christou, the chief executive, said: “In September last year, we announced ambitious plans to double the size of Pret’s business over the next five years, backed by a £100m injection of funding from JAB and Pret co-founder, Sinclair Beecham. “Since announcing this strategy, Pret has continued to expand its business in the UK and internationally, and we’re confident that we will continue this pace of growth in the coming years. Despite the impact of Omicron on trade in December, our UK shops continue to recover strongly, with our coffee subscription used over a million times every week in the UK.”",News/Business,Pret a Manger’s future hangs in balance after new cash call,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/18/pret-a-manger-future-in-balance-cash-call-covid
2/19/2022,"The French virologist Luc Montagnier was a protagonist in one of the most acrimonious scientific disputes of the late 20th century. The disagreement, with the American scientist Robert Gallo, over who had discovered HIV and its role in causing Aids, was resolved only after the intervention of the US and French presidents, Ronald Reagan and Jacques Chirac. In 2008 Montagnier and his colleague Françoise Barré-Sinoussi were jointly awarded half of the Nobel prize for medicine. The rest of the prize went to Harald zur Hausen, for his unrelated discovery that human papillomaviruses cause cervical and other cancers. In later life Montagnier, who has died aged 89, alienated his own supporters after he promoted a range of fringe theories. He was a champion of the anti-vax movement, arguing that diseases including HIV could be cured by diet. When the Covid pandemic began, he claimed that Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, had originated in a lab experiment to combine coronavirus and HIV. He told viewers on French TV that vaccination was an “enormous mistake” that would promote the spread of new variants.  Reports of the Aids epidemic first appeared in the early 1980s, as gay men fell ill with a mysterious immunodeficiency syndrome. Barré-Sinoussi was working in Montagnier’s virology unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France’s premier biomedical research institute. In 1983 she isolated a retrovirus, which they called lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV), from the blood of patients with Aids. With typical scientific caution, their report concluded that it “may be involved in several pathological syndromes, including Aids”. Gallo, working at the US National Cancer Institute, had meanwhile identified a family of cancer-causing immunodeficiency retroviruses – RNA viruses that can insert a DNA copy of their genetic material into a host cell – that he called human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV). In 1984 he announced in a series of high-profile papers that a new member of this family, HTLV-III, could definitively be identified as the cause of Aids. The US government patented the blood test he had developed to detect antibodies to the virus before symptoms developed, which made it possible to screen donated blood. The row blew up not only because HTLV-III proved to be near-identical to LAV (and not closely related to HTLV-I and II), but also because material used in Gallo’s studies included samples that Montagnier had supplied from the Pasteur Institute in September 1983. Moreover, the Pasteur had applied for a US patent on blood tests for LAV four months earlier than Gallo; it sued the US government for its share of the proceeds. Before the case came to court, negotiation between the US and French governments led to a resolution that the two scientists should be equally credited with the discovery, both named on the patents, and that the millions of dollars in income from the blood test should be shared between their two institutions and an international Aids research foundation. The parties also agreed to name the virus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In 2002 Gallo and Montagnier published a joint paper acknowledging each other’s role: Montagnier’s lab discovered HIV, and Gallo’s proved it caused Aids. When Gallo was excluded from the Nobel prize, Montagnier declared himself as surprised as anyone. The dispute, against the backdrop of the human catastrophe of the Aids epidemic itself, proved to be such a cause célèbre that HBO made a TV film, And the Band Played On (1993), based on the 1987 book by Randy Shilts, in which Montagnier was played by the Belgian actor Patrick Bauchau and Gallo by the American Alan Alda. Montagnier was born in Chabris in the Indre region of France, and grew up near Poitiers, the only child of Marianne (nee Rousselet) and Antoine Montagnier, an accountant. After training in medicine at the universities of Poitiers and Paris, Montagnier began work on retroviruses in the UK, at the Medical Research Council Virus Research Unit in Carshalton, south London, and at Glasgow University, before setting up his own lab at the Pasteur Institute in 1972. In 1993 he established and led the World Foundation for Aids Research and Prevention. After the HIV controversy had substantially died down, he spent three years heading the centre for molecular and cellular biology at Queen’s College, City University of New York, before returning to the Pasteur Institute. In 2009, the year after he won the Nobel prize, he stunned scientific colleagues by publishing (in a journal he founded and edited himself) the claim that electromagnetic signals could be detected in water that had previously held DNA or RNA from viruses and bacteria. This was a variation on the “memory of water” theory that the discredited immunologist Jacques Benveniste put forward as an explanation for the efficacy of homeopathy. Montagnier also claimed that autism was caused by infection and could be cured by long-term antibiotic treatments. Scientists reacted with deep scepticism. From 2010 Montagnier spent a few years working at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China, where, he said, they were more “open-minded” about his ideas. In 2017 more than 100 members of the French academies of science and medicine published an open letter condemning him for spreading “dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge” after he opposed the extension of his country’s childhood vaccination programme. Montagnier married Dorothea Ackermann in 1961. She survives him, along with their three children, Anne-Marie, Francine and Jean-Luc.
