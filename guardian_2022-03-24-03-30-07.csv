3/24/2022,"Harry Kane is determined to shine a light on human rights abuses in Qatar with the help of captains from other national teams after expressing misgivings at the Gulf state hosting the World Cup at the end of the year. The England captain mentioned his Tottenham teammates Hugo Lloris and Son Heung-min – who captain France and South Korea respectively – and also former clubmates such as Gareth Bale – the captain of Wales, who hope to qualify – as he looked to rally strength in numbers to drive lasting social change. Kane and his England teammates were briefed at St George’s Park on Tuesday about the issues surrounding Qatar’s hosting of the finals – chiefly the rights of women, the LGBTQ+ community and migrant workers. Gareth Southgate, the England manager, led the conversation, with input from other Football Association members of staff, including Mark Bullingham, the chief executive, and Edleen John, the director of international relations, corporate affairs and co-partner for equality, diversity and inclusion. Southgate and Bullingham will travel to Qatar for the World Cup draw on Friday week and the FA is considering whether to give migrant workers a voice as part of any England media there. Kane said: “There’s a couple of other national captains at Tottenham or maybe it’s talking to other national team captains to see if we can be unified, what we try and do. We haven’t spoken about it yet but, over the next weeks and months, it’s definitely a conversation we should have because when you are together as nations and you have that unity in terms of captains, you can send a message. “It is something I will try to do. I think that will send out a bigger and more powerful message. It is part of the responsibility of a captain. It is important to talk about these things and not just hide away from them. And I know for sure the other lads will be happy to be talking about it, too. Hopefully we can make a real impact.” Kane was asked whether it was right that it had gone to Qatar. “It’s a hard question to answer, if I am totally honest,” he replied. “It wasn’t our decision, it was the decision of Fifa. “The World Cup is one of the greatest tournaments I have ever played in. There is definitely that excitement of being there and experiencing that again – 2018 was incredible for me and the other players involved. But there are some issues that you can’t hide away from. There are, of course, some conflicting emotions around it. “For me and our team it’s about controlling what we can control and that’s to make sure we do what we can and use our platforms to help in any way we can. But also still be excited about a major tournament. We will have to learn to cope with it and balance the two.” Kane admitted that in terms of gestures, the England squad were unclear, as yet, about what they may do. Some national teams in Europe have worn T-shirts and displayed banners that have drawn attention to the human rights issues in Qatar. What Kane did say he wanted to see was action that led to change which went far beyond the four weeks of the tournament. “Any issues that we are trying to resolve are trying to be resolved forever,” Kane said. “It is not just a quick fix. The fact there is a light shining on Qatar will help the situation and help us talk about it. Having these conversations now is definitely useful. But it is important those conversations carry on. “It is similar to taking the knee [in the fight against racism]. It is not just something we did for a small amount of time. By carrying on, we keep showing our support and that has been really important. I think the same thing will happen in Qatar and, after the tournament, it will be important to keep talking about the issues and make sure anything we do help or improve is for the rest of time, not just a few months.” England are preparing for Wembley friendlies against Switzerland and Ivory Coast on Saturday and next Tuesday.

3/24/2022,"Nicaragua’s ambassador to the Organization of American States has launched an extraordinary verbal attack on the authoritarian government he is employed to represent, castigating Daniel Ortega’s “indefensible” dictatorship for its assault on human rights and democracy. Arturo McFields Yescas spoke out during an online OAS session on Wednesday, in a startling declaration that spread quickly on social media and was commended by countries such as the US. In it, the Nicaraguan diplomat said he was speaking out “in the name of the 177 political prisoners and the more than 350 people who have lost their lives” since the failed 2018 uprising against Ortega and his vice-president and wife Rosario Murillo. “It’s not easy to denounce my country’s dictatorship – but to carry on in silence and defending the indefensible is impossible,” said McFields, a former journalist who is the son of the Nicaraguan poet David McFields. “I must speak out, despite the fear. I must speak out even though my future and that of my family are uncertain. I must speak out otherwise the stones themselves will speak for me,” added the ambassador, who was appointed by Ortega late last year. The public rebellion came two days after Cristiana Chamorro, the jailed opposition politician who was tipped to challenge Ortega for power in last November’s election, was sentenced to eight years in prison for what her supporters call trumped-up charges of financial crimes. Chamorro is one of scores of opposition figures who were imprisoned in the lead-up to that vote, as part of a ferocious crackdown on Ortega’s political rivals. With his foes in jail or exile, the former revolutionary hero secured another five years in power in an election the US president, Joe Biden, called an undemocratic “pantomime”. That means the the 76-year-old Sandinista, who has governed continuously since being elected in 2006, could rule the Central American country into his 80s. Ortega’s ambassador painted a bleak picture of the situation in Nicaragua under his strongman boss. “Since 2018, Nicaragua has become the only country in Central America – and probably Latin America … where there are no printed newspapers, where there isn’t the freedom to publish so much as a tweet or comment on social networks … [and] there are no human rights organizations. “One hundred and seventy thousand Nicaraguans have fled the country and others are fleeing right now as I speak,” McFields added, before insisting there was hope. “There are people, both in and outside of government, who are tired of this dictatorship and its actions.” Nicaragua’s foreign ministry claimed McFields did not represent Ortega’s government and argued his comments therefore lacked “validity”. However, only on Monday the website of one government-backed group run by one of Ortega and Murillo’s children had described him as Nicaragua’s OAS ambassador.",News/World news,Nicaragua’s ambassador to the OAS denounces Daniel Ortega’s ‘dictatorship’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/nicaragua-ambassador-oas-denounces-daniel-ortega
3/24/2022,"When Coronation Street began in December 1960, Tony Warren’s television creation instantly made its mark with distinctive, believable characters such as Ena Sharples, Elsie Tanner, Annie Walker, Albert Tatlock and Ken Barlow who portrayed life in a working-class back street in the north of England. Around them, Warren peopled the cobbles of the fictional Weatherfield with other equally authentic “residents” in one of television’s first contributions to the social-realist revolution that was already under way on stage and in the cinema. Angela Crow, who has died aged 86, joined the ITV serial for episode 12, screened in January 1961, as the 19-year-old Doreen Lostock, a machinist at Elliston’s raincoat factory in Victoria Street. The ritual of Doreen and her workmate Sheila Birtles (played by Eileen Mayers) buying their favourite lunch from Florrie Lindley’s corner shop earned them the nickname the “barm cake girls”, a term that fixed the soap in time and place. When her supervisor at work, Harold Pilkington (Philip Anthony), groped her, Doreen called him out in front of her fellow workers. He gave her a week’s notice, but she left on the spot. She subsequently worked behind the bar at the Rovers Return pub, having fallen for Billy Walker (Ken Farrington), son of the publican Annie (Doris Speed), and at Gamma Garments, a clothes shop managed by Leonard Swindley (Arthur Lowe), with Emily Nugent (Eileen Derbyshire) as senior assistant. The trio were given plenty of opportunity to perform comedy, notably when Swindley had the women modelling new stock in the shop and on television. When Doreen said “ecky thump”, which was her response to all manner of situations, sad or humorous, it came across not so much as a stereotype of northern people as an affirmation of their identity. Doreen and Sheila eventually rented the flat above the corner shop and, in jiving to the music on their transistor radios and spending their nights on the town in search of boyfriends, represented the opening up of the swinging 60s. However, in 1963, Doreen decided there was life beyond Weatherfield and left to “join the flippin’ army and see the flippin’ world”, heading for the Women’s Royal Army Corps to become a tank driver. Crow had completed 145 episodes between 1961 and 1963, with a break in the middle when those Coronation Street actors not on contract took part in a seven-month strike by Equity members. Like Doreen, Crow said she wanted to “get out there and see the world”, explaining: “I wanted to do Ibsen and Chekhov. I’d had to turn down two meaty parts in the new-wave films [and] it was an exciting time of change in the theatre.” Alongside her stage work, Crow was later in a programme fondly remembered by a whole new generation of viewers. In the BBC children’s sitcom Potter’s Picture Palace (1976-78), Crow played Joan Biddie, receptionist and usherette at a cinema being restored to its former glory by the manager, Peter Potter (Eden Phillips), who had inherited it from his aunt. Crow was born in Horsforth, which was then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, to Alice (nee Whalley) and WB (William) Crow. Her father was an author of books on the occult who became a biology lecturer at Leicester College of Technology. Crow’s acting career began when she played truant from Alderman Newton’s girls’ school, Leicester, to appear in Jane Eyre with a touring company. She then trained at Rada in London, where she won the Tree and Emile Littler awards. After graduating in 1954, she gained experience in repertory theatres. She made an early stage appearance as Maria in Twelfth Night at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre in 1956, and then her big break came with the role of Lily Smalls in the original West End production of Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood, adapted from his radio play, at the New (now Noel Coward) theatre (1956-57), which BBC television recorded for a 1957 broadcast. As well as parts in TV plays before joining Coronation Street, Crow had roles in classic serials: she was Nina Fawn in The Eustace Diamonds (1959), Charley in Bleak House (1959) and Betsy in Barnaby Rudge (1960). She also played a housemaid in The Pianist episode of the classic TV sitcom Hancock’s Half Hour in 1957. Later, she was a busy screen character actor, switching between drama and comedy. She had a regular role as Cissie Ludgrove, Irene Handl’s assistant at a hairdressing salon, in the sitcom Barney Is My Darling (1966) and played Calpurnia, the Roman emperor’s last wife, in Heil Caesar! (1973). There was also the part of Liz Stride, believed to be one of the serial killer’s victims, in Jack the Ripper (1988), a miniseries starring Michael Caine as the Scotland Yard inspector Frederick Abberline. On the West End stage, Crow was Dorothy in the writer Richard Harris’s play Stepping Out in 1986 (Duke of York’s theatre) and Rummy Mitchens in George Bernard Shaw’s Major Barbara, directed by Peter Hall (Piccadilly theatre, 1998). She also played Lizzie in Edna O’Brien’s play A Pagan Place at the Royal Court theatre (1972) and Jane, the long-suffering wife of Sidney Hopcroft, in Alan Ayckbourn’s Absurd Person Singular at the Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh (1981-82). In retirement, living in West Yorkshire, she was a keen member of the Brontë Society, gave talks about the Brontë family and wrote the book Miss Branwell’s Companion (2007). In 2005, Crow married Michael Woods. He died of cancer the following year. She is survived by her son, Jonathan, from her earlier relationship with John La Thangue.

3/24/2022,"A collection of letters by the late novelist John le Carré is to be published later this year. A Private Spy: The Letters of John le Carré 1945-2020 spans almost eight decades, from the author’s childhood in wartime Britain to just days before his death in 2020. It contains letters to le Carré’s family and friends as well as to high-profile fans such as Hugh Laurie, Ralph Fiennes, Stephen Fry, Alec Guinness and Tom Stoppard. Topics range from politics and writing to his first marriage and his relationship with his father, Ronnie Cornwell, a fraudster who spent four years in prison and was an associate of the Kray brothers in London’s criminal fraternity. Le Carré’s publisher, Viking, has called the book “the most intimate portrait of the great writer that will ever be published”. The letters have been selected and edited by le Carré’s son, journalist Tim Cornwell, who said the experience was an “enormous privilege”. He added: “My father was brave in the way that he spoke for what he believed in, brave in the places and subjects he tackled in his writing, and brave in the way he faced illness. His friendships, his obsessions and his incisive wit were no surprise, nor the sheer joy of his writing voice: I recognised the man I knew in every syllable. I hope others will enjoy the journey as much as I have, and laugh, cry, and sometimes wince with me as they read these letters and travel with my father.” Le Carré previously had a career in British intelligence, working for MI5 and MI6 during the 1950s and 1960s before turning to writing, earning critical acclaim around the world for novels such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Night Manager. He died in 2020, aged 89, and A Private Spy will mark his second book published posthumously: his novel Silverview came out last year. Mary Mount, le Carré’s editor at Penguin, said that reading the letters was “a very thrilling and moving experience”. She added: “We are back in his company once again, listening to that inimitable voice: his fiercely acute observations, his humour, his tenderness, his rage. I cannot wait for readers to enjoy this collection, marvellously edited by his son Tim, as much as I have.”  A Private Spy will be published on 3 November.",Arts/Books,‘We are back in his company’: le Carré returns in a revealing collection of private letters,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/23/we-are-back-in-his-company-le-carre-returns-in-a-revealing-collection-of-private-letters
3/24/2022,"Joe Biden is heading to Europe with the aim of keeping up pressure on Russia in the face of sanctions fatigue and splits over energy sanctions among US allies. It will also, to some extent, be a lap of honour for the US president’s success so far in keeping allies and partners together in confronting Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Biden will take part in an emergency Nato summit, a G7 summit and a meeting of the European Council on Thursday – all groups that largely welcome a return of US leadership and engagement in Europe after the nadir of the Donald Trump administration. But ratcheting up pressure on the Kremlin as the atrocities in Ukraine worsen will be far harder than the concerted measures taken so far. There are fundamental splits within the EU on whether to follow the US in imposing an embargo on energy imports from Russia, with Germany, which is heavily dependent, adamantly against. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has argued it would hurt Germany more than Russia. Previewing Biden’s trip, his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, made clear that the president was not going to push the issue, sensitive to the fact that the implications for Germany and other European states are far more severe than for the US, which imported a very small amount of Russian oil. Biden, Sullivan said, recognized “that some of our European allies and partners would not be able to follow suit and he was not going to pressure them to do so”. However, he made clear that there would be sanctions package announced on Thursday. Some of that is likely to involve the US catching up with Europe. The Wall Street Journal has reported, for example, that Biden will announce targeted measures on members of the Russian state Duma. The US could also enlarge its list of sanctioned Russian oligarchs, which is missing some of the names that are on European and British lists. Sullivan said a principal focus will be on tighter enforcement of existing measures. Part of Thursday’s announcement, he said would be “a joint effort to crack down on evasion on sanctions-busting, on any attempt by any country to help Russia basically undermine or weaken or get around the sanctions”. That may mean more details of a joint taskforce aimed at tracking down the hidden assets of the oligarchs, Putin’s circle and their extended families. Another tougher element of the European Council meeting will be an effort to forge a common front towards China, before a planned EU summit with Xi Jinping next week. Biden wants the Europeans to echo the US message that any supplies of Chinese armaments to the faltering Russian military campaign would have severe consequences for economic relations. The Nato meeting will in theory be an easier affair. On the eve of the summit, the alliance announced it will double the number of its deployed battlegroups, sending them to Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Slovakia, matching the bilateral deployments already made by the US, the UK and others to Poland and the Baltic states. The secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said there would be more announcements on the eastern flank on Thursday. Behind closed doors, the leaders will have to make plans for how to respond to a range of extreme contingencies, like the use of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons by a desperate Putin. Before boarding the Marine One helicopter on the first leg of his trip, Biden repeated his warning that chemical weapons, in particular, remain a serious threat. There will also be a discussion of Nato’s long-term plans in terms of deployments. Under a 1997 agreement with Russia, the US agreed not to deploy its troops permanently in the frontline states. Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 it has stepped up the US presence in Poland and the Baltic states, but in rotating deployments to honour the letter of that agreement. But the US and its closest allies now see that deal as worthless and the road is open to contemplate permanent basing, which the Baltic nations, in particular have been calling for. “We don’t have all the answers yet,” Julianne Smith, the US ambassador to Nato, said. “Permanent stationing could be one solution or persistent rotations is another option that could be on the table. At this point, what we need to do is have our military commanders give us the best advice they can and come to us with specific proposals.” Underpinning those discussions will be the nagging insecurity that eastern European states have over whether the US would really come to their rescue in the event of a Russian attack. Biden’s trip to Poland on Friday and Saturday will in part be intended to address that anxiety. The president and the Europeans will be meeting are acutely aware that his predecessor called US commitment to Nato into question, and that Trump could return to the presidency in 2025. Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to Nato, argued: “The alliance, and particularly the United States, must also recognize, if only sotto voce for now, how serious the credibility problem has become and the need for it to rise to the top of the long-term US and Nato foreign policy agenda.”",News/US news,Joe Biden heads to Europe in effort to keep pressure on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/joe-biden-europe-russia-ukraine-nato-g7-european-council
3/24/2022,"Brittney Griner has met with a US official for the first time since the basketball star was detained in Russia over allegations she attempted to bring cannabis into the country. US State Department spokesman Ned Price told CNN on Wednesday that an official from the American embassy in Moscow had met with Griner, who has won two Olympic gold medals with Team USA. “We were able to check on her condition, we will continue to work very closely with her legal team, with her broader network, to see to it that she is treated fairly,” Price said. “Our official found Brittney Griner to be in good condition and we will continue to do everything we can to see to that it she is treated fairly throughout this ordeal.” Without identifying Griner, the Federal Customs Service of Russia said earlier this month that a player had been detained in February after arriving at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport on a flight from New York. The 31-year-old WNBA star faces up to 10 years in prison if found guilty of bringing drugs into Russia. Griner’s arrest comes as the US places sanctions on Russia after Vladimir Putin ordered his forces to invade Ukraine last month. Some have expressed fears Griner could be used as a bargaining chip with the US as tensions over the war in Ukraine rise. Russian news agency TASS reported that Griner’s detention had been extended until 19 May in a hearing last week. A person close to the situation confirmed to the Guardian that last week’s hearing was solely about Griner’s legal team challenging her detention, and not on the merits of the case, with the hope of getting her transferred to house arrest. The court’s denial of that appeal was not unexpected, the person said. The investigation is still ongoing and a trial date will be set once it has concluded. Until then, the court extends detention by periods of time. If the investigation is not finished by the May hearing, the court will then contemplate how much longer the court needs to extend. The source also confirmed that Griner is “OK” and her Russian legal team has seen her multiple times a week over the entire course of her detention. Griner, like many of her fellow WNBA players, competes in Russia during the league’s offseason. She has played for UMMC Ekaterinburg since 2015, helping the Russian club to three domestic titles and EuroLeague Women championships in 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2021. Her annual salary of $1m with Ekaterinburg is far in excess of her earnings in the WNBA, where the maximum salary is $228,000. Griner is considered one of the best players in the world. She won gold medals with Team USA at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, the WNBA title with the Phoenix Mercury in 2014 and has been named an WNBA All-Star seven times.",Sport/Sport,US official says Brittney Griner is in ‘good condition’ in Russian jail,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/23/us-official-says-brittney-griner-is-in-good-condition-in-russian-jail
3/24/2022,"There is much about this government’s – and, to its shame, Labour’s – newfound love affair with nuclear power that makes no sense (Johnson announces aim for UK to get 25% of electricity from nuclear power, 21 March). First, you cannot just turn off a nuclear power station. If we have 25% of our electricity generated by nuclear, then on days when all our needs can be met by renewables we will have to turn off 25% of our much cheaper renewable feed while using expensive, taxpayer-subsidised nuclear generation. Second, we have no way of dealing with the mountains of dangerous high-level and intermediate-level waste that has been accruing since the 1950s. To generate more is sheer madness. Third, nuclear power stations are vulnerable to the elements and to hostile attack – cyber, terrorist, state actors etc. Recent events in the Ukraine make this very real. Fourth, the old argument about what we do when the wind isn’t blowing and the skies are overcast over the whole of the UK, which doesn’t stand up to much scrutiny now, falls away completely if we were to invest just a small amount of the taxpayer money that will go to the nuclear industry into research and development of electricity storage. Finally, given the nuclear industry’s track record of bringing in plants well over budget, decades late, the proposed programme is not going to be realised until 2060 at the earliest. Why on earth are we contemplating it?John FrenchBrockweir, Gloucestershire  Your report states that “electricity demand is expected to rise steadily in the next decade”. The same justification was used in 2006, when the Labour government first committed to further nuclear power stations. Based on the official forecasts issued in 2006, we should by now be consuming at least 15% more electricity than we were then. But we are not. UK electricity consumption has in practice gone down by more than 15% since 2006. In the interim, no new nuclear power stations have been added to the system. It hasn’t collapsed, and is far less carbon-intensive. Surely we aren’t getting fooled again by the same spurious rhetoric about endless consumption growth? In that immortal phrase of the 1970s: “Save it. You know it makes sense.”Andrew WarrenChairman, British Energy Efficiency Federation  The dash to fossil fuels is not the environmental disaster set out by António Guterres (Ukraine war threatens global heating goals, warns UN chief, 21 March). It is, at worst, the replacement of existing hydrocarbons purchased from Russia. In the longer term, it is clear that alternative renewable energy sources will displace fossil fuels and most countries will wish to do this as quickly as possible. The government’s desire, supported by Labour, for increased nuclear power generation is bizarre. A wind turbine capable of producing 15MW can be installed offshore for £10m. Sizewell C is expected to cost £20bn and produce 3.2GW of electricity – this does not include decommissioning costs. To generate 3.2GW would need 214 turbines costing £3.2bn, albeit some money would need to be spent on storage capacity. The government plans to invest £1.7bn in Sizewell C. How is spending more than five times as much on a controversial power source that takes 10 years to build a good idea?John BlanningCanterbury  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

We should begin future-proofing as far as we can. It has been clear for years that foreign ownership of UK property and land must be restricted. Any involvement by offshore trusts should be banned. These restrictions would help prevent, or limit, situations like the present one. More importantly, with a housing shortage that affects large numbers of us, such restrictions would help constrain increasingly ridiculous property prices. In 2018, as part of a policy to curb rocketing house prices, New Zealand banned the sale of homes to many foreign purchasers. Increasingly, countries in Europe and beyond are restricting foreign property and/or land ownership in the interests of their citizens. It does no favours to any of us if successive governments fail to legislate to prevent the sale of properties to those who use them as vanity projects (often unlived in), and the UK merely as a secure vault for their billions.

3/24/2022,"Coventry, which has voted to suspend its 80-year connection with Volgograd, joins at least eight other UK councils in severing twinning arrangements with Russian cities in protest at Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. But Canterbury remains twinned with Vladimir, 120 miles east of Moscow. A spokesperson for Canterbury city council stressed that the arrangement had nothing to do with the council and was the sole responsibility of the Canterbury Three Cities Association. The association – which also links the city with Bloomington and Bloomington-Normal, Illinois – issued a statement condemning Russia’s actions in Ukraine. But it added: “We believe that to sever links with Vladimir now would be a pointless gesture, of no help whatever to the beleaguered people of Ukraine.” For 36 years Glasgow had been twinned with the Russian city of Rostov-on-Don, 80 miles east of the Ukrainian border. But hours after the invasion the arrangement was suspended by the council leader, Susan Aitken. She said: “While this is a small thing in the circumstances, Glasgow must join the world in unequivocally condemning the acts of war unleashed on Ukraine by Russia.” A day after the invasion, Cheltenham suspended its twinning activities with the Black Sea resort of Sochi. A day later Manchester suspended its “friendship arrangement” with St Petersburg that had gone back to 1962. County Durham ended 54 years of links with Kostroma, 250 miles north-east of Moscow, in early March. After a week of pressure, on 4 March Oxford city council suspended its twinning with the Russian city of Perm, near the Urals. Exeter city council voted unanimously to suspend civic links with Yaroslavl, 160 miles north-east of Moscow, on 11 March. And there was similarly unanimous vote in Perth and Kinross council to end Perth being twinned with the north-western Russian city of Pskov. Last week Plymouth said it planned to end its twinning arrangement with the Black Sea port of Novorossiysk after residents of the city’s Novorossiysk Road replaced its sign with one reading “Volodymyr Zelensky Road” in tribute to the Ukrainian president.",News/UK news,Friend or foe?

3/24/2022,"There is a pattern according to which the Conservative party chooses its leaders as the antidote to their predecessor. Theresa May was the stolid answer to David Cameron’s flimsiness; Boris Johnson promised to be a daredevil where May had been dour. On that principle, Rishi Sunak had positioned himself as the candidate of sincerity and competence, Boris Johnson being the opposite of those qualities incarnate. When the prime minister looked close to being toppled during the “partygate” scandal, the chancellor’s support was tepid. Then came war in Ukraine, a geopolitical crisis to make any domestic scandal look parochial by comparison. The change in perspective was a reprieve for Johnson. Tory MPs are no longer agitating for a replacement. Sunak’s loyalty can no longer waver so conspicuously. The ambition is undiluted. Its expression was clear from a spring statement fashioned entirely around the Conservative party fetish for cutting taxes. Sunak was under pressure to abort a national insurance hike due next month, branded as a levy for health and social care. Although the original impetus for that move had come from No 10, the chancellor bought into the political gamble – taking flak for breaking a manifesto pledge in order to avert the greater electoral hazard of an NHS funding meltdown. A U-turn would blow a hole in the budget, with the added sting of making him look weak in yielding to demands from backbenchers and the opposition. Also, the received wisdom in Downing Street is that the optimal time for cutting taxes is just before an election. Voters might then carry the happy vibe straight into the polling booth. Sunak’s ideological preference for a smaller state is not in doubt. He is a devout Thatcherite but of a particular denomination – the fiscally flagellant cult that insists on discipline in borrowing, reduced deficits and tighter spending before indulging in the pleasure of the tax cut. He was keen in his speech on Wednesday to emphasise how borrowing costs have risen and how global uncertainty demands the observance of “fiscal rules with a margin of safety”. But for many Tory MPs, the optimal time for cutting taxes is always now. The chancellor didn’t want to disappoint them – and he found a solution that is more politically elegant than economically rational. The impact of the national insurance rise will be blunted by raising the threshold at which the tax is paid. Most thrillingly for Conservatives, Sunak has also booked in a 1p reduction in the basic rate of income tax for 2024. A VAT reduction on solar panels and insulation will help homeowners with enough of a disposable income to be in the market for greener energy hardware, which is not the demographic most in need of immediate help. That isn’t any consolation for people struggling with their bills right now, but not much of the spring statement was aimed further than the Tory benches. In terms of the immediate cost of living crisis, there was a 5% cut in fuel duty and an increase in the household support fund – a meagre pool of local authority grants. Meanwhile, inflation will shrivel the real value of state benefits and departmental budgets. For all the chancellor’s declared intention to throw a warm economic security blanket around the nation’s shoulders, people on the lowest incomes will be left out in the cold. The whole package expressed a rhetorical contortion. Sunak wants to satisfy the Conservative self-image as a party of low taxation. At the same time, he can’t ignore economic reality shaped by the pandemic, war in Europe and public demand for services that are not completely derelict. The overall tax burden will still be at its highest level since the late 1940s. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects real household disposable income to fall this year at the fastest rate since records began. What the chancellor advertised as an exercise in building economic resilience is really austerity by stealth, with the pain felt most by people who can least afford it. That promises a bumpy ride to the next election, albeit with comfort breaks for some Conservative target voters. The political consequences are impossible to predict. Governments do not generally get more popular by making millions of people poorer. Then again, Britain has a record of swallowing bitter economic pills dispensed by Tory governments and returning the party to power, while Labour waits in vain for the pendulum to swing. In the current crisis, Johnson and Sunak have a genuine alibi. It was Vladimir Putin who invaded Ukraine. That aggression, and the western sanctions to punish it, threaten a long war of economic attrition with a totalitarian state that doesn’t hesitate to impoverish its own citizens. Fuel is the first commodity to be affected. Grain is next. Ukraine and Russia account for around a quarter of the world’s wheat exports. A protracted war will make food scarce in some countries and more expensive everywhere. These are perils unseen by western European electorates for generations. They require a level of candour from politicians about the scale and duration of the necessary sacrifices; also, economic policies that distribute the cost fairly. Nothing in Johnson’s career suggests he can rise to that challenge. Any vestigial hope that he might do so was dashed when he compared Ukraine’s battle for survival to Britain’s decision to leave the EU. History invited the prime minister to reach for a Churchillian mode of national reconciliation, the role for which he has always imagined himself destined. Instead he chose the only way he knows: crass insensitivity and cynical division. Sunak had the chance to be different. He emerged from the pandemic poised to be the anti-Johnson; the serious alternative. But he missed the turning in the road. There is no room now for repudiation. Whether they trust each other or not, from here onwards, Boris and Rishi are a duplicitous double act; the same record, the same fate.

3/24/2022,"A prominent adviser to Vladimir Putin has resigned from the government and reportedly left Russia in the highest-ranking defection yet over the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin’s special envoy for relations with international organisations for sustainable development, was confirmed on Wednesday to have left the government. Chubais’ resignation was motivated by his “opposition to President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine”, two people familiar with the situation told Bloomberg News, which first reported the story. Chubais is now reportedly in Turkey, where the newspaper Kommersant published a photograph of a man resembling the former Kremlin official at a cashpoint. Chubais was allegedly sighted in Istanbul as early as last week. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov confirmed that Chubais had resigned from the government on Wednesday but did not say whether or not he had left the country. “Yes. Chubais has resigned voluntarily. And it is up to him whether to leave or not,” Peskov said during a daily press briefing, according to the Interfax news agency. Chubais is not a particularly influential member of the government and has no say in security affairs, but his resignation will create headlines in a country where most Russians know his name. Chubais is best known as the architect of Russia’s controversial privatisation scheme in the 1990s, which helped create the country’s market economy but also concentrated immense wealth in the hands of a group of wealthy oligarchs. A former chief of staff under Boris Yeltsin, Chubais recommended Putin for his first Kremlin position as deputy chief of the presidential staff in 1997, several years before he emerged as Yeltsin’s successor. The former economist held a number of government roles during the 2000s, including the head of the state-run Rusnano firm. He was named Putin’s climate envoy in 2020. In his years in government, Chubais established himself as a consummate political survivor, maintaining a role in Russia’s government despite his liberal credentials and the lingering anger over the pain of the Yeltsin government’s economic reforms. Yet after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began last month, he began to air signs of discontent, posting images of the slain opposition politician Boris Nemtsov and that of the liberal economist Yegor Gaidar, who had warned of the dangers of imperial ambitions under Putin. “In our arguments about Russia’s future I didn’t always agree with him,” Chubais wrote. “But it appears that Gaidar understood strategic risk better than I, and that I was wrong.” Very few current or former Kremlin officials have spoken out against the war. Arkady Dvorkovich, a former chief economic adviser to Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of the Russian security council and former president, condemned the war in an interview with Mother Jones magazine last week, saying: “Wars are the worst things one might face in life … My thoughts are with Ukrainian civilians.” He was promptly fired from his remaining government positions.",News/World news,Putin adviser Anatoly Chubais quits and leaves Russia over invasion of Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/putin-adviser-anatoly-chubais-quits-leaves-russia-invasion-ukraine
3/24/2022,"Rishi Sunak’s spring statement did not have much support for environmentally friendly policies. Although there was a reduction in VAT on items such as solar panels and heat pumps, there were also environmentally regressive policies such as reducing the cost of petrol. Here are five policies Sunak could have introduced to make his spring statement more environmentally friendly. Oil and gas companies are enjoying a bonanza from prices that were already soaring in the recovery from the Covid-19 recession, now sent even higher by the war in Ukraine. The cost of extraction is the same, so the elevated price companies are getting for their products is pure profit. Even the normally conservative International Energy Agency has recommended the measure, and Labour estimates a windfall tax could bring in £3bn that could be recycled to reduce energy bills for hard-pressed households. But the chancellor has adamantly refused. After working from home in the pandemic, many people have returned to the office in their cars instead of braving public transport, and this habit seems to be sticking. But if the UK is to meet its carbon budgets, reducing stubbornly high emissions from cars will be essential. Making public transport cheaper or even free would serve several purposes: reducing the UK’s overall fuel use, which would bring down petrol costs for those still needing their cars; reducing greenhouse gas emissions; cutting air pollution; cutting the cost of living for the poorest, who are most reliant on public transport; and encouraging people to work from offices, which the government wants them to do. The fiasco of the green homes grant – the insulation programme introduced as a “build back greener” measure during the Covid pandemic and scrapped after six months – showed that the UK does not have enough trained installers of insulation and heat pumps. Building up those skills and investing in the skills needed for other green measures, from renewable energy to building more climate-resilient infrastructure, would benefit green jobs, help with levelling up and help households out of fuel poverty. VAT has been removed from solar panels and energy efficiency materials at last, and the government is planning grants of up to £5,000 for heat pump installations under its boiler upgrade programme from April. But there is much more that could be done to improve energy efficiency in the UK’s draughty homes, such as green mortgages that enable people to add the cost of upgrades to their mortgages at low interest rates, or under loans from the UK Infrastructure Bank that charged zero interest. From creating new cycle routes and electric vehicle-charging networks in towns and cities, to tree-planting and building flood defences in rural areas, there are dozens of ways in which new infrastructure is needed to help the UK cut greenhouse gas emissions, and adapt to the impact of the climate crisis. Investment in this infrastructure would not only cut emissions but improve people’s health and wellbeing, and could create tens of thousands of new “shovel-ready” green jobs around the UK.",News/UK news,The green policies left out of Rishi Sunak’s spring statement,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/the-green-policies-left-out-of-rishi-sunaks-spring-statement
3/24/2022,"Sex can often be a disappointment – particularly for women. A recent study from the official publication of the International Academy of Sex Research shows that while gay and straight men climax about during about 85% of their sexual encounters, women having sex with women orgasm about 75% of the time, while women having sex with men come last (literally) at 63%. On a first-time hookup, the gap widens further, with 80% of men reaching orgasm compared with only 40% of women. This issue, known as the “orgasm gap” or “pleasure gap” (because orgasms aren’t always the goal) is the jumping-off point for Netflix’s new docuseries The Principles of Pleasure. In this three-parter, narrator and comedian Michelle Buteau takes viewers on an educational journey of what the pleasure gap is, why it happens, and how on earth we get past it. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers sex to be part of our overall quality of life – as the show outlines – so women having less pleasure than men means they also have a lesser quality of life. Fundamentally, this means coupled men and women – regardless of how loving they may be – are not equal in their relationships. Researchers have connected equality – pleasure and otherwise – to sexual consent and say that not having this equality means women are more likely to be coerced into unwanted sex. This feels like the first time this connection has been explained on mainstream TV, making The Principles of Pleasure feel almost revolutionary. Part of the show’s importance is in highlighting how far behind even the science on the subject is. One of the most eye-opening lessons unfolds in the first six minutes, when Dr Emily Nagoski – author of the sex-science book Come As You Are – tells us that modern sexual sciences still lack an understanding of how pleasure even works. “We do not have a basic understanding of the system we want to partake in,” she states bluntly. We are given the disappointing truth by scientists working in the field. Psychologist Dr Lori Brotto and sexual psychophysiologist Dr Nicole Prause explain how many research proposals – including Prause’s own – which could uncover a lot of missing information about female orgasms, ejaculation, arousal and dysfunction have been rejected due to male discomfort in the science community. The series peels back the curtain on a mostly hidden industry, revealing that even the scientific teams behind human discovery do not act without bias. Decades on from Sigmund Freud dismissing the clitoris and telling every woman with a sexual problem that she was “hysteric” (which, as the show tells us, comes from the Greek word for uterus), our understanding of female pleasure is still being defined by men. So while science has become much less grisly in its methods (scientists aren’t running around removing people’s clitorises any more) little has changed in terms of the sidelining of women’s pleasure. “Imagine if you could go back in time and learn about your body, about sex and how to embrace your desires without fear. How would the rest of your life be different?” the narrator asks. The other part of Principles of Pleasure’s importance is its attempt to put power in women’s hands. While appreciating that it shouldn’t be our responsibility to trial-and-error our way to good sex, the show offers genuine take-home sex education lessons we can use to teach ourselves to give, receive, invoke and enjoy pleasure, while science slowly catches up. It is refreshing to see these topics discussed so openly on screen. It’s almost liberating to see sex toy expert Dirty Lola teach us how to masturbate in ways that work for us, including what toys to try to how to use them. Nagoski’s teachings also feel hugely welcome, as she shows us how to increase our body confidence so that we can see ourselves as a more sexual person – recommending we stand in front of the mirror and compliment the things we love daily. The show also nails something critical: consent. The experts and interviewees take us through how to properly ask for and give it, without any surface-level analogies. Instead, they jump into the nitty-gritty of how early experiences of trauma warp our perceptions of sex, which can lead us to struggle with giving, turning down or receiving consent. This element of the show is especially important, as 97% of women surveyed in the UK have experienced some form of sexual harassment, including sexual assault, and 96% do not speak up. “We live in a world where women feel like they need to say ‘yes’ to everything or ‘no’ to everything and that’s not where great sex happens. Great sex requires that clarity of communication that grants everyone permission to [ask for what they need specifically],” says Nagoski, further explaining how this missing piece often results in women “consenting” to sex they don’t want. The main takeaway from Principles of Pleasure is that the biggest, most complex sexual organ is not our genitals, but our minds. That’s why oppressive structures, beliefs and policies have been able to wriggle into our psyches and directly affect our sex lives even if we don’t believe in them. It is also, however, why we’re turned on by people’s personalities and ideas. It’s why talking to our sexual partners inarguably stretches sexual potential, and why we can undo those problems with our own connectivity and creativity. From complimenting ourselves in front of a mirror to turning consent into foreplay by asking “would you like it if I did this?”, we can use our minds to make sex better, rather than treating sex as a hopeful game of button-pushing. As the narrator says in the show’s conclusion: “Next time pleasure feels too far away or too complicated to get to, pause. Try to get really quiet, because the answers are within you.”",Arts/Television & radio,The orgasm gap: can Netflix’s new sex ed show revolutionise women’s lives?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/23/the-orgasm-gap-can-netflixs-new-sex-ed-show-revolutionise-womens-lives
