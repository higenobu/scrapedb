4/27/2022,"The Mail on Sunday’s editor has rejected a meeting with the House of Commons speaker after a story that accused Angela Rayner of “distracting” Boris Johnson with her legs. Sir Lindsay Hoyle had called the newspaper’s editor, David Dillon, to a meeting after it ran the story, which has been widely condemned as sexist by MPs of all political parties and prompted discussion about misogyny in Westminster. But the Daily Mail appeared to double down on the piece, which quoted unnamed senior Tories claiming Labour’s deputy leader used her legs to “distract” the prime minister in the Commons and accused her of “a fully clothed parliamentary equivalent of Sharon Stone’s infamous scene in the 1992 film Basic Instinct”. The Mail claimed Dillon and the Mail on Sunday’s political editor Glen Owen, whose byline appeared next to the story, had rejected the Speaker’s invitation to a meeting on Wednesday “in the name of a free press”. In response to Hoyle, Dillon said journalists should “not take instruction in the House of Commons, however august they may be”, adding that the newspaper “deplores sexism and misogyny in all its forms”. The article, which Rayner said she had “begged” the Mail on Sunday not to run, has sparked outrage from parliamentarians across the political spectrum since its publication at the weekend. The Conservative MP Caroline Nokes, the chair of the women and equalities committee, wrote to Hoyle asking him to consider revoking the Commons pass of the piece’s author. However, Hoyle – who met with Rayner on Monday – suggested it would not be right to remove his pass. Speaking before the meeting was rejected, he said: “I am a staunch believer and protector of press freedom, which is why when an MP asked me to remove the pass of a sketch writer last week for something he had written, I said ‘no’. “I firmly believe in the duty of reporters to cover parliament, but I would also make a plea – nothing more – for the feelings of all MPs and their families to be considered, and the impact on their safety, when articles are written. “I would just ask that we are all a little kinder.” Rayner told ITV’s Lorraine on Tuesday that she had told the Mail on Sunday: “This is disgusting. It’s completely untrue. Please don’t run a story like that.” Conservative whips have claimed they will try to get to the bottom of which Tory MP made the comments about Rayner. In Basic Instinct, Stone plays a violent psychopathic killer, who in its best-remembered scene briefly flashes her vulva while being interrogated by a police detective played by Michael Douglas.",News/Media,Mail on Sunday editor rejects meeting with Speaker over Angela Rayner story,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/27/mail-on-sunday-editor-rejects-meeting-with-speaker-over-angela-rayner-story
4/27/2022,"The exponential increase in saltwater crocodile populations in the Northern Territory in recent decades may be partly a result of them preying on feral pigs, new research suggests. Scientists who have analysed the diets of saltwater crocodiles in the Territory believe the reptiles have shifted from marine prey to predominantly terrestrial food sources in the last 50 years – driven specifically by an abundance of feral pigs. Using stable isotope analysis of crocodile bones, which gives an indicator of longterm dietary habits, the researchers found that the carnivores feed on more land-based prey and have a less diverse diet than their historical counterparts. The research, published in the journal Biology Letters, analysed differences between the diets of 24 contemporary saltwater crocodiles caught near Darwin and 22 historical specimens caught between 1968 and 1986. The researchers measured changes in ratios of carbon and nitrogen isotopes. Hamish Campbell, a professor at Charles Darwin University and leader of the research project, said the carbon and nitrogen signatures were more depleted in the present-day crocodiles, indicating that they were feeding more on terrestrial food sources. “They’re generalist feeders but what [the analysis] showed us is that they’re adapting to localised prey sources,” he said. “We think of crocodiles as aquatic animals, but they’re obviously having quite serious implications for … feral pig ecology. “There isn’t anything else out there in the floodplain that exists at that high a nutritional value and biomass that could be supporting the crocs.” Previous research, published in 2018, found that saltwater crocodiles in Kakadu national park derive a large proportion of their nutrients from land animals. Campbell said the new study stemmed from a desire to understand the drivers behind rising crocodile numbers in recent decades. “Crocodiles have gone from a population of … probably a few thousand individuals across the top of Australia in the 1970s, to over 100,000 adults in the Northern Territory alone.” While croc populations have bounced back rapidly in the NT since the introduction of environmental protections in the 1970s, their recovery in Queensland and Western Australia has been slower. One difference is that those states don’t have the big floodplains seen in the Territory, which make ideal nesting habitats for female crocodiles, Campbell said. The scientists could not determine whether the carnivores were having an impact on feral pig populations in the territory, and plan to conduct further research into the ecological impacts of the high crocodile population. “[Feral pigs] are probably our most destructive feral animal right across Australia and we virtually have no idea what the population numbers are,” Campbell said.",News/Environment,Swine dining: crocodiles are thriving in the NT and it could be because of feral pigs,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/27/swine-dining-crocodiles-are-thriving-in-the-nt-and-it-could-be-because-of-feral-pigs
4/27/2022,"Britain’s economy will suffer an £8bn hit this year from a reduction in the size of the workforce caused by a pandemic-induced rise in ill-health, research from a thinktank has shown. A report from the Institute for Public Policy Research said a combination of long Covid, NHS disruption and an increase in mental illness meant 400,000 workers had gone “missing” since the global health crisis began. The report, published to mark the launch of the IPPR’s two-year Commission on Health and Prosperity, said the UK was paying a high price for deep health inequalities and ineffective policies that meant people were living shorter lives and faced greater barriers to staying in and getting on at work. The IPPR said the relationship between health and the economy went beyond people being off work through sickness and ill health, and was a crucial factor in the UK’s low productivity, low growth and vast regional inequalities. Two years after the start of the pandemic, the UK workforce is more than 1 million people smaller than it would have been on pre-crisis trends. The IPPR said health factors were responsible for almost half the decrease. People living in the most economically deprived parts of the country, such as Blackpool, Knowsley and Barking and Dagenham,were on average falling into poor health in their late 50s, five years earlier than the national average and 12 years sooner than people living in the healthiest place, Wokingham. Dame Sally Davies, England’s former chief medical officer and co-chair of the IPPR’s Commission on Health and Prosperity, said there had never been a more important time to put good health at the heart of society and the economy. “A fairer country is a healthier one, and a healthier country is a more prosperous one,” she said. “While the restrictions have eased, the scars of the pandemic still remain deep on the nation’s health and our economy.” Another commission member, Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester said: “One of the fundamental beliefs of the British public is that everyone should have access to good health, irrespective of their means and location. But currently we see grave inequalities in health and opportunity. Good health must be built into all the places people live across the whole country and communities must be supported to take greater control of their health and wellbeing.”",News/Business,UK will lose £8bn from Covid-induced decline in size of workforce,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/27/uk-lose-8bn-covid-decline-size-workforce-illness
4/27/2022,"Young people from low-income or minority ethnic families are the most likely to miss out on a university education if the government goes ahead with plans to restrict student loans in England, according to research. Almost one in four recent undergraduates who received free school meals (FSMs) at the age of 16 would not be able to get student loans under the government’s proposals, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has revealed. The government’s planned reforms to the student loan system in England includes blocking access to applicants who fail to achieve at least a grade 4 or C in English and maths GCSEs. But the IFS found that the policies under consultation could effectively bar a high proportion of students from the poorest families, as well as many black, Bangladeshi and Pakistani students. “A blanket minimum eligibility requirement would disproportionately impact students who haven’t had the same opportunities and support to meet the attainment threshold, and would result in a widening of socio-economic gaps in access to university,” said Laura van der Erve, an IFS senior research economist and an author of the research. The study found that about 23% of black undergraduates at English universities would have failed to qualify for student loans if the government opted to use the GCSE benchmark, along with about 13% of undergraduates from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds. But the minimum grades would have affected just 7% of white British undergraduates. The IFS said the impact would be reduced if the requirement was for school-leavers to have at least two Es at A-level or equivalents. Only 5% of current undergraduates previously on FSM would have been affected, although they would still be disproportionately affected compared with other groups. The researchers noted that while students who did not achieve the proposed minimum qualifications have lower degree results than their peers, nearly 80% still graduate and about 40% achieve a first class or upper second class degree. The IFS also found the requirements would restrict applicants to courses where graduates are in high demand by employers. Elaine Drayton, an author of the research, said the GCSE minimum grade was a “blunt tool” for cutting student numbers: “While it would remove access to student loans for entrants on low-earnings courses like creative arts and communications, it would heavily impact some subjects with strong earnings returns such as business and computer science.” The Department for Education (DfE) said the proposals were still being considered and no final decisions had been made. “Our consultation is inviting views not on how we close doors but on how we ensure that there are many routes to improve a person’s career and life opportunities – whether that is ensuring students are best prepared for university through a foundation year or helping them pursue an apprenticeship or further education,” the DfE said. Michelle Donelan, the universities minister, attempted to revive the government’s efforts to pass a bill mandating freedom of speech on campuses in England. In a speech to the conservative Policy Exchange thinktank, Donelan claimed that a “small cabal of the intolerant” was causing a growing threat to academic freedom at universities. On Monday the government moved to carry over its higher education freedom of speech bill into the next session of parliament, after the bill has been stalled at the report stage since September last year. The bill requires that universities and student unions use a code of practice on free speech, and protect free speech within the law for students, staff and visiting speakers. It also establishes a new complaints system to be administered by a new role with the Office for Students, the higher education regulator.",News/Education,IFS: England’s student loan change to hit poor and minority ethnic people harder ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/27/student-loan-change-england-hits-poor-minority-ethnic-people-harder-ifs-analysis
4/27/2022,"Pep Guardiola warned Manchester City they must be more ruthless to reach the Champions League final after edging a 4-3 thriller against Real Madrid in the semi-final first leg at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday. While Guardiola’s team will take a slender advantage to the Santiago Bernabéu for the return next Wednesday, he is conscious the tie is far from over after they spurned a series of chances having taken a 2-0 lead, with Karin Benzema scoring twice either side of a brilliant individual goal from Vinicius Júnior. Guardiola said: “Regardless of the result, if it was 2-0 or 3-0 we would still have to go to Bernabéu and play well. If we play like we did in the second half, we won’t be able to win. If we play like we did at other periods, we will. We want to be there to put on a good show, that is what I want to tell my players to do – don’t think of anything else. “When I became a footballer and a manager, when you go to the Bernabéu you have to perform as yourself or there is no option to win. You have to come through these situations to win the Champions League.” Guardiola was visibly upset during the game at his team’s profligacy. “We miss them but we create them,” he said. “We were there all the time. No complaints about the result, the performance, anything. I am so proud of the way we perform in front of the world. We did everything to win and with courage – with the ball, without the ball. “Football is football, the result is the result, but how we perform is exceptional. Nobody can say the performance was not good. We know we have to maybe raise the level to reach the final but this competition demands that. At the end maybe the chances we create we have to convert. “I want to convince my players that we won the game and heads up. We were two up but even two or three or four you have to perform. They have the ability to score three goals in 10 minutes. It is a good test for ourselves. “We played a fantastic game against an incredible team. The moments where they rise and come back into the game in the first half I think we gave them as our build-up was so nervous. Normally we are so safe and so good. Also they press really good and strong. All around the world and for Manchester City, we are so proud. But it is about reaching the final and sometimes football happens. We are going to Madrid to try to win the game.” Carlo Ancelotti stated that, if his side defend better in Spain, they will progress to the final against Liverpool or Villarreal. Guardiola smiled when asked about this. “I always agree with Carlo,” he said. Real’s head coach struck an optimistic note despite the deficit. “My feeling is we started poorly. We were too soft and we let in two goals,” the Italian said. “From there the team showed what they’ve shown in the last periods. We reacted well and were in the game. “It’s clear that we need to defend better. We were good with the ball, made chances and in end-to-end games you need to defend better. That’s really important. “It’s a defeat that leaves us alive in the Bernabéu in the second leg. We need to be better defensively and we believe we can create problems for them in the second leg.” Benzema’s two goals included a cheeky panenka-style penalty, after missing three spot-kicks earlier in the month. The France No 9 said: “I always have it in my head that if you don’t take a penalty, you will never miss a penalty. That’s mental confidence and that’s all. I have a lot of confidence in myself.”",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola urges Manchester City to be more ruthless in Real Madrid return,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/pep-guardiola-urges-manchester-city-to-be-ruthless-in-madrid
4/27/2022,"With a quarter of an hour gone at the Etihad Stadium, on a night when this entire lighted stage seemed to ripple and shudder, Phil Foden did something lovely. Haring off in pursuit of a high, lost, floated pass destined for the bleachers, Foden scampered on, feet battering the turf, calibrating angles and arc, and pulled that floated pass out of the sky like a man charming down the moon with a stick. His first touch cushioned it, his second fizzed it the through the middle of the sea of lost souls previously known as the Real Madrid defence. A muddle of flailing limbs almost bundled a third City goal into their own net. At which point this tie looked done, Real Madrid looked done, skewered, Foden in the middle of his own brilliant, decisive little patch of light. What exactly happened here? Elite football is, we’re told, a matter of fine details. This is a battle for space. Elite football is a suffocation. It tends towards perfection, towards the elimination of variables And then, it seems, there’s this. Just over an hour later on the same side of the pitch, Karim Benzema paused, walked up to the penalty spot and sent the ball once again up into that soft Manchester air, completing another gentle arc over the prone form of Ederson. Benzema’s second goal had pulled the score – let’s just get this right – back to 4-3. And in the padded seats in front of the press box the Madrid contingent leapt up and roared and punched the air, not so much celebrating as laughing, peacocking, flushed with a kind of affirmation. Yes, we are Real Madrid. This is us. This is how we do this thing. City will be happy, but also wildly frustrated to lead this game by the odd goal in seven heading to the Bernabéu next week. They might have packed this tie away in the opening hour. Instead the team that craves control went into Madrid’s place. And in the end this was a tale of moments – so, so many moments – divvied up between Foden’s early brilliance; and the craft of Benzema, the will of those regal meringues. Nothing was settled here. There is no sensible way to read a game like this, or to predict what might come in the second leg. It is simply a case of purring over the details, the beauty of those moments. Foden probably deserves to be picked out for City, if only because he can’t have played better than this on such a stage. So much for the dark arts. This was an illumination, on a night when the Etihad had felt a little underdone at kick-off, as though the magnitude of this game had snuck up on the place. City were slick and crisp early on. With two minutes gone Riyad Mahrez took a pass with that special Mahrez swizzle-touch, the touch, a snap of the underside of his boot, and simply veered in through Madrid’s entire left side. Had they never seen Mahrez play?. That is his channel. You can practically see his footprints. Mahrez looked up and curled in a training-ground pass for Kevin De Bruyne to head the ball down and into the corner. And so it went on, breathlessly. Foden made the second goal. This was startlingly bad from Madrid, the defence swished aside like the paper saloon doors of a western set. Foden is a footballer who at moments like when sniping around Fede Valverde seems to have some basic advantage in his relationship with gravity, a greater snap in those delicate feet. He fed De Bruyne, whose low cross in to Gabriel Jesus was transformed into a scalpel-like assist as David Alaba fell over. Jesus buried it. And moments later City eased this laughable imitation of Real Madrid open once again, De Bruyne, Jesus and Foden running from the halfway line three abreast like a 60-metre sprint heat. De Bruyne timed his pass out to Foden just right. The touch was good enough, the finish pulled past the far post. Still the brain reeled taking this in. With 33 minutes gone the team that should have been boxed up, packed off, trimmed and quartered was right back in this game thanks to Benzema, given just enough time and space to take Ferland Mendy’s pass and finish like a prince. Real Madrid are a terrible football team. Real Madrid are a brilliant football team. Real Madrid are a brittle gossamer thing. Real Madrid are as tough as iron. One of the main benefits of believing your own divine right of kings myth is this thing is never really over. The second half bought even more mania, more uncontrolled surges of energy. Foden scored from Fernandino’s cross then set off on an apparently endless knee slide to the corner, a man who just seems to crave this tournament, to drink in these nights like a sweet hot gust of air. Vinícius Júnior scored a wonderful, driving second for Madrid. And Madrid will be the happier going into the second leg, aware that this was a night when City, for all their incision, seemed to end up playing someone else’s game, high on that thrilling white light.",Sport/Football,Foden dazzles on big stage but defiant Real Madrid refuse to admit defeat | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/26/foden-shines-on-big-stage-but-defiant-real-madrid-keep-crazy-tie-alive
4/27/2022,"Doctors who share “misleading” information on social media could face regulatory action, according to planned new guidelines. Posts made on Twitter, Instagram and TikTok are among those that could be scrutinised by the General Medical Council (GMC) if a doctor is reported. The council is to update its Good Medical Practice guide, seen by some as a modern-day Hippocratic Oath, for the first time in almost a decade. The latest draft says that doctors must “be honest and trustworthy, make clear the limits of their knowledge [and] make reasonable checks to make sure any information given is not misleading”. It is the first proposed update to the guidance since 2013 and is being put out for consultation. The document will also make it a doctor’s duty to act if they become aware of workplace bullying, as well as discrimination and sexual harassment. “Good medical practice is the bedrock that helps guide ethical practice and supports doctors to provide the best possible care in a world of increasingly complex medicine,” said Charlie Massey, chief executive of the GMC. “This update is intended to be relevant and helpful to medical professionals, and to benefit patients, now and for years ahead. There is a lot of evidence of the damage bad workplace cultures can do to patient safety and, ultimately, to the UK’s ability to retain the healthcare professionals it needs.” Prof Neil Mortensen, president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: “Good Medical Practice provides the fundamental ethical principles that all doctors in the UK should follow in order to provide patients with the best care possible. “A lot has changed in medicine in recent years and the pandemic has exacerbated pressures on frontline medical staff. “It is therefore important to have an opportunity to reflect on the professional values, knowledge and behaviour expected of our doctors and surgeons.” He added that he was “appalled” by recent allegations of sexual harassment and abuse that some surgeons had shared on social media. “It is all of our responsibilities to ensure the medical profession is welcoming and inclusive, regardless of an individual’s background, race or gender,” he said. “This means all of us treating each other with respect and challenging any unacceptable behaviour. “We will use the updated Good Medical Practice guide, and the lessons learned by the profession in recent years, as the basis for our core standards document, Good Surgical Practice, when we review it.”",News/UK news,Doctors who ‘mislead’ on social media could soon face regulatory action,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/26/doctors-who-mislead-on-social-media-could-soon-face-regulatory-action
4/27/2022,"As season two of Noughts + Crosses (BBC One) opens, it is far away from the grim urbanity of its regular London setting. Young lovers Sephy (Masali Baduza) and Callum (Jack Rowan), a black politician’s daughter and a poor white boy, have grown up in a dystopia where black people, known as Crosses, shore up their monopoly of the country’s wealth and power with violence, while whites – AKA Noughts – are a furious, brutalised underclass. Sephy and Callum have chosen love over hate and are holed up together in the peaceful countryside. It can’t last. The pair are discovered and have to return to the city, to once again deal with the nightmare of living in a cruelly divided world. As viewers, we have our own problem to deal with: a programme that wants to be a chilling fable, a talking point, a shaming call to action, but is, sadly, none of those things, because it’s too confused in its intentions and too poorly executed. Malorie Blackman’s books – this second TV series is based roughly on the final few chapters of 2001’s Noughts + Crosses, with some of the 2004 follow-up, Knife Edge, mixed in and numerous changes made – are young adult novels. On the page, the twin protagonists are kids, 13 and 15 as the story begins, who have a simplicity of worldview and expression that is movingly at odds with the extreme horror of the events they are entangled in. Television tends to make the characters in YA dramatisations older, because the genre’s habit of placing teens in shockingly adult situations would seem inappropriate on screen in a way that it doesn’t in print. Failing to pull this transition off is what kills Noughts + Crosses as a drama. It airs late and features too much swearing, violence and politics for a young audience, while perhaps not being brutal enough for an adult saga with such a strong premise. Where it really goes wrong, though, is in the way its main characters – adults who may well make hot-headed mistakes but are certainly not children – talk: the open-hearted naivety of the books’ narrators has been replaced by a terribly stilted argot, where every line has a pained intensity that clunks against the actors’ clenched teeth. Occasionally, the script’s writerly over-extensions veer into metaphor-mixing nonsense: “As long as he’s with you,” Sephy is angrily warned when she and Callum come back to town, “he’s a target – and you are the bullet in his head!” Even Paterson Joseph, typically strong as the authoritarian prime minister Kamal Hadley, is not immune to being made to look ridiculous by the lines he is given. “Give me your update!” he barks, at the start of a scene where someone gives him an update. But the series has a bigger problem when the actors aren’t speaking, because it has succumbed to the lure of the portentous pause. When they take hold of a drama that doesn’t have enough muscle in its dialogue – Sky’s thriller The Fear Index was a severe case recently – portentous pauses can overwhelm it like a virus. Once you’ve started to notice how much time the actors in Noughts + Crosses spend staring past each other in anguished silence, you can’t stop. It’s also hard to know quite what the political message of the series is. While it is set in an alternative 21st-century Britain where the everyday fabric of life is recognisable, “Albion” is a colony – created when Europe was conquered by “Aprica” – and is thus powered by a codified racism rather than insidious institutional prejudice. The way it’s structured, meanwhile, is more like an apartheid state. The show can’t, therefore, easily be read as a warning that extrapolates from where we are now towards where we might end up. Into this already unclear picture, however, series two’s opening episode adds fleeting contemporary references that feel as if they have escaped from a more direct satire of our present-day, malfunctioning democracy: a TV host makes the Trumpian claim that the government is being undermined by a “biased media”; Callum’s mum, Meggie (Helen Baxendale), works in a food bank; the leader of the Ofa Brotherhood, a hardline black paramilitary organisation, complains that “our culture, our heritage, is under attack”, in the manner of a modern neofascist. Much of this won’t matter unduly if Noughts + Crosses can, as it did in series one, eventually arrive at a tense, stark conclusion. Last time, there was the question of whether Callum would abandon his political radicalism for the woman he loves; now he has done so, we wonder if Sephy can hold on to her man against the pull of her upbringing and the might of the regime. Readers of the books can make a guess, and this time they only have four episodes rather than six to get through before they find out. Since it is in those inbetween moments where Noughts + Crosses falls apart, that might be a blessing.",Arts/Television & radio,"Noughts + Crosses review – stilted, confused and poorly executed",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/apr/26/noughts-crosses-review-stilted-confused-and-poorly-executed
