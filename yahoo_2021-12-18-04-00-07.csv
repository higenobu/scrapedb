12/18/2021,"* Omicron five times likelier to cause reinfections    * No sign milder than Delta, but some say too early to know    * Two-dose vaccines offer little or no Omicron protection (Adds detail, reaction, quotes, context)    By Clara-Laeila Laudette    Dec 17 (Reuters) - The risk of reinfection with the Omicron coronavirus variant is more than five times higher and it has shown no sign of being milder than Delta, a study showed, as cases soar across Europe and threaten year-end festivities.    The results of the study by Imperial College London were based on UK Health Security Agency and National Health Service data on people who tested positive for COVID-19 in a PCR test in England between Nov. 29 and Dec. 11.    ""We find no evidence (for both risk of hospitalisation attendance and symptom status) of Omicron having different severity from Delta,"" the study said, although it added that data on hospitalisations remains very limited.    ""Controlling for vaccine status, age, sex, ethnicity, asymptomatic status, region and specimen date, Omicron was associated with a 5.4-fold higher risk of reinfection compared with Delta,"" the study, which was dated Dec. 16, added.    The protection afforded by past infection against reinfection with Omicron may be as low as 19%, Imperial College (ICL) said in a statement, noting that the study had not yet been peer reviewed.    The researchers found a significantly increased risk of developing a symptomatic Omicron case compared to Delta for those who were two or more weeks past their second vaccine dose, and two or more weeks past their booster dose.    The study involved AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines.    Depending on the estimates used for vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic infection from the Delta variant, this translates into vaccine effectiveness of between 0% and 20% after two doses, and between 55% and 80% after a booster dose.    ""This study provides further evidence of the very substantial extent to which Omicron can evade prior immunity given by both infection or vaccination,"" study lead Professor Neil Ferguson said in ICL's statement.    ""This level of immune evasion means that Omicron poses a major, imminent threat to public health.""    TOO EARLY?    But Dr Clive Dix, former Chair of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, said it was important not to overinterpret the data.    ""The conclusions made are based on making assumptions about Omicron where we still don't have sufficient data,"" Dr Dix said. ""For example, we have no data on the cellular immune response which is now probably driving effectiveness of vaccines.""    ""This is a crucial missing assumption in the modelling.""    Some of the conclusions are different to the data emerging from South Africa, where vaccines are holding up well against severe disease and death at present, he said.    ""There is a huge amount of uncertainty in these modelled estimates and we can only be confident about the impact of boosters against Omicron when we have another month of real-world data on hospitalisation ICU numbers and deaths,"" he said.    An earlier study by Britain's SIREN looking at reinfection risk in health workers, which was carried out before Omicron emerged, found that a first coronavirus infection offered 85% protection from a second for the following six months.    The data analysed by Imperial College was based on 333,000 cases, including 122,062 of Delta and 1,846 which were confirmed as the Omicron coronavirus variant through genome sequencing.    Imperial College's Professor Azra Ghani, who co-led the study, described it as ""essential for modelling the likely future trajectory of the Omicron wave and the potential impact of vaccination and other public health interventions.""    The new findings could accelerate the imposition of tighter restrictions across a number of European countries in a bid to stem the new variant's spread.

12/18/2021,"By Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber and Tom Balmforth MOSCOW (Reuters) -Russia said on Friday it wanted a legally binding guarantee that NATO would give up any military activity in Eastern Europe and Ukraine, part of a wish list of security guarantees it wants to negotiate with the West. Moscow for the first time laid out in detail demands that it says are essential for lowering tensions in Europe and defusing a crisis over Ukraine, which Western countries have accused Russia of sizing up for a potential invasion after building up troops near the border. Russia has denied planning an invasion. The demands contain elements - such as an effective Russian veto on future NATO membership for Ukraine https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/why-is-russias-putin-so-focused-ukraine-2021-12-15 - that the West has already ruled out. Others would imply the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe and the withdrawal of multinational NATO battalions from Poland and from the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that were once in the Soviet Union. In Washington, a senior administration official said the United States was prepared to discuss the proposals but added: ""That said, there are some things in those documents that the Russians know are unacceptable."" The official said Washington would respond some time next week with more concrete proposals on the format of any talks. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Washington would talk to its allies. ""We will not compromise the key principles on which European security is built, including that all countries have the right to decide their own future and foreign policy, free from outside interference,"" she said. NATO diplomats told Reuters that Russia cannot have a veto on further expansion of the alliance and NATO has the right to decide its own military posture. ""Russia is not a member of NATO and doesn't decide on matters related to NATO,"" Polish Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lukasz Jasina said. Ukraine's foreign ministry said Kyiv had an ""exclusive sovereign right"" to run its own foreign policy, and only it and NATO could determine the relationship between them, including the question of Ukrainian membership. It urged Moscow to re-engage with a peace process in eastern Ukraine, where some 15,000 people have been killed in a seven-year conflict between Ukrainian government troops and Russian-backed separatists. 'SMOKESCREEN' Some Western political analysts suggested Russia was knowingly presenting unrealistic demands which it knew would not be met to provide a diplomatic distraction while maintaining military pressure on Ukraine. ""Something is very wrong with this picture, the pol(itical) side appears to be a smokescreen,"" Michael Kofman, a Russia specialist at Virginia-based research organization CNA, wrote on Twitter. Sam Greene, professor of Russian politics at King's College London, said President Vladimir Putin was ""drawing a line around the post-Soviet space and planting a 'keep out' sign"". ""It's not meant to be a treaty: it's a declaration,"" he said. ""But that doesn’t necessarily mean this is a prelude to war. It’s a justification for keeping Moscow’s hair-trigger stance, in order to keep Washington and others off balance."" Presenting Moscow's demands, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Russia and the West must start from a clean sheet in rebuilding relations. ""The line pursued by the United States and NATO over recent years to aggressively escalate the security situation is absolutely unacceptable and extremely dangerous,"" he told reporters. Ryabkov said Russia was not willing to put up with the current situation any longer, and urged Washington to come up with a constructive response fast. He said Russia was ready to start talks as soon as Saturday, with Geneva a possible venue, but Russian news agency TASS quoted him as saying later that Moscow was extremely disappointed by the signals coming from Washington and NATO. TROOP BUILD-UP Moscow handed over its proposals to the United States this week as tensions rose over the Russian troop build-up near Ukraine. It says it is responding to what it sees as threats to its own security from Ukraine's increasingly close relations with NATO and aspirations to become an alliance member, even though there is no imminent prospect of Kyiv being allowed to join. The Russian proposals were set out in two documents - a draft agreement with NATO countries and a draft treaty with the United States, both published by the foreign ministry. The first, among other points, would require Russia and NATO not to deploy additional troops and weapons outside the countries where they were in May 1997 - before the accession to NATO of any of the former communist states in East Europe that for decades were dominated by Moscow. It would mean NATO abandoning any military activities in Ukraine, Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia. The treaty with the United States would prevent Moscow and Washington from deploying nuclear weapons outside their national territories. That would mean an end to NATO's so-called nuclear-sharing arrangements, where European NATO members provide aircraft capable of delivering U.S. nuclear weapons.
