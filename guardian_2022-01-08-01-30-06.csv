1/8/2022,"The UK has reported a further 178,250 Covid cases as the Omicron variant continues to fuel a wave of infections. The latest figures, which reflect infections picked up by testing, bring the UK total for the past seven days to 1,260,535, up 20% compared with the total for the week before. However, the daily figure is lower than those recorded in recent days, with 179,756 cases reported on Thursday and 194,747 on Wednesday.  The true number of infections is estimated to be substantially higher as not all infections are captured by the testing programme. The figure also does not include reinfections for most of the countries in the UK, and reflects cases by date reported rather than by specimen date. In England alone, 149,405 new cases were reported on Friday, compared with 152,306 the day before. A further 229 deaths in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported, while hospitals around the country remain under pressure. According to updated figures, there were 18,015 Covid patients in hospital in the UK on Wednesday, rising to 18,454 on Thursday. In England there were 16,163 Covid patients in hospital, a 30% increase on the Friday before, while in Scotland there were 1,323 Covid patients in hospital, a rise of 54%. New data from Public Health Scotland (PHS) based on sampling in NHS Grampian and Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHS GGC) shows the proportion of Covid-positive patients in hospitals who were admitted for another reason is now higher than when the Delta variant was dominant last year. The NHS GGC sampling, carried out over two days this month, found 43% of patients with confirmed Covid had not been hospitalised because of the virus. Based on six days sampling by NHS Grampian, which includes Aberdeen, it was 40%. In August last year when Delta was dominant, PHS data showed 32% of patients with Covid had been admitted for another medical reason. PHS said this data was useful in helping to decide whether to relax or tighten Covid controls. Opposition parties in Scotland have questioned whether the strict controls introduced by Nicola Sturgeon may be unnecessarily onerous. The PHS figures also show elderly people made up a far greater proportion of those hospitalised because of the virus, suggesting younger adults are less likely to be severely ill with Omicron. Much more detailed figures released for NHS England show 37% of Covid-positive patients in hospital on Tuesday 4 January were primarily being treated for another condition. The percentage has gradually risen as Omicron has spread: on Christmas Day the proportion stood at 31%, and on 1 December it was 26%. Experts have warned that having high numbers of patients admitted to hospital for other conditions but who also test positive for Covid puts extra pressure on services as they can require more care, can pass the virus to others and may mean non-Covid bed space is reduced so surgeries are postponed or cancelled. Since Omicron was detected for the first time in the UK on 27 November, it has spread rapidly. According to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, one in 15 people in England had Covid in the week ending 31 December, rising to one in 10 in London. For Scotland and Wales the figure was one in 20, and for Northern Ireland it was one in 25. The data also shows that the percentage of people testing positive has continued to increase across all age groups, although there are hints of a change among secondary school children and people aged 25 to 49. “This may mean that infections are no longer increasing among these age groups, but it is currently too early to suggest if this is a continuing change in trend,” the ONS said. Similarly, while infection levels have risen in all regions of England, the trend for the final few days of 2021 suggests infections may no longer be increasing. “But it is currently too early to suggest if this is a continuing change in trend,” the ONS report states.",News/World news,"UK reports 178,250 new Covid cases as weekly total tops 1.2m",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/uk-reports-new-covid-cases-weekly-total
1/8/2022,"Dozens of senior officials and legislators in Hong Kong have been sent into a 21-day quarantine after they attended a birthday party despite the government’s own pandemic warning. The embarrassing incident came as the city’s new “patriots only” legislature is scheduled to hold its first meeting next week. Concerns had been raised in recent weeks after a number of Omicron cases were identified in Hong Kong. Health officials say they cannot rule out hidden clusters in the community.  Hong Kong’s chief executive, Carrie Lam, said on Friday it was a “deep disappointment” that her bureaucrats ignored the government’s own advice on avoiding large gatherings in the middle of an Omicron outbreak. The party, held at a Spanish tapas restaurant earlier in the week, was to celebrate the 53rd birthday of Witman Hung Wai-man, a local delegate to China’s top national legislature. The well-connected politician invited a long list of the city’s political establishment, ranging from the home affairs secretary to the security chief. At least 19 members of the 90-seat legislative council, who were sworn in this week, were also among the 170 attendees. One of the lawmakers, Junius Ho, travelled to Shenzhen two days after the party and met a top Beijing official there. “I am very disappointed, because this anti-pandemic work has persisted for so long, so many of us have been working so hard to fight against the pandemic, so as principal officials of the administration, we should lead by example and refrain from taking part in private events,” Lam said on Thursday. Lam tried to distance her administration from the incident. She said the officials had failed to follow the rules by attending “clearly a private event, and not a function required by public duty”. On Friday, one of the affected officials, Au Ka-wang, the city’s immigration director, offered his apology to the public and said he had “reflected on this incident and shall be more vigilant in future”. Last year, Au was fined for breaching social distancing rules at a hotpot dinner. Critics say this incident is likely to further dent the public’s trust in Lam’s administration, which is already at a low point since the mass protests in 2019. A recent poll showed that less than a quarter of those surveyed in Hong Kong approved of the government’s performance. Days before the incident, Lam summoned top officials from Cathay Pacific airlines and said they must take responsibility for their aircrew breaching self-isolation rules even if “they may not know their employees’ every act”.

1/8/2022,"A police worker who illegally downloaded and took home thousands of images, including those showing murder victims and postmortems, has been jailed for three years. Darren Collins, a digital forensic specialist from Stafford, admitted misconduct in a public office last month after being sacked by Staffordshire police for gross misconduct.  Passing sentence at Birmingham crown court on Friday, Judge Henderson, compared the case to that of two police officers jailed last month for sharing photographs of two sisters, Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman, murdered in London in June 2020. He said although Collins’s case was overall “less serious” it was worsened by the fact “there were a very large number of events over a long period”. Collins, 56, accessed more than 3,000 images from police databases between January 2014 and December 2018 and police found more than 60 devices he used to store the images. No evidence was found to suggest the images had been shared. The court heard Collins used a “back door” method to access images of murder scenes, including a deposition site, pictures taken at postmortem examinations, and others relating to road traffic collisions. The judge said relatives of victims pictured in some of the images had been informed. “These people of course suffered dreadfully with the loss of their loved ones,” the judge said. “To discover now that you were looking [at the images] for nothing but gratuitous curiosity is a further grievous insult to them, their memory and their families. The behaviour of this defendant is utterly exceptional in my experience. This is a case which calls out for immediate custody.” After his arrest in 2019, Collins, who had worked for Staffordshire police for 18 years, said he viewed the images to further his knowledge of crime scenes and forensic science to progress his career. His defence barrister, Kelly Cyples, said Collins suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of legitimate work on investigations into child abuse. She said: “The crux of this case is that, at the time, Mr Collins certainly did not realise that what he was doing was criminal. He accepts and understands, with the benefit of hindsight, he should not have and was not permitted to look at other images beyond the parameters he had been given for his actual role. “There was no malicious intent and the images have never been shown to anyone else.” Staffordshire police, in a statement issued after Collins pleaded guilty, said a rigorous and extensive investigation had found no evidence that the images had been shared. Dep Ch Cons Emma Barnett said: “I’m very sorry for the additional distress that Collins’ actions caused to the families of the victims involved. We expect the highest levels of honesty and integrity from all of our officers and staff and anyone who falls below these standards will be held to account.”",News/UK news,Staffordshire police worker jailed for storing murder and postmortem images,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/07/staffordshire-police-worker-jailed-for-storing-and-postmortem-images
1/8/2022,"Ralf Rangnick is confident Manchester United’s players still believe in his methods after Monday’s dismal 1-0 defeat to Wolves at Old Trafford. Although the interim manager has only this loss in six games, United’s recent performances have been unconvincing, with his wish to implement a high-pressing style not in evidence. Before Aston Villa’s visit on Monday in the FA Cup third round, he was asked whether the players were still buying into his approach.  “They’re at least trying,” he said. “I’m sure they are listening and I think we showed in the last games against [Crystal] Palace, Burnley and in parts against Norwich [all wins] and Newcastle [draw] that they are trying to follow the advice I give them. We conceded less goals than before – it’s 0.6 in six games. “But still, it’s about balance, we need to find the best possible balance between offence and defence and this is still something we have to get better on.” Rangnick would not be drawn on reports of unrest after the Wolves defeat. “I can only tell you about the squad – obviously I don’t know about the atmosphere inside the club,” he said. “I can only speak about the players, locker room, coaching staff: everybody was very disappointed after the game, about the result and the performance, especially in the first half. “Now we have four days of training, yesterday, today, tomorrow, day after tomorrow before the Aston Villa game and my job, our job, is that we make sure we show a different performance against Aston Villa.” He even urged those considering their futures to fight for a place. “We have players with contracts expiring in the summer, we have maybe also one or two players who still want to leave although they are under contract. It’s about the players dealing with that situation in a professional way. Everyone has the chance to show in training they deserve the chance to play. If this is not the case, the player, together with the club and the agents, need to discuss the situation. “As far as I can tell the players have been dealing with that in a professional way. I cannot say anyone else. If I realise this is not the case I will address the players directly.”",Sport/Football,"Manchester United players still believe in my methods, insists Ralf Rangnick",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/manchester-united-players-still-believe-in-the-ralf-rangnick-way
1/8/2022,"The president of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, has promised an uncompromising crackdown on demonstrators in the country, telling security forces they should “use lethal force without warning” against protesters he called “bandits and terrorists”. As relative calm returned to the country on Friday, after several days in which internet and mobile phone networks were disabled, the human cost of the week started to become apparent.  The interior ministry said 26 protesters were killed in the clashes as well as 18 people from police and security forces. Witness reports of shootouts and casualties suggest that the real figures may be considerably higher. More than 3,800 people had been detained, the ministry said. In a televised address on Friday, Tokayev said he had personally given the order to use lethal force in recent days, and also blamed “so-called free media outlets” for helping to fan unrest. “Abroad there are calls for the two sides to hold negotiations for a peaceful resolution. What idiocy. What kind of negotiations can you have with criminals? We were dealing with armed and well-prepared bandits, both local and foreign. Bandits and terrorists, who should be destroyed. This will happen in the nearest time.” Promising the crackdown would continue, Tokayev said he had created a special inter-agency group to track down violent protesters. He claimed that “all demands made in a peaceful form have been heard”, but appeared to dismiss a large proportion of the protesters as criminals, saying “20,000 bandits” were involved in the unrest in Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest city and the centre of recent tumult. This suggested a large-scale operation could be launched to hunt down others. The protests were sparked this week by a sudden rise in fuel prices combined with long-simmering frustrations over the political and economic situation in the country. The peaceful demonstrations turned violent on Wednesday, with crowds seizing government buildings and widespread looting. Tokayev’s response included accepting the resignation of the government and announcing fixed fuel prices, but also ordering the crackdown. Earlier on Friday, government figures insisted that security forces had the situation under control across the country, including in Almaty. However, there were reports of fresh gunfire in the city, and in the town of Taldykorgan there were reports that people had attempted to storm a prison. The airport in Almaty is closed to all but military traffic until at least Sunday, and is being guarded by “peacekeeping forces” sent by Russia and other nations from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). In his address, Tokayev thanked Russia for sending the troops but said they had not taken part in any fighting. The Russian defence ministry said Russian peacekeepers were guarding key infrastructure sites. The ministry said 75 planes were used to transport troops and equipment to Kazakhstan. The force totals about 2,500 personnel, the regional alliance has said. The Kremlin said on Friday that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had discussed the situation in Kazakhstan with Tokayev in several phone calls. The Chinese president, Xi Jinping, praised Tokayev for “decisively taken strong measures at critical moments and quickly calming down the situation”. Meanwhile, the response from the west has been muted, a tacit admission that it has little sway over events in the country at a time when diplomatic attention is focused on deterring a Russian incursion into Ukraine. Tokayev has insisted there was “foreign backing” for the protests, a line he used to call for the CSTO deployment, and an accusation that has frequently been claimed by autocratic leaders in the region about largely homegrown protests. He has not provided any evidence of foreign backing so far. Some analysts suggest there could be a behind-the-scenes battle between different factions in the country’s elite. Nursultan Nazarbayev, the country’s first president who ruled from independence in 1991 until 2019 and handpicked Tokayev as his successor, has not been seen in public since the new year. Much of the anger of the past week has been directed against him, and there are rumours he may have left the country.",News/World news,Kazakhstan president vows to destroy ‘bandits and terrorists’ behind protests,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/kazakhstan-president-vows-to-destroy-bandits-and-terrorists-behind-protests
1/8/2022,"Sherlock Holmes might have balked, but the Royal Mail detectives came up trumps when they correctly delivered a letter with an address that was more like an episode of This Is Your Life than a conventional street name and postcode. Writing on Twitter, the County Antrim musician Feargal Lynn said the postal system deserved “hearty applause” for successfully delivering the letter addressed by following a brief history of his family in the area.  Describing his parents and the “Spar his ma and da used to own”, the description of Lynn also included his later move to the nearby Waterfoot and the fact he is “friends with the fella [who] runs the butchers” in the neighbouring village. Hearty applause to @RoyalMail Cushendall and Ballymena for being able to deliver this letter to me today got a much needed laugh ! … they had first name, the village where I grew up and half the postcode .. the rest is more like my life story ! #thisisyourlife pic.twitter.com/IYhZiegz58 Lynn said he laughed for about 10 minutes when he first saw the letter and that the description on the front brought back “so many memories from my youth”. The full description on the envelope reads: “Lives across the road from the Spar, his ma and da used to own it, his mother was Mary and da Joseph, moved to Waterfoot after he got married, plays guitar and used to run discos in the parochial hall and the hotel in the 80s. Friends with the fella who runs the butchers in Waterfoot too.” It is not the first time the Royal Mail has defied expectations in deciphering addresses that could, at best, be described as vague. Last year, Catrina Davies, who lives in a shed in Cornwall, was handed a letter in an envelope omitting a town, street name or postcode. The sender had simply addressed it to Katrina Davis [sic], noting that she lived in a shed “near a village 21 miles from Land’s End, as featured on BBC2 Simon Reeve Cornwall programme”. In 2010, a postie rose to the challenge when they were asked to find a couple with an address given as “somewhere near the golf course in Thetford, Norfolk”. But perhaps the most impressive feat was the delivering of a Christmas card to Paul Biggs in Longlevens, Gloucestershire, in 2015 – sent from Germany in an envelope simply marked “England”. At the time, Royal Mail said that although its “address detectives” were renowned for their investigative skills, this effort was “pretty impressive” even by their standards.",News/UK news,‘Lives across from the Spar’: bizarrely labelled letter finds way to UK address,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/07/lives-across-from-the-spar-bizarrely-labelled-letter-finds-way-uk-address-antrim
1/8/2022,"For postwar America, Sidney Poitier became something like the black Cary Grant: a strikingly handsome and well-spoken Bahamian-American actor. He was a natural film star who projected passion, yet tempered by a kind of refinement and restraint that white moviegoers found very reassuring. Poitier was graceful, manly, self-possessed, with an innate dignity and a tremendous screen presence. He also had a beautiful, melodious voice – the result of his childhood spent in the Bahamas, and then struggling early years in New York, trying to make it as an actor and privately studying the voices of mellifluous white radio announcers. He was a traditional, classical actor in many ways, following in the footsteps of Paul Robeson and Canada Lee, but eminently castable in a new generation of modern roles.  Almost all his famous movie roles are defined by race and racial difference, particularly that extraordinary trio of movies that came out in one year, 1967. In To Sir With Love, he was the visiting black teacher in swinging London who gets through to the kids by challenging them to be adults. In Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner he is the black man who wants to marry a young white woman, in an America where this was still illegal in many southern states. (This proposal causes excruciating discomfiture in his fiancee’s liberal parents, played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.) And in In the Heat of the Night he was the black homicide detective forced to assist a bigoted white cop, played by Rod Steiger. Poitier was always admired for his style and intelligence and an instinctive, classical technique. He was a class act. But as the 60s unfolded, in a new era of black power and radicalism, Poitier found himself very unfashionable, derided as a pseudo-white sellout, the safe option for a reactionary movie industry that would tolerate only this prettily spoken Uncle Tom. The black dramatist Clifford Mason wrote a New York Times article furiously denouncing Poitier, claiming that “artistical NAACPism is all that this whole period of Sidney Poitier moviemaking stands for”. This new mood, and a feeling that there were no good roles for a middle-aged black man, caused Poitier to withdraw from acting, returning to lower-key character roles in the late 80s (including, inevitably, a performance as Nelson Mandela in a TV movie opposite Michael Caine as FW de Klerk). But he became a well-regarded director, in charge of the huge commercial hit Stir Crazy, with Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. He also directed some movies featuring Bill Cosby, a professional association for whose embarrassments he can hardly be blamed now. Poitier’s breakthrough was No Way Out in 1950, a noir crime picture directed by Joseph Mankiewicz, in which he is the black hospital doctor who has to treat a white racist hoodlum (a characteristic turn from Richard Widmark). Five years later, at the ripe old age of 28, Poitier was cast as a troubled teen in Blackboard Jungle, the brow-furrowing “issue movie,” about teenage delinquency and inner-city schools – bookended later by his black teacher in To Sir With Love. It was entirely in line with his subsequent career that he provided the frisson of blackness, but was also the reliable good guy. Race was also a factor in Edge of the City (1957), in which he plays an easygoing, confident dock worker who becomes a kind of mentor figure to a troubled guy on the run from the military police (a young John Cassavetes). Poiter’s openness and smiling sympathy in this movie showed him at his very best. But it was in The Defiant Ones (1958) that he was more uninhibited, as the black prisoner shackled to Tony Curtis’s bigoted criminal, making their escape together, realising they have to work together and finally becoming friends. Then came the movie for which he became the first black man to win the best actor Oscar: Lilies of the Field (1964), a regular joe who finds himself bamboozled into doing manual labour for some expatriate German nuns, finally building their chapel, and achieving a mysterious if sentimental kind of redemption for him and them. It’s a movie with gentleness and charm – and it isn’t obviously about race. Three years later came that annus mirabilis in which his big three films came out – and then the disaffection set in. Looking back, some of Poitier’s performances do seem a bit tame, and the fact that for so long he seemed to be Hollywood’s sole black actor left him exposed. He was wounded by the Clifford Mason article and still more upset by the 1990 stage play Six Degrees of Separation by John Guare, based on the true story of a young black con man who tricked his way into the apartments and lives of rich white people by pretending to be the son of Sidney Poitier. Some critics found in this a wicked parable for the way Poitier himself had been permitted to become a house guest in the white world of American culture. There is no doubt that he could be a little over-controlling in his choice of roles. Bafflingly, he refused to play Othello – a role in which he would surely have been tremendous – because of the negative image of black people it promoted, preferring projects such as his sonorous LP recording of readings from Plato. But in the 21st century, Poitier’s achievements have been reassessed. Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner was, after all, about interracial marriage and sex – a subject from which modern Hollywood now runs a mile. Poitier tackled it with dignity and candour. If he was upscale and aspirational, so what? That was reality; he connected with something that white Hollywood rarely acknowledged: the vast swath of black America’s upwardly mobile educated class, people who would always face insidious prejudice and condescension. Poitier created a space for African American acting that made possible the careers of Laurence Fishburne, Denzel Washington, Forest Whitaker, Terrence Howard, and many more. The richness, strength and immediacy of his performances in Edge of the City, Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner? and In the Heat of the Night make him a screen pioneer and a Hollywood legend.",Arts/Film,Sidney Poitier: a natural film star who quietly pioneered a revolution,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/07/sidney-poitier-natural-film-star-remembrance-peter-bradshaw
1/8/2022,"Skateboarding in middle age can help people feel empowered and reduce the chance of mental health issues such as depression, according to a study. Dr Paul O’Connor, 46, who published the research and is a lecturer in sociology at the University of Exeter, said he wanted to look at what ageing in a subculture would be like.  “Older people talked about the profound experiences they were having and I ended up looking at skateboarding and religion,” said O’Connor, who is a skateboarder himself. “Religion didn’t really resonate with them but when it came to experiencing a sense of meaning, community, and ritual, they found that in skateboarding. “For a lot of middle-aged people, once you have responsibilities, like a mortgage and kids, it’s nice to have an identity away from that kind of stuff. The best time to skate is as an older person as you are plugged into online and skatepark communities from day one.” Five people speak about skateboarding in middle age and what it means for them. Scott and Georgie McVeigh, 43 and 42, from Caterham in Surrey, took up skateboarding together during the first Covid lockdown in March 2020, “to see if we could”. Scott, a telecoms project manager, first skated in his early teens. “They were the early Tony Hawk days, when the first big, pro model boards with good graphics and bright colours were being released,” he says. “We had a small group of skating friends, but we lost interest. It was also deemed more childish at the time, and we wanted to be more grown up.” He and Georgie returned to the sport after seeing adult lessons advertised in their local skatepark, Skaterham. “We turned up on a Wednesday evening and there were five to 10 older skaters – also called silver surfers – and it was a great experience. People needed an outlet and some support and found it in these groups during lockdown. The exercise routine got us outside every day.” Skateparks can be intimidating, says Scott, especially for an adult beginner. “You stick out like a sore thumb, so we call ourselves ‘the dawn patrol’ and go out at seven or eight in the morning when the park is empty. You need space to be able to practise at your own pace – and you don’t want to fall over in front of kids and their parents.” In the summer of 2021, Scott started coaching other skaters. “Going from zero to skateboarding almost every day, I saw the opportunity. I had good feedback from kids and parents who I’d helped, so I started a Skateboard GB qualification. You get a buzz from helping others and seeing their progression.” Six years ago, Neil Garrett, then aged 40, took up skateboarding for the first time since he was 18. “When my eldest daughter turned seven, she asked for a skateboard and I was overjoyed,” he says. “When it arrived, I took her to our local skatepark to try it out. It was easier to teach her a few basics by showing her what to do, rather than telling her, and I found out that I still had the muscle memory. It wasn’t long before I began to think, ‘maybe I should get myself a skateboard’.” Garrett’s return to skating was at times triumphant. “I once strung four tricks together on a half-pipe and was told by a youngster next to me that I was ‘really good’. But the lowlights were the inevitable slams which seemed to hurt so much more in my 40s than at 14. Some huge bruises came up, and on more than one occasion I put my back out quite seriously. “I concluded that tricks and street skating were now probably beyond me and it would be safer if I stuck to a longboard. But for a brief moment, I recaptured the feeling of achievement and the sense of freedom when I was young. Skateboarding was always a happy place, and it still is. Even if it’s strictly four wheels on the ground at all times these days.” To potential latecomers to skateboarding, Garrett advises: “Pad up. The concrete is unforgiving, especially if you’re older.” In London, Lisa Berenson started skateboarding when she turned 40, just before the pandemic started. “I had one when I was younger but it was a boys’ sport then and I didn’t fit in,” she said. Berenson, a 42-year-old copywriter, said she was inspired by seeing older women learning on Instagram and decided to give it a go again. “I was just pushing about at first but I started to take lessons and try more tricks. “It took me a long time to get over the self-conscious feeling of being a mum in her forties at the skatepark. I was sure everyone was laughing at me. But the more I got to know other skaters I realised that my age and skill level didn’t really matter.” She said she finds skating a great way to “switch off from the demands of everyday life”. “I have two kids with special needs and I’m the primary earner in our family and Covid has been tough on us all,” she said. “But when I’m skating, I’m so focused on learning a new trick and not falling that I don’t have room in my brain to worry about anything else.” “Other skaters are really supportive and motivate you to keep trying. It’s just so much fun.” “I skate for the sense of freedom,” said 58-year-old Jon Holden from Bath who started when he was younger “back in the days of the Z-boys [a group of American skateboarders from the mid-70s called the Zephyr competition team] ”. Holden, who is self-employed doing modelling work and making wooden surfboards, said he takes more “cruises” now rather than skating in bowls and pools. “When you get older, you get heavier and falling gets harder on the body,” he said. “Like surfing, the speed and flow is addictive and it helps me keep in touch with my core spirit. Skating for me is celebrating freedom, the feeling, the flow and the philosophy. It just makes you want to smile and definitely helps with balance.” For anyone thinking of taking up skateboarding, Holden suggested “taking your time”. “Definitely wear a helmet and pads to start out and be patient. If possible, find somewhere clear with plenty of smooth surface, and most of all, celebrate the feeling of freedom that it brings.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Skateboarding in middle age: ‘It helps me switch off’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/07/skateboarding-in-middle-age-it-helps-me-switch-off
1/8/2022,"Serb politicians and celebrities have described the treatment of Novak Djokovic as shameful scapegoating, as the foreign ministry in Belgrade suggested the world tennis No 1 had been “lured to Australia … to be humiliated.” The 34-year-old champion, who was born in the Serb capital, is in detention in an immigration hotel in Melbourne pending a legal challenge to Australia’s decision on Wednesday to cancel a visa allowing him to play in the Australian Open.  In an op ed for the news portal Iskra, reprinted by the pro-government tabloid Informer, the acclaimed Serbian film-maker Emir Kusturica argued Djokovic’s detention was “not just a lesson to the noble Serb”, but to everyone. Kusturica said the “arrest of Novak Djokovic, first among the free, a rebel who does not want the chains of the new world and believes in a more just order” recalled the plot of a movie in which prominent citizens were arrested as a lesson to the rest. Australian officials have said the player, who has refused to reveal his Covid vaccination status but previously said he was opposed to vaccination, was refused entry because he failed to meet exemption requirements. They have also said the player is free to leave the country whenever he chooses. “Hasn’t the world already become a prison of which barbed wire is the most expressive symbol?” Kusturica asked. “Aren’t the punishments for those who refuse to be jabbed just another step by the world government?” The president of the Serbian parliament, Ivica Dačić, a former prime minister whose Socialist party of Serbia is a partner in the country’s coalition government, said Djokovic was enduring “despicable political harassment”. Any country in the world “would gladly give citizenship to Mr Djokovic, let alone let him visit for a tournament”, Dacic Dačić said, calling Australia’s behaviour “shameful” and the result of “political instability in that country since elections are approaching”. The player’s family, who on Thursday compared him to Jesus and accused Australian authorities of “trying to crucify him”, called for a mass protest against his continuing detention on Friday, when Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas. “The family of Novak Djokovic calls on all fans and supporters of the best tennis player in the world, who is in a delicate situation, in front of the Belgrade city assembly,” the family said in a joint statement. “The biggest Christian holiday is an opportunity to show the significance of the community, to send support from Belgrade, and to show how much support the best tennis player in the world has in its own country.” The foreign ministry said in a statement that the Serbian public “has a strong impression that Djokovic is a victim of a political game against his will, and that he was lured to travel to Australia in order to be humiliated”. It added: “Novak Djokovic is not a criminal, terrorist or illegal migrant, but he was treated that way by the Australian authorities, which is causing understandable indignation of his fans and citizens of Serbia.” The Serbian government sent a formal protest note to its embassy in Canberra for transmission to the Australian government, and the foreign minister Nemanja Starović delivered a verbal protest to Australia’s ambassador to Serbia, Daniel Emery. The foreign ministry said Serbia did not want to influence the upcoming court decision but expected “the authorities of the country, in the spirit of good bilateral relations, to allow Djokovic to spend (time) in better accommodation”. Djokovic’s wife, Jelena, posted a photo of the couple embracing on a beach to mark Orthodox Christmas, saying: “The only law that we should all respect across every single border is love and respect for another human being.” Milivoje Pantovic is a producer with N1 Television in Belgrade.",News/World news,"Novak Djokovic ‘lured to Australia to be humiliated’, says Serbia",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/07/novak-djokovic-lured-to-australia-to-be-humiliated-says-serbia
1/8/2022,"Rafael Benítez has accused Lucas Digne of prioritising his own interests above those of the Everton team after confirming the France international wants to leave. Digne has not featured for Everton since the derby defeat by Liverpool on 1 December and was left on the bench while Séamus Coleman deputised at left wing-back in Sunday’s damaging 3-2 loss to Brighton. The 28-year-old has attracted interest from Newcastle and Chelsea in this window, among others, although Benítez insists Everton, who have signed Ukraine international left back Vitaliy Mykolenko, have not received a firm offer.  Tensions between the Everton manager and Digne have been clear for some time, with the defender withdrawing through illness from a depleted squad that drew against Chelsea. Benítez went public with his frustrations on Friday when revealing Digne’s desire to leave Everton. The Everton manager said: “It was very clear. I want to ask a question to every fan or former player. What would Peter Reid say to a player who doesn’t want to be there? It is simple. I had a couple of conversations with him, he told me what he thought. So what do you expect a manager to do when a player is thinking about leaving?” Benítez did not give an explanation for why Digne wants to leave after three and a half years but claimed the player was more interested in his personal statistics than helping the team through a difficult period. “We are professionals,” Benítez said. “We are paid big money to do our job and if someone is happy or not happy it is up to you to perform in your job. They pay you big money to perform. You have to perform, you have to be available, you have to put your interests behind the interests of the club. Maybe the stats and priorities have changed and people think themselves ahead of other things. “The team finished 10th last season and someone who is worried about their stats changes nothing for me. I don’t want to finish 10th. I’d like to be in a much better position; I am not stupid – I want to finish as high as possible. The club is growing and improving and we are creating a winning mentality for the future but it will take some time. “In the meantime you need players who really want to be here … We have to consider what we want to do in our future. Do we want to try and improve or just manage the egos and leave the team behind depending on the egos?” Benítez made frequent references to Reid and said they were not a criticism of the club legend but an example of the winning mentality that needs rebuilding at Everton. He said: “When I was talking about Peter Reid, I was talking about someone who cares, who was always pushing for the best from everyone on the pitch. That was the idea. So when I talk about that I am talking about myself also wanting everything from the players. When they do not do that, I can be upset.”",Sport/Football,Digne accused by Benítez of putting own interests above Everton’s,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/digne-accused-by-benitez-of-putting-own-interests-above-evertons
