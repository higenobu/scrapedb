4/7/2022,"The US and Europe are responsible for the vast majority of global ecological damage caused by the overuse of natural resources, according to a groundbreaking study. The paper is the first to analyse and assign responsibility for the ecological damage caused by 160 countries over the last half century. It finds that the US is the biggest culprit, accounting for 27% of the world’s excess material use, followed by the EU (25%), which included the UK during the analysis period. Other rich countries such as Australia, Canada, Japan and Saudi Arabia were collectively responsible for 22%. While China overshot its sustainability limit to claim 15% of resource overuse, the poorer countries of the global south were en masse responsible for just 8%, the analysis found. “High-income nations are the primary drivers of global ecological breakdown and they need to urgently reduce their resource use to fair and sustainable levels,” it says. Because of the ecological debt they owe the rest of the world, “these nations need to take the lead in making radical reductions in their resource use to avoid further degradation, which will likely require transformative post-growth and degrowth approaches,” the study published in the journal Lancet Planetary Health adds. Its lead author, Prof Jason Hickel of the the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology (ICTA-UAB) in Barcelona, said the findings were dramatic and disturbing. “We were all shocked by the sheer scale of the high-income nations’ contribution to excess resource use,” he told the Guardian. “We didn’t expect it to be so high. If they are now to achieve sustainable levels, they need to reduce their resource use by about 70% on average from existing levels.” The evidence suggested that this would require rich countries such as the UK and US “to stop focusing on GDP growth as a primary objective and organise their economies instead around supporting human wellbeing and reducing inequality”, he said. Hickel and the paper’s other authors distributed fair shares of globally sustainable levels of resource use to countries based on population size. They then subtracted these shares from the countries’ actual resource use to determine ecological overshoots in the 1970–2017 period. Australia led the world in tonnes of overshoot per capita with 29.16, closely followed by Canada on 25.82 and then the US on 23.45. The research analysed domestic extraction as well as the materials involved in global trade flows for resources such as fossil fuels, timber, metals, minerals and biomass, using data from the UN’s international resource panel and extrapolated calculations. Janez Potočnik, the co-chair of the UN panel and a former EU environment commissioner, described the study’s conclusions as “logical and correct”. “High-income countries are the ones really overshooting planetary boundaries,” he said. “They have set the rules of the economic game and the [global] standards and they have to show they are able and ready to lead the way back to sustainability.” The economist Kate Raworth, a senior associate at Oxford University’s Environmental Change Institute, said: “A new era in global accountability is opening up, thanks to powerful analyses like this one. New metrics such as these bring powerful new ethical clarity to longstanding injustices between the global north and global south. The undeniable responsibility of the world’s richest nations for destroying the life-support systems of our planetary home must now be turned into meaningful reparations for those worst affected.” About 44% of the planet’s nearly 2.5tn tonnes of extracted materials were used by countries that had exceeded their fair share of resource use, the new study said. Over the same period, 58 countries including India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria and Bangladesh stayed within their sustainability limits. With a combined population of 3.6 billion people, these nations collectively represent a majority of the world’s population. Degrowth strategies could improve people’s lives if they obliged producers to end practices such as built-in obsolescence, expanded public transit and incentivised repair, recycle and reuse, Hickel said. Earlier this year, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s sixth assessment on climate adaptation cited Hickel and others to contend that such strategies offered “sufficient social transformation to guarantee maintenance and [a] rise in wellbeing coupled with reduced ‘footprints’”. Another of the report’s authors, Dr Andrew Fanning of the University of Leeds, stressed that “not all people in wealthy nations are equally responsible for ecological breakdown. Besides reducing inequality between countries, reducing our growth dependence also means reducing inequalities of lived experience within them.” The IPCC’s last report earlier this week said that degrowth pathways may be “crucial” for combining social progress with technically feasible mitigation strategies. Dr Gemma Cranston, the business and nature director at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership, said the degrowth idea had potential but would “require a paradigm shift from the corporate sector and an active transformation of consumption [patterns]”. “Countries and businesses alike need to go beyond simply reducing our impact and instead follow approaches that are regenerative and restorative,” she said.",News/Environment," US and Europe behind vast majority of global ecological damage, says study",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/us-europe-behind-vast-majority-global-ecological-damage-study
4/7/2022,"The 2022 Masters sees significant changes to two holes. The par-four 11th is now 15 yards longer (is 520, was 505); and the par-five 15th is now 20 yards longer (is 550, was 530). Here Rory McIlroy and Tommy Fleetwood give their pre-tournament verdict on the changes. It’s a longer hole, but the tee shot is slightly less daunting. You don’t have that collection of trees on the right-hand side. I’d say from the widest point of the left part of the fairway to the widest point of the right is 50 yards, 60 yards. It’s a very, very wide fairway. But if you go down that right half, you’re going to be stuck behind those three trees. It’s a more generous tee shot. It was always an awkward tee shot. You had to hug that right side, and then if you just got it slightly right, you were in those trees. And you had to be very fortunate to have a shot to the green unless you blew it way right into that sort of alleyway where people walk. The second shot is basically the same. You’re maybe going to have 15 or 20 more yards into the green, but the penalty for missing the second shot is greater than it was before. You’ve got that runoff on the right. If you get to, say, pin high with the middle of the green, that drop-off on the right side is significantly deeper than it used to be. So, the miss really now is short right, sort of front edge, level with front edge of the green and just a little right, but that brings those mounds into play. Then what people probably don’t realise is that pond on the left has been extended another 10 yards back towards the tee. So that pond used to start at the front of the green. That pond now starts 10 yards before the green. So the penalty for missing that second shot is much greater. It’s a more difficult hole than it used to be. It certainly makes you think now. Even if you hit a good drive, it’s not an immediate yes, I’m going to go for it. I hit a good drive down there on Monday, it was a little bit into the breeze and I had 267 [yards to the] flag. That’s a normal three-wood for me, and the firmness that the greens are at, I’m landing on that green and it’s tough to stop it. It’s going to go through 15, 20 yards long, and it’s a tough shot from back there. It’s really a juggling act and an evaluation of whether it’s easier to hit a 100-yard pitch shot into a green that’s sloping slightly against you than it is a 20-yard through the back with it running away from you towards the water. It certainly makes you think.",Sport/Sport,‘It’s more difficult’: McIlroy and Fleetwood on Augusta’s big changes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/06/mcilroy-and-fleetwood-augusta-changes-masters-golf
4/7/2022,"Cedar Grove cemetery is across the city from the Augusta National, the other side of two sets of railway tracks in a part the traffic doesn’t stop and the tourists don’t pass. The plot was set the aside in 1820 as a place to bury slaves in shallow, unmarked, graves. Over time it turned into the black cemetery, the city’s first black principal is buried there, the first black dentist, the first black member of the local legislature. “Because there is no definitive book on African-American history Cedar Grove is the bastion of our cultural heritage,” said local historian Joyce Law when the cemetery marked its bicentennial, “this is where the stories are.” The cemetery is a little broken, cracked and tumbledown now, overgrown with chickweed, but there are some well tended corners in there too. Like the patch set aside for Willie Peterson Jr. He worked as a caddie at Augusta National and carried Jack Nicklaus’s bag for five of his six Masters wins in 1963, ’65, ’66, ’72 and ’75. Peterson died of lung cancer in 1999. For 20 years, his remains were in an unmarked grave. When Nicklaus found out about it through the golf writer Ward Clayton, he paid for a new headstone himself. The stone lists their achievements together and has an engraving of Peterson in his caddie’s outfit. It’s not just Peterson. A similar thing happened with Arnold Palmer’s old caddie, Nathaniel “Iron Man” Avery, who was on the bag for each of his four wins in 1958, ’60, ’62, and ’64. Avory died in 1985, and is buried over in Southview Cemetery, but only got a headstone in 2019 with help, this time, from the Palmer Foundation. Augusta National has stories too, just like Cedar Grove. At the Champions’ Dinner on Tuesday night, Hideki Matsuyama will have heard some of them for the first time. Eventually, as he keeps coming back here over the years, they’ll become as familiar to him as they already are to some of the other people at the table, who have heard them told five, 15 or 50 times already. If you’ve been following the Masters long enough you’ll likely know some of them yourself. The stories from the days when the club insisted that players had to use one of their local caddies are part of the lore of the place, like how Willie “Cemetery” Perteet got his nickname when he was nearly killed in a knife fight after he was caught sleeping with another man’s girlfriend. And how Walter “Cricket” Pritchett tried to hide from the cameras when he was carrying the bag for Charles Coody in 1971 because he had told his boss at his day job that he was taking the week off work to visit his sick grandmother in Houston. They’re good stories, apparently some of them are even true, but the punchline is usually to do with the caddies playing rude mechanicals. What they were, most of them, was poor kids from the Sand Hill district which is the other side of the fence from Augusta Country Club. There was nowhere in the city they could play golf. But they could work as caddies there, on the other side of the fence and, when they had learned the rudiments of how to do it, would move on to a job at Augusta National. “My mum and dad were working at King Mill at the time, and they were only making 15 or 20 dollars a week,” said Jerry Beard, who caddied for Fuzzy Zoeller when he won here in 1979, in a short film produced by the Lucy Craft Laney Museum of Black History, “get a good bag at Augusta National and you might make 20 dollars that day.” Some of them, such as Jim Dent, took what they learned there as caddies and used it to build a career in professional golf. Dent turned pro in 1966, and ended up winning 12 events on the senior PGA Tour. And some ended up in unmarked graves. Which isn’t how history works for everyone else who has been part of the Masters. The past’s ever present up there at the club, where they have the Hogan Bridge, the Nelson Bridge and the Sarazen Bridge, a Jack Nicklaus plaque, an Arnold Palmer plaque, Eisenhower’s pond and cabin, the table they made out of his oak tree after it fell down, and a trademark on the phrase A Tradition Unlike Any Other. The media eat in a canteen artfully designed to resemble the original Quonset press hut they built in the 1950s, with a wall of framed and mounted photos showing the presidents of the Golf Writers’ Association of America. Nicklaus’s decision to pay for a permanent marker for Willie Peterson Jr feels like it’s part of an overdue reckoning with this piece of its history, an attempt to mark it with something more than just another retelling of the old stories. It sits alongside the club’s decision to finally honour their first black player, Lee Elder, by inviting him to be an honorary starter at last year’s tournament. They did that just in time. Elder died seven months later. This year that third place on the first tee on Thursday morning has been taken by Tom Watson, who has his own role in this story, too. Watson was instrumental in Augusta National’s decision to finally allow players to use their own caddies in 1983. There are plans for the city to put up a permanent monument in Sand Hills, outside the club’s boundaries, “the caddies and the cooks, the chauffeurs, the groundskeepers all came from this neighborhood,” said Law, “so to have them honoured and known individually is very important.”",Sport/Sport,Augusta’s black caddies finally getting recognition beyond the old stories | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/06/augustas-black-caddies-finally-getting-recognition-beyond-the-old-stories
4/7/2022,"The US has disrupted a global “botnet” controlled by Russia’s military intelligence agency, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced on Wednesday. A botnet is a network of hijacked computers used to carry out cyberattacks. “The Russian government has recently used similar infrastructure to attack Ukrainian targets,” Garland told reporters at the justice department. “Fortunately, we were able to disrupt this botnet before it could be used. Thanks to our close work with international partners, we were able to detect the infection of thousands of network hardware devices. “We were then able to disable the GRU’s [the military intelligence agency] control over those devices before the botnet could be weaponised.” The attorney general also announced charges against Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev for sanctions violations. He said the billionaire had been previously identified as a source of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea and providing support for the so-called Donetsk People’s Republic in eastern Ukraine. “After being sanctioned by the United States, Malofeyev attempted to evade the sanctions by using co-conspirators to surreptitiously acquire and run media outlets across Europe,” Garland said. The indictment is the first of a Russian oligarch in the US since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a related move, a federal court in the southern district of New York unsealed a criminal indictment against TV producer John Hanick, 71, a US citizen charged with violations of sanctions and false statements because of his work for Malofeyev over several years. Matthew Olsen, assistant attorney general of the justice department’s national security division, said: “The defendant Hanick knowingly chose to help Malofeyev spread his destabilizing messages by establishing, or attempting to establish, TV networks in Russia, Bulgaria and Greece, in violation of those sanctions.” Last month Garland, who is America’s top law enforcement official, announced the launch of Task Force KleptoCapture, an interagency law enforcement task force dedicated to enforcing the sweeping sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. He vowed on Wednesday: “Our message to those who continue to enable the Russian regime through their criminal conduct is this: it does not matter how far you sail your yacht, it does not matter how well you conceal your assets, it does not matter how cleverly you write your malware or hide your online activity. “The justice department will use every available tool to find you, disrupt your plots and hold you accountable.” Garland, whose grandparents fled antisemitism at the border of western Russia and eastern Europe more than a century ago, acknowledged horrific images that emerged from Bucha in Ukraine his week. “We have seen the dead bodies of civilians, some with bound hands, scattered in the streets. We have seen the mass graves. We have seen the bombed hospital, theatre and residential apartment buildings. “The world sees what is happening in Ukraine. The justice department sees what is happening in Ukraine. This department has a long history of helping to hold accountable those who perpetrate war crimes.” He noted that one of his predecessors, Attorney General Robert Jackson, later served as a chief American prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials after the second world war. “Today, we are assisting international efforts to identify and hold accountable those responsible for atrocities in Ukraine and we will continue to do so.”",News/US news,"US disrupts global ‘botnet’ that Russia intended to launch, DoJ announces",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/06/us-disrupts-russian-global-botnet-doj
4/7/2022,"Maybe a little unexpectedly, Amazon Studios have given us a very watchable and classily upscale espionage drama-thriller in the spirit of John le Carré. Danish film-maker Janus Metz Pedersen directs and Olen Steinhauer adapts his own much-admired spy novella, centred on two former lovers in the cloak and dagger business who meet for dinner in a chi-chi Californian restaurant. The story is in fact inspired by a BBC TV drama that had nothing to do with spies: The Song of Lunch starring Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman. Henry Pelham (Chris Pine) is a CIA officer haunted by a disastrous event eight years earlier, when he was at the Vienna station: a plane hijacking ended in a hundred deaths because the terrorists were somehow able to anticipate the authorities’ counter-attack. And he is still heartbroken because his CIA colleague Celia Harrison (Thandiwe Newton), with whom he was and is deeply in love, broke up with him just afterwards, abandoned the service and is now a placidly contented wife and mother in Carmel, California. Now Henry’s hardbitten station chief Vic Wallinger (Laurence Fishburne) tells him there is evidence they had a mole – and Henry is now tasked with the emotionally painful duty of reopening the wounds and interviewing the suspects, including the shifty and evasive operative Bill (Jonathan Pryce) who is these days in semi-retirement, muttering resentfully into his whisky in a London pub. But Henry also has to travel to Carmel to ask Celia out to a restaurant to interrogate her over dinner. And Vic doesn’t want loose ends or official inquiries: if Celia’s answers are unsatisfactory, Henry has Vic’s authority to terminate her with extreme prejudice. The result is a complex confrontation over an Instagram-perfect meal with dizzying flashbacks to Vienna and flashbacks within flashbacks to Henry’s service in Moscow 12 years before that. It is the classic Le Carré conflation of three different sorts of betrayal: personal, professional and patriotic. Pine and Newton handle this choreography with maturity and style; Newton particularly shows how impressive she is with the right role.

4/7/2022,"Trade unions have condemned the owner of struggling Manchester airport for inflating bosses’ pay by almost a quarter in the first year of the pandemic even as the wages for staff were cut and hundreds of workers were let go. The north-west hub has been hit by weeks of travel disruption and hours-long queues for passengers, leading to the unscheduled departure of the airport’s managing director Karen Smart, who stepped down on Tuesday. However, the annual report of Manchester Airports Group, which also owns London Stansted and East Midlands airports, showed pay for the group’s managers rose by £2.8m to £12.2m in the year ending 31 March 2021 – the first 12 months of Covid when air travel slumped. This represents an increase of 23% compared with a year earlier. Meanwhile, the highest-paid director at MAG – understood to be its chief executive, Charlie Cornish – was awarded an extra £500,000, a rise of 25% taking his total renumeration to £2.5m. Aviation was one of the sectors hardest hit by Covid, and MAG said passenger numbers across its three airports fell by as much as 90% between April and August 2020. Since the lifting of almost all coronavirus travel restrictions this year passenger numbers have begun to rebound, and last weekend the start of the Easter break was marred by waits of up to eight hours as airports and airlines across the country struggled to cope with staff shortages caused by Covid infections and layoffs. However, Manchester appears to have been less prepared than most rival airports for the reopening of travel, having suffered problems for a few weeks. In a fight to cut costs during Covid, MAG embarked on a programme of mass redundancies, and held discussions with unions over its plans to cut 900 jobs. It asked all of its employees to accept a year-long 10% pay cut, while the company also paused all investment and non-essential spending. But the annual report showed directors actually received more pay and bonuses than they had a year earlier. The general secretary of the union Unite, Sharon Graham, said: “It’s the same old story: while destroying hundreds of jobs and cutting the wages of remaining staff by 10%, Manchester airport’s fat cats were awarding themselves massive pay rises.” As Covid travel restrictions began to ease in January this year, MAG announced it was looking to recruit 1,000 people to fill roles ranging from security officers, customer service officers and car park staff to hospitality and lounge workers, ahead of an expected return of air travel. However, recruitment has proved harder than airports might have anticipated, as labour shortages across the wider economy mean workers are in demand and can secure big incentives for joining certain professions, such as HGV driving. Airports also have to put new recruits through rigorous security vetting procedures. Unions have said some workers may not be willing to return to airport work, which includes unsociable hours compared with alternative roles that have similar rates of pay. “Manchester airport’s leadership has destroyed livelihoods and savaged wages, leaving the travel plans of thousands in tatters,” said Graham, calling on MAG to reverse the wage cuts for ordinary staff. “The result is a chronically understaffed airport thrown into bedlam because of the greed of a few top executives.” The travel disruption of last weekend has shown no sign of abating, with airlines continuing to announce further flight cancellations because of staff absences. On Wednesday, British Airways cancelled 78 flights scheduled to take off from or land at Heathrow, while easyJet cancelled at least 30 flights at Gatwick. A spokesperson for MAG said all its directors also took a 10% reduction in salary as part of business measures enacted during Covid restrictions, which was agreed with trade unions. “The annual report also reflects bonuses paid to all colleagues, based on the performance of the business in the financial year ending March 2020. MAG performed strongly in the year leading up to the pandemic,” the spokesperson said. They said the annual report figures also included bonuses granted under long-term incentive schemes and termination payments to directors who had left, and added that the company had been required to report the salaries of a larger number of executives than previously.",News/Business,Outrage over huge pay rises for Manchester Airports Group bosses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/06/outrage-over-huge-pay-rises-for-manchester-airports-group-bosses
4/7/2022,"It’s an extremely peculiar situation, if you come at it cold: neither the Labour leader, nor any of his shadow cabinet, can get through a broadcast interview without being asked who has a penis and who has a vagina. Why, at this moment of both national and international crisis, has the media decided that the most important question for a party that hasn’t been in government for 12 years, is a hypothetical one about genitals? It’s not really about vaginas, it’s a quest for the “gotcha” moment, the inescapable trap of deliberately twisted logic which merits unpicking. The question stems from the debate around the 2018 government consultation on whether the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) should have been reformed. Under the 2010 Equalities Act, anyone who wants to live in their chosen gender – regardless of whether they have undergone surgery – is able to do so. But, for those who want their chosen gender on their birth certificate, they have to apply for a gender recognition certificate. The reform would have allowed trans people to self-identify rather than go through a medical panel in order to receive a diagnosis of “gender dysphoria”. The issue is clearly one of equity. The bureaucratic process involves a lot of medical assessments, which can take years, unless you’re able to pay for them privately. It boils down to “trans rights as long as you’re rich”, much as reproductive rights did pre-1967. Accessing abortions was never a problem for those with money; but if you believed in it as a right, you kept on fighting until everybody had it, and progressive opinion has always been pretty clear on this point. Labour’s position has not changed since 2019 – it supports both the reform of the GRA and single-sex spaces. This is the next battleground for gender-critical feminists, who would like to see the party drop its support for reform, on the basis that any such move allows for more trans people – generally cast by some as predatory men – to access single sex spaces. When faced with the question of what defines a man or a woman, Labour is not only being implicitly asked to row back on its own policy, but also to backtrack on current legislation which says that trans men are men and trans women are women, regardless of whether they have undergone medical treatments. As things stand now, the government has blocked reforms to the GRA and the Equalities and Human Rights Commission has provided guidelines extending the circumstances under which trans people can be excluded from single-sex spaces. “Legitimate justifications” now include female-only fitness classes and the toilets of places of worship where it may offend people, on religious grounds, to have inclusive spaces. I can’t even wrap my head around the person who doesn’t want anybody trans in their aerobics class, nor in my years writing a fitness column have I ever seen “female-only” as a spec. This is a hokey, made-up scenario. Those crop up a lot. And let’s not rehash where faith as a caveat to equality meets its hard limit. The Labour frontbench needs to own its policy on the GRA, and take the fight back to gender-critical feminists – did they expect Labour to resile from a position based on human rights and equality? Nobody knows all this better than a human rights lawyer, and this can all read like a bespoke trap for Keir Starmer, forcing him to choose between what he knows is right, just and legally defensible, and what he thinks, as per elaborate focus grouping, will play better on Good Morning Britain. In fact, though, it’s a classic wedge issue for the entire party, filleting it effortlessly into left and right to bring it to a point where it cannot stand itself. The Labour right is happy to throw the entire issue under the bus for that elusive quality of “electability”, which only the right is allowed to define, yet which it never seems able to turn into victory. Wes Streeting, who appears to be running a shadow-shadow operation in preparation for his own leadership bid, told Julia Hartley-Brewer “men have penises, women have vaginas, here ends my biology lesson”, rather than citing the law. This is despite his previous support for trans people. The left, meanwhile, ties itself in knots trying to recognise trans rights without actually fighting for them or finding any passion or joy in being an ally. Anneliese Dodds was so squirrelly, answering a question about what defined a woman, that it was genuinely hard to work out whether she was on anyone’s side. The person who’s laughing all the way to the ballot box is Boris Johnson, using feminists instrumentally when he doesn’t care about feminism, attacking trans people strategically to harm his opponents (despite a member of his own party coming out as trans last week), when I doubt he cares about the issue at all. Labour needs to take a stand based on principles of equality with which they are familiar. They could also maybe learn from their history of being wedged – on Brexit, and long before that, on nuclear disarmament – by political enemies who care much less about the issue than they enjoy watching Labour fall apart. Underneath this manoeuvring is careless cruelty to trans people, who despite being 1% of the population are apparently the issue of the age, and yet whose suffering and exclusion doesn’t feature in the discourse at all. Beneath every confected outrage about trans athletes, trans prisoners and men pretending to be trans in order to lurk in toilets, there is a consistent theme, that trans people are not victims but predators. It’s such a fanciful reversal of reality – in which trans people are beset by horrifying levels of hate crime, homelessness and domestic violence – that the entire debate is starting to sound baffled and stupefied. That’s no excuse for Labour, who should be able to see exactly what course to take.

4/7/2022,"For Ruth Serwotka, the lowest point came on 13 February 2020. She was making coffee when Lisa Nandy, then a candidate for the Labour leadership, was asked on the radio about Woman’s Place UK, the grassroots campaigning organisation that Serwotka had helped found three years earlier. “She refused to say that we are not a hate group. I left the Labour party then. Up to that point I’d been determined to stay but I wasn’t prepared to be savaged and maligned any longer.” Woman’s Place UK advocates for women’s sex-based rights, including single-sex services, and is partly responsible for turning support for these rights into a social movement. Campaigners like Serwotka believe that since the oppression of women has historically been based on sex, women’s rights must be understood as sex-based too – and I agree with them. This view places feminists like us, also known as gender-critical, in conflict with trans rights activists and their allies, who believe that gender identity and not sex determines whether they are a man or a woman. From a legal perspective it is correct to say that the protected characteristic of gender reassignment covers people who are planning to transition as well as those who have undergone surgery or other treatment. This means that the group of transgender people protected from discrimination in existing UK law is not limited to those who have changed their legal sex. But the gender activist movement (which is not limited to trans people) wants to go further, with a law reform widely known as “self-ID” already introduced in some countries, which makes it possible for a person to change their legal sex without a diagnosis of gender dysphoria (as the sense of unease caused by a sense of mismatch between biological sex and gender identity is known). The recommendation by a parliamentary committee in 2016 that the UK government should reform the Gender Recognition Act (GRA) to this end is the background to the setting up of Woman’s Place UK. But it is important to recognise that the issue is wider than one law. Sex-based rights activists also started organising in response to the changing reality on the ground, including for providers of women’s services, that was created by a cultural shift towards more people identifying as trans, incorporating non-binary and genderqueer people as well as those seeking to transition medically. In practical terms, what Woman’s Place UK and other groups sought was greater clarity around the provisions in the Equality Act known as single-sex exceptions. These set out when it is legitimate and proportionate to exclude people with the protected characteristic of gender reassignment (trans people) from single-sex settings such as sports and refuges. The Equality and Human Rights Commission issued new guidance to that effect on Monday, two years after the UK government announced that it would not reform the GRA. Sex-based rights activists, in other words, have got some of what they wanted (the situation is different in Scotland, where Nicola Sturgeon plans to introduce a self-ID law). But the bitterness regarding Labour’s treatment of them remains. Shortly before the radio interview that led Serwotka to quit Labour, Nandy, Angela Rayner and Dawn Butler all expressed support for a campaign that labelled Woman’s Place UK “transphobic”, and called for its supporters to be expelled from the party. Since neither Rayner nor Nandy has resiled from this view, it remains questionable whether the Labour frontbench regards sex-based rights activism as a legitimate activity or a hateful one. Political difficulties regarding these complex issues are not confined to Labour. The government too is struggling to reconcile the claims of trans activism with those of sex-based rights advocates. So are the sporting authorities. Rows over recent days regarding the participation of the transgender cyclist Emily Bridges in women’s events, and ministers’ decision not to go ahead with a proposed ban on conversion practices of trans people due to concerns around the rising number of young people with gender dysphoria, show the range of policy implications. But Labour’s discomfort has been particularly acute over recent weeks, as politician after politician has been asked to define the word “woman”, and answer questions such as “Can a woman have a penis?” In a legal sense the answer is yes, since the Gender Recognition Act made it possible for someone to change the sex on their birth certificate without undergoing surgery. But senior figures have expressed concern that they are made to look ridiculous in voters’ eyes with long-winded answers, and their discomfort is easily exploited both by opponents and journalists seeking headlines. Over the weekend a campaign called Respect My Sex was launched, which aims to make this an issue in the local elections. What effect this will have is unclear. Lisa Townsend, a Conservative police and crime commissioner, said recently that any politician who claims not to have been asked about this issue by voters “is lying”. Many on the left remain dismissive, insisting that there are other more important concerns, not least skyrocketing heating bills and cuts to benefits. But passions run high on questions pertaining to identity – and can easily be stoked higher. Rosalind Shorrocks, an academic who studies gender and electoral politics, says trans and sex-based rights are not currently prominent among voters’ priorities. “But in an election, if the parties were to take different positions, and make them part of their campaigns, there is the potential for it to become important.” Polling data, like everything else in this debate, is contested. Broadly speaking, the public shows a strong and heartening level of support for the principle that people should be able to identify and live as they choose. But in 2020 a majority opposed making it easier for people to change their legal sex, and the inclusion of transgender women in female sports. If and when Labour returns to government, some of the policy issues may have been resolved. Women’s Aid last week issued a statement in support of single-sex spaces, while stressing the need for services for trans people. The new Equality and Human Rights Commission guidance clarifies the position for providers of single-sex services, including the need to consider the needs of transgender people and to balance these with the needs of others. The outcome of several court cases brought by gender-critical feminists who believe they have suffered harassment or discrimination will provide important precedents for employers and others. Many people, including me, believe there is scope for compromise. Somewhat ironically, given the present level of acrimony, Labour policy currently rests on a compromise that was struck before the 2019 general election. Then, support for the single-sex exceptions in the Equality Act was added to the party’s existing policy of reforming the Gender Recognition Act. But Labour’s treatment of women’s groups has, in my view, created a serious problem. For all the frequent complaints that the issue is “toxic”, and Keir Starmer’s calls for “respectful” discussion, the fact is that there is no equivalent on the gender-critical side to the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights’ call for women to be expelled from the party or the repeated attacks on the gender-critical Labour MP Rosie Duffield. There are no shadow cabinet members deriding LGBTQ+ campaigners as “dinosaurs”, as David Lammy said of sex-based rights campaigners. And there are no prominent LGBTQ+ service-providers barred from joining Labour, as the feminist domestic violence campaigner Karen Ingala Smith was in 2020. Serwotka may have left Labour, but a group called Labour Women’s Declaration advocates for sex-based rights within the party, and is also engaged in cross-party efforts. Currently, between 20 and 40 Labour MPs are known to be sympathetic. I hope they can persuade Labour to shift its position with regard to the sex-based rights of women. Not only because I agree with them. But because I don’t think it would be at all surprising if voters were to turn against politicians who speak in riddles about the differences between male and female bodies – and deride advocacy on behalf of biologically female people as a relic from prehistory.
