2/8/2022,"On 13 August last year, a villager in Ostrówka, in the east of central Poland, posted two pictures on Facebook featuring groups of men, women and children walking through the cornfields with bags on their backs. They were families from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraqi Kurdistan, and they were among the first asylum seekers to enter the country from Belarus. The post was accompanied by the following short text: “In the heat of day through wheat, at night through corn, they sneak through, they wander, just to get to the west. Great politics and slight refugees leave their print on the fields near Ostrówka.”  Few could have imagined that those people were the prelude to a border crisis that would result in dozens of deaths. The makeshift shelter of a Syrian family with small children in the forest near Narewka, Poland The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, had just started to organise the movement of asylum seekers with the promise of a safe passage to Europe, apparently in reprisal for sanctions that Brussels had imposed on his regime. A new migration route to the EU had opened. The humanitarian emergency reached its peak in November, when the Belarusian security forces escorted thousands of asylum seekers to the Polish border in an escalation of the crisis. Witnesses told the Guardian how Belarusian troops gathered groups of up to 50 people and cut the barbed wire to allow them to cross. Most of the asylum seekers were caught, and illegally and violently pushed back to Belarus by Poland’s border guards. But hundreds managed to escape into the forests. Trapped between the violence of the Polish authorities and false promises from the Belarusians, families lived in small tents, trying to keep warm in damp sleeping bags as night-time temperatures fell below zero. Polish border guards at a checkpoint near the border with Belarus and with a family who were hiding in the forest In response to the Belarusian threats, Poland’s hard-right government quadrupled the presence of border guards and troops in the area and created a two-mile-deep militarised zone ringed with razor-wire. It was a show of force not seen in the country since the end of the cold war. Dozens of checkpoints punctuate the perimeter of this so-called red zone, which is inaccessible to aid workers and journalists. The soldiers stop and search every car as police vehicles and helicopters monitor the area. Top, a family from Duhok, Iraq, in Narewka, Poland, after crossing from Belarus. Above left, an Iraqi woman and her baby are taken to safety by aid workers before certain capture by Polish border guards Every night in the forests, there is a race between border guards and aid workers to reach the asylum seekers hidden among the trees. If the Polish police arrive before the volunteers and doctors, they will probably send the migrants back to Belarus, with the risk that their health may deteriorate. Many of those found in the woods can barely walk after travelling long distances on foot. Some have not eaten in days. The children often have signs of hypothermia.

Most of the people known to have died since the start of the border standoff were killed by the cold At least 19 people have died since the beginning of the border standoff between Poland and Belarus. Most of them froze to death. Some were buried in the village of Bohoniki, near the Polish town of Sokółka, in the heart of the forest that claimed their lives. People told the Guardian they found the bodies of refugees torn apart by animals. A family of asylum seekers said they had to bury their mother, covering her with leaves. “In the area of forest where migrants normally camp, you can smell an intense stench of decay,” says one resident. Some Polish families have been hiding desperate asylum seekers in their homes. In the attics of the cottages scattered in the forests along the border, Iraqi Kurds and Syrians tremble with cold and fear, while border guards search for them outside. If found, the Polish families who have offered them shelter risk being charged with aiding illegal immigration.

The green light in their home in Hajnówka, near the border, right, is a welcome sign for refugees Kamil Syller and his wife, Maria Przyszychowska, started a network of residents and activists who put green lights in their windows to show that their home is a temporary safe space for refugees. “We are trying to protect asylum seekers and now our activity has become a form of resistance,” says Kamil. “But we don’t want to be heroes and it’s becoming really frustrating.” The green lights have also come to the attention of the Polish authorities. For weeks, Maria and Kamil’s home has been under surveillance. Border guards patrol the streets around their home and lie in wait for people to come out of the forest so they can capture them and push them back into Belarus.

The Polish lawyer filed papers with the European court of human rights in an effort to stop them being deported to Belarus According to data from Grupa Granica, a Polish network of human rights organisations, about 10,000 asylum seekers reached Germany from Belarus via Poland by December. Many others were transferred to migrant camps near the Belarus border. The Guardian spoke to dozens of asylum applicants in the Polish city of Białystok. All said they had arrived in Minsk by buying packages from travel agencies, which, according to the refugees, appeared to be closely connected to the Belarusian authorities. Despite promises from Turkish and Belarusian airlines to limit these flights, the crisis appears to be far from over. Thousands of asylum seekers remain in Belarus.

In this 10,000 sq metre space, patrolled by dozens of armed soldiers, about 1,000 asylum seekers are sleeping in makeshift cots made from planks and cardboard on shelving units once used for merchandise. There are dozens of children and elderly people, many in need of medical help. Outside, people sit around and heat up food on a wood-burning stove. There are showers but no hot water.

2/8/2022,"New Zealand’s justice ministry has launched an investigation into whether a crime scene cleaning company broke the law by posting images to its social media pages of cleanup sites – including, allegedly, images of suspected suicide sites and of human remains. The story was first reported by RNZ, which found Christchurch company Crime Scene Cleaners had posted images to its Facebook and Instagram accounts – including graphic images of decomposing human remains, and images of cleanup work in the aftermath of suspected suicides.  New Zealand laws restrict the publication of details relating to suspected or confirmed suicides that suggest the method of death. A death may not be referred to as a suicide until the coroner has made that determination after a coronial investigation. Crime Scene Cleaners general manager, Carl Loader, told the Guardian he and the company were “deeply upset that our social media pages have caused the reaction that they have today. We sincerely apologise to anyone that has been offended by them. “We had thought that by sharing some of the images from our work, we would raise awareness of some important social issues, and what our company do[es],” he said. “As the manager, I should have kept a close eye on the content that was being shared.” Loader said the company had taken down all social media pages, and would be “reviewing our future on social media”. Speaking to RNZ, some customers who had employed the service after the death of a family member said that homes were clearly identifiable in some of the images posted, with a variety of identifying objects. RNZ reported that in one photo posted to social media, a smiling staff member held a piece of human bone, after working to clean a train that had hit and killed the person. Other photos of human remains were published with casual or degrading captions, RNZ reported. Some of the images or captions allegedly indicated how the person had died. The photos in question have now been removed. The company’s website says it specialises in crime scene and trauma cleanup. “We understand your requirements for the highest level of discretion and have highly trained professional technicians in biological forensic decontamination & remediation ready to tackle your issue,” it says. “The aftermath of a self-inflicted death or homicide can be disturbing and leave scenes that can cause additional emotional trauma. Cleaning these scenes is best left to trained professionals who are not personally involved with the family.” A coronial spokesperson at New Zealand’s ministry of justice said “The behaviour in question that may have breached the Coroners Act includes Crime Scene Cleaners publishing photos and comments on social media that mention the method of suicide. “The office of the chief coroner is considering whether any breaches … have occurred,” they said. “The Coroners Act also enables a coroner to prohibit the making public of any evidence given at any part of a coronial inquiry, in the interests of justice, decency, public order, or personal privacy.” In New Zealand the Suicide Crisis Helpline is 0508 828 865 (0508 TAUTOKO).You can also call Lifeline on 0800 543 354 (0800 LIFELINE) or free text 4357 (HELP), or the Samaritans on 0800 726 666.

2/8/2022,"The hosiery did not begin as a fashion statement. John “Long Socks” McLaren, the caddie famed for his flamboyant on-course attire, had a practical reason to stand out from the crowd. “It started in a fire,” McLaren explains. “I couldn’t expose my legs to the sun after that. I would have been 24/25 at a house and there was a fire, we were chucking debris on it to clear stuff. There was a methane pocket in it and it blew up to burn my legs from the knees down when I was wearing shorts.  “I had to wear long socks playing tennis at that point under doctor’s orders and ended up just sticking with it. I started caddying in the US and everyone had shorts on; they told me to pull the socks down but I was only ever pulling them up.” For at least the time being, McLaren has hung up his bib. After 30 seasons, 18 wins and a dozen players, the popular 55-year-old has decided to step back from caddie duties. The Saudi International, alongside Paul Casey, marked McLaren’s final event as he reverts to family duties in Surrey. Had coronavirus not struck, McLaren estimates he would continue working for another three years. “My children are eight and nine,” says McLaren. “My son broke his arm during the last Ryder Cup and I wasn’t there. My daughter was born during Lytham in 2012 and because of the Open, I have never really been there for her birthday. “Covid travel became so much more difficult. I have no mental health issues but I understand that there are a lot around because of this climate. I am mentally more tired because of travel and anxiety of testing positive after a two- or three-week trip then being stuck in a country when I have young kids. Similarly, I go home and they are in school and I worried about not being able to get back out to work. That created a lot of uncertainty I’d rather not have to deal with.” McLaren will be missed, including by Casey on account of his career rejuvenation after turning to the experienced bag man in 2015. “We didn’t know each other very well when we started. It was a business relationship and we’ve become best mates,” Casey says. McLaren believes Casey utilised his services as “more of a mentor or father figure”. McLaren in many ways represents the old-school caddie. He is, though, keen to point out the deep use of analysis and statistics that have made him so valuable in the current era. The role and profile of the caddie have changed; but for the better? “I don’t know about that, necessarily. I have always argued that you should take the most professional caddie if you are as ambitious as you say you are. Personally, I don’t see how a mate can necessarily be the most ambitious way of getting the best out of yourself. It needs someone to challenge you, someone to bring something that is different.” McLaren cites the “unbelievable experience” of the Rio Olympics, with Casey, as a career highlight. He was with Luke Donald for the 2012 Miracle of Medinah. “Luke was at the pinnacle of his powers,” McLaren recalls. “I had a great sense of knowing what to do for him at that point. There was great security there. “I will miss aspects of this. The camaraderie, the competition. I can’t say I haven’t got an ego because there’s enough of that in there to still make me want to be better than everybody else at this job. It rubs your ego when you do well. I will miss people like [the coach] Jamie Gough, a friend I have had for a long time. People like Ian Poulter. I think the world of Ian and I wouldn’t have had that without Ryder Cups.” McLaren refuses to rule out a return to the fairways, albeit after a decent rest. He will not quite speak of retirement. “Firstly, I am going to do school runs,” he adds. “I will be on the touchline for kids’ games at school. I will be back on my bike training like I used to. I’ll play a bit more social golf. I know for the next six to eight months there is pretty much no chance I’ll be back out here unless a world No 1 to 8 calls and says they would like my help to be better. For the foreseeable future, I will be at home.” Which is golf’s loss.",Sport/Sport,John ‘Long Socks’ McLaren hangs up his bib after 30 years carrying clubs,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/08/golf-john-long-socks-mclaren-hangs-up-his-bib-after-30-years-carrying-clubs
2/8/2022,"Emily Paterson was finally feeling able to relax. Her two sons were now fully vaccinated, and with mask policies in place at their school in northern Virginia she felt safe sending them every day, even as the Omicron variant surged. Then Virginia’s new governor, Glenn Youngkin, took office on 15 January of this year – and, with his second executive action, he made masks in schools optional.  A Virginia judge has blocked Youngkin’s order for now, allowing school districts to continue to enforce mask mandates in schools. But the decision “immediately threw the whole state into an uproar”, Paterson said. “It felt really like a slap in the face. We felt really happy that this year wasn’t virtual, and that we could rely on our kids going back to school in person and being safe. So it was pretty shocking.” Virginia isn’t alone in attempting to roll back precautions against Covid, as Omicron cases begin to fall in parts of the US and public backlash continues against public health measures. Kansas stopped contact tracing after many of those contacted refused to participate, and a Florida’ health official has said it’s time to “unwind” the “testing psychology”. In other places, however, the premature abandonment of restrictions is being met with its own opposition. The Fairfax county school board, which is Paterson’s home district and the largest in Virginia, quickly announced it would continue requiring masks for all students, and a week later Fairfax joined six other school districts in a lawsuit against the executive order. Parents in Chesapeake, Virginia, filed a separate lawsuit. Both suits argue that Virginia law requires schools to follow guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommends masks for everyone in schools with very rare exceptions. Parents of children with disabilities filed another lawsuit last week against the order, arguing that it makes schools an unsafe learning environment; yet another lawsuit, filed by parents against Loudoun county’s continued mandate, would support the governor’s order, however. The turmoil illustrates the fraught atmosphere in schools around removing precautions and the confusion surrounding increasingly complicated decisions in the third year of the pandemic. Most families in Virginia support precautions such as masks in schools. “He keeps saying things about, ‘Oh, it’s parent choice,’ but he’s actually going against the majority of parents,” Paterson said of Youngkin. Two-thirds of Virginia parents with students in public schools supported mask mandates in a September 2021 poll – slightly higher than the 61% of Americans nationally who supported the mandates in a November survey. Both surveys were conducted before the highest rise in Covid cases so far seen in the pandemic. “I would think the Omicron wave made people more nervous, not less,” said Neal McCluskey, an education analyst at the Cato Institute. The majority of Virginia schools have already been disregarding Youngkin’s executive order in favor of following the law on CDC guidance, according to an analysis from the Washington Post. Governor Ralph Northam mandated masks for K-12 schools in August, and a vocal minority criticized the rule. Youngkin’s reversal likely comes as a response to those objections, McCluskey said. “And I think that it’s fair to say those parents, as a group, have been much louder” – in part because the families in favor of masks didn’t feel the urge to speak up while a mandate was in place, he said. “You can sort of understand, if the parents I’m hearing from want a certain thing, and I’m not hearing from the others, maybe this group represents a whole lot of parents,” McCluskey said. Masks significantly reduce outbreaks in schools, research from the CDC shows. Schools without mask mandates are three times more likely to have outbreaks, and counties with mask requirements in schools had markedly less spread. There is no evidence that masks negatively affect children’s social, behavioral or linguistic development. “It’s too soon to roll back protections, full stop,” said Emily Smith, an assistant professor at the George Washington University’s School of Public Health. “We are still seeing massive outbreaks of infection. We’re still seeing health systems overloaded. And that’s because we haven’t come to this state of the world where transmission is predictable.” Covid is still very disruptive, causing shortages of staff and goods in many industries, she said. “Now is not a time to roll back protections. Now is the time to get the pandemic under control and plan for the next surge.” Experts have suggested that precautions such as masks be tied to local factors, such as rates of vaccination, cases, hospitalizations and the overall health profile of a community – including the number of at-risk adults and children. “We can make it very local – we can make it down to your school district,” Smith said. A small group of physicians and scientists has called for the removal of precautions including masks by 15 February, in order to get back to “normal”. Others say a return to normal can only happen once the virus is controlled. “It’s inconceivable to talk about removing mitigation measures at the height of a surge,” said Anne Sosin, a public policy fellow at Dartmouth College. The decisions should be based on “data, not dates”. “We don’t need endless restrictions, but we are simply not at a place to be talking about that,” she said of a deadline. “Maintaining rigorous school mitigation measures buys us more time to deliver vaccines and boosters.” About four out of five children between five and 11 years old are still unvaccinated and at risk for Covid. Sharp inequities persist among marginalized groups, Sosin said. “Vaccine availability doesn’t equal vaccine access, and we’ve seen persistent racial, income and rural disparities in vaccination,” she said. “Earlier, we saw that with significant outreach we can overcome many of those barriers, but we haven’t seen the mobilization of resources to ensure equity in vaccination in children.” Advocates for optional masking say children and staff are somewhat protected by their own masks, should they choose to wear them. Widespread masking is more effective, though. Not all children are able to wear masks; some students with special needs encounter sensory problems that make it difficult to wear them consistently: masking all students and teachers during a surge helps protect them. “It’s an inconvenience, but if it could possibly just keep one person safe, or keep one kid from having to be homeschooled, why wouldn’t we do it?” said Cori, a high-school theater teacher who asked to use a pseudonym. The masks also help keep students and staff from developing Covid complications that can arise even from mild cases, she said. “Having my children mask as a preventive measure to protect them from possibly having a lifelong health issue that could be avoidable – why would I not do that?” The ambiguity is an additional pandemic stress, Cori said. “Every room you go into, every hallway, there’s a counselor with a kid who’s having a panic attack, and I never saw that before,” she said. Some of the kids are worried about the virus; none of the students she knows worry about the masks themselves. “Growing minds depend on structure, so they can feel comfortable,” she said. “Their parents are fighting with their teacher, they hear a politician saying one thing, a news reporter saying another … I think that’s terrifying to them.” The new rule on masks “threw everyone into turmoil when the current system had been working pretty well – everyone felt there was some consistency, everyone was used to it,” Paterson said. “One of the difficulties of the pandemic is the fact that the situation is always changing. As human beings, I think it’s really hard to understand and interpret what the immediate threat level is,” she said. She suggested Virginia and other states adopt a “traffic light” system similar to New Zealand’s, where each district’s statistics are distilled into red, yellow and green codes that would then guide their use of precautions. “It’s not like the pandemic is ever going away in the near future, so we have to adapt by reacting intelligently to the most recent data,” she said. “I totally get that everyone is just so tired of it. But it seems like magical thinking to have that be a reason you just give up entirely on any kind of protections.” McCluskey believes the decision should be left to school districts. “You have to take into account what other measures the schools are using for safety,” including air filtration, vaccine mandates and other precautions, McCluskey said. “That’s what we should want, to tailor the policies as best we can to the needs of actual people, rather than saying, well, one size is going to have to fit everyone.” The mask situation is one more stressor for educators feeling the weight of the past two years. “This debate, which didn’t need to be politicized, is affecting the educational system, which was already broken,” Cori said. “It’s hard to teach kids when their parents are telling them that you are the enemy.” Masks and other precautions help keep schools open, Sosin said. Taking them away when vaccinations rates among children are still low and cases are still high is like “building schools on floodplains, thinking the water is not going to come”.",News/Education,‘A slap in the face’: uproar in Virginia as governor relaxes school mask rules,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/08/virginia-school-mask-fight-reveals-fractures-covid-responses
2/8/2022,"British farmers must reduce their production of meat and dairy by a third in the next 10 years if scientific advice on limiting greenhouse gas emissions is to be met, the conservation charity WWF has said. Even greater cuts may be needed to the UK’s pig herds and poultry flocks, because of the imported feed they eat, and people will need to eat much less meat than they do today, the charity warned. But the result would be lower greenhouse gas emissions, a countryside with more wildlife and flourishing nature, and better health, according to the report.  Tanya Steele, chief executive of WWF, said: “If we are serious about tackling the twin threats of climate change and nature loss, farming and land use can’t be an afterthought. Many UK farmers are already using their skills and expertise to produce food as sustainably as possible, but they won’t be able to fix a broken system on their own.” Livestock are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, from the methane they produce and through the carbon associated with the feed they eat. WWF said the UK’s imports of soy for animal feed must be cut by about a fifth by 2030, as it is associated with deforestation and the overuse of fertiliser overseas. Livestock are also associated with air pollution, from the ammonia that comes from their manure, which the government has vowed to tackle. Farmers defended the UK’s livestock production as lower carbon than overseas alternatives, however. Stuart Roberts, deputy president of the National Farmers’ Union, said: “Our farmers can deliver the necessary environmental and climate benefits while maintaining domestic food production, including the production of nutritious meat and dairy, and it’s important that we do so. With more than 90% of UK households still wanting to buy high quality red meat and dairy, British products are often the most sustainable options.” He said the UK’s climate was well suited to the production of beef and dairy products, and emissions from meat and dairy in the UK were less than half the global average. “If we reduced sustainable production here, it would only export our carbon footprint to countries which don’t meet our own high environmental standards, and risk seeing food imports reduced to standards that would be illegal here,” he added. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, rejected the need for drastic cuts to UK meat and dairy production: “Of the UK’s CO2e emissions, only 10% are emitted by UK agriculture. The bulk of UK emissions come from transport and energy accounting for over half of total emissions. With UK agriculture accounting for over two-thirds of the UK landmass, its carbon emissions are already incredibly low by comparison to other land uses. If 70% of the landmass produces 10% of the emissions it must mean that the remaining 30% produces 90% of the emissions. Every acre of land in agriculture is already less polluting by a factor of 20 in comparison to every acre of land in another sector.” He added: “The vast majority of farmers understand the responsibility on them to both produce great food and as custodians of the environment. Our livestock farmers manage carbon in their soils on our behalf every day of the week and deserve our support, not our criticism. In fact, we should be eating more meat and dairy products from UK sources to offset what we import to reduce our carbon footprint.” Rob Percival, head of food and policy at the Soil Association, said British households should reduce their meat consumption but buy higher quality meat. “Nature-friendly, agroecological farming can feed a growing population, but only if we eat less and better meat, ensuring what we do eat is high welfare, so that we can eliminate intensive animal farming and all the risks it poses to animal welfare, habitats for wildlife, and human health,” he said. He added that grazing cattle could support healthy soils and nature, but that big reductions in the intensive production of poultry were needed, as cheap chicken production was driving river pollution in the UK, as well as deforestation in South America through imported soy. He called for an end to post-Brexit trade deals that would open the door to low-welfare food with a high carbon footprint. Vicki Hird, head of sustainable farming at the campaigning organisation Sustain, said the government must take a lead in making British farming more sustainable, by taking a “less but better” approach to meat. “The government could help by incentivising the production of sustainable, pasture-fed beef and only choosing less but better meat and more plants in public procurement contracts. The government spends £2bn a year on food and could be a lot smarter and do a lot more good with what it buys.” Food waste is also a major problem, and needs to be halved by 2030, according to the WWF report. Efforts to cut food waste in households appeared to bear fruit during the Covid-19 lockdowns, but supermarkets and their rejection of “imperfect” but edible food are still major causes of waste. The report also called for big reductions in the use of artificial fertiliser, through using precision techniques and ending the use of nitrogen fertiliser where possible, in favour of natural alternatives. Fertiliser prices have risen strongly in recent months, owing to high energy prices.",News/Environment,"Cut meat and dairy production by a third to save climate, British farmers told",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/cut-meat-and-dairy-by-a-third-to-save-climate-british-farmers-told
2/8/2022,"Evidence of “collusive behaviour” between police and loyalist paramilitary groups related to murders during the Troubles have been uncovered by a watchdog investigation. Marie Anderson, the police ombudsman for Northern Ireland, said she was “deeply concerned” by the “significant failures” she had uncovered in her investigation into murders and attempted murders carried out by the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in south Belfast in the 1990s.  Eight loyalist attacks attributed to the UDA or its Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF) cover name were examined in the ombudsman’s 344-page report published on Tuesday. Eleven people were murdered in the attacks, including five who lost their lives in the Sean Graham bookmakers attack in February 1992. Among her findings, Anderson said Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) files relating to the bookmakers massacre had been deliberately destroyed. She also said the use by RUC special branch of informants who had been involved in murders was “totally unacceptable”. Although there was no evidence that police had received information that would have allowed them to prevent the attacks, the ombudsman questioned why no such intelligence was received, given that special branch had a network of informants within the UDA/UFF. An appeal court judgment in 2020 has limited the scope of the ombudsman to accuse former officers of the criminal offence of collusion with paramilitaries. Acknowledging this limitation, Anderson said she had identified conduct within the RUC that amounted to “collusive behaviours”. She said the long-held concerns of bereaved families and survivors about RUC conduct, including complaints of collusion with paramilitaries, were “legitimate and justified”. Anderson said “collusive behaviours” identified in her report included: Intelligence and surveillance failings, which led to loyalist paramilitaries obtaining military grade weaponry in a 1987 arms importation. A failure to warn two men of threats to their lives. A failure to retain records and the deliberate destruction of files relating to the attack at Sean Graham bookmakers. The failure to maintain records about the deactivation of weapons, “indicating a desire to avoid accountability for these sensitive and contentious activities”. The failure of police to exploit all evidential opportunities. Failures by special branch to disseminate intelligence to murder investigation teams. An absence of control and oversight in the recruitment and management of informants. Unjustifiable and continued use by special branch of informants involved in serious criminality, including murder and “turning a blind eye” to such activities. A senior PSNI officer said the report made “uncomfortable reading” and apologised to the families of those killed and injured. The murders and attempted murders were carried out between 1990 and 1998. All the victims were Catholic. Christy Doherty, Jack Duffin, Peter Magee, Willie McManus and 15-year-old James Kennedy all died in the betting shop attack. The report also covered the murders of Harry Conlon and Aidan Wallace in 1991, Michael Gilbride in 1992, Martin Moran in 1993, Theresa Clinton in 1994 and Larry Brennan in 1998. It also examined the attempted murder of Samuel Caskey in 1990.

2/8/2022,"Few people read books about philosophy nowadays, if they ever did, but there is a larger audience for books about philosophers. One of the more successful examples in this flourishing genre was David Edmonds’s and John Eidinow’s Wittgenstein’s Poker, published in 2001, which examined a brief and tense meeting between Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper that took place in Cambridge in 1946. Metaphysical Animals bears some resemblance to that book insofar as it has two authors – the philosophers Clare Mac Cumhaill and Rachael Wiseman – and concerns roughly the same period. It even features an influential walk-on part for Wittgenstein.  The big difference is that it looks at four philosophers, all of whom are women, and it is spread out over a number of years. By focusing on a disputed encounter of just a few minutes, Edmonds and Eidinow gave themselves a tight structure that offered a tidy means of exploring deeper questions of philosophy. The trick in this kind of work is to be able to move from scene-setting to difficult intellectual questions without losing the reader. Metaphysical Animals lacks the narrative discipline of Wittgenstein’s Poker, and as a result is a baggier and less clearly defined book. It’s really tied together by its subtitle: How Four Women Brought Philosophy Back to Life. The quartet in question are Elizabeth Anscombe, Iris Murdoch, Mary Midgley and Philippa Foot, all of whom studied philosophy at Oxford in the late 1930s and early 1940s. In the late 1930s, British philosophy, at least at Oxford, was dominated by AJ Ayer, whose groundbreaking book Language, Truth and Logic was published in 1936. Ayer was the chief promoter of logical positivism, a school of thought that aimed to clean up philosophy by ruling out large areas of the field as unverifiable and therefore not fit for logical discussion. In a sense, it sought to rid philosophy of metaphysics, those abstract questions of being and knowing that students have traditionally liked to explore late at night after one too many stimulants. It also rendered much of moral philosophy as little more than an expression of emotional preferences. Anscombe, Murdoch, Midgley and Foot were not fans of logical positivism dogmatism or conclusions. Fortunately for them, if not for the world, the second world war intervened in their studies, removing Ayer and his acolytes from Oxford, and bringing a large influx of European émigré philosophers. Suddenly metaphysics was back in fashion, or at least no longer frowned upon. The four women all committed to establishing themselves as philosophers, and sought to refute Ayer and his ilk. Mac Cumhaill and Wiseman do attempt to explain how they did this, but too often the arguments are lost under a welter of descriptions of daily life in Oxford, with all its strange academic rituals, arcane language and general sense of inwardness, as well a great deal of incidental detail. If you want to know what colour of silk cushions and bedspread Foot had in her rooms near Somerville College, then this is the book to read. Similarly, if your thing is the extended social connections of the Oxford intelligentsia, it’s a handy resource. But the general reader interested in the subject may wish that it devoted the same care to dealing with philosophical definitions, or where Wittgenstein stood in relation to the debates around logical positivism, as it does in bringing to life the rarefied milieu of Boars Hill. The problem, of course, with philosophy is: where do you start and where do you end? It’s an overarching discipline in which people write whole books on strictly limited concepts. What level of knowledge should be assumed of the reader? Even within its own defined terms, Metaphysical Animals isn’t entirely convincing in making its case. It’s hard to get an objective sense of where these four women stood in terms of influence in the greater scheme of philosophy, either as individuals or as a group. Indeed, it’s not entirely clear whether they ever amounted to a group beyond being friends. That they played an active part in challenging the rigid materialism of prewar British philosophy is beyond doubt. But as the authors note, it was the war itself, and the many atrocities it engendered, that gave urgent impetus to a new moral philosophy. Anscombe, for example, wanted to establish an ethical basis on which it could be established that the Nazis were objectively wrong. She is said to have coined the term “consequentialism” – the notion that it is the consequences rather than the intentions by which your conduct should be judged. She was arguably the most eminent of the four in terms of philosophy, though of course Murdoch made a larger impact as a novelist. Late in her life I interviewed Midgley, who still spoke in dismissive terms of Ayer, though she claimed he had renounced his views (which was not entirely true). She spoke of a “life force” and was scathing about what she called the “scientism” of her new bete noire, Richard Dawkins. She was enormously engaging, but lurking around the edges of her thought was something mystical and celebratory that left her excluded from mainstream philosophy. A similar tone sometimes informs the pages of this book. It would be wrong to call it religious, though Anscombe, a practising Catholic, speaks seriously about the “divine”. Perhaps it’s nothing more, nor less, than the profound excitement experienced by four young women shaking off the suffocating orthodoxies of male domination.

But when I tried to download it on to my iPhone, an error message appeared saying that I couldn’t, as it needed an iOS operating system of 13.4 or above. The one on my phone is 12.5. As I had already booked some rail tickets with a senior railcard deduction I was forced to buy a one-year £30 paper senior railcard at the local station.  Trainline initially said it would refund this, but is now refusing to on the basis that I must have used their railcard. I explained again what had happened and that I had had to buy a paper one, and sent a copy, but still it won’t refund me my £70.JK, by email I am amazed that I had to get involved in this case given that you had sent the copy of the second railcard. Trainline told me that the three-year deal is digital-only, and that its website does set out which devices are compatible. However, it did agree to repay you. “We appreciate that JK did not feel this was made clear enough, and so we’re happy to provide him with a full refund as a gesture of goodwill, which is now on its way,” it says.

2/8/2022,"He is a prolific political publisher, whose books and websites have caused toe-curling embarrassment for prime ministers – and now for one political spouse. But for Michael Ashcroft, the billionaire businessman and Tory donor, his books on the major political players are all about influence. Before the revelations this week from a forthcoming book, First Lady, about Carrie Johnson, Ashcroft’s most famous revelation was David Cameron’s “pig-gate” scandal in his book Call Me Dave. That was widely accused of being a personal hatchet job after his relationship with the then-prime minister deteriorated.  Since then, Ashcroft has published exposés on the UK’s faltering defence and health service, as well as a number of political biographies. Those are not always intended as takedowns – he published warm biographies of Rishi Sunak and Jacob Rees-Mogg when their political careers were in the ascendancy. His quest for political influence is not limited to books: he has a controlling stake in the influential ConservativeHome website and is the largest shareholder in Dods, a parliamentary website that publishes PoliticsHome and the House magazine and subscription services read widely in Westminster and Whitehall. There is certainly some significant editorial freedom; on Monday ConHome’s editor Paul Goodman publicly questioned whether Carrie Johnson was fair game. “Whether the charge is true or not, it deflects from the main point. Which is that the prime minister himself, not his spouse, bears responsibility for his decisions,” he wrote. First Lady’s publication is understood to have been brought forward after Johnson’s premiership was imperilled by partygate. The book makes a number of significant – and disputed – allegations, including that Carrie Johnson messaged staff from the prime minister’s phone, interfered in significant political decisions and arranged to have staff members hired or dismissed, depending on who was in favour. Ashcroft does not publish to make money; his net worth is an estimated $2.1bn, the bulk of which comes from the sale of home security company ADT. He is a citizen of Belize, where he is a major investor. “These books and websites are not about making money, it’s about being a player, being part of the political conversation and making headlines,” one former associate said. “He doesn’t micromanage, but he knows the books need a spicy anecdote to get serialisations.” Ashcroft employs writers and researchers for his books, usually a lead author with a small team. They are a select, trusted few, including the former Sunday Times political editor Isabel Oakeshott and the ex-Mail on Sunday journalist Miles Goslett. Those who have worked with Ashcroft say he is as keen to spot, cultivate and endorse upcoming talent as he is to turn the spotlight on those who have slighted him. Ashcroft has been open about his “beef” with Cameron, despite a previous closeness, after Cameron did not offer him a significant government job in 2010. Cameron blamed the Liberal Democrats, who were in coalition government, and offered Ashcroft a junior Foreign Office post. “It would have been better had Cameron offered me nothing at all,” Ashcroft wrote. “After ploughing some £8m into the party, I regarded this as a declinable offer.” Craig Oliver, Cameron’s spin doctor, said that Ashcroft’s methods needed to be scrutinised. He wrote in the Spectator that the claims made by Ashcroft and his co-author Isabel Oakeshott about Cameron’s alleged fellatio with a pig head had no verifiable sourcing but blew up into a big story regardless. “The claim was deeply cynical, because those behind it knew that even though there was no proof, it would be toxic anyway,” he wrote. “Any attempt to say the story wasn’t true would result in ‘PM denies pig sex claim’ headlines, leading some to believe there is no smoke without fire. In the end, all I could advise was that we say nothing, starving the story of any extra energy.” Oliver said he detected something similar in one of the more explosive claims in the book about Carrie Johnson, that she used the prime minister’s phone to give directions to staffers. “The anonymous source is merely guessing about what had gone on, with no solid evidence to back up their assertion,” he wrote. “I have no idea if the story is true or not – but readers deserve higher standards of proof than this for it to be simply thrown into the public domain.” One source who knows Cameron said he had made peace with the book. He is known to have at least two copies on his bookshelves at his family home. Ashcroft has rarely made forays into senior Labour figures, but in August last year he published Red Knight, an unauthorised biography of Keir Starmer. It was in this book where the seeds of Johnson’s attack against Starmer for allegedly not prosecuting Jimmy Savile were planted in many Tories’ minds, though it makes clear Starmer was not personally involved in the decision. In fact, the book argues Starmer should be held responsible for Operation Midland, the police investigation of false accusations of sexual abuse levelled at several public figures. Ashcroft claims that in the wake of the failure to prosecute the paedophile Jimmy Savile, which happened while Starmer was director of public prosecutions – though it did not involve him personally – he embraced an “ideology” that said victims’ testimony should be believed, which became widely influential. Ashcroft seeks to draw a line from that to the credibility police lent the alleged victim, “Nick”, who was subsequently convicted of perverting the course of justice. Ashcroft claims the case continues to “haunt” Starmer, as much as it does the Met. But there was little that troubled Starmer’s team. One team member said they had adopted a rigid non-cooperation policy, which Ashcroft acknowledges in the book, and its authors had found it very difficult to find disaffected or wronged former associates of Starmer – even among his ex-girlfriends. Very few of Starmer’s friends, colleagues, associates or teachers were prepared to be interviewed at all. For Carrie Johnson, there is no shortage of anonymous, aggrieved former colleagues, Downing Street staffers, Tory aides and ex-friends. The motivation for Ashcroft to dig into the private life and influence of the prime minister’s wife is less transparent than his feud with Cameron. Goodman speculated it was about maintaining political intrigue and relevance: “Our proprietor likes to make news and get talked about.” The charge against Ashcroft from Johnson’s supporters is that she is not an elected politician, with no ability to publicly defend herself. One Tory friend called the book a “witch-hunt” and said there was a consensus that in publishing the book, Ashcroft had gone “a step too far”. The friend pointed to Ashcroft’s ownership of Dods, which produces an annual women in leadership event, calling it “duplicitous” that “Ashcroft is making money out of a conference to help women and at the same time publishing a book which is deeply misogynistic and sexist.” But Ashcroft insists that scrutiny of Johnson is in the public interest. “The evidence I have gathered suggests his wife’s behaviour is preventing him from leading Britain as effectively as the voters deserve,” he wrote.",News/UK news,Is it Carrie Johnson’s turn to be embarrassed by Michael Ashcroft?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/is-it-carrie-johnsons-turn-to-be-embarrassed-by-michael-ashcroft
2/8/2022,"First your children idolise you, then they see through you, then they forgive you. That’s how the parenting cliche goes. I remember when I first read it. The kids were really small, and I’d stolen 25 seconds from the ceaselessness to look at Twitter, which was all I ever looked at then. Before long, two sentences came to represent the absolute outer limit of my concentration span, and that, I’m afraid, is still true. The end of idolisation can’t come soon enough, I thought. Roll on seeing through me, bring forth scornful self-reliance. Sure, it will be sad when the magic of childhood is replaced by the cynicism of adolescence, but on the plus side, at least they’ll be able to travel unaided to the toilet. I maybe didn’t give enough thought to what the process of being seen through would entail. It starts with the systematic, real-time dismantling of all authority. These are all the things I’m no longer to be trusted on, as of this weekend: what length hair should be; where to play badminton; which of geography and history is more interesting; categories of skin type (“oily” and “combination” are no longer in use, in the 21st century); anything to do with vegetarianism, or Ukraine, or animal husbandry; computers and phones; how to cross a road; the world of work; and the identification of insects. I didn’t even realise how much casual authority I had until it was all stripped away. I think I debased the currency by having too many strong opinions. Now I could have a full wheelbarrow of views and it wouldn’t buy me even a single slice of credibility.  I suggested we all take a new approach, work on the assumption that I’m ignorant of almost everything, and only mention the subjects on which I am still a trusted source. “The 1960s,” said one. “I wasn’t alive in the 1960s!” “OK, boomer,” said the other. “I’m not a boomer! I’m generation X!” “Boomer is more of a vibe,” said the first. “Being surprised by completely predictable things,” said the second. “I completely trust you to be amazed by things that aren’t amazing.” It came at me quite fast, this shift from “oracle” to “person who is wrong about almost everything”, but I’m developing some adaptive strategies, such as “being wrong on purpose, to comic effect” and “not completely listening”. Much harder to process is the cast change: for years, in the drama that is any household, the parents are the main characters, and the children have supporting roles, bringing cute moments and weird allergies to give texture to the narrative arc of the leads. Then, wham! One night, there you are, watching TV, perhaps you fall asleep a little earlier than you planned, perhaps the next generation stays up chatting past midnight. However they managed to orchestrate this, it has happened: they are now the heroes. If anyone were to make a poster of us all, their names would be bigger. The process must have been incremental, so how did I not see it coming? Did it start when one was suddenly taller? Or when one of the short ones started having a bath of their own free will? Economists say that the individual’s contract with capitalism is premised on seeing one’s children do better than oneself, and I always think: doesn’t that depend on the baseline? If you were rich already, would you necessarily long for your children to be richer? Could this be one of those things that economists are wrong about? To see your children become the protagonist, on the other hand – to become, yourself, a footnote to their story, a stub in their Wikipedia entry, this was definitely the whole point. It’s the natural order of things. You sure as hell wouldn’t want it the other way round. So why is it so incredibly surprising? Oh right, I forgot: being surprised by completely predictable things – that’s my specialist subject.
