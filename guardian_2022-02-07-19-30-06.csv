2/7/2022,"What is your first memory of breasts? Your mother’s? Her smell, her warmth, the feeling of unfathomable safety emanating from her soft skin? Or was it the huge, tanned, bouncing boobs of a blond woman, speaking in Swedish on Eurotrash, a programme you knew you definitely were too young to watch? Like many women, I understood the power of breasts long before I actually had them. They were something that could be used for attention, hoisted up and pushed together, offered willingly to the male gaze. Conversely I also knew they were a body part that – through no fault of their own – seemed to demand comment.  I remember the girls at school who wore two sports bras because they were so sick and tired of boys nudging each other and wolf whistling when they climbed on to the bus at 7am. As a young woman you learn very quickly that our breasts don’t really belong to us. And it never stops. I didn’t breastfeed my son for many reasons – mainly because I was in a psychiatric ward, but that’s a different story, for another time – and people still told me I was denying him by not feeding him that milk. “Listen love, I know you’re suicidal and on a lot of medication, but I just wanted to let you know that you’re being a terrible mother by not letting him have those lipids and proteins.” Basically, when it comes to breasts, you’re damned if you do and you’re damned if you don’t. So I wanted to talk about breasts. I wanted to talk about how they are portrayed in films and TV. How there is a platonic ideal of how breasts “should’’ look, and how if you closed your eyes now, I bet you’d be able to see them. There they are, right? Soft, supple, perky, not too big, not too small. The Goldilocks of body parts. I wonder how Goldilocks felt when she got her tits. Probably a bit freaked out and uncomfortable. I wonder if the bears made weird comments about them. Does it make you feel strange that I am talking about the breasts of a fairytale character? Well, women are continually forced to inhabit this icky space between girlhood and womanhood. Be eternally youthful! Be deeply sexual! Our breasts belong to the male gaze, to the strangers on the street who feel an astounding, audacious confidence, as they shout their thoughts on our bodies into our faces, to our sweet children (and I cannot state enough that I fully support every woman in whatever choice she makes when it comes to her body), and of course to capitalism. Yes, your breasts belong to capitalism. Deal with it. But of course, if you choose to make money for yourself by selling your body, you’re scandalous. Channel 4 said I could make a film about breasts. So we gathered some women together and asked them how they felt about theirs. But what we actually ended up talking about was the people in our lives that we loved, the people we had lost. About how our bodies are so much more than separate parts to be categorised, classified and judged. We speculated on how we might feel about ourselves if we hadn’t grown up beneath the microscopic lens of the male gaze – blood red rings around cellulite in magazines, films where the only women worthy of love are thin, white and middle class. We wondered if there was the possibility of a future where we just didn’t have to think about any of it. Where, when we looked down at our bodies, we didn’t dwell on size or flab or those insane phrases made up to make us feel inadequate (have you ever heard a man complain about his saddle bags?). What if, instead, we thought about the people our arms had embraced, the silky heads our hands had lovingly stroked, the miles our legs had walked from the sea to the city, from forests to chalky cliffs? What if we allowed our bodies to elicit the same feeling of warmth and unfathomable safety we got from our mother’s chest? And what if it was her choice whether she breastfed us or not?

2/7/2022,"An elderly gentleman wearing a raincoat and a crumpled tan golf cap ambled across a makeshift stage at dusk on Sunday in Kansas City to accept a trophy that many fans of him have it. Twitter and Facebook did not exist the last time his Cincinnati Bengals won the AFC title and earned a trip to the Super Bowl, but 86-year-old Mike Brown has been a target for years, for running his football team on the cheap.  The Twitter wisecracks kept it up: “My man spoke at the podium like he was wondering how much the Super Bowl was going to cost,” one read. Another read: “You know how much cheaper the flights in are the next day? Let’s just show up the 14th and play then.” That was a good one. The Bengals are to play the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI on 13 February at the Rams’ beautiful new home stadium. The Rams, the designated visiting team in the game, won’t even have to make a road trip. The Bengals’ journey, on the other hand, has taken 33 years. The fans are thrilled to see their team in the Super Bowl, but they are not quite ready to let go of the lean years, which included footing the bill for a new stadium so Brown would not move the team. Days after the Bengals upended Tennessee on 15 January for their first playoff victory in 31 years, an op-ed appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer with the headline: Yes Cincinnati, you owe Bengals owner an apology. Many of those who commented were not kind to the author. “An apology?! I don’t think so,” one reader wrote. “I’m old enough to remember Mike Brown blackmailing the taxpayers of this county to get a new stadium and including an implied warranty that the Bengals would field a more competitive team if one were provided to him. It took the Bengals a quarter of a century to deliver while Mike Brown screwed Cincinnati.” Not only does Brown also serve as the team’s general manager, a la Jerry Jones in Dallas, the Bengals have been reluctant to chase free-agents and have no indoor practice facility in a city where average winter temperatures hover around freezing. The scouting department was thin for years, leading to poor personnel decisions. Former players have weighed in too – and it’s easy to see why Cincinnati may not have been the first choice for big name free-agents down the years. Storytime with T.J. Houshmandzadeh about the early years with the Bengals: No bottled water or Gatorade, jockstrap issues and showing up to home games straight from the club pic.twitter.com/nvSX7STorM “We didn’t have bottled water or Gatorade and when we first got it, guys would be taking bottles of Gatorade home,” former Bengals wide receiverTJ Houshmandzadeh told Colin Cowherd in 2018. “The year before I got there, Willie Anderson was telling me they didn’t even have jockstraps. They would get a bunch of used jockstraps and throw them in the middle of the locker room and say ‘Here you go’”. Add in rotten luck along the way – like when quarterback Carson Palmer, the No 1 overall draft choice in 2003, had his knee caved in as he completed a 66-yard pass, his first in the playoffs. Palmer played in only one other playoff game with the Bengals, losing that one. The Bengals traded away the No overall 1 pick in 1984, which became the five-time Pro Bowler Irving Fryar, and their No 1 overall pick in 1994 was defensive tackle Dan Wilkerson, who forced a trade in 1997 after he called Cincinnatians “prejudiced and uptight and stiff.” The No 1 overall pick in 1995 was the Penn State running back Ki-Jana Carter, who tore up his knee on his third carry in his first preseason game and missed his entire rookie season. Carter would gain all of 747 yards rushing over five injury-plagued seasons with the Bengals. Sixteen years later, quarterback Joe Burrow, the No 1 overall draft choice, had his knee wrecked 10 games into his rookie season. The young head coach, Zac Taylor, won only six of 32 games in his first two years, leading Brown to issue a postseason vote of confidence. But Burrow recovered to post a brilliant second season, the Bengals have rallied under Taylor to win 11 regular-season games and three playoff games, and Cincinnati is saying “Who Dey?” as they did when Boomer Esiason and Ickey Woods led them to Super Bowl XXIII. (The Bengals, who have never won a Super Bowl, lost to the 49ers for the second time.) “When you say the Bengals are going to the Super Bowl, that has a nice ring to it,” Brown said on Sunday after accepting the trophy from Woods, an honorary captain. “Our people in Cincinnati will be ‘Who Deying’ it through the night.” The perception is that Brown, whose late Hall of Fame father, Paul, started and coached the team in 1968, has ceded some of the hands-on operation of the Bengals – though he still attends every practice and game, and next on the organizational flow chart is his daughter, Katie, who has taken several steps to build a better relationship with the community. “I personally am happy for Mike, who never received the credit he deserved for his part in building the last Super Bowl team, and who was incredibly accessible and thoughtful in my many dealings with him in Cincinnati,” Mike Bass, a former Cincinnati sports writer turned occasional columnist, tells the Guardian. “The fans grew to blame him for everything that went wrong after the Super Bowl, and he certainly deserved his share of criticism. “When I was there, for instance, the Bengals relied for a long time on the coaching staff to do a lot of the college scouting instead of hiring more scouts to do it, the way other teams did. When I started writing again for the Enquirer, the fans clearly still were angry at Mike, seeing him as too cheap to build a championship organization or team, same as when I was there. Now? I don’t see Mike’s name come up a lot. The focus now is on Joe Burrow and the team.” Burrow, the unflappable, cigar-smoking, bling-adorned 25-year-old quarterback, provides quite a contrast to Brown – but so did the inimitable former Bengals wide receiver Chad Johnson, who was known for a time as Chad Ochocinco, after his jersey number, 85. Brown, who was born when his father was the 27-year-old football coach at Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, in turn provides quite a contrast to the Rams’ 74-year-old owner, Stan Kroenke. Brown’s estimated worth is a mere $925m, making him the second ‘poorest’ owner in the NFL behind the Raiders’ Mark Davis. Kroenke, worth around $11bn, has amassed a sports empire that includes that gorgeous new stadium near LAX, as well as the Premier League’s Arsenal. The Mike Brown sidebar to the Bengals’ Super Story would be so much cuter had he simply been the famous coach’s son who persisted through years of mediocrity to build a champion the old-fashioned way. This just feels as if the Bengals made it despite the old guy.

2/7/2022,"For a man currently under investigation by the police, Boris Johnson has quite the interest in law and order. Throughout his premiership, the government has used the rhetoric of being “tough on crime” as a pillar of its populist appeal, epitomised by the home secretary, Priti Patel, turning up to a photo-op last year in a personalised police vest. This would be nauseating at the best of times, but when combined with their attempts to curb protest, it has deeply worrying authoritarian undertones. This stance also means the government has little interest in the nuts and bolts of running a humane prison system – which has led to the borderline neglect of the men, women and children who are currently incarcerated. This has been painfully brought to the fore by new figures from the Ministry of Justice which show that the number of people dying behind bars in England and Wales has reached its highest level since current recording practices began. Some 371 people died in prison custody in 2021 – the equivalent of more than one a day. Many of these deaths were coronavirus-related. Tragically, 86 took their own lives, up from 67 the previous year. We may no longer have the death penalty in this country, but people in prison are still dying under the state’s watch.  The prison system has long failed to support those with mental health problems – research in 2019 found that male prisoners are 3.7 times more likely to kill themselves than the wider public – but the pandemic has all too predictably made this worse. Strict coronavirus restrictions in prisons have left tens of thousands of people locked in their cells for 23 hours a day for months on end. Ministers were warned that prisons would become “dangerous Covid-19 hotspots”, and that suicides may increase, but failed to maximise an early release scheme that would have protected as many prisoners as possible. Those left behind have suffered further damage to their mental and physical health. Ministry of Justice data in October last year showed that self-harm rose by 47% among female prisoners in the three months to June 2021, and by a fifth for young people over the course of a year. The death of a baby after a pregnant teenager was left to give birth alone in her cell shows just how brutal conditions in our prisons have become. Prison reform has long been one of those political hot potatoes that few politicians are willing to tackle sensibly, all too aware that they will be accused of being “soft on crime” or “not on the side of victims”. The government’s recent white paper on prisons is evidence of this, boasting that the government will provide 20,000 more prison places to “protect the public”. Consider that the UK already has the third largest prison population in the Council of Europe after Russia and Turkey. Those who are uncomfortable with talk of reducing prison numbers often raise fears that it would let “dangerous criminals off the hook”. But the truth is, flaws in the justice system mean that’s exactly what the current system does. New data shows only 1.3% of rape cases are now going to court despite the number of recorded rapes hitting a record high. The idea that the Tories are the party to be trusted on crime was further discredited last week when the Home Office was caught making misleading claims about the latest crime figures. Instead of reflecting a system working well, incarceration is disproportionately inflicted on people who grew up in poverty, as well as those with mental health conditions and from an ethnic minority; the Prison Reform Trust estimates that the over-representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic people jailed in this country is estimated to fill a dozen extra prisons. What we really need is reform of the entire prison system, starting with an increase in funding for healthcare and palliative support. Not only is it the right thing to do, it will also save taxpayers’ money in the long run by improving prisoners’ health and helping to nurture future rehabilitated citizens. Similarly, we know that investment in rehabilitation keeps the public safer: the “unmitigated disaster” of the Conservative privatisation of probation services led the number of rapes, murders and other serious crimes committed by offenders on parole to rise by more than 50% in just four years. Investing in preventive measures will also keep people out of the criminal justice system in the first place. Prisons are too often used as a solution to social problems; a civilised – and smart – society would spend its resources on tackling poverty rather than building more cells. Alongside prevention strategies, we should radically reduce the size of the prison population – by reducing the imprisonment of non-violent offenders, and focusing on community-based options instead. This is particularly sensible for women, the majority of whom are jailed for non-violent crimes. Imprisoning mothers serving sentences for non-violent offences should end and community women’s centres used instead. Research shows that separating children from their mothers – often for a minor crime and short sentence – puts them at risk of school exclusion, suicide attempts and exploitation. Pregnant women especially have no place in our prisons. The consequences of carrying on as we are clear: experts warn that the government’s plan to expand female prison places could mean that more babies die. As a former public prosecutor, Keir Starmer is in a better position than most to challenge the government to adopt an evidence-based approach to prisons without Johnson being able to accuse him of being “soft” on crime. Justice for victims does not mean the abuse of prisoners, just as law and order cannot be achieved by creating more chaotic lives. Running a nation’s prison system requires more than playing dress-up in a personalised jacket. Perhaps we might begin by remembering that prisoners are still human beings.

2/7/2022,"For nearly three years, Kevin Zhou has worked as a delivery driver in New York City for DoorDash, UberEats, Grubhub and other food delivery apps, and often has to work 12 to 16 hour days just to make enough to make ends meet and support his family. “Sometimes in an order, you can make just $3 to $5 and it can take half an hour,” said Zhou.  He added issues such as traffic and parking tickets, car maintenance, car insurance, gas, other expenses, and being sent by the app on long delivery runs that are out of the way of areas where most orders are concentrated force him and other workers to have to work long hours to make it worthwhile to work the apps. Just a few weeks ago, Zhou got into a car accident while working during a winter storm in New York City, as he said during bad weather is often when the app is the busiest, and he had to pay several hundred dollars in repairs out of his own pocket. “The companies can take 20 to 30% of our earnings, and by myself I don’t have the power to change that, so we need to unite together to fight for our rights,” added Zhou. “We need change and to organize together to fight these big companies.” Zhou is a founding member of the International Alliance of Delivery Workers, one of nine grassroots worker organizations in the New York City area that launching a new coalition, Justice for App Workers, representing 100,000 rideshare and delivery app workers on 1 February and kicking off the new organizing effort with a rally in Foley Square in Manhattan. The coalition is one of the largest organizing campaigns focused on the gig app economy in the US. It held a rally last week in Foley Square New York, where hundreds of workers held banners and protested to highlight their struggles in the gig economy. The coalition comprises of groups including the NYC Rideshare Club, United Delivery Workers Association, International Alliance of Delivery Workers, the Independent Drivers Guild, Long Island Uber & Lyft Network, Black Car Mafia, UzBER, NYC Drivers Unite, and Utany, which represents Spanish-speaking rideshare drivers in the Bronx. The groups are organizing together in demand of living wages, a safe working environment, an end to unfair deactivation, quality healthcare benefits, reliable bathroom access, and the right to form a union for rideshare and delivery app workers, with the aim to expand these demands and organizing efforts around the US. Rideshare and delivery app workers around the US have been pressuring elected officials to rein in the industry’s treatment of workers. The New York City Council passed legislation several months ago to establish minimum pay and guarantee bathroom access for food delivery workers and some regulation efforts have been made over the years, but workers affirm that significant issues remain that they hope to amend through organizing efforts. “We are fighting to transform this industry,” said Naomi Ogutu, who has worked full-time as a rideshare driver for Uber and Lyft since 2016. “We want to take on these multi billion dollar companies that control our lives. We are a big part of the New York economy and we are an important and integral part of New York. We deserve better.” She explained the issues she has faced as a rideshare driver and heard from other drivers over the past several years, such as the apps taking a significant chunk of revenue out of every ride, a lack of security features to protect drivers, a lack of support or fair arbitration in cases of wrongful deactivation of driver accounts, and a lack of paid leave if a driver has any job related issues such as getting assaulted by a passenger. Ogutu also cited a lack of access to bathrooms as a prevalent problem for rideshare drivers in New York City, as she often has to drive far out of her way to find a bathroom she is able to use while on the job. “I close my app to go to the Wegmans supermarket in Brooklyn, that’s where I go to the bathroom. So that’s how I’ve broken my day. That means I’m losing income, because I’m driving across the bridge, going all the way to Brooklyn, just to use a bathroom,” said Ogutu, who is also President of NYC Rideshare Club, which represents around 4,400 rideshare drivers in New York City. Ogutu added: “If you are working and generating billions of dollars for a company, and you can’t even access a bathroom, that’s not fair and it’s not human at all.”",News/US news,"Traffic, tickets, gas: rideshare and delivery app workers fight to unionize",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/rideshare-delivery-app-workers-fight-to-unionize
2/7/2022,"Let’s start with a multiple choice question. It is a cold, wet February evening. You come home with your two kids after school. You stand in the hallway and contemplate your options. Do you put on the heating? It is freezing and your kids are reluctant to take off their coats. Perhaps you should make a cheap but nutritious dinner for them. They have been saying all the way home that they are “starving”. You could give them their night-time bath, because it is two days since they had their last one, or save the cost of the heating for some new winter boots – theirs are too tight and letting in water. You can pick only one option.  When energy bills increase for millions in April, these decisions will become a stark reality for many. According to the thinktank the Resolution Foundation, the number of households living in “fuel stress” will rise by 2.5 million to 5 million. This is a staggering number to comprehend, so please think of your neighbours, your auntie, your best friend, your favourite teacher from school who might be in that position. As for the measures announced by the government on Thursday to ameliorate the effects of the rise in the energy price cap, the words “too little, too late” and “poorly thought‑out” spring to mind. Perhaps I should be writing this from a clear-eyed, journalistic point of view, but in fact I am writing this from a place of fury. You see, I grew up in extreme poverty. I know only too well the absolute degradation and hardship of poverty – particularly fuel poverty – when home isn’t a home, but a place that you avoid as long as possible, lingering in shopping centres or libraries, where you can stay warm for a little longer. “It was just so warm and cosy. Our bed was right by the radiator.” This is what my mum always said when she recalled the women’s shelter we ended up in not long after I was born. For many, it wouldn’t be something worth mentioning, but if you have grown up poor – and in the cold, hard granite of Aberdeen, no less – warmth is memorable. Indeed, my grandmother and her sisters used to go down to the docks in their childhood to scavenge lumps of coal, earning the name “Torry seagulls”, after the working-class area where they grew up. I sometimes imagine that cold passing down through slow-moving blood, generation to generation, woman to woman. That is three generations for whom sleeping next to a radiator that you don’t worry about paying for is an anecdote worth repeating over and over, throughout your life, like meeting a celebrity. After the women’s shelter, there was an unfurnished, uncarpeted council flat that no one wanted on a street no one would choose to live on. My single mum and I had only a coal fire. As a mum to a 15-month-old boy, I cannot imagine the stress of building a fire, keeping it going and ensuring it was safe. Or of lugging the coal up the front steps with a baby and a buggy. When I was a toddler, I came running through to tell my mum I had run a bath. I had filled our tub with coal. I understood that was where warmth came from, but not how. After that council house, we moved around a lot, up and down the country, taking in Kent, Durham, Lancashire and East Anglia. We lived in homeless B&Bs, bedsits, council houses and slum private rentals. I think there were about 16 places – possibly more, but I lost count. One thing they all had in common was brutal, biting cold. We measured and rationed water for bathing, wore clothes as long as we possibly could before washing them. Often, there were no facilities to do so anyway. As a child, I came to know what it was to be constantly cold, even as you slept. Even a duvet could feel wet, heavy and hopeless. In one childhood council flat, we had ice inside the windows; I used to say: “Jack Frost has been.” At night, I would lie in bed and draw shapes with my fingertip in the black mould on the wall – council-estate kid Etch A Sketch. In a B&B my sister, my mum and I shared, the metal bunk beds would get icy to the touch. There was a meter in the communal showers. If we didn’t have a 20p piece, we couldn’t have a shower. Often, that money was days away. At school, I was often told I was smelly. For years, I believed it was because kids were cruel and I was always the strange new girl with the falling-apart shoes and the free school dinners. But I now realise that, since we got to shower only twice a week and we never had the money to wash our clothes regularly, I did probably stink, especially as I reached puberty. When I got my period at 13 – such an acutely self-conscious age – I begged my mum for a bath each night, but I had to settle for a cold sink wash and, when the night came, the thirdhand bath water. In one bedsit, when I was in my teens and adept at gallows humour, I joked to my mum that maybe we could eat the mushrooms growing out of our damp bathroom carpet. She said: “Don’t be daft,” as though I had been serious and that was an entirely normal thing to suggest. I cannot remember a warm home in the winter from my youth. Instead, I recall my mum, my sister and I crowded around small fires, like characters in a Dickens novel, after showers, to change our clothes, to eat, to read. It didn’t matter whether we had a whole council flat, a bedsit or a single room: all our lives and activity took place within the two square metres’ warmth of that heater. Except, of course, we weren’t Dickensian characters. I grew up in the 80s and 90s. Even more reprehensibly, these scenes are still being repeated three decades later. Growing up in this way told me I didn’t matter, that society didn’t think I was worth even the most basic provisions. I truly believed – well into adulthood – that I had done something wrong to deserve it. That somehow I was lesser or bad. That was why, when I went to better-off friends’ houses, I could take off my shoes and feel warm carpet under my feet. It was why we sat on top of their Groovy Chick duvets and didn’t huddle under them, wearing two jumpers. Now that I have a child of my own, I often think about that first flat, with its bare floorboards and coal fire. Unthinkable even in the 80s. My boy was born in Prague at the height of the pandemic during a winter of heavy snow. When people came into our small apartment, they would declare it almost tropical, shedding layers as they walked from the front door to the living room. They would look at me questioningly: “Aren’t you boiling? Can I crack a window?” I would shrug, hold my baby close to me and say: “I just really can’t take the cold.” Lowborn: Growing Up, Getting Away and Returning to Britain’s Poorest Towns by Kerry Hudson is out now (Chatto, £8.99).

2/7/2022,"From Wings of Desire to Run Lola Run, from Cate Shortland’s Berlin Syndrome to one-take wonder Victoria, quite a few film-makers have been seduced by the liberating possibilities of the German capital. But too much freedom can often equate to directionless freestyling – and the authority-resistant, hard-partying, gender-fluid spirit of Berlin goes straight to the head of Irish writer-director Samuel Kay Forrest in this rambling and cringingly earnest feature debut. Forrest plays wandering soul Angus, a twentysomething with a side-shave haircut and a thorny family background set on finding himself in the capital of Euro-hedonism. When he’s not railing against fascism and scarpering from the polizei, or oh-so-seditiously spray-painting his tag “HipBeat” around town, he has a budding relationship with local woman Angie (Marie Céline Yildirim). She’s unaware, though, that he’s sleeping around with members of both sexes – and, after a pep talk with an inspirational drag queen, becoming more intent on exploring the parts of himself in between.  For a film about searching and transition, too much of this identity crisis is baldly spelled out through voiceover, with Angus’s interior monologue prone to such zingers as: “We’ve all got scars. Yeah – I’ve got a few.” Only once does Forrest, rather than the obvious approach, grapple in properly dramatised form with gender and sexuality: during a 13-minute, single-cut scene in which Angus nervously reveals his new incarnation to Angie. It’s a bold gambit; though over-elongated, this vignette engages far more plausibly with the issues of judgment and acceptance. Most of the time, though, HipBeat can’t rouse itself to be much more than a mood piece – even as it nominally counts down to a climactic Kreuzberg street protest. Despite the added charge from these scenes being shot in real life, its political ideas are stuck in an embarrassing studenty register: “I feel a beat in the street as I look at the city. A change is coming.” It’s on firmer ground – backed up by Joshua Monroe’s attuned urban cinematography and a choice outing for Mr Flagio’s Italo-disco classic Take a Chance – when arguing how change is ultimately rooted in a personal revolution.

2/7/2022,"The number of Americans dying while homeless has surged dramatically in the past five years, an exclusive analysis by the Guardian in conjunction with an academic expert at the University of Washington has shown. An examination of 20 US urban areas found the number of deaths among people living without housing shot up by 77% in the five years ending in 2020.  The rise from 2016 through 2020 was driven by many factors, including ever-rising numbers of people living on the street and the growing dangers they face, such as violence, untreated disease and increasingly deadly illicit drug supplies. From 65-year-old Randy Ferris, killed when a car veered into a California sidewalk encampment, Justine Belovoskey, 60, who died alone in a tent during a Texas cold snap, and Anthony Denico Williams, stabbed to death at age 20 in Washington DC, to scores of young people succumbing to overdoses on the streets, their stories reflect the harrowing tragedy of an epidemic of homelessness. “People who die while experiencing homelessness are some of the most neglected in society,” said Matt Fowle, University of Washington researcher and co-creator of the organization Homeless Deaths Count. “These are folks who most need our help and are least likely to receive it.” Coronavirus was just one more hazard people struggling on the streets and in shelters faced in the last two years. While the federal government makes no effort to count deaths nationally of people deemed homeless, the Guardian worked with Fowle to collect local data from large urban areas, where consistent year-to-year counts were available. The stark results stretch from Los Angeles and Seattle to New York, Philadelphia and Miami, via the heartland. The Guardian’s analysis counted 18,000 people who died homeless over five years in encampments, on sidewalks or in shelters, including 5,000 deaths in 2020 alone. In most cases, the deaths were tracked by county coroners and medical examiners, but in a few locations only local nonprofits kept track. Experts at the nonprofit National Health Care for the Homeless Council say that, in many places, the people who perish without housing are never counted. They estimate the total number of deaths is actually between 17,000 and 40,000 every year. “Every person and every life matters,’’ said the council’s Katherine Cavanaugh. “That’s part of why we are encouraging people to just track these deaths. We want to make sure that we can use that information to improve situations for people in the future and not have these deaths be happening in vain.” In all but two of the 20 cities or counties examined by the Guardian, numbers rose significantly over five years. For instance, the homeless death toll in Los Angeles almost doubled to more than 1,600 in 2020 from 871 in 2016, while New York’s total more than doubled to 685 from 290. In places that listed causes of death, the most prevalent have plagued homeless populations for years: drug overdoses, violence, traffic deaths and premature lethality of treatable conditions like heart disease. Only New York and Los Angeles noted a large number of deaths caused by Covid-19. The overall jump in deaths may reflect both increases in the sheer number of unhoused people but also, disproportionately, the growing dangers they face. The annual count of the nation’s homeless population was postponed in 2021 due to the pandemic, but counts for previous years showed a disheartening trend: after declining for years, the homeless population increased steadily between 2016 and 2020. And more people who find themselves without a home are living outside, in unsheltered conditions, a factor that was exacerbated by shelter closures in the pandemic. They also suffer the toll of increasingly deadly synthetic street drugs, including fentanyl. Many may have faced the kind of societal headwinds encountered by 26-year-old Christopher Madson-Yamasaki of Oregon, a bright, aspiring renewable energy technician with a mischievous grin, who had struggled with schizoaffective disorder since his teenage years, his family said. He had become addicted to methamphetamines, after falling off his medication routine and self-medicating. He and his mother repeatedly sought to get him treatment around Portland. But in the end, there were no doors open for him. He was found in a tent 27 February 2020, dead of a meth overdose and with all his valuables stolen from him, days after being kicked out of a shelter for smoking on a balcony, according to his mother, Hope Yamasaki. Yamasaki told the Guardian how Christopher fell through the cracks. She described how he had repeatedly been turned away from drug treatment centers, because they couldn’t handle those with mental illness, and from mental health programs, because they couldn’t take those with addiction problems. When he turned 26, Madson-Yamasaki no longer qualified for youth programs that had previously provided housing. “And he didn’t make it to 27,” said his mother. “This is so hard to talk about, but it’s so important. So many members of our community are dehumanized for mental health and addiction issues. They matter.” Officials of Multnomah county, which provides health services for Madson-Yamasaki’s region, held a press conference featuring his story to highlight the need for more specialized treatment, which they hope to provide with recently approved new funding. “We know that there is a lot more to be done,” said Multnomah county chair Deborah Kafoury. People without a home face three times the risk of death of the general population, according to a local analysis of 2017 to 2019 deaths by Los Angeles county health department’s center for health impact evaluation. It found homeless people in LA were 35 times more likely to die of drug or alcohol overdose, 16 times more likely to die of traffic-related injuries, such as being hit by a car, and 14 times more likely to be the victim of homicide. In 2020, drug overdose deaths were the top cause of death among homeless people in every urban area that reported causes. “It’s deadlier to have a substance use disorder now,” said Liz Hersh director of Philadelphia’s office of homeless services, who said fentanyl, which is as much as 100 times as potent as heroin, is a huge driver of increased overdose deaths. Methamphetamine was also a factor in many deaths. Jennifer Vines, health officer of Multnomah county, said people living outside sometimes report taking the stimulant at night because they fear violence. “We often hear anecdotally that people will start using meth as a way of staying alert to protect themselves and their belongings,” she said. “And then, the flip side of that is it can also lead to psychosis and erratic and violent behavior.” Hersh of Philadelphia, where homeless deaths doubled over five years, also noted rising trends in overdoses and violence since coronavirus arrived, even though its homeless population decreased. “We’re seeing some of the frustration and rage that the pandemic has engendered,” she said. “People are despairing.” In Las Vegas on 13 July 2020, Brent Michael Lloyd, 48 and unhoused, was shot in the head while he slept outside, in what police described as a “thrill killing”. Anthony Denico Williams, 20, lost his mother to cancer at age 16 and ended up regularly sleeping under the neoclassical arches of Washington DC’s Union station railway hub. He dreamed of opening a home for youth in need. Asked what he would do with three wishes, he said he’d want “a house over my head, to be able to give back to others and to have a nice job, that’s it.” Instead Williams was knifed to death 26 January 2020, in an altercation over a drug sale. A friend, social worker Grace McKinnon, told a local TV station that his death seemed senseless. “So young, he still had his life ahead of him. And for it to end like this, I don’t know if there’s meaning in that.” Homeless people are at greater risk of being hit by cars, according to numerous officials, particularly where large numbers are living under bridges or beside freeway off-ramps. Randy Ferris, a vietnam war veteran, was one of three men killed on 15 March 2021 when a driver veered into an encampment under a San Diego bridge. Amber Joseph, who recently got housing, spoke at a memorial about how Ferris had helped her navigate living on the streets. “He was like a big brother to me. He kept a close eye on me,” the Times of San Diego reported her saying. Deaths from exposure make up a relatively small fraction of reported deaths, according to several homelessness experts, perhaps because the coldest cities have programs to get people indoors in winter. But Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Sacramento regional coalition to end homelessness, said his normally temperate area of northern California, where 70% of the homeless population live outside, has seen more people dying of hypothermia in unusual weather events. “I think it’s just so many more people outside exposed to the elements,” he said. “And the elements are somewhat more unpredictable than they might have been in the past. Sadly, really terrible storms and fires are the new normal.” The climate crisis is driving more extreme weather events across the US. During the exceptional cold snap that gripped Texas last winter, leaving millions without power, Justine Belovoskey, 60, perished of hypothermia in her tent in a state-sanctioned homeless encampment on 15 February. She didn’t make it to a warming center with a diesel generator, according to the Texas Observer. In Denver, Colorado, the cold certainly killed people living outside, but disease and injury caused more deaths, while drug overdoses far exceeded other causes, Axios reported, citing local reports. Beyond the direct medical causes, factors such as widespread lack of affordable housing drive increases in homelessness and, ultimately, deaths, experts say. Those jurisdictions that reported the genders of those who died typically found that about three-quarters were men. Racial trends were hard to establish, based on the few reports that included racial breakdowns. Sacramento, California, for example, reported that 41% of those dying while homeless were people of color. The average age of death for people without housing is low. Again in Sacramento county, for instance, it was 51 for men and 49 for women. “Basically, on average, homelessness takes off 25% of a person’s life,” said Erlenbusch. Preventable and treatable diseases, including heart disease and diabetes, are among the biggest causes of premature homeless deaths. “People should be dying of these illnesses when they are 95, not when they’re 48,” said Margot Kushel, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and director of its center for vulnerable populations. It may be some time before the true effects of Covid-19 on this population are known. The biggest surge in coronavirus deaths nationally didn’t come until January 2021, which isn’t yet included in most jurisdictions’ homelessness data. New York City, which recently disclosed deaths among people experiencing homelessness for the fiscal year ending July 2020, found that there were 121 deaths from Covid-19, mostly among those living in city-funded shelters. That made Covid the second highest cause of the 613 recorded homeless deaths that year. Los Angeles’s unhoused have suffered several hundred Covid deaths, Will Nicholas, director of LA county’s center for health impact evaluation, said preliminary figures suggested. And the pandemic probably worsened overdose deaths across the board. “It’s a sad situation,” Nicholas said. Experts agreed that the best prescription is to house people. “You cannot have a healthy society with this many people living on the economic and social margins,” said UCSF’s Kushel. “Homelessness is lethal. We’re not going to be able to solve this without solving homelessness.” For UW researcher Fowle, who is working on a doctoral thesis about the crisis of US homeless deaths, it comes down to whether our society can muster the empathy to act. “It’s a tragedy that people are dying without housing,” he said. “We know the solutions. Housing saves lives and, for these people, is often a form of health care.”",News/US news,‘Homelessness is lethal’: US deaths among those without housing is surging,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/07/homelessness-is-lethal-deaths-have-risen-dramatically
2/7/2022,"Environmental concerns have motivated the animation giant Studio Ghibli since its salad days: Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (made pre-Ghibli but now absorbed into its canon) and Pom Poko are among those which imagine climate disaster. The studio reached a peak of cinematic sophistication with Princess Mononoke, Hayao Miyazaki’s 1997 fable about a dying prince drawn into the struggle between nature and civilisation in ancient Japan. Humans battle gods; limbs and heads are severed. Meanwhile, the placid kodama (tree spirits) look on. Their naive, ghostly faces rotate slowly, accompanied by a tick-tick-ticking sound like time running out. Ryan Gilbey  Equal parts rapper and digital-age activist, Chicago’s Noname has frequently used her work to be outspoken about social issues. With her jazzy-yet-sombre 2021 single Rainforest, she critiques billionaire capitalism, consumerism and anti-Blackness as a young radical, desperately trying to make change while also wanting to cling to some remaining sense of pleasure in a world on fire: “A rainforest cries / Everybody dies a little / I just wanna dance tonight”. A sentiment to which many of us can relate, it is a climate crisis anthem that points its fingers in some pretty shrewd directions. Jenessa Williams When it was first published in 1826, Mary Shelley’s The Last Man did not get the favourable notices of her earlier novel Frankenstein. It was derided as the product of a “diseased” imagination, perhaps that was because the premise seemed far-fetched. After all, who could possibly believe in a world where there was not only a global pandemic, but also climate meltdown and apocalyptic flooding? Now, of course, it feels eerily prescient, even if plenty of its other details are clearly stuck in the 19th century. It’s an wildly inventive and pioneering investigation into humanity’s precarious relationship with nature – and still more fascinating as it also provides a thinly veiled history of the author’s tragically deceased husband, the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. Sam Jordison Climate breakdown is often used as set-dressing for post-apocalyptic stories, but few games have applied much creative thinking to what to actually do about the most pressing and terrifying issue of our times. But when it feels overwhelming, Alba: A Wildlife Adventure reminds us that even if we can’t personally stop the world’s corporate polluters, we can at least make a difference in our communities. Set on a Spanish island, this soothing, family-friendly game stars a little girl trying to stop a luxury hotel from being built on a wildlife reserve, photographing birds and picking up rubbish with admirable determination and idealism. Keza MacDonald This is what winter looked like, once – a world swathed in snow and ice, from the thick white village street to distant frozen mountains. It is a picture of a world we are losing all the time, as ice caps and Alpine glaciers recede and forest fires become more “normal” than snow globe winters. With Hunters in the Snow (1565), Pieter Bruegel painted the planet before industry, when people lived in nature and the climate was something that happened to us rather than being changed by us. Life may have been tough but it was also full of pleasure and wonder, as the skaters know. If the crisis isn’t reversed, this painting will be a monument to all we have destroyed.

2/7/2022,"A care worker at a hotel used to relieve pressure on NHS beds has claimed vulnerable people have been “failed”, with problems including stinking clinical waste being stored in a bathtub and a lack of accessible showers. Lesley Horn, who worked in the the Future Inn hotel in Plymouth for two months told the Guardian she feared people were being “warehoused” in temporary care hotels, which health officials have been instructed to use amid an acute shortage of care packages.  More than 500 care homes are closed to new admissions because of outbreaks of Covid among residents and many more closed because of staff testing positive. There are also shortages of homecare workers so “care hotels” have been set up in places including Bristol, Norwich and Newquay. But there are rising concerns about their suitability. Horn said a bathroom on the residents’ floor was periodically used as an overflow for clinical waste with bin bags filled with faeces and urine-soiled materials stacked up. “You can imagine – you open the door and it was oh, my God, you are kidding me?” she said. “The smell. And this was not according to the infection control guidelines. It’s not on.” Current NHS England guidance states that care hotels are supposed to be used for “days, rather than weeks” but Horn, who worked at the Plymouth hotel from late October to early January, said some residents stayed as long as two months. Care hotels are not regulated as care homes by the Care Quality Commission regulator, but they are recorded as locations where domiciliary care is being provided. CQC is currently undertaking a risk-based inspection of the Plymouth hotel. Horn said there were only two walk-in showers for more than 30 of the residents and these were located on a different floor to their rooms. She alleged there were not always enough hospital-style beds and there was sometimes a lack of appropriate equipment such as commodes. Devon NHS clinical commissioning group, Plymouth city council and the private operator, Abicare, defended the arrangements, said they did not agree with some of Horn’s claims and said “safety and quality of care are always our main priorities”. They conceded there had been issues with a waste contractor, but said these were now solved and patient care was unaffected. They denied equipment shortages and said it was normal for hospital patients to walk a short distance to access a shower. Long stays were only in a very few cases where, because of homelessness or safeguarding concerns, discharge was difficult. “Feedback from the people who have used the centre has been overwhelmingly positive and staff have been touched by the many cards and messages,” said Darryn Allcorn, Devon’s lead chief nurse, and Craig McArdle, strategic director for people at the council. “The care hotel is just one of the many measures health and care partners have put in place to support the city’s main hospital during a period of unprecedented pressure when capacity in the care sector is challenged by the effects of the pandemic.” The need to accelerate the discharge of hospital patients has been acute. Derriford hospital in Plymouth recently declared a level 4 alert, which means patient safety could be compromised. But domiciliary care operators have warned that “care hotels … may not be equipped to meet [the] needs” of older and disabled people. “It should never have come to this,” said Jane Townson, the chief executive of the Homecare Association. “We call on the government to invest properly in home-based support and care, so we can enable people to live well at home … take pressure off the NHS and reduce costs for the health and care system.” Last month the daughter of a resident at a care hotel in Bristol complained her father hadn’t been seen by a nurse for a week. Linda Slade told the BBC: “He has a stoma bag, they didn’t know anything about stoma bags or what to do.” Kate Terroni, CQC’s chief inspector of adult social care said the regulator would “engage providers to ensure high quality care for people in these settings” and “inspect in response to concerns”. Horn, who has worked in healthcare for 40 years, said conditions of some residents being discharged were worse than she would usually see in care settings. Health officials countered that all discharges had been deemed medically appropriate. Horn said it felt as though people were being “warehoused” and said: “They are put in our hands to give them the best care we can and this is where I feel we were put in a corner … It was difficult for us.” The providers said these were the opinions of one person but that they strongly disagreed with them. Most rooms had conventional baths, which are not accessible to many people in care settings, but there were two walk-in showers on the fourth floor, one in a room stacked so high with furniture that it was impossible to turn the main light on, Horn said. It required care staff to take residents up in a lift, usher them through the darkened room and give them a shower. “It’s horrible,” Horn said. “This isn’t the type of environment you take somebody in.” The Department of Health and Social Care said it had made £3.3bn available to assist timely hospital discharge since the pandemic began, with funding due to continue until March.",News/Society,NHS ‘care hotels’ spark concerns after report of clinical waste in bath,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/07/care-hotels-clinical-waste-nhs-beds-pandemic
2/7/2022,"People should consider boycotting the comedian Jimmy Carr because of his widely criticised comment about the Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities in a Netflix special, the UK health secretary, Sajid Javid, has suggested. Carr has been condemned by groups including the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Auschwitz Memorial and Hope Not Hate for comments he made in the His Dark Material section of his show.  Carr joked about the horror of “6 million Jewish lives being lost” before suggesting the deaths of “the thousands of Gypsies” at the hands of the Nazis had been one of “the positives” of the Holocaust. Asked about the comments, Javid told Times Radio they were “horrid”. He added: “I think we all have a right to react to that. And one of the best ways anyone can react to that is show these platforms, what they think about Jimmy Carr by not watching or listening to him, and that will send him a very strong message.” The Netflix show was released on Christmas Day but received widespread attention on Friday after a clip was posted and shared online. In the special, Carr sought to explain what he said was the context of the joke, saying it was “edgy as hell” and had an educational value. “It’s a joke about the worst thing that’s ever happened in human history, and people say ‘never forget’, well this is how I remember,” he said. “There is an educational quality. Like everyone in the room knows, 6 million Jewish people lost their lives to the Nazis during the second world war. But a lot of people don’t know, because it’s not really taught in our schools, that the Nazis also killed, in their thousands, Gypsies, homosexuals, disabled people and Jehovah’s Witnesses.” On Saturday, the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, suggested new legislation could prevent the broadcast of such comments, telling BBC One Breakfast that they were “abhorrent and they just shouldn’t be on television”. She said: “We are looking at legislation via the media bill, which would bring into scope those comments from other video-on-demand streaming outlets like Netflix.”",News/Politics,"Boycott Jimmy Carr over ‘horrid’ joke about Roma people, says Sajid Javid",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/07/boycott-jimmy-carr-over-horrid-joke-about-roma-people-says-sajid-javid
