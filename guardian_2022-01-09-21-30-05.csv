1/9/2022,"A momentous week of diplomacy is about to get under way in Europe, with the fate of Ukraine, hemmed in by 100,000 Russian troops, hanging in the balance. Senior diplomats from the US and Russia will meet in Geneva on Sunday and Monday to discuss Moscow’s demands, set out last month in two draft treaties, one with the US and one with Nato. Much of their content is unacceptable to Washington and the alliance, most importantly a pledge that Ukraine will never be a Nato member.  The Biden administration insists that sovereign states’ right to apply for Nato membership is non-negotiable. Nor are US troop deployments in Europe, administration officials have stressed on the eve of the talks. They said, however, that Washington would discuss other security guarantees, such as mutual limits on missile deployments on the continent. That would fall far short of the comprehensive changes Moscow is demanding. Few if any diplomatic observers expect a quick deal to resolve the crisis this week, but the opposite - a complete breakdown - is possible. It should quickly become apparent whether Russia is interested in negotiating over its proposals or whether they were designed to be rejected, creating a pretext for a war Vladimir Putin has already decided on. “Lower your expectations and then lower them some more,” said Melinda Haring, the deputy director of the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council. “Watch Moscow’s demands in the meetings. If Russia insists that Nato cannot expand ever again, we will know that Moscow is preparing for war in Ukraine, since this is a red line for the west.” The two sides in Geneva will be led by veteran negotiators, the US deputy secretary of state, Wendy Sherman, and her Russian counterpart, Sergei Ryabkov, accompanied by senior officials from their respective defence departments and militaries. The negotiations are scheduled to begin on Monday, but officials said there would be a less formal meeting between the two delegations on Sunday evening. US officials insist that Sherman and her team will only discuss the bilateral elements of Russia’s proposals, and not anything in which other countries have a sovereign stake. The mantra to Kiev and Nato capitals is: “Nothing about you without you.” The negotiating teams will move to Brussels on Wednesday for a session of the Nato-Russia Council, in which all 30 alliance members will take part. It will be the first such meeting since 2019 of the council, which was established in 2002 to defuse tensions and build consensus. The next day there will be a meeting in Vienna of the permanent council of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), chaired by Poland. Representatives will be on a more junior, ambassadorial level than the Nato session the previous day. It will, however, be imbued with particular significance because it will include non-Nato European states such as Finland and Sweden, who are contemplating their future in light of Russia‘s pressure on Ukraine. Finnish leaders in particular have hinted heavily in the past few days they might look anew at Nato membership. “We believe that after bilateral talks with the United States and then the Nato format, it is possible that in this wider forum, some developments are possible,” Nikodem Rachoń, the spokesman for the Polish embassy in Warsaw, said. Washington says the US-Russia meeting in Geneva will primarily be an opportunity to present positions rather than resolve them. “On Monday we will listen to Russia explain its proposals and the underlying concerns motivating them. We will respond and share our own concerns,” a senior administration official said. “Hopefully it will result in identifying a few bilateral issues where there is enough common ground to continue discussions.” It is not clear whether either Sherman or Ryabkov have been empowered to put new ideas on the table. “They will talk about the Russian posture, they will talk about stability,” said a European diplomat briefed on US preparations. “They will talk about the Russian demands and explain why they’re not acceptable, and they will lay out some queries of our own about European stability and Russian actions.” Sherman is also expect to list the costs to Russia if it goes ahead with military action in Ukraine, including sweeping financial sanctions, possibly cutting it off from the international electronic payments system, Swift, and limits on its citizens’ ability to buy western technology. According to the New York Times, the chairman of the US joint chief of staff, Gen Mark Milley, has also warned his Russian counterpart, Gen Valery Gerasimov, that an invasion would face a long insurgency, backed by advanced US weaponry. US officials have refused to comment on reports that Stinger anti-aircraft missiles were being sent to Ukraine in anticipation of such a guerrilla war. “This week’s diplomacy is critical. From a certain moment it was clear that the West would not say an outright ‘no’ to Moscow’s proposal because too much was at stake. The question was, how far Washington and Europeans are ready to go with the talks,” said Andrey Baklitskiy, a senior research fellow at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. Russia’s rushed military intervention in Kazakhstan has thrown another wild card onto the table, but Baklitskiy does not expect any impact on the Ukraine crisis. “There is no direct link between Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Even the people handling the issue in Russia are different except for the very top,” he said. Others say it is too early to tell whether the uprising and the response will unnerve or embolden the Kremlin. “To what extent are the Russians worried about Kazakhstan or believe they can manage it? I don’t think we have a feel for that yet,” one European diplomat said. If there is wiggle room at all in this week’s negotiations, it could come in one of a handful of categories. The Biden administration and Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, have ruled out bowing to Russian demands to preclude Ukraine’s membership of the alliance, but some analysts say that leaves open the possibility of a compromise, in which the theoretical possibility of membership is asserted at the same time as a clear statement that there would be many obstacles to overcome and so would not happen in the near future. That may be palatable in Washington and Nato capitals, but it may well not be enough for Putin. “Frankly, I’d be surprised if it was,” the European diplomat said. “Given their demands I think they prefer to have the issue not addressed at all. Otherwise it shows they haven’t got their demand about Ukraine not joining Nato written down.” Another area of possible compromise is on the deployment of forces. The Russian proposals call for the withdrawal of US forces from Nato’s eastern flank, where they were sent after Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea, and a guarantee that no intermediate-range nuclear capable missiles would be deployed on European soil. The proposals did not offer reciprocal moves by Russia to pull back its troops from the Ukrainian border region or withdraw its own missiles. That could be an area for negotiation. Russia has expressed concerns about the possibility of offensive weapons, such as missiles capable of reaching Moscow, being deployed in Ukraine. Washington has said it has no intention of taking such a step. “Putin could go back and say we’ve been assured that there’s no imminent admission of Ukraine to Nato and we have assurances there will be no strike weapons - combat aircraft, missiles - or US bases in Ukraine,” said Rajan Menon, a political scientist at the City University of New York. “But will Russians insist that this be put in writing? That’s the sticky part.” The most severe limiting factor in the negotiations could turn out to be the political constraints on the main parties. “If you look at the polarisation here, it suggests that we have no bandwidth on the US side to actually do anything, sue for peace, let alone come up with a treaty or series of treaties,” said Fiona Hill, a former senior director for European and Russian affairs on the US National Security Council. “Putin has his own time frame of elections in 2024, and he wants to have something to show because his own popularity is lagging somewhat.” The deployment of so many troops and the Kremlin’s rhetoric have set high Russian expectations of what would constitute a satisfactory outcome from the week’s diplomacy. Officials in Moscow have insisted that nothing short of “legally formulated guarantees of security” would be enough to pull back the troops from the Ukrainian border. “Putin has put himself in a position where he has to come back with something, without looking really weak,” Menon said. “​​Given the political realities now, am I confident that a deal is going to happen? No, not at all. I think it’s going to be very, very dicey.”",News/World news,Ukraine’s fate hangs in balance as ‘critical’ week of talks begins,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/09/ukraine-fate-hangs-in-balance-as-critical-week-of-talks-begins
1/9/2022,"As 2022 begins, after nearly two years of isolation and restrictions of various kinds, people are desperate to reach out and connect. Giving time, energy and attention to something that makes the world a better place is rewarding for ourselves and the “recipients” – but it also comes loaded with ethical pitfalls and muddy motivations. If we’re all to begin 2022 with a full plate of activities and a clean conscience, I want to consider the best way of approaching volunteering. I began doing outreach work in prisons, arts charities, detention centres and asylum seekers’ resource centres in 2012 and my fifth book, Asylum and Exile: Hidden Voices, was an account of some of that work. It bothers me that in the seven years since it came out, the trials and privations of the many people I worked with have only grown worse. The debate has become more toxic and provisions are ever more meagre. Recently I contributed to Refugee Tales: Volume IV, a collection of refugee testimonies included in The Walk festival, when Little Amal walked across Europe.  In a caring society that supports everyone who needs it, there should never have to be a need for a “third sector” that is constantly working to fundraise and consciousness-raise, reach out to the needy, provide vital services and rely on the kindness and motivation of strangers to improve conditions and provide essential help. The last couple of years have exacerbated injustices and equalities that were already there, while political messaging around refugees and forced migration has grown ever more bitter over the last decade. I’m constantly contacted by people who are appalled by the hostility and divisiveness – or even the plain ignorance – they see parroted in so many public debates. They tell me they just want to help, however they can. First, let me say that this type of work is truly rewarding. I work with people on acting, performing, visual documenting and journalism skills, but these disciplines are really just a way into the human experience of meeting experienced and fascinating strangers from all over the world and all walks of life, of being in a room together, working together, communicating and usually laughing and joking the hours away. The reward comes not from witnessing results but from being in the moment, forming a group and feeling the liveliness move from one person to another; noticing people really listen to each other, support each other, respectfully critique each other and work together. You don’t need to produce something to achieve something, you can all just be concentrating, doing an activity, once or twice a week. However, potential volunteers don’t always arrive with clear hearts and in the last decade I’ve seen plenty of fakers come and go. Those who are scintillated by being inside a prison and gain some kind of frisson from telling everyone else about it; those who inveigle their way into the trust of traumatised and desperate people to “get their story” and produce artworks inspired by them to help their own careers; those who appear as meek and mild helpers but grow petulant when they don’t become stars or power-holders within the enterprise they’re volunteering at; those who patronise and stereotype; the entitled ones who say they want to help others, but only on a Tuesday between 3.10pm and 4.30pm, and who then cancel or change their availability (or don’t show up) according to how they feel. For people who want to start 2022 by matching their good intentions with genuinely beneficial actions, I’ve come up with some general principles of volunteering that will make a tangible difference. It’s not useful to think of oneself simply as a socially aware person who’s willing to just do anything for anyone – any charity, any cause, it doesn’t matter, as long as it helps. It’s much more constructive to research and approach some initiatives, large or small, whose work you have learned about and are interested in, whose services are clearly streamlined and whose locations are convenient for you. Once you’ve chosen some, contact them and offer specific skills that you yourself have developed to excellence. Don’t give the person answering the phone or email the extra work of coming up with stuff for you to do or suggesting solutions by saying you’ll do “whatever you need”. It’s arrogant, not humble, to suggest that. Charities and social equality initiatives of all kinds tend to have similar needs and similar weak points. Be led by your education, training, natural proficiency and professional experience, rather than any romantic notions or saintly visions of yourself randomly doing good for grateful recipients. Charities are desperate for committed, quality people who can provide reliable legal advice, medical or general health advice, physical therapy of any kind, admin and secretarial work, accountancy and financial advice, form-filling assistance and bureaucratic knowledge. If you are not qualified or experienced at working with young at-risk children, don’t. If you aren’t qualified or experienced as a professional trauma therapist or grief counsellor, don’t. Volunteering is not an opportunity for you to try out fantasy versions of yourself. Instead of thinking of yourself as a volunteer who drops in for a couple of hours a week to help out, think of it more as pro bono work with surgery hours and a set timescale of six months or a year. In your own head you are donating time for free away from your real life, but everyone you deal with within the project will regard you as a professional who works there. Be as professional as you would be in your “real job” in terms of timekeeping, consistency, behaviour and responsibility. Finally … if you are an excellent cook of nutritious, savoury food, then local community services will love you forever. You may be giving people their one proper meal of the day, you’ll be able to train others and there’s no better place than a kitchen to foster cooperation, conviviality and community. To find the best match for your skill set, schedule and interests, there are a few national organisations with long histories of matching volunteers to local groups and charities. Do It is an online platform that can verify your identity and introduce you to volunteering opportunities nearby. Volunteering Matters has branches in Scotland and Wales and links with Europe, and the Royal Voluntary Service started as the Women’s Voluntary Services during the second world war. The RVS has strong links to volunteering to support the NHS. We Are NCS is an organisation aimed at teenage volunteers. If you don’t have any unique skills, you can still benefit your local community. The Coram Beanstalk Charity can match you with a local school to help children with their reading. Independent Age can introduce you to older people struggling with isolation and loneliness to provide friendship services such as phone calls and visits. The Refugee Council also has a befriending programme.",News/Society,Loving and giving: try volunteer work,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/09/loving-and-giving-try-volunteer-work
1/9/2022,"Nobody is quite what they seem. And actors? Well, for actors that’s the job. Dame Helen Mirren, as well as being herself for 76 years, has by now notably been Lady Macbeth, a London gangster’s moll, a thief’s wife, an alcoholic cop, an action hero, Prospero and also a British monarch at least four times. Now she takes on Golda Meir, the late prime minister of Israel, in a new biopic, and the casting has caused controversy. The choice of a non-Jewish actor to star as a woman with such a prominent place in the history of Israel has prompted irritation on both sides of the argument. Another illustrious dame, Maureen Lipman, was first to raise the issue – or “blast” Mirren, according to some reports last week – and then Dame Esther Rantzen defended the director’s choice. It is the latest instance of a ‘Jewface’ row, a backlash to the assignment of a major Jewish role to someone not from that minority background.  But the list of things that Mirren ‘is not’ is long, and it does not necessarily start with ‘not Jewish’. For openers, she is not of English descent. She was born Illiana Lydia Petrovna Mironova into emigre Russian aristocracy in 1945 in Chiswick. This means that her Oscar-nominated role as Leo Tolstoy’s wife Sofya in the 2009 film The Last Station may be the closest to her own natural ‘type’. Certainly, she is not the bun-baking, clothes-shedding Yorkshire woman she played in the 2003 hit Calendar Girls. In fact, her great grandmother was a White Russian countess and her grandfather, Tsarist officer Pyotr Vassili Mironov, was caught in London, where he had been negotiating an arms deal, after the Bolshevik revolution and was permanently separated from his funds. Mirren’s father was a taxi driver and mother the 13th child of an East End butcher. As a result the actor sees her family as “Chekhovian” displaced gentry, rather than one of Tolstoy’s elite. “I grew up in a middle-class family who were living in a working-class economic situation,” she has explained. As a Catholic schoolgirl alongside her sister Kate in Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, the family Russianness became “an awkward thing you didn’t mention”, Mirren has recalled, although both daughters still have what they call “our soulful Russian moments”. To please her father, Mirren went to teaching college, but also won a place with the National Youth Theatre. Working at both, she quietly hoped the stage training would pay off first. It did. As a rising star at the Royal Shakespeare Company in the 60s, Mirren played Lady Macbeth in 1974 and was duly dubbed Sex Queen of Stratford. Her often provocative film career kicked off in 1969 with The Age of Consent, in which she was the young object of desire for James Mason. But the long path to stardom she has since followed was far from certain. “When I started acting I felt like I didn’t fit in to the Zeitgeist, if that’s the right word, of British theatrical culture,” she has said. “I wasn’t an ‘English Rosey’ sort of person.” Last week Mirren kept her own counsel on the Jewface dispute, but it is an issue that soon took some illuminating, even amusing turns. Speaking on BBC Radio 4 on Friday, David Baddiel and Lipman examined the case and largely concurred. “Actors should be allowed to act,” said Baddiel, “But if there is now outrage about casting against type, then why is there no outrage when it comes to Jews?” The writer and comedian went on to point out a string of recent examples of casting non-Jewish actors in substantial Jewish roles, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Joan Rivers. The widespread notion that, to cite the title of Baddiel’s latest book, ‘Jews don’t Count’ when it comes to fair representation, stems, he argues, from the fallacious and “ridiculous” belief there are so many Jews of influence in entertainment that it doesn’t matter. Praising Mirren and predicting a “fine” performance as Meir, Lipman added that she also is opposed to the kind of “narrow casting” that would see parts matched up closely to an actor’s background and so prevent Benedict Cumberbatch playing a cowboy. Dame Maureen argued, nevertheless, that a Jewish actor should have been considered first and that a Jewish audience will recognise the difference. “Hilda Schwarzkopf from Hendon will know,” she said. The putative Mrs Schwarzkopf has yet to comment. It will not be the first leading Jewish role Mirren has played. In Woman in Gold, she was Maria Altmann, niece of the muse of Viennese painter Gustav Klimt.. Altmann’s aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, had been the model for a famous 1907 portrait seized by a Nazi collector. In 2006, after a long legal case, the Klimt was returned to the family by the Austrian state and was sold for £73m. Altmann, who died ten years ago, donated money to arts institutions and Holocaust survivors’ groups. “It was justice,” Mirren said at the time. Not usually shy of expressing her views, Mirren has called for change in Hollywood, championing the career of black directors and publicly objecting to the surfeit of violence towards women on screen. In 2010 she ticked off an assembled group of Hollywood women, many of them powerful executives, for making films that chiefly served “the 18 to 25-year-old male and his penis”. Happily, things have improved a little for women in the industry since the TV appearance Mirren infamously made at the age of 30 on Parkinson. The chat show host harped on about her physical attributes in a way that she now considers “outrageous”. “I was terrified. I watched it and I actually thought, bloody hell! I did really well. I was so young and inexperienced. And he was such a fucking sexist old fart.” Professionally Mirren has herself been accused of being drawn to the edges of acceptability, or perhaps to sheer naughtiness. You might have seen her on screen in Lindsay Anderson’s O Lucky Man! Or in the louche 1980 film Caligula. Before Prime Suspect’s Jane Tennison marched on to small screens in 1992, Mirren was probably still best known as Bob Hoskins’ uninhibited paramour in The Long Good Friday, a part she played when she was 35. But at 44 she starred in Peter Greenaway’s The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover, involving intimate scenes in a ladies’ loo. Then at 61 she played her first Queen Elizabeth, the Tudor one, in an HBO miniseries that got her properly noticed in America. Her time as the current Queen, before it became normal for British actors to play Elizabeth II, came with the Stephen Frears film The Queen, which won her an Oscar in 2006. (For Americans, she noted, “You are, for the rest of your life, an Oscar winner. It’s like winning an honour here, it becomes part of your name.) The actor does not like to repeat herself and has recounted a violent initial reaction to screenwriter Peter Morgan’s invitation to return to the part of Elizabeth on stage in his play The Audience. “You bastard!” she recalled thinking, claiming Morgan had calculated she would not be able to resist. “How could I? And yet at the same time you don’t want to go backward; you really don’t want to be a one-trick pony. And when something has been as successful and as high profile as The Queen was, it’s a dangerous thing.” It was all right, though. She won an Olivier for her portrayal. Before Mirren met her husband, director Taylor Hackford, 35 years ago on the set of his 1985 film White Nights, her boyfriends were suitably glamorous. The Russian emigre Prince George Galitzine was on her arm in the 1970s and for a while in the 1980s she lived with “my darling Liam Neeson”. It was he who Mirren said listened when she felt early pangs about ageing: “I remember getting very drunk and just sobbing because he was eight years younger than me: ‘It’s all over. It’s all very well for you, my career is about to come to an end and nobody will ever employ me again and in a few years’ time I will be finished.’” Neeson, apparently, was “completely unsympathetic”, merely replying, “Ach, shut up.” Today it is evident just how right he was.",Arts/Culture,Helen Mirren: is the Israeli icon Golda Meir a role too far for the dame who does it all?,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/jan/09/helen-mirren-is-the-israeli-icon-golda-meir-a-role-too-far-for-the-dame-who-does-it-all

Sure, it’s in a handbag that doesn’t belong to her, but has been abandoned at a bus stop, so she decides the coins are fair game. The pair plan to pawn them and pay off some of Rahim’s debt, but ultimately decide to return the money to its owner. Yet in this wry moral drama from the Oscar-winning Iranian film-maker Asghar Farhadi (A Separation, The Salesman), no good deed goes unpunished. Rahim’s simple act becomes the talk of the town; much like a tweet gone viral, it’s quickly taken out of context. Gossip spreads through the city of Shiraz, warping his story into a feat of nobility and turning him into an inadvertent public figure. It’s an opportunity the desperate Rahim embraces all too readily, eager to improve his reputation. Jadidi is brilliant as a man whose hangdog expression miraculously melts away in front of the camera. The local TV news station laps it up.  “Where in the world are people celebrated for not doing wrong?” fumes Bahram (Mohsen Tanabandeh), Rahim’s antagonistic creditor. Meanwhile, a charity organises a community fundraiser to help the reformed convict. In his appeals to the public, Rahim enlists his son, who has a severe speech impediment, as a kind of sympathetic prop. Refreshingly, Farhadi is ambivalent towards his “hero”, and his control over the film’s tone is masterful; what begins as funny and almost farcical, soon shifts into something much sadder and more sobering.

1/9/2022,"Iexperience frequent, urgent cravings for very specific things and act on them immediately. As soon as I open my eyes I often know exactly what I want: to wear a particular little outfit, buy a sandwich of a certain heft and filling from this shop in this postcode, eat it (for instance) on a bench under a tree. It’s a shame that the place in me capable of conjuring these whims also regularly churns out other, much more boring urges, and occasionally dangerous ones too. My brain is a constant game of Hungry Hungry Hippos, my dopamine receptors snapping noisily at an alarming rate, urging me to do things that actually bring me very little pleasure at all. Why do I want things that don’t make me feel good? I’m at the mercy of my lizard brain and the mechanisms of society designed to exploit it. The concept of the three-tiered brain – a primitive reptilian brain nestled like a living fossil in the clay of our most recently evolved, superior brains, was proposed in the 1960s by the neuroscientist Paul MacLean. Its scientific credulity holds about as much significance to me as that of the astrology app that sends me notifications each morning – it just provides a structure for me to think about my habits and how to change them. In short, the reptilian brain is the most primitive part of the brain. I visualise it quite literally as the lizard-like baby from Eraserhead, mewling and requiring constant attention from the other parts of the brain, the parts that have evolved over 10m years to quieten its cries.  The less regulated this part of the brain is, the more regrettable the desires. We are generally more capable of regulating these desires as we grow out of childhood, although for some people – myself included – it is harder than others. Desires can run away with themselves, and become all-consuming, without us really noticing. The caterpillar that simply wants a lovely apple on Monday is the same caterpillar that wants two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, four strawberries on Thursday, five oranges on Friday and then, inevitably, a piece of chocolate cake, ice-cream, a pickle, Swiss cheese, salami, a lollipop, cherry pie, a sausage, a cupcake and a slice of watermelon on Saturday. Giving in to our reptilian desires has been encouraged, rebranded as a sort of self-care both by a society that wants us to consume and those of us who enjoy consuming with impunity. But often we are simply experiencing anxiety dressed up as hedonism. If you have experience of any kind of addiction, this is obvious. Saying yes to every desire that occurs to us seems quirky and fun if it involves dyeing your hair orange and eating too many Haribo, but a little less so if instead what you’re doing is climbing into a stranger’s car to buy cocaine. The truth is though, cravings and their related behaviours don’t have to involve life-destroying habits to rob us of joy. I may no longer lose days of my life to bingeing booze and drugs, but the same lack of impulse control insidiously robs me of my time. I, like the majority of people, pick up my phone over and over again and open apps that I’ve just closed, scrolling and refreshing without agency. How did my phone even get into my hand? I watch reality TV instead of the films that I’ve been meaning to watch for years because my lizard brain tells me that it will feel good: instead what it often feels like is closer to nothing. It urges me to do things that require little energy and, in return, provide little in the way of reward. Dopamine controls our desire for things, but it isn’t cognitive. It isn’t that it doesn’t know what’s good for us – it doesn’t even know what we actually enjoy. To submit to these desires and consider that submission as an act of self-care is extremely misguided. Our lizard brain doesn’t know what we like doing, and it doesn’t care. It has very little purpose and succeeds, ultimately, only to make a noise annoying enough to distract us from what we originally set out to do. So how can I want what actually brings me joy? How can I quiet the Eraserhead baby – which nobody is convinced is actually a baby at all but instead simply various unhappinesses, swaddled – and reach for the things that provide lasting joy and satisfaction? If only I knew. We are taught to want, but not too much. We are rewarded for consuming, but judged for taking more than our fair share. It is a strange thing to navigate a world that encourages and shames us for the same behaviours, and difficult not to assign moral value to our urges – to categorise each desire as either good or bad. Instead I focus on remembering times when I have felt calm and fulfilled – not the sweet little drip, drip, drip of dopamine throughout the day but the deep, quiet satisfaction at the end of a difficult task, or a long journey with something beautiful at the end of it. Of course, it’s not about one or the other. Thankfully for me. I will try to live life mindfully, to create long-term goals, etc – but ultimately I will always serve my lizard-brain king.

1/9/2022,"“Alvin Ailey is black and universal,” says the actor Cicely Tyson as she presents him with a lifetime achievement award in a clip from 1988 that opens this thoughtful documentary about the African American dancer and choreographer. Film-maker Jamila Wignot pays particular attention to the specificity of Ailey’s black influences: the church, blues music and his southern upbringing, all of which informed his best-known work, Revelations (1960). Though Ailey was widely acclaimed, interviews with his former dancers, including Judith Jamison and George Faison, reveal the extent of his personal alienation. Being “the only one” in the predominantly white field of modern dance was only one aspect of his plight. Wignot subtly teases out the fact that despite having relationships with men, Ailey was not integrated into the queer community. He died from Aids-related complications, aged 58, in 1989.  Ailey’s story is interspersed with rehearsal scenes of a new work celebrating the 50th anniversary of the company he founded. Yet behind-the-scenes images of the dancers preparing for Lazarus are never as interesting or as graceful as the archive footage of Ailey himself.
