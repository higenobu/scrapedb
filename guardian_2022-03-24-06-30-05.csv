3/24/2022,"Tributes flooded in on Wednesday to Madeleine Albright, the first woman to hold the position of US secretary of state, who has died at the age of 84. “The impact that she has had on this building is felt every single day in just about every single corner … she was a trailblazer,” said the state department spokesperson, Ned Price. Albright came to the US in the 1940s as a refugee. Born Marie Jana Korbelová, she became the US’s top diplomat in 1996 and served during the last four years of Bill Clinton’s administration. She was the highest-ranking woman in the history of US government at that time. In his tribute, the former president George W Bush said Albright had “lived out the American dream”. “Laura and I are heartbroken by the news of Madeleine Albright’s death. She lived out the American dream and helped others realize itHe added: “I respect her love of country and public service, and Laura and I are grateful to have called Madeline [sic] Albright our friend.” Albright was a young girl when her family fled Prague for London after the Nazis took Czechoslovakia in 1939. She was raised Catholic but years later discovered that her parents were Jewish and that several family members had been murdered in the Holocaust. Having returned to Prague after the war, Albright and her family fled to the US in 1948 after a Soviet-sponsored communist coup seized power. “Madeleine was one of the most remarkable people I ever had the privilege to work with,” the former British prime minister Tony Blair said in a statement. “She had the sharpest of brains, the most lively conscience and the deepest compassion for humanity … She was an icon and an inspiration. I will miss her greatly. The world will miss her.” As US secretary of state, Albright advocated for Nato expansion and pushed for the alliance to intervene in the Balkans to end ethnic cleansing and genocide in Kosovo. “As the first woman to serve as America’s top diplomat,” said President Barack Obama in 2012 when Albright was presented with the Medal of Freedom, “Madeleine’s courage and toughness helped bring peace to the Balkans and paved the way for progress in some of the most unstable corners of the world.” The Florida congresswoman and Democratic Women’s Caucus co-chair Lois Frankel tweeted on Wednesday: “I’m sorry to hear about the passing of Madeline [sic] Albright. Her historic term as Secretary of State made our nation and world a better place, and she set the stage for women to follow in her footsteps. She was an outstanding person, public servant, & patriot who will be deeply missed.” Albright opposed the US’s 2003 invasion of Iraq, though she later expressed support for US troops in the country. But critics of Albright called out her support for US intervention more broadly and previous comments she made about the consequences of US sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s. During a 1996 interview with Lesley Stahl on CBS’s 60 Minutes, Albright was asked about the cost of those sanctions and the impact they had on Iraqi children. “We have heard that a half million children have died. I mean, that’s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it?” asked Stahl. Albright replied: “I think this is a very hard choice, but the price – we think the price is worth it.” Before her death, Albright apologized for those comments, calling her remarks “totally stupid” in a New York Times interview published in 2020.",News/US news,‘A trailblazer’: political leaders pay tribute to Madeleine Albright,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/madeleine-albright-tributes-obama-bush-blair
3/24/2022,"Madeleine Albright, who has died of cancer aged 84, was the first woman to hold the office of secretary of state of the United States. It fell to her to cope with the painful dilemmas presented for the US by the breakup of Yugoslavia and the rise of Islamic opposition in the Middle East. While she fulfilled the role in the administration of President Bill Clinton, she could not take the place that office usually confers as third in succession to the president because she was not a “natural born citizen” of the US. Like Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, secretaries of state in the Nixon and Carter administrations, she had been a refugee from Europe. Like them also, Albright came to the job not via business or politics but through an academic background in the study of international relations. Like Brzezinski, her professor at Columbia University, she was the daughter of a diplomat. Her father, Josef Korbel, took refuge from the communist government of his native Czechoslovakia, becoming a professor at the University of Denver. She was brought up a Roman Catholic and became an Anglican after her marriage, but when Albright became secretary of state, she received letters telling her that her parents were Jewish, and a Washington Post journalist, Michael Dobbs, after painstaking research, convinced her that this might be true. This caused a good deal of comment, some of it critical of her having concealed her ancestry. The truth seems to be that she was genuinely ignorant of her Jewish heritage. She concluded that in the Czechoslovakia of the 1930s, where Jews were often seen by Czechs as part of the German minority, her parents, Josef and his wife, Anna (nee Spieglová), thought she would have a safer life if she were seen to be Czech. Three of her grandparents subsequently died in Nazi concentration camps. Eldest of three children, she was born Marie Jana Korbelová in Prague. Her family took refuge from the Nazis in Switzerland, where she was educated at the Préalpina Institut pour Jeunes Filles on Lake Geneva. Madeleine was a French version of her Czech name. During the second world war, her family moved to London, which became the headquarters of the Czech government in exile, and Madeleine was brought up first in Kensington Park Road, Notting Hill, then in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, and Walton-on-Thames, Surrey. Later, the Korbels returned to Prague, but in 1948, when the communists took over there, they moved to the US. In 1957 she went to Wellesley College, near Boston, one of the elite women’s colleges. There she became an American citizen. When working a summer vacation shift at the Denver Post, she met a scion of one of the most powerful American newspaper dynasties of the time, Joseph Albright, descendant of the founder of the Chicago Tribune. They married in 1959. If Madeleine had been born with a silver spoon, Joe Albright’s spoons were of the rarest platinum. His family was at the heart of American business, political and social life. At different times his relatives owned the Tribune, the Washington Times-Herald, the New York Daily News and Long Island’s Newsday, and they traded properties with William Randolph Hearst. Madeleine Albright took a master’s degree, then a doctorate in international relations at Columbia University, New York, where Brzezinski was one of her teachers. From 1976 to 1978 she worked as a legislative assistant to Senator Ed Muskie, a Democrat, of Maine. In 1978 she was recruited by Brzezinski to do congressional liaison on the national security staff at the Carter White House. After Jimmy Carter’s defeat by Ronald Reagan in 1980, she went to the Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, where she undertook a study of the new politics of eastern Europe. In 1981, when her husband left her, Albright threw herself into the academic, political, social and fundraising worlds in Washington. In 1982 she began to teach at Georgetown University, and she worked on the election campaign staffs of Geraldine Ferraro, Democratic candidate for vice-president in 1984, and of Michael Dukakis, presidential candidate in 1988. Albright, with her considerable expertise in both domestic and international politics, and her ability to speak several foreign languages, was a natural choice for Clinton, when he was elected president in 1992, to choose as US ambassador at the United Nations. There she soon demonstrated charm and competence, occasionally tarnished by a certain proneness to accident. She miscalculated badly when she advised that Slobodan Milošević, the Serbian nationalist leader, would cave in after brief bombing during the Kosovo crisis. More seriously for her reputation, when she was asked on NBC television by the journalist Lesley Stahl about the alleged death of half a million children as a result of sanctions imposed on Iraq, Albright responded that “we think the price is worth it”. The remark portrayed her as hardbitten, which was far from the case. The sanctions policy had been in place long before the Clinton administration, but the comment was not forgotten. By the time of the Clinton administration, a female secretary of state was, if not exactly an idea whose time had come, at least not unthinkable, if the woman were well known and well liked in the Washington Democratic establishment. It is said that Clinton asked Albright if she was happy as ambassador to the UN; she replied that she was, but that she would rather be secretary of state. Clinton appointed her in 1997, at the beginning of his second term. When George W Bush was elected president in 2000, Albright slipped back comfortably into her role as a popular member of the establishment, greatly in demand as a speaker at conferences. She founded the Albright Group, to give political advice to corporate giants such as Coca-Cola, Merck and the insurance behemoth Marsh and McLennan, as well as a private equity firm, Albright Capital Management. In 2003 she joined the board of the New York Stock Exchange, and twice in 2006 she was invited to the White House to advise Bush. In the 2008 election she was in the Democratic camp as an adviser to Hillary Clinton in her campaign for the presidency, and again in 2016 - she told the Guardian: “I think she would have been a remarkable president”. In 2012, when she published Prague Winter, partly an account of the politics of central Europe in the run-up to the second world war, partly an account of her discovery that she was Jewish, reviewers and readers seemed much more interested in how she could not have known that she was Jewish than in her political thought or career. She was awarded the presidential medal of freedom by Barack Obama later that year. She is survived by her three daughters, Anne, Alice and Katherine, and six grandchildren.

3/24/2022,"Chelsea have had the terms of the licence imposed by government following the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich eased further, after they were allowed to sell tickets to fans for away fixtures. The club will not see any of the money made from these sales, nor from tickets sold at Stamford Bridge to visitors, which Chelsea can also now do. Instead the revenues will go to Chelsea’s opponents and competition organisers, including the Premier League, the government said. Neither will Chelsea fans be able to buy home tickets to watch the men’s team, but the changes will ease some of the current uncertainty faced by supporters. An updated “general licence to stage football matches” was issued by the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) on Wednesday night, and the sports minister Nigel Huddleston said the changes were made with supporters in mind. “I would like to thank fans for their patience while we have engaged with the football authorities to make this possible,” he said. “Since Roman Abramovich was added to the UK’s sanctions list for his links to Vladimir Putin we have worked extensively to ensure the club can continue to play football while ensuring the sanctions regime continues to be enforced.” The General Licence contains eight clauses of “permissions” which include granting the club the right to pay staff, pay off debts and to generate “reasonable” costs in travelling, amongst other things. The terms of the travel clause have been altered by government already, allowing the club to spend more on transporting their players to matches than was originally determined. Clause 7 of the licence grants the club the right to sell tickets and clause 8 determines that another club or a “relevant body” may “receive and retain the proceeds of sale of those tickets”. However the precise terms are complicated and vary depending on competition. The revenue from all the matches will go to charity, with the Premier League stating: “Chelsea FC have requested and the Premier League agreed that this revenue will be donated to charity to benefit victims of the war in Ukraine. The beneficiary charities will be announced in due course after consultation with the club.” The licence changes come as the club continues to go through a sales process which has seen multibillion-pound bids made by parties from across the globe. The Raine Group, which is in charge of facilitating the sale for Abramovich, is anticipated to announce a shortlist of candidates for the takeover by the end of the week, with the government having the ultimate in approving the preferred bidder.",Sport/Football,Chelsea permitted to sell tickets to their fans for away fixtures,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/23/chelsea-permitted-to-sell-tickets-to-their-fans-for-away-fixtures
3/24/2022,"A Russian reporter has died after coming under Russian shelling while she filmed destruction at a shopping centre in Kyiv, becoming at least the fourth journalist to die since the conflict began almost a month ago. Oksana Baulina, who previously also worked for the Russian opposition leader Alexander Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation, was killed alongside another civilian on Wednesday while reporting for the independent Russian news website the Insider. Two other people in the group were wounded in the attack which took place in the Podolsky district of Kyiv, the outlet reported. “The Insider expresses its deepest condolences to Oksana’s family and friends,” it said. The publication added: “We will continue to cover the war in Ukraine, including such Russian war crimes as indiscriminate shelling of residential areas which result in the deaths of civilians and journalists.” Baulina began her career working for lifestyle magazines including Time Out Moscow and In Style, but after a decade she shifted to more political work, becoming a producer for Alexander Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation. She was briefly jailed when Russian police stormed the group’s headquarters where she was coordinating a live broadcast from a national rally. Baulina left Russia after authorities declared the Anti-Corruption Foundation an “extremist organization” in 2021 but she continued to report for the Insider and Coda Story. After Russia invaded Ukraine a month ago, Baulina filed several reports from Kyiv and Lviv in western Ukraine for the Insider. Sergiy Tomilenko, head of the Ukranian journalists’ union, confirmed the death in a statement on Facebook, saying that Baulina was reporting on the aftermath of a shelling when she was hit by fresh fire. Alexey Kovalev, the investigations editor at the Latvian-based Russian news website Meduza, paid tribute to Baulina’s “phenomenal sense of moral clarity”. “Oksana ditched a successful career in glossy magazines (I first met her at Time Out Moscow in 2006 where she edited the fashion section) to become an opposition activist, human rights campaigner and then full time reporter. Arrested several times, her org declared ‘extremist’,” he tweeted. Anastasia Karimova, a program director at Foundation for Democratic Development in Washington, tweeted: “The Russian army has killed one of Russia’s best people.” Vladimir Milov, who worked with her at Navalny’s group, vowed to avenge her. “I will never forget her and to all those who are responsible for her death I promise that they won’t get away with (only) a trial and a verdict,” Milov said on Twitter. “What an unbelievable horror,” wrote Lyubov Sobol, another prominent member of Navalny’s team. At least three other reporters have been killed during the conflict: Brent Renaud, an American film-maker, Irish cameraman Pierre Zakrzewski and Ukrainian producer Oleksandra Kuvshynova. Television news crews have described being shot at even when they have identified themselves as journalists, prompting speculation that they were targeted on purpose. A cameraman for a local television station in the besieged southern city of Mariupol was reported to have been killed earlier on Wednesday.",News/World news,Russian reporter killed in Kyiv shelling is fourth journalist to die in conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/russian-reporter-killed-in-kyiv-shelling-oksana-baulina

3/24/2022,"Rishi Sunak has been tackled by a single mother who cannot afford to heat her home and has had to take on two extra jobs, as the chancellor faced warnings that he has not done enough to address the biggest fall in living standards on record. He was challenged on LBC Radio by Hezel, a single mother, who said she had a good salary “on paper” but rising costs had put “an intense strain” on her ability to provide for her children. She told him that she had reduced her grocery bill to £15 a week, and sometimes goes without food so her children can eat. She said that she and her children had every light possible off, the boiler off, and could sometimes see their breath as they sat in their jumpers and coats. In addition to her main job, she has taken on extra cleaning and a job riding a bike delivering for Uber Eats. The caller said measures to help on energy bills so far “isn’t going to cut it” and asked him: “Please tell me what else I can be doing.” In reply, Sunak said he “cannot imagine how difficult” her job was, as he has a “wife and other help”, adding that he pays tribute to her for “working your socks off”. He pointed to the energy bill rebate and higher national insurance threshold that will give a tax cut in July, although it will only offset a tax rise due in April. He was also pressed by a caller named Timothy on the decision not to raise benefits despite high inflation. Sunak pointed him to the household support fund giving out supermarket vouchers but the caller said he had been told he was ineligible in his area as a single person. Another caller, Sarah, who said she was struggling to get a job, was told by Sunak to look at the Kickstart scheme – which closed for new applications from employers in December and ends entirely next week. Sunak was also pressed by the presenter, Iain Dale, about whether he can understand the struggles people are facing when his own family is very wealthy. “I’m sitting here in this job as the product of a lot of sacrifice and a lot of kindness from a lot of people in my life,” Sunak said, saying his parents had “worked their socks off” to give him a better life. “I work day and night to spread those opportunities to make sure as many people as possible have those same types of opportunities.” He added: “I’m making sure that I’m on people’s side and I’d say judge me by my actions.”",News/UK news,Rishi Sunak tackled on LBC Radio by mother who cannot afford to heat home ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/rishi-sunak-tackled-on-lbc-radio-by-mother-who-cannot-afford-to-heat-home
3/24/2022,"The US has formally accused Russian forces of committing war crimes in Ukraine and said it would pursue accountability “using every tool available”. The announcement came as Joe Biden left for a trip to Europe to bolster western unity in the face of an increasingly brutal invasion. The secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said that the US had come to its conclusion using both public and intelligence sources. “Today, I can announce that, based on information currently available, the US government assesses that members of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in Ukraine,” Blinken said. “As with any alleged crime, a court of law with jurisdiction over the crime is ultimately responsible for determining criminal guilt in specific cases,” he added, saying the US would continue its efforts to gather evidence and share it with international institutions. “We are committed to pursuing accountability using every tool available, including criminal prosecutions,” Blinken said. The announcement follows a week after Joe Biden’s off-the-cuff remark that he considered Vladimir Putin a war criminal, triggering an official protest from the Kremlin, which warned that the comment could cause a breach in bilateral relations. Asked if the state department designation applied specifically to Putin, Beth Van Schaack, the newly confirmed ambassador at large for global criminal justice, said it would be up to the courts to decide that. But she added: “There are doctrines under international law and domestic law that are able to reach all the way up the chain of command.” The state department did not give details of specific attacks and incidents it considered to amount to war crimes. In his statement, Blinken said: “We’ve seen numerous credible reports of indiscriminate attacks and attacks deliberately targeting civilians, as well as other atrocities. Russia’s forces have destroyed apartment buildings, schools, hospitals, critical infrastructure, civilian vehicles, shopping centers, and ambulances, leaving thousands of innocent civilians killed or wounded. “Many of the sites Russia’s forces have hit have been clearly identifiable as in-use by civilians,” he said, and pointed to the example of the shelling of Mariupol’s maternity hospital. Van Schaack said the Mariupol hospital shelling “appears to have been a direct attack upon a civilian object”. She said she would support making US evidence public, whenever possible. “I think it’s important to do that,” she said. “Obviously, we have to do a full assessment of the information that’s available to us and make sure that it doesn’t compromise any means and methods of collection. But I think keeping the world apprised of what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine is extremely important.” The Ukrainian government and some public figures, including the former UK prime minister Gordon Brown, have called for the creation of a special tribunal on Ukraine specifically to try the Kremlin leadership for launching a war of aggression. Van Schaack was noncommittal on the issue but said “there are some options for accountability even absent a dedicated tribunal”. “We’re considering all the various options,” she said, pointing to the possibility that cases could be heard by Ukrainian courts, courts in neighbouring countries and the international criminal court (ICC) in The Hague. The US is not a party to the ICC and has opposed its investigations into crimes committed in Afghanistan and in the Palestinian occupied territories, but it has said it would help the court collect evidence on Ukraine. The ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, has launched an investigation into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity, and there are a range of other initiatives aimed at gathering evidence by interviewing refugees after they cross the border and through the forensic examination of the huge volume of video footage uploaded on social media. War crimes experts have said that as the invasion has stalled, and the Russian military has resorted to increasingly desperate means and more unguided munitions, it has become more straightforward to provide evidence for war crimes cases. It is often hard to pursue accountability from the perpetrators on the ground up through the chain of command to political leadership, but in this case, experts say, the public statements by Putin and his senior officials and the Russian president’s tight control over the campaign would help future prosecutors. The UN’s international court of justice (ICJ) has already given a provisional ruling, ordering the invasion to halt, as it had seen no evidence to support Moscow’s claim, used to justify the attack, that Ukrainian government forces had been committing “genocide” against Russian speakers in the east of the country.",News/World news,US formally accuses Russia of war crimes in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/russia-war-crimes-ukraine-us-blinken
