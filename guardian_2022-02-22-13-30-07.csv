2/22/2022,"Japanese women have outperformed men in medical school entrance exams for the first time since universities admitted they had deliberately failed female applicants to inflate the number of male doctors. According to new government data, 13.6% of female candidates passed exams at 81 medical schools last spring, compared with 13.51% of men.  It is the first time that women have fared better than their male counterparts since the education ministry started keeping records in 2013. The latest results are a reversal of those over the previous eight years, when the pass rate among men exceeded that of women by up to 2.05 percentage points. Japan’s academic world was shaken in 2018 by revelations that several medical schools had deliberately marked down female candidates, triggering accusations of institutional sexism and demands for greater transparency. Ten of the country’s most prestigious schools admitted that they had systematically discriminated against women to ensure a sufficient number of men were admitted. The gender-based manipulation of results came to light after Tokyo Medical University was alleged to have offered a place to the son of a senior education ministry official in return for a favour. The schools said they had deliberately failed female candidates due to concerns that women were more likely to quit their medical careers to start families amid a nationwide shortage of doctors. Of the schools that were found to have discriminated against female candidates, six had higher acceptance rates for women than for men in 2021. A higher percentage of women than men had passed at a small number of schools the year after the scandal, but this is the first time the trend has extended nationwide. An education ministry official said the data proved that women were no longer at a disadvantage when they applied for places at Japan’s highly competitive medical schools. “It has become clear that the acceptance rate will not be low only for female applicants,” the official told Kyodo news agency. The proportion of female doctors in Japan is still significantly lower than in other developed economies, however. A 2018 survey by the health ministry found that just 21.9% of doctors were women, the lowest share among countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, in which the average was 46% in 2015.",News/World news,"Women outperform men in Japanese medical school entrance exams, years after testing scandal",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/women-outperform-men-in-japanese-medical-school-entrance-exams-years-after-testing-scandal
2/22/2022,"The New South Wales transport minister, David Elliott, has revealed he went to bed while his department was grappling with whether to shut down Sydney’s rail network on Sunday night. Elliott said on Tuesday that the government had withdrawn its application against the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) in the Fair Work Commission (FWC), and would negotiate with them instead.  He said reduced services would continue today and potentially tomorrow but he hoped dropping the fair work action would result in a compromise soon. During an extraordinary press conference on Tuesday the transport minister conceded he was not aware in advance of the decision to suspend train services in the early hours of Monday, nor did he inform the premier, Dominic Perrottet, of the looming shutdown, because he went to bed before a decision was made. Despite telling reporters that he had an “inkling” of what was to come, Elliott said he had not informed Perrottet “because I had no confirmation and I didn’t know exactly what action Transport for NSW would be taking”. While stating that he was “OK” that officials hadn’t called him at 12.43am when the call was made to shut down the system – “because I may not have answered the phone” – Elliott said he was “asking for information” about the decision. “We pay these people to do their job and I accept the fact that at 12.43am it was their judgment call; as executives they needed to use their discretion and close the system,” he said. “Did I like it? Absolutely not. Am I still asking for information and details to justify the decision? Absolutely.” Elliott also admitted during the press conference that he had yet to see a copy of a risk assessment reportedly carried out by transport before the department made the call to shut down the network, saying he had “requested” to see it. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After accusing the rail union on Monday of “terrorist-like activity” and “hijacking the city” over what he incorrectly labelled a “strike” action, Elliott revealed on Tuesday that the government had withdrawn its FWC application. In markedly more conciliatory language, he said that he had met with the union on Tuesday and thanked RTBU NSW secretary, Alex Claassens, after the meeting. He said his earlier comments on Monday had come “on a day of high emotion”. “The people of Sydney were certainly disenfranchised but it was industrial action, and the union and I had a chat about that,” he said. “Going forward it is on the advice of senior counsel that the government will withdraw the matter currently before the Fair Work Commission ... in the interests of transparency and goodwill.” Earlier on Tuesday, union officials said they had met with Elliott for “bloodletting” and negotiations. Claassens said the meeting with Elliott was “a little bit tense” at first, accusing him and Perrottet of being “out there verbalising” the union. “We had a little bit of a bloodletting but after that we got on with the business of doing what we should have been doing all along and that is having a productive conversation about the way forward and how we can fix some of the things that are broken,” Claassens said to 2GB after the meeting. The union’s industrial action will continue, with trains expected to continue at a similar frequency on Tuesday and Wednesday before he hoped the commission could “resolve” the matter. “We will do everything we can to try and restore normal services as quickly as possible,” Claassens said. “There’s a deadline on us anyway because [the government wants] to run the normal timetable from the 28th. “We’ve all got a goal that we’ve got to try and work to and we’ll try and do what we can, but we do need them to meet us halfway on some of these issues.” Opposition leader Chris Minns said it was “implausible” that the minister was not informed of the shutdown before the general public. “If it’s true, it’s a complete failure of the transport system,” he said. “The minister is responsible and if he wasn’t told about it, what’s he going to do about it?” Minns called for the risk assessment used by Transport for NSW to make the decision to be made public. Monday’s disruption caused commuter chaos across the city, with effects felt across the network including routes connecting Sydney to the Blue Mountains, the south coast and Newcastle. Buses were put on to replace some services but commuters were told to allow for extra travel time.
