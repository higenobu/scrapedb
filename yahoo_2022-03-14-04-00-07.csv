3/14/2022,"Russians are trying to sell McDonald's menu items online, following branch closures. Popular items like Big Macs and McDonald's breakfasts have been offered at inflated prices. One listing on a classified-ads website offered McDonald's packaging for up to $373. Russians are attempting to sell McDonald's menu items online at highly inflated prices, following the closure of more than 800 restaurants in the country. Insider viewed multiple listings on Avito, a Russian classified-ads website, which offered products including Big Macs and McMuffins. Avito is described on LinkedIn as the most popular classifieds site in Russia and the second-biggest in the world. One Moscow-based seller advertised a Big Mac for the equivalent of $36. In Russia, the burger would usually cost 135 roubles, or around $1, according to The Economist's Big Mac index. Another seller recently posted a ""McDonald's Breakfast,"" including McMuffins, potato pancakes, and sauces for around $18. In a listing translated into English, the seller said they were offering the items to ""those who want to enjoy the last taste of a bygone era."" Nothing appears to be off-limits, with some people even attempting to sell ""McDonald's packages."" At the time of writing, one Avisto listing showed a paper bag being advertised for the equivalent of $373. It is unknown if the bag contained any products. The website also contained several other advertisements offering packaging, including cups and french-fries holders. One seller advertised a ""McDonald's signature glass"" for about $74. The closure of McDonald's branches in Russia sparked a strong reaction from its citizens in recent days. Footage shared on social media showed Moscow residents rushing to stores to grab meals before the closures. According to the Indy100, one Russian completely filled his fridge with McDonald's burgers ahead of the closures, per a photo posted on Reddit. ""McDonald's is permanently closing in Russia here is my friend's stash,"" the caption alongside the photo read. McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said in a memo to employees on March 8 that it was ""impossible to predict"" when McDonald's would reopen its restaurants, but that the company ""closely monitor the situation.""

3/14/2022,"S Sen. Jim Risch (R-Idaho) dismissed concerns about the conflict in Ukraine escalating into a full-scale war between Russia and NATO during an appearance on Fox News Sunday. ""How do you stop [Russian President] Vladimir Putin without starting World War Three,"" host Bret Baier asked Risch, who is the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. ""There's no doubt that you always have to keep in mind that you don't want to escalate to direct confrontation with Russia, [but] I wouldn't call it 'World War Three,'"" Risch said. ""I think it'd end pretty quickly, because with the conventional forces that he's had there, we haven't seen this kind of ineptness in a long, long time,"" he continued. Despite large advantages in manpower and weaponry, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has not progressed as quickly or as smoothly as many experts predicted. Sébastien Roblin wrote at The Week that Russia's performance in the war so far has ""gravely degraded Russia's military position in Europe — and above all its ability to compel with threats of force that fall under the nuclear threshold."" Putin has not shied away from making such threats. In his speech announcing the invasion of Ukraine, Putin threatened any country that attempted to intervene with ""consequences … such as you have never seen in your entire history,"" which most observers interpreted as a reference to Russia's 6,000-warhead nuclear arsenal. But not everyone takes Putin's nuclear threats seriously. ""Putin knows that no one wins a nuclear exchange. If he ordered a strike on the United States, a general would shoot him in the head,"" Sen. Lindsay Graham said during an appearance on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures. Graham has previously called for a Russian assassin to kill Putin.
