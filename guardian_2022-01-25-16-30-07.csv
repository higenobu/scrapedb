1/25/2022,"Celebrity chef Andi Oliver’s east London restaurant business has admitted taking weeks to hand over at least £6,000 in tips after staff say they downed tools in a dispute over pay. Up to 20 staff at Wadadli Kitchen and Wadadli Roadside in Hackney, both of which are currently closed, said they had received only a portion of the payment owed after writing to Oliver’s business partner, Garfield Hackett, in November saying they were going on strike.  They said at the time: “We ask for nothing more in return than what we are rightfully owed.” They estimate they were owed up to £9,000. The restaurant, co-founded by Oliver, who is the host on the BBC’s Great British Menu, charged customers for service on top of their bill and customers were also able to add tips. At present, there is no legal requirement to distribute such non-cash tips or service charges unless a worker’s contract states they will be distributed as part of their remuneration. However, the government has pledged to ban restaurants from keeping the service charge after numerous cases of staff losing out. Wadadli Kitchen admitted it had been slow to pay the service charge. It said the restaurant had closed after the end of the season, and because of government measures after a planned winter barbecue in late November rather than because of any strike. It said that two members of staff continued to work for the business and two had been employed at some point in recent weeks. It said £6,000 was owed and half of this had been paid in October and the other half in January. It said staff had been contacted with an explanation in December. The December letter to workers said management would get a third of the service charge with 70% of the rest going to waiting staff and 30% to the kitchen team. But one worker said the team had expected the service charge to be evenly split between kitchen and front of house staff and “there are still part-time team members who haven’t seen a penny”. The worker said the team had expected the restaurant to be open for at least a year. Hackett said: “Much like all other hospitality businesses, we’ve had a really hard time in the pandemic and were hoping that Christmas would help us get back on a solid footing. “Sadly, with the surge of Omicron this was not to be. Within a matter of days, 85% of our Christmas bookings at our event space were cancelled, which in turn decimated our already stretched cash flow. “All our staff, with the exception of three who did not invoice on time for the pay schedule, have been paid in full and we have agreed payment plans with our suppliers, but each one is happy with the arrangement and will be paid in full. We are grateful to them for understanding.” He said payment had been delayed by waiting for government Covid support grants and the company had been forced to secure a short-term loan to ensure it could make the payments this month. “We are embarrassed that we were not able to pay the entirety of the service charge shares immediately at the end of the pop-up run, as we are aware our staff rely on these payments. “We know this has been a really tough time for everyone and we are deeply saddened by letting our staff down. We have poured our heart and soul into last year’s Wadadli Kitchen pop-up restaurant.”",News/Business,Andi Oliver restaurant admits delay in handing tips to staff,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/andi-oliver-restaurant-admits-delay-in-handing-tips-to-staff
1/25/2022,"Pressed to name the most influential novel of the past decade, you could do worse than Rachel Cusk’s Outline, which laid a blueprint for fashionably decluttered fiction about barely-there narrators wafting through random encounters in unspecified European cities.Jhumpa Lahiri (Whereabouts) and Katie Kitamura (Intimacies) have well-thumbed copies, at a guess, and it seems a safe bet that the Turkish-born Ayşegül Savaş, who writes in (American) English, also had one close at hand while composing this oddly enthralling tale about a postgrad student bearing witness to an artist’s marital breakdown.Its unnamed protagonist comes to an unnamed city to spend a year viewing gothic nude sculptures as research for a thesis on medieval views of nakedness. She’s renting a flat from Pascal, an academic who lives in a nearby town with his wife, Agnes, a middle-aged painter. A couple of months into the narrator’s tenancy, Agnes turns up to join her in the flat, in a supposedly brief return to the city to plan a new exhibition of work inspired (coincidentally) by local sculpture.  A peculiar bond ensues over kitchen-table coffee breaks as the narrator, craving approval from her magnetically elegant landlady, listens attentively to Agnes narrate at length her bitter experiences as a daughter, artist, wife and mother of two. By contrast, we learn next to nothing of the narrator, as Agnes’s tale unspools in piecemeal vignettes. When Agnes first brought Pascal home to her parents, he cut the visit short to write a paper for a symposium; when, after the birth of her first child, Agnes became friends with another new mother, Pascal hired an “extraordinarily beautiful” au pair to save her needing company.If the reader twigs more or less right away that Pascal is something of a wrong ’un, Savaş deftly draws a veil over the exact shape of his iniquity until a surprisingly tense climax that sees him deliver his side of the story. For a novel in which, for the most part, very little happens, Savaş maintains suspense impressively via, say, ominously blank descriptions of sunlight playing on the flat’s fixtures and fittings. Rare lapses come when she seems to fret that the action, or lack of it, can’t hold our attention. When Agnes says she’ll stay longer in the flat, the narrator’s reply closes the segment with unnecessary force: “I didn’t mind, I said. In fact, I was glad to hear it, even though I did wonder what it was that kept her away from her marriage.”It helps that Savaş is happy to acknowledge the in-built contrivance of the book’s delivery mechanism, or what the faceless protagonist calls “the monologue unravelling daily, without cease”. “I’m going on and on,” Agnes admits; the narrator, for her part, tells us she doesn’t know how to “get up and leave”. She’s essentially an old-style frame narrator lent a sliver of psychological intrigue by her situation’s creeping strangeness; eventually, the book plays out as a kind of year-abroad tale in which her education isn’t about her studies so much as Agnes’s painful dispatch from the battle lines of later life.At one point, Agnes explains that she set herself “the challenge of painting only in white”. By telling its story at a deliberately chilly remove, White on White rises to a similar task, even if its stylish austerity can’t fully shake the sense that it also represents a canny dodge of novel-writing’s more basic grunt work.

1/25/2022,"Until recently, Ron M would take illicit drugs in what space he could find: public restrooms, subway alleyways or just in the street. He often used alone; the possibility of a fatal overdose was high. That’s why the East Harlem overdose prevention center has been such a blessing to him.  “It’s saved many lives since it’s been here,” said Ron, 31. “It keeps us from having to get high in bad places.” Ron, whose last name has been withheld for privacy, has used heroin for years, but the New York opening of the nation’s first two sanctioned overdose prevention centers (OPCs) on 30 November has significantly increased his chances of survival. The center provides those who use substances with a safe and clean space to do so, and with help available in case of an overdose, which has already helped avert many deaths. “This place is a blessing – and if there were more, it would save so many lives,” Ron said. The stress, anxiety and isolation of the Covid-19 pandemic, combined with widespread contamination in the illicit drug market from the synthetic opioid fentanyl, has worsened America’s overdose epidemic. More than 100,000 Americans died of an accidental overdose in the year ending April 2021, a sharp increase compared with the previous year. The largest increase was among Black men. For many people struggling with problematic substance use, traditional methods of abstinence-based help – such as month-long rehab stays, or 12-step meetings such as Narcotics Anonymous – have failed to work. Such interventions can even increase the chances of a fatal overdose if a patient relapses. “In so many instances, it doesn’t meet people where they’re at,” said Melissa Moore, director of civil systems reform at Drug Policy Alliance. “It doesn’t match the reality of what that person’s going to be able to navigate.” Textbook tactics left over from the “war on drugs” have also failed, leaving thousands struggling with addiction entangled in the legal system and still unable to get help. In the wake of continual failures to address the surge of overdose deaths, experts across the country have backed the creation of OPCs that allow participants to use illicit drugs in safe environments under direct supervision. The centers challenge long-accepted beliefs that addiction can be solved only through abstinence, and connect clients with other services such as medical care and housing. “The people here, whatever they do in our organization, are helping save someone’s life,” said Sam Rivera, executive director of OnPoint NYC, the non-profit behind the city’s two new OPCs, one in East Harlem and the other in Washington Heights. OnPoint NYC was formed in a merger of the New York Harm Reduction Educators and Washington Heights Corner Project, groups that have been operating for decades. “We’ve been here,” said Rivera of their years of community engagement. “All we did to our program is improve it.” Since the centers opened, at least 85 overdoses have been reversed without medical attention; an ambulance was requested once, for a participant with additional medical complications. No one has died at either center, nor at any of the more than 120 OPCs operating in other countries. Rivera and his colleague Kailin See, both senior director of programs for OnPoint NYC who were instrumental in creating the OPCs, have a long history in harm reduction: Rivera started in HIV advocacy and syringe exchange, while See worked in North America’s first legal OPC, Insite, in Vancouver, Canada. The pair felt that although increasingly popular harm reduction interventions – such as giving substance users clean syringes and providing naloxone, the opioid reversal medication – are necessary, many people who struggle with substance use have remained vulnerable because they lack a place to safely use. Overdose interventionalists would often have to race to find someone who had overdosed, often on foot or by bicycle. Often they’d arrive too late. Now, OnPoint NYC organizers say the OPCs’ safe space for drug use has made reversing overdoses quicker, so much so that typically supplemental oxygen or small amounts of naloxone are the only interventions needed. It has also allowed staff to connect participants with other resources. “You don’t have to be alone in an alleyway, and you don’t have to be approached from a law enforcement point of view. It’s about keeping that person safe,” said Floyd Mitchell, the reduction assistance manager at the Alliance of Positive Change, Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center. Anyone can walk into the OPC, check in anonymously, and fill out a form to specify what drug they will be using, where they would use if the OPC was unavailable and other standard questions. The overdose prevention room (OPR) has a booth equipped with a sterile counter and a mirror, as well as sterile needles, cotton gauze and other tools. The rooms have timers so staff can assist if an overdose occurs. The OPCs also act as a hub for other necessary services: for example, the East Harlem location hosts a holistic center with lounge chairs, aromatherapy and other services. Doctors and nurses are on site to address any medical problems. There are group discussion sessions, laundry facilities and even showers. “[The goal is] to invite people in who are really marginalized, deal with the immediate crisis need of a lack of safety and the possibility of a fatal overdose, and stabilize and engage in care. And that’s happening,” said See. She added that the OPCs have encouraged addiction specialists, such as treatment and detox providers, to approach their work differently. She recalls the time a treatment director sat for two hours with a woman who was using in the OPR booths but was hesitant about a previously agreed-upon treatment; the director talked with her until she was ready to attend. “As [the director] left, he said, ‘You changed the way you’re working. We have to change the way we work, too,’” said See. Despite the successful implementation of OPCs in New York, other attempts to create similar solutions have been blocked nationwide. A supervised safe injection site in Philadelphia was cancelled by the Trump administration’s justice department in 2019; attempts in Chicago, San Francisco and other cities have stalled. The Biden administration has withheld explicit endorsement for OPCs. But, although New York’s OPCs have faced some pushback from politicians and community groups who worry they could increase drug use in already marginalized communities, Rivera and See argue the centers provide a direct response to persistent community complaints about discarded syringes, public intoxication and other drug-related concerns. “Any organization that’s courageous enough to open an OPC is saving the community by bringing people in,” said Rivera. “It’s supporting your request, cleaning your neighborhood, by bringing people indoors to a safe environment. “You might not know this was the solution you’re asking for. But this is part of the solution you’re asking for,” said See. Above all, they say, people have to see it for themselves. “When people get over the noise and the stuff in their own heads and just, in a sense, simplify it, they’re really able to see the impact,” said Rivera.",News/US news,Two pioneering overdose prevention centers in New York are saving lives ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/25/overdose-prevention-centers-new-york-saving-lives
1/25/2022,"In the pitch-black depths of a winter night, we pull off a deserted lane in the north-west of the Lake District and swerve into a deeply muddy farm field, wheels spinning in the gloop. Stepping out into the blackness I kick myself for not having my headtorch to hand – only occasionally does drizzly light from the crescent moon break through to illuminate the outline of the Lorton Valley hills above.  It is the first weekend of January, bitterly cold, and after many hours of driving cross country through snow, ice and hour-long traffic jams, my friend Charlie and I have followed a location code on the What3Words app to find an isolated shearing shed. Arriving here is just the start of the adventure. Our accommodation, the Hidden Hut, lies in a secret location somewhere up on the fell and we must find it with only an aerial photo marked with the route to guide us. Owners John and Hannah Graham usually lead guests, but it’s so late I’ve assured them we’re adventurous sorts, happy to find our way. Are we though? I’m soon re-evaluating when wet mud, heavy rucksacks and steep sections make tough work of the challenge. Pairs of red, robotic-looking sheep eyes reflect our torchlight, and as city folk unused to total darkness, our creeped-out minds fly immediately to Blair Witch. Yet with a few steers by text from John (there is phone signal) the cabin finally appears and inside it’s a different world – cosy, safe and stylish too. The Hidden Hut is the latest addition to Hinterlandes, the Grahams’ Lakes-based self-catering collection, launched in 2018, including a converted American school bus with hot tub and a family-sized black timber cabin. All are self-contained and transportable, moving from location to location every 28 days around local farmland that John leases from a friend who owns 200 acres. John also founded (and recently sold) the Lakes’ coolest cafe, Merienda, in Keswick, and has a 1958 Airstream, coastal yacht and more off-grid huts in the pipeline. In a land of a thousand cabins and glamping pods, it’s the element of adventure and challenge that makes the Hidden Hut something different. Sleeping in such an isolated hilltop position usually requires camping or roughing it in a bothy, but making the cabin small (7ft x 12ft) and movable gets around building regulations. “It’s probably one of the highest cabins in the UK, at about 1,000ft,” says John. “It’s not for everyone, but for someone who wants to get right into the depths of the countryside, it’s ideal.” It’s comfy too. The Scandi-ish interior is styled with a cutesy quilt, black wooden stools, industrial solar lighting and shelves of books and games. There’s a separate composting loo and marble shower and a wood-burning stove keeping it sauna-toasty. We warm a tagine we’ve brought on the hotplate and fall asleep top-to-tail in the double bed, nestling against a picture window. I wake with my face pressed against an incredible view, a restless expanse of hillocks and peaks rolling towards the coast. On a nearby hillock, two designer Hay chairs are arranged for admiring the raw splendour of the sheer-sided peaks around Loweswater and Buttermere to the south. Morning people would have risen before dawn to light the stove, but we are not them, so potter around the immediate private landscape waiting hours for the kettle to boil. It doesn’t. We wish we’d brought a camping gas stove for quick cuppas and resort to filling flasks at night for morning and infusing coffee bags in cold water. It’s our only complaint, though the “small hamper with wine and beer” containing two Tunnock’s wafers and one small can of sauvignon blanc is somewhat disappointing (the inclusion of oat milk saves it). But these are minor in the grand scheme of the surroundings. A short drive south past Loweswater and Crummock Water finds us in Buttermere, where imposing mist-wreathed giants – Kirk Fell, High Stile, Great Gable, Hay Stacks – that are immensely satisfying to scale are topped with snow. Given the scant daylight hours, we opt for a shorter run up Whiteless Pike, where strong winds nearly flatten us, finishing with an ecstatic sprint along the grassy lakeside ridge of Low Bank as the sun sets, gabbling idiotically about how we must become serious fell runners and should plan a hardcore expedition, perhaps to the Arctic. The overambition of this idea is pulled into focus when we’re hiking back up the vertical mud bath to the hut later that ink-dark night. The hut has an outdoor pizza oven, and provides dough ingredients and passata, so while climbing we plot the most efficient timing for the tasks ahead: firing the stove, making dough, breaking firewood into tiny pieces, lighting the oven, brewing coffee for tomorrow. The route is wetter and muddier, the wind insane, but finally, sweatily, we reach the hut. It starts to rain. And then it dawns on me. The key. We’ve left the goddamn key in the car. Such absentmindedness would be no big deal elsewhere; here it means an hour and a half’s hike back down and up again. Somehow, we don’t mind. We take beer and embrace the thrill of being outside on a wild winter night, and our own form of shambolic adventuring. At 1am, after burning through an entire box of matches, succeeding in lighting the oven only by using an emergency foil blanket as a windshield, we sit on the low tree trunk that wraps around the outdoor table like a bench, eating our delicious pizza (minus spinach, which blew away). Maybe we can hack the Arctic after all. The next day we seem to only have time for a brief, invigorating swim in freezing Crummock Water (something I agree to reluctantly, letting the Guardian side down by wearing a thick wetsuit), and a long warm-up in Buttermere’s Croft House Farm Cafe, before night falls again. But the winter darkness feels joyful now. We hike an hour down the road with head torches to Loweswater’s Kirkstile Inn, the best of Lake District pubs (an alternative route goes over the fell), for a superb dinner of Loweswater Gold tempura monkfish and nightcaps of salted caramel vodka from the brilliant Lakes Distillery. No cars pass by and the sky is extraordinarily clear, the stars brighter and more abundant than I’ve seen them in years. Blair Witch doesn’t cross my mind and the robo-sheep even look friendly. Our intention to go fell-running at dawn before leaving is reneged upon, but we are armed with cold coffee and feel shaken awake by this break, uplifted and fortified, with new goals and positivity. The cabin has been perfect for half-baked adventurers like us, the right mix of challenge and comfort. Making such a trip at the very start of January is a revelation. Christmas and New Year are left for dust and when I get home, it already feels like spring.Gemma Bowes was a guest of Canopy and Stars.

1/25/2022,"There’s a book by Nassim Nicholas Taleb called Skin in the Game. It’s wrong about many things, featuring an account of Prince Andrew’s place in UK culture that was hilariously misjudged even before we realised what his place truly was, but has a theory about families and their eating habits that used to sound right. When one person restricts their diet – goes vegan or keto or whatever – the whole unit defaults to that restriction. It’s just easier, when three people will eat anything, to build your menu around the one person who will only eat some things. The parable was supposed to illustrate a broader point, that the intolerant minority will always come to triumph over the more tolerant majority. Let’s not dwell on his mental leap, because one of my kids just went vegetarian and I now know that even the starting block is untrue. For about a fortnight, we all went veggie and nobody noticed. It’s not as if we were living a traditional, Harvester-buffet, meat-centrepiece, side-salad life before all this. I passed off black beans as a luxury food item, squash lasagne as classic Italian cuisine. Besides, meat substitutes have moved on a lot, and now they can make pretty much anything taste like pork so long as it has first been rolled into a ball.  Then came a fateful observation from one of the carnivores: “We haven’t had meat for a while.” After that, it became a relentless clash of pre-eminence, in the classic sibling mould. Every domestic argument from the day child two is born until the day child one leaves home amounts to this: in whose interests has this decision been made? If in theirs, then by definition, not in mine. We forged on for a couple of weeks, making vegetarian food with frankfurters on the side, but soon the incredibly not-silent majority had had enough of sausages. It’s got to the point where they want to know why the potatoes aren’t cooked in duck fat, and who left the ham out of their smoothie. I didn’t think I could ever be reconciled to a meatless future, where all flesh was synthetic, and actual animals only existed for petting and touristic purposes.

1/25/2022,"Apple’s AirPods need no introduction due to their ubiquity on the street, but is the third generation of the most popular wireless earbud actually an improvement? The new earbuds have been redesigned to resemble the Pro models with shorter stalks and a better fit. They don’t block your ear canal, like the Pros though, just rest in place with all the benefits and disadvantages of an open fit, including an airy feel and complete lack of isolation from the outside world.  Costing £169 ($179/A$279), they are being sold alongside the older 2nd-gen versions, now reduced to £119, and the £239 AirPods Pro. They stay in place even when jumping around or violently shaking my head, and are fairly comfortable for upwards of 90 minutes at a time. But as anyone who has tried the previous versions only to have them immediately fall out will tell you, your mileage may vary as each ear is unique. The shorter stalks have the same pressure-sensitive strip on them as the AirPods Pro. Squeeze it once, twice or trice to pause the music or skip track, or hold to access Siri on an iPhone. Take one out and the music pauses and resumes when you put it back in your ear. Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, SBC, AAC, H1 chip Battery life: six hours playback (30 hours with case) Water resistance: IPX4 (splash resistant) Earbud dimensions: 30.8 x 18.3 x 19.2mm Earbud weight: 4.28g each Charging case dimensions: 46.4 x 54.4 x 21.4mm Charging case weight: 37.9g Case charging: Lightning, Qi wireless (MagSafe) The charging case is slightly larger than that of the previous generation, but smaller than the AirPods Pro and is one of the smallest and most-pocketable of all true wireless earbuds. The battery lasted over seven hours in testing for music. And four for calls. A fully charged case can recharge the earbuds up to four times. A five-minute quick charge of the earbuds gives up to one hour of playback. The new AirPods have the same H1 chip and advanced features as other Apple headphones. They instantly pair with an iPhone or iPad, share the audio of one device to two sets of AirPods and automatically switch connection between Apple devices. The latter feature is magic when it works, but can easily get confused requiring manual switching. They are standard Bluetooth 5.0 earbuds, though, so can be used with most non-Apple devices such as Android phones and Windows PCs, but without the long squeeze, pause-on-remove and advanced features. The AirPods sound surprisingly good for non-isolating earbuds – a step up over their predecessors – and are able to produce more bass for a more rounded sound despite their open fit. They have an easy-listening sound with slightly accentuated treble. They handle complex tracks well but lack some of the detail and nuance really good earphones can produce. They can’t manage deep, thumping bass, making some tracks sound a bit thin, too. Their biggest issue is background noise. They can’t block anything so you can forget trying to listen to tracks on the London Tube or block out your co-workers in an office. That does mean you’re more aware of your surroundings, however. New for the AirPods is the support for virtual surround sound with Apple devices called “spatial audio”, which works for movies and music with Dolby sound tracks. It tracks the movement of your head and adjusts the sound so that it is always centred on the screen in front of you. Turn your head to the left and it will still sound as if the voices are coming from the screen, now predominantly into your right ear. It’s all very clever. Apple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries. Those in similar devices typically last at least 500 full charge cycles while maintaining at least 80% of their original capacity. A battery service costs from £45. The earbuds are not repairable, scoring a zero out of 10 on iFixit’s repairability scale, but Apple offers replacements costing £65 per earbud. The AirPods and case are made from recycled rare earth elements, tin and aluminium, but Apple does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products. The third-generation AirPods cost £169 ($179/A$279). For comparison, the AirPods Pro cost £239, the Beats Studio Buds cost £130, the Google Pixel Buds A-Series cost £100, the Microsoft Surface Earbuds cost £199 and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 cost £99. The AirPods 3 are a solid revamp of one of the most popular sets of true wireless earbuds, adopting a better design, improved sound, longer battery life and more advanced features such as spatial audio. Their open-air fit is unrivalled in the industry and certainly has some advantages. But the complete lack of noise isolation makes them hard to use in loud environments and stops them sounding as good as rivals with silicone earbud tips. They work really well with an iPhone and other Apple gear, but are more limited with Android and Windows devices, so I would only recommend them if you use at least one compatible Apple gadget. For the money you can certainly buy better-sounding earbuds, but none that have the open fit of the AirPods 3. If you don’t like silicone tips in your ear, these are for you. They are essentially unrepairable, however, making battery replacement improbable and ultimately making them disposable, losing a star. Pros: open fit, solid sound, decent battery, great case, good squeeze playback controls, great connectivity, special features with Apple devices including spatial audio, decent call quality. Cons: no sound isolation at all, no noise cancelling, lack features when connected to Android or Windows, no on-board volume control, cannot be repaired, expensive.

1/25/2022,"Adam Boulton has said Sky News faces “existential” questions about its future as it grapples with changing audience habits and the long-term funding necessary to keep an intensive 24-hour operation on the air. “I know there are executives at Sky that take the view there will only be one news channel in the UK in 10 years’ time and it probably won’t be Sky,” the former Sky News’ editor-at-large told the Guardian. “Any corporation is going to ask, ‘What’s the point of Sky News? Is everything it’s offering being done by others anyway so we might as well not bother?’ Colleagues at Sky News think about it all the time. It’s existential.”  When Rupert Murdoch sold the wider Sky business to the US media conglomerate Comcast in 2018, the new owners promised to fund the prestigious but lossmaking news service for a decade. Boulton, who left the channel last month after serving as editor-at-large, said Comcast had honoured the deal but the channel’s long-term future was unclear: “People are wondering what’s going to happen when the guaranteed funding under the takeover deal expires … the problem with the takeover arrangement was it put Sky News in aspic with the same funding and the same management.” Boulton, 62, is one of a number of big-name television news presenters who left their jobs at the end of last year, along with the likes of Andrew Marr and Jon Snow. He said there was less appetite for an authoritative “grey haired man that told you the news” and that it was time for baby boomers to hand over to a younger and more diverse set of presenters. However, having spent more than a quarter of a century as Sky News’ political editor, he defended the idea of authoritative “gatekeepers” in the media who can explain and contextualise events in real time. He said: “This is where my disagreement with [Sky News boss] John Ryley is sharpest. I think there is a general questioning of the whole notion of authority … There’s a feeling, which I think is John’s position, which is ‘put stuff out digitally and leave the public to decide what they want’. “John’s answer to that would be if you put the information out there with lots of digital analysis you’re still doing the job. My argument is that you’re not doing it in real time. I think it’s beneficial for society that’s there’s analysis and invigilation – not just post-fact but while things are happening.” An estimated 8 million Britons a month watch Sky News but most only watch briefly, meaning typical viewing figures during the daytime are nearer 100,000 people. It has also built up a substantial audience online. Asked about concerns from some Sky News employees that the channel’s coverage of the climate crisis is tipping over into campaigning, he said it was “basically benevolent” but did raise issues. “We had our chief executive appearing on a platform at Cop26, which we were sponsoring at a corporate level with Boris Johnson and [Joe] Biden and [Narendra] Modi. That made me think, really, how free are we to comment and analyse what they’re saying?” Boulton said he remained a believer in TV news but that the format needed to change, with audiences for traditional news bulletins continuing to fall. He said: “Sky is a fantastic company and should have a very good future. I wouldn’t say anything negative about it but all of us just have to look at changing markets. “This is not a static industry and nothing is for ever. You’ve got to recognise that these are the inevitable changes thrown up by technology.”",News/Media,Adam Boulton: Sky News faces ‘existential’ crisis as TV habits change,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/25/adam-boulton-sky-news-faces-existential-crisis-as-tv-habits-change
