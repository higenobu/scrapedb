2/24/2022,"Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim wants to rename the term “slut strands.” The two-time gold medalist, 21, spoke to InStyle this week about the hairstyle worn by women snowboarders, which features two pieces of hair sticking out from underneath their helmet. The goal is to show that it is a woman hitting the slopes under all that gear. While “slut strands” have been celebrated all over social media as women snowboarders dominated the Olympics this year, Kim wishes that there was a different moniker for the hairdo. ""We need to change the name to beauty strands,"" Kim told the outlet. ""I hate the term. Beauty strands make me feel beautiful, and it's such a cute thing."" While Kim may feel uncomfortable with the term, not everyone wants to change it. In fact, a Denver-based activewear company even named itself Slut Strand Society after the popular snowboarding term. On its website, founder Elsa Watkins defines the term while acknowledging it may have problematic connotations to some. “Two strands of hair commonly used by the ladies of skiing & snowboarding to express femininity under all dat gear,” the Slut Strands Society site reads. “No, they do not make someone a slut. And no, we do not support slut shaming. They are of comparable importance to your bindings themselves, a true staple to the lifestyle. We’re here to embrace em.” Watkins told Yahoo Life of the unknown origins of the term, in use since the early 2000s, she believes, “Our culture back then was a bit lawless and capitalized on being provocative and pushing the rules. So, did we necessarily like the hairstyle being called slut strands? Nope. But, the term wasn't ever going away, so we got to squash slut-shaming and reclaim our strands."" While Kim may be rocking “beauty strands” on the slopes, she told InStyle that the most important thing to her is representation. ""It's such an honor, and to be able to do something I love and bring more attention to my community is very important to me,"" she shared. ""It makes me so happy knowing there's an Asian American girl out there, looking up to me, wanting to try their best and work hard to make those dreams come true. It makes me happy knowing that I can be that person for her."" Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox? Sign up here for Yahoo Life’s newsletter.

Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Russia will target ""sensitive"" US assets as retaliation. The ministry said in a statement that the US sanctions against it are part of America's ""ongoing attempts to change Russia's course,"" CNN reported. ""Russia has proved that, despite all the sanctions costs, it is able to minimize the damage,"" the ministry said in the statement. ""And even more so, sanctions pressure is not able to affect our determination to firmly defend our interests.""

The ministry claimed that it was open to diplomacy with the US, but that the sanctions will be met with a fierce response. It added, ""There should be no doubt that sanctions will receive a strong response, not necessarily symmetrical, but finely tuned and painful to the American side."" The ministry's statement detailed no specifics, but explained that Russia will take ""measured"" steps out to retaliation by targeting ""sensitive"" US interests, The Moscow Times reported. US President Joe Biden on Tuesday announced the ""first tranche"" of sanctions against Russia as a result of what Biden called ""the beginning of a Russian invasion of Ukraine."" The US sanctions against Russia target the country's sovereign debt, two large Russian financial institutions, and Russian elites. ""We'll continue to escalate sanctions if Russia escalates,"" Biden warned. Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin recognized the independence of two Moscow-backed separatist regions in eastern Ukraine and ordered troops there.

2/24/2022,"JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Gangs inside a Mississippi jail often determine whether other inmates receive meals, a court-appointed monitor testified in a federal court hearing. Elizabeth Simpson testified Tuesday that staffing shortages are so severe at Hinds County's Raymond Detention Center that gangs and “inmate committees” control certain aspects of life, including whether some inmates get to eat, WLBT-TV reported. A former administrator of the jail, Maj. Kathryn Bryan, learned staff would put food on carts to take to the jail's housing units and would let the inmates distribute it, Simpson said. In two cases this January, detainees in a mental health unit were suffering severe weight loss as a result, Simpson said. U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves issued a civil contempt order Feb. 4, saying officials in Mississippi's largest county have failed to fix problems at the jail. He started holding hearings last week to determine whether to order a receivership in which the federal government would take over operation of the jail, with Hinds County paying the tab. Simpson testified Tuesday that inmate committees determined whether certain detainees could remain in housing units known as pods. “The detainees who control the unit decide who can be there and who can’t. If they don’t want (a detainee) there, they will set up assaults until they leave,” she said. The U.S. Justice Department sued Hinds County in 2016 after finding unconstitutional conditions at the jail, including “dangerously low staffing levels,” violence among detainees and violence by staff against detainees. It also found problems with treatment of juveniles and suicidal detainees. And, it said, the jail had cell doors that would not lock. Hinds County supervisors agreed to a federal consent decree in 2016, saying the county would correct the problems. Supervisors promised again in 2020 to fix the problems as the county faced the threat of being held in contempt of court. Reeves’s Feb. 4 order noted that the courts can set financial penalties for civil contempt orders. The legal action over the Hinds County jail is separate from an investigation the Justice Department began in February 2020 after an outbreak of violence in the Mississippi prison system. Many inmates being housed at jail are being held longer than required by their sentence due to poor record-keeping. One detainee remained too long because a jail worker used the wrong screen on a computer program to calculate his release date. “They don’t have a tracking system for people to be released,” Simpson said. During recent site visits, Simpson found six people had been “over-detained,” with one in custody 16 days too long and another in custody two months longer than his sentence mandated.",U.S./Associated Press,"Gangs control who eats at Mississippi jail, monitor says",https://news.yahoo.com/gangs-control-eats-mississippi-jail-163653023.html
