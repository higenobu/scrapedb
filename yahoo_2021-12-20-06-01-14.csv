12/20/2021,"(Bloomberg) -- Cruise LLC Chief Executive Officer Dan Ammann had a slate of meetings on Dec. 16 when he got an early afternoon call from General Motors Co. CEO Mary Barra. She told Ammann he was being dismissed from the robotaxi startup that GM controls through a majority stake, say people familiar with the events.

WFH Is Here to Stay What seemed abrupt to outsiders and people working at Cruise had been building for months. The two executives didn’t agree on how to focus the breakthrough self-driving technology that the Silicon Valley unit is preparing to launch with a taxi service. Barra and GM’s board were pushing a grand vision that included transferring that knowledge to create luxury Cadillacs, self-driving cars sold at retail or delivery vehicles for GM’s new electric-van business. The opportunities, and their potential value, were immense. Ammann -- a star in his own right who once competed with Barra to run GM -- was open to all of those things eventually, but he disagreed on some key points. First, he thought Cruise needed to focus on starting its taxi business before spreading its resources. Second, he wanted Barra and GM’s board to take Cruise public sooner rather than later, giving it stock to lure the rare talent that can program cars to drive themselves, said two people familiar with his thinking. Ultimately, the dispute was about control: In the vision shared by Barra and the board, keeping Cruise in-house gave GM both a high-margin robotaxi business and more direct access to the company’s resources to make other autonomous vehicles and services. Cruise could also enhance GM’s own assisted-driving features. People didn’t think the collaboration was smooth enough. If Ammann prevailed, there would be the further complication of public stakeholders in a new company to consider, not just the strategic interest and shareholder value of GM. Ammann, 49, discovered the hard way that Barra and her board call the shots, even though Cruise is legally a separate entity with other private shareholders besides GM. When he didn’t fall in line with that vision, it was over. How it all went down is instructive to how Cruise will be an integral part of GM and how it will probably be managed when Barra finds a new CEO. Rivals for CEO The split is an end to a long relationship between Barra and Ammann, who were the finalists for the top job at GM when Dan Akerson was looking for his replacement before retiring in 2014. Before GM’s board decided on Barra, the two candidates approached the directors and said that whoever didn’t get the top job would stay and work with the new CEO, said several people familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. Afterward, they worked in lockstep when cutting weak businesses and acquiring Cruise. In recent months, the pair of executives started to see more and more aspects of Cruise differently, the people said. If Ammann wanted, for example, to expand robotaxi services to other cities after San Francisco, did he need GM approval to start laying that groundwork? More and more, the answer was “yes” and GM was exerting its influence over the startup. Ammann reported to a Cruise board that is chaired by Barra and included Cruise founder and now-interim CEO Kyle Vogt. Other GM brass on Cruise’s board included President Mark Reuss, product development chief Doug Parks, general counsel Craig Glidden and GM director Devin Wenig. Former Alphabet Inc. executive Regina Dugan, the CEO of non-profit Wellcome Leap, also has a seat. Softbank Vision Fund and Honda Motor Co. have non-voting observer status on the board. They were consulted about the management change and didn’t object, two of the people said. Tensions Arise It was a quick fall for Ammann, who didn’t return a phone call or email seeking comment. Ammann had a starring role in October at GM’s investor day, when Barra made a case that GM could double revenue to $280 billion by 2030. He laid out how the company would start its self-driving taxi business soon and grow revenue to $50 billion in the next seven years. Margins could be 40%. Tension had been building for some time but the drama started amping up after a Cruise board meeting on Nov. 2. That’s when Barra made it clear that Cruise’s mission, in addition to its taxi business, was to develop technology for GM and create value for its shareholders. An IPO was not in the offing. Even though Ammann wasn’t completely aligned with that vision, Barra left the meeting feeling that the matter was settled, two of the people said. Cruise’s technology would serve as a platform for GM autonomous vehicles and services the same way the Ultium battery serves as a platform for many electric cars and the Ultifi software system will provide different connected services for GM vehicle owners. GM has been pressured by investors to spin out Ultium as a separate business, which Barra doesn’t want. After the November meeting, Ammann continued to try to make his case for an IPO and to have a bigger handing in deciding where the company would focus its resources. He was certainly willing to work on other projects with GM, but stressed the importance of letting his robotaxi plans remain the priority, which would push out the timing of other self-driving applications, two of the people said. Conversations were tense and leaders at GM felt collaboration was too challenging with Ammann in charge, they said. Ammann was still in the job after GM’s board meeting on Dec. 7. It was after that when Barra made the decision, consulting with both boards before make the move, two of the people said. Amman’s Dismissal In a sign of the inner turmoil, GM initially put out a press release at 4 p.m. Dec. 16 before quickly pulling it off the internet while Barra addressed Cruise’s staff. Vogt, Cruise’s founder, chief technical officer and now acting CEO, put Barra on speaker phone. He thanked Ammann for his service and Barra told Cruise managers that GM remained committed to the mission of developing self-driving cars. She said the company would find a first-rate CEO and that the company was special and deserved a special leader, two of the people said. One idea that had been floated was to make Vogt the CEO. He refused. Then there was a discussion about making Cruise’s Chief Operating Officer Gil West either CEO or co-CEO with Vogt. West, who had joined the company in January after leaving Delta Air Lines, also declined, two of the people said. He said it would be best if Vogt led the company that he founded. When the full press release was eventually circulated, it was devoid of any praise for Ammann: “General Motors Co. announced today that Dan Ammann, Chief Executive Officer of Cruise, is leaving the company. Kyle Vogt, Cruise President and Chief Technical Officer, will serve as interim CEO.” By contrast, when former Chief Financial Officer Dhivya Suryadevara left GM for financial-technology startup Stripe, Barra lavished her with praise. Decade at GM It’s an ignominious end for Ammann’s decade of work at GM. He was part of Morgan Stanley’s restructuring and IPO team and later joined the automaker as treasurer. He climbed to chief financial officer before being named president on the same day Barra was promoted to CEO. He played a big role in downsizing GM’s money-losing overseas operations, including Opel in Europe. That global restructuring has been a hallmark of Barra’s tenure and a big reason the company has grown profits. Ammann was central in buying Cruise, and Barra sent him to run it two years ago. The self-driving taxi startup has applied for permission from the California Public Utilities Commission to start charging for rides in autonomous vehicles that have no safety driver. Cruise also plans to launch a service in Dubai in 2023. Under Ammann, Cruise raised more than $6 billion from partners Microsoft Corp., T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., Honda and SoftBank Vision Fund. Those cash-raising rounds brought Cruise a valuation of more than $30 billion. When Barra sent Ammann to Cruise, the company gave him a compensation package that provided incentive to sell the company or execute an IPO. Ammann stood to get an estimated $25.6 million in restricted stock if Cruise was sold or went public, and he’d get 101,000 warrants in the self-driving startup. That showed that GM’s board wanted an IPO at some point, but nothing very soon. When asked about taking Cruise public on the company’s third-quarter earnings call, Barra was non-committal and said the close relationship was an advantage. With Cruise, “the vertical integration with GM is a key differentiator,” Barra said. “The message on Cruise is we’re well-funded and we have rapid commercialization plans in front of us, and that’s the play we’re executing. And over the longer term, the board will look at what best enhances the overall value creation and shareholder value for the GM shareholder.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek How McDonald’s Made Enemies of Black Franchisees A Fight to Die How to Have a Perfect Work-From-Home Friday A Wild, Emotional Year Has Changed Investing—Maybe Forever Tesla Takes Customers to Court to Silence Its Critics in China ©2021 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•5 hours ago,"GM’s Barra Dismissed Cruise CEO Ammann Over Mission, IPO Timing",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-barra-dismissed-cruise-ceo-160009402.html
12/20/2021,"China's securities regulator and American authorities have initiated talks on the audit inspection of US-listed Chinese companies, which could stave off the potential delisting of these firms after years of non-compliance. ""The relevant regulators of China and the US have started the negotiations over the regulatory cooperation issues [and] have made some progress,"" according to a statement from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) on Friday. The CSRC released the statement soon after US regulator the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) published early on Friday a report, which determined that it was ""unable to inspect or investigate completely"" registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland China and Hong Kong because of the position taken by authorities in those markets.

Seven mainland Chinese and eight Hong Kong accounting firms are currently overdue for inspection, according to the PCAOB. The report indicated that the PCAOB has never completed an inspection of a mainland Chinese firm and has not finished an inspection of a Hong Kong firm since 2010.

Photo: Simon Song> The 15 accounting firms mentioned in the US regulator's report are responsible for auditing 191 US-listed Chinese firms with a combined market capitalisation at US$1.9 trillion. The CSRC, however, said on Friday that the US report did not fully reflect China's efforts to reach a solution. It indicated that both the US Securities and Exchange Commission and PCAOB have been working with Chinese authorities to draw up a solution ""We are ready to have further discussions with US authorities any time,"" the CSRC said. ""As long as both sides adopt an approach of mutual respect and trust that follows international practice, the two sides can find a path that could meet the regulatory requirements of both parties to protect the interests of the global investors and the development of the capital markets of the two countries."" Last year, the CSRC presented proposals to collaborate with the PCAOB since 2019. These were geared towards reconciling local auditing rules with global bookkeeping standards, rebutting criticisms that Beijing was allowing Chinese companies to ""cheat"" on US capital markets. The CSRC's latest statement comes months after it pledged to cooperate with the US over how it supervises the auditing of Chinese companies, which could prevent these firms from being delisted from American bourses in three years if they do not share their audits for review. China has long denied US securities regulators the ability to inspect the financial audits of its US-listed companies, saying they contain state secrets. Chinese law bars financial institutions, including accounting, audit and legal firms, from providing any securities-related documents to foreign parties without permission. Despite the creation of a pilot scheme for cross-border cooperation in 2016, the PCAOB has not completed any investigation about audit work done on US-listed Chinese companies because Beijing refuses to allow the US regulator to conduct such routine inspection. As such, the PCAOB report said Hong Kong and mainland China cannot comply with audit inspection requirements under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. A company that fails to comply with this US law for over three consecutive years is subject to delisting. People are seen on Wall Street outside the New York Stock Exchange building in New York City.

Photo: Reuters> While the PCAOB is expected to publish another report about this matter next year, it is still keen to negotiate with mainland Chinese regulators. ""We remain interested in a relationship with [Chinese] authorities that facilitates the access necessary to oversee PCAOB-registered audit firms in mainland China and Hong Kong, consistent with the robust international regulatory cooperation we experience everywhere else in the world,"" said Duane DesParte, acting chairman of PCAOB, in a statement on Thursday. ""To protect investors and to carry out the PCAOB's mandate, our inspectors and investigators need consistent access across all jurisdictions to the audit work performed for public companies in US capital markets."" ""The PCAOB report marks a step on the journey to delist the Chinese issuers should the present situation remain unresolved,"" said Clement Chan, chairman of Hong Kong Association of Registered Public Interested Entity Auditors. ""However, it is not a dead-end yet,"" said Chan, who is managing director of BDO, one of the Hong Kong-based accounting firms identified in the US report. ""The CSRC and PCAOB should continue their efforts to reach a middle ground and overcome this hurdle, as both have the same goal of maintaining a robust and healthy capital equity market."" Local brokers also urge the two sides to reach an agreement as soon as possible. ""It is vital for Hong Kong, as an international financial centre, to give confidence to investors,"" said Tom Chan Pak-lam, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute Securities Dealers, an industry body of local brokerage houses. ""There are a lot of US-listed Chinese companies that have dual primary listing or secondary listing in Hong Kong. If they were labelled as non-compliant with the US regulation, it will affect investors' confidence in these companies."" Representatives of other accounting firms, the Hong Kong government and local regulator the Financial Reporting Council did not comment. Earlier this month, Christopher Hui Ching-yu, the city's Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury denied claims that Hong Kong was not cooperating with US authorities.

12/20/2021,"If you feel like you're seeing that shiny metal ""T"" more on the road, you're not mistaken. Electric vehicles sales are soaring, and Tesla is leading the charge. The number of newly registered electrical vehicles in the U.S. more than doubled in the first half of 2021 compared to the same time last year, says a recent report by Experian. Elon Musk's car company commands a nearly 66% share. But even though many Americans have decided a Tesla is worth the high sticker price, they could be in for a shock when they try to find affordable insurance for these technological and ecological marvels. While you’re going to save about $250 a month on gas, any electric vehicle will generally cost you more to insure. Why is that? Car insurance companies come up with rates based on a whole range of factors. So even if you have a spotless driving record, live in a low-crime area and take advantage of some driving discounts, your rate is still likely to go up compared to your gas-powered car. That’s because electric vehicles cost more outright and are more expensive to repair. The insurance company may deem you low risk to file a claim, but if anything happens to your car, it’s going to mean costly repairs. So your premiums are set high to reflect that risk. If your premium with a gas-powered car is $1,000 a year, you’ll probably pay $1,180 to $1,320 with an electric car, according to ValuePenguin. As a luxury car, Teslas are pricier still. Motortrend has studied how much it would cost each year to insure the various Tesla models available. Among other factors, these averages assume the owner is a single 40-year-old man with a clean record and good credit score: Tesla Model 3: $2,114-$2,351 Tesla Model S: $3,673-$4,143 Tesla Model Y: $2,118-$2,227 Tesla Model X: $3,355-$4,025 And other car companies, including Chevrolet and Ford, are making gains against Tesla in the EV market, so be aware of the potential for higher insurance costs across the brands. Of course, your rates will vary from insurer to insurer — which is why you should always compare quotes from multiple insurers. Most electric cars generally cost more to buy than standard vehicles. And when they’re damaged, you may have a harder time finding a mechanic qualified to repair them — in addition to requiring more expensive and difficult-to-source parts. Damaged batteries can add to your repair costs. If your battery’s leaking, your mechanic will have to take extra precautionary measures, which will be reflected in your bill. There’s also the need for a charging station. You should expect to have to pay somewhere in the range of $200 to $1,000 to install your own charging station before you hit the road. Nevertheless, you can expect your new car to incur lower maintenance expenses overall. Electric cars also don’t need frequent oil changes or replacement radiator hoses, fan belts or gaskets. So even with slightly higher insurance, your car budget shouldn’t have to change drastically. If you do purchase a Tesla or another EV and begin the process of switching over your insurance policy, don’t forget to ask your insurer if there are any promotions or discounts you can take advantage of to lower your costs. You may be able to bundle your other policies, like home insurance or life insurance. Insurance companies often give discounts to safe drivers with clean records. Don’t be afraid to ask in case you’ve missed something in your own research. But your best option to find savings when you’re looking for car insurance is to shop around for rates. The Insurance Information Institute recommends you seek out at least three quotes before settling on an offer. Some studies show shopping around can save you up to $1,100 a year on auto insurance. With that done, you’ll feel all the power of sitting in the driver’s seat even when you’re not behind the wheel. This article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.
