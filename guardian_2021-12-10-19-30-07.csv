12/10/2021,"Following their convincing 7-1 victory over Sporting Khalsa in the first round, Wolves faced fellow third-tier side Nottingham Forest in the next round. The teams had met in the Women’s National League – Premier Division North – three months previously with Wolves winning 1-0.  Regarding attendance today, it’s an unknown quantity. They have had attendances over 650 earlier this season, but the average has been about 300, something like that. I don’t know about today; with the terrible weather we’ve had recently that may affect it. Hopefully the fact that it’s an FA Cup match, it may be a lot more, you never know. The bar has been very successful this season with the big crowds they’ve had coming in, and it’s also a pleasure to work the bar as some great people come down here, it’s very enjoyable. Wolves used to play here quite a while ago, 2009 I think they used to play. They’ve come back again recently, and the standard has improved dramatically on the pitch and off the pitch, with all the people that are involved in running it now, it’s a major operation and it’s great to be involved with it as a football club ourselves. – Paul Tudor, bar manager at CKW Stadium, home of AFC Wulfrunians The visitors started brightly, pinning Wolves in their own half for much of the opening stage. After going close on two occasions – hitting the side netting and the woodwork – Forest’s Mai Moncaster opened the scoring in the 19th minute, beating the Wolves keeper Becky Thomas at her near post from a tight angle. Wolves chase the game but this leaves holes at the back, which are exploited by Niamh Reynolds in the 66th minute and Katie Middleton in the final minute of the game, to make it 4-0. The final whistle brings a 4-0 victory for Nottingham Forest and a chance for fans to take pictures and get autographs of the players. Forest manager Andy Cook said of their third successive 4-0 victory in all competitions “It was a fantastic performance and we are really pleased to get through. We would have taken a scruffy 1-0 win or we would have even taken going through on penalties, but to perform like that and score four goals is fantastic.

12/10/2021,"Investing in Lego is more lucrative than gold, art and wine, according to a study. It found that the market for secondhand Lego rises in value by 11% annually, which it says is a faster and better rate of return than gold, stocks, bonds, stamps and wine.  Researchers at the Higher School of Economics in Russia said that there could be lucrative gains to be made from investing in “more unusual goods whose purchase might seem less serious”, such as Lego sets, Barbie dolls, superhero mini figures, or model cars and trains. “We are used to thinking that people buy such items as jewellery, antiques or artworks as an investment,” said Victoria Dobrynskaya, an associate professor at the Faculty of Economic Sciences at HSE. “However, there are other options, such as collectible toys. Tens of thousands of deals are made on the secondary Lego market. Even taking into account the small prices of most sets, this is a huge market that is not well known by traditional investors.” The most expensive sets include the Millennium Falcon, Death Star II and Imperial Star Destroyer from Star Wars, as well as the Taj Mahal. The study, which looked at the prices of 2,322 Lego sets from 1987 to 2015, said that factors such as a limited production run, collector special editions, and scarcity on the secondhand market have served to significantly boost prices over the years. Only sales of new unopened sets were selected. “Sets produced 20-30 years ago make Lego fans nostalgic, and prices for them go through the roof,” Dobrynskaya said. “But despite the high profitability of Lego sets on the secondary market in general, not all sets are equally successful. One must be a real Lego fan to sort out the market nuances and see the investment potential in a particular set.” Last month, Lego, the world’s largest toymaker, awarded its 20,000 staff three extra days holiday and a special bonuses after reporting a bumper year of revenues and profits as its sales soared during the coronavirus pandemic lockdowns.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Investing in Lego more lucrative than gold, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/10/investing-in-lego-more-lucrative-than-gold-study-suggests
12/10/2021,"Evidence has been piling up showing that many everyday items found in US homes contain toxic chemicals that are linked to a whole host of serious health problems. Yet these chemicals are poorly regulated, making it hard for consumers to spot and avoid them. Reporting on the chemical industry for the Guardian has helped me identify red flags I look for when shopping. Last Christmas, for example, my sister gave me a small, water-resistant backpack to carry my laptop on long bike trips. It was a thoughtful gift, but the “waterproof” label on the packaging tipped me to a potential danger. Companies commonly use highly toxic chemicals called PFAS to waterproof products, and a quick search revealed that the bag contained them. I politely explained the situation to my sister, returned the bag and found another that is PFAS-free.  Toxic chemicals are ubiquitous and regulators often fail to protect consumers, with loophole-ridden laws or lax enforcement of rules. Companies conceal their use of harmful substances while the EPA hasn’t rejected any new compounds that industry has cooked up in recent years, even when science shows that the chemicals may be dangerous. With the holidays upon us, here are a few rules of thumb that can help consumers avoid buying gifts that may poison a loved one this holiday season. Camping gear, shoes, coats, clothing, umbrellas, car seats, furniture, snow gear, sports accessories, performance textiles and more are commonly waterproofed with PFAS, which serve a similar purpose in makeup and personal care products. The chemicals have been linked to cancer, birth defects, kidney disease, decreased immunity and other serious diseases. When used to waterproof products, PFAS form a water-repellant barrier that looks similar to a shag carpet. But the pieces of “shag” break off over time as the barrier wears off. The chemicals end up in the air or on the ground in dust, and are either breathed in or ingested. PFAS can also be absorbed through skin if they’re on a garment, or when they’re applied via personal care products. It’s difficult to know which items contain PFAS because most companies don’t disclose their use, and the federal government doesn’t regulate them. However, products that contain Gore-Tex and Teflon probably contain PFAS, and customers can call companies to ask for clarification. As the chemicals’ dangers become clearer, more brands are ditching them, and they usually advertise their decision. Look for waterproof products that are labeled “PFAS-free” or “PFC-free”. Beware of those that are advertised as “PFOS-free’’ or “PFOA-free”, as they can still contain other kinds of PFAS. Several consumer groups have pulled together useful lists of retailers selling PFAS-free products. Despite its well-established neurotoxic dangers, lead is still widely used and can be found lurking in crayons, pottery, jewelry, ceramics, dishes, furniture, cookware, some modern toys, many vintage toys, water bottles, coffee mugs and more. Companies still employ the heavy metal as an agent in dyes or glazes to enhance and brighten colors. Avoiding it is difficult because manufacturers typically don’t disclose its use, and the law permits its application with some not-so-stringent stipulations. But there are some basic steps that can be taken to avoid lead, such as finding alternatives to glazed or enameled kitchenware or ceramics. Stainless steel, glass and some kinds of wood are typically safer, though those come with caveats – for example, the glue in many bamboo products contains formaldehyde. In the absence of meaningful lead oversight, a network of blogs have been testing hundreds of products from crayons to pans, and offer troves of helpful guidance. (The Guardian hasn’t independently verified their testing methods.) Few words on a label have as broad a definition as “fragrance” – the fragrance industry uses more than 4,000 chemicals to scent products. A consumer group has flagged at least 1,600 of those as potentially harmful, including chemicals that are banned in other countries, carcinogens and endocrine disruptors found to be harmful in small amounts. That can lead to migraines and respiratory problems, and consumer advocates suspect they could be linked to more serious diseases like cancer. Women endure a higher load of fragrance chemicals because of their common use in personal care products. The regulatory black hole leaves consumers guessing, but several helpful guides offer suggestions and tips for finding personal care products that use only non-toxic ingredients. Though essential oils are a safer alternative, some are stored in bins that contain PFAS, and experts fear the oil could be contaminated. The best policy: when possible, buy unscented or fragrance-free personal care products. Nonstick coatings like Teflon make meal prep much easier, but they’re often composed of toxic PFAS or other unsavory chemicals. Fortunately, there are abundant safe alternatives. Glass, stainless steel and cast iron cookware all work well with a little olive oil and pose very few risks. While ceramic and glazed kitchenware are also popular and billed as nonstick, they often contain heavy metals. Be skeptical of cookware marketing: Even though a company claims its products are free of dangerous chemicals, they may not be. Look for “PFAS-free” or “PFC-free” items and beware of those labeled PFOS- or PFOA-free as they can still contain other kinds of PFAS. A new generation of “green” nonstick pans use silicone coatings, but those often have aluminum substrates. That can be a problem if silicon surfaces are scratched or deteriorate over time. Aside from filling the oceans and earth with garbage that takes eons to degrade, a new study this year found plastic is packed with far more toxic chemicals than previously known. While the health effects of some of those are unclear, chemicals commonly found in plastic, like bisphenol-A (BPA) and phthalates are linked to cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and other serious health issues. There’s virtually no oversight to speak of, so the best policy is to avoid it altogether, and doing so is relatively easy and inexpensive. Instead of plastic kitchenware, consider products made of glass, stainless steel or wood. Food items stored in plastic will almost certainly leach some of packaging’s chemicals, so, if possible, buy the brand that uses glass jars. It’s more difficult to avoid plastic toys, but consumer groups offer a few tips. And if you can’t find an alternative to the plastic toy that your child wants, consider that science has found that kids don’t need so many toys.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Be wary of waterproof, and other tips to keep toxic chemicals out of your holiday gifts",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/10/psfas-toxic-chemicals-holiday-gifts-tips
12/10/2021,"Three years before launching Bridal Babes – a bridal e-commerce boutique that caters to Black and brown wedding parties – Ashley Young was just another Black bride trying to find the perfect bridesmaid dresses. “My girls were of all shapes and sizes, and they wanted to show off the melanin and show off the curves,” Young, the company’s CEO and co-founder, recalls. “We needed sexy, form-fitting dresses in bold, bright colors.” But traditional bridal shops fell short. Young took her search off of the beaten path, eventually finding a strappy, figure-hugging design in a sumptuous coral shade that worked with each of her bridesmaids’ complexions. Young realized then that there was a gap to be filled in the $57bn US wedding industry and, in 2019, Bridal Babes was born.  Young and her husband, Charles, completely bootstrapped the business. Their efforts quickly paid off, thanks in part to the brand’s innovative virtual consultation services and remote, online showcases – services that would later become industry standard due to Covid. “I like to brag that we were doing virtual consultations a year before David’s Bridal got with the program and launched theirs,” Young says. Being ahead of the curve gave Bridal Babes its first profitable year in 2020, and Young says that the brand is on track to turn a $1m profit for 2021. And that’s just the beginning. What do you think is driving the success of Bridal Babes? Young: We found this niche. Women of color and women with curves are often overlooked in the bridal industry. These women are in their twenties and early thirties, sometimes even younger, and they want to show off. I think having people that are thinking of women of color as they’re developing the product selection is vital. In our culture, curves are celebrated; we don’t want to mask them or hide under a big tent. When we’re modeling plus-size clothing we use a real plus-size model, not a size 14. People appreciate that because they want to know what they will look like in the dress. Bridal Babes had its first profitable year during the height of the pandemic. How did you adjust your business to be successful despite all the restrictions of 2020? Young: We have an online network of over 65,000 brides of color who tell us what they want. They were telling us they wanted bridal shower dresses, courthouse dresses, and T-shirts to show off their new status as wives. So even though people weren’t having big weddings, they were still getting married, and they told us how we could still pivot and be profitable. We listened to them and made the shifts in our inventory. What’s your husband’s role in the company? Young: We are co-founders and he quit his job to run the business. People see him and are surprised he’s in bridal, but he definitely manages more of the logistics and operations side as the president and COO. As you can imagine, we get thousands of dresses from our production facility each month, and they have to go out to our customers. So, he manages all the supply chain issues and the inventory issues. What does it mean to you to build this business with your spouse? Young: We want to be an example for Black love and Black families. Many of us in the Black community don’t see entrepreneurship in the way the general public sees it. We haven’t always had models to show us the value of providing jobs for your community and providing jobs for your family, and potentially selling your business or having an IPO that can create millions upon millions of dollars. Growing this business to provide a legacy and generational wealth for our family is important, and helping our community figure out ways to do that for themselves is at the heart of what we’re doing.",News/Business,"‘Show off the melanin, show off the curves’ : Bridal Babes boutique centers brides of color",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/dec/10/brides-women-of-color-wedding-dresses

12/10/2021,"Alot of people with a lot of power don’t see why women should have jurisdiction over their own bodies. That’s the anti-abortion argument in a nutshell, in that they claim a foetus, or even an embryo, or in some cases even a fertilised egg too small for the human eye to see, has rights that supersede those of the person inside whose body that egg, embryo or foetus might be. What was clear from the rightwing pundits and conservative supreme court justices who have piped up over the last month as arguments were being heard in the most significant abortion rights case since Roe v Wade, is that in a country whose constitution is supposed to grant us all a lot of rights, they are happy to strip away a right so fundamental it’s unimaginable in other circumstances – or that it would be stripped from other people, namely men. In the case, Dobbs v Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the state of Mississippi is asking the court to rule on whether it can outlaw abortions after 15 weeks’ gestation. They are asking, in other words, for the right to punish women for being women.  The goal of the anti-abortionists seems to be to enhance men’s privileges by undermining women’s rights, by making us separate and unequal. (People who do not identify as female also get pregnant and bear children, but the animosity is directed at women and girls, so I’m going to talk about women and girls here.) Since acknowledging this would undermine the anti-abortion case, the emphasis is instead shifted to someone else whose rights are claimed to trump those of pregnant people, the unborn. The unborn are a convenient constituency to advocate for, since they have no voice or vote and anyone can claim to speak for them. Those who claim to protect the unborn are largely conservatives who routinely reject universal access to healthcare, let alone meeting the basic material needs of babies and children with food, clothing, shelter and daycare. They also usually oppose reproductive education, including by defunding and demonising Planned Parenthood (which is where, as a teen, I got the reproductive care that protected me from an unwanted pregnancy). This is how we know that foetuses are not the real subject here. Miscarriages are not generally regarded by anti-abortionists as a loss of human life, unless it’s to criminalise women, some of whom have been sent to prison for miscarrying after allegedly endangering foetuses through their actions. Substance use in pregnancy is considered child abuse in 23 US states, but no one will go to prison for endangering both mother and child through denial of basic needs. Accounts suggest that most of the women being punished under these laws are women of colour. It is widely known that abortion restrictions primarily punish poor and minority-ethnic people too. Wanted pregnancies are often the occasion for impregnators to preen themselves and be congratulated, but unwanted pregnancies are treated as something wicked that women do all on their own. No man is punished under the law for unwanted pregnancy, though a significant percentage of such pregnancies are the result of sexual coercion and refusing to cooperate with birth control. Then there is the risk of homicide – one study showed that 8.4% of reported maternal mortality deaths were murders – with African American women seven times more likely to die this way than white women. The largest proportion of these cases occur at the hands of a partner. There is no other experience that could be so brutal physically and psychologically, could disable for months or result in permanent disability and injury, or even death, that anyone says an individual must undergo when there is a clear and comparatively safe alternative. (Maybe the military draft in times of war is the closest equivalent when it comes to risk and loss of self-determination, and I’m against that too.) Wanted pregnancies and births can be wonderful as well as intense, and I know plenty of people who experienced it that way. But pregnancy and birth can also be, as one of my friends who is the mother of two teens put it, harrowing. I remember a friend’s first pregnancy when she couldn’t stop throwing up, know of people who were bedridden for months, have heard of pelvic bones that broke, hips that came out of their sockets, chronic pain, cases of eclampsia that were life-threatening or fatal, miscarriages that led to haemorrhages. “Women in our nation are dying -- before, during and after childbirth,” said Kamala Harris this week announcing significant investment in maternal health. “In the United States of America, in the 21st century, being pregnant and giving birth should not carry such great risk.” We all know the sheer awkwardness of people in their third trimester who are heavily laden, often exhausted, in a body so transformed in size and function that it no longer feels like their own. To make someone undergo that involuntarily is punitive. To argue that pregnancy doesn’t really disrupt a life is ridiculous, but the supreme court’s Amy Coney Barrett did so when, during the hearing, she asked why the fact that babies could be given up at birth didn’t relieve women of the burden, arguing that if “forced parenting, forced motherhood, would hinder women’s access to the workplace and to equal opportunities … why don’t the safe haven laws take care of that problem?” Imagine telling a woman working as a janitor or a dancer or a farmer or trying to make law partner or compete in her sport that she’s unimpaired by her visibly changing body – and the physical and psychological impacts of it – because she can give away the baby at birth without being criminalised for it? It was also stunning that Barrett recognised that the subject was “forced motherhood”. Given that the majority of abortions are for women who already have children, imagine the impact on the other children of watching their mother go through an unwanted pregnancy and birth. A lot of women choose abortion out of love for their existing children and the desire to parent them as well as possible. The literature of early birth control advocates is full of the desperation of women who could not cope with the physical impact of another pregnancy and birth and the economic burden and workload of another child to care for. Medical providers I know who worked in a remote part of the Himalayas told me of women who came to them for birth control, swearing they would rather die than have another child. With illegal abortions, an alarming percentage of women do die. The mother of another friend of mine died giving birth to that friend’s younger sister, and I know of the brutality of caesarean sections, of 36-hour labours, of the rips and tears of vaginal birth that can cause incontinence, fistulas, and other permanent injuries. The hormonal changes are changes in consciousness, and for people whose wellbeing is already fragile, the experience can be devastating, and when it’s an unwanted pregnancy it can be more than that. The experience of bringing a new human life into the world is profound, and to make it involuntary is monstrous. Denying abortion without exceptions is saying that it’s fine for a child impregnated by her father to have to carry the child to term. We don’t force anyone to donate a kidney to someone dying of kidney failure; forcing someone to donate their body as an incubator is also an outrage. The late-term abortions that get so much attention are both rare and usually because the foetus is dead, not viable, or the mother’s life is at risk. Ireland’s voters legalised abortion after a dentist in Galway undergoing a miscarriage was unable to have the abortion that would have saved her from death. The lawyer arguing the case before the supreme court for women’s reproductive rights answered Barrett’s blithe nonsense thus: “Pregnancy itself is unique. It imposes unique physical demands and risks on women and, in fact, has impact on all of their lives, on their ability to care for other children, other family members, on their ability to work. And, in particular, in Mississippi, those risks are alarmingly high. It’s 75 times more dangerous to give birth in Mississippi … than it is to have a pre-viability abortion, and those risks are disproportionately threatening the lives of women of colour.” Or as the supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor put it, “So when does the life of a woman and putting her at risk enter the calculus?” She knew, we know, that for those who are committed to the punitive violence of forced birth the answer is: never.

12/10/2021,"The CIA considered him Che Guevara’s successor when it came to igniting new guerrilla movements in Latin America. Brazil’s military dictatorship, whose security agents ambushed and killed him in São Paulo in 1969, called him public enemy No 1.  Now, more than five decades after his slaying, the communist revolutionary and poet Carlos Marighella has been reborn as a symbol of political resistance to Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right administration thanks to a new film about his life. When the lights come up at the end of sessions of Marighella, it is common to hear anti-Bolsonaro chants from cinema-goers, inflamed by the film and their anger at Brazil’s dictatorship-admiring president, whom many blame for a Covid disaster that has killed more than 615,000 people. “Marighella is the antagonist supreme when you compare him to Bolsonaro – and this all erupts in the cinema,” said Mário Magalhães, whose biography of the rebel, Marighella: The Guerrilla Who Set the World Alight, inspired the film. One of the founders of the rebel group National Liberation Action (ALN), Marighella was the key exponent of more radical resistance to Brazil’s 1964-85 dictatorship at a time when being a leftist was punishable with death. Today, he is despised by Brazil’s extreme right for his leading role in the armed struggle against its military rulers, who killed at least 434 opponents and tortured thousands more in a bid to silence their opponents. How did it begin? Brazil’s leftist president, João Goulart, was toppled in a coup in April 1964. General Humberto Castelo Branco became leader, political parties were banned, and the country was plunged into 21 years of military rule. The repression intensified under Castelo Branco’s hardline successor, Artur da Costa e Silva, who took power in 1967. He was responsible for a notorious decree called AI-5 that gave him wide ranging dictatorial powers and kicked off the so-called “anos de chumbo” (years of lead), a bleak period of tyranny and violence which would last until 1974. What happened during the dictatorship? Supporters of Brazil’s 1964-1985 military regime - including Jair Bolsonaro - credit it with bringing security and stability to the South American country and masterminding a decade-long economic “miracle”. It also pushed ahead with several pharaonic infrastructure projects including the still unfinished Trans-Amazonian highway and the eight-mile bridge across Rio’s Guanabara bay. But the regime, while less notoriously violent than those in Argentina and Chile, was also responsible for murdering or killing hundreds of its opponents and imprisoning thousands more. Among those jailed and tortured were Brazil’s first female president, Dilma Rousseff, then a leftwing rebel. It was also a period of severe censorship. Some of Brazil’s best-loved musicians - including Gilberto Gil, Chico Buarque and Caetano Veloso - went into exile in Europe, writing songs about their enforced departures. How did it end? Political exiles began returning to Brazil in 1979 after an amnesty law was passed that began to pave the way for the return of democracy. But the pro-democracy “Diretas Já” (Direct elections now!) movement only hit its stride in 1984 with a series of vast and historic street rallies in cities such as Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Belo Horizonte. Civilian rule returned the following year and a new constitution was introduced in 1988. The following year Brazil held its first direct presidential election in nearly three decades. Marighella’s story was little known in and outside of Brazil until 2012, when Magalhães’s biography was published and the subject’s granddaughter gave a copy to the Narcos star Wagner Moura, reportedly telling him: “We’ve got to make a film.” For years the Brazilian actor, who played Pablo Escobar in that Netflix series, tried to do just that, in what was his first film as a director. But in a sign of the increasingly authoritarian political climate that has engulfed Brazil under Bolsonaro, a former army captain who reveres the dictatorship’s generals and torturers, the 155-minute film only hit Brazilian screens last month. The film premiered at the Berlin film festival in early 2019 but its Brazilian debut was repeatedly cancelled by the government film agency Ancine over supposed bureaucratic issues, which the film’s director denounced as “an absolutely clear case of censorship”. “The cries you hear in the cinema are also a political reaction to efforts to censor the film,” said Magalhães, the biographer. “It’s a democratic celebration against intolerance and against an authoritarian government which caused the deaths of millions of people during the pandemic.” Marighella’s producers have emphasized the protagonist’s continued political relevance at a moment when another South American struggle for democracy is under way, as Brazil’s gears up for a presidential election next year. The film’s Brazilian premiere took place at a camp organized by Brazil’s Landless Rural Workers Movement (MST), in Bahia state, where both Marighella and Moura were born. Lucinéia Durães, an MST director who was among the 3,000-strong audience, said that several days before the screening, masked men had launched an attack on another nearby landless people’s camp, firing shots and burning six vehicles. Durães said such attacks, which she blamed on far-right pro-Bolsonaro groups, were common. “Marighella has again become a symbol because his struggle is our struggle,” Durães said. “We see today’s Brazil when we watch the film, a Brazil in which those who fight are seen as criminals. “Marighella was accused of terrorism. So are we. But all we want to do is democratize the land and for every single Brazilian to be able to eat and have a home,” added Durães, who believed the film’s key message was that “fighters died, but the dream of their struggle lives on”. “We must keep fighting for a democracy that represents Black and indigenous citizens,” she said. Last week the film was shown at the ABC Metalworkers Union in São Paulo, where Bolsonaro’s key rival, the leftist former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, gave a speech beneath a banner reading: “Viva Marighella”. “We must venerate and broadcast the meaning of the struggle of those who, like Marighella, died to ensure that the Brazilian people could live democratically,” said Lula, who polls suggest will defeat Bolsonaro next year. Lula called “companheiro Marighella” part of a long line of Brazilian rebel heroes, including the 17th century anti-slavery resistance leaders Zumbi and Dandara, whose stories had for too long been smothered. “It is up to us to retell a little bit of this country’s history,” Lula told filmgoers.",News/World news,‘His struggle is ours’: biopic of slain 60s rebel hailed in Brazil with anti-Bolsonaro chants,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/10/carlos-marighella-film-brazil-jair-bolsonaro
12/10/2021,"Speculation has surrounded the choice of the next actor to play James Bond after Daniel Craig hung up his tux with No Time to Die. On 7 December Barbara Broccoli, producer of the Bond franchise, told Hollywood Reporter that the candidate should be a British man of any ethnicity or race. Guardian readers share their take on which British actor should be the next 007.  ‘He is the one – we all know it’Who else other than Idris Elba? He has everything – charisma, presence and confidence. In Luther he showed us how much he can play a tormented soul. I don’t have anything else to say. Just look at him, he is the one. I know it, you know it, we all know it. Emeric Pierre, state worker, France ‘Fleming’s image of Bond’He is very like Fleming’s image of Bond – and unlike others, he can act. He is also very cool and suave in the way that Bond is supposed to be. Morag, charity worker, Kirkcaldy ‘Gravitas and presence’He is a good actor and has had commanding roles such as Superman. He has something of the same brooding presence that Daniel Craig had in the role. The last Mission: Impossible movie shows he’s got quite a range and has the ability to play different roles. I think he would quickly grow into the role of Bond. He was interviewed by Lorraine Kelly on TV earlier this week and I was impressed by his gravitas and presence. Robert, retired civil servant, Devon ‘There is a suaveness about him’He is a good actor, has a beautiful voice and is very good looking. There is a suaveness about him that goes with the Bond character, yet he looks tough enough to do the job. We loved Daniel Craig, but it might be good to see how Cavill approaches the role. I sincerely hope they choose him. Nadine Gardner, retired, Melbourne ‘Streets ahead of anyone else’I’d be very excited if Tom Hardy was given the role. Craig has raised the bar in so many ways. Maybe Hardy is “more of the same”, but he’s just such a top actor. Streets ahead of anyone else and the obvious choice for me. Brett Turner, videographer, Dubai ‘Gritty and comedic’His gritty and comedic performance as Alfie Solomons [in Peaky Blinders] suits the style I believe a modern James Bond needs. I think Bond needs to be both. The one-liners and cheese of the older films shouldn’t be forgotten and need to be cherished. George Hexton, estimating and design manager, Lincolnshire ‘He would bring a unique intensity’He’s an absolutely phenomenal actor and would bring a unique intensity to the role, as well as a truly modern sensibility, something that was lacking even in the Craig films. Tony McCarney, data engineering consultant, Coventry ‘He represents intersecting British identities’He’s young and a good actor. He can do the thoughtful parts of Bond as well as the action, and represents today’s intersecting British identities very well. Chris Oxley, psychologist, Ottawa ‘Charismatic as hell’He’s a bit “on the nose”, admittedly, but I think he ticks all the boxes. He looks the part, is charismatic as hell and fundamentally looks like, if the mood took him, he could kill or shag anyone in the room – which is the acid test for any Bond actor. With the right script he could be another Dalton. I may be biased, but I’d love a Scot to take the role back. Mike Prior, financial services worker, Glasgow ‘Could bring that classy status’His role in Bodyguard was a very clear sample of his chances as a Licence to Kill match. Bond roles require more than a pretty face. Madden is young, has that hard face, and could bring that classy status required by the classic character Ian Fleming wrote. Octavio Maya Rocha, filmmaker, Mexico City ‘He could play a younger, more arrogant Bond’Bringing a young, fresh approach to the films, Asa Butterfield would be an unconventional and unexpected choice. He could play a younger, more arrogant Bond, who is new to the secret service and must learn and grow as he completes his first missions and first kills. Harriet, fashion student, London ‘A growing talent’A growing talent who will be stepping up rather than sideways to play the role. Golding is well known for Crazy Rich Asians but anyone who saw him in The Gentlemen got to see a dangerous but sleek presence who could bring a grit and humanity to a younger Bond, while perhaps bringing some much-needed humour to the franchise. Anonymous civil servant, Kent ‘A British-Asian Bond would be a welcome leap’I think it’s time for Bond to diversify from the British white man, and a British-Asian Bond would be welcome. Golding has been fantastic in recent roles which are adjacent to Bond, like Snake Eyes and The Gentlemen. Aaron, 24, Northern Ireland ‘Better looking than the recent ones’I’ve followed Isaacs’ career with interest. He can play anything: posh diplomat, Irish-American gangster (in the fantastic crime drama series Brotherhood), psychopath, starship captain or private eye. Everyone says he’s too old to be the next Bond but he’s still better looking and has more screen presence that most of the recent ones. You could see him go from playing a terrifying psychopath to a serious British ambassador to the US, all in the same week. Stephen Haigh, retired animator, London ‘He has the dangerous physical edge’He’s got action and genre experience, but is still a relative unknown. He’s the right build, looks great in a tux, and is young enough to carry the franchise for about 15 years, as Craig did, if he wants to. He’s also a very good actor. I don’t think there’s any doubt he possesses the dangerous physical edge that Connery and Craig had, the suave manner that Brosnan had, and the cruel coldness that Dalton brought when it was needed. Hugh Parker, architect, East Ayrshire ‘Exit blond Bond, enter red Bond!’There are plenty of great contenders for the next Bond, and I’m well on board for promoting diversity. With this in mind, why not give it to Damian Lewis, supported by the red-haired ticket? Red-haired actors are at best typecast as a bumbling, comedic sidekick, and at worst written out completely. So why not do the right thing, and the best thing – exit blond Bond, enter red Bond!

12/10/2021,"The 1982 video-nasty classic The Slumber Party Massacre – a confection of polyester sleepwear, orangey fake blood and phallic construction equipment with remarkable battery longevity, directed by Amy Jones – gets a reboot for a new generation with this, along with a more euphonious title, shorn of the definitive article. This time the director is Danishka Esterhazy, whose previous feature, The Banana Splits Movie, similarly retweaked a near-forgotten property from the pop-culture landfill. After an 80s-set prologue that establishes driller killer Russ Thorn’s (Rob van Vuuren) stalk-and-skewer modus operandi, we catch up with lone survivor Trish Deveraux (Schelaine Bennett) in the present day. Trish is now a paranoid parent, worriedly sending off her only daughter Dana (Hannah Gonera, delightful) off for a rustic overnighter with her friends. Will history repeat itself? Not quite. Esterhazy and co have a few clever-ish tricks up their sleeves that invert viewer expectations. First and foremost is having a second slumber party in full swing across the lake, this one featuring a house full of beefcake boys, all lovingly filmed ripped abs and tousled hair, sinking beers and wantonly conducting pillow fights. The young women, on the other hand, are ready for trouble and therefore much slower to be picked off by the serial killer predator.  It all playfully flirts with horror film conventions, offering up a winking orgy of patently fake gore and irony that’s for the most part pretty fun. At least the cast seem well in on the joke and are clearly having a blast, although the package could have been improved with a fewer sharper one-liners and tauter comic timing. At least the cinematography is period accurate, resembling low-budget Betamax from the last century filmed with smudged lenses.  Slumber Party Massacre is released on 13 December on digital platforms.",Arts/Film,Slumber Party Massacre review – video nasty reboot puts some fun in sleepover carnage,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/08/slumber-party-massacre-review-video-nasty-back-from-dead-in-better-mood
