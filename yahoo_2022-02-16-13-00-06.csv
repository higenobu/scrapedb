2/16/2022,"By Jose Torres TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) -A dozen undocumented migrants on Mexico's southern border sewed their mouths shut on Tuesday in a bid to convince the country's immigration authority to grant them passage toward the U.S. border. The migrants, mostly Central and South Americans, helped each other seal their lips using needles and plastic threads, leaving a small space to consume liquids and using alcohol to wipe away drops of blood from the stitches, Reuters images show. ""The migrants are sewing their lips together as a sign of protest,"" said Irineo Mujica, an activist at the demonstration. ""We hope that the National Migration Institute can see that they are bleeding, that they are human beings."" Mexico's migration agency (INM) said in a public statement that ""it is worrying that these measures have been carried out with the consent and support of those who call themselves their representatives, with the intention of pressuring authorities on an attention already provided."" Some were carrying their children when they staged the dramatic protest in Tapachula, a border city with Guatemala, which for months has been filled with thousands of migrants waiting for papers to be able to freely cross the country. ""I'm doing it for my daughter,"" said Yorgelis Rivera, a Venezuelan. ""She has not eaten anything in the last few hours and I see no solution ... from the authorities."" ""We are like prisoners here,"" Rivera said, adding she has been waiting for a response from Mexico's migration agency for more than a month. The agency said it continues to attend cases, adding priority is has been given to those who make up vulnerable groups, such as children, adolescents, pregnant women, victims of crime, people with disabilities and the elderly. The institution said it receives more than a hundred applicants at their offices in the southern city every day. In recent years, the number of migrants arriving in Mexico fleeing violence and poverty has jumped. In 2021, Mexico recorded an 87% increase in the number of asylum applications, mainly from Haitians and Hondurans. The United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR) recently said Mexico should consider new aid programs amid a surge in the arrival of foreigners, many of them Venezuelans, for whom Mexico now requires a visa.

2/16/2022,"A top official of India's central bank has compared cryptocurrency to a ""Ponzi scheme"" and suggested an outright ban in its sharpest criticism just weeks after the government proposed taxation of the virtual digital asset and paved way to recognize it as legal tender in the world's second-largest internet market. T. Rabi Sankar, deputy governor of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), told an audience at a banking conference that cryptocurrencies have been ""specifically developed to bypass the regulated financial system,"" and are not backed by any underlying cash flow. ""We have also seen that cryptocurrencies are not amenable to definition as a currency, asset or commodity; they have no underlying cash flows, they have no intrinsic value; that they are akin to Ponzi schemes, and may even be worse,"" he said. Sankar's remarks come at a time the Indian government has sent signals that it's moving in the direction of recognizing the digital virtual asset as legal tender. The nation's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed taxing income accrued from transfer of cryptocurrencies and NFTs in the federal budget early this month. The sale of cryptocurrencies and NFTs have made quick inroads in India in the past year despite regulatory uncertainty. The world's second-largest internet market has seen the second-highest adoption rate for cryptocurrency investments, according to an analysis by research firm Chainalysis. “The magnitude and frequency of these transactions have made it imperative to provide for a specific tax regime,” she said in her budget speech. India's central bank has so far been very cautious about cryptocurrencies. In 2018, it banned financial firms from dealing with cryptocurrency. The ban was overturned by India's Supreme Court two years later, but most banks have continued to follow the RBI's direction. Sitharaman said on Monday that New Delhi and the RBI were holding discussions to formulate rules and that the two were ""onboard."" Sankar's speech has made it clear that the RBI has not changed its long-held stance. ""As a store of value, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have given impressive returns so far, but so did tulips in 17th century Netherlands. Cryptocurrencies are very much like a speculative or gambling contract working like a Ponzi scheme. In fact, it has been argued that the original scheme devised by Charles Ponzi in 1920 is better than cryptocurrencies from a social perspective,"" he said. Cryptocurrencies can ""wreck"" the currency system, the monetary authority, the banking system and in general the government's ability to control the economy, he warned. ""They threaten the financial sovereignty of a country and make it susceptible to strategic manipulation by private corporates creating these currencies or governments that control them. All these factors lead to the conclusion that banning cryptocurrency is perhaps the most advisable choice open to India,"" he said. ""We have examined the arguments proffered by those advocating that cryptocurrencies should be regulated and found that none of them stand up to basic scrutiny.""",Business/TechCrunch,"Cryptocurrency is akin to 'Ponzi scheme' and banning it is 'perhaps the most advisable choice', says India's Central Bank",https://news.yahoo.com/cryptocurrency-ponzi-scheme-banning-perhaps-163358692.html

 Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said on Tuesday that he doesn't support President Biden's pick to fill a district court vacancy in his home state, likely dooming the nomination absent a shift by Democrats. Johnson said that he would oppose William Pocan, who was nominated by Biden to be a district judge in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. It marks the first time during the Biden administration a senator has not returned a blue slip - a piece of paper that indicates if a home-state senator supports a nominee - for a district court nominee. ""Since Judge Pocan's nomination, I have been hearing concerns from the Green Bay legal community that they needed a judge who is locally based and actively involved in their community. That is not the case with Judge Pocan,"" Johnson said in a statement. ""In addition, the tragedy in Waukesha never should have happened. That it did, is the direct result of soft on crime low bail policies and court orders. I cannot support someone for a lifetime appointment that has granted low bail for someone charged with violent felonies. That is not in the best interest of Wisconsinites nor Americans. I look forward to working with President Biden on selecting a suitable nominee,"" he added. Johnson and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) previously recommended Pocan as a potential pick to fill the vacancy. Wisconsin uses a nominating commission that recommends four to six names to the senators, who then formally make recommendations to the president. Typically, district court nominees who don't get blue slips from both home-state senators don't advance in the Senate Judiciary Committee. A spokeswoman for Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the Judiciary Committee chairman, didn't immediately respond to questions about if he will advance the nominee. Though Republicans advanced circuit court nominees during the Trump administration over the objections of both home-state senators, infuriating Democrats, they left the blue slip, which isn't a rule but a Senate precedent, intact for district court nominees. That gives a home-state senator an effective veto over district court nominees from their state. Durbin, during an interview with The New York Times, said that he would stick with the precedent for honoring the blue slip on district court nominees. But he warned at the time that he wouldn't let it be abused to block a nominee because of their race or gender. ""If I think it's reached a point where the blue slip on district court judges is really not a question of temperament or philosophy or academic background and experience, but really gets down to some base issues involving race and gender, I reserve the right to revisit that. I'm not going to be party to that. I am not going to let the blue slip perpetuate prejudice in America,"" Durbin said at the time. Johnson's objection immediately sparked new call from some on the left for Democrats to ignore the blue slip for district judges. ""This bad faith objection eight months after Johnson recommended Pocan is the perfect example of why Biden and Durbin should ignore blue slips even for district courts,"" Christopher Kang, the chief counsel for the progressive group Demand Justice, tweeted.",Politics/The Hill,"GOP senator opposes Biden court pick, likely blocking nominee",https://news.yahoo.com/gop-senator-opposes-biden-court-020151956.html
