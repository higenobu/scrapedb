2/25/2022,"An expert witness believes Kumanjayi Walker posed little or no threat to two police officers when he was shot a second and third time, a court has heard. Walker, a 19-year-old Warlpiri man, died in November 2019 after two Northern Territory police officers attempted to arrest him in Yuendumu, a remote community about 300km from Alice Springs.  One of the officers, constable Zachary Rolfe, is on trial for Walker’s murder in the NT supreme court. The court has previously heard Rolfe shot Walker three times after Walker stabbed him in the shoulder with a pair of scissors. Dr Andrew McIntosh, a biomechanist, gave evidence on Friday that at the time Walker was shot by Rolfe on the second and third occasion, he posed no threat to Rolfe and a low threat to his colleague, Adam Eberl. Rolfe is not charged in relation to the first shot fired at Walker, which occurred only moments after Walker had stabbed him. But it is alleged that when Rolfe fired the second and third shots several seconds later, Walker had either fallen or been wrestled to the ground by Eberl and had his right arm pinned underneath his body. Rolfe has pleaded not guilty and defends his actions on the basis they were justified in light of the risk Walker posed to him and Eberl. The defence also disputes that Walker was under control at the time of the shots. McIntosh, who reviewed body-worn camera footage of the incident and the evidence of other witnesses including Eberl, said it appeared that Walker no longer posed a serious threat to the officers at the time of the later shots because of a range of factors. Under questioning from the prosecutor, Philip Strickland SC, McIntosh said that Walker posed no threat to Rolfe as he was on the ground under Eberl, whereas Rolfe was standing up. Walker posed a low threat to Eberl because the arm that had been holding the scissors was pinned between his body and a mattress on the ground, and Eberl’s body mass was pressing down on top of him, McIntosh said. When cross-examined by David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, McIntosh agreed the body-worn camera footage had limitations. He gave the analogy of “cricket buffs” watching a match on television and being convinced a bowler bent their elbow when bowling, when in reality their arm had not changed position. Edwardson also said that while McIntosh had been able to review the camera footage frame-by-frame, Rolfe and Eberl were assessing the threat in real time. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “They, of course, were dealing with this situation, this dynamic situation, in a matter of seconds … and from their perspective, it might be quite different, as we’ve acknowledged, from the body-worn video,” Edwardson said, to which McIntosh agreed. In reports prepared for the case, McIntosh said it was more likely than not that Walker could have harmed or injured the officers at the time the first shot was fired, but that “the body-worn evidence regarding this threat and the presence of the scissors is inconclusive”. Edwardson said the fact that the scissors could not be seen in the footage until after the third shot was fired demonstrated that Rolfe and Eberl could have seen things that their body-worn cameras did not capture. “That’s a reasonable point, yes,” McIntosh responded.

2/25/2022,"Lawyers for the newspapers being sued by Ben Roberts-Smith told one of his former comrades they would “steer clear” of questioning him about an alleged war crime killing he committed in Afghanistan if he agreed to testify about a key murder allegation against Roberts-Smith, it has been claimed in the federal court. The former SAS soldier, anonymised before court as Person 56, served alongside Roberts-Smith in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2012.  Person 56 has been subpoenaed to give evidence, but is seeking to be excused from appearing. His lawyer told the court he is suffering serious health conditions and has a terminally-ill family member. “Life is a bit of a shit-fight,” the court heard on Friday. Roberts-Smith is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times over reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. In 2009, Person 56 was part of the Gothic 2 patrol commanded by Roberts-Smith that conducted a raid on the village of Darwan, in Afghanistan’s Uruzgan province. The court has heard previously that Person 56 was sent away – ostensibly to return an interpreter to another patrol in the village – during a critical stage of that mission. The newspapers allege in their defence that on that mission Roberts-Smith took an unarmed, handcuffed Afghan farmer, named Ali Jan, forced him to kneel near the edge of a 10-metre cliff, and kicked him off, before being involved in shooting Jan and dumping his body in a nearby field. Roberts-Smith denies the allegations, and has previously told the court “there was no cliff … there was no kick”, and that the man purported to be Ali Jan was an enemy “spotter” who was lawfully killed in a cornfield within the military’s rules of engagement. There is dispute between the newspapers and Roberts-Smith’s legal team about how long Person 56 was separated from his patrol, and where he and the interpreter were during the period that Ali Jan was allegedly in custody and allegedly murdered. Person 56 was also present on an SAS operation in Fasil, in southern Uruzgan province, on 5 November 2012. Last week, the court heard evidence from a soldier who claims Roberts-Smith boasted about shooting a captive, unarmed and handcuffed Afghan teenager who had been a passenger in a ute stopped by Australian troops. The newspapers allege Roberts-Smith shot him with his pistol, and the court heard from a former comrade last week who said Roberts-Smith told him: “I pulled out my 9mm, shot the cunt in the side of the head, blew his brains out. It was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.” Roberts-Smith also denies that allegation, and has told the court he never used his pistol while on deployment in Afghanistan. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The federal court heard on Friday that the newspapers believe Person 56 was also responsible for killing a person during the Fasil mission. An emailed transcript of a phone call from a lawyer for the newspapers to Person 56’s counsel was read into court: “We know that Person 56 was the other person involved in the mission in Fasil and that he was a person who killed somebody.” Lawyers for the newspapers have been seeking, over a number of years, to have Person 56 appear in this trial. Person 56 is seeking to be excused from giving evidence on account of the mental harm it would cause him. Peter Bartlett, counsel for the newspapers, appeared in the witness box on Friday and told the court: “Person 56 was a member of the applicant’s patrol on two crucial missions. We have always taken the view that he would be in possession of information that would be in the benefit of this court.” But Arthur Moses SC, acting for Roberts-Smith, told the court that after Person 56 said he would seek to be excused from his subpoena to give evidence, lawyers for the newspapers approached Person 56’s lawyer seeking an agreement for him to appear if they acceded to only ask about the Darwan mission and not to question him on events at Fasil. “The 5 November incident is hotly contested,” the account of the phone call between one of the newspapers’ lawyers and Person 56’s lawyer said. “The two people killed were killed by Ben Roberts-Smith and a member of his patrol we know to be your client [Person 56]. We think we can steer clear of all that stuff and just limit it to Darwan,” the email cited in court said.

Bartlett, who was not a party to the conversation referred to by Moses, disputed his characterisation of the discussions between the lawyers as a “deal”. Lawyers for Roberts-Smith have argued the agreement goes to the credibility of Person 56’s evidence if a “side deal” has been done with the newspapers. Lawyers for the newspapers have countered they were simply being transparent with the witness, and making a “forensic decision” about which matters to pursue, noting the highly unusual evidence, and the difficulties faced by Person 56 in giving evidence. Nicholas Owens SC, for the newspapers, said the negotiations with Person 56 were “perfectly proper”. “We were willing to engage with Person 56 on the basis that we did not wish to adduce evidence from him that would incriminate him. “This isn’t a ‘tell us everything’, this is a ‘tell us what you are willing to give us’,” he said. Owens told the court that Person 56 had indicated “an objection would be taken to any questioning on any topic other than Darwan on the grounds of [potential] self-incrimination”. “We accept that he has a reasonable basis for anticipating that that evidence would incriminate him. We accepted that we would not apply to have him compelled to give that evidence over his objection,” Owens said. Justice Anthony Besanko asked from the bench: “That’s unusual isn’t it?” Owens replied: “These are unusual circumstances. It is a situation that a witness has information about two matters, but, for reasons that are obvious, is very unwilling to give evidence about the second of those matters.” Sean Richter, acting for Person 56, said the former soldier was seeking to be excused from appearing because giving evidence, particularly about the events at Fasil, would be damaging for his health. The court imposed a suppression order on the nature of his health conditions. Richter said there was “the potential here for further harm to Person 56” and told the court “there needs to be a balancing act between the public interest in having him give evidence as opposed to his personal interests”. Richter said any “deal” with the newspapers’ lawyers about what would be asked would offer “no protection”. “It’s not as simple that the respondents [newspapers] only wish to ask about portions about his military service, there is nothing preventing the applicant’s [Roberts-Smith’s] counsel from going to the remainder of his military service.” Justice Besanko has reserved his decision, likely until next week. The trial resumes Monday.",News/Australia news,Ben Roberts-Smith trial: newspapers’ lawyers deny ‘deal’ with witness to ‘steer clear’ of evidence about alleged killing,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/ben-roberts-smith-trial-newspapers-lawyers-deny-deal-with-witness-to-steer-clear-of-evidence-about-alleged-killing

We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. It’s funny who you bump into on a stroll along the north Kent coast. At the start there’s pioneering aviator Amy Johnson, while lurking near the end is Hammer horror and Star Wars actor Peter Cushing. In between, there’s detective inspector Edmund Reid, who not only failed to detect Jack the Ripper but also that the town he chose to retire to would be washed away. All three add more history to a walk along this stretch of the 163-mile Saxon Shore Way that runs from Gravesend to Hastings. The volunteers who created the trail in 1980 wanted it to follow the shoreline as it did in the third century AD, when the Romans were being plagued by Saxon pirates. The path is waymarked with a warrior helmet logo. None of the famous people mentioned are still with us, so I enlist the support of my friend Adam as a walking buddy to prevent me from talking to ghosts. Our easy route – mostly along a flat, concrete pathway with the Thames estuary and beach to our right – features abundant birdlife. Adam knows what’s what on the shingle shore and intertidal mudflats, spotting ringed plover, redshank and turnstones. The bronze statue of Amy Johnson is a few hundred metres into a walk that begins at Herne Bay’s clocktower, built in 1837, the first year of Queen Victoria’s reign. In 1930, Johnson was the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia, and the statue shows her in flying gear, hand to head, ready to pull down her goggles. Her gaze passes the town’s 1920s bandstand and out to the estuary where her plane crashed in bad weather on 5 January 1941. Her body was never found. Also out to sea is the dilapidated and eerie-looking pier head, a remnant of a time when Herne Bay’s pier was the second longest in England and paddle steamers were able to moor alongside it. Storms have left it isolated, distant from the stub of pier that remains, with its beach-hut-style stalls and a helter skelter. The sun is on us, though any warmth is whipped away by a blustery breeze that underlines the pier head’s vulnerability. The sea and gales have previously wreaked havoc on the place we arrive at next: Hampton-on-Sea. The idea of Hampton was catnip to Victorian businessmen, who from the 1860s thought it represented a real catch for the oyster industry and would make an impressive seaside resort. Sadly, the combination of an 1866-built oyster pier, poorly conceived sea defences and a culvert of Hampton Brook prone to flooding caused erosion that meant by the early 1920s the “town” was drowned. We pass what remains: the Hampton Inn and a short stone pier. I read an information board as Adam watches a starling murmuration above Long Rock to the west. The last resident to leave Hampton was Edmund Reid, in 1916. Once head of the CID, Reid spent his retirement highlighting the plight of the town and its people as both ebbed. As we walk to Long Rock, a site of special scientific interest, Adam points out turnstones on the shore flipping pebbles with their beaks, and sanderlings lined up just out of reach of the waves. By a patch of inland water is an egret, its white plumage contrasting with the blue water and the grassland around it. The rare hog’s fennel grows here and supports the equally rare fisher’s estuarine moth. The quiet is interrupted only by bird cries and the tumble of waves that are far enough out to reveal The Street, a shingle spit at Tankerton that can be walked – with caution – at low tide. A kestrel hovers above, but is soon gone. Fishing boats bobbing against their moorings signal we are approaching Whitstable, its harbour front busy with people buying seafood and browsing art and craft stalls. What I love about this walk is how it evolves from a traditional (Victorian) portrait of the seaside into a contemporary coastal scene. In Whitstable, our path brims with oyster shacks, cafe-restaurants, artists’ studios and wooden houses by the shore, many of them holiday homes. These houses have wonderful estuary views. One, at Sea Wall, belonged to Peter Cushing. The actor was so fond of a particular vista – he would paint here – that it has been named Cushing’s View. A bench and plaque mark the spot, though it doesn’t mean the conclusion of our walk. We continue through Whitstable, passing Old Neptune, a popular pub on the shore, and head for West Beach, its shingle dotted with battered and derelict boats. The end comes with our elevation – the only hill we encounter. It is well worth the short, sharp incline to discover the Rose in Bloom pub on Joy Lane. Sitting on its terrace – awaiting lunch, with a view of the Isle of Sheppey, the estuary in wide angle and, in the distance, Southend – I think how fish and chips remains a unifying part of coastal life. No matter how the seaside evolves, nor how much nature shapes and changes it, this dish is the one tying past and present together. The Rose in Bloom’s Shepherd Neame ales, including Master Brew and the Whitstable Bay collection, come from a brewery in nearby Faversham. The menu offers locally caught seafood (mussels in cream and garlic with fries, £14.50; cod and chips, £14; sea bass with fries and salad, £14), and the interior is elegant, with a conservatory. Yet the main attraction of the Rose in Bloom is its outdoor terrace (covered in winter). High above the shore, eating and drinking here is elevated by a sublime vista over treetops and a tangle of undergrowth and across the Thames and Swale estuaries to Essex. The Space at 8 is a stylish, two double-bed apartment on a terraced row no more than a couple of minutes’ walk from Whitstable’s high street, with its cafes, bars and shops, and less than five minutes from the beach. It used to be a fisherman’s cottage, but renovation in 2018 has turned it into an art-laden design haven. There’s a gorgeous tiled bathroom, large kitchen and dining area, and – the clincher – bifold doors that open on to a south-facing garden, with a furnished patio that feels quiet and private, despite being so close to everything.Sleeps four from £120 a night",Lifestyle/Travel,"A great walk to a great pub – Rose in Bloom, Whitstable, Kent",https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/25/a-great-walk-to-a-great-pub-rose-in-bloom-whitstable-kent
2/25/2022,"Emergency room visits for eating disorders among 12- to 17-year-old girls doubled during the coronavirus pandemic, according to new research from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – a troubling existing trend that was likely worsened by the stress of living through the prolonged crisis. “​​We are seeing such a high volume of patients in need of eating disorder care as well as worsening severity,” said Tracy Richmond, a physician and the director of the eating disorder program at Boston Children’s Hospital, who was not involved in the CDC study. “It feels really clear for those of us who take care of teenagers that there is an absolute second pandemic of mental health needs in adolescents.”  After a decade of increasing concern, the American Academy of Pediatrics declared a national mental health emergency among children and teens in 2021, and the US surgeon general warned in December of a youth mental health crisis that began building before the pandemic. In 2020, kids actually made fewer visits to emergency departments than the year before – a decline of 21%, the CDC report found. In 2021, there was a decrease of 8% compared to 2019. But the reason for those visits changed dramatically during the early months of the pandemic, with the proportion of emergency visits for mental health among kids rising by 24% in 5- to 11-year-olds and 31% in 12- to 17-year-old, as compared with the year before. There are also marked differences in gender. Among teen girls, aged 12 to 17, visits for eating disorders and tic disorders increased in both 2020 and 2021. There were also more visits for depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder among teen girls in 2021. Another CDC study published the same day found that overall visits to the emergency room declined in this same time, falling by 51% in 2020, 22% in 2021, and 23% in the first month of 2022, compared to 2019. Covid-19 remained the predominant reason for ER visits among kids – particularly among children too young to be vaccinated during the Omicron wave, when visits for that age group increased. There were also increases in visits related to behavioral health conditions among children five to 17, including self-harm, drug poisonings, socioeconomic and psychosocial concerns, and – among adolescents only – symptoms of mental health conditions and substance use. “The results point to the importance of increased awareness for health concerns that could arise due to delayed medical care and heightened emotional distress during the pandemic, especially among adolescents,” said Lakshmi Radhakrishnan, a health scientist at the CDC and the lead author of both studies. The reasons for the rise in distress among teen girls are complex and various, she added, making it difficult to pinpoint their cause. Richmond said that inpatient visits at her center have nearly tripled and the need for outpatient care has also increased. “As patients are coming in with higher needs, they’re coming in with more severe presentation, and they’re often coming in with comorbid mental illness, like depression, anxiety, suicidality,” Richmond said. Potential reasons include changes in routine and schedule, including spending more time at home and new habits around eating and exercise, as well as the stress of living through the pandemic – losing parents and caregivers to the virus or to other related causes, watching parents worry about their jobs and their own mental health. Social isolation can be particularly challenging in the teenage years, when it’s important for kids to form close relationships with peers and build their own identities. “They’re meant to be individuating from parents and family, and really be striking out on their own and developing their own individuality,” Richmond said. “Instead, in the early parts of the pandemic, they were driven back into the home and closer to their families.” Kids have also had disruptions to their regular activities and extracurricular interests – sports teams, theater groups, newspapers. The isolation may have accelerated an existing tendency to spend time on social media, where they are flooded with increasingly precise algorithms that may lead to the rapid rise in eating disorders. “As our adolescents have been spending more time with social media, we also are uncovering that the content that they’re being served is just getting more and more extreme,” Richmond said. The tic disorders seen were particularly unusual because boys of the same age didn’t see an increase – and tic disorders tend to be diagnosed at earlier ages and are more common in boys than in girls. The increase in tic disorders may also be linked to social media – specifically TikTok, where cataloging tics has become its own genre of videos. But social media can also provide support and socialization, as well as a creative outlet, for many kids – and nuanced discussions of the role of social media are very important, said Tyler Black, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and suicidologist at BC Children’s Hospital in Vancouver. “Kids were online and connecting virtually and Snapchatting before we were Zooming – they were doing virtual teleconferences before we even knew what Zoom was – and they were very prepared for online interaction.” The return to school, for those who attended remotely or on a hybrid schedule, may have also contributed to stress, Black said. School is a major cause of stress for kids with anxiety, according to a 2014 study from the American Psychological Association. Kids are about twice as likely to die of suicide in the United States on school days versus non-school days. “People naively say things like ‘if we send kids back to school, we’ll restore their mental health.’ And I keep wanting to remind everybody that prior to the pandemic, we had a lot of concerns about school and kids’ mental health,” Black said, including bullying, racism and a lack of mental health curriculum or support services for kids. Eating disorders can affect everyone, Richmond said – “all genders, all ages, all socioeconomic groups, all racial and ethnic groups – and I do think we’ve seen more of that during the pandemic than ever before.” Every wave of Covid-19 has also brought destabilization, she said. “There’s just continued uncertainty, and a feeling of loss – you sort of feel like you’re getting your footing under you, and then a new variant comes and shakes everything up,” Richmond said. “I do think there’s some sense of kids wanting to control things … and for many of them, it just spirals out of control in a way that they didn’t expect.”",News/World news,"Eating disorders among teen girls doubled during pandemic, CDC study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/eating-disorders-teen-girls-doubled-pandemic-cdc
2/25/2022,"Demand for nature is exceeding supply but new wildlife areas can be created by regulations to ensure housing estates bring about “biodiversity net gain”, according to the chair of England’s nature watchdog. Tony Juniper said the post-pandemic surge in people visiting wild places for their mental and physical wellbeing – and to walk lockdown puppies – was concentrating footfall in relatively few nature reserves, which were increasingly used like public parks.  But Juniper, who has been reappointed as chair of Natural England for a second three-year term, said his agency must “increase the supply of nature”. “Part of the challenge post-lockdown – the footfall in relatively few sites – makes you wonder how we’re going to cope with that increased demand for nature when nature is depleted and fragmented,” he said. “Visitor pressures on protected sites [such as national nature reserves] is a supply and demand question.” Juniper, a former executive director of Friends of the Earth, has been credited with restoring morale – and adding a 47% budget increase this year – to beleaguered Natural England, which had been decimated by a decade of cuts. But after three years “building the picture and getting the toolkit and resources to deliver it” he said it was time for him and Natural England to deliver on “the gargantuan task of nature recovery” to help the government meet its ambitious wildlife targets. The government’s target to protect 30% of land and sea for nature by 2030 was “a big stretch”, he said. “We have targets coming on species abundance and nature recovery, and if we are going to get to those 2030 targets we need to start really hitting the ground now.” The new “public money for public goods” farm subsidy system, although not fully finalised, should help, according to Juniper, who said he was also hopeful that wildlife could be restored via biodiversity net gain, which from 2023 obliges every housing and infrastructural development to create 10% more nature than was there before. One-fifth of Tory party donations come from major developers but Juniper said biodiversity net gain was not “just a licence to trash” wildlife. “It isn’t, because we’re not abandoning anything we already have in terms of the existing protections and tests [for wildlife] that need to go through the planning system,” he said. He admitted there were “tensions” between developers providing nature-friendly spaces close to new homes or boosting wildlife in distant sites. “On the one hand we want more bigger, better, more connected nature-rich places, on the other we want to improve the environments around where people are living,” he said. Speaking during a tour of 25 acres of arable farmland acquired for restoration to wildlife-rich chalk grassland by the charity Cambridge Past, Present and Future, Juniper said it was important to plan a network of new nature-rich places close to new homes. The restoration will increase Wandlebury country park by 20% but Cambridge’s population has grown by 20% this century, with an ongoing jobs, development and population boom. “There’s limited semi-natural habitat around here so creating more of it to be able to serve that population makes sense,” said Juniper. “But doing it in the best possible way to get the biggest strategic impact is the key thing. We don’t want little pocket parks scattered all over the place randomly. We’d like to see the coherent construction of a nature recovery network which is not only taking account of biodiversity net gain but also the existing protected areas and blend that with the new agricultural schemes. It’s a jigsaw to piece together.” While Juniper has helped win an enhanced role and funding for Natural England, and said he was hopeful of “further increases this year because the work is expanding”, Natural England staff went on strike in January over a decade of pay freezes and below-inflation rises. Juniper said Natural England’s executive was doing all it could to push for more money for staff. “We’re very aware of the issues being raised by staff around pay. Since I’ve been there we’ve consistently done the maximum we could each year in terms of staff rewards and pay but the big picture is constraint – we have the rules set by the Treasury.” In his next three years, Juniper said he hoped to create more big national nature reserves and said the issue of out-of-control dogs in wild spaces was raised wherever he went. He said it was still possible to make more space for wildlife and for people. “Everyone at Natural England is convinced it’s not nature recovery or public access – it’s both. With some limits during the bird breeding season, raising awareness and management, I think we can do that.”",News/Environment,Natural England chair backs ‘biodiversity net gain’ plan to boost wild areas,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/25/natural-england-chair-tony-juniper-backs-biodiversity-net-gain-plan-boost-wild-areas
2/25/2022,"There are countless talking points in the new oral history of Mad Max: Fury Road. As well as Tom Hardy v Charlize Theron, we hear accounts of everything from the writing process to stunts, on-set challenges and the battle faced by the softly spoken Australian auteur George Miller to get Warner Bros to release his film in an untampered state. “Talking points” is a salient phrase. The format of Kyle Buchanan’s book, Blood, Sweat & Chrome: The Wild and True Story of Mad Max: Fury Road, reduces the journalist’s voice to let subjects speak for themselves. This approach has obvious appeal for talent, whose views aren’t diluted by the writer’s. This is presumably a key reason the book is an authorised version of events, meaning it was made with the participation of Miller and the collaboration of his production company Kennedy Miller Mitchell.  I also wrote a book on Mad Max (Miller and Max: George Miller and the Making of a Film Legend), which covers all four movies to date as well as the story of Miller himself – charting the former medical doctor’s journey from the small town of Chinchilla, Queensland to the highest echelons of Hollywood. My book was fun to write, but far from easy; I wasn’t surprised to learn that support groups exist for writers of unauthorised biographies. I interviewed 79 people, speaking to an array of colourful characters – many of them battered-looking men with whom I shared meals, long chats, beers, coffee and on one occasion “choof tea” (a marijuana infusion). I also spoke with Miller’s childhood friends and engaged extensively with the family of Byron Kennedy, the co-creator of Mad Max and producer of the first two films who died in a helicopter accident in 1983. I didn’t, however, get to chat to Theron, Hardy or other super-famous talent – including Miller himself, who declined to be interviewed. When my book finally arrived on the shelves, I expressed my gratitude to Miller for his work, describing him in the introduction as “the most influential Australian artist of the 20th century” as well as a man who seems to me “humble” and “down to earth”. Yet I would estimate that, conservatively speaking, about 25 people (most of them involved with Fury Road) either pulled out of interviews with me or never agreed – because my project didn’t have the director’s blessing. Writing an unauthorised book turned ever more tricky. In the end, no images from any Mad Max movie – or even the words “Mad Max” – could be used on the cover. So it was interesting to read an account that came with the blessing of Miller and co, one revealing some things I couldn’t – including various details about Miller’s combative relationship with the studio, and the friction between Theron and Hardy. But that logic swings both ways; there are merits in both authorised and unauthorised accounts. Reading Blood, Sweat & Chrome made me reminisce on some of the more … colourful elements in Miller and Max that might never have made it into an authorised book but were published in mine. For example, during the making of Mad Max 2, the crew were having difficulty locating the three-legged dog stipulated in the script. According to multiple interviewees, Miller suggested they find a four-legged one and amputate its leg. “We were all gobsmacked,” one person in attendance told me. “I think, I hope, it was a joke,” said another. My book recounts various debaucheries such as how, during pre-production of Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, some crew members (unbeknown to Miller) drove its spectacularly freaky skeletal vehicles around backstreets in Sydney while – in the words of the production designer Grace Walker, who was one of them – “pissed as tits”. Real dog skulls were used to decorate the film set, prepared by the set dresser and decorator Martin O’Neill, who recounted to me in gory detail how he picked up dead dogs from the pound then boiled them. Late one weekend evening, O’Neill arrived on the set of Bartertown with a pump-action shotgun, intending to create a more lived-in looking environment (in his words, to “distress the set a bit”). He also recounted that evening to me in detail: “I just went mental in there,” he said. “I’m going CHI-CHI BOOM! CHI-CHI BOOM! CHI-CHI-BOOM! in every direction.” My book also details some pretty disgusting ideas and imagery used in the writing and brainstorming process for Fury Road, arguably in contrast to the film’s eventual interpretation as a powerful feminist statement. It contains plenty of other stories, which, I believe, offer light and dark, colour and shade, and more than a whiff of petrol-scented lunacy to the narrative of these extraordinary artistic achievements. Buchanan’s book is attracting considerable publicity. But for me, its crowning achievement is its detailed illustration of how difficult the film-making process was. Fury Road fans should definitely check it out. You won’t find the full story in the authorised account – though you won’t find it in the unauthorised one either. As ever, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.",Arts/Film,"Dog skulls, choof tea and amputation: here’s what the new Mad Max book doesn’t tell you",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/25/dog-skulls-choof-tea-and-amputation-heres-what-the-new-mad-max-book-doesnt-tell-you
2/25/2022," On the back of her health technology company (the fittingly villainous-sounding Theranos) Elizabeth Holmes became America’s youngest self-made female billionaire. But her so-called innovations were a dangerous scam, and Holmes now faces prison. This tale feels increasingly emblematic of modern American life: Holmes seemed to embody progress, prosperity and innovation, but her business was built on sand and her story culminated in deception and humiliation. Starring Amanda Seyfried as a smart, brittle and terrifyingly ambitious Holmes, this drama feels like a nuanced and at times even sympathetic rendering of a grim late-capitalist fable.Disney+, from Thursday 3 March Oddly, given that it’s presented as an espionage thriller, plot isn’t really the big point of Killing Eve. It’s more about the electrifying chemistry between Eve (Sandra Oh) and Villanelle (Jodie Comer) – and the success of this final season hinges on a satisfying resolution of their relationship. Eve is now in private security – albeit with a sideline suggesting her interest in the Twelve hasn’t abated – and Villanelle has, comically, found herself in a religious community. The show has drifted since its startling first season, but there’s still enough class and charisma to hope for a good send-off.BBC iPlayer, from Monday 28 February Ninjas! Laser attacks! Demonic squid! This hyperactive and berserk new animation series from Castlevania’s Adi Shankar is equal parts superhero narrative and love letter to 90s US pop culture. Featuring whatever format might appeal at any given moment – styles include stop-motion, claymation, pixel art and many more – Shankar tells the story of an alien superhero called Marvelous Man, who has maintained peace on Earth for several decades, before a grim secret throws the world into chaos and all-out war looms.Netflix, from Tuesday 1 March There’s rags-to-riches/riches-to-rags street dance action in this never knowingly understated Spanish-language drama. Starring Paulina Dávila and Greeicy Rendón, it is set in the contrasting worlds of two Colombian dancers, both looking to get ahead in a dangerously competitive world and both with personal demons. It’s ripe, frequently melodramatic fare but the themes – ambition, temptation, class – are universal and there are lashings of sex, infectious music and improbable dance moves galore.Netflix, from Wednesday 2 March Are you ready for Tiger King: The Drama? Some people might argue that, given we already have two documentary series’ worth of this story, Joe vs Carole is superfluous. They might also contend that Tiger King was inextricably linked to a moment in time – visceral escapism during the disorientation of early lockdown. But Exotic v Baskin isn’t a thread TV-makers show any signs of wanting to stop pulling. For the purposes of this overheated melodrama, Kate McKinnon plays Carole and John Cameron Mitchell is Joe.Peacock on Sky/Now, from Thursday 3 March Another superhero universe spreads its wings: DC comic adaptation The Boys gets an animated spin-off. This eight-part series is in the tradition of The Animatrix – a short series set in the universe of The Matrix but not directly connected to its narrative. Instead, these stories stand alone – and there are some big-name creators involved, with writing from Seth Rogen, Awkwafina, Eliot and Ilana Glazer and Andy Samberg. Expect a range of styles – from Looney Tunes homage to graphic novel-esque heroics – and an engaging sense of fun.Amazon Prime Video, from Friday March 4 How well do you actually know the people you love? This enigmatic drama, based on Karin Slaughter’s 2018 novel, stars Toni Collette as Laura Oliver, a middle-aged woman who might not have told her daughter Andy (Bella Heathcote) quite everything about her life. The catalyst is a potential shooting spree in a cafe that is slickly terminated by Laura. But where did she learn those ninja skills? And why has the incident prompted her to insist Andy move out of the house they share? An intriguing tale that surrenders its secrets carefully and gradually.Netflix, from Friday 4 March ",Arts/Television & radio,The Dropout to Killing Eve: the seven best shows to stream this week,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/25/the-dropout-to-killing-eve-the-seven-best-shows-to-stream-this-week
2/25/2022,"The Dominican Republic has begun work on a border wall with Haiti, sparking controversy between the neighbouring Caribbean countries. Construction began this week on a concrete barrier that will span nearly half of the 244-mile (392km) border between the two countries, with Dominican officials claiming it will reduce flows of migrants, drugs, weapons and contraband.  “The benefit for both nations will be of great importance,” said the Dominican president, Luis Abinader, in a statement given at a ground-breaking ceremony in the Dominican border town of Dajabón, adding that the first phase of the project should be completed within nine months. While the two countries that make up the island of Hispaniola are close geographically, their differences are stark. The Dominican Republic, with a population of 10.8 million, is a booming tourist destination with year-round visitors to its resorts and golf courses. Haiti, with a population of 11.4 million, is the western hemisphere’s poorest country, wracked with crime and mired in political and economic crisis. “Each time Haiti has suffered a catastrophe, the Dominicans have always been the first to arrive with help,” Abinader said. “However, the Dominican Republic cannot take charge of the political and economic crisis in that country.” Haiti has been beset by overlapping crises. The country’s president, Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated in early July last year in circumstances that remain unclear. A 7.2-magnitude earthquake wrecked the country’s rural south in August. About 500,000 Haitians live in the Dominican Republic, according to a 2018 survey. Many of them work in the construction, agriculture and tourism industries for low pay. There are concerns the wall will bring opportunities for bribery. Santiago Riverón, the mayor of Dajabon, where construction began, claimed that soldiers have profited from illegal border crossings. “Now we have to work with the wall in the minds of the military, who are the ones who take advantage of the border and receive a bribe of 100 or 200 pesos [£1.30 or £2.60] to let people cross,” the mayor told AFP on Sunday. “The relationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti has always been difficult due to their different speeds and rhythms,” said Fiammetta Cappellini, the Haiti representative for Italian charity AVSI. “However, the decision to build a wall worries us, as a possible reason for conflict and violence.” Made of 20cm-thick concrete and 3.9 metres (12.8ft) high, topped with a metal mesh fence, there will be 70 watchtowers built along the wall, which will have fibre optics for communications, movement sensors, cameras, radars and drones. No cost has been given for the project and observers say that the wall will do little to stem migration flows. “AVSI, along with much of civil society in both Haiti and the Dominican Republic, pledge to strengthen dialogue and to invest in more inclusive development,” said Cappellini, to reduce migration. “Instead of building walls.”",News/Global development,Dominican Republic starts work on border wall with Haiti,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/25/dominican-republic-starts-work-on-border-wall-with-haiti
2/25/2022,"Morning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories this morning.  Ukraine is fighting for its survival today as the Russian offensive against its neighbour continues to escalate. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, confirmed reports of missile strikes on military and civilian targets this morning, while multiple explosions were heard in Kyiv and air-raid sirens sounded across the city. The key Hostomel air base just outside Kyiv is controlled by Ukrainian forces again, but there is heavy fighting going on north-west of the capital. The deputy defence minister has just said that Russian troops will soon be “just outside Kyiv”, but British military experts said Ukrainian forces had provided “fierce resistance across all axes of Russia’s advance”. In a grave address to the nation earlier on Friday, Zelenskiy said 137 Ukrainians have died so far and although he said he was “target number one” of the Russian military, he would stay in Kyiv. Here’s what we know so far about the invasion, and you can also follow developments at our live blog and read our visual guide to what’s happening. Zelenskiy lamented the lack of on-the-ground military support, with the west’s response only to impose more sanctions. Some EU states are reluctant to go so far as to cripple Russia’s economy by excluding it from the Swift system of dollar payments, so the bloc may not endorse the plan, bringing fury from Ukraine. Boris Johnson has promised tough action as well. In Russia, police arrested more than 1,700 people after protests against the invasion in 53 cities. The question of why Putin has pursued such a reckless path is being asked by governments all over the world, and bewilderment about the Russian leader’s “despotic mindset” has been amplified by his bizarre justifications about “denazifying” Ukraine. Our team of correspondents take us through the tense buildup and then the unleashing of Russia’s military might on the first day of the invasion, which also included a carefully chosen list of targets and “data-wiper” cyberattacks. Ukraine has now called on hackers to help defend against more cyber warfare. Our columnist Timothy Garton Ash, an expert on eastern Europe, writes that the invasion will change the continent for ever, while a Ukrainian journalist in Kyiv shares her disbelief that the attack went ahead. And Oliver Bullough argues that Johnson’s claims that Britain is rooting out Russian money are wide of the mark. Student inequality – Plans to reform student finance in England will result in wealthy undergraduates being better off, while women, disadvantaged students and those from the north and Midlands are most likely to be worse off, according to the government’s own equality analysis. Under the proposals, students who enrol in 2023-24 would make loan repayments for 40 years rather than 30. It means that graduates who end up earning more over their careers would see their lifetime repayments fall, while those making less would see theirs increase by 150%. Blocking move – Social media users could be cut off from other accounts on platforms such as Twitter if they do not sign up for ID verification, under proposals to tackle anonymous trolls. Sites including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram will be required to give users the option to opt in or opt out from receiving messages, replies and content from unverified or anonymous accounts. Verified users could also block unverified or anonymous accounts from seeing their content under the opt in/opt out proposals. Rape failings – Rape survivors who report their attackers are being systematically failed by the criminal justice system, resulting in an average wait of nearly two years before a trial begins, a damning official report has found. A joint inspection by police and crown prosecution watchdogs has identified multiple failings in the process from reporting a rape to a possible trial and conviction of an assailant. A lack of collaboration between police and prosecutors has led to months of delays and poor communication with accusers. Long way round – Theft of London hire bikes, dubbed “Boris bikes” after their introduction by the then London mayor, has been increasing. But the end destination of the stolen bikes has thrown up surprises with the list including Australia, Gambia, Turkey and Jamaica, a freedom of information request has revealed. Our correspondents join Michael Safi to discuss the Russian invasion of Ukraine and fears it could escalate into the most serious conflict Europe has seen since the second world war.

He discusses overacting, bad accents – and being cast as a charmer by his wife, Maggie Gyllenhaal. The four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel has issued a strident call for Formula One to abandon this season’s scheduled race in Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. This season’s Champions League final will be moved from St Petersburg, but pressure remains on football to respond even more strongly as the crisis in Ukraine escalates. On the field, a wild night at Ibrox featuring two goals for James Tavernier and a bizarrely ruled-out effort by Ryan Kent ended in a 2-2 draw as Rangers dumped favourites Borussia Dortmund out of the Europa League 6-4 on aggregate. Mikel Arteta said Alexandre Lacazette “behaves like someone who wants to stay with us” after the striker made a vital contribution to Arsenal’s dramatic late Premier League victory over Wolves. After Sarina Wiegman’s England team won the Arnold Clark Cup, our writers address key questions in the buildup to July’s Women’s Euros. Novak Djokovic’s run of two consecutive years as the undisputed tennis No 1 has come to an end after he suffered a shock defeat to Jiri Vesely in their Dubai quarter-final. Russia’s Daniil Medvedev is set to overtake the Serb on Monday. Leeds will have to defy history if they are to win the Super League title after labouring their way to a third successive defeat – a 10-4 loss to Catalans Dragons – to start the new season. England have been dealt a colossal blow before Saturday’s crunch Six Nations match against Wales with Manu Tuilagi ruled out by a hamstring injury – just hours after he was recalled to the side by Eddie Jones. Greg Norman, who is fronting a Saudi Arabia-backed breakaway golf league, has warned the head of the PGA Tour “it certainly is not the end” despite a string of high-profile players shunning the scheme. Financial markets are still absorbing the blow from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with commodities prices soaring amid the uncertainty. Brent crude oil, which yesterday went above $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, was on the rise again on Friday with a 2% lift to $101.20. The FTSE lost nearly 4% yesterday but looks set to recover at least 1% of that this morning. The pound is on $1.343 and €1.197. The Guardian’s front page has the stark headline “Putin invades” and carries a picture of a wounded civilian woman that features on many fronts. “Her blood … his hands” says the Mirror, while the Sun goes with “Her blood on his hands”. The Mail reports “Putin to seize capital in days”, the FT has “Putin’s forces storm Ukraine” and the Telegraph says “New cold war as Putin strikes”. The Express splash head is “Redrawing map of Europe in blood”, Metro says “War in Europe”, as does the Press and Journal in Scotland. The i has “Ukraine’s agony” and the Northern Echo says “Our worst fears have come true”. See more front pages from around the world at our papers wrap here.
