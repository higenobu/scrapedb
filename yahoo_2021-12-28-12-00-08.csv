12/28/2021,"Video from the deadly Los Angeles police shooting that killed an assault suspect and a 14-year-old bystander at a Burlington store on Thursday shows the suspect beating a woman with a bike lock before a group of officers finds him and one opens fire with a rifle. ""She's bleeding! She's bleeding!"" the officer screams of the victim as she crawls out of an aisle of home goods.  ""Hold up! Hold up!"" screams another officer, just before the first fires three rounds at the suspect, who is standing at the opposite end of the aisle. Daniel Elena-Lopez, 24, crumples to the ground, where he would later be pronounced dead. Elena-Lopez appeared to be moving away from the victim and the officer at the time of the shooting. Almost immediately, another woman's screams can be heard coming from an adjacent changing area — where 14-year-old Valentina Orellana-Peralta had been trying on dresses with her mother. Valentina had also been struck by one of the officer's rounds, after it bounced off the ground and went through a wall separating the changing area from the shopping floor, police said. The video — a combination of 911 calls, store surveillance footage and officers' body-camera video — was released by LAPD on Monday as part of an effort to be transparent about the tragic case, which sparked outrage and condemnation from some of the officers' tactics.  It provides the clearest picture to date of an incident that has attracted international attention, including in Valentina's native Chile, where an aunt said the family is devastated. Carolina Peralta said Valentina had been a shy girl in Chile, but that ""everything was turning out well for her in the U.S.,"" where she had reconnected with family, including her beloved older sister, was becoming ""more outgoing."" ""Valentina died in the arms of her mother, inside the dressing room,"" her aunt said. ""My sister does not understand how this tragedy could have happened just when they had managed to reunite the family."" The shooting has drawn widespread condemnation and renewed questions about police tactics in confronting armed individuals in the community. Some say police must be able to confront and stop criminals from attacking innocent victims, while others question officers' reflexive reliance on their own weapons to do so — even when the suspects don't have firearms. Either way, the video lays bare a raw and sadly-rational fear of casual shoppers and well-trained police officers across America, which is that, at any moment, a retail store — like a school, a church or any other space — can suddenly become the target of a bloody attack. Elena Lopez had no gun, but the fear that he did — as articulated in some of the 911 calls — helped shape the police response and, ultimately, the tragic outcome. The department still had not released the name of the officer who fired as of Monday. This story will be updated.

12/28/2021,"The cryptocurrency created back in 2013 as a joke by Billy Marcus and Jackson Palmer now is the 12th biggest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $25 billion dollars. On December 27th, Billy Marcus said on his official twitter account that he holds approximately 220,000 DOGE and that he is not working on the Dogecoin project, but he is a regular member of the DOGE community. He also said that he isn’t going back to be part of the project because the more he dedicated to the project, the community treated him worse. Marcus also commented that he doesn’t owe anything to the crypto community, and he is free to talk about anything he wants.He also supports the people that are working to improve the crypto space and is disappointed in the ones that aren’t making it better. This is not the first time that Billy Marcus talks about Dogecoin (DOGE) this year. Last January he tweeted that he left the project 7 years ago because of harassment of the community. “I’m no longer part of the Dogecoin project. I left around 2015, as the community started to strongly shift from one that I was comfortable with. I don’t currently own any Dogecoin, except what has been tipped to me recently, I gave away and/or sold all the crypto I had back in 2015, after being laid off and scared about my dwindling savings at the time, for about enough in total to buy a used Honda Civic.” Billy Marcus said on Reddit. Six months later, in June, he tweeted that he bought some DOGE after he promised 8 years ago that he would never buy crypto again. It has been a good year for DOGE and crypto in general. Although DOGE is at $0.19 at the time of writing, it is actually down 72% from it’s all time high ($0.68) in May. However, it is still up +4,000% in comparison with its price from a year ago. Elon Musk took a huge influencer role on its price movement during this year, especially when he appeared on Saturday Night Live talking about Dogecoin, which was the same time that the cryptocurrency had its ATH. Last October, AMC Theatres announced that they will be accepting DOGE to buy digital gift cards, and recently this month, Elon Musk announced that DOGE will be accepted in Tesla as a form of payment for some merchandise. It appears that DOGE is no longer a joke and it is used to buy real things, Billy Marcus 8 years ago wouldn’t have imagined that DOGE would have come this far. The co-founder has made it very clear that he doesn’t want to be a part of the project again, and as the global crypto adoption continues, we can expect DOGE to continue to grow next year.
