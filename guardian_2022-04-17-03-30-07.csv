4/17/2022,"Holidaymakers savoured the sunshine at the country’s beaches and parks on Saturday in the first Easter break without lockdown restrictions for two years. Many headed for the coast, with most of the country enjoying the temperatures that reached 21.6C on Saturday, according to the Met Office. It was the hottest day of the year so far on Good Friday, when highs of 23.4C were recorded at St James’s Park in London – warmer than Ibiza. The seven miles of beaches at Bournemouth attracted some of the biggest crowds of the year. Coastal car parks in Cornwall were also packed as holidaymakers headed to the beaches and pubs. The Easter getaway has been disrupted by staff shortages at the country’s airports and rail shutdowns on part of the network. Liverpool and Man City fans travelling to the FA Cup match at Wembley were advised to avoid travelling by rail because of the closure of Euston Station in London for track improvements. Drivers were hit with long delays on some routes. In Berkshire, a stretch of the M4 was closed in both directions between junctions 13 and 14 after fire crews were called to a fire and explosions at an industrial unit near the RAF Welford base. A vast plume of smoke could be seen from the motorway. Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire involved “possible pyrotechnics and fireworks”. There were no reported injuries. In the south-east, motorists faced gridlock after a crash in Surrey and a police incident at the Dartford Crossing brought traffic to a halt, with six-mile tailbacks reported on the M25 on Saturday afternoon. Motorists also faced delays near Bristol and Birmingham, although traffic yesterday was not believed to be as heavy as on Good Friday, according to the AA, which estimates that about 27.6m journeys will be made in total over the “busier than usual” bank holiday weekend. The RAC suggested the best time to travel on major roads on Sunday is after 3pm, and then either before 10.30am on Easter Mondaytomorrow or after 6.30pm to avoid major queues. There have also been some reports of fuel shortages, with the Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent forecourts, saying it was aware of protests at several supply sites. Meanwhile, after weeks of delays and baggage fiascos at UK airports, there was some good news from Heathrow and Manchester. One man flying from Heathrow wrote online that it had taken him only three hours to get from Wakefield to the airport and through security. Another wrote: “Despite all the headlines, Heathrow airport has been a breeze with check in and security. And now we’ve got over two hours to kill.” And in Manchester, a passenger wrote that there was “no queue for taxi drop-off – none to check in – security queue very small – in and through to airside in 15 mins”. At the Port of Dover, traffic was also said to be flowing smoothly again after days of delays caused by the suspension of ferry crossings to and from Calais by P&O Ferries. The Met Office said temperatures on Saturday yesterday were above average for mid-April, with the highest temperature of 21.6C recorded at Chivenor, near Barnstaple in Devon. Dan Stroud, from the Met Office, said it had been a “glorious day in the south and the south east” in particular, with some cloud in other areas. Most southern and eastern areas are forecast to stay dry for the rest of the bank holiday weekend with sunshine, but there will be more unsettled weather in the north and north-west.",News/UK news,Sunshine and packed beaches mark first Easter since lockdown,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/16/sunshine-and-packed-beaches-mark-first-easter-since-lockdown
4/17/2022,"For Grantly Dick-Read, the Victorian originator of the UK’s natural childbirth movement, birthing women in Britain should emulate those, as he phrased it, “of more primitive types”. In Natural Childbirth, 1933, he pictured one of these individuals disappearing into a “thicket” – it sounded plausible enough from Woking – to await her pain-free labour. “Natural birth is all that she looks for; there are no fears in her mind; no midwives spoiling the natural process; she has no knowledge of the tragedies of sepsis, infection and haemorrhage.” The “modern cultured girl” had, he theorised, lost the knack of childbirth. But she might regain it if she delivered according to his own system, excluding “meddlesome” medical intervention. Even as Dick-Read, an adroit self-publicist, managed to promulgate his fantasy, there were contemporaries who disputed all of it, noting his lack of evidence. “Meddling”, it was pointed out, had saved countless lives, maternal and infant. Another doctor asked, in 1955: “Does childbearing require special training to be natural?” As for women, the unenlightened were still clamouring for pain relief, like the Queen got for Prince Charles. But Read’s thicket could still sound, as it has continued so advantageously to do, a lot nicer than submission in a scary or unkind hospital. In 1956, it inspired Prunella Briance, a survivor of traumatic deliveries, to create the Natural Childbirth Association, teaching Dick-Reid methods. Renamed the National Childbirth Trust, or NCT, this organisation remained true to its creators’ vision to a point that has inevitably, given the frequent refusal of female biology to comply with thicket-worthy deliveries, attracted attention. It has been reported, for instance, that days before Donna Ockenden’s final report about avoidable deaths at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust detailed its sometimes lethal unwillingness to perform caesareans, the NCT website still featured material telling mothers that “natural” labour would leave them more “satisfied”. In fact, Ockenden had deplored the NHS trust’s culture of “normal birth at almost any cost” in 2020, in her interim findings. Hundreds of women had told her they “felt pressure to have a natural birth”. Responding to Ockenden’s final review, the NCT said it had changed since 1956: “We are not here to promote one way over another.” However, recent alumni report continued exaltation of “natural” birth by some instructors and a parallel aversion to the “cascade of interventions” said to await the unwary. Some have been advised to memorise the acronym Brain, to avoid being diverted from planned transcendence by the descendants of Dick-Read’s “meddlers”. As in: B. What are the Benefits of this course of action? R. What are the Risks? A. What are the Alternatives? I. (disputed) Intuition/What are the Implications? N. What if we do Nothing? Some people add an S, though not apparently for “What about Shrewsbury and Telford?”. But it would be unfair, given the scale of the childbirth training industry, the variety of campaigning groups and professional doulas, to single out the NCT for encouraging women to fetishise choices and births that will not, for many, be achievable. With “normal” increasingly redefined, thanks to Ockenden, as a potentially dangerous goal, and the catchy but fatuous “natural” finally recognised – though by no means everywhere – as insensitive to women compelled by nature to accept technological assistance, a range of replacement synonyms testifies to the continued market for minimal intervention. Either that or to continued suspicions about NHS provision. If there are any anti-pain or pro-science groups out there for the many women who think nature totally fucked up childbirth, they have yet to compete with programmes described as positive, relaxed, physiology-informed, active, sacred – and still, pace Ockenden, “natural”. There’s not much you can teach or sell a person who’d prefer to give birth in a nicely lit operating theatre. More adventurous participants can be tempted, on the other hand, with everything from birthing balls to, for those who don’t want to make smoothies, placenta jewellery. So perhaps it’s a bit optimistic to identify, as some are doing, proliferating accounts of the traumatic consequences of ideologically delayed intervention, as natural childbirth’s “MeToo” moment. The history of the movement chronicles a remarkable ability to survive, along with the occasional tragedies, repeated testimony from the mothers it has left, even with healthy infants, feeling like failures. It probably helped that these regrets were the unintended legacy – since we lost Dick-Read – of kindly, idealistic women, as opposed to a technocratic fraternity. Although, when they realised the amazing savings of low intervention, men could also experience the special pleasure of being simultaneously feminist and authoritarian. If the revised, post-Ockenden lessons eventually get through to the sort of trusts that were advertising earlier this month for midwives “committed to the philosophy of normal birth”, the wider culture still promoting this approach may be harder to challenge. Outside hospitals, a prosperous industry revolves around the coaching required, as in the days of Dick-Read, for truly instinctive birth. Within the NHS, where hypnobirthing classes are currently in vogue, a sympathy for the “normal” plainly informs classes, such as those in Thurrock, where women can learn to “relax, breathe and trust their body to know what to do instinctively”. At the Cambridge Rosie hospital, a £39 video tutorial offers “significantly less pharmacological pain relief” and “a tool for increasing normal births and reducing operative delivery rates”. Should women not be that fussed for themselves, the Rosie goes further: “Babies born using hypnobirthing techniques tend to be more alert, calm, feed better and sleep better as they have been brought into the world at their own pace in a more calm and gentle way.” For anyone not keen on a dull yet agitated and wakeful baby with no appetite, there could hardly be a more powerful incentive to internalise that caesarean-defying acronym, Brain, and to understand Ockenden’s findings as an affront to everything the great Grantly Dick-Read once held dear.

4/17/2022,"Senior Tories have warned that traditional supporters are abandoning them after Boris Johnson’s Partygate fine, as another MP broke cover to say the prime minister should be removed over his conduct. Conservative MPs across the country said yesterday they believed many people who had backed the party before were now raising concerns, with Downing Street braced for further fixed-penalty notices relating to parties in the coming days. Writing in the Observer, former immigration minister Caroline Nokes said she was sticking with her decision to submit a letter of no confidence in the prime minister. It makes her the latest MP to back a leadership contest since the lockdown breach fines were issued to the prime minister and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, last week. She also highlighted correspondence suggesting previously secure voters were expressing concerns. She writes: “There are those who say these emails are only from ‘the usual suspects’. It is true to say there have been a smattering of them, the political activists who send an automated email at the drop of a hat. But they are very much in the minority. “The bulk of the emails I received last week are from people who are genuinely distressed at the family events they could not and did not attend, and many are from people I know who have long been Conservative supporters. “I have not withdrawn the letter of no confidence in Boris Johnson that I wrote months ago to Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the [Tory backbench] 1922 Committee, because to do so would be letting down all of those people who spent the pandemic doing the right thing.” Other Tory MPs, including serving ministers, said they believed some sections of their voters were being alienated. A number of them said that the party was trying so hard to hold on to newer, pro-Brexit voters that many traditional supporters were being put off, by Partygate and by the government’s plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. “If you go to our newer working-class, blue-collar voters, I’m not sure they’re that bothered,” said one northern Tory MP. “But if you go to our traditional middle-class Tory voter, they’re angry. That’s how I would define it. I think he should’ve resigned.” A minister said: “We’re going down a route that isolates the people in the middle. I don’t know whether there’s enough votes on the right and the core of the party to get us through. I just think it’s offensive and it’s doing real brand damage. I’m just appalled.” One former minister said: “There’s a couple of what I call ‘barometer people’ have come to me and said: ‘Look, we’re still angry with him. We don’t think he should resign at the moment, because we’ve got the Ukraine crisis, but he shouldn’t lead us into the next election.’ These are people who I know are Conservative supporters.” The news comes with Tory MPs demanding further contrition from Johnson when he meets them after parliament returns this week. He has pledged to give a fuller explanation for his earlier denial that parties had taken place. There are also likely to be demands this week for a vote on referring the prime minister to the cross-party privileges committee over whether he misled MPs about Downing Street lockdown parties. Some MPs critical of Johnson believe they have only a few months to decide whether he is the right person to lead them into the next election. “As a party, we have to make a decision about Boris by summer recess,” said an MP. “If we haven’t done it by then, Boris will lead us into the next general election.” Labour leader Keir Starmer called on Tory MPs to remove Johnson. “He is unfit for office and every day he remains in Downing Street degrades his office further,” he said. “The cabinet, ministers and Tory MPs must realise this is not going to change and every time they defend Boris Johnson, they embroil themselves in his web of lies. Are they really prepared to stand by and do nothing as his behaviour brings their party into disrepute? Only Conservative MPs have the power to bring this shameful saga to a close. If the prime minister is not going to resign, then they must take action when parliament returns this week to send a clear message that honesty and integrity in public life still matters.” A new Opinium poll for the Observer suggests that the fines for Johnson and Sunak have had a more immediate impact on the chancellor’s popularity, which has hit a record low. The proportion of voters approving of the chancellor was 24%, with 49% disapproving. His net approval rating of -25 is his lowest ever. Johnson remains on a net approval rating of -26. The Metropolitan police are also coming under growing pressure to explain their approach and the timing of their decision to fine senior politicians for breaches of lockdown regulations. Unmesh Desai, a Labour member of the Greater London authority’s police and crime committee, said he and colleagues were concerned that the Met had chosen to reveal last week’s politically explosive Partygate findings at a time parliament was not sitting. Desai, a former chair of the committee that examines the work of the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime, which in turn oversees the Met, said: “The timing and the manner of the announcement raise more questions than answers.” Desai also wanted to know why a drip-feed policy on the force’s fining decision had been adopted by the Met, a strategy he said had no precedent. He said the committee would be asking Sir Stephen House – the acting head of the Met until a new commissioner is appointed – why the force had decided to release findings of the investigation in a piecemeal way.",News/Politics,Senior Conservatives fear traditional voters will desert them after Partygate,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/16/senior-conservatives-partygate-fines-boris-johnson-rishi-sunak
