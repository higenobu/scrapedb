With her pencil-thin eyebrows, corkscrew curls and elastic mouth, Ball was known and loved for her starring role in the 1950s sitcom I Love Lucy. Kidman and writer-director Aaron Sorkin are less interested in recreating her gift for physical comedy than they are in fleshing out her serious side. Kidman has been funny before (she’s a hoot in To Die For and The Paperboy). Not so here. “I care about what works. I care about what’s funny,” she says, forehead wrinkling. Still, it’s a brilliant performance; witty, fierce and technical. Taking place over the course of a single episode of the show, from Monday’s table read to Friday’s live audience taping, the film mostly plays out on soundstages and Hollywood backlots. We also get a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the crumbling relationship between Ball and Desi Arnaz (Javier Bardem), her husband both on and off screen. Both are digitally enhanced in flashback scenes, a technique that is at once distracting and creepy.  The film is obsessed with deconstructing good screenwriting, the way a line lands, and ensuring clear character motivation. Fans of Sorkin’s own dense, rhythmic screwball dialogue will enjoy watching Alia Shawkat and Jake Lacy trade zingers in the writers’ room.

12/12/2021,"Born in Canada in 1972, the actor Tanya Moodie began her career in theatre. In 2020 she won a Royal Television Society breakthrough award for playing alpha mum Meg in the BBC Two sitcom Motherland. She has appeared in Sherlock and Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, and performed in numerous stage productions for the RSC, Royal Court and the National Theatre. Moodie has been a practising Buddhist since 1994, and lives in south London with her partner and daughter. Her latest theatre role is in Alice Childress’s 1955 play Trouble in Mind, directed by Nancy Medina, at the National Theatre, London, until 29 January 2022. The Motherland Christmas special is on BBC Two, Monday 20 December, 10.20pm.  Lady in Waiting: My Extraordinary Life in the Shadow of the Crown by Anne Glenconner I couldn’t tear myself away from this book. My Buddhist faith is primarily concerned with developing an indomitable spirit through overcoming life’s many ups and downs, and Lady Glenconner’s memoir reads as a manual for doing just that. She was a lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret, and you could look at someone like that and think their life is perfect, but she overcame a lot of personal struggles. She is a consummate storyteller, and her compassionate nature jumps off the page. And I like autobiographies because I get to be nosy; I spent a lot of time Googling the people she talked about. Shazam I am a song magpie, and frequently use Shazam to identify and immediately download any song I hear that I suddenly can’t live without. BBC Radio 6 Music is on at our house all day, every day, and it’s always an eclectic mix – I Shazam a lot of stuff from Guy Garvey’s show on Sundays. I listen to just about every genre: my last two downloads were a 1955 album compilation of Bulgarian folk songs and Aaliyah’s 2000 single Try Again. I will definitely caterwaul along to all of it. Bunsik, London WC2 My daughter and I have fallen in love with these Korean corn dogs from Bunsik in Covent Garden. It’s not a well-rounded meal. It’s not one of your five a day. But it’s really fun street food – eating one is an event. We both just get such a kick out of it. So sometimes as a treat, if I’m in that part of town I’ll pop in and get some for us and reheat them in the oven at home. Our favourite is the one that’s half hotdog and half mozzarella stick, covered in cornmeal batter and breadcrumbs and deep fried. It’s just fantastic. Succession My boyfriend and I are addicted to Succession. I mainly spend each episode shouting at the television. It’s the family we love to hate. I love the King Lear structure of it: “Prove to me who loves me the best.” I keep saying to my partner: “Why don’t they just walk away?” and he’s just like: “Because they want the money, babes.” Everyone’s work is impeccable: it’s extremely well written and well researched. I was at Rada with Matthew McFadyen and I just love him to bits in real life. It tickles me to scream at his character every week. Kill Bill: Volume 1 and 2 (dir. Quentin Tarantino) An important part of our courtship when my boyfriend and I met was exchanging lists of our favourite films and then watching each other’s suggestions. One of mine was Kill Bill – I will never get tired of it. I practically have passages memorised. I love that it’s a classic hero’s journey, but Tarantino has borrowed from all these other cinematic and literary styles and brought it all together in such an incredibly satisfying and exciting way. My daughter alerted me to “good for her” films – in which the girl triumphs in the end – and I would put Kill Bill in that category. Abe Odedina I’ve been collecting Abe’s paintings for some years now: I used to drive by his gallery in Brixton and I loved his work. He used to be an architect, then took a hiatus, went to Brazil and started to paint. The pigments are vibrant and rich, and he describes himself as a folk artist – he’s inspired by African art and magical realism. I have a painting by Abe called Amazing Grace: it’s a woman standing on a red backdrop in a royal blue dress. She has very dark ebony skin and red lips, and the whites of her eyes are very bright. I was mesmerised.

12/12/2021,"An adrenaline-pumping knife chase through graffiti-sprayed lanes takes place in the comedy-thriller The Outlaws, while class tensions simmer at a lavish student ball in the legal drama Showtrial. The city providing the backdrop and inspiration for both these series is Bristol – a location now so popular with film and TV makers that crews are actually falling over themselves in the streets. The city council has been inundated with requests to film in the city’s dank alleys, high-rises and grand Georgian squares since the beginning of the year, according to Bristol Film Office, which is part of the city council. It has seen a 225% increase in drama production on pre-pandemic levels. In the first quarter of 2019/20 there were four major drama productions under way in Bristol – but this more than tripled to 13 in the first quarter of 2020/21. Since January, 15 high-end TV dramas have been filmed in the city.  “The last year has been like nothing we have experienced,” says Natalie Moore, who manages Bristol Film Office. “We were totally inundated by the amount of filming. It was noticeable in the city too – everyone seemed to come across filming. There were a few clashes. We had crews turning up on the same day on the same street.” The city has long been a hub of nature films and animation; it is the home of the BBC’s Natural History Unit and the Oscar-winning Aardman Animations. But now, drama writers are increasingly setting the action in Bristol and drawing on its diverse cultures and rich, evolving history. The city’s role in momentous national events, such as the toppling of the statue of the slave trader Edward Colston, has inspired plotlines. The Outlaws, filmed in locations throughout the city, follows seven bickering lawbreakers, including Myrna, a veteran anti-racist campaigner, who is ordered to do community service for “tearing down that statue of Edward Colston”. Stephen Merchant, who wrote and starred in the show and grew up in Bristol, rewrote parts of the script while filming to reflect the mass protest in June last year. The city was more than just a backdrop, says Merchant. “For The Outlaws, I wanted Bristol to be another character in the show. Although a lot of filming takes place in Bristol, the city is often doubling for somewhere else; it hasn’t played itself very often, but it’s such a visually interesting place. I’m actually nervous about extolling its virtues too much because it will be overrun with productions and I won’t be able to get anyone next time I film there.” Whereas The Outlaws takes viewers into the deprived, desperate parts of the city, Showtrial dwells on the lives of wealthy students. Simon Heath, its executive producer, feels the city has too often been overlooked: “It has its own unique identity, culture and accent – yet has hardly been seen in TV drama. We needed a city known for having a prestigious university sought after by students from privileged backgrounds. So Bristol was a no-brainer.” Another successful drama, this time from Channel 4, Before We Die used many locations around the city, with one of the producers calling it “an interesting, quasi-European” city. The public sector has provided much of the infrastructure for the city’s drama boom. Ten years ago, the council turned an abandoned bottling plant in one of the most deprived wards in the country into the largest studio facility in the west of England. The Bottle Yard Studios, which is one of only two council-owned studios in the country, has eight stages, with three more opening next summer, following an £11.3m investment from the West of England metro mayor, Labour’s Dan Norris. The forthcoming BBC and HBO psychological thriller, The Girl Before, has been filmed in the studio and on locations in Bristol. “It is very unusual to have a council-run studio but it has been hugely successful,” says Laura Aviles, who manages the complex. “It allows us to deliver social benefits, including training local people to work in the industry.” Thispublic investment – alongside Bristol’s burgeoning reputation as a “Green Hollywood” of natural history film-making – has allowed independent production companies to take root in the city. According to research by the University of the West of England, Bristol has the largest concentration of such companies outside London, with a growing number making dramas. “There are now 188 production companies in Bristol,” says Prof Andrew Spicer from UWE. “The city has developed a critical mass of expertise. There is a large pool oftalented production staff and cheaper studio space than London.” For Bristol deputy mayor Craig Cheney, the turnaround in the city fortunes is striking. “[The boom in high-end drama is] bringing Bristol to a new audience that less than a decade ago may have seen us as a west of England backwater but now see a different, confident city with all the challenges and complexities an urban area brings.”",News/UK news,Why TV crews are falling over each other to film drama in ‘Bristolywood’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/11/bristol-film-tv-crews-drama-locations-bristolywood
12/12/2021,"Close the curtains. Light the fire. Then prepare to be terrified; it’s Christmas. For although the word “cosy” may be closely tied to festivities at this time of year, so it seems is the word “ghost”. In northern Europe people understandably cope with the shorter days and darker evenings by drawing in around a roaring hearth, metaphorical or otherwise. Light and warmth: it makes sense. But what kind of stories are told while friends and families gather together? The answer, of course, is the spookier, the better.  The most effective of these frightening Christmas tales tend to begin with a carefully paced account of an uncanny experience that once troubled a former acquaintance, leading to a chain of events so appalling that, even in the retelling, goosebumps appear and the skin crawls. Writer and actor Mark Gatiss, an expert in the form, sees a long tradition. “Perhaps it all began with the idea of telling stories round a campfire, of the shadows lengthening and us all clustering together for warmth and security, but there’s always been an affinity between Christmas time and ghosts,” Gatiss told the Observer in a month in which he is tapping into the spooky side of yuletide on stage and screen. “‘There was a man dwelt by a churchyard’, begins Shakespeare’s Mamillius, as he tells a story of sprites and goblins in where else but The Winter’s Tale. I think it’s very deep in the race.” The custom of ghostly yarns at the end of the year is more commonly traced back to Charles Dickens. A Christmas Carol was the Victorian novelist’s most successful ghost story, but not his only one: his novella The Chimes followed in 1844 and soon after The Haunted Man and the Ghost’s Bargain. A generation later came the short stories of Montagu Rhodes James, the Cambridge academic now acknowledged as an early 20th century master of the genre. His stories, repeatedly set in bleak, wintry landscapes, are particularly relished at Christmas and for the last 12 years occasional screen versions of James’s chilling tales have been made by Gatiss, who seems determined to disturb as many revellers as he can. After perfecting the modern grotesque in his television work with The League of Gentlemen, the darkly comic troupe he founded with Steve Pemberton, Reece Shearsmith and Jeremy Dyson, Gatiss went on to write for Doctor Who and to reimagine Sherlock, which became one of the BBC’s biggest hits for many years. Last year he introduced us to Claes Bang’s perturbing Dracula, in a one-off drama series for BBC1. This month, Gatiss’s mission to unsettle the nation is three-pronged. Not content with playing the ghost of Marley in his own adaptation of A Christmas Carol at the Alexandra Palace Theatre in London, he is offering viewers two atmospheric screen treats on Christmas Eve. The first, on Sky, is The Amazing Mr Blunden, a supernatural tale of time travel first adapted in 1972 from Antonia Barber’s novel. His second drama is the latest in his string of James stories made for BBC Two. This time Rory Kinnear stars in The Mezzotint, perhaps the best known short story of the lot. It follows Gatiss’s adaptations of Martin’s Close in 2019, The Dead Room in 2018, The Tractate Middoth in 2013 and Crooked House in 2008. The Mezzotint, which revolves around the hair-raising properties of an engraving of a manor house, has not been adapted as often as other stories, perhaps due to its focus on just one mysterious image. It did, however, make it on to the BBC in the 1950s and was read by Robert Powell on screen in 1986. It has also been plagiarised a fair few times, including in a pilot episode of a 1969 American series called Night Gallery that starred Roddy McDowall. Gatiss has given his cast, which includes Frances Barber and Robert Bathurst, some new twists – and some subtle red herrings. The setting, at the fictional Canterbury College, Oxford, in 1922, has what for Gatiss is the crucial combination of clubbable appeal and demonic dread: something that recalls the duality of the popular Danish idea of “hygge” and its grim flip-side of “unhygge”, a fearful place inhabited by trolls. Christmas is the right moment to savour these contrasting moods, Gatiss believes: “It is a time when we’re inevitably looking back, to all the Christmasses of our past and those who are sadly no longer gathered round the tree. It can be a very melancholy time for many and it’s always seemed to me that, even more than at Halloween, the boundary between this world and the next (if you believe that sort of thing) is at its thinnest. And though the ghost story is a very English tradition, there’s a strong parallel in other countries where the onset of winter and darkness bleeds over into an ancient storytelling culture.” Dickens understood the sombre note struck at Christmas, Gatiss argues, citing a passage in Pickwick Papers in which the family gathering summons up memories of those “whose hearts throbbed so gaily” but have now “ceased to beat”. “There is also the allure of what James called ‘a pleasing terror’,” said Gatiss. “That there’s something especially satisfying about being inside, cosy and warm while telling stories of horrible apparitions and ghastly visitations. James’s readings took place within the delightful walls of his college rooms, as an after dinner treat and though they can be very nasty, they’re also filled with humour, funny voices and all the trappings of a good yarn. So we, like James’s audience, demand a crackling fire, a glass of madeira, frost on the window panes, and then a story to unsettle and chill the blood before order is restored and we plunge off into the freezing night … and perhaps wondering who that dark shape might be that seems so doggedly to follow our footsteps…?”",Arts/Culture,‘There’s always been an affinity between Christmas and ghosts’: Mark Gatiss on the joy of festive frights,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2021/dec/11/theres-always-been-an-affinity-between-christmas-and-ghosts-mark-gatiss-on-the-joy-of-festive-frights
12/12/2021,"It is hard to find something to dislike about Michael Sheen. You have to really try: I managed to squeeze out the fact that he didn’t much enjoy his bow tie in Good Omens, but it took some effort. In an interview with the Big Issue last week, Sheen raised the Decent Bloke stakes again by explaining that he had “essentially turned myself into a social enterprise, a not-for-profit actor”. This is not some Jeremy Strong-style method approach, in which Sheen, playing the role of Social Enterprise, goes all-in to benefit the community. Or maybe it is, in a way; he revealed that he is putting the majority of his future earnings into good causes. “I don’t want to just be someone who enjoys the fruits of what other people have done and then pull the drawbridge up and go, ‘Well I’m all right, Jack, I’ve had a nice time’,” he said.  I thought about Sheen’s decision, to have enough for himself and to do something good with the rest of it, when I read another piece, by Courtney Love in the Financial Times, in support of the paper’s campaign to advocate for wider financial literacy. One idea stood out and, although it is not radical, I was surprised to find that it sounded as if it was. “I don’t think artists should be expected to be billionaires,” she said, arguing that a poet, for example, doesn’t need a second home. “I think artists should get what we call ‘right-sized’ about what to expect from their careers.” In their individual ways, both are raising the question of what it means to have enough. It’s old-fashioned as an idea. We live in an era, and a culture, that not only prioritises growth for the sake of it, but fetishes it. Everything is about having bigger, better, more, from desserts piled high with other desserts until they’re photogenic enough for Instagram, to the absurd expansion in car size that means parents drive their kids down the road to school in vehicles more suited to country tracks or Ben Nevis. The wealth gap in Britain has widened to a sickening degree during the pandemic. Obviously, I am talking about one end of it and that is not the people struggling to put food on the table with any regularity. In the world of work, we are largely expected to strive for more: promotions, a pay rise, more status, more money, infinite growth. Philosophers and economists have long grappled with the idea that this is unsustainable. On an individual level, though, we are rarely asked to consider what is enough. To consider what is “right-sized” for us. Google’s annual end-of-year round-up of search trends showed that in 2021, the world searched for a lot of cricket, a lot of superhero movies and a lot of Squid Game. In the UK, we still preferred football and made space for Line of Duty, wanted to know when Love Island finished more than we wanted to know when lockdown started, were less interested in Pete Davidson than we were in Matt Hancock and persisted with making the ubiquitous banana bread. But most shocking was the news that searches for “mittens” reached an all-time high in January, thanks to Bernie Sanders keeping his hands warm, cottagecore-style, at the presidential inauguration. It was shocking because how, by any measure, apart from calendars and clocks, was that this year? I don’t wish to deny mittens their moment in the spotlight, because it’s taken them forever to hit that record for most searches. But I could have sworn that Sanders wore those mittens at least 15 years ago, that those memes about him sitting grumpily loaded up slowly on a BlackBerry screen. As if that happened less than 12 months ago. I simply refuse to believe it. It had to be done. The Sex and the City reboot And Just Like That… was a rare moment of must-see TV, at least among my friends. On Thursday, there was a synchronised press-play, a flurry of texts, though “are you watching?” quickly became “what... are we watching?” The cast ploughed on gamely, but it was a strange experience; there was little sense that these characters had actually aged while they were off screen, more a sensation that they had been picked up in 2004, when Sex and the City ended (I am ignoring the films, which is a kindness), and plopped back down in the present day, where they stared, baffled, at a world in which people said “woke” and confused them with their newfangled podcasts. One of the oddest things was the feeling that the characters were too famous to be believable on screen. This is fairly normal with actors; there are some who only play tweaked versions of the same thing and look like Bambi on ice when they try to do something different. But I didn’t get the impression that these famous women were struggling to lose themselves in the characters, more that the characters were struggling to lose themselves in the story. Also, there was hardly any sex, not helped by the most fond-of-sex character Samantha being famously indisposed, although I did enjoy the loose explanation as to why she’d chosen London over this. Until that twist at the end of episode one, I don’t think anyone could blame her. Obviously, I will be watching every week, just to make sure.

12/12/2021,"Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was left out of Arsenal’s matchday squad to face Southampton due to what Mikel Arteta described as a “disciplinary breach”. The club captain did not train on Friday and was subsequently not named in the party to face Saints at the Emirates. Arteta did not give a more specific reason for omitting Aubameyang, who was dropped to the bench for the defeat against Everton on Monday night after a period of spluttering form.  “Unfortunately due to a disciplinary breach,” Arteta said when asked about the reason for Aubameyang’s absence. “We’ve been very consistent that there are certain non-negotiables in the team that we have set ourselves, and as a club, and he’s not involved today.” Questioned on whether the ban would extend beyond Saturday’s game, Arteta said: “It starts today. But certainly it’s not an easy situation, a situation that we want to have our club captain in.” Arteta has taken action against Aubameyang before, dropping him to the bench for the derby against Spurs in March after he reported late. He was also reminded of his responsibilities by the club in February after apparently breaching Covid-19 regulations to get a tattoo. The latest infraction will exasperate Arteta and may cast his status as captain into doubt. Aubameyang has not scored in his last six appearances and was only afforded five minutes of action at Goodison Park, with the out-of-favour Eddie Nketiah introduced as a substitute before him.

12/12/2021,"Raheem Sterling’s 100th Premier League goal came via the penalty spot and gave Manchester City a sixth consecutive win in the competition. This is a precious victory as here was an odd contest that featured serial ill-temper, head clashes, a ridiculous sending-off for Raúl Jiménez and, until Sterling’s intervention, Wolves threatening to escape with a point despite the mountain of chances created by the champions. Even Jonathan Moss’s award of Sterling’s spot-kick was controversial as Bernardo Silva’s cross hit João Moutinho’s armpit – is this, actually, handball? – and VAR duly backed the referee. Sterling’s penalty was one of those slow, straight down the middle affairs that had José Sa diving right and, so, the wrong way.  In scoring the No 7 became the 32nd to achieve the century, joining Harry Kane, Jamie Vardy, Romelu Lukaku, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané as the active players on the list. City might have had more: a Sterling dink in had the clumsy Jack Grealish missing an open goal, then, later, close-range shots from Silva and Gabriel Jesus were somehow blocked. Pep Guardiola’s shuffle of his stellar pack had featured Kevin De Bruyne, Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez starting on the bench against an XI including Adama Traoré, who scored both in Wolves’s 2-0 win here two years ago. Instantly what would be the pattern was set. City prodded the ball about in those familiar percussive rhythms, while Wolves hoped to nab it and unleash the speed of Traoré, as when Jiminez hit a pass along the left and Rúben Dias was turned. Silva has been receiving weekly notices for his dazzling displays and Romain Saïss soon saw why. João Cancelo thumped the ball to his feet and a hip-sway later the Portuguese was firing marginally wide of Sa’s goal. There was nothing slight about how Traoré barged Rodri over near the technical area in the first sign of bad mood. This caused Guardiola to yelp in protest and signalled Bruno Lage’s side would mix it when required. This came in a phase in which Wolves had quietened City, a Silva run-and-cross to the lurking Grealish a rare foray. Jesus provided another collector’s item when next trying to claim a penalty: running past Saïss the Brazilian stuck out a leg in a transparent manner and hit the deck. Moss, correctly, was not interested. Next came a pause due to a fierce clash of heads between Ruben Neves and Maximilian Kilman. The latter, face bloodied, was bandaged up and continued, as did the former. Moments later, another break in play. Sterling galloped past Saïss who appeared to receive a hand in the face. Cue the Moroccan going down and being branded a “cheat” by the home faithful. In this strange passage, Jiménez’s sending off trumped all. After being booked for fouling Rodri he stood at close range, blocked the free-kick, saw yellow again then red. The Mexican became pantomime villain, dawdling, twice throwing one of his gloves to ground – the crowd punctuating this with jeers. Humour, though, became bad temper when Neves went down near goal and City continued on and Grealish’s cross appeared to be hand-balled – by the top of Kilman’s right arm, but no penalty was awarded. City were furious at this, Wolves at the contest not having stopped. Underlying all of this was how City were disrupted and thus the second half had to be, for them, about finding their usual poise. For a while, they continued to grasp and come up empty-handed. A Sterling burst in Wolves’s area had him losing the perpendicular with Rayan Aït-Nouri challenging but, once more, Moss was not interested, and more frustration followed when Ilkay Gündogan’s header was cleared off the line by Connor Coady. But, City thumped at the door.. And, Sterli=ng was the one to finally force a way through, Wolves rueing an added-time chance to pilfer an equaliser as Ederson collected from a corner.",Sport/Football,Sterling spot-on as Manchester City do just enough against 10-man Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/dec/11/manchester-city-wolves-premier-league-match-report
