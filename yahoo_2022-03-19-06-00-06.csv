3/19/2022,"On Wednesday. the White House announced a new $800 million military support package for Ukraine in a bid to help that country fight back against the ongoing Russian invasion. Part of the aid package is for cutting-edge aerial drones that experts say could prove exceedingly lethal to Russian forces. The list of weapons to be shipped, President Biden said, includes 9,000 anti-armor systems, 7,000 small arms and 100 tactical unmanned aerial systems. A U.S. official later confirmed to ABC that the aerial systems to be sent would be small Switchblade drones. Manufactured by the California company AeroVironment, the drones come in two variations: the Switchblade 600 and the 300. The latter is built to hit at smaller and more precise targets; the 600 is built to strike armored vehicles and tanks. The 300 is less than 2 feet long, weighs 5.5 pounds and can fly up to 15 minutes. The larger drone weighs 50 pounds and can fly for 40 minutes over a range of 25 miles. Both can be carried in a backpack and deployed by individual soldiers. It has not been confirmed whether both models will be included in the shipment. According to its manufacturer, the drones can cruise at around 65 mph and come fitted with cameras and GPS systems. They are single-use, which means they explode after striking their target and are not recoverable after they have been launched. The Switchblades also have a “wave-off” feature so that operators can abort a mission if civilians appear near the target or if the enemy withdraws. “These were designed for U.S. Special Operations Command and are exactly the type of weapons systems that can have an immediate impact on the battlefield,” Mick Mulroy, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense, told ABC News. Ukraine’s drones have proved vital in carrying out successful attacks in the early stages of the invasion. Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute told Euronews that Ukraine had used drones to strike Russian forces before they were able to set up their air defenses in the battlefield. Watling went on to say that the Ukrainian army drones “have been essentially flying in at a low level and then coming up and raiding with them. So striking targets of opportunity.” A senior defense official confirmed the Switchblades’ effectiveness for Ukrainian forces by claiming that the drones would be useful in taking out long-range Russian artillery as Russia ramps up the bombardment of major cities in Ukraine. ""These tactical UAVs can be useful against Russian vehicles and artillery,"" the official told reporters this week. On Friday, the Times of London reported that an elite Ukrainian drone unit had destroyed dozens of “priority targets” by attacking static Russian forces as they slept. That specialist unit within the army, named Aerorozvidka, has reportedly been striking vehicles, including tanks and trucks, since the invasion began on Feb. 24. “We strike at night, when Russians sleep,” Yaroslav Honchar, the unit’s commander, said from his base in Kyiv. The latest allocation of military aid came after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on the West to “do more” in the fight against Moscow's aggression when he addressed Congress on Wednesday. In his speech, Zelensky invoked the horror of the 9/11 terror attacks as he pleaded for more military aid.",World/Yahoo News,Inside the cutting-edge Switchblade drones the U.S. is shipping to Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/inside-the-cutting-edge-switchblade-drones-the-us-is-shipping-to-ukraine-164754374.html
3/19/2022,"Sixteen GOP lawmakers voted against a House bill that seeks to promote public education on the history of Japanese Americans in World War II, including their incarceration in so-called “internment camps.”

The legislation, sponsored by Rep. Jay Obernolte of California — who is also a Republican — ultimately passed with 406 yeas on Wednesday, while 10 others did not vote.

Introduced as H.R. 6434, the bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to establish a “Japanese American World War II History Network” within the National Park Service (NPS). Such a network will consist of all NPS units and programs related to Japanese American history and experiences in World War II.

Those experiences will include the persecuted group’s time in “relocation centers” and “confinement sites,” the bill said. Such terms, however, are controversial, with advocates advising against their use due to their failure to capture the harsh conditions endured by those forced into them.

The Republicans who voted against the bill include Reps. Lauren Boebert (Colo.), Mo Brooks (Ala.), Michael Cloud (Texas), Louie Gohmert (Texas), Bob Good (Va.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), Andy Harris (Md.), Clay Higgins (La.), Trey Hollingsworth (Ind.), Doug LaMalfa (Calif.), Thomas Massie (Ky.), Mary Miller (Ill.), Ralph Norman (S.C.), Matt Rosendale (Mont.), Chip Roy (Texas) and Van Taylor (Texas).

The lawmakers had various reasons for registering their opposition. A spokesperson for LaMalfa told The Hill that while he generally supports the bill, there are concerns that a historical site in his district cannot sufficiently accommodate tourists at this time.

Harris said the House should prioritize other legislation. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Roy said the matter will better be handled by “private and charitable entities,” according to The Hill.

About 126,000 Japanese Americans were forced into concentration camps in World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, issued the executive order following the attack on Pearl Harbor.

Rep. Bruce Westerman (Ark.), the leading Republican on the House Natural Resources Committee, acknowledged the bill’s significance in honoring Japanese Americans. “[It] will be an important tool to ensure that this history, no matter how painful it may be, is always remembered, and the important stories of interned Japanese Americans are told with honor and respect,” he said.

Aside from the bill, the House reportedly passed legislation that would preserve the concentration camps and create a grant program to promote education on Japanese American incarceration.

3/19/2022,"The family of the 13-year-old who was driving a pickup truck in a Texas crash that killed nine, including New Mexico college golfers, “lost everything” in a fire late last year, according to a local pastor. The unidentified boy died in the Tuesday night collision along with his dad, Henrich Siemens, a 38-year-old passenger in the truck. Mennonite Evangelical Church Seminole Pastor Jake Fehr told NBC News on Friday that Siemens was the father of the boy. Fehr knew Siemens growing up, and the father and son’s funerals will be held at Mennonite Evangelical Church Seminole, even though they attended South Seminole Baptist Church. Fehr's sanctuary has more space. Fehr said the Siemens’ house burned down late last year. “The whole house burned down, they lost everything in that home,” he said, adding that the 13-year-old had siblings. Details on the fire and what caused it were not available Friday. Agatha Siemens, Henrich’s wife, had posted on Facebook in December asking for help getting photos off of her computer, which was damaged in the fire. ""My laptop was in the house during the fire but didn’t get burnt. Just water damaged. So I’m afraid to turn it on or charge it but would like to transfer all the pics I have on it to flash drives so I don’t lose them. Anyone know of someone?"" she asked. On Wednesday, she posted a collage of her family. ""In Loving Memory,"" it said. Her profile picture, which often said ""I love my husband,"" was changed to a picture of the couple. ""Love of my life,"" ""my best friend,"" ""Love you so much,"" said text on the picture. The truck the 13-year-old was driving had a spare wheel in place of its left front tire, National Transportation Safety Board Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said Thursday. That spare tire seemed to have failed, causing the truck to swerve in front of a van carrying members of New Mexico's University of the Southwest men and women’s golf teams Tuesday night. Six students and their coach died in the crash. Two students were flown to a Lubbock hospital in critical condition and were stable as of Thursday. Henrich Siemens and his son's funerals are planned for Tuesday and Wednesday, Fehr said. Pastor Richard “Buck” Wheat of South Seminole Baptist Church will officiate.",U.S./NBC News,"Family of driver, 13, in Texas crash 'lost everything' in fire last year, pastor says",https://news.yahoo.com/family-driver-13-texas-crash-182601170.html
3/19/2022,"Mikhail Fridman said he didn't know how to live after being hit by sanctions, Bloomberg reported. He said he had an allowance of $3,300 a month and needed UK government permission to spend money. He told Bloomberg he thought he had a good relationship with the West and ""couldn't be punished."" The Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman said in an interview that he didn't know how to live, three weeks after coming under sanctions, Bloomberg reported. Fridman, who has a net worth of $10.1 billion, Bloomberg's Billionaires Index said, was sanctioned by the European Union on February 28 and by the UK on March 15. He described the EU's sanctions as ""groundless and unfair"" at the time and said he would contest them, Reuters reported. Since the invasion of Ukraine began, Fridman's wealth dropped by $4 billion, Bloomberg reported. ""I don't know how to live,"" Fridman told Bloomberg. ""I don't know. I really don't know."" Video: People worldwide are protesting Russia's invasion of Ukraine Fridman, a cofounder of the London investment firm LetterOne and former board member of the Russian banking company Alfa-Bank, told Bloomberg that the sanctions meant that his last working UK bank card was frozen. Fridman, who lives in the UK, has an allowance of 2,500 pounds ($3,300) per month and has to apply for a license to spend money before the British government decides how reasonable the request is, he told Bloomberg. ""My problems are really nothing compared with their problems,"" he told Bloomberg, referring to Ukrainians trapped in the conflict. Fridman resigned from the board of Alfa-Bank one day after the EU sanctioned him. He also stepped down from the board of directors of LetterOne, the investment firm he cofounded. Fridman said he thought he had a good relationship with the West because of his trips to Washington and an Alfa-Bank fellowship program he set up for American, British, and German citizens in 2004. ""We sincerely believed we are such good friends of the Western world that we couldn't be punished,"" he told Bloomberg. Fridman is among the many Russians targeted by Western sanctions aimed at crippling Russia's economy and punishing President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine.

3/19/2022,"After three weeks of bitter and barbaric fighting in Ukraine, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov praised the coverage of the war from one American media outlet: Fox News. Speaking to the state-owned RT network, Lavrov said Fox News has been “trying to represent some alternative points of view” in its coverage of the war. “We understood long ago that there is no such thing as an independent Western media,” he said in the Friday interview, which was conducted in English. He went on to denounce the social media ban of former President Donald Trump and appeared to criticize the labeling of Jan. 6 insurrectionists as terrorists. “But when you watch other channels, read the social networks and internet platforms, when the acting president was blocked and this censorship continues in a very big way. The substitution of notions whenever something is happening by the way of mass protest, mass demonstrations, which they don’t like, they immediately call it domestic terrorism.” He added: “So it’s a war, and it’s a war which involves the methods of information terrorism.” Last Friday, Fox News host Tucker Carlson suggested that U.S. government officials wanted a war between Russia and Ukraine in a bid to “grab more power.” While otherwise denouncing the Russian invasion, Carlson theorized that the U.S. helped provoke the conflict after emergency powers enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic had come to an end. “At exactly the moment when the emergency powers they awarded to themselves to fight COVID started to wane, our leaders began pushing for conflict with Russia,” the Fox News host said. Meanwhile, retired United States Army Col. Douglas Macgregor declared on Carlson’s show on Thursday that Kyiv had lost the war with Russia and that Ukraine had been “grounded to bits.” The retired colonel added: “There’s no question about that, despite what we report on our mainstream media.” Most military experts, however, say the Russian advance is moving much slower than Moscow expected in the face of severe logistical problems and fierce Ukrainian resistance. Fox News hosts have continued to push certain talking points while reporting on Russia’s invasion, linking the war to various Biden administration policies. Three days into the invasion, “Fox and Friends” co-host Rachel Campos-Duffy declared it “a Green New Deal war,” stating, “This is John Kerry’s war. This is AOC’s war.” Two days before that, while covering Russia’s bombardment of Ukraine, Carlson accused the Biden administration of trying to “degrade and humiliate” the U.S. military by focusing on “white rage” and “maternity flight suits.” Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin has made waves for her near-constant correcting of the record set forth by the news network's opinion hosts, including primetime host Sean Hannity. And Fox News reporter Benjamin Hall corrected “The Five” co-host Greg Gutfeld in early March after Gutfeld complained about what he saw as a narrative presented solely through the eyes of the Ukrainians. “And they only go in one direction. And I understand why they only go in one direction, because it’s the invaded who experience the atrocity, right? And that’s all we’re going to see,” Gutfeld complained. Moments later, live on air, Hall rebuked the host for making those comments from a studio in New York. “Speaking as someone on the ground, I want to say that this is not the media trying to drum up some emotional response,"" Hall said from Ukraine. Gutfeld, whose mother-in-law escaped from Ukraine to Poland earlier this month, called it a “cheap attack” on him. Hall was wounded during a Russian attack just five days later. A cameraman, Pierre Zakrzewski, and a producer, Oleksandra Kuvshynova, who were both working for Fox News on the ground in Ukraine, were killed in the attack.",World/Yahoo News,Russian foreign minister praises Fox News for Ukraine coverage,https://news.yahoo.com/russian-foreign-minister-praises-fox-news-for-ukraine-coverage-184200756.html
3/19/2022,"Jessica Lopez remembers a red Ford F150 circling the block of East High School's north parking lot. She also remembers the face of the teenager who allegedly shot her in the head. ""She's awake,"" the 16-year-old's mother, Guadalupe Torres, said Thursday through an interpreter. Torres wore a gold rosary around her neck. ""And she can still see his face."" Lopez and another East High student, Kemery Ortega, were caught in the gunfire in what police said they believe was a drive-by shooting outside of the school on March 7. Both were shot in the head. Both survived. But Jose Lopez-Perez, 15 — whom police believe was the intended target of the shooting — was killed. Six local teenagers have been charged, each with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted murder. Previously: She was shot outside East High School, but this 'warrior' teen is now fighting through recovery Torres, 35, said her daughter was waiting outside to get picked up from school early. Then, Lopez heard gunshots, Torres said her daughter told her. A bullet went through her skull. Another hit her hand. Torres said Lopez remembers hearing more gunfire as she lay injured on the ground. When Torres found out about the shooting, ""I thought I was going crazy,"" she said. She drove to the school to see if it was true. She saw the crime scene. She asked police if her daughter was okay. ""They said they didn't know,"" Torres said. More: Six teens acted 'in concert' to shoot 15-year-old outside Des Moines' East High, criminal complaints allege Since the shooting, Torres has felt panic and fear, she said. When medical staff guided her to a private room at the hospital, her stomach dropped. She thought they would tell her her daughter didn't survive, she said. Her daughter is recovering but the fear hasn't left her, she said. Lopez has been waking up in the middle of the night screaming for help, Torres said. And when Lopez speaks, Torres said she can hear frustration and anger in her daughter's voice. Despite Lopez's progress, doctors have told Torres that the brain damage and injuries Lopez suffered have life-long consequences, she said. Doctors are still assessing the extent of the damage, and like Ortega, Lopez will also need titanium plates in her skull, she said. Torres said that her daughter sometimes doesn't remember her family or friends. But she's awake, she can talk, and she can eat without a feeding tube — she's been craving chicken nuggets, Torres said, chuckling. It was the last meal her daughter had before she was shot. The recovery process feels slow, but her daughter is strong, Torres said. The Des Moines community and beyond have been stepping up to help the victims of the shooting, including Lopez. As of Friday, a GoFundMe to support Lopez's recovery has raised nearly $12,000 More: Family of victim of shooting by East High remembers Jose Lopez-Perez, 15, as 'larger than life' Torres described her daughter as social. She loves to go out and dance with her boyfriend, she said, and she loves spending time with her family and friends. She's also tough, she said. She stands up for herself. “She also likes to have things her way,"" Torres added with a smile. Lopez is also compassionate and loves to help others, Torres said. And Lopez recently vowed to become a better person, Torres said. She had been taking her future and her path towards beauty school more seriously. Torres said there is so much uncertainly about what her daughter's life will look like after she's released from the hospital. ""The damage is done,"" Torres said. Now, she, like others from the community, is calling for action so guns aren't falling into the hands of children so what happened to her daughter will not happen again. More:  Gov.
