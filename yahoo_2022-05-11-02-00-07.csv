However, that norm may soon be a thing of the past, thanks to the future of airport technology. Ireland’s Shannon Airport implemented its new CT scanning security system in October 2021. This new technology allows liquids to have no restrictions on volume. Shannon Airport is not new to being a pioneer in the travel industry. In 1947, the airport opened the world’s first Duty-Free shop. In 2009, Shannon Airport became the first airport in the world to provide full US pre-clearance facilities. Donegal Airport, also located in Ireland, has installed the new technology, which costs around $2.6 million. The CT scans are similar to the ones used in hospitals. Airports will replace 2D scans with 3D imaging. Kevin Riordan, head of checkpoint solutions at Smiths Detection tells CNN Travel, “From a security point of view, they’re able to make very accurate decisions about what the materials are in your bag: Is it a likely threat material or is it benign. That’s better security, better decisions.” New technology means less time for travelers in airport security lines. The liquid ban came into play in August 2006, when a terrorist plot to detonate liquid explosives on multiple air crafts was stopped. Before the liquid ban, airport security lines moved more quickly.

5/11/2022,"Russian authorities in Ukraine’s occupied city of Donetsk are tossing the bodies of their dead soldiers in a secret dump “by the thousands” and charging their loved ones money to find them. That’s according to a new audio recording released by Ukraine’s Security Service on Tuesday, which is purportedly an intercepted telephone conversation between two Russians discussing how one of their missing friends was finally found. In the two-and-a-half minute recording, an unidentified man tells his female relative that the fate of “Inna’s brother” is finally known after he went missing a month ago. “It’s better that you don’t hear this,” the man says at first, reluctant to spill all the grim details. After more urging, he finally explains that the unidentified dead man’s “sister went to Donetsk, and there, basically, roughly speaking, is a dump.” The Only Winners at Putin’s Victory Day Parade? The Hackers Who Took Over Russian TV “They just toss them there. And then later it’s easier to make as if they disappeared without a trace. It’s easier for them to pretend they are just missing, and that’s it,” he said, noting that “there are thousands.” “There’s nowhere left to place them. It’s a dump. I’m telling you in plain Russian—a dump. It’s as tall as a person,” he said, adding that the site is “fenced off, sealed, they don’t let anyone in.” According to him, the only reason local authorities at the dump site let the woman find her brother was because she paid “good money.” Watch: Wiretaps appear catch Russian soldiers sabotaging their own equipment Russian soldiers have been sharing tips with one another about how to deliberately damage their own equipment  in Ukraine, according to recordings of alleged phone calls that the Security Service of Ukraine intercepted. After that, he said, “they rearranged it until she found [the body.]” “It’s not a morgue, it’s a dump.… They are bringing [bodies] by the thousands,” he said, calling it a “shitshow.” No further details were provided by Ukrainian intelligence on the exact location of the makeshift morgue, and it was not immediately clear if the man heard in the audio was a Russian soldier himself, though Ukrainian authorities described him as an “invader.” The disturbing intercept comes after Al Jazeera on Monday released footage of refrigerated train cars holding the unclaimed bodies of Russian troops killed in Ukraine. Inside, there appeared to be human-size bodies stacked on top of each other in white bags. Ukrainian authorities said Moscow has refused to take the bodies back home, apparently to keep the lid on the sky-high death toll. While Russia has claimed only 1,300 of its troops have died in its “special military operation” to rescue Russian-speakers in Ukraine (by bombing predominantly Russian-speaking areas), Ukraine’s military has put the death toll at about 26,000.

5/11/2022,"LONDON — Many observers expected Russia’s air force to blow away Ukraine’s forces in the opening days of the Kremlin’s invasion. Ukraine’s military would be left completely vulnerable as Russian warplanes could pick off targets at whim. But that hasn’t happened. More than two months later, Russia has still not established air supremacy over large swaths of Ukraine, despite having the world’s second-largest air force — and a highly advanced one at that. The New York Times reported Monday that, according to the U.S. Defense Department, Ukraine “continues to fly its own fighters and attack jets against Russian troops.” Russia’s air force has even been timid as Ukraine’s relatively scrappy anti-air defenses remain a formidable threat. NATO countries have done their best to flood Ukraine with man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS, like the U.S.-made Stinger missile. The Stinger system can be fired by a single operator, whose missile locks onto aircraft with infrared guidance. “The Western supplies of MANPAD and other types of air defense systems allowed Ukraine to increase and to improve its capabilities,” said Pavel Luzin, a Russian armed forces expert and contributor at the Jamestown Foundation. William Alberque, the director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Yahoo News that Ukraine was able to effectively distribute these air defenses so it became too dangerous for Russian combat flights. NATO countries have also been providing Ukraine with increasingly advanced military hardware as Russia’s war drags on. Slovakia announced last month that it had donated its Soviet-era S-300 long-range air defense system to Ukraine. Russia has been further hampered by its combat aircrafts’ lackluster weapons systems. U.S. officials say Russian pilots are “unable to quickly locate and engage targets on the ground,” and missiles launched into Ukraine “often miss their targets — if they work at all,” according to the Times. Alberque said Russian stocks of precision-guided munitions are significantly smaller than NATO’s. This observation was backed by security analyst Oliver Alexander, who said on Twitter that with Russia’s lack of precision-guided munitions, “they are forced to use dumb munitions [unguided bombs] to operate at scale.” But technology alone does not fully explain Russia’s failure to establish air superiority. Experts say Russia’s air doctrine has been poorly thought out and haphazardly executed from the opening days of the war. “They thought it would be all over very quickly, with a complete Ukrainian collapse at first contact and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky either captured or fleeing,” Alberque said. If the Kremlin had predicted Ukrainian resilience, the Russian military would have “done a lot differently and their air power would be far more devastating now,” he said. And because Moscow believed it would capture Ukraine the first few days, Russian military command was keen not to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure it wanted to keep for controlling the country after the war, Alberque said. Phillips Payson O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, and Edward Stringer, a retired Royal Air Force air marshal, published a Monday essay in the Atlantic delving into the Russian air force’s failures. They argued1 that the Russian military struggles to creatively use air doctrine because it is philosophically wedded to being a traditional land power with massive reserves of soldiers at its disposal. “When the invasion started, the Russian air force was incapable of running a well-thought-out, complex campaign,” they wrote. “Instead of working to control the skies, Russia’s air force has mostly provided air support to ground troops or bombed Ukrainian cities. In this it has followed the traditional tactics of a continental power that privileges land forces.”",World/Yahoo News,Why Russia's air force failed to dominate Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/why-russias-air-force-failed-to-dominate-ukraine-135016604.html

Russian President Vladimir Putin used Monday's festivities to justify his country's invasion of Ukraine. Melnikova, 21, won a gold and two bronze medals for the ROC at the Tokyo Olympics. A highly accomplished Russian Olympian was spotted posing with the pro-war ""Z"" symbol at Monday's Victory Day Parade. Angelina Melnikova — the gymnast who won team gold at the Tokyo Olympics before earning individual bronze medals in the all-around and floor exercise — attended the festivities in Moscow, which annually commemorates Russia's victory over the Nazis in World War II. This year, the celebrations doubled as a pro-war rally and a chance for President Vladimir Putin to justify his country's invasion of Ukraine. The 21-year-old posed alongside Russian military veterans and looked upon the Red Square processions, according to photos and videos she posted on her Instagram story. In one such post, Melnikova can be seen holding a red paper with a gold ""Z"" — which has become synonymous with Russia's invasion of Ukraine — while standing next to an older man in his military uniform. The star gymnast is far from the first Russian athlete seen publicly supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine since the war began. Svetlana Khorkina, who won seven Olympic medals between 1996 and 2004, has also shared various photos including the ""Z"" symbol to her Instagram, including one with the caption: ""A campaign for those who are not ashamed to be Russian.""

5/11/2022,"LAS VEGAS (AP) — Las Vegas is being flooded with lore about organized crime after a second set of human remains emerged within a week from the depths of a drought-stricken Colorado River reservoir just a 30-minute drive from the notoriously mob-founded Strip. “There’s no telling what we’ll find in Lake Mead,” former Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman said Monday. “It’s not a bad place to dump a body."" Goodman, as a lawyer, represented mob figures including the ill-fated Anthony “Tony the Ant” Spilotro before serving three terms as a martini-toting mayor making public appearances with a showgirl on each arm. He declined to name names about who might turn up in the vast reservoir formed by Hoover Dam between Nevada and Arizona. “I’m relatively sure it was not Jimmy Hoffa,” he laughed. But he added that a lot of his former clients seemed interested in “climate control” — mob speak for keeping the lake level up and bodies down in their watery graves. Instead, the world now has climate change, and the surface of Lake Mead has dropped more than 170 feet (52 meters) since 1983. The lake that slakes the thirst of 40 million people in cities, farms and tribes across seven Southwestern states is down to about 30% of capacity. “If the lake goes down much farther, it’s very possible we’re going to have some very interesting things surface,” observed Michael Green, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas history professor whose father dealt blackjack for decades at casinos including the Stardust and the Showboat. “I wouldn’t bet the mortgage that we’re going to solve who killed Bugsy Siegel,” Green said, referring to the infamous gangster who opened the Flamingo in 1946 on what would become the Strip. Siegel was shot dead in 1947 in Beverly Hills, California. His assassin has never been identified. “But I would be willing to bet there are going to be a few more bodies,” Green said. First, the dropping lake level exposed Las Vegas’ uppermost drinking water intake on April 25, forcing the regional water authority to switch to a deep-lake intake it completed in 2020 to continue to supply casinos, suburbs and 2.4 million residents and 40 million tourists per year. The following weekend, boaters spotted the decomposed body of a man in a rusted barrel stuck in the mud of newly exposed shoreline. The corpse has not been identified, but Las Vegas police say he had been shot, probably between the mid-1970s and the early 1980s, according to the shoes found with him. The death is being investigated as a homicide. A few days later, a second barrel was found by a KLAS-TV news  crew, not far from the first. It was empty. On Saturday, two sisters from suburban Henderson who were paddle boarding on the lake near a former marina resort noticed bones on a newly surfaced sand bar more than 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) from the barrels. Lindsey Melvin, who took photos of their find, said they thought at first it was the skeleton of a bighorn sheep native to the region. A closer look revealed a human jaw with teeth. They called park rangers, and the National Park Service confirmed in a statement that the bones were human. There was no immediate evidence of foul play, Las Vegas police said Monday, and they are not investigating. A homicide probe would be opened if the Clark County coroner determines the death was suspicious, the department said in a statement. More bodies will be discovered, predicted Geoff Schumacher, vice president of The Mob Museum, a renovated historic downtown Las Vegas post office and federal building that opened in 2012 as The National Museum of Organized Crime & Law Enforcement. “I think a lot of these individuals will likely have been drowning victims,” Schumacher said, referring to boaters and swimmers who’ve never been found. “But a barrel has a signature of a mob hit. Stuffing a body in a barrel. Sometimes they would dump it in the water.” He and Green both cited the death of John “Handsome Johnny” Roselli, a mid-1950s Las Vegas mobster who disappeared in 1976 a few days before his body was found in a 55-gallon (208-liter) steel drum floating off the coast of Miami. David Kohlmeier, a former police officer who now co-hosts a Las Vegas podcast and fledgling TV show called “The Problem Solver Show,” said Monday that after offering a $5,000 reward last week for qualified divers to find barrels in the lake, he heard from people in San Diego and Florida willing to try. But National Park Service officials said that's not allowed, and that there are hundreds of barrels in the depths — some dating to the construction of Hoover Dam in the 1930s. Kohlmeier said he also heard from families of missing people and about cases like a man suspected of killing his mother and brother in 1987, a hotel employee who disappeared in 1992, and a father from Utah who vanished in the 1980s. “You’ll probably find remains all throughout Lake Mead,” Kohlmeier said, including Native Americans who were the area's earliest inhabitants. Green said the discoveries have people talking not only about mob hits, but about bringing relief and closure to grieving families. Not to mention the ever-growing white mineral markings on steep lake walls showing where water used to be. “People will talk about this for the right reasons and the wrong reasons,” the professor said. “They’re going to think we’re going to solve every mob murder. In fact, we may see some. ""But it’s also worth remembering that the mob did not like murders to take place in the Las Vegas area, because they did not like bad publicity going out under the Las Vegas dateline.” The right reason, Green said, is the visible evidence that the West has a serious water problem. ""The ‘bathtub ring’ around the lake is big and getting bigger,” he said. Whatever story emerges about the body in the barrel, Goodman predicted it will add to the lore of a city that, with lake water, sprouted from a creosote bush-covered desert to become a marquee gambling mecca. “When I was the mayor, every time I went to a ground breaking, I’d begin to shake for fear that somebody I may have run into over the years will be uncovered,” he said. “We have a very interesting background,"" Goodman added. “It certainly adds to the mystique of Las Vegas.” ___ This story has been updated to correct that the Flamingo opened in 1946, not 1944.",U.S./Associated Press,Bodies surfacing in Lake Mead recall mob's time in Las Vegas,https://news.yahoo.com/investigators-try-id-2nd-set-144616933.html
5/11/2022,"Prince Charles stepped in for ailing Queen Elizabeth II on Tuesday to open Britain’s Parliament, a deeply symbolic moment in British royal history that gave the clearest glimpse yet of the contours of the post-Elizabethan world. Her Majesty left her decision to Monday afternoon to finally pull the plug on her scheduled role of opening the new legislative session, inevitably sparking fresh concerns that she is considerably more unwell than the palace—which cited “episodic mobility problems”—is letting on. Queen Elizabeth Will Skip Her Own Garden Parties, Stoking Health Fears Notably, Prince Charles, who was decked out in his military uniform, sat on a throne to read the Queen’s Speech (which is actually written by the government but traditionally delivered by the monarch) although it had previously been rumored he would avail of more humble seating options. Her Majesty’s crown rested symbolically on a velvet cushion on a small table next to him. Prince William sat on Charles’ right, wearing a dark morning suit; Camilla, his wife, sat on Charles’ left. They both sat on relatively normal chairs. While the queen would traditionally refer to “my government,” Charles referred to “Her Majesty’s government” throughout the speech. The palace said William and Charles were jointly opening Parliament, in their roles as counselors of state, and that the queen was watching the ceremony on television at Windsor Castle. The decision of Elizabeth to pull out of the event at the last minute has served to deepen national anxiety about her health, which has become a source of much comment since the death of her husband, Prince Philip, last year. The official line is that the queen has “mobility problems”—the terminology was updated in a briefing Monday to become “episodic mobility problems”—but this explanation is increasingly thought to be a major understatement, especially in light of the legal mechanism that the queen used to step away from Tuesday’s commitment: the Regency Act. The only time Britain has had a formal regency is under George III, who was periodically declared insane. George IV, the heir, was made regent and took on all his father’s duties. It is not unprecedented for the monarch not to make the ceremony. The queen has actually missed the state opening of Parliament twice, while she was pregnant, in 1959 (with Anne) and 1963 (with Edward). Queen Victoria regularly skipped this particularly duty, sending the crown on a velvet cushion, just as the queen did today. But an important if slightly obscure point is that on those occasions the monarchs asked a senior parliamentary official to fill in for her, essentially, an ad hoc basis. The big difference concerning Monday’s move was that the queen a) put her heir, Charles, in her place rather than using a mere functionary for the task and b) according to royal historian Robert Hardman, author of the new biography Queen of Our Times, she did so by invoking the Regency Act of 1937 and, specifically, Section 6 (1) which states: “In the event of illness… the Sovereign may… delegate, for the period of that illness or absence… such of the royal functions as may be specified.” Hardman told The Daily Beast: “The last time that an heir to the throne opened Parliament, he was called the Prince Regent, so it is understandable that is how some people are seeing this. But the fact is that a regency is something that is done on behalf of the monarch, and in this case the monarch has laid down the rules and asked for it to be done, which is an important distinction.” Hardman added that the situation is “genuinely unprecedented” and that that “everyone is slightly scrabbling around trying to figure out what happens next.” He pointed out that the new arrangement is not open-ended, it only applies to today. Charles is not now authorized to open Parliament automatically every year—although in truth it’s hard to imagine the queen now ever reprising the role. Despite the constituional niceties, it is not entirely surprising that the invoking of the Regency Act on as important occasion as the opening of Parliament is being seen by many as the first step toward a regency, although this is something Buckingham Palace calmly but robustly denies, insisting the queen still remains very much in charge. In most senses, she is. There is little doubt that her word is the final one. But today’s appearance by the future King Charles III marks an important line in the sand, and a window into what the future of British pomp and circumstance looks like. Read more at The Daily Beast.

Wrecked Russian fighter jets are being found with rudimentary GPS receivers ""taped to the dashboards"" in Ukraine because their inbuilt navigation systems are so bad, the UK's defense secretary, Ben Wallace, said. Speaking at the National Army Museum in London Monday, Wallace commemorated those who died in World War II and called Russia's invasion of Ukraine ""senseless and self-defeating."" He added that there was evidence suggesting Russian military hardware was being pushed to breaking point by the invasion of Ukraine. ""'GPS' receivers have been found taped to the dashboards of downed Russian Su-34s so the pilots knew where they were, due to the poor quality of their own systems,"" he said. ""The result is that whilst Russia have large amounts of artillery and armor that they like parading, they are unable to leverage them for combined arms maneuver and just resort to mass indiscriminate barrages,"" he added. The Su-34 was first manufactured in the Soviet Union in the early 1990s but is still one of Russia's leading fighter jets. Ukraine has shared abundant evidence of what it says are Russia's attempts to patch over issues with old military equipment and bypass equipment shortages. Last month, Ukrainian troops paraded what they said was a Russian drone that had been covered in duct tape and fitted with a generic plastic bottle top for a fuel cap. In March, Ukrainian troops found what appeared to be Russian army bandages dating to 1978 discarded on a battlefield. In his Monday speech, Wallace said Russian vehicles ""are frequently found with 1980s paper maps of Ukraine in them"" and that soldiers were using ""pine logs as makeshift protection on logistical trucks"" and attaching ""overhead 'cope cages' to their tanks."" Russia held its annual Victory Day military parade in Moscow on Monday but canceled the air force flyby over what it said was bad weather.

5/11/2022,"A 91-year-old Korean War Navy veteran is hoping to find his first love, who he met during his time as a second class petty officer in Japan in 1953.

Duane Mann, 91, wrote a Facebook post on May 1 hoping to find someone who recognizes the woman in a photo he took in 1953, whose name he says is Peggy Yamaguchi. In the post, Mann explains that while he was stationed in Japan from 1953 to 1954 at age 23, he met Yamaguchi at an Air Force NCO Club, where he worked as a slot machine repairman in his spare time and Yamaguchi worked as the “hat check girl.”

 

Mann recalls spending “a lot of time dancing together,” leading the two to fall in love and begin a relationship less than six months after meeting each other.

The couple planned to get married within three months; however, Mann was discharged two months early and sent back to the U.S. The 91-year-old says he had no choice but to leave her behind and that she was also pregnant at the time.

After returning home to Iowa in 1954, Mann discovered that his father had spent all of his savings, which he had planned to use to bring Yamaguchi to the U.S. Mann and Yamaguchi exchanged letters each week until, he says, he stopped receiving them after about a month.

Three months later, Mann received a letter from Yamaguchi stating that she had lost the baby and was married to an Air Force man from Wisconsin.

He also discovered that his mother had been burning Yamaguchi’s letters “because she didn’t want [him] to marry a Japanese girl.” He recalled feeling “devastated and deeply confused” at that moment and was “completely destroyed.”

“I don't know why I didn't become violently angry as I was so completely distroyed [sic] at the moment. So, I have spent the [last] 70 years trying to find Peggy because the most haunting thing of all is that she must have figured that I ABANDED [sic] HER!! I have never been able to shed this thought and have lived now to the age of 91 and carry a very heavy heart because of what all happened,” Mann wrote.

Mann added that he does not know Yamaguchi’s Japanese first name or her possible husband’s name and is hoping that someone who finds his Facebook post will recognize Yamaguchi.

""I AM HOPING, WITH ALL MY HEART, that this last posting can be SHARED to the extent that I may reach Peggy or a member of her family,"" he writes in his post.

5/11/2022,"By Elaine Lies TOKYO (Reuters) - An Elon Musk tweet saying Japan would ""eventually cease to exist"" without a higher birthrate set off a flood of sarcasm and anger on Monday - though much of the angst was aimed at a Japanese government many said did little to address the issue. Musk, the head of electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc, at the weekend tweeted, ""At risk of stating the obvious, unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist. This would be a great loss for the world."" The comment hit a nerve among Japan watchers and in Japan, whose population peaked in 2008 and has declined since due to its low birthrate to about 125 million as of last year despite government warnings and sporadic attempts to grapple with the issue. But Japan remains the world's third-largest economy, host to global heavyweights ranging from car manufacturers to games developers, and is a key link in global semiconductor supply chains. ""What is even the point of tweeting this?"" wrote Tobias Harris, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. ""The anxieties surrounding Japan's demographic future is not that 'Japan will eventually cease to exist' but rather the profound social dislocations that are occurring as a result of the decline to a lower population level."" Others noted sluggish birthrates plague many nations besides Japan, including Germany - where Tesla has just opened a new factory - and that Japan was simply being hit first. But many Japanese commentators said the situation was not surprising and slammed their government for not doing enough to fight it, such as by providing more daycare centres and making it easier for women to return to work after having children. ""They keep saying the birthrate's falling, but given that the government isn't taking thorough steps to deal with it, what can we say? Everything they say and do is contradictory,"" wrote Twitter user SROFF. ""In this environment, who's going to say 'Okay, let's have a child'? I despair for Japan.""

5/11/2022,"Russian soldiers booby-trapped a Ukrainian man's dead body in his own car trunk, according to Politico. His wife discovered his body and later brought Ukrainian troops to help move him, fearing a trap. When they tried to pull him from the trunk with a rope, the car ""exploded in a ball of flames."" Russian soldiers killed a Ukrainian army volunteer on the outskirts of Kyiv and left his dead body in his car trunk fitted with a mine that later exploded when Ukrainian forces attempted to move him, according to Politico. Lyudmyla Kyrpach, the soldier's widow, told Politico that she and her husband Oleksandr ""did everything together."" Kyrpach told the outlet that the day after the invasion began in late February, Oleksandr, a mechanic, organized volunteer fighters in his village of Kalynivka, near Kyiv. By March 1, days after Russian troops had encroached on their village, Oleksandr's friends set out driving to see if they could source more intel about Russian troop movements up close. She told Politico's Christopher Miller that after they failed to return, he set out to find them. ""He said he would be right back,"" Lyudmyla told Politico. Oleksandr never returned, and unable to sleep, Lyudmyla set out the following day with her friends to find him. She noticed his sedan on the road, with the keys in the ignition but no passengers in the car, she told Politico. Lyudmyla's friend noticed that the trunk was riddled with bullets, per the report, and they opened the trunk to find Oleksandr's dead body. Her friend pulled her away from the car in fear that the trunk could be booby-trapped, she explained to the outlet. By March 4 they returned to the scene with Ukrainian soldiers. According to the report, the soldiers tied ropes to his limbs and moved far from the car to pull slowly and see if the car was rigged. As soon as they pulled, the ""car exploded in a ball of flames."" Russian soldiers had placed weight-triggered mine under Oleksandr, Lyudmyla told Politico. ""Lyudmyla picked up the pieces of the man she had spent decades with and placed them in a box,"" Politico reported. Later, she buried him in the garden where they used to plant vegetables together. In April, the Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs had stated that Russia's attacks on civilians extended beyond artillery attacks, with officials saying they uncovered booby traps scattered throughout cities including Kyiv and Mariupol. ""The Russian Federation is in war not only with the Ukrainian Armed Forces but also fights against the civilian population of Ukraine, grossly violating the Law of war,"" the statement said.""While retreating Russia's military personnel is massively setting up booby-traps, banned by the international law, even on food facilities, private housing, and human corpses."" Last month, Ukrainian authorities unearthed a mass grave in Bucha, near Kyiv, claiming that Russian soldiers killed and buried at least 360 Ukrainians in a 45-foot-long trench. Journalists who visited Bucha after Russian troops pulled out also reported bodies of civilians in their homes, on the street, and in the suburb's glass factory.

5/11/2022,"The unsettling “sounds” of a black hole can finally be heard thanks to new NASA technology, and listeners are calling the result hypnotic and downright “terrifying.” NASA posted a 34-second recording on YouTube May 4, explaining the source of the sinister recording comes from deep within the Perseus Galaxy Cluster, some 250 million light years from Earth. “The popular misconception that there is no sound in space originates with the fact that most of space is essentially a vacuum, providing no medium for sound waves to propagate through,” NASA reported. “A galaxy cluster, on the other hand, has copious amounts of gas that envelop the hundreds or even thousands of galaxies within it, providing a medium for the sound waves to travel.” Those “ripples” have been made audible with a sound machine — a process called “sonification” — after NASA says it overcame the challenge of raising the “astronomical data” to a level humans can hear. NASA dodged describing the results from the black hole — which has such a strong gravitational pull that nothing, including light, can escape its invisible grasp — but the sound could be likened to ghostly howls ... or the collective moan of a billion lifeforms. There are more than 5,000 reactions and comments on NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center Facebook page, some using terms like “eerily beautiful” and “menacing,” while another warned to “stay the hell away from this place.” Some described it as the “sound of darkness,” while others guessed we might be hearing cries from the underworld. “It’s almost like all the sounds (that) ever exist playing at the same time,” Marcos Murudumbay posted on Facebook. “This is some cosmic horror levels of sound,” Kiel Barbosa Turgo said. “The void itself has a voice and we have just heard it,” a YouTube commenter wrote.

5/11/2022,"RODANTHE, N.C. (AP) — Another beach house has fallen into the waves along North Carolina's coast and more are in danger of collapsing, U.S. National Park Service officials said in a statement Tuesday. The unoccupied home that collapsed was located along Ocean Drive in the Outer Banks community of Rodanthe. The park service confirmed the collapse Tuesday and has closed off the area and warned that additional homes in the area may fall too. Debris from the fallen house is spreading widely. Officials from the Cape Hatteras National Seashore, which is part of the park service, said they will be working closely with the homeowner to coordinate cleanup activities. This is the second time a home has fallen into the surf this year. A house in Rodanthe collapsed in February and spread debris across many miles of beaches before the homeowner and volunteers were able to clean most of it up. However, clean up efforts for smaller pieces of debris continues. “Unfortunately, there may be more houses that collapse onto Seashore beaches in the near future,” David Hallac, superintendent of National Parks of Eastern North Carolina, said in a statement. “We proactively reached out to homeowners along Ocean Drive in Rodanthe after the first house collapse and recommended that actions be taken to prevent collapse and impacts to Cape Hatteras National Seashore.” North Carolina’s coast is almost entirely made up of narrow, low-lying barrier islands. Hatteras Island is part of what's known as the Outer Banks. Hundreds of pricey vacation homes have been built there in places where experts say they probably should not have been. The islands are particularly vulnerable to storm surges and to being washed over from both sides. Development only makes the problem worse because communities replenish shorelines that are eroding or have been depleted by storms. As sea levels rise, barrier islands typically move toward the mainland over long periods of time. Holding them in place by artificial means only makes them more vulnerable.",U.S./Associated Press,Another North Carolina beach house falls along the coast,https://news.yahoo.com/another-north-carolina-beach-house-150132348.html
5/11/2022,"An Arizona mom who was allegedly gunned down by an ex-boyfriend she feared was able to call for help just before her shooting death. A 911 dispatcher who answered Maria Guadalupe Godinez Ramirez's call on the night of May 1 heard gunshots over the phone, Apache Junction Police spokesperson Al Bravo told KSAZ-TV. When police arrived in the area of Old West Highway and Colt Road a few minutes later, they discovered Ramirez, 28, gravely injured in her car. “The victim had multiple gunshot wounds and was hospitalized in critical condition,” Bravo said. She later died at the hospital from her injuries, police said in a statement. Her ex-boyfriend, Ulises A. Cruz Peraza, 34, was taken into custody Wednesday in Los Angeles by the U.S. Marshal’s Office, who had been working with Apache Junction detectives. Maria and Peraza had once dated but, in December of 2021, Maria took a restraining order out against him after she “began to fear for her life,” according to the Phoenix news outlet. Oxygen.com reached out to Apache Junction Police but did not get an immediate response. Maria’s brother, Estaban Godinez, said he had been shocked by the shooting. “I never imagined [Peraza] was capable of doing something like this,” he said. “My sister never said much about him to me. Like, 'he’s back' or 'he is harassing me,' or she put any restraints against him. I never knew any of that.” Investigators identified Peraza as a potential suspect in the shooting after allegedly identifying a vehicle seen leaving the scene of the shooting as his, KNXV reports. Those who knew the 28-year-old mother of two held a fundraiser in her honor on Saturday to raise money for her family and increase awareness about domestic violence. “Unfortunately, my little sister will never return home, but she should serve as an example for so many women who are suffering,” Godinez said, according to KPHO-TV. He described his sister as the life of the party, who loved being with friends and family. He said his family is hoping to bury Maria in Mexico, where her mother still lives. He told KPNX that police had told him Peraza has not shown any remorse for his alleged role in the killing. “He needs to stay in jail forever,” he said. “He had no right to take my sister’s life like that.”",U.S./Oxygen,Arizona Mom Allegedly Gunned Down By Her Ex Called 911 For Help Before Her Death,https://news.yahoo.com/arizona-mom-allegedly-gunned-down-185606433.html
5/11/2022,"Republicans, like Gov. Ron DeSantis, want you to know that they believe in the First Amendment, unless you disagree with them. A clear-cut example of this is the Republican response to Disney's concerns about the “Don't Say Gay” law. Disney publicly disagreed with the law and exercised its First Amendment right. For its use of constitutionally protected speech, Disney was financially punished by Florida. An agreement that the state had in place with Disney since 1967 was shredded for political purposes in a matter of days. DeSantis is trying to score political points with the Republican base by attacking “woke” Disney, but his vindictiveness will ultimately fail. The courts will no doubt see his misguided actions as an abuse of power. Abe Lincoln said, “Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."" Florida voters gave DeSantis power, and now we see his true character. Florida is known as a business-friendly state, but when Republican legislators direct their wrath at Disney, the state's largest employer, over a difference of opinion, then we must take Florida being a business-friendly state with a grain of salt.

5/11/2022,"NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France (Reuters) - The Russian military's failure to seize the Ukrainian capital was inevitable because in the preceding years they had never directly faced a powerful enemy, according to a former mercenary with the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group who fought alongside the Russian army. Marat Gabidullin took part in Wagner Group missions on the Kremlin's behalf in Syria and in a previous conflict in Ukraine, before deciding to go public about his experience inside the secretive private military company. He quit the Wagner group in 2019, but several months before Russia launched the invasion on Feb. 24 Gabidullin, 55, said he received a call from a recruiter who invited him to go back to fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. He refused, in part because, he said, he knew Russian forces were not up to the job, even though they trumpeted their arsenal of new weapons and their successes in Syria where they helped President Bashar al-Assad defeat an armed rebellion. ""They were caught completely by surprise that the Ukrainian army resisted so fiercely and that they faced the actual army,"" Gabidullin said about Russia's setbacks in Ukraine. He said people he spoke to on the Russian side had told him they expected to face rag-tag militias when they invaded Ukraine, not well-drilled regular troops. ""I told them: 'Guys, that's a mistake',"" said Gabidullin, who is now in France where he is publishing a book about his experiences fighting with the Wagner Group. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he did not know who Gabidullin was and whether he has ever been a member of private military companies. ""We, the state, the government, the Kremlin can not have anything to do with it,"" he said. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. Gabidullin is part of a small but growing cohort of people in Russia with security backgrounds who have supported President Vladimir Putin's foreign incursions but now say the way the war is being conducted is incompetent. Igor Girkin, who helped lead a pro-Kremlin armed revolt in eastern Ukraine in 2014, has been critical of the way this campaign is being conducted. Alexei Alexandrov, an architect of the 2014 rebellion, told Reuters in March the invasion was a mistake. Gabidullin took part in some of the bloodiest Syrian clashes in Deir al-Zor province, in Ghouta and near the ancient city of Palmyra. He was seriously injured in 2016 when a grenade exploded behind his back during a battle in the mountains near Latakia. Gabidullin spent a week in a coma and three months in a hospital where he had surgeries to remove one of his kidneys and some intestines. Reuters has independently verified he was in the Wagner Group and was in combat in Syria. Wagner Group fighters have been accused by rights groups and the Ukrainian government of committing war crimes in Syria and eastern Ukraine from 2014 onwards. Gabidullin said he had never been involved in such abuses. DIFFERENT PROPOSITION Moscow's involvement helped turn the tide of the Syrian war in favour of al-Assad, but Gabidullin said Russia's military restricted itself mainly to attacks from the air, while relying on Wagner mercenaries and other proxies to do the lion's share of the fighting on the ground. The Russian military's task was easier too. Its opponents — Islamic State and other militias — had no anti-aircraft systems or artillery. Fighting Ukraine, he said, was a different proposition. ""I've seen enough of them in Syria... (The Russian military) didn't take part in combat directly,"" he said in an interview in Paris to promote his book, which will be published by French publishing house Michel Lafon this month. ""The military forces .... when it was needed to learn how to fight, did not learn how to fight for real,"" he said. Wagner Group is an informal entity, with — on paper at least — no offices or staff. The U.S. Treasury Department and the European Union have said the Wagner Group is linked to Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Prigozhin has denied any such links. Concord Management and Consulting, Prigozhin’s main business, did not respond to a request for comment. President Vladimir Putin has said private military contractors have the right to work and pursue their interests anywhere in the world as long as they do not break Russian law. Putin has said the Wagner Group neither represented the Russian state nor was paid by it. Gabidullin said although he had known the Russian invasion of Ukraine was coming, he did not expect it to be on such a scale. ""I could not even think that Russia will wage a war on Ukraine. How could that be? It's impossible,"" he said.

5/11/2022,"A Massachusetts family accidentally brought home a coyote pup they thought was a lost puppy. The family found the young coyote on the side of a road, according to a local wildlife center. The pup is now rehabilitating at the center before being introduced to a foster sibling. A Massachusetts family accidentally brought home a young coyote they confused for a lost puppy, according to the New England Wildlife Center. In a Tuesday Facebook post, the non-profit organization shared a photo of the Eastern coyote pup and described how he was found ""wandering and distressed"" on the side of a busy road. Once the family realized the coyote was not a dog, they reached out to the New England Wildlife Center Cape Branch for help. The organization said it worked with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to determine there was no exposure risk for rabies. A representative for the New England Wildlife Center confirmed with Insider that the Cape Branch received the coyote pup on April 23, and also shared the pup will be rehabilitated at the organization's facility in Barnstable, Massachusetts. According to the Facebook post, he is ""recovering comfortably"" in an isolation ward. The representative also confirmed that a foster sibling for the pup recently arrived from the Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island. The Facebook post said the two pups will be raised together in a large outdoor caging once they both receive their vaccinations. ""We work hard to give them as much of a natural upbringing as possible, and will work to replicate the essential behaviors and skills they learn from mom and dad,"" the post reads. The Wildlife Clinic of Rhode Island did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The New England Wildlife Center's Facebook post noted that although everything worked out for the young pup, the situation could have been a lot different if he had rabies. According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, coyotes are either known as rabies vectors or are considered likely to have the potential to transmit rabies. The wildlife center wrote that if the finders had been scratched, bitten, or had extended contact with the coyote, the pup would have been euthanized and tested for the disease. ""We are grateful to every single person who takes time out of their day to help wildlife when they are [in] need, but we always encourage people to call the appropriate resources prior to intervening,"" the post concluded.

5/11/2022,"Mark Esper, secretary of Defense under former President Trump, appeared Monday on Special Report With Bret Baier, to promote his new book, A Sacred Oath. In the book, Esper details some of the behind-the-scenes happenings that would be shocking had they come from any other administration. For instance, Esper claims that Trump wanted to call up active-duty military to shoot protestors in the summer of 2020. “I said that I would never do anything illegal, immoral or unethical,” Esper said. “But you suggest that you were being asked to,” Baier cut in. “It was being suggested by the president,” Esper replied, “and we successfully pushed back on that. We, being Attorney General Barr, Gen. Milley, myself, and walked him back from that notion.” Trump’s desire to have the military shoot protestors is just one example of his antidemocratic tendencies. Esper went on to cite Trump’s culpability in the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, and his constant lies about the 2020 election as reasons why he now views his former boss as a threat to American democracy. “Do you think Donald Trump was a threat to democracy?” Baier asked. “I think that given the events of Jan. 6, given how he’s undermined the election results, he incited people to come to D.C., stirred them up that morning and failed to call them off,” Esper said, “to me, that threatens our democracy.” “So, yes?” Baier followed up. Esper replied, “What else can you conclude, Bret?” And Esper does not want to see Trump make another run at the presidency in 2024, instead preferring a candidate that will not be so divisive. “So do you think he is going to run for president again?” Baier asked. “I don’t know. I hope he doesn’t,” Esper said. “I hope that the Republican base can figure out that while President Trump pushed a lot of traditional Republican ideas … there are other candidates out there that could run that could do it without dividing the people, without creating such tension within the country, and do it by growing the base as well. I think there are candidates out there that can do that.” Special Report With Bret Baier airs weeknights at 6 p.m. on Fox News Channel.
