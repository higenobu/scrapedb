4/5/2022,"Cancer patients infected with coronavirus in England are becoming seriously ill after they were unable to access antibody or antiviral medicines on the NHS. Ministers have promised to provide early treatment for 1.3 million people whose immune systems mean they are at higher risk of severe disease, hospitalisation or death. The treatments include the monoclonal antibody sotrovimab (Xevudy) and the antiviral medicines nirmatrelvir and ritonavir (Paxlovid), remdesivir (Veklury), and molnupiravir (Lagevrio). However, the Guardian has been told that while many patients are benefiting from the treatments, others are struggling to access them. Some have become critically ill as a result. Health charities say red tape and a lack of clear guidance have led to “mass confusion” and anxiety among some of the most vulnerable people in society. Kate Keightley, the head of support services at Blood Cancer UK, said: “The new treatments are a really important step forward in keeping people with blood cancer safe, and we’ve heard about many people who have accessed them with no problem. But we are hearing from people who are struggling to access them despite clearly being eligible. While it was understandable that there were teething problems when these treatments were rolled out in January, it is deeply disappointing that there are still significant issues with the system three months on. “Every day, we are speaking to people with blood cancer who have got Covid and are scared about what might happen. The last thing they need is the additional stress of chasing the NHS for the treatments, and in many cases anxiously waiting for a call that does not come. “We also know of some people who have run out of time to get the treatments and then gone on to become seriously ill. Particularly with the infection rate so high, the government and the NHS need to urgently focus on this to make sure everyone who is eligible is communicated with and can get access to these treatments.” Phillip Anderson, the head of policy at the MS Society, said: “The government justified their decision to strip 1.3 million people – who are at higher risk of severe illness from Covid – of all safety measures by saying they still have the lifeline of antivirals. The reality is very different, and we’re hearing from people with MS who are getting sent packs of lateral flow tests with absolutely no explanation what they’re for, while others are unaware they can’t use a private test to register for antivirals now. Failing to communicate these vitally important changes to accessing them, and believing their last lot of rushed-out guidance would suffice, has simply led to mass confusion.” Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, said that given the record Covid infection levels, the government should consider expanding the number of people being offered antivirals. “Personally, I think I there is a case for giving antivirals to anyone over 75,” he said. “These are people who are at higher risk of severe disease than younger people, even in the absence of other risk factors.” NHS England said the treatments were available to all eligible patients and tens of thousands had benefited from them. A spokesperson said: “The NHS is continuing to support GPs, NHS 111 and hospitals to make sure eligible patients can access urgent assessments through Covid-19 medicine delivery units, which enable patients to be treated seven days a week.” The Department of Health and Social Care said it had secured more antivirals per capita than any other country in Europe, adding: “Those at highest risk from Covid-19, including people who are immunocompromised, can access antivirals directly and should call NHS 111 or their GP if they haven’t been contacted by the NHS.”",News/Society,Covid patients seriously ill after struggle to access antivirals in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/05/covid-patients-seriously-ill-after-struggling-to-access-antivirals-in-england
4/5/2022,"Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is scheduled to address the UN security council after videos and photos showed streets in the town of Bucha strewn with corpses, some with their hands tied behind their back. The bodies were discovered after Russian troops withdrew from positions around Kyiv as part of what appears to be a refocusing of Russia’s war effort in the south and east. The Kremlin has denied any accusations related to the murder of civilians in Bucha. Satellite imagery of one street from 19 and 21 March appears to show several bodies in exactly the same position as in video footage and photos taken this weekend in the same street. Warning: the following videos contain graphic images of dead bodies that some viewers may find distressing Zelenskiy has warned that the deaths in Bucha could be only the tip of the iceberg, saying he had information that even more people had been killed in places like nearby Borodianka. In other developments on Tuesday, the Red Cross said that Russian forces had released a team sent to help evacuate residents from Mariupol that was detained en route Monday, and Ukraine and Russian-backed separatists traded accusations over an acid tank explosion in Luhansk. In Mykolaiv, officials raised the death toll in the bombing of a bus stop and shopping area on Monday to 11. Under Russian control Russian invasion route Russian airstrike or shelling Russian attack or movement Ukrainian attack or movement  The world becomes increasingly concerned about more than 100,000 Russian troops that have accumulated on the Ukrainian border. Western intelligence agencies sound the alarm, though Vladimir Putin insists Russia has no plans to invade. On 22 February, Putin declared that Russia would recognise the Luhansk and Donetsk regions as independent states, after Russia-backed separatists partially seized the regions. Ukraine and the west's worst fears are realised as airstrikes hit targets across the country, as far west as Lviv. By clicking on the dots on the map, you'll reveal more information about individual strikes and events. Russian forces invade Ukraine from multiple entry points: Belarus to the north, Russia to the east and Russian-occupied Crimea to the south. Russian forces move on several points on the first day of the invasion. Several key locations, including the Chernobyl exclusion zone, are captured by the Russian army. Russian troops enter parts of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, where they face strong resistance. After fierce fighting prevents them from seizing the Hostomel airbase on the first day of the invasion, progress is limited to the north-west of the capital. They are still, however, able to claim some land on the outskirts of the city. Elsewhere, fighting continues even as Russian progress slows. Russian forces move to encircle the southern city of Mariupol, although they enjoy less success in the north, where they abandon an attempt to take Chernihiv after heavy fighting. Russian forces advance on key cities including Kharkiv in the north-east, Kyiv in the north and Mariupol in the south. A large convoy of military vehicles approaches the capital, although progress is limited and logistical problems are reported. As the war enters its second week, Russia steps up shelling of civilian areas. Operations to envelop Kyiv remain the focus of Russia’s efforts, but the ISW reports three other aims: seizing Kharkiv, taking Mariupol and securing a “land bridge” in the south, and securing Kherson in order to set conditions for a drive west towards Mykolaiv and Odesa. Little progress is made over the first two weeks of March. Amid reports of lost momentum and low morale, Russian forces are consolidating positions with reinforcements and probing defences around Kyiv. Dozens of civilians are reportedly killed as Russian forces hit cities with artillery and airstrikes, seen as a new tactic in the face of limited advances on the ground. Russia is widely seen as making its best advances in the south, where Kherson becomes the first major city to fall under Russian control. On the other southern front, several buildings in Mariupol are flattened and people are left without water or power. Russia breaks ceasefires put in place to allow for evacuations from Mariupol and Volnovakha. As the conflict concludes its third week, Russia sends in reinforcements to tighten its grip around the key cities of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Mariupol, which remain under Ukrainian control. Russian advances in the south contrast with difficulties its forces have faced in the north and north-east. Nowhere is this resistance stronger than in the increasingly fortified capital, Kyiv. Russia steps up its artillery and airstrikes on the city in an apparent attempt to degrade defending forces' capacity and morale. It is a strategy that has so far failed in other cities such as Sumy, Kharkiv and Mariupol. In the months before its invasion Russia had deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and latterly Belarus prior to the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures
4/5/2022,"The magizoologist Newt Scamander returns in the latest of the Fantastic Beasts movies, the prequel-saga of the wizarding world in Britain, America and beyond before Harry Potter’s Hogwarts career. JK Rowling co-writes the screenplay with Steve Kloves; Potter veteran David Yates directs with a sure hand; and Eddie Redmayne is looking more eccentric and Dickensian than ever in his role, a Copperfield or even a young Mr Dick with his shock of hair, faintly unfocused gaze, unworldly bowtie and fractionally too-short trousers. The Secrets of Dumbledore is another very amiable and lovely-looking fantasy adventure with some great production design and visual effects, especially in the New York scenes. But it’s not about “secrets” as much as new IP-franchise narrative components shuffled into the ongoing content and shuffled out again. Yet there is certainly something intriguing about the questions arising from the saga’s approach to the existing Potter timeline. Mads Mikkelsen has been brought into the series to replace the now problematic Johnny Depp in the role of Gellert Grindelwald, the evil wizard who once had a close relationship with Albus Dumbledore himself (played by Jude Law with a twinklingly donnish manner and beard). Mikkelsen gives a subtler and more insidious performance than Depp’s, and the “pale eye” effect is more restrained. The movie takes us into the world of 1930s Europe and Weimar Berlin; Grindelwald happens to be in prison and is planning to gain absolute control of the wizarding world when he gets out, by the accepted democratic route if that is convenient. Remind you of anyone? Newt and Grindelwald have each captured a vitally important fantastic beast that will play a key part in the voting process and now Dumbledore is directing a new crew of good guys to tackle Grindelwald’s malevolent strategy, as he prepares to grab control of the wizarding world with a mandate to pursue a hateful war against the non-magic peoples.Jacob Kowalski (played by the excellent Dan Fogler) is the muggle – or in American, no-maj – New York baker, still poignantly in love with Queenie Goldstein (Alison Sudol) who has gone over to the Grindelian dark side for reasons still to be teased out. There is also Newt’s coolly patrician brother Theseus (Callum Turner), as competent and unfazed as a John Buchan character, and Professor Lally Hicks, stylishly played by Jessica Williams, provides the intellectual steel, wizard Yusuf Kama (William Nadylam) will further upset the applecart and Newt’s jolly-hockey-sticks assistant Bunty Broadacre (Victoria Yeates) has a bit of a non-serious crush on our hero. And as the contest begins, we shall find out more about the enigmatic Dumbledore’s personal life and his relationship with the troubled Credence (Ezra Miller). The open secret of Dumbledore’s gay identity is explored further, along with its subsequent effect on the more homophobic older generation; and his relationship with Grindelwald is established in the opening dialogue scene, albeit with a calm, blank sort of emotional restraint. This central relationship seems to be, if not passionless exactly, then certainly a case of emotional pain and rapture being all in the past. There are some great scenes: I loved the Indiana Jones-ish sequence when Newt has to rescue his brother from a dank and horrible cave guarded by a grisly warder, played by the Austrian actor Peter Simonischek (the legendary Toni Erdmann from Maren Ade’s black comedy) and Newt and Theseus both have to do a silly hip-wiggling dance to mesmerise the horrible creatures that infest the place. By invoking fascism and the approaching world war, the film is gesturing at something overwhelmingly evil, and yet by the end you might find the essentially non-committal storytelling style of franchise film-making, with its suspended resolutions, works against this. Then there is the question of the looming Potter world. We may or may not encounter Harry’s parents soon. We meet famous Hogwarts teachers in their youth, although if we assume that Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone was happening around the end of the 20th century, we might pedantically ponder the fact that this would make key teaching staff at that time around 100 years old. Magic preserves youth, clearly. And what of Grindelwald himself? Is he more or less important and evil than Voldemort? Well, surely Rowling has all this mapped out. It’s good-natured entertainment, though there is still something weightless and formless about the narrative.  Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore is released on 7 April in Australia, 8 April in the UK, and 15 April in the US.",Arts/Film,Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore review – good-natured magical entertainment,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/05/fantastic-beasts-the-secrets-of-dumbledore-review-good-natured-magical-entertainment
4/5/2022,"‘My life totally changed in one day,” says Olga Smirnova. “In the morning, I did not know I was going to leave Russia. And in the night, I was sitting on the plane.” The 30-year-old dancer was one of the Bolshoi Ballet’s star ballerinas, a universally lauded performer at the peak of her powers, at a company that has long had close ties to the Kremlin. Earlier this month, she made a shock announcement: she had joined Dutch National Ballet (DNB), leaving Moscow behind. The move came shortly after Smirnova wrote a heartfelt post on the online messaging service Telegram about Russia’s attack on Ukraine. “With all the fibres of my soul I am against the war,” she wrote. “I never thought that I would be ashamed of Russia … But now the line is drawn on the before and after.” Speaking via video call from Amsterdam, she explains her reason for leaving: “It did not feel safe.” Although there had been no direct threat from the authorities, she adds: “I just felt the atmosphere was tense in the country. International flights were being cancelled and there were rumours the borders would be closed, so we decided to leave. We didn’t want to risk it and wait longer.” She knew making such a statement would put her in the spotlight. Why did she do it? “I don’t know,” she says. “I just felt I needed to speak out. I couldn’t keep it inside. There were many artists who spoke out. I admire Russian literature. Dostoevsky and Tolstoy are my favourite writers and you learn from their example that you must speak honestly and openly.” Smirnova barely heard from her Bolshoi colleagues, save for a couple of “supportive and touching” messages. “People are afraid to speak out. If they don’t have any choice but to stay, they prefer not to speak out. Everyone should be able to decide what type of society they want to live in and how much freedom one needs for living.” Appearing to criticise the Russian regime can have consequences. The Bolshoi theatre’s general director Vladimir Urin is among a number of cultural leaders who signed a letter against the war. At a meeting with arts laureates last Friday, Putin suggested merging the directorship of the Bolshoi theatre with St Petersburg’s Mariinsky theatre under its director and Putin loyalist Valery Gergiev, implying that Urin would be ousted. “I never followed politics,” says Smirnova, being careful with her words. “But politics became impossible to ignore, which is why I spoke out against the war. War is an unacceptable way in our civilised world to resolve any conflict.” Besides wanting the war to stop as soon as possible, she worries about the future relationship between Russia and the rest of the world. “It’s really painful,” she says. “Because it’s also about the reputation of the whole Russian people. Russia’s reputation has been severely damaged by the actions of Russia’s government.” Smirnova’s parents are still in Russia. They only knew she had left when the DNB announcement was made. “Only then could I speak to them and explain the situation,” she says. “And, of course, for them it was really hard to accept. First of all, because they are parents and want to have me close. They are upset, they wanted me to stay, but I think they just need more time to accept and understand my decision.” When the invasion began, Smirnova was recovering from an injury, so wasn’t caught up in the busy daily schedule of rehearsals and performances. “It helped to see the situation from outside,” she says. After making the decision, she had five hours to pack her things. She and her husband initially flew to Dubai, then on to Amsterdam where Smirnova started rehearsals the next day. She had always wanted to work internationally: she has loved working with visiting choreographers at the Bolshoi, loves the modernity of the repertoire at DNB, and dreams of dancing ballets by its resident choreographer Hans van Manen. Still, these are not the circumstances she would have chosen. She is already rehearsing for a new production of Raymonda, opening in April. Is she able to concentrate in the studio? Smirnova smiles and visibly relaxes. “It is real happiness to be able to rehearse again,” she says. “In some way, it saves you from the chaos outside. I can say it’s the safest place, where I can be quiet and concentrate. I’m so glad I could rehearse from the first day I was here.” Smirnova plans to stay in Amsterdam for the foreseeable future, having no idea what that future holds. “The company made a warm welcome for me,” she says. “I will try to do my best for them.” Whether she will be able to return to Russia is moot. “To come back to Russia, I think probably I would need to take my words back. And there’s no way I can do that. Of course I would like to see my parents, be able to go to my native St Petersburg. But the future is so uncertain now, both the country’s and my own.”",Arts/Stage,‘I couldn’t keep it inside’: ballet star Olga Smirnova on quitting the Bolshoi and fleeing Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/05/i-couldnt-keep-it-inside-ballet-star-olga-smirnova-on-quitting-the-bolshoi-and-fleeing-russia
4/5/2022,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of attempting to cover up evidence of war crimes. Referring to the recently discovered bodies of civilians in towns surrounding Kyiv, Zelenskiy said Russia is “already launching a false campaign to conceal their guilt” in other areas of the country. Zelenskiy visited Bucha, about 18 miles (30km) north-west of Kyiv, wearing body armour and surrounded by military personnel on Monday. He spoke of the death and destruction in the recently liberated towns of Stoyanka, Irpin and Bucha. “The cities are simply ruined,” he said. The Ukrainian president warned that civilian casualties may be higher in other towns. He was due to address the UN security council later on Tuesday. Sumy Oblast governor, Dmytro Zhyvytsky, has reported that in Konotop district of Sumy Oblast, the Ukrainian military found the bodies of at least three tortured civilians. Without showing any evidence to back their claims, several senior Russian officials have decried the reports of war crimes as fake. Dmitry Medvedev said: “They were concocted for vast amounts of money”, and the speaker of Russia’s lower house of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, said: “The situation in Bucha is a provocation aimed at discrediting Russia. Washington and Brussels are the screenwriters and directors and Kyiv are the actors. There are no facts – just lies.” A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has been released after being stopped during an attempt to reach the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol and held in nearby Manhush. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, has said there will be an attempt to open seven humanitarian corridors today. The routes will be in the Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk regions. The mayor of Kyiv asked European politicians to cut off all commercial ties with Moscow, saying all payments it gave to Russia was “bloody money”. The European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen’s spokesperson has announced that she will travel to Kyiv this week to meet Zelenskiy. She will be accompanied by Josep Borrell, the European Union’s highest ranking diplomat, and they will visit Kyiv ahead of an event in Warsaw in Poland on Saturday. Italy has expelled 30 Russian diplomats because of security concerns. Denmark has expelled 15. Russia has already stated that it will retaliate. France’s European affairs minister Clément Beaune has told RFI radio that the European Union will most likely adopt a new round of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday.

4/5/2022,"Amazon will compete directly with SpaceX and the UK government-owned OneWeb to set up a constellation of broadband-providing satellites, the company has announced. The plan, Project Kuiper, will involve Amazon buying the largest batch of commercial launches in history, securing space on 83 rockets over the next five years to launch 3,236 satellites. “We still have lots of work ahead, but the team has continued to hit milestone after milestone across every aspect of our satellite system,” Dave Limp, the Amazon senior vice-president for devices and services, said. “These launch agreements reflect our incredible commitment and belief in Project Kuiper, and we’re proud to be working with such an impressive lineup of partners to deliver on our mission.” Amazon’s competitors have a long lead time, however. SpaceX has 2,110 satellites in orbit as part of its Starlink broadband network, while OneWeb has launched 428 of a planned 648 in its initial batch. By contrast, Project Kuiper’s first launches will not be until the fourth quarter of this year, when it plans to launch two prototype satellites. Its first full launch does not even have a provisional date yet, with the company waiting for the results of the demonstration mission before setting its plans in stone. As competition among space-based internet companies has blossomed, so too has competition for room on the rockets required to take their satellites to orbit. OneWeb, which is part-owned by the UK state after the Treasury stepped in to rescue the company from bankruptcy in 2020, was forced to delay plans for a launch in March after the war in Ukraine poisoned relationships with the Russian space agency. The company ended up turning to SpaceX for support, signing a deal for an undisclosed amount to put its satellites on the back of its competitor’s rockets. SpaceX itself increased the standard price of a launch by 12% earlier this year, “to account for excessive levels of inflation”, the first such increase in nearly six years. A private launch of the company’s Falcon 9 rocket costs $67m (£51m). The Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, has his own spaceflight company, Blue Origin, but the company will only be providing a portion of the capacity required to put Project Kuiper into orbit. Amazon has signed contracts for 12 launches on Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket, with options for a further 15 more; it has also secured 18 launches on the French Arianespace’s Ariane 6 rocket, 38 launches on the American United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket and the final nine launches from that company’s Atlas V.",News/Technology,Amazon books first rocket launches for broadband satellites project,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/05/amazon-books-83-rocket-launches-for-broadband-satellites-project
4/5/2022,"In 1982, Margaret Thatcher’s Conservative government established Channel 4 in order to create an independent television production sector in the UK. Unlike the BBC or ITV, it was not to make any of its own programmes, not even its flagship Channel 4 News. All over the UK, independent companies sprang up to make its content. In the 40 years since, they have made billions of pounds – not just for themselves but also for Britain, selling their wares around the world. And, unlike the BBC, they have spoken with many voices, bringing diverse and radical ideas to the fore which had barely been heard before in mainstream broadcasting. Yesterday, Boris Johnson’s Conservative government announced it was selling off the channel, claiming that by doing so it would boost independent production companies. This makes no sense. Instead of Channel 4 being a publicly-owned organisation that pumps hundreds of millions of pounds a year into the independent sector, it is being sold off, almost certainly to a giant TV production company, possibly from overseas. It will be in the interests of that company to make as many of its own programmes as it can and retain the rights in them. Many people have never understood Channel 4’s business model, and among them is the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, the minister who announced yesterday that selling off Channel 4 would boost the independent sector. Appearing before the culture select committee last November, she said it was right that the government should evaluate the channel’s long-term financial viability because Channel 4 was in receipt of public funding. She looked embarrassed when the Conservative MP Damian Green pointed out to her that Channel 4 gains its income from advertising, not the public coffers. How can a woman who didn’t even know what organisation’s business model was claim to be motivated by protecting its finances? Of course, as a publicly-owned organisation, Channel 4 also does not make a profit, pumping all its income back into programming, whereas its new owner will rightly expect a profit. The government claims privatisation is needed so Channel 4 can borrow money to compete with Netflix and Amazon. This also shows a misunderstanding both of the purpose of Channel 4 and of the industry. Channel 4 is not there to compete with Netflix and Amazon. It is there to provide public service programming which promotes discussion and debate. I love Bridgerton. I watched the entire first series twice, the second time on mute so I could concentrate solely on the dresses. But I didn’t learn much from Bridgerton about the government’s levelling up agenda. The gorgeous people dancing in those huge ballrooms appeared unaffected by concerns about how to heat them in the energy crisis. One might as well say Netflix and Amazon cannot compete with Channel 4. They have to make content that appeals to a global audience. Channel 4 makes programmes for UK audiences, about the specific concerns and interests of people here. What would be the public benefit in Channel 4 borrowing huge sums to make costume dramas? It won every award going for It’s a Sin. It’s worrying that this government thinks all problems can be solved by borrowing lots of money. We can expect to be reassured that any new buyer will be forced to carry serious programmes such as news and current affairs. But don’t be fooled when the details are announced. Channel 4 News, which is made by the independent company ITN, is one hour long, goes out in primetime and costs a significant amount of money. About a third of its output is international, and it specialises in big, difficult stories such as its investigation into Cambridge Analytica. Will the government say the new buyer must retain that unique news programme? Or will it say merely that a news programme must be carried? Even if the rules state that Channel 4 News must be well-funded and in primetime, how long will it be before any new buyer starts complaining that this is undermining its profits? We have seen that sort of thing happen again and again in privatised companies. And what will happen to important series such as Unreported World, which produce stories and perspectives not seen anywhere else in the UK? The greater the demands placed on the new buyer in terms of provision of high-quality public service programming, the lower the price will be that the government can charge, so it has an interest in restricting requirements. Dorries says a significant portion of the money raised from the sale will go into boosting “creative training”. At present, independent production companies making programmes for Channel 4 provide people with actual jobs, not “creative training”. Channel 4 does, indeed, need to develop new models to sustain its future. The success of All 4, the biggest free streaming service in the UK, is one good example. But it is not an organisation in critical trouble: its programme budget this year is more than £700m for the first time. The sell-off won’t benefit the independent production sector and won’t benefit public service TV. So, who will it benefit? One man in particular will do well out of it: Boris Johnson. Along with the promise to abolish the BBC licence fee, it’s a nice bit of red meat to throw to his rightwing supporters, who are currently unhappy with him. Those two actions together threaten to undermine one of this country’s most successful industries and reduce the level of democratic debate. And speaking of levels, how will it help the government’s levelling up agenda? Currently two-thirds of Channel 4’s main channel content is commissioned from companies in the nations and regions, and 55% of its spend is in new content. Are we to believe the new owners will want to share their profits round the country like that?

4/5/2022,"While the name of the Renewable Energy Foundation (REF) suggests it is a charity dedicated to promoting low-carbon electricity, it appears to spend most of its time campaigning against onshore wind. When it was founded in 2004, with the TV personality Noel Edmonds as its chair, the organisation was clear it wanted to fight against the “grotesque political push” for onshore renewable energy in the UK. It styles itself on its website as “a registered charity promoting sustainable development for the benefit of the public by means of energy conservation and the use of renewable energy”. However, many in the energy sector believe the charity to be full of anti-wind lobbyists. As onshore wind expanded at the beginning of the century, many people felt affronted by what they saw as “eyesores”. It was something many grassroots Conservative party members were angry about, and articles in the Daily Mail and Telegraph frequently complained about a “plague” of windfarms. Some conservationists prefer other forms of renewable energy to onshore wind, which is feared to deplete biodiversity in some areas. The REF was on hand to help with the campaign against onshore renewables, providing research and quotes to the rightwing press. But at the time, others, including the Guardian, questioned the motives of this group. In 2008, the REF had what it described as a “dialogue” with the Charity Commission over whether it was violating its charitable status by being too political in its campaigning. The Charity Commission said it assessed the complaint relating to the REF’s campaigning activities and determined there was no evidence that it was not charitable, but also provided guidance about how to achieve its objectives as an organisation. The REF has strong links to a group accused of climate science scepticism, the Global Warming Policy Foundation, started by the former chancellor Nigel Lawson, who has denied global heating is a problem. Prof Michael Kelly, a trustee of the REF also has a position on the board of the GWPF. John Constable, an adviser to the GWPF, has been quoted as an REF spokesperson and was previously its director of policy and research. Constable answered the Guardian’s questions for this article on behalf of the REF. Since the first onshore wind farm was built in Cornwall in 1991, local groups have formed to fight against the construction of turbines in their area. By 2004, when the REF formed, there were many of these groups. Articles based on the REF’s findings appeared in rightwing papers, helping to sway public opinion against renewable energy. MPs also used briefings from the REF to lobby the government. This seemed to bear fruit. Although in 2011, what was then the Department of Energy and Climate Change said there was a need for onshore wind and that it was a cheap and effective source of renewable energy, the then prime minister David Cameron began to listen to his backbenchers about their distaste for it. In 2015, he said he wanted to rid the countryside of the “unsightly” structures. He did just that. Onshore wind was officially blocked from bidding for financial support available to other forms of renewable energy in 2016, leading to a 94% decline in the number of new projects. It has become very difficult to secure planning permission for renewables, with figures from RenewableUK showing that there are approximately 7,000MW worth of onshore schemes waiting for planning permission. While the REF has been relatively quiet in recent years, growing pressure on the government to support wind energy to help solve the energy crisis seems to have led to it becoming more active again. In recent weeks, the charity has provided anti-onshore wind research to the Telegraph and Daily Mail. Colin Davie, a trustee of the REF, has appeared on Radio 4’s Today programme to oppose onshore wind. Opposition to wind energy has been building in parliament, too. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, last week emphasised that he supported offshore wind, and made no mention of onshore. He is understood to believe that the renewable energy source is unpopular among Conservative MPs. Government sources have briefed that he would prefer to press on with a nuclear energy scheme, aiming for a quarter of the UK’s energy to be supplied by nuclear by 2050. This seems to be out of tune with the public’s thinking. Recent polling for Politico found that 72% of people would support new windfarms in their local area, 52% more permits for oil and gas exploration in the North Sea, and just 38% nuclear power stations in their area. Constable, on behalf of the REF, said: “Our data is often used in planning debates, but we neither make planning applications nor create local opposition groups, so cannot be said to ‘start’ such discussions.” Some Conservative MPs have supported expanding onshore wind. The Thirsk and Malton MP, Kevin Hollinrake, said that now was “the right time” to develop onshore energy “where there is local support”. He continued: “I welcome the government’s decision to hold a new auction for onshore wind and solar. Public opinion has shifted decisively in favour of renewable energy in recent years, with CEN [Conservative Environment Network] polling showing that 74% of Conservative voters back onshore wind.” Environmental campaigners have also been pushing for onshore wind expansion. A Greenpeace UK spokesperson said: “It’s a no-brainer that we should build more onshore wind. It’s the country’s cheapest energy source, one of the quickest to get up and running, and is supported by 80% of the public. Boris Johnson himself has had to rethink his former opposition to wind power and is now considering speeding up the deployment of onshore turbines. With huge public concern about our dependence on fossil fuel imports and skyrocketing bills, any politician actively campaigning against the UK’s cheapest source of homegrown energy has some serious explaining to do to their constituents.” But onshore wind expansion will be unpopular with many Conservatives, including those in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group, which says it accepts the fundamental facts of the climate emergency and the need to reduce emissions, but has been campaigning for more oil exploration, nuclear power and fracking as well as arguing against green subsidies and expansion of renewables. Constable added that the REF had “no blanket policy” on renewables – but that the charity did not see them as a large part of the net zero strategy. He added: “Each proposal must be judged on its own merits, and providing that local environmental concerns offer no obstacle, niche applications may be suitable, as they may be for all renewables.”",News/Environment,Charity linked to UK anti-onshore wind campaigns active again,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/charity-linked-to-uk-anti-onshore-wind-campaigns-active-again-renewable-energy-foundation
4/5/2022,"Ministers have paved the way for a reconsideration of the moratorium on fracking by announcing they have commissioned a study to look at fresh evidence about the controversial practice. In an effort to decrease Britain’s reliance on imported energy given spiralling energy costs – caused partly by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, insisted it was “absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources”. The Conservatives promised in their 2019 manifesto that they would not support shale gas extraction “unless the science shows categorically that it can be done safely”. Some senior Tory MPs have pushed for fracking to be part of the government’s long-delayed energy security strategy, expected to be published on Thursday. The strategy has been mooted to contain more ambitious targets for onshore and offshore wind. Kwarteng suggested it would also explore expanding fracking – a move he has so far appeared to resist. He said on Tuesday that the government would be “guided by the science on shale gas” and that it “remains the case that fracking in England would take years of exploration and development before commercial quantities of gas could be produced for the market, and would certainly have no effect on prices in the near term. However, there will continue to be an ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades as we transition to cheap renewable energy and new nuclear power.” He continued: “In light of Putin’s criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources. However, unless the latest scientific evidence demonstrates that shale gas extraction is safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby, the pause in England will remain in place.” The British Geographical Survey has been asked to investigate if there are any new fracking techniques that scientists believe would be suitable for use in the UK, and how the size of tremors caused by extracting shale gas compares with other forms of underground energy production. The study will also look at whether there are other sites outside those identified in Lancashire that could be at a lower risk of tremors. Fracking is potentially polluting and disruptive to communities and many experts say it would take up to a decade to reap any benefits, and the amount of gas would not make a dent in global prices. Its return appeared to be hampered even more given the lack of support from Tory MPs, revealed by the Guardian. Just five Conservative MPs out of a pool of 138 asked whose constituencies have exploration licences said they supported the measure in their area. A total of 41 said they were against it, while the rest declined to comment or did not reply. Where fracking has been trialled, there has been major local opposition and anger due to earthquakes. Boris Johnson has resisted the permanent closure of two shale gas wells in Lancashire, which were due to be closed on 30 June. Last month Kwarteng said the prime minister had told him it did “not make sense” for the wells to be concreted in.",News/Environment,"Ministers launch UK fracking study, paving way to end moratorium",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/ministers-launch-uk-fracking-study-paving-way-to-end-moratorium
4/5/2022,"The west has frozen more than $350bn (£266bn) of Russia’s $604bn foreign currency reserves, Liz Truss said on Tuesday. Britain’s foreign secretary revealed on the second day of her visit to Warsaw that 60% of Moscow’s reserves were now unavailable to it, slightly higher than recent calculations. It follows US Treasury moves on Monday to make it harder for Russia to pay back its dollar-denominated debt. But Truss, speaking alongside the Polish foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, said the west urgently needed to go further and faster to damage the Russian economy, saying: “The only way to end this war is for Vladimir Putin to lose in Ukraine.” She warned: “Although Russian troops have been defeated in their initial assault on Kyiv, there has been no change in their intent and ambition. We are seeing Putin’s forces set their sights on the east and south of Ukraine, with the same reckless disregard for civilian lives and their nationhood.” Poland is probably the UK’s closest European ally in the war with Ukraine, and on her two-day visit Truss met the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki. On Monday he criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for talking to Putin, saying no one talked to Hitler. Truss has increasingly been setting a high bar for the lifting of the west’s sanctions on Russia, a move that is welcomed in Poland. In the wake of alleged Russian war crimes, the UK has joined Poland and Ukraine in pressing the G7 – including Germany, France and Italy – to set out specific timetables to end their dependency on oil, gas and coal. It is expected that the EU will be willing to take measures on coal and oil but not gas, since the infrastructure is not in place to end the dependency on Russian gas imports. One-third of Russia’s coal exports were sent to OECD Europe. Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey and Poland combined received 24% of all Russia’s coal exports in 2021. Since February the EU has spent €710m (£592m) on Russian coal, €9.6bn on Russian gas and €8.8bn on Russian oil, according to the pressure group Europe Beyond Coal. Truss claimed coordinated sanctions were “pushing the Russian economy back into the Soviet era” and were having a crippling impact on those who feed and fund Putin’s war machine. But speaking before a meeting of EU, G7 and Nato foreign ministers in Brussels this week, she said the west needed to go further by taking four additional steps. These were banning Russian ships from ports, cracking down on Russian banks, “[going] after industries that are filling Putin’s war machine, like gold”, and agreeing a clear timetable to eliminate imports of Russian gas and oil. The US and UK have already barred all transactions with the Russian central bank’s gold reserves, valued at roughly $130bn. The claim by Truss that 60% of Russia’s central bank reserves were beyond its reach shows the success and limits of the west’s sanctions regime. At one level the west can claim progress. For instance, Russia’s central bank announced last week that its foreign currency and gold reserves had fallen since February and the start of the war by $38.8bn, to $604.4bn as of 25 March. On this basis it would take less than a year for Russia to run out of the remaining foreign currency reserves that it can access. But in practice Russia is using funds generated through European purchases of Russian gas funnelled through Gazprombank to generate foreign currency with which to defend the ruble. At the outset of the crisis, in a surprisingly bold move, Japan, the UK, France, Germany and the US all froze Russian assets, making it impossible for Russia to sell the reserves for rubles. But Russia had sought to protect itself by pursuing a policy of building its foreign currency reserves and gold, resulting in it lifting its reserves from $368bn seven years ago to more than $630bn. Figures from 2021 show about 13% of its assets were stored with China, part of a conscious move by Russia to pull its reserves out of the west. Until this week the US had been allowing Russia to use its frozen funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated debt on a case-by-case basis. But on Monday for the first time it prevented Russia from paying for a $552.4m principal payment on a maturing bond, saying it could not access its frozen funds. The Bank of Russia has responded to the west’s sanctions by doubling interest rates to 20% and by demanding unfriendly countries pay for their gas supplies in rubles.",News/Politics,"West must hit Russian economy even harder, says Liz Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/liz-truss-russian-economy-foreign-currency-reserves-ukraine-war-putin
4/5/2022,"My husband of more than 30 years decided to grow his hair long about three years ago. Sex has always been important to us and I have always felt strongly sexually attracted to him. But he is 59, with thin, fine grey hair and, as far as I am concerned, this is not a good look. I’m struggling to maintain our previous spark. Am I just completely shallow and unreasonable to allow a small visual difference get in the way of a previously active and loving intimacy? Perhaps the issue is mine – I’m 51 and menopausal. Do other people experience this when one partner undergoes a significant physical change? Any suggestions on how to manage this would be appreciated; obviously he is his own man and if he likes the way he looks, I can’t change that. We can’t rationalise our way out of well established visual preferences. And perhaps you are someone who happens to be very much visually attuned. Some people respond more to erotic sounds and conversation, while others are turned on by scents and smells. You might want to gently request a change. On the other hand, lowered desire can also be a natural aspect of menopause, and dwindling hormones – rather than long hair – might be the culprit.

4/5/2022,"Shanghai has put all its 26 million residents under lockdown in China’s single-biggest city-wide imposition of the restrictions since the pandemic began as authorities admitted the difficulty in containing the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Until this week, the megacity – also China’s most populous – adopted an approach of phased lockdown. Initially, the eastern side of the Huangpu River went into lockdown between 28 March and 1 April, then the western side followed suit for another four days. But that approach has not worked as case numbers continued to rise. On Monday, the number of new daily positive cases exceeded 10,000 for the first time. Since March, the Shanghai government said, over 73,000 positive cases have been found. These numbers are small compared with countries such as the US and the UK, but they are some of the largest since Covid was first reported in China in late 2019. At least 38,000 medical personnel have been deployed to Shanghai from other parts of China. State media said the operation is the biggest since the Wuhan lockdown in early 2020. “Currently, Shanghai’s epidemic prevention and control is at the most difficult and most critical stage,” said Wu Qianyu, an official at the municipal health commission. “We must adhere to the general policy of dynamic clearance without hesitation, without wavering.” To achieve “dynamic clearance”, the government poured its resource to test all residents in the city on Monday. About 20,000 sample collection points were set up across the city, and 50,000 medics were dispatched to help test the population, state media said. On Monday, authorities announced further restrictions would be placed on transport links. This means more tube lines would be suspended. On Tuesday, 30 main hospitals across the city have suspended their operations, according to the Shanghai municipal health commission website. Yet, as mainland China’s most important financial hub came to a standstill, citizens are complaining about the government’s lack of organisation and preparation. Some residents reported difficulty in ordering food and water online, while others say they were unable to access crucial medical resources when they need them. “I’m not able to buy food. I have nothing left in my fridge. My neighbourhood has been sealed off. I don’t know what to do,” said one resident on Weibo, the social media site. Another wrote: “Our 90-year-old has diabetes. Before the lockdown, our doctor prescribed to us some medication to use at home because all the nurses were asked to help with Covid tests. Suddenly, Pudong was shutdown, and we were unable to get the medication at all. Then we bought it online, but the delivery company was unable to send it to us because they are not delivering anything now.” Over the last few days, numerous mobile phone footage that showed residents protest against confusing lockdown messaging and being unable to buy daily necessities have been circulating online. In one video, several residents in a housing compound shouted: “We want to eat, we want to go to work, we want to have the right to know.” The footage has been taken down by censors. The sense of confusion, chaos and helplessness is overwhelming across a city that until recent weeks was a Covid success story. “[A] lack of communications with the public and psychological preparations still drags an effective response to the pandemic,” said Chen Xi, a public health expert at Yale school of public health. According to China’s present protocols, those who test positive have to be quarantined in a centralised facility. But Chen said given the current situation, the authorities should allow some – for example those infected individuals with no symptoms or light symptoms – to quarantine at home, in order to free up resources.",News/World news,Shanghai puts whole city on lockdown as Covid cases surge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/shanghai-puts-whole-city-on-lockdown-as-covid-cases-surge
