4/30/2022,"A Metropolitan police officer accused of grievous bodily harm after a black man was left paralysed from the chest down has been named after losing a bid to keep his name from the public domain. Imran Mahmood, 35, was charged with grievous bodily harm on 31 March and had sought anonymity from Westminster magistrates court after expressing concern of Jordan Walker-Brown’s alleged links to criminal gangs, according to the PA news agency, which sought submission of the officer’s name alongside other media organisations. Jordan Walker-Brown, 25, was left with life-changing injuries after he was shot with a Taser and fell from a wall in Haringey, north London, while being pursued by police in May 2020. He initially said he believed he was targeted because he is a black man. Dismissing the application for anonymity, the chief magistrate Paul Goldspring described the risk as “speculative” and said it is “a quantum leap from the fact that it can happen, to cogent evidence that such an imminent threat exists in this case”. Goldspring added: “The police habitually manage such risks in the community by a variety of measures, which may well be appropriate in the present case, but anonymity is not justified.” Appearing in court by video, Mahmood of Plaistow, east London, indicated a non-guilty plea in his last court appearance on Thursday. The constable was released on bail and will appear at Southwark crown court on 26 May. Mahmood was charged in March after the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) referred a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. According to official figures, black people are five times more likely to have force used against them by police in England and Wales than white people. Nearly 7,000 Met officers carry Taser stun guns, with numbers expected to rise to 10,000 by 2022. Police said any potential misconduct matters would be considered pending the outcome of the court proceedings.",News/UK news,Met officer accused of paralysing black man loses bid for anonymity,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/met-officer-accused-of-paralysing-black-man-loses-bid-for-anonymity
4/30/2022,"Why are they in this predicament? The injuries which, for much of the season, deprived Leeds of last season’s leading scorer, Patrick Bamford, their England defensive midfielder Kalvin Phillips and their captain and key centre-half, Liam Cooper, fractured the team’s spine, impacting results adversely. Marcelo Bielsa performed wonders at Elland Road but things had started to unravel under the Argentinian this season and his replacement with the impressive Jesse Marsch on 1 March arguably came slightly too late. Although Marsch has praised Bielsa he has suggested that the intensity of his predecessor’s training regime prompted a “myriad of injuries” allied to physical and mental burnout. Moreover Bielsa’s often gung-ho, high-risk, gameplans led to to the concession of an awful lot of goals. How likely do they look to stay up? Leeds nurse a significantly worse goal difference than Burnley and Everton and face the most formidable-looking final fixtures. Conversely they do have the most points in the bag and appear revitalised under Marsch’s tactically and emotionally intelligent leadership. They also possess Raphinha’s right-wing brilliance, have Phillips and Cooper fit again and remain optimistic that Bamford, by far their most incisive striker, will return for at least the two final games. Which players are key to their chances? Bamford: it is no exaggeration to say his reintroduction to attack could be the difference between survival and relegation. Mentions also for Illan Meslier, outstanding in goal this season, Phillips, who offers much-needed midfield control, and Raphinha, on his day an unplayable winger and the creator of so many chances. Louise Taylor Writer’s prediction 20th Norwich, 19th Watford, 18th Everton Remaining fixtures Sat Manchester City (h), 8 May Arsenal (a), 11 May Chelsea (h), 15 May Brighton (h), 22 May Brentford (a) Why are they in this predicament? Sean Dyche’s tried and trusted methods no longer energised the team. The relationship between players and coaching staff had broken down. The former manager was sacked in mid-April, days after a dismal away defeat by the bottom club Norwich, with the team set for the drop after four wins in 30 games. How likely do they look to stay up? Since the departure of Dyche, Burnley have collected seven points in three matches under the stewardship of the caretaker Mike Jackson and his backroom staff, including the captain, Ben Mee. They have looked revitalised, playing a brand of football not witnessed in the past decade; Burnley attack and allow players to express themselves in a manner that would have resulted in a growl from the technical area under Dyche. Which players are key to their chances? The defence has always been steady and remains rigid. In the final third, however, things need to come to life. Dwight McNeil has found form under Jackson and looks to be enjoying his football after a tough spell that has brought him one assist all season. He is looking like the player who burst into the Premier League with his ability to go either way and provide sublime delivery from either flank. Wout Weghorst will be hoping to make the most of this upsurge in productivity from McNeil – the Dutchman has two goals in 15 matches since joining from Wolfsburg in January. Will Unwin Writer’s prediction 20th Norwich, 19th Watford, 18th Everton Remaining fixtures Sat Watford (a), 7 May Aston Villa (h), 15 May Tottenham (a), 19 May Aston Villa (a), 22 May Newcastle (h) Why are they in this predicament? Six years of appalling mismanagement by Farhad Moshiri and the board – that includes, but is not limited to, woeful and extravagant recruitment, a scattergun managerial policy, huge losses and no clear or intelligent football vision – has not only cost Everton their long-coveted chance to close the gap on the Premier League elite but imperilled their 68-year residence in the top flight. To do so having spent about £600m on signings in the Moshiri era – one of the highest outlays in European football in that period – defies belief as well as business logic. After a good start to the season, injuries to several key players sent a mishmash of a team into a tailspin under Rafael Benítez from which they have yet to recover. How likely do they look to stay up? The table, fixture list and Everton’s atrocious away form point towards a first relegation since 1951 yet there are signs that all is not lost under Frank Lampard. There has been no great managerial bounce in terms of results under Lampard, who has won 10 points from 12 league games (the 14 games before he arrived yielded six points), but performance levels at Goodison Park have undoubtedly improved. The three remaining home fixtures, against Chelsea, Brentford and Crystal Palace, are must-wins. Which players are key to their chances? Anthony Gordon has been the one consistent light this season and, given Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s injury problems, Lampard needs more goals and assists from the 21-year-old and from Richarlison. Alex Iwobi has stepped up impressively under the new manager. Andy Hunter Writer’s prediction 20th Norwich, 19th Watford, 18th Burnley Remaining fixtures Sun Chelsea (h), 8 May Leicester (a), 11 May Watford (a), 15 May Brentford (h), 19 May Crystal Palace (h), 22 May Arsenal (a) Why are they in this predicament? A record run of 10 successive home defeats in the Premier League that started after November’s 4-1 thrashing of Manchester United has virtually extinguished any chance of survival, with Roy Hodgson yet to pick up a point at Vicarage Road since succeeding Claudio Ranieri in January. It all looked so different on the first day of the season when Xisco Muñoz’s side saw off Aston Villa 3-0 but the Spaniard went the way of so many of his predecessors despite a decent start and neither Ranieri nor Hodgson has been able to instigate a revival. How likely do they look to stay up? Watford must beat Burnley at home on Saturday to keep alive their faint hopes of avoiding the drop. They then face a trip to Hodgson’s former club Crystal Palace before facing Everton and Leicester at Vicarage Road and cannot afford to slip up in any of those either – especially with a daunting final fixture at Chelsea. Hodgson masterminded Fulham’s great escape at the end of the 2007-08 season with a a run of 12 poin ts from the last five games, including a 3–2 win over Manchester City after being 2–0 down with 20 minutes remaining, so perhaps he has one last trick up his sleeve. Which players are key to their chances? Ismaïla Sarr has struggled to find consistency but the Senegal forward, courted by Manchester United last year, is capable of inspiring match-winning performances, and Emmanuel Dennis looks back in form after a difficult few months. Ed Aarons Prediction 20th Norwich, 19th Watford, 18th Everton Remaining fixtures Sat Burnley (h), 7 May Crystal Palace (a), 11 May Everton (h), 15 May Leicester (h), 22 May Chelsea (a) Why are they in this predicament? Not good enough in either box. That’s the line from both managers this season – Daniel Farke and Dean Smith – although the truth is that they’re not much good in the middle either. A lack of quality and belief has been all too apparent for the vast majority of the season, but a lack of physical capability is the primary failing that has left them unable to compete at this level. How likely do they look to stay up? They could go down this weekend if results go against Norwich at Villa Park and elsewhere. Even if that doesn’t come to pass their demise surely remains inevitable. There is also an issue of increasing disquiet among the fanbase, which is hardly likely to gee anyone up for a shot at a miracle. Which players are key to their chances? Arguably only two players squad have lived up to the challenge this season. Teemu Pukki has 10 Premier League goals, from an average of 1.77 shots per game (82nd in the league and fewer than Marcos Alonso). Not only has he made the most of meagre service, he’s been doing some of the most intensive work off the ball too, conducting 605 defensive pressures, the fifth most in the league according to Fbref.com. The club captain, Grant Hanley, has also delivered. He is third in the league for clearances and eighth for blocks, with the Scot putting himself on the line effectively whenever he has played. The same, sadly, cannot be said for the rest.

4/30/2022,"There is a photo on a boardroom wall at Edgeley Park depicting Stockport’s 1997 League Cup semi-final first leg against Middlesbrough. Almost 12,000 fans packed into the stadium that night to watch second-tier County and it is an image that is helping to inspire their hoped-for return to the Football League. A lot has happened in 25 years but crucially Stockport are four points clear of second-placed Wrexham with a game in hand and could secure promotion over the bank holiday long weekend. But for the more high-profile investment from Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney in north Wales, Stockport might already be popping the corks. The local businessman Mark Stott bought the National League club in January 2020 with the aim of taking them back to the Championship. Covid curtailed his first season and the second ended with defeat in the playoffs but Stockport are close to playing again in League Two, from which they were relegated in 2011. One of Stott’s first appointments was the director of football, Simon Wilson, to help implement an ambitious seven-year plan to reach the Championship. Wilson arrived after spells at Manchester City and Sunderland and a period as a consultant, including providing advice to Stott about purchasing Stockport. “There were natural things you would find with a part-time, underfunded football club,” Wilson says at Stott’s offices in Cheshire. “They didn’t have enough people, they didn’t have the right facilities, couldn’t think further than a week or two in advance so proper planning couldn’t be done. A lot of that comes down to finance – it’s cold and matter of fact. I know Ralf Rangnick has come out with a lot of phrases but I do agree with the three Cs: concept, competence and capital. You need enough of it to start to build things.” Wilson’s links to City helped Stockport, despite interest from Salford City, acquire the Premier League champions’ former training ground at Carrington after Bury were liquidated. Stockport still needed to invest in the facilities because Bury had failed to maintain them, leading to damp and mould in the dressing rooms. “We have often talked about not waiting until the Championship to become a Championship club,” Wilson says. “We wanted to operate like a Championship club from day one and slowly improve the team, and it will also help improve the team by operating at a high level.” The wilderness years saw Stockport drop to National League North for six years and become part-time. There were defeats by Vauxhall Motors, Alfreton and Rushall Olympic as the club struggled to find a way out of a downward spiral. Yet season-ticket numbers never dropped below 1,000, a sign of the potential. Local rivalries were formed against FC United of Manchester and Curzon Ashton in the sixth tier. It was a long way from League Cup semi-finals and beating Manchester City 2-1 in 2002 at Edgeley Park. One of the players that night was Dave Challinor, who returned as manager in November with “unfinished business”. Stockport convinced him to leave Hartlepool in the division above. Challinor’s Hartlepool had defeated Stockport in the playoffs on the way to promotion last season. “It was a really difficult decision because I’d worked so hard to get to the Football League,” says Challinor. “I’d been working for 10 years to get that opportunity and the reality of it was that things were going quite well. Whenever you’re approached about jobs, you’ve always got to look at the present and then quickly make a decision whether it suits you further down the line.” Twenty wins in Challinor’s first 23 league games in charge have taken the team from 10th to first. “I would not have come here if I did not think there was the opportunity to get promoted this year; that would have been daft,” Challinor says in his training-ground office. “I felt there was the opportunity to do that. There was three-quarters of the season to go, still a lot of games and points to play for. If on my first day here I’d been offered a playoff place, I’d have been daft not to take it; if I’d been offered a top-three place, I would have been jumping all over it. The run of wins we put together has given us a really good opportunity to go up as champions. These opportunities don’t come round an awful lot so we need to maximise that and do everything we can to get over the line.” Last November 10,084 were at Edgeley Park to see Stockport dump League One Bolton out of the FA Cup, with an atmosphere reminiscent of 25 years ago. The ground is key to the long-term thinking, with the club acquiring a 250-year lease and planning to expand. Stockport are unapologetic about their spending; the striker Paddy Madden was signed for £250,000 in March 2021 from League One Fleetwood. A first promotion under Stott, Wilson and Challinor would make building the foundations worthwhile. “The potential of the football club is to be a top-end League One club and potentially push back to where it was 20 years ago in the Championship,” says Challinor. “This is the hardest league to get out of. If you carry more funding, momentum, a winning team and mentality into a division where there are three automatic promotion places and playoff spots, there is a good opportunity to kick on and go again. The important thing is getting this bit right and give ourselves the opportunity to do that.”",Sport/Football,Stockport fired by grand ambitions as they push to end painful exile | Will Unwin,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/stockport-push-promotion-football-league-ambitions-championship
4/30/2022,"Who is behind the consortium? The group’s move came when the 86-year-old Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss went public with his interest in buying Chelsea from Roman Abramovich. Wyss said he was working with other investors and it soon transpired that the figure fronting the bid was Todd Boehly, an American who part-owns the LA Dodgers baseball team. Boehly, who co-founded Eldridge Industries, is worth an estimated $4.5bn and his interest in Chelsea has not come out of nowhere: he had a bid rejected by Abramovich in 2019. Nothing has been left to chance this time and Boehly has been chosen as the preferred bidder for Chelsea despite a late bid from Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Investors include Jonathan Goldstein, a British businessman who is the CEO of Cain International and a Tottenham fan, and Boehly’s fellow Dodgers owner Mark Walter. There is also backing from the US investment firm Clearlake Capital. Danny Finkelstein, a Tory peer and Times columnist, and Barbara Charone, a celebrity publicist, will become non-executive directors if the deal goes through. The consortium has received advice from Robey Warshaw, where the former chancellor George Osborne works. It is anticipated that Boehly would be the most influential figure in the running of Chelsea, with Wyss more in the background. Boehly has a long history of working with Goldstein, a lawyer who has been a major player in the property world, and with Walter. What has Boehly done at the Dodgers? It seemed that Stan Kroenke was going to buy the Dodgers for £900m 10 years ago, only for Boehly’s group to stun the Arsenal owner by bidding £1.3bn for the franchise. It was a huge statement of intent and Boehly, who studied at the London School of Economics and is a part-owner of the Los Angeles Sparks women’s basketball team, has since shown plenty of ambition. There has been steady investment in the Dodgers and they claimed the World Series in 2020, which suggests that Boehly would be focused on winning at Chelsea. Are there any potential hitches? The emergence of interest from Ratcliffe throws up the possibility of a late U-turn by Abramovich. No other bidders remain in the running. None of the investors in the Boehly consortium have stakes in rival football clubs and there are no political controversies attached to the bid. Will the approach be different from Abramovich’s? Do not expect Boehly’s group to protect Chelsea’s position by giving them £1.5bn in loans. There is likely to be a desire to make the club self-sufficient and the days of spending £200m on signings in one summer could be over, although that does not necessarily mean that the club will no longer be able to challenge for major honours. They have become one of the biggest brands in the world and could arguably do with a different approach off the pitch. A ruthless culture of hiring and firing managers has been the norm under Abramovich, but the new hierarchy should be looking to build around Thomas Tuchel and give him more control over recruitment. This could be good for the German. Tuchel has enjoyed working with the influential director Marina Granovskaia and the technical and performance adviser, Petr Cech, who should stay, but change in the boardroom could make him even more powerful. Are there plans to renovate Stamford Bridge? This will be key to boosting Chelsea’s finances. Stamford Bridge has a 42,000 capacity and is smaller than Arsenal’s, Tottenham’s and West Ham’s grounds. A stand-by-stand renovation is one possible solution. Moving would be fraught with difficulties beacuse the freehold is held by the non-profit plc, Chelsea Pitch Owners (CPO). Will there be supporter engagement? All bidders have had to engage in dialogue with the CPO and the Chelsea Supporters’ Trust, but it remains to be seen if there will be a golden share for fans. What issues need to be resolved? The new owners will need to provide Tuchel with funds to the plug the gaps in his defence. Antonio Rüdiger has decided to join Real Madrid on a free and Barcelona are expected to sign Andreas Christensen when the Denmark centre-back’s contract expires at the end of the season. Barça also retain an interest in César Azpilicueta, who could be allowed to leave despite Chelsea triggering an automatic one-year extension in their captain’s deal. The upheaval could leave Tuchel with Thiago Silva, Malang Sarr and Trevoh Chalobah as his only senior centre-backs. Levi Colwill could step up after a fine loan at Huddersfield but more experience is required. Are there problems in other positions? The owners will need to get to work quickly. They must start negotiations with Mason Mount, whose deal runs out in two years, and consider whether alterations are required in midfield. Decisions will need to be made over N’Golo Kanté and Jorginho, with both midfielders out of contract next year. Is now the time to sell one of them given that Conor Gallagher is returning from his loan at Crystal Palace? As for the attack, Chelsea must also decide whether to cut their losses on Romelu Lukaku. The striker has not settled since his £97.5m move from Internazionale last summer and does not appear to suit Tuchel’s style. Will they be active in the transfer market? Chelsea will need to replace Christensen and Rüdiger, and are likely to revive their interest in Sevilla’s Jules Koundé. Leicester’s Wesley Fofana and RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol are also being monitored, and Atlético Madrid’s José Giménez has been targeted in the past. There is an opportunity to freshen up the squad. West Ham’s Declan Rice remains a target in midfield, though Monaco’s Aurelien Tchouameni would be easier to buy. Similarly the Lille forward Jonathan David could be more affordable than Benfica’s Darwin Núñez, although incomings in attack could depend on sales. There are doubts over Lukaku, Christian Pulisic, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech.",Sport/Football,Who are Chelsea’s prospective new owners and what issues do they face?,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/who-are-chelsea-prospective-new-owners-boehly-and-what-issues-do-they-face-abramovich
4/30/2022,"The number of children in the UK suffering from severe hepatitis has risen to 145 as concerns mount about the mysterious surge in cases. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) announced an increase of 34 cases but said most children have recovered and no children have died. There has been no increase from the 10 children who have required a liver transplant, reported on Monday. Scientists believe there could be a link to adenovirus infection, which has been detected in the majority of cases, but are continuing to investigate the cause. Hepatitis is not a common side-effect from adenovirus, which typically causes cold-like symptoms and nausea, so scientists are investigating whether a co-infection, including with Covid-19, or non-infectious causes such as food poisoning, drug or metal exposure, could be playing a role. “We are also exploring whether increased susceptibility due to reduced exposure during the Covid pandemic could be playing a role, or if there has been a change in the genome of the adenovirus,” UKHSA said in a statement. Dr Meera Chand, the agency’s director of clinical and emerging infections, said: “We know that this may be a concerning time for parents of young children. The likelihood of your child developing hepatitis is extremely low. However, we continue to remind parents to be alert to the signs of hepatitis – particularly jaundice, which is easiest to spot as a yellow tinge in the whites of the eyes – and contact your doctor if you are concerned.” Prof Deirdre Kelly, a paediatric hepatologist at Birmingham Women’s and Children’s NHS trust and part of a group working with UKHSA to investigate the cases, said that the surge seemed likely to be related to the pandemic and that the group had found a medical report from 1924 describing an increase in child hepatitis after the 1918 influenza pandemic. “They also had a surge in hepatitis, which is fascinating,” Kelly said. She added that the far higher numbers of cases seen in the UK compared with Europe was likely to be due to a better reporting system. The UK has centralised liver treatment centres, meaning that milder cases could be picked up quickly. Chand advised parents to ensure that children follow normal hygiene measures including thorough handwashing. “As always, children experiencing symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea should stay at home and not return to school or nursery until 48 hours after the symptoms have stopped,” she said.",News/Society,Number of UK children suffering from hepatitis rises to 145 ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/29/number-of-uk-children-suffering-from-hepatitis-rises-to-145
4/30/2022,"A former police officer who had sex with vulnerable women and pursued inappropriate relationships after meeting them in the course of his duties has been jailed for three years. Oliver Perry-Smith was described as a “sexual predator” who “abused his power” and “broke public trust” by pursuing female members of the public for sex while at Thames Valley police. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) watchdog began an investigation in November 2019 and found that Perry-Smith had a case to answer for gross misconduct. The IOPC said the officer pursued six women between September 2014 and November 2019 whom he had met through his duties. The 38-year-old, who joined Thames Valley police in 2009 and passed its exam to become a sergeant, had sexual contact with three and tried to establish sexual contact with the others, the watchdog said. He looked up the details of one of those women, and a seventh woman, on the force’s computer systems for no policing purpose while based at Newbury police station, the IOPC added. The watchdog ruled that the women had all been in vulnerable positions, either because they were subject to a police complaint requiring investigation or else were victims, witnesses or acting as appropriate adults for young victims of crime. His actions were uncovered in 2019 when a woman called police after Perry-Smith, who had previously attended the home of her friend, then texted her an indecent image. The watchdog found that the officer had also looked up details for her and her family on the police computer system. On another occasion he used a police computer to identify a woman using her car registration after parking next to her and watching her go into a shop, the IOPC said. Perry-Smith, from Newbury, subsequently called at her home without a policing purpose and made personal comments about her appearance, despite knowing she was alone with a young child, the watchdog said. The woman became suspicious and made a complaint to the IOPC. The former PC pleaded guilty to three charges of misconduct in public office, and two charges of unauthorised access to computer material, contrary to the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Perry-Smith, who resigned from Thames Valley police on 8 February this year, was sentenced at Reading crown court to three years and six months in prison. IOPC regional director Graham Beesley said: “Perry-Smith was a sexual predator and his conduct caused significant distress to the women involved. He was prolific in the abuse of his position over a five-year period and his acts were intentional, deliberate, targeted and planned. “His actions were often at the expense of his formal policing duties.” Beesley said Perry-Smith’s actions had “seriously undermined the good work of the large majority of police officers who professionally serve the public on a daily basis”. The IOPC said he would also be placed on the barred list, preventing future employment within the police service. Senior crown prosecutor Charles White, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said Perry-Smith had taken “advantage of his privileged position and access to police resources to pursue several women over a few years”. He said: “He knowingly breached police policy when he made personal visits while on duty. He seemed to think that by lying to his superiors and using his duties as an excuse, he’d be immune to the consequences of his actions. “Today’s sentence proves no one is above the law, including those meant to uphold it. Perry-Smith abused his power, broke public trust, and made many women feel uncomfortable or unsafe in his inappropriate pursuit of them.” Information and support for anyone affected by sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.
