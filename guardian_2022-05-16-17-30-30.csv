5/16/2022,"Scott Morrison’s sales pitch on the Coalition’s housing policy was thrown off course on Monday by a minister’s admission about its potential to cause a “bump” in house prices. Anthony Albanese focused on health while trying to hold the line on “polite incentives” during press conferences. Here’s how the final Monday before the 21 May election unfolded. By Paul Karp Scott Morrison started Monday in Brisbane with a barrage of interviews selling the Coalition’s policy allowing first home buyers to access their superannuation. On Nova radio in Perth, he faced a grilling about why he is so mean about Anthony Albanese gaffes and lack of action on climate change, but he got a friendlier run on Kyle and Jackie O. In his first stop in the Labor-held Queensland marginal seat of Blair, Morrison surveyed plans for the Springfield Rise development with LNP candidate Sam Biggins. Biggins suggested journalists would shortly meet some first-home buyers, but they remained inside for the press conference, chatting only briefly to Morrison in front of the cameras. That meant the press conference was short and sharp – and Morrison didn’t answer multiple questions about economic analysis and modelling about his policy’s impact on housing prices. The second stop in Blair was a cafe in Ipswich, where Morrison announced $1m for the Riley Valley football club to help build a club house; and $2.5m for a business case for the Ipswich central second river crossing. Blair is held by Labor on just 1.2%, and is in play if a tough ask for the Coalition given the high water mark at the last election. At the top of Labor’s target list in Queensland are Brisbane and Ryan, two inner-city seats where Morrison is out of favour, and Longman. One suspects the Blair stop is as much about staying out of areas where the PM’s presence is a vote loser as it is about generating images from a shiny new housing estate. Morrison then made a flying visit to Cairns to support Liberal for Leichhardt, Warren Entsch. Because the Association of Independent Retirees division meets in the Cairns District Darts Association hall, Morrison perhaps thinking it was a sporting club, asking a pair of retirees if they were members of the club and “how’s their aim”.

After a short Triple M radio interview chock-full of sports metaphors, he headed to the Bentley hospital to join premier Mark McGowan to announce a $150m joint investment with the WA government for a surgery facility upgrade. It’s in the electorate of Swan. WA’s “state daddy” turned heads when he arrived: one woman in the hospital carpark exclaimed, “Oh my god it’s Mark McGowan” to her daughter as they walked past. Albanese didn’t quite have the same instant recognition in Perth: one young woman asked, “Who are you?” as the federal Labor leader got out of his car. Albanese’s recently-adopted press conference rule of ignoring questions from the louder journalists is starting to annoy reporters on the bus. He joked it was a “politeness incentive”. It’s working for him, taking some of the heat out of press conferences which recently have been combative. We should note Scott Morrison hasn’t instituted such a rule. After meeting a nurse and a patient outside the hospital for a quick chat, Albanese then rushed off to an early learning centre in Hasluck. In the whistle-stop visit, barely lasting 15 minutes, the Labor leader helped one infant with a colour and shape matching game, dodged sand chucked by an overly enthusiastic digger in the sandpit, and threw a ball back and forth. Despite receiving joking pleas for Albanese to run along a balance beam or dig a hole himself, his advisors - mindful to the obvious political metaphor opportunities in the media pack - declined. Then it was off to a pre-poll centre in Pearce, to rev up Labor volunteers handing out how to vote cards. Liberal senator Ben Small and Labor’s Sue Lines flew the flags for their respective parties, with the ALP candidate for Pearce, Tracey Roberts, on hand to meet voters she hopes to represent after Saturday. At the pre-poll booth between a smoke shop and a deli in an outdoor bank of shops, Albanese made a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it visit to meet with volunteers. Large billboard trucks circled the area - some blaring anti-Liberal slogans, others for Clive Palmer’s UAP, while the Labor leader got snapped with an LED “it won’t be easy under Albanese” banner in the background. Shaking hands and patting the obligatory dog, he said hello and then goodbye, disappearing around the corner as quickly as he came. Property prices: The Coalition’s twin-pronged housing policy is likely to push up property prices to the benefit of existing homeowners, with only modest effects on increasing supply, market analysts say. The superannuation minister, Jane Hume, told ABC Radio National there would likely be “a bump in house prices” in the short term, as “a lot of people bring forward their decision to buy a house”. Here’s an explainer about the policy details. Aukus snub: Anthony Albanese has accused the government of “playing politics” with national security after revelations it kept Labor in the dark about the Aukus agreement despite Washington’s desire for bipartisan support. The Nine newspapers reported at the weekend that Labor was only briefed about the Aukus security partnership the day before it was made public last September, despite the US making clear in negotiations that it wanted enduring bipartisan backing for the deal given it would be a decades-long endeavour. Scott Morrison defended the Coalition’s handling of negotiations, saying he wasn’t going to risk sharing the details with Labor until the deal was finalised. He noted that ultimately the agreement had secured bipartisan support. Balance-of-power wishlist: The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, will release a $173bn balance-of-power wishlist at the party’s campaign launch in Brisbane on Monday night, outlining seven key concessions it wants from Labor in the event of a minority government. I agree with our policy. – The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, makes a startling admission when asked about an analyst’s comments on housing policies. Sleeps to go until election day. All that super to use... pic.twitter.com/1lkxz3v9Pn When you’re racing around the country, the campaign can be a bit of a blur. Members of the existing crossbench were asked during a National Press Club debate today whether they would work with a future Morrison-led minority government.

5/16/2022,"The exceptional heatwave conditions across parts of India and Pakistan over the past few weeks have been in the news – although the region has in fact endured extreme heat since March. Through the next few days, although nowhere near as extreme as in India and Pakistan, anomalous warmth will be affecting large portions of western Europe in the first significant heat of spring. Throughout April, large parts of Europe experienced below-normal temperature trends, with winds often emanating from a north-easterly direction. However, over the past week or so, weather patterns have rearranged to encourage more of a south or south-westerly feed of air across Europe, and temperatures have been picking up as a result. Through the coming week, as a southerly flow continues, temperatures across much of western Europe will increase further, such that maximum daily temperatures relative to average will be among some of the highest in the world at this time. Through much of Spain and France, daytime highs are likely to rise into the mid-30s celsius this week, representing anomalies in excess of 10C above normal. Later this week and into the weekend, it looks likely that parts of Iberia and northern Africa will become even hotter still, with some forecast models hinting that maximum daytime temperatures may break 40C in parts of central and southern Spain. While not record-breaking at this stage, these would still represent temperatures about 10 to 12 degrees above the seasonal norm. The heat has already been generating thunderstorm activity, some of which has spilled northwards into the UK at times. Meanwhile across the other side of the globe, devastating floods have continued to affect parts of Queensland in Australia, forcing people from their homes. While the heavy rains responsible for the flooding have eased over the past week, river levels have continued to rise, peaking in the last few days. It looks likely that south-easterly winds will drive in more unwelcome rain to coastal Queensland later this week, with totals exceeding 100mph possible by the end of this weekend. It is also looking windy and extremely wet across north-western portions of western Australia too this week, with 100 to 150mm of rain expected in the next few days, leading to a flood risk in these areas.",News/Environment,Unusually high temperatures to hit western Europe this week,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/unusually-high-temperatures-to-hit-western-europe-this-week
5/16/2022,"Under sunny blue skies and as a cool breeze blew off Lake Erie, the Buffalo East Side district of Kingsley was both transformed by a determined resilience from a day earlier, when 10 people were shot dead by an 18-year-old white supremacist, and still full of anger as people continued to mourn. There was an outpouring of grief, coupled with fear, from residents gathered on one side of Tops Friendly, the grocery store where the killings happened, and which was now roped off as a crime scene. But on the other side those emotions were matched by prayer vigils, gospel songs and strength derived from faith. Between the two, residents of the neighborhood came together as, for now, a community that was still only beginning to negotiate what had happened to it when the white gunman had so brutally attacked them. Some saw the roots of the violence against the Black community in a profound mis-telling of history in America and a deep-rooted prejudice against it that was still echoing on through everyday existence. After all, one analysis from the University of Michigan found the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metro region was America’s sixth most segregated. Meanwhile, a 2021 University at Buffalo report found measures of health, housing, income and education had improved little for Black residents in the city and in some cases had declined over the past three decades. “We want deep history to be taught, for the truth be told, and all of this racism to stop,” said jazz promoter Denise McMichael-Houston. Her cousin, Ellen Lucas, an educator in the city, said: “The problem is that they will not teach accurate history in schools. I have lived in this city 72 years and everything here is racist. We have this one supermarket.” Lucas said that 24 hours after the assault, her mother was still vomiting at home from being so upset and unable to leave the house. Asked how a tragic event like this – one of a series of racist mass killings in America in recent times – could be turned toward hope, Lucas said: “History taught correctly, tell history the way it happened. We were brought here as slaves, white people enslaved us because we are Black and nothing else. We need to know our contributions, and that would change how we look at ourselves. “If I go in a restaurant, the first thing I have to do is make white people feel comfortable, grinning and smiling, and be who I’m not.” On this side of the supermarket, anger was palpable. On the other, where the religious and spiritual leaders had set up, less so. Rev Rita Anderson-Bailey, who runs the counseling service Renovated Soul Marriage and Family Therapy, offered a parallel approach to the understandable rage. “There’s a place for anger, and for peace and calm. When we don’t have answers, we have to rely on faith to help us cope. That’s been for generations,” she said. “The anger part of it is when we start to hold our leaders accountable.” But others said they would simply prefer to leave the area. At a nearby Family Dollar, 18-year-old clerk Nonni Walker, a community college student, said she’d been due to work a shift but her intuition told her not to come. “There’s so much crazy. So it’s wait for the next crazy and pray that you’re safe during it.” For her generation, she said, the solution was “not to be anywhere near here”. And then there’s the question of the supermarket, the only Black-run grocery of its kind in that Buffalo neighborhood. Without it, the neighborhood would again be deprived of groceries. Some said it should be turned into a memorial. Then there is the issue of gentrification, which has been nibbling at the edge of neighborhood with the displacement and disruption that the process involves. “If you raise up the property values, you create fear for people who don’t want to come back to their own community and they leave,” said local activist Shango Oya. “What would improve the neighborhood is real economic redistribution and holding political power accountable for the money they’re spending.” Hours earlier, New York state governor Kathy Hochul had visited the area and urged social media platforms to crack down on content concerning white supremacy. She said she found it inexcusable that the assailant’s graphic live stream wasn’t taken down “within a second”. The attack, said 27-year-old Tone Arrington, would forever teach her to speak up. “I personally will never sit back and hold my mouth shut. I want people to see what really happens in our world and our community.” Nearby, an eight-year-girl had just stilled onlookers by singing a complete gospel song. “That shows you what she’s being taught at home,” Arrington said. “And then we have this 18-year-old coming in here and shooting all these people, and that goes to show what he was taught at home, and what he was taught to believe, and what his parents instilled in him. Hear what I’m saying? It doesn’t add up.”",News/US news,‘Everything here is racist’: Buffalo shooting neighborhood ponders reasons for the violence,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/everything-here-is-racist-buffalo-shooting-neighborhood-ponders-reasons-for-the-violence
5/16/2022,"While petrol price rises may have made the headlines, the energy crisis has also been hitting owners of electric cars in the pocket. The cost of charging at home has risen by 43% for some drivers, while the already higher cost of on-the-road recharges has gone up 25%. As energy prices are forced up due to rising costs for suppliers, specialist charging deals for drivers have become more scarce. And now there are suggestions that people may put off the purchase of an electric car as the cost-of-living crisis takes hold. Although demand for vehicles is high, a new report to be released this week from Volkswagen Financial Services suggests that fewer people might commit to buying electric vehicles (EVs) as belts tighten and the cost of energy increases. “The cost-of-living squeeze will probably mean some potential EV purchasers may not commit to a switch this year, particularly as such vehicles are perceived to be more expensive in relative terms when compared to combustion engine alternatives,” says the report. Electric car owners who are charging their vehicle at home will usually find the most cost-efficient option is one of the specialist tariffs on offer. “Two-rate” tariffs offer one price for electricity used during the day and another for night-time use. When prices are much lower you can top up your battery cheaply. For example, comparison site Love My EV lists the rates for EDF’s GoElectric 35 as 44.69p per kilowatt hour (p/kWh) during the day and 4.5p/kWh at night. The Octopus Go tariff costs 35.04p/kWh during the day and 7.5p/kWh at night. Both figures are based on supplying a home in south Wales. Since energy prices have increased, the number of specialist deals on the market has dropped, says Laura Thomson, co-founder of Love My EV. While they are usually the best deals for drivers who charge overnight, the day rate and standing charge can be expensive, which consumers need to take into account when working out what is best for their situation. “For most people who have an EV to charge at home, it does make sense, but there is a high standing charge and a high day rate to factor in,” says Thomson. If you use a lot of electricity during the day, this may not be your best option. The site has a comparison tool for tariffs. Beware of promises of “free miles” within tariffs as these savings may be outweighed by higher charges, it says. The rising price of EV tariffs means drivers now face paying 43% more than a year ago. This amounts to a rise of about £75 a year for an average vehicle such as a Nissan Leaf or a Renault Zoe, says Ben Nelmes of transport research company New AutoMotive. In 2021, the cost of recharging an EV that covered 7,400 miles a year – the average mileage – and was recharged mostly at night was £174. This was based on an overnight rate of 4p/kWh and a day rate of 18p/kWh. By last month, this same charging practice cost £249 a year, based on the best prices then available – 5p/kWh at night and 28p/kWh during the day. “Someone driving a bigger EV, such as a Kia e-Niro or Tesla, will find that this underestimates what they’ll be paying. Similarly, someone in a Smart car will find they spend a bit less than this,” says Nelmes. Rising costs have also become apparent at public chargers. Instavolt, which operates a charging network across Britain, has increased its prices twice so far this year, first from 45p/kWh to 50p/kWh and then to 57p/kWh. Ubitricity, one of London’s largest charging networks, increased prices from 24p/kWh to 32p/kWh last month. Data company Zap Map, which maps public charge points, found that, on average, charging costs increased from 24p/kWh in December to 30p/kWh in February for slow and fast chargers, and from 35p/kWh to 44p/kWh for rapid and ultra-rapid chargers. “The price of charging your EV on the public network, or at home, has risen substantially over the past few months with the general increase in electricity prices,” says Melanie Shufflebotham from Zap Map. There are 460,000 EVs currently in the UK, according to the Volkswagen Financial Service report, and just 300,000 home charger points installed. Those who don’t have a home charger end up paying more, according to Keith Brown of Paythru, a payments technology company. “One of the big inequities of the emerging EV charging market is the price ‘premium’ electric vehicle drivers pay if they don’t or can’t have a home charge point,” he says. “Domestic supply is taxed at a VAT rate of 5% whereas public charge-point supply is taxed at a VAT rate of 20%.” Shufflebotham has called for the rates to be made equal. “Equalising the VAT rate for both public and home charging would be a great example of levelling up, and encourage more people to make the transition to electric vehicles,” she says. Despite increasing prices, EV drivers still face much lower bills than those with petrol or diesel cars, using figures based on the same annual mileage for all types of vehicle. Nelmes says that while the rises in the costs of EV charging at home are high, they are dwarfed by the costs of filling a car with fuel. “We estimate the average UK motorist would spend £1,028 per year on petrol and £987 per year on diesel. That’s up from £796 a year on petrol and £747 a year on diesel a year ago,” he says. “That means that the fuel cost savings available to petrol and diesel drivers who switch to EVs this year are £779 for petrol drivers and £738 for diesel drivers.” Having bought a Nissan Leaf in the last few weeks, Philip Ingram looks back at the deals that were available last year with some annoyance. He currently pays a flat rate throughout the day of 28.45p/kWh with British Gas, the best tariff available to him at home in Bordon, Hampshire. Last year, he could have taken advantage of deals of 5p/kWh overnight, he says. While there are deals with good night-time rates, now their high day rates mean they do not suit the family budget. The annoyance is tempered by the savings from moving from a diesel VW Golf to an EV. Ingram, who runs a cotton company called LittleLeaf Organic, used to pay nearly £90 to fill up with diesel but gets the same mileage for £20 of charging. This has to be balanced against the cost of the car: £24,000. “I wish we had done it a long time ago,” he says, “but the reason that we have been slower is … capital costs. Several times I have said to [my wife] Lisa the running costs are unbelievable, but then you look at the cost of buying this car, [which] is enormous.”",News/Environment,Brace for a shock: cost-of-living crisis drives up price of electric car charging,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/16/brace-for-a-shock-cost-of-living-crisis-drives-up-price-of-electric-car-charging
5/16/2022,"When I transitioned from male to female 20 years ago, I experienced numerous differences in how others viewed and treated me. But the most dramatic disparity was that, as soon as the world began perceiving me as female, I began receiving an exorbitant amount of unwanted attention. Much of this took the form of “street remarks”, when strange men hurl random comments or provocations at women in public settings, often under the veneer of sexual attraction or appreciation. I say “veneer” because these incidents may superficially seem like expressions of sexual interest, but research into this phenomenon, as well as my own personal experiences, indicate that there is far more going on than that. It is impossible to understand street harassment without first recognizing that it violates two well-established societal norms. First, there are well-accepted customs for how, when and where to express romantic or sexual interest. Often this occurs in particular social spaces (dating websites or apps, certain bars, clubs, parties or events) where people purposely congregate in the hopes of meeting potential partners. Upon meeting someone new, there is usually some kind of “getting to know one another” phase, where we attempt to gauge (from body language, enthusiasm, etc) whether there may be mutual interest. The very fact that such settings and etiquette exist implies that, in other situations, it is inappropriate to sexually proposition people. So when a man makes a sexually explicit comment or proposition to a woman who is walking down the street, both parties should understand that such remarks are inappropriate, if not completely out of order. The second violation, which sociologist Carol Brooks Gardner has chronicled in her research into street harassment, is that it is generally considered to be a breach of social protocol to disturb or impose upon people with whom we are not already acquainted. This is why, if we ask a stranger for directions, or even alert them that they’ve accidentally dropped something, we usually begin with an apology: “Excuse me, sorry to bother you, but …” As children, we are generally taught not to talk to strangers or to stare at other people. And I know that most people are capable of following these norms because that is what I experienced as an adult before my transition. When I moved through the world as male, it was extremely rare for anyone to attempt to speak to me or garner my attention. But upon being perceived as female, I felt bombarded by such interruptions. Perhaps because street harassers recognize that their actions defy these social norms, they will often justify their remarks as being either innocent compliments, or else sincere expressions of sexual interest. If this were true, then one might expect such comments to be wholly positive or flattering, but that hasn’t been my experience. The street remarks I have received run a gamut that might be described as “the good, the bad, and the ugly”. The “good” here refers to remarks that on the surface appear to be complimentary, although they were often highly specific evaluations of my body or appearance that veered into the realm of invasiveness. The “bad” refers to remarks that also evaluated my body or appearance, albeit negatively (“you should smile more”, “you’d be prettier with makeup”). The “ugly” refers to outright sexually explicit comments, often involving graphic descriptions of what the harasser wanted to do to my body. On a few occasions, they have been accompanied by attempts to touch or grope me. If the supposedly “good” remarks were sincere compliments, then you might expect that they would be reserved for the most conventionally attractive women out there. But this does not appear to be the case either. I don’t think anyone would have ever described me as a “head turner”, yet I received remarks relentlessly. In fact, in going through the diary that I kept from my transition, I found one passage from a day when I was less than two months into hormone therapy and still dressed in “boy mode,” and yet I was “hey baby”-ed three different times within a span of eight city blocks. This was well before I developed a feminine figure, so I highly doubt that this street harassment had anything to do with these men finding me attractive. Rather, this seemed to be predicated primarily, if not solely, on the fact that I was simply a young woman out in public. Feminist theorizing of street harassment has tended to frame the matter in terms of sexual objectification – that is, these men viewed me as little more than an object for them to sexually evaluate, appreciate and potentially use. I believe that sexual objectification is playing a role in many of these instances, but not all of them. For example, there was the time I was standing at an empty table at my local post office organizing packages when, out of nowhere, a middle-aged man came up next to me and said, “Don’t work yourself too hard, sweetie,” then walked away. Or the time I bought tickets to a tour while on vacation, and the thirtysomething guy behind the cash register briefly acted as though I hadn’t paid him already: “What tickets?” he said with an obnoxious smile, as if he was playing some variation of the childhood game “I’ve got your nose” with an adult woman. Perhaps the most infuriating aspect of all this was that, even though the aforementioned incidents clearly violated widely accepted social rules, my harassers expected me to simply accommodate these intrusions, preferably with a smile. If, however, I were to protest or challenge, or even ignore, these intrusions, my harassers would usually act as though I was the one who was acting “out of order”. For instance, if I pretended not to hear their remarks, they would often call me “rude” “cold” or a “snob”. Or if I became angry, they would complain that I was “overreacting”. When I first experienced these sorts of responses, I honestly thought they were also a part of the ruse. Surely these men knew they were misbehaving, and they were feigning offense to further mess with me. But after numerous confrontations, and sometimes even discussions – yes, I am that nerd who occasionally performed impromptu ethnomethodological analyses on my street harassers – I came to the conclusion that they generally did not view their own behavior as out of order in any way, and they sincerely did believe that I was the “bad actor” in the situation. Here’s how I have come to make sense of this reversal of standard social rules: my harassers acted as though I had invited their attention, when in fact I had done nothing of the sort. I’ll refer to these as phantom invitations, as they existed solely in the minds of the people who perceived me, not in my own actions. Normally, if an individual invades your personal space, most people would agree that the individual has behaved inappropriately, and that you are warranted in calling them out. But because I was perceived as “inviting” these men’s attention (due to the fact that I was a woman out in public), my harasser’s intrusions were suddenly deemed warranted. I want to suggest an alternative and non-mutually exclusive framework for understanding this phenomenon: male street harassers seem to view and treat women as though we are public spectacles. The word “spectacle” implies some kind of “display” or “performance” that is put on for the benefit of others. This explains why these men (mis)perceive us as “inviting” their attention and remarks. Spectacles can take many forms: an awesome display of fireworks, a gruesome car accident, a confusing message spray-painted on the sidewalk, and so on. Regardless of whether they are viewed positively, negatively, or neutrally, spectacles strike people as conspicuous, and perhaps even unexpected, so they attract attention and commentary. After all, the public spectacle has demanded their attention. This framing also allows us to relate these experiences to the harassment faced by other groups. The intrusive way we treat celebrities out in public immediately comes to mind, but it is also true for socially marginalized groups, such as people of color, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA+ people. Indeed, the notion that these groups are deemed public spectacles who supposedly issue phantom invitations helps to explain the prevalence of many forms of unwanted attention they may face (rude comments, invasive questions, nonconsensual touching, etc.) as well as the common victim-blaming accusation that they must have been “asking for it”. Furthermore, it allows us to readily understand why individuals who lie at the intersection of multiple forms of marginalization (for example, women of color) face far more frequent or extreme expressions of public harassment. Understanding that some people may be marked as public spectacles in our eyes has helped me to make sense of my own personal experiences receiving unwanted attention. But it has also enabled me to become more cognizant of how I may be unconsciously perceiving and interpreting other people, especially those who strike me as “different” in some way.While every marginalized group faces somewhat different circumstances, recognizing this shared underlying dynamic provides us with an opportunity to better understand and more readily learn from one another.

5/16/2022,"Developed from a 2016 short, Matt Glass and Jordan Wayne Long’s post-US Civil War supernatural thriller isn’t just atmospheric and characterful, it’s an often shrewd allegory of the US self-image as the shining “city on a hill”. Thomas Hobson plays James McCune, a black doctor and war veteran nurturing physical and psychological wounds, who is summoned by his Uncle Matthew (Phil Morris) to a post in Norfolk, a walled town sequestered deep in the Ozark forest. When he arrives, he is shocked to encounter a biracial paradise where, as the preachy saloon murals have it, “To each their purpose”. But there are strict rules, imposed by Matthew, about venturing beyond the palisade where horned ghosts are apt to emerge from banks of red fog with a particular hunger for local troublemakers. As another mural counsels, “Honour your ghosts”. There’s something almost Twin Peaksy about this idyll around which dark forces muster. The film gathers together a fruity gallery of oddballs, including David Arquette as a friendly amateur photographer and Tim Blake Nelson as the blind Scandinavian saloon owner (following up his O Brother, Where Art Thou? yodelling and his turn as the West Texas Tit in The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, he gets a great musical number). Lingering among this motley lineup is a pleasure, bedded in by Long’s superb production design and Brianna Quick’s costumes, though, given the town’s supposed racial composition, it’s strange that the supporting cast isn’t more diverse. At first Norfolk seems to stand as a contrast to the rest of the US, but as James digs into its underbelly, it becomes clear it is actually a symbol of the country and its flaws: its propensity to corrupt its elite and co-opt minorities, and the historical fog of violence used to prop up power. Glass and Long slightly struggle to get their story moving under this allegorical weight – it mostly revolves around James’s quasi-romantic involvement with Annie (Tara Perry, who also co-wrote), a hunter living outside the walls. And, once under way, the film sometimes rushes to fulfil its conclusions, down to a rather anticlimactic reveal. But there’s purpose and pointedness here all the same.

5/16/2022,"Two shocking bereavements, separated by more than a century, will link unsuspecting sides of a family in Cressida Connolly’s haunting and beautiful novel. Other writers might have stretched this material to saga length. Bad Relations confines its scope to fewer than 300 pages and reverberates the more for its deft compression. It begins amid the smoke and chaos of a battlefield in the Crimea, where Captain William Gale cuts a lock of hair from the head of his dead younger brother, Algie – a memento for their parents back home in Gloucestershire. Meanwhile, William’s wife, Alice, prays for his safe return and writes him letters deploring the prosecution of the war, a radical streak destined to come between them. For in spite of her loving ways and the young son she has borne him, William grows distant from Alice on his return to England; unreasonable at first, then unreachable, he is not the gentle husband who went off to war years before. “Small gusts of fury blew through him yet not away from him.” Those gusts presage a thunderstorm that will rend and wreck. The scene shifts to 1977 and a farm near Truro, Cornwall, where hormonal tumult is in play. A mild-mannered 17-year-old, Stephen, has arrived from Melbourne to stay with distant cousins. He immediately fancies Cass, but ends up in bed with her sister, Georgie, and amid a hazy atmosphere of dope, dancing and parental disapproval, a long hot summer suddenly boils over. An acid trip wreaks havoc and sends one unfortunate youth into a deadly spiral of psychosis. The final part of the novel springs forward to 2016, when a middle-aged Australian, Hazel, visits family in England she has never met, their remote connection a great-great-grandfather, William Gale. What Connolly handles so expertly is the way scattered fragments of the past overlay the present. The ownership of a Victoria Cross awarded to William, one of the first in the British army, shimmers in and out of the reader’s sightline, destined to put two sides of the family at odds a century later. The suspense becomes almost sickening. During a clear-out, the discovery of a locket with hair coiled inside it prompts Cass and Georgie to speculate on whose it was – “some ancestor”, they suppose, whom we know to be Algernon Gale, his corpse still warm on the book’s first page. Life and death are intimately entwined. The hands of a dead man are “waxen, like a stale candle”, while a wounded man’s hand is “still as a bunch of white radishes”. Receiving his medal from Queen Victoria, William notices the royal hands are “as pale as unripe fruit”. Oh, for the touch of these vanished hands… But an even subtler reckoning of loss is expressed in different feelings about a tragedy over time. Hazel has endured raw grief over the long-ago death of her brother: “It sometimes seemed as if she’d spent her whole life missing him, or trying not to”. Yet the photographs of him as a schoolboy she once found too poignant to look at she now rediscovers in a sad spirit of fondness. The volatile nature of families is conjured here with a superbly noticing eye. The love and tension crackling between the sisters are set against the legacy of their awful mother, Celia, whose cold snobbishness has had a long, lowering effect. Connolly conducts us through this emotional minefield with great delicacy, balancing compassion with beadiness, much as she did in her previous (wonderful) novel After the Party (2018), also about sisterly estrangement after an ill-starred flirtation with Mosleyite fascists. In recent British fiction I can think only of Tessa Hadley who rivals Connolly in exacting such intricate, compelling drama from close-knit families. But it’s also her feel for discrete historical periods – the corseted morality of the 1860s, the 1970s of cheesecloth, discos and strawberry Mivvis – that put us so precisely inside her characters’ Englishness. Bad Relations evinces not just an extraordinary level of skill but a kind of humility on the author’s part not to outstay her welcome. I don’t often wish a book were longer, but this one I did.

5/16/2022,"The Truman Show is a 1990s Hollywood movie about a man who lives in a bubble, cut off from the world. As played by Jim Carrey, Truman Burbank – surrounded by actors, his every move dogged by cameras – stares at a stage set and believes that it’s real. In the film’s final scene he climbs the stairs, finds a door and prepares to escape his gilded cage. That keynote image – Truman’s ascent against a painted sky – is now the official poster for the forthcoming Cannes film festival, soon to be plastered on programmes, Blu-Tacked in shop windows and rigged like a godhead across the concrete Palais. And while we should be wary of judging an event by its cover, the choice of image feels apt. The organisers picked it, they say, because it “represents a poetic celebration of the quest for expression and freedom”. Others may read it as a self-owning comment on the festival as a whole. That’s the perennial question about Cannes, that millionaire’s playground on the Côte d’Azur. Is it the bubble or the door, the sickness or the cure? A creative response to the woes of the world or a means of laundering its worst excesses? Nobody is certain. The jury’s always out. Cannes thrives on frictions, contradictions; that’s part of its appeal. But pull the elastic too hard and sooner or later it snaps. This year marks the festival’s 75th edition, a birthday of sorts. It provides the perfect excuse to rewind through the event’s past, celebrating its history as a home for provocation, a seedbed for the Nouvelle Vague, New Hollywood, the buena onda of Latin American cinema. But it’s also a chance to reset the compass, to map out the future. Judged on face value, this year’s lineup is terrific. There are new films from David Cronenberg, Claire Denis, George Miller, Kelly Reichardt; a shrewd balance of arthouse delicacies with tasty cinematic junk food (Top Gun: Maverick; Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic). It’s almost enough to distract from the troubles piling up all around. Industry upheaval. The pandemic. Ukraine. It is a good year already for the British producer Mike Goodridge, who has two films in the main competition. Triangle of Sadness is the new comedy from Ruben Östlund, who won the 2017 Palme d’Or for his art-world satire The Square. Tchaikovsky’s Wife is a period drama by the dissident Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov. Cannes has banned official Russian delegations this year, but individual artists (most of whom are at odds with the Putin regime anyway) are always welcome. The producer thinks that’s fair enough. Serebrennikov, he explains, has just spent several years under house arrest: “He’s the last person who should be receiving a cultural boycott.” Goodridge first came to Cannes back in 1991. He has been a journalist, a sales agent and a festival director himself. So he’s come at the event from pretty much every angle and largely made peace with its manifest contradictions. Cannes, he argues, is still the world’s most exciting film festival. Moreover, it may be the last great champion of cinema itself, doggedly wedded to the old theatrical business model and forcing made-for-TV Netflix content to screen in Venice instead. “Cannes is dedicated to protecting the sacred art of cinema,” he says. “And the Cannes Palais, as well as being a place of discovery, is cinema’s ultimate cathedral. It changes your life. It changes the way you see the world.” Inevitably, there’s a downside, too. “The worst thing about Cannes, I suppose, is the rarefied nature of it. It is elitist. It is snobby. And yes, it is slow to change. The selection process isn’t flawless. There needs to be more fresh blood, just to mix it up. You do get sick of seeing the same old faces in the main competition.” We’re back to those Cannes frictions again. For every action, a reaction. For every high, a crushing low. I have been coming to the festival for years and still can’t pin it down. It is at once radical and hidebound, serious and silly, horribly hierarchical and airily democratic. Or to put it another way, Cannes is the Walt Whitman of film festivals. It contains multitudes. It contradicts itself. Outside the Palais, the impenetrable arthouse puzzle is accorded the same red carpet treatment as the A-list Hollywood blockbuster. Inside, the highbrow main competition is offset by a lowbrow film market, selling Asian erotic thrillers with garbled English blurbs (“In a small apartment, she was almost like an old goddess to him”). At night, on the harbour, the oligarch yachts double as film party venues. The revellers raise their champagne flutes en masse to toast the latest social-realist cri de coeur from Bucharest or Timbuktu. Undeniably, it used to be more riotous, more of an obvious circus. I miss the human traffic that used to surge along the Croisette before the security was tightened. The upstart student film-makers bellowing into loud-hailers; the newspaper vendor shouting “Libération!” on the steps. In recent years, Cannes has become safety-conscious, almost cloistered. But does that make it more of a bubble than before? The film-maker Mark Cousins vehemently disagrees. “I have no time for this argument,” he says. Firstly, Cousins explains, Cannes’s natural affinity has always been for the innovator, the underdog, the sort of artists who would normally be left outside in the cold. Secondly, crucially, it remains a physical festival, “a moment in the moshpit”, a vital connection with the offline world. “What used to be called life,” he says. Goodridge compares Cannes to a cathedral. Cousins, for his part, reaches for nautical similes. The festival, he tells me, is like a sea wall against erosion, or a lighthouse in the storm, “battered but sentinel”, directing its beam into the globe’s four corners. That’s a bold claim to make about an event that once staged a stunt involving Jerry Seinfeld in a bee costume on a zip-wire, but he may be right. Because if there is a comedy Cannes and a celebrity Cannes, it follows that there might be a core-principles Cannes, something to cling to when everything else blows away. Also, it’s comforting to think of Cannes as the lighthouse, honest and unyielding. Better that than seeing it as the storm itself. When people speak of Cannes’s radical heyday, they invariably cite the insurrectionist fireworks of May 1968, when Godard and Truffaut stormed the main hall and brought the event to a juddering halt. But Cannes’s political roots go much deeper than that. This is the 75th festival, although by rights it should be older. It was explicitly conceived as a carnival of resistance, a riposte to the fascist event in Venice, which made Joseph Goebbels its guest of honour and awarded the “Mussolini Cup” to a Leni Riefenstahl picture. The inaugural Cannes festival was due to get under way on 1 September 1939. When Hitler’s tanks rolled into Poland, the festival was cancelled a few hours in. I sometimes think Cannes’s champions could make more of this genesis. It’s like a superhero origin tale: a call to arms, a rising up. Politics is in Cannes’s DNA. The French writer Agnès Poirier argues that its history is fundamental. “More than any other festival, it has never been afraid to take a stance on the world,” she says. Cannes was built in a spirit of inclusion, tolerance and empathy with other cultures. That’s why it likes provocative artists who rattle our cages (Hitchcock, Gaspar Noé, Lars von Trier). It’s why it loves dissident artists who shed a light on injustice. Sergei Loznitsa’s film Donbass sounded the alarm of a burgeoning crisis in eastern Ukraine. Andrey Zvyagintsev’s Loveless warned of creeping moral rot among the Moscow middle class. Cannes plays both sides, but it engages with the world. The photocalls and fashion disasters ensure that the festival is noticed. But those stage-managed frivolities sell its produce far and wide. “Well, it’s interesting that you would say it’s frivolous,” says Poirier. “That’s probably a British perspective. In France, Cannes has never been seen as frivolous. For us it’s very serious. It’s our political class. It’s our university of geopolitics. It’s where we come for knowledge of the parts of the world we’ve never visited.” For 12 days this month the Cannes faithful will gather outside the Palais. They’ll kick their heels beneath the giant image of Truman Burbank climbing against the painted sky, forever hunting for his exit route. Once through the gates, those guests have free run of the programme; the only limit is time. They may see a masterpiece. They may see a turkey. They may be whisked off to São Paulo, Harare or Muscat. They may witness something that changes the way they see the world. Sure, Cannes is a bubble. But the movies: those are doors. The 75th Cannes film festival runs from 17 to 28 May.

5/16/2022,"Ryanair has warned of a “fragile” recovery in airline passenger numbers after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Omicron coronavirus variant pushed it to a €355m loss for the financial year. The Irish airline would aim for a “return to reasonable profitability” over the financial year to March 2023, it said on Monday, after it lost €1.4bn (£1.2bn) during the first two pandemic-affected financial years. Airlines have been hanging on for the return of passengers following two years of travel restrictions. There were high hopes for significant earnings in the 2022 summer holiday season after many countries lifted bans on tourism, but the knock-on effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine plus staffing difficulties have clouded airlines’ prospects. Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said “we hope to return to reasonable profitability” in the coming year and highlighted “pent-up demand” despite uncertainty. The “recovery is strong but can be fragile”, he said. “With luck we’ll have a strong summer.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant “immediately damaged close-in bookings and yields for the Christmas and Easter peak travel periods”, O’Leary said. Ryanair’s revenues tripled to €4.8bn in the year to 31 March 2022 compared with the first year of coronavirus lockdowns. The airline is planning to fly 165 million passengers in the current financial year, up from 97 million in the year to March and an increase even on its peak of 149 million passengers in the years before Covid-19. Yet the company said that ticket pricing in the current financial quarter “continues to need stimulation” with lower prices to attract more customers. Airlines’ ability to attract customers at higher prices is likely to be impacted in the coming months by the cost of living crisis, with families left with less money to spend after covering rising fuel and food prices. O’Leary nevertheless said the company was better placed than rivals, and that it would use any weakness in demand to take a greater market share. He said: “There’s a lot of capacity cutbacks and hopefully we’re going to be the beneficiaries of that.” Ryanair is not having to cope with delays in recruitment suffered by rivals as they wait for security approvals, he added, although he criticised airports for failing to cope with increasing numbers of passengers, leading to queues at airport security in several city hubs including Heathrow and Manchester in England. He said he hoped those problems would ease in time for the peak summer period. “We are seeing pinch points in airports,” he said. “In Dublin, Berlin, there are airport security queues, where they are struggling to get low-wage, frontline crew into work.” O’Leary also said he was concerned that rivals had “talked up” the prospects for a strong summer, and that there was a need for caution going into the winter because of the possibility of a new coronavirus variant or a worsening global economy amid global inflationary pressures.",News/Business,Ryanair warns of ‘fragile’ recovery as Ukraine war and Covid push it to loss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/ryanair-ukraine-war-covid-michael-oleary-profits
5/16/2022,"The New South Wales government has been urged to learn from past mistakes after a review of the deadly March 2021 flooding found staffing and communication problems at the state’s emergency service hampered operations, as many people claim also happened this year in Lismore. The review made 28 recommendations after interrogating the NSW State Emergency Service’s response to the catastrophic flooding, pointing to poorly trained and overworked volunteers, insufficient staff, improper equipment and out-of-date flood plans as key issues. The Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council’s report found key flood indicators were missed and warnings were sent too late because of the lack of staff at the agency. At the end of June last year there were just 333 SES staff and about 10,200 volunteer members. Similar issues with communication and flood warnings, as well as lack of appropriate equipment and training, have been highlighted in the wake of the northern rivers flooding earlier this year. The investigation found that trained incident managers were hard to come by during the 2021 crisis, meaning those who knew what they were doing were left with too much responsibility. In one case, an intelligence support officer was left to monitor nine river systems all operating at “major flood level”, which meant “a number of significant flood triggers [were] missed”. This resulted in late or no evacuation orders being issued for some affected communities, which posed “a significant risk”. It also found some volunteers were left manning police radios without the training to do so and many facilities were not fit for purpose and lacking important technology, seating and meeting rooms, which affected the agency’s ability to manage the crisis. Among key recommendations were for the NSW SES to prepare a business case for additional resources and staff, expand the presence of the Bureau of Meteorology within the agency and develop preprepared flood communication packs. The state opposition’s emergency services spokesperson, Jihad Dib, said the NSW government had failed to learn “key lessons” last year and called on it to respond to the recommendations, including better resourcing of the largely volunteer-driven agency. “No disaster is alike but the same mistakes around lack of resourcing, coordination and mixed communication seem to be a common occurrence,” he said. “What is disturbing about these recommendations is how applicable they are to the 2022 floods. “The government needs to better resource the SES because the science tells us that these severe weather events will become more frequent.” The report has been handed to the state government and the heads of the independent inquiry set up after flooding devastated Lismore and many parts of northern NSW earlier in the year. Steph Cooke, the emergency services minister, said the government would consider “recommendations and common themes” from this report and the upcoming independent inquiry report. The NSW SES commissioner, Carlene York, said the agency had already started addressing issues raised in the report and more would be done. “The service is also awaiting the outcomes of the 2022 NSW flood inquiry to undertake and prioritise improvements to management and response to catastrophic events of the scale seen in 2021, and again in 2022,” she said.",News/Australia news,"SES resourcing issues existed a year before latest NSW floods, review finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/ses-resourcing-issues-existed-a-year-before-the-latest-nsw-floods-review-finds
5/16/2022,"Victorian state MP Bernie Finn will face a move to expel him from the parliamentary Liberal party after he repeatedly expressed his opposition to abortion. Guardian Australia understands the motion to expel Finn has the support of senior opposition MPs and is expected to pass at a meeting next Tuesday. If passed, Finn would be forced to sit on the crossbench in the upper house and would be unable to run again as a Liberal at November’s state election. The motion would not expel Finn from the Liberal party, meaning he could retain his membership. Finn was criticised this month after saying on Facebook he was “praying” for abortion to be banned in Australia. His comments came after the leak of a draft decision showing a majority of US supreme court justices may overturn Roe v Wade, which ruled abortion was a constitutional right. In his post, Finn said “killing babies is criminal”. When a woman commented that she did not support abortion but believed there should be options for women who are victims of rape, Finn replied: “Babies should not be killed for the crime of his or her parent.” After Finn’s comments, the opposition leader, Matthew Guy, said the Liberal party was “absolutely sick” of Finn’s social media posts and said he should consider if he wished to remain a Liberal MP. Finn resigned as the opposition’s whip in the state’s upper house days later, but that has not stopped members of his party moving against him. In a statement on Monday, Guy said it was “imperative” that Liberal MPs were “solely focused on recovering and rebuilding Victoria”. “A continued lack of discipline and repeated actions detrimental to the party’s ability to stand up for the interests of Victorians has left no other option but to consider Mr Finn’s eligibility to represent the Liberal party,” he said in a statement. Guardian Australia has confirmed with several Liberal party sources the motion to expel Finn is expected to take place at a party room meeting next Tuesday. One Liberal MP, who requested anonymity, said Finn’s views were “repugnant and do not represent the party”.

He once likened the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, to Adolf Hitler, and shared pro-Trump conspiracy theories including the claim that the former president was “improperly” removed from office. He has been an upper house MP since 2006. Between 1992 and 1999 he was a lower house MP for the electorate of Tullamarine before it was abolished in 2002. Earlier this year, Guy dismissed reports Finn would be challenged for the No 1 position on the Western Metropolitan upper house ticket. He described Finn as a “very loud and proud conservative”.

5/16/2022,"On Saturday a white teenager traveled almost 200 miles to a Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York, where he brutally killed 10 people and injured three others in a grocery story. Like other far-right terrorists in the past years, he livestreamed his terrorist attack and left a “manifesto.” And, as after other terrorist attacks, experts and journalists are happily amplifying his message and blaming social media and the government for this tragedy. The problem is, we can talk endlessly about better regulating social media or calling for even more funding and powers for public and private “counterterrorism” organizations, but none of that will make us safer as long as the broader conservative movement embraces and propagates far-right propaganda. This is a point worth repeating, even if I and others have made it many times before. The so-called “manifesto” of the terrorist included a lot of the standard tropes of the far right, including the so-called Great Replacement Theory. Often linked to antisemitism, this conspiracy theory holds that “the Left” is supporting “open borders” to replace the “original people” with “immigrants”, who are inferior and therefore easier to control. Variants of this theory go back to at least the original Populists of the mid-19th century, but in its current iteration it has been around since the start of the 1980s postwar far right in Europe. When I started to study the far right in the early 1990s, similar theories were pushed by radical right parties like the Dutch Center Party or the French National Front. At that time, these parties polled in the single digits and were kept out of political coalitions and the media by a so-called cordon sanitaire. Today, these actors and ideas have become part of the political mainstream. In few countries has this process of mainstreaming has been as successful and visible as in the United States, where the main representatives of the mainstream right-wing, like Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, are propagating the Great Replacement Theory with great success. Just a few days before the terrorist attack, a poll showed that nearly half of Republicans believe the conspiracy theory. Since the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, I have had various informal conversations with people who work in Congress or in other state agencies about the far-right. They tell me that they want to talk about the threat it poses, but then rapidly narrow the focus to “online radicalization” and violent groups with scary names like Atomwaffen Division or Feuerkrieg Division. This is not just because these groups get disproportionate attention in the media and the counter-terrorism industry, but because they are politically safe. These groups are so extreme that they are out of bounds for almost all political elites, even on the right. But they are also small and marginal. This is not the case for most other more mainstream actors and ideas of the far right. In fact, their power is now so great in Washington, that it is almost impossible to come up with a term that is acceptable to both sides of the political spectrum. Republicans are skeptical about terms like “far right” and “racism,” fearing this would include groups and ideas they sympathize with. This is not without reason. The Grand Old Party has become a far-right party that advances racist arguments in both implicit and explicit form. And many organizations within the broader “conservative” movement have followed suit, from Fox News to Turning Point USA. I am not arguing that Tucker Carlson is responsible for the terrorist attack in Buffalo. But that terrorist did not develop his racist ideas by himself. There are few if any real “lone wolves.” Far-right terrorists are part of a larger subculture, online and offline, which is connected to the broader conservative movement. We can ban a few more individuals from Twitter, but as long as similar conspiracy theories and ideas are propagated in Congress or on Fox News, these bans will not help much. Similarly, most preventative and repressive policies will have little positive effect, and possibly even have a negative effect. I am a big fan of the work of my colleague Cynthia Miller-Idriss and her team at Peril, one of the few prominent voices that argues against further securitization of the far right. Inspired by efforts in Germany, she calls for a non-repressive measure to counter the far right, including some type of “civil education.” The problem is, while that might make sense in California or New York, it would be impossible, even illegal, in states like Florida and Georgia, where recent “anti-CRT laws” have criminalized real anti-racism. Obviously, I am not arguing that we should not do anything about this threat. The Democratic party and President Joe Biden should do more. In his inaugural speech, Biden said that “we must confront and we will defeat” the rise of political extremism, white supremacy, and domestic terrorism. One and a half year later, the Republican Party has declared the storming of the Capitol to be “legitimate political discourse” and is attacking both human rights and the democratic system across the country. The sad reality is that fighting the far right has become a highly partisan affair in the United States. Any attempt to make this a bipartisan effort means watering down of measures and limiting them to the most extremist fringes. If Biden and the Democrats really want to fight white supremacy, including institutional racism, they must do it without the Republican party. Not only is the current Republican party not part of the solution, it is a big part of the problem.

5/16/2022,"If it felt like a long time coming, that’s because it has been. Amid the gaudy pomp and ceremony, the Queen’s speech contained a series of pledges that could substantially improve life for millions of renters across the UK. Sitting against an almost comically gilded backdrop, Prince Charles spoke of a government ready to “improve the regulation of social housing, strengthen the rights of tenants and ensure better quality safer homes”. The proposed renters’ reform bill contains one particularly eye-catching commitment. For years, housing activists and charities have fought for the abolition of section 21 of the Housing Act (1988), an insidious piece of Thatcherite legislation that became better known as “no-fault evictions”. The premise is simple enough. Under the terms of section 21, private landlords have been able to evict tenants without a reason, and giving just two months notice. This isn’t the first time such a promise has been made. In the spring of 2019, Theresa May’s government sounded its intention to scrap no-fault evictions, after the then housing minister, James Brokenshire, apparently experienced a Damascene moment of clarity during a visit to a homeless people’s shelter in Bristol. But the following three years have only seen the practice intensify, despite the brief lull occasioned by the temporary pandemic eviction ban. According to research by Shelter, the UK’s largest housing charity, an extra 200,000 private renters in England were served with no-fault evictions since the first commitment to scrap them was issued, at a rate of one every seven minutes. Change was supposed to arrive finally in 2021, before being shelved until last week. Though the latest pledge has been broadly welcomed by campaigners and housing charities, most have struck a note of caution. Promises are easily made. Guiding them through into law is another matter entirely. “The quicker we put no-fault evictions on the scrapheap, the better”, said Polly Neate, Shelter’s chief executive. “This unfair practice has no place in our society and the government agrees – but its promises are just words on a page until they become law. The government needs to finish the job and get rid of section 21, because every minute wasted leaves renters at risk.” The idea of a “no-fault eviction” always carried an air of phoney moral neutrality. Perhaps the intention was to provide some crumbs of comfort, in knowing at least that you weren’t expected to shoulder any blame for being turfed out of your home at minimal statutory notice. It’s an issue that has cut across demographics and regions. A form of legally built-in precarity that has hit north and south, young and old alike. The young family in Bedfordshire who had to scrabble for a new place, only to find themselves paying £350 more a month and with their savings obliterated. The woman and her and daughter in Manchester, turfed out after 15 years for daring to request repairs to their home. Many have spoken of a perpetual stress that amounts to physical illness. Though doubtlessly a positive step, scrapping section 21 doesn’t do much to address the problem of spiralling rents. After all, much has recently been written about the cost-of-living crisis, a catastrophe of steeply rising prices seemingly spread across every essential need of daily life, where food, fuel and shelter are increasingly sources of anxiety for millions. Over the past year, private rents have risen at record rates across the UK, with demand greatly outstripping supply (on some property websites, prospective tenants now outnumber available properties by three to one). By 2024, the number of people living with homelessness is expected to climb by a third. An approaching “tidal wave” of need and misery, as local authorities and charities have warned. About 66,000 people are expected to be forced into the hidden precarity of sofa-surfing, or into desperately unsuitable temporary accommodation. Others will be out on the streets, trying to fend for themselves as best they can. More than 1,200 people in the UK died while homeless in 2021 – a 32% rise in the course of a year. The landlord trade press has, predictably enough, not reacted kindly to the proposed changes. In an open letter to Shelter, the chief executive of the National Residential Landlords Association accused the charity of presenting “a disappointingly one-sided picture” and “sensationalising” the issue. Some have even thundered about the great unfairness visited on the overwhelming majority of hard-working, benevolent landlords who will now find it tougher to eject problem tenants. One buy-to-let landlord (with seven properties spread across Norfolk) explained to the Telegraph that she’d been so spooked by the abolition of section 21 that she felt she had no choice other than to evict one long-term tenant of six years, who had never missed a rent payment. After refurbishing the house, she’d raised the rent by £130 a month, while the ex-tenant was forced into sofa-surfing. The UK’s absurdly overheated “housing market” has long needed urgent reform. Decades of under-regulation and structural neglect have led to a terribly unbalanced present, where rising homelessness and chronic anxiety have somehow become entrenched facts of daily life. This wasn’t an inevitability, and change is always possible. The abolition of section 21 will be a welcome step, whenever it finally occurs. But there is much more to be done.

5/16/2022,"Chelsea’s Abramovich era has launched the careers of many promising footballers into the stratosphere. It has also halted a few in their tracks. Steve Sidwell, Scott Parker and Danny Drinkwater all left clubs where they were hot properties to sign for Chelsea, where they spent varying portions of their prime years watching blankly from the dugout. To this list we can add Ross Barkley, trusted to take a penalty but nothing more on Saturday by a manager for whom he has played 428 minutes this season. Five years after moving to west London, Barkley has started fewer league games for Chelsea than he did in his final season at Everton, and has had as many managers as he has scored league goals. Not every talented youngster will fulfil their potential; not every transfer will be a success. But it’s hard to think back to Barkley’s breakout years and not lament the scattergun stockpiling in which football’s super-clubs can afford to indulge. Alex Hess Match report: Chelsea 0-0 Liverpool (5-6 pens) Two straight defeats have taken Burnley back into the relegation zone and Thursday’s visit to Aston Villa has assumed monumental proportions. There was room for optimism in a battling performance at Tottenham that arguably deserved a draw, though. “I am really proud of the group,” Mike Jackson said. “They had a right go today. I’ve seen a group that was fighting and had spirit.” A point at Villa Park will keep their fate in their hands. Jackson will have to decide whether to stick with the five-man back line that largely blunted Spurs, or whether to be more expansive and go for the early goal that might make life considerably easier. There is the added complication that, unusually, they played Villa at home nine days ago and were well beaten. Jackson must get the formula right but has shown an ability to set up a team that can handle the fight. Nick Ames Match report: Tottenham 1-0 Burnley Wilfried Zaha is enjoying fruitful times. As his powers peak, so do his returns. More finisher than creator now, Zaha’s 13 league goals this season is a career high. His previous best (11) came last year. But that less welcome part of his game – the side that sees him engage with baying crowds – remains. At Villa Park, Zaha did so with a beaming smile but it is still energy best channelled elsewhere. “This is part of Wilfried, his character, his personality,” explained Patrick Vieira. “It is a strength and a weakness at the same time. He is a target player and has to manage his mind, to keep that energy, that strength to allow him to make the difference in the last third.” Vieira knows that when Zaha mismanages things, life becomes easier for his opponents. “It’s a sideshow,” Steven Gerrard said. “He had a really quiet afternoon. We dealt with him really well.” Sam Dalling Match report: Aston Villa 1-1 Crystal Palace Pascal Struijk’s added-time equaliser for Leeds not only changes the dynamics surrounding the final week of the relegation battle but the entire mentality around Elland Road. Just a few minutes before Struijk scrambled home Joe Gelhardt’s cross, deafening renditions of Marcelo Bielsa’s name could be heard before the home supporters turned their ire on the board. It threatened to overshadow the bigger challenge at hand for Leeds, given how sacking Bielsa in February remains an incredible gamble that remains grossly unpopular with large swathes of Leeds fans. But as Struijk headed home and Elland Road erupted, the mood changed, as did the permutations. Burnley could change the whole script again if they get a result at Aston Villa on Thursday night but for the first time in a few weeks, Leeds supporters can look at the table with tentative confidence. If momentum really is a thing in sport then Struijk, the unlikeliest of heroes, has ensured Leeds have at least a sliver of it with one game remaining. Aaron Bower Match report: Leeds 1-1 Brighton It’s been a strange season for Leicester. Last year’s FA Cup win came off the back of two strong league campaigns, and it looked like a young, talented, improving squad would push on again. But though things haven’t turned out like that, they haven’t wasted their time. Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall has established himself, James Maddison has rediscovered himself – and Harvey Barnes – scorer of two fine goals – is a better player now than in August. But at some point soon, and despite his brace, they must replace Jamie Vardy. In an ideal world, his role from now on would be as rotation player and impact sub. The question is whether Patson Daka is ready to step up. Though he has shown flashes of immense ability – at both Leicester and RB Salzburg – he has struggled in recent months. The onus is now on him to find the consistency it’ll take to displace a club legend. Daniel Harris  Match report: Watford 1-5 Leicester Manchester City’s injury worries in defence are well documented, but it was interesting last week to see Fernandinho support the idea that youngsters CJ Egan-Riley and Lucas Mbete deserved some game time in the title run-in. At West Ham, Pep Guardiola opted for experience, with Fernandinho starting at centre-back. The Brazilian is a legend at City but increasingly looking like a weak link, with Michail Antonio and Jarrod Bowen exposing the 37-year-old on the counter. Both West Ham’s goals capitalised on the space in behind and Fernandinho was also wasteful with the ball, including a poor back-pass that might have led to a third Hammers goal. Fernandinho deserves some sort of send-off before his return to Brazil this summer but it would be a shock to see him deployed in defence again for City’s crucial final game against Aston Villa. Michael Butler Match report: West Ham 2-2 Manchester City It’s hard to know what to make of Wolves. They’re far more enjoyable to watch under Bruno Lage than they were when Nuno Espírito Santo was in charge. And yet 37 goals in 37 games – the fewest of any side outside the bottom three – is almost as miserable as last season’s 36 in 38, the lowest outside the bottom four. Something has to change, and Lage will hope he has the internal solutions. After 10 months out with injury, Pedro Neto is back, and will be much the better for a full pre-season. But the form of Raúl Jiménez must be a worry, his 44 appearances yielding only nine goals, eight yellow cards, and two red cards. The hope is that he is building back confidence and sharpness after a long time out as a result of a potentially life-threatening head injury, but if he does not start next season well, his manager will – reluctantly, no doubt – need an alternative. Daniel Harris  Match report: Wolves 1-1 Norwich Just when it seemed Everton had edged their way to safety, they returned to the farce that has dragged them down all season. Two red cards and some desperate defending left Frank Lampard’s team needing something from Thursday at home to Crystal Palace and next Sunday at Arsenal to stay ahead of Burnley and Leeds. In the Goodison stands, Joe Royle and Peter Reid, both playing legends, with Royle a former manager, looked on, while the chairman, Bill Kenwright, looked positively tortured alongside them. Each of those famous Evertonians would recognise the mayhem that can grip their beloved club. It had briefly seemed that Lampard had harnessed the chaos, and Everton fans have responded warmly enough to his leadership. But his team still have no recognisable approach and lack discipline. Burnley’s and Leeds’s problems mean Everton will probably survive but a tough close-season awaits. Farce, chaos and mayhem rarely add up to sustained success. John Brewin  Match report: Everton 2-3 Brentford The England coach, Sarina Wiegman, was at Wembley on Sunday and will surely have learned far more from this high-stakes FA Cup final than any number of bloodless qualifiers. Keira Walsh and Alex Greenwood both excelled in defeat for Manchester City; Millie Bright and Jess Carter both advanced their cases for Chelsea. But the real bright spot was City winger Lauren Hemp, who feels increasingly pivotal to England’s chances this summer. The next big women’s game at Wembley will be the Euro 2022 final. Will England be there? Jonathan Liew Match report: Chelsea 3-2 Manchester City In August 1974, Liverpool beat Leeds United 6-5 on penalties to win the Charity Shield – the first of 26 shootouts in which they’ve competed. Of those, a quite ridiculous 19 have been won, including two European Cup finals, two FA Cup finals and three League Cup finals. Two of them have come this season, at the end of goalless draws against Chelsea. On the face of things, what happened in, say, Rome in 1984 has nothing whatsoever to do with what happened at Wembley on Saturday. But an overall success rate of 73.08% cannot possibly be a coincidence, and instead speaks volumes about Liverpool’s mythology and self-mythologising – veins into which Jürgen Klopp has tapped so astutely. Of course, all professional footballers are capable of beating a goalkeeper with a free shot from 12 yards, but Klopp has given those who play for him confidence, entitlement and aggression, their sense of history and destiny bordering on the messianic – and they are not finished yet.

5/16/2022,"At the start of another sporting weekend dominated by football Maro Itoje gave an interview which sounded like a cri de coeur. Rugby, the England flanker warned, needed to do more to grow its game, to market itself better against more media‑savvy sports and to engage with those outside its “stereotypical” world. “Rugby is very good at speaking to its own market, at preaching to the choir,” he told the Mirror. “There’s an awful lot of room for improvement. There’s no way you can tell me Formula One is more exciting than rugby. Yet it’s definitely packaged better.” But rugby is far from the only sport caught between a hardcore fanbase and potential new audiences, the comfortable and the uncertain, unsure whether to stick or twist. Athletics and racing are, too. Meanwhile they and others cast envious eyes at F1, which has catapulted itself into the lucrative US market and elsewhere in the blink of an eye. I thought of Itoje’s words on Saturday while part of a raucous crowd watching the Night of the 10,000m PBs on Hampstead Heath, a very unusual day of athletics culminating in women’s and men’s races which doubled as qualifiers for the World Athletics Championships in July. When the organiser, Ben Pochee, came up with the idea nine years ago, barely 100 people came to watch. But there were more like 5,000 there on Saturday night, nursing beers and eating burgers, and – unlike at other meetings – allowed in the infield and on lane eight of the track. One British athlete, Melissa Courtney-Bryant, described the atmosphere as “insane”, adding: “I’ve never raced in anything like it.” Another, Team GB’s Tokyo Olympics marathon star, Chris Thompson, equated it to being at the darts and admitted it was cool he was able to exchange the odd word with spectators. Meanwhile the Olympic pole vault bronze medallist Holly Bradshaw reckoned that, if the UK hosted more such meetings, we would get to see top GB athletes competing more often. Also watching on was track and field’s original hellraiser, Dave Bedford, still instantly recognisable by the Zapata moustache he sported when breaking the 10,000m world record nearly 50 years ago. “This could be the future of the sport,” he said. “What Ben Pochee has done is incredible, but you could do it with every event. Imagine watching some of the best 100m or 200m runners up close, or pole vaulters clearing the height of a double-decker bus from a few metres away?” There was something else that Bedford wanted to stress. Athletes themselves also have to be willing to show more of their unvarnished personalities, for better and for worse, and to engage with the media. “I liked the Guardian’s John Rodda and also trusted him not to turn me over,” he said. “So whenever he called me I always picked up the phone.” Bedford’s legendary attitude on and off the track made him so well known that, 50 years ago this summer, he made the Guardian’s front page when he famously shot at the race walker Paul Nihill with an air rifle in St Moritz while training for the Munich Olympics. Rodda wrote at the time: “Nihill said he was standing on the balcony watching Bedford practise when suddenly Bedford swung round and pointed the rifle in Nihill’s direction.” Nihill explained: “I instinctively moved back, heard the shot and had just got behind the glass which divides my balcony from the next one.” Rodda was also able to get the other side of the story. “Bedford regarded the incident lightly when I spoke to him,” he wrote, “and said he was not aiming at Nihill but at the balcony next door.” Of course we live in different times. No one is advocating athletes take literal potshots at each other. But there are certain fundamentals that remain timeless. Sport thrives on narrative, rivalries and personalities. It also needs to adapt with times and trends. Yet too often its gatekeepers are resistant to change, suspicious of outsiders and anyone who isn’t a pure cheerleader. I experienced this after tweeting that the club athlete Ellis Cross had outsprinted Mo Farah at the Vitality London 10,000 – before suggesting Farah’s career at elite level was surely finished. It made for a cracking story, with Britain’s most successful Olympian being beaten by someone known only by the most diehard of fans. However, some took a different view, including a British Olympian who responded on Twitter. “Sad journalism! Mo was magnanimous in defeat, as Ellis was in winning. Shame journalism can’t be more positive or progressive than this. Get to know the sport better!” What the respondent did not perhaps realise was that my tweet was purely factual. Cross had proudly described himself as a club runner after crossing the line, explaining he had even had to pay his £37 entry fee to compete, while Farah indicated his career as a track runner was probably over, too. Yet it still created a minor athletics culture war over what, exactly, constituted an elite athlete. The bigger picture, surely, was that it gave the sport a rare appearance on the back pages and on national TV, while giving the likeable Cross a deserved day in the sun. Yet a small minority appeared desperate to take offence on his behalf. Cross, incidentally, was racing on Saturday – although sadly he had to drop out due to stomach cramps. But he, too, had enjoyed the experience. “This is the best race in the calendar,” he told me. “There’s something special in the air.” The challenge for athletics, now, is to bottle this magic – and spread it.",Sport/Sport,Athletics must learn lessons from Formula One and get on track with new audience | Sean Ingle,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/16/athletics-must-learn-lessons-from-formula-one-and-get-on-track-with-new-audience
5/16/2022,"If the US supreme court follows through with its initial decision to overturn Roe v Wade next month, 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortion. For those who want to protect abortion rights, a governor’s veto pen is about to become all the more powerful. The probable end of Roe has raised the stakes in gubernatorial races across the country, particularly in states with Republican-led legislatures that would probably move to ban abortion unless a Democratic governor steps in. Democratic gubernatorial candidates are now stressing the urgency of the moment to voters, portraying themselves as the last line of defense against an abortion ban in their states. Four states with Republican-controlled legislatures and Democratic governors – Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – are holding gubernatorial races in November. Democrats are also paying close attention to gubernatorial elections in battleground states where Republicans currently control both the governor’s mansion and the state legislature, such as Georgia and Arizona. If the supreme court overturns Roe and Republicans have full control of the state government, abortion bans in those states will become all but certain. Some of the toss-up states holding gubernatorial races this year – including Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona – already have abortion bans on the books that predate Roe, and Republicans have called for their enforcement if the court reverses the landmark case. In Kansas and Pennsylvania, the sitting Democratic governors have both previously vetoed bills restricting abortion access, and those proposals would probably be enacted if a Republican took control. “The leaked draft opinion overturning Roe v Wade makes one thing clear – the future of reproductive rights will be defined at the state level,” said Christina Amestoy, senior communications advisor for the Democratic Governors Association. “Who sits in the governor’s office will determine a woman’s ability to access abortion.” Since the court’s draft opinion was made public, Republican gubernatorial candidates’ views on abortion have come under renewed scrutiny. In Pennsylvania, all four leading Republican gubernatorial candidates have indicated they would support some form of an abortion ban. State senator Doug Mastriano, who now leads in polls ahead of the Tuesday primary, said at a recent debate that he would oppose any exceptions to an abortion ban, such as for rape, incest or the safety of the mother. Josh Shapiro, the presumptive Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Pennsylvania, has already cut an attack ad warning that Mastriano “wants to ban abortion” if elected. “Every one of our opponents has made it clear: they would sign a bill banning abortion and taking away a woman’s right to choose,” said Shapiro’s spokesperson, Manuel Bonder. “With DC failing to protect these rights, Josh Shapiro will stand up and fight to ensure Pennsylvania remains a place where everyone has the freedom to start a family how and when they want to.” A bill to restrict a woman's right to choose will land on the desk of our next Governor, and if one of my GOP opponents wins, they'll sign it into law.I'll veto it.I am the only candidate for Governor who would make that choice. That's a fact. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat running for governor in Arizona, has similarly promised that she will use her veto pen to block abortion restrictions, while also calling for a repeal of the state’s 1901 law that criminalizes administering the procedure. “I will do everything in my power to protect Arizonans’ fundamental freedoms and access to reproductive healthcare, and use my veto power to strike down anti-abortion measures that come across my desk,” Hobbs said after the draft opinion leaked. And Democratic gubernatorial candidates are not simply waiting until election day to take action for the potential end of Roe. Stacey Abrams, the voting rights leader running for governor of Georgia, temporarily paused fundraising for her campaign earlier this month to instead raise money for abortion rights groups. In Michigan, the Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, has filed a lawsuit to block implementation of a 1931 abortion ban that does not allow for exceptions related to rape or incest. Whitmer has also asked the Michigan supreme court to recognize the right to abortion access under the state’s constitution. In her New York Times op-ed published last week, Whitmer warned that it would be nearly impossible to repeal the 1931 ban with Republicans controlling the Michigan legislature, and she underscored the need for Democrats to use every tool at their disposal to protect abortion rights. “We can all sense the hopelessness and despair that tens of millions of American women – our neighbors, family members and friends – are feeling,” Whitmer said. “But despair is a choice, and pessimism is a luxury. We must take unprecedented steps to protect the right to choose.” The likely end of Roe has also started to affect some gubernatorial primaries, as candidates use their views on abortion to distinguish themselves from their opponents. David Perdue, the Trump-backed gubernatorial candidate in Georgia, has called on the sitting Republican governor, Brian Kemp, to call the state legislature back for an emergency session to pass an abortion ban if Roe is overturned. “Georgia voters deserve to know where their governor stands on this issue,” Perdue said after the draft opinion leaked. “You are either going to fight for the sanctity of life or you’re not.” But for the most part, Republicans have tried to downplay how much the end of Roe would affect the midterm elections. “Reminder for those wondering about the politics of the leaked Scotus opinion, Terry McAuliffe spent all fall trying to make abortion THE central issue in the Virginia gov race,” Jesse Hunt, communications director for the Republican Governors Association, said earlier this month. “He lost by 2% in a state Biden won by 10%.” Reminder for those wondering about the politics of the leaked SCOTUS opinion: Terry McAuliffe spent all fall trying to make abortion THE central issue in the VA Gov race…He lost by 2% in a state Biden won by 10% https://t.co/vNEftItbYW Polls show that the probable end of Roe has certainly caught voters’ attention, although many Americans remain more focused on economic issues like record-high inflation. A survey released by Monmouth University last week showed 26% of Americans named economic policy as their most significant concern for the midterm elections, making it the most common response. But abortion was cited almost as often, with 25% of Americans selecting it as their top priority when appraising candidates. Amestoy argued Democratic gubernatorial candidates do not have to choose between campaigning on their plan to combat inflation and their promise to protect abortion rights. Instead, she encouraged candidates to use their opponents’ views on abortion to paint Republicans as out of touch with the needs of average Americans. “Republicans are campaigning on extreme, fringe agendas, like banning abortion, rather than on delivering for families,” Amestoy said. “It’s a stark contrast Democratic governors and candidates can draw while they work to address the concerns voters care most about.” Drawing that contrast is even more important for Democratic gubernatorial candidates with federal abortion legislation stalled in Congress. Last Wednesday, Senate Republicans and Democrat Joe Manchin again blocked a bill that would have codified Roe and secured abortion rights at the national level. If the supreme court does indeed overturn Roe next month without other federal protections in place, individual states’ policies will soon dictate if and how Americans can access abortion. “The reproductive freedoms of millions of Americans are on the line,” Amestoy said. “Electing Democratic governors is our best and perhaps only hope of protecting them.”",News/US news,Abortion rights: how a governor’s veto can protect women’s freedoms,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/roe-v-wade-abortion-rights-governor-veto-elections
5/16/2022,"Argentinian artist Ad Minoliti’s work draws on the legacy of geometric abstraction – art made using forms and shapes, often with bold colours – as “a tool to question patriarchal structures”. Among their influences, Minoliti, who is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns, cites two rival groups of artists in Argentina, the Grupo Madí and Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención (AACI). The work of both groups focuses on geometric abstraction, specifically a movement known as concrete art. First defined by the Dutch artist Theo van Doesburg in 1930, it embraces the use of lines, colours and planes, among other forms, to create art free from any basis in reality. Both Grupo Madí and AACI were born out of a revolutionary period for Argentinian art during the latter half of the 1940s, amid a backdrop of political instability under the military dictatorship of General Juan Perón. Through their work, they made political statements, evoking themes of social justice and liberation. Despite being inspired by how these two groups used “art as a way to make a better life”, Minoliti was frustrated by the male dominance of art in general. So, they turned to queer and feminist theory to influence their work. “I apply the theory to geometric abstraction so as to rethink, or try to break the binary, of human classification,” says Minoliti, who represented Argentina at the 2019 Venice Biennale. “Of course, abstraction and geometry shouldn’t have a gender, but I think art history is very male-dominated. And you can tell, it’s very strong … Modernity is rooted in a patriarchal repression of the feminine.” In contrast, Minoliti uses what they call “non-binary geometry”, which includes “all these values that modernism dismissed: the humour, the tenderness, but without being cynical”. Minoliti’s first solo show in the UK, Biosfera Peluche/Biosphere Plush, debuted at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead and now moves to Tate St Ives, Cornwall. In keeping with the peluche of the title (which means “teddy bear” in Spanish), Minoliti’s approach is playful. Bright murals adorn the walls, and standing around the room are human-like figures of no apparent gender that Minoliti calls “furries”, their heads inspired by animal toys. The exhibition is a critical exploration of the Biosphere 2 experiment of the early 90s, in which a group of eight men and women lived in isolation in the world’s largest closed ecological system: a three-acre complex of sealed geodesic domes and pyramids in the Arizona desert. With its forests, deserts and farm, the facility was originally designed to show how humans could survive in an artificial environment in outer space. But it didn’t work: as oxygen levels dropped, participants were left struggling to breathe; animals died; crops failed. For Minoliti, the story of Biosphere 2 highlights the capitalist and colonialist connotations of space exploration – all eight participants were white. Biosfera Peluche/Biosphere Plush, then, is Minoliti’s own biosphere, which, they say, “transforms this experiment into the opposite”: a universe that is “democratic, open and a safe space”. It also features the artist’s Feminist School of Painting, first exhibited at the Kadist gallery, San Francisco, in 2018, an active classroom that will be used to host painting workshops and discussions. The exhibition, Minoliti says, was conceived during the pandemic, in response to the rise of eco-fascism – a combination of authoritarian and environmentalist politics, often relating to immigration – both on social media and in the physical world. “Eco-fascism is also driven by white supremacy,” they explain. “So I wanted to make a statement against this idea of an apocalyptic future. Why can’t we think about other types of ending?” Ad Minoliti: Biosfera Peluche/Biosphere Plush is at Tate St Ives from 28 May to 30 October. “The works hanging on this tree are inspired by the character Sarah Kay [a series of cutesy drawings by Australian illustrator Vivien Kubbos]. I read that the media had been using Kay as propaganda for conservative women, [encouraging them] to go back to caretaking and not take to the streets. I wanted to redraw that gender role.” “The Feminist School of Painting [at the far end of the photo] is a big project in this idea of rethinking the white cube and the gallery and the traditional painting into something that is interactive and open to all backgrounds and ages. The Feminist School and the Biosphere Plush are set on cooperation.” “The palette of the murals – orange, green and violet – comes from activist movements here [in Argentina],” says Minoliti. “The green is referring to the feminist movement for legal abortion. The violet is also a colour that represents the Latin American feminist movement. The orange represents the protests against the church being in politics and the government.”",Arts/Art and design,The Argentine artist breaking barriers with ‘non-binary geometry’ – and furries,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/16/ad-minoliti-non-binary-geometry-and-furries
5/16/2022,"‘Sometimes the truth is messy and illogical,” says Anupama Chandrasekhar. “But theatre can display the truth in ways journalism or other nonfiction cannot. It’s not just the facts that people can struggle to understand – it is the enormity of things.” The playwright, who is based in Chennai, India, has spent the last 15 years examining just such uncomfortable truths, from 2007’s Free Outgoing, exploring the viral consequences of a sex tape, to 2019’s When the Crows Visit, which was partly inspired by the Delhi bus gang-rape of 2012. Her latest offering, The Father and the Assassin, tackles one of the formative moments in India’s history: the murder of Mahatma Gandhi. In true Chandrasekhar fashion, rather than focusing on the revered persona of Gandhi, she concentrates on his assassin, Hindu nationalist Nathuram Godse, seeking to get to the heart of his journey from avid follower of Gandhi’s doctrine of non-violence to killer. Although the assassination took place in 1948, Chandrasekhar decided to write about the era because its themes still felt startlingly relevant. “My job is to chronicle the changes that are happening in society,” she says, during a break from rehearsals at London’s National Theatre. “Over the last few years, Godse has entered political conversations in India.” In fact, Hindu nationalism has surged in the country, with statues and memorials erected to the assassin. “The divisiveness is so stark – there is no middle ground. I wanted to understand where this animosity against pluralism was coming from. Sometimes to understand the present, you have to go to the past.” Chandrasekhar paints a complex picture of Godse in the play, from his childhood raised as a girl in Pune by superstitious parents who feared another infant death, to his adulthood witnessing the brutal consequences of British rule as a journalist. Godse, played by Shubham Saraf, is on stage throughout the play – we witness this world through his eyes. Indhu Rubasingham, artistic director at London’s Kiln theatre, will direct the play, the fourth time the pair have worked together since first collaborating on Free Outgoing. “Anu talks about the unthinkable,” Rubasingham says, sitting beside the playwright. “She gets at the tension between personal individualism and the pressures of society – to the things we don’t want to speak about.” It feels pointed that this confrontation between the personal and political is taking place at the National – addressing the consequences of Partition in front of an audience likely made up of many of the British empire’s immigrant subjects. “It’s a fantastic opportunity, but also an opportunity to fuck up,” Rubasingham laughs. For Chandrasekhar, putting this play on in Britain also exposes the often-hidden aspects of the country’s history. “I didn’t realise there was a gap in the British education system about the empire until I came here,” she says. “I hope this work will speak to those audience members who have south Asian history, as well as enlighten others about the legacies of colonialism.” Just as Godse has been revived as a figurehead of Hindu nationalism, so recent years have seen a revisionism of Gandhi’s saintly status as the “father” of India. Questions have been raised around his practices of celibacy in later life, as well as his views on Black South Africans while living in the apartheid state. “I’m trying to sift through the mythology surrounding these figures to understand what goes into the brutal, dirty world of pre-independence India,” Chandrasekhar says. “I didn’t want any of the characters to be idols, since enough hagiographies have already been written. It’s 75 years since Indian independence and we should begin to treat these political figures like the human beings with flaws that they were.” Chandrasekhar mentions Richard Attenborough’s Oscar-winning 1982 film Gandhi as one touchstone to avoid. “My impetus was to move away from Attenborough and his style,” she says. “We’ve had enough of Gandhi’s story, but there’s so little known about Godse. I took what facts we have and fluffed them up with my own fictions to create this character. I let him go where he wanted to take me, since it was the journey leading to the assassination I needed to follow.” Rubasingham adds: “Anu creates this world on the cusp of change. The subject matter is so huge, you could write hundreds of plays on its themes. No one play can answer everything – this is Anu’s version of a particular moment.” Since Chandrasekhar has previously faced calls to moderate her controversial work, does she feel there is a risk in taking a nuanced view of a moment so symbolic to Indian national consciousness? “What I take from Gandhi is that bravery is something that can be practised,” she says. “I’m not the most courageous writer but I’m learning to be brave.” Ultimately, she sees the purpose of her work as fostering the empathic connections that were lacking in pre-independence India – and still are today. “I want the audience to learn to listen to each other,” she says. “To understand there is perhaps a kernel of truth in what the other person is saying. Without listening, we can descend into violence.” The Father and the Assassin is at the Olivier theatre, London, until 18 June.",Arts/Stage,"The celebrated assassin: the play about Gandhi’s killer, still dividing India",https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/16/celebrated-assassin-play-gandhis-killer-india-anupama-chandrasekhar-nathuram-godse
5/16/2022,"As Buffalo, New York, mourns the victims of a mass shooting at a supermarket Saturday that left 10 dead and three wounded, details are emerging about the shooter’s movements before the attack and how the devastating racist attack unfolded. The 18-year-old shooter, who is a self-confessed white supremacist, shot 11 Black and two white victims in a “racially motivated hate crime” authorities said. It plunged the mostly Black Buffalo East Side neighborhood into grief and shock. But the plotting of the attack happened many miles away, had likely been in development for months and even apparently involved a reconnaissance of the targeted area. The shooter is believed to have traveled about 200 miles (320km ) from his home of Conklin, New York, to Buffalo but signs of trouble had surrounded him for some time. One year ago, he was the subject of a law enforcement investigation, according to The Buffalo News. High school authorities in Broome county, New York called the police in June 2021, claiming that he had “threatened violence in comments made to fellow students”. “A school official reported that this very troubled young man had made statements indicating that he wanted to do a shooting, either at a graduation ceremony, or sometime after,” the newspaper reported, citing a government source. The state police were dispatched to investigate and he was referred for counseling and a mental health assessment. Officials have said that the shooter purchased his gun legally in New York. He did not purchase the high-capacity magazine in this state, they said. The purported shooter recently purchased a Bushmaster XM-15, an assault weapon in the style of an AR-15, from Vintage Firearms, a gun shop in Endicott, New York, the New York Times reported. Robert Donald, the store’s owner, told The Times that he conducted a background check on the alleged shooter, and that nothing turned up. “He didn’t stand out – because if he did, I would’ve never sold him the gun,” he told the newspaper. A lengthy racist manifesto surfaced online after the shooting, and the writer’s name matches that of the alleged shooter. The text indicated that the writer planned his steps “down to the minute”, including diagrams inside the Tops Friendly Market. This manifesto, the validity of which has not been confirmed by authorities, said that the supermarket was selected because the postal code had the highest percentage of Black people close to where he lived, WIVB reported. The author stated that he had considered such an attack for several years, but started planning in earnest this January. Meanwhile, police say that the shooter “was in the Buffalo area at least the day before”. “It seems that he had come here to scope out the area, to do a little reconnaissance work on the area before he carried out his just evil, sickening act,” Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said on This Week With George Stephanopoulos. Buffalo’s mayor, Byron Brown, further described the gunman’s alleged reconnaissance in an interview with CNN. “It sounds like he was here for maybe several days from reports that I’ve been hearing and that he did surveil this community, was scouting the supermarket, actually talked to some people in the area,” Brown said. The shooter arrived at Tops around 2.30pm, authorities said. He wore military garb and body armor, as well as a “tactical helmet”, according to ABC News. His rampage began in the store’s parking lot. Video shows him arriving at the store with a gun on the front seat. He then trained his gun on people in the parking lot, as he exited his vehicle, and started shooting. “He had a camera that he was livestreaming what he was doing,” police commissioner Gramaglia, told reporters. He shot four people outside the store, local prosecutors said. Three died. The gunman then entered the grocery. Aaron Salter, a recently retired Buffalo police department lieutenant, shot at the gunman in an attempt to stop him. While Salter was able to hit the shooter, he was protected by his tactical gear, authorities said. The shooter killed Salter. The gunman then shot eight more people inside of the grocery. Six died, and two were injured, prosecutors said. Four victims worked at the store, authorities said. Buffalo police arrived at the store and confronted the shooter inside the vestibule. “At that point the suspect put the gun to his own neck. Buffalo police personnel – two patrol officers – talked the suspect into dropping the gun. He dropped the gun, took off some of his tactical gear, surrendered at that point. And he was led outside, put in a police car,” Gramaglia said. The shooter appeared in court hours later, where he wore a white hospital gown. He was arraigned on one first-degree murder count, and was held without bail. He pleaded not guilty. Meanwhile, scores of law enforcement agents arrived at the shooter’s parents home, where he lived, hours after the shooting, according to WIVB. The shooter’s parents were cooperating with authorities.

5/16/2022,"One of the side-effects of ageing is the urge to garden, which, unfortunately, tends to rear its head just when your knees have turned into agonising swollen purple turnips. For me, decades of being unable to procreate has manifested itself in the desire to produce flowers. Preferably, I’d like to do this without ever reading a single instruction, either in a manual or on the back of a packet of seeds. I don’t want to do the homework; I just want to watch the miracles rise from the earth, thank you. This spring, I had such raging success with a tub of tulips – blooms of such beauty! – I was quite tempted to transport them up and down the street in a pram. But, inevitably, the flowers blew themselves inside out and dropped their petals. Such is nature. Rather than do some actual research, I turned to Twitter, asking: what should I do with my dead potted tulips? The answers came thick and fast and, in true Twitter style, the advice was split straight down the middle. Half my garden gurus instructed the removal of the bulbs from the pot. These bulbs (not to be confused with corms or tubers) should be dried, then kept somewhere dry and dark, preferably in a brown paper bag, until repotting season in September. The other 50% suggested doing bugger all. “Just leave them!” they cried. “If they’re going to come back next year, they’ll come back next year.” Gardeners, it seems, fall into two camps: those who really enjoy grunt work, and those who would rather do absolutely nothing, leaving it entirely to fate. Despite being very new to this game, I already know which group I fall into.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Anything that makes it into my garden is going to have to thrive on neglect | Jenny Eclair,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2022/may/16/you-can-be-a-great-gardener-without-lifting-a-finger-just-ask-my-friends-on-twitter
5/16/2022,"Iceland is under pressure to ban the production of a hormone extracted from pregnant horses, a practice that has been described as “cruel” and “animal abuse”.The hormone is used by farmers across the UK and Europe to increase reproduction in pigs, cows and other female farm animals. Pregnant Mare Serum Gonadotropin (PMSG) is extracted from pregnant horses in Iceland during the summer at “blood farms”, before being converted into powder and shipped around the world. Animal welfare campaigners in Iceland visiting farms with the Guardian showed broken restraint boxes and enclosures covered in bite marks, which they claimed was a sign of anxious horses. Undercover footage from farms, taken by animal welfare campaigners, also appeared to show distressed horses being hit and struggling in restraint boxes before blood was drawn using a large cannula inserted in their jugular vein. The European Commission said it was “seriously concerned” about the treatment of horses farmed for blood, while the European parliament has called for imports of the hormone to be banned. In late March, an international coalition of 17 NGOs submitted a complaint against Iceland to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Surveillance Authority (ESA), which monitors compliance with European Economic Area (EEA) rules in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The complaint accused Iceland of breaching EEA law on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes and said Icelandic authorities should ban blood collection. Support for a ban is also growing within Iceland. The opposition People’s party has put a bill through parliament calling for a ban. The bill, which is awaiting a vote, is supported by groups including the Icelandic Tourism Association. A working group, set up by Iceland’s Fisheries and Agriculture department is due to report its findings this summer. Experts have also expressed concern about the amount of blood taken from horses. The pharmaceutical company Isteka, which owns or subcontracts farms, said five litres of blood are taken from pregnant mares every week for eight consecutive weeks – around four times the amount specified on international guidelines. The Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authority (Mast), which granted Isteka a licence, said: “There is no indication that blood collection of five litres a week for up to eight weeks has a negative impact on the health and welfare of the mares or their foals.” Ingunn Reynisdóttir, a veterinarian who lives in north Iceland and has worked with horses all her life, disagreed. “It’s too much [blood] and if you take too much they are trembling and have difficulty walking,” she said. Mette Uldahl, vice-president of the Federation of Veterinarians of Europe (FVE), said of the practice: “It’s animal abuse and it’s cruelty. You shouldn’t use untrained horses because they get too scared.” Iceland is home to about 80,000 Icelandic horses, 5,383 of which are used as “blood mares”. There are 119 blood farms operating in the country. Blood farms are believed to have been operating in Iceland for about 40 years, but Icelanders who spoke to the Guardian said they had little knowledge of them until last November, when the Animal Welfare Foundation undercover video was shown on television. A survey in December found most of the population was opposed to the blood farms. “I didn’t have a clue we were doing this here and I was shocked when I saw it,” said Bjarnheiður Hallsdóttir, chair of the Icelandic Travel Industry Association. “It [is] awful.” “I would like people to know that Iceland is actually stabbing semi-wild pregnant mares, taking their blood in extreme volumes and frequency, just to … make pigs have more pigs,” said Rósa Líf Darradóttir, a medical doctor and horse owner in Reykjavik. In Germany, 6.4m single doses of PMSG – the equivalent of about 32,000 litres of blood – were given to sows between 2016 and 2019, according to the federal ministry of food and agriculture. PMSG can be obtained legally in the UK from a registered vet, with products available including vaginal sponges for sheep, which induce early lambing, with advertised benefits such as producing lambs “at the optimum time for autumn sales”. A spokesperson said the EU commission believes dialogue with non-EU countries is crucial to “bringing positive change on animal welfare issues”. “The EU cannot impose its animal welfare standards in third countries and our trade policy has to respect the rules of the World Trade Organization. For this reason, the commission continues to address the importance of improving the welfare conditions of horses involved in the production of PMSG at multilateral level in the framework of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE).” Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

5/16/2022,"The New South Wales premier, Dominic Perrottet, says it will be “difficult” for first-home buyers to enter Sydney’s housing market using the federal government’s proposed superannuation access policy. While Perrottet, who has made addressing housing affordability a key priority for his government, said he welcomed the Coalition’s proposal to allow first-home buyers to access to up to $50,000 of their superannuation to buy a property, he acknowledged it would be of little help for many people. “For some it will help, for others it will not,” he said. Perrottet said he did not believe the government’s policy would drive up home prices. But with Sydney’s median home value above $1m, and the average superannuation balance for people being aged between 25 and 34 being about $41,000 for men and $31,000 for women, he agreed housing affordability would not be solved by allowing access to 40% of retirement savings. “Yeah, it’s going to be difficult,” he said. “And that’s why this proposal, whilst it’s welcome, can’t operate in isolation. I don’t believe one initiative is going to solve this problem.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Perrottet last week used a press conference with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to welcome Labor’s proposed home-equity scheme – which the Coalition has sought to criticise – saying he was open to “new ways of thinking” on housing affordability. On Monday he gave the Coalition’s policy the same treatment, saying “we should at least give it a go and see what the take up is”. “Superannuation is incredibly important, but let’s not forget the scheme was set up at a time when we had a much higher rate of home ownership in this country,” he said. “The best way in which, particularly, young people grow their wealth is purchasing their first home. It makes a lot of sense I think, to do this in a measured way. We can’t have an Australia which can’t house its children.” But he also called on both parties to make housing “above politics”, calling for both state and federal governments to embrace “fair dinkum” tax reform to address the issue. “We need a suite of measures,” he said. “We can’t just tackle this with one-out policy – Albanese one out, Morrison one out, NSW government one out. We have to work together to get a better outcome.” Perrottet has long pushed for state stamp duty to be abolished in favour of an annual land tax, but the proposal has been slow-moving. On Monday he called stamp duty “the worst tax of all taxes”, but said NSW needed commonwealth help to reform it, given it contributes about $9bn to the state budget. “It is the biggest impediment not just to first-home buyers getting into the property market, but also transferring their property,” he said, but added that “it funds our teachers, our nurses, our police officers”. “States can’t embrace structural reform on their own. We need greater collaboration with the federal government.” The government’s proposed scheme would allow people to access up to $50,000 of superannuation savings, or 40% of the total balance, for the purchase of a first home. People would have to have saved a 5% deposit for the home already, and would have to return the invested amount as well as a share of capital gains back into their superannuation if the property was sold. The policy has been criticised in a number of quarters, including the superannuation scheme’s architect, former Labor prime minister Paul Keating, who said the policy showed the Liberal party did not believe in the scheme. “They object to working Australians having wealth in retirement independent of the government,” he said after the policy was announced.",News/Australia news,Dominic Perrottet downplays Coalition’s bid for first-home buyers to access superannuation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/dominic-perrottet-downplays-coalitions-bid-for-first-home-buyers-to-access-superannuation
5/16/2022,"Halyna Vasylivna lives alone in a tiny “Khrushchevka” flat. At 94, she has outlived her sons and her husband, and her grandchildren live outside the city. Her apartment, named after the Soviet leader under whom the five-storey buildings in Kyiv’s Podil district were built, is too far from the bunker so she hides in her pantry during airstrikes. Vasylivna is grateful for her social worker Olya’s visits a few times a week. She wishes she did not live alone. “It’s important to have someone who can listen to you,” she says. Vasylivna is one of 2 million older women in Ukraine who have remained largely invisible to authorities. Most of Ukraine’s elderly people are women – they make up two-thirds of those aged over 65 and 71% of those aged above 75 – partly because Ukraine has the sixth highest proportion of women in the world. These women are reliant on tiny state pensions (Vasylivna’s is about £130 a month), and require support from social services, charities and international institutions. They have become the group most likely to be alone, whether through mobility issues, bereavement or a reluctance to leave familiar surroundings. The lucky few get help; many do not. Ukraine’s health and social care system was already under pressure before Russia invaded in February. Despite progress through reforms, including decentralisation that allowed regional institutions to allocate budgets locally, an overstretched and underfunded health system is again in crisis. Ukraine’s expenditure on healthcare has declined from 7.8% of GDP in 2015 to 7.1% in 2019 (the last available data). The world average was 9.8% in 2019. Now the country is experiencing a humanitarian crisis, with dozens of accounts of rape and murder of Ukrainian elderly women – the biggest group left behind, of those allowed to leave, and least able to escape. In Kyiv’s Holosiyevo district, there are 786 elderly people – 80% of them women like Vasylivna – alone, unable to leave their homes, and without relatives to care for them. Since Russia attacked, the number of social workers in the local centre has collapsed by more than 75%. Those women who remain are mostly elderly themselves, and now have four times as many clients to look after. They work five days a week, earning about £170 a month to supplement their small state pensions. “We need to support both our elderly clients and ourselves,” says 65-year-old social worker Nataliya Bodnar. Social centre manager, Oksana Ruban, says they have faced multiple challenges. “Public transport was closed, the curfew lasted sometimes up to several days, shops closed, too. We had to make sure all of our clients were taken care of by someone – if not relatives or us, at least by neighbours or volunteers. We all worked relentlessly.” The situation for older people is particularly acute in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions where a survey of more than 1,500 over-60s conducted in March revealed the scale of the problem: 99% do not want to leave their homes; 91% need help to get food; 91% are also experiencing extreme cold, with no heating due to electricity cuts; 75% need basic hygiene items; and 34% need urgent medication for chronic illness. These needs are exacerbated by a shortage of vital medicines and Russia destroying healthcare facilities. “I wonder why some young people evacuate their cats and hamsters, but leave their parents behind,” says Roman Vodyanyk, head doctor at Severodonetsk hospital in Luhansk, the only functioning hospital left in the city. With no water, gas or electricity in Severodonetsk, Vodyanyk has turned the hospital, which has more than 50 patients, into a humanitarian hub, providing hot food, wifi and medical support. About 220 patients have left in the past month, but many elderly people have no desire to evacuate, with nowhere to go and no one to care for them. “How do you evacuate a hospital in this situation? How do you leave them all behind?” asks Vodyanyk. So despite the shelling and along with local authorities, NGOs and volunteers, he is not leaving either. Elderly people are often the forgotten category in any humanitarian crisis – an analysis of Google news search keywords between 24 February and 22 April found that 97% of all Ukraine-headlined articles focused on children. Only 3% mentioned elderly people, of which only three touched on elderly women. Despite there being more than 50% more retirees in Ukraine than children under 15, the 390 UK NGOs operating in Ukraine are nearly twice as likely to be helping children than elderly people, According to Justin Derbyshire, CEO of HelpAge International, the problem is global: elderly patients’ specific needs are neglected by governments and international bodies during and after wars. “This is systemic ageism and an example of how bad the global system is at responding to older people’s needs.” Elderly people, such as Vasylivna and Bodnar, are at the centre of the crisis in Ukraine, as victims and rescuers. After a lifetime of looking after others, they are now vulnerable, not only to loneliness and hunger, but also to rape and murder. “I’ve seen everything – the Holodomor [great famine of 1932-33], the second world war, so many horrors. What else could scare me?” says Vasylivna. She never imagined Russia would invade. It is her inability to take care of herself that scares her now. She feels trapped. “I would evacuate if I could take care of myself. I was working my whole life. It’s such a shame I can’t do anything any more.” Sign up for a different view with our Global Dispatch newsletter – a roundup of our top stories from around the world, recommended reads, and thoughts from our team on key development and human rights issues, delivered to your inbox every two weeks:",News/Global development,Alone under siege: how older women are being left behind in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/16/alone-under-siege-how-older-women-are-being-left-behind-in-ukraine

Don’t knock innumeracy; my girlfriend is innumerate and we have wonderful threesomes. These one-liners are hand-picked classics from Des MacHale, a legend in the world of mathematical humour. Emeritus professor of maths at University College, Cork, he is the author of more than 70 books, mostly of maths, puzzles and jokes. MacHale has selected today’s puzzles, below. The first four are standard word or number conundrums, while the remaining five are lateral thinking puzzles, a MacHale speciality and a crowd-pleasing genre I feature too infrequently in this column. Some require you to think like a novelist, conjuring up a believable situation that results in the relevant scenario. Others are misleading you by presenting a word or phrase that can be interpreted in more than one way. Take note. 1. A rich woman dies and leaves her entire fortune of two million pounds between a number of lion tamers. How much did each lion tamer receive? 2. Punctuate this sentence to reverse its meaning: A SMART DOG KNOWS ITS MASTER. 3. What is never odd or even? 4. Make this equation correct just by moving the digits about: 26 = 74. 5. Two objects perform the same task. One has many thousands of moving parts while the other has no moving parts. What are they? 6. Why did a person buy an object they didn’t want for £1 and throw it away a few minutes later? 7. Why did a man tighten the lids on all the jars in his house and put them in the fridge? 8. In a locked cabin high up on the side of a mountain, five dead bodies are found. How had they all died? 9. Why was a person standing at a bus stop with an ordinary kitchen chair in their arms? I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS! Instead, please discuss your favourite lateral thinking puzzles and post your favourite mathematical jokes. Des MacHale is an algebraist, with more than 100 academic papers in refereed journals. Yet he gained fame early in his career as a humorist. In 1976 he wrote the Book of Kerryman Jokes, which went on to sell half a million copies in Ireland. He has written many other joke books, including a compendium of Boris Johnson jokes. His prolific output also includes four books on the Irish mathematician George Boole, and many books of puzzles. MacHale’s two main interests – maths and humour – merge in his most recent book, Comic Sections Plus, an updated edition of his classic book of mathematical wit. “I would have humour lessons in all schools,” he says. “Logic and riddles are basic links between mathematics and humour; mathematics is ultra logical and humour turns logic on its head.” His 20 books of lateral thinking puzzles are co-written with Paul Sloane. “I am hopeless at solving them but good I think at making them up,” he says. “Everybody enjoys logical thinking and being the first to get a solution.” On that note, how are you all getting on…?

5/16/2022,"Q I bought my first house last year for £240,000. However, my personal circumstances have changed and I have been thinking about looking for a new job. I work in a niche industry where vacancies don’t arise too often and I would probably have to relocate if I changed employer. Given the current talk of recession, I’m terrified that if I find a new job later this year or next year, my house value will have fallen. If I let it out, the rent would just cover the mortgage and the tax to pay would be quite hefty. Should I sell now and move into rented accommodation with the view to moving in the next year or so to avoid falling into negative equity?AN A Judging by the various expert predictions of what will happen to house prices over the rest of 2022, the chances of your falling into negative equity are slim. For you to be in negative equity, the value of your house would have to fall to below that of your outstanding mortgage. So if you took out a mortgage last year for 90% of its £240,000 purchase price, the value of your house would have to fall to £216,000 for negative equity to be a potential problem. Even the most pessimistic prediction of future house prices – from Halifax – does not predict falling house prices but suggests that at worst prices will not move or at best will rise by 2%. So I think it is safe for you to sit tight and wait until you have a firm job offer and know for certain where you will be moving to.",Lifestyle/Money,Should I sell my house now to avoid falling into negative equity?,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/16/sell-my-house-negative-equity-relocate
5/16/2022,"“I just feel like everyone tries to do something different but you all wind up doing the same damn thing.” When these words were uttered by Richard in Alex Garland’s novel The Beach – and in the film adaptation by a young Leonardo DiCaprio 22 years ago – no one realised just how prophetic they were. The novel’s protagonist was talking about the trap backpackers like him fall into when travelling around Thailand: all visiting the same sites, from Bangkok’s Khao San Road and the 46-metre reclining gold buddha at Wat Pho temple to full-moon parties on Ko Samui. He decides to do “something different”, and so begins a journey to find a secret island idyll. Little did the filmmakers realise they were about to add that location to the tourist bucket list and see its popularity explode. The film location for the fictional limestone-fringed paradise Richard discovers was an island called Phi Phi Leh. Until Hollywood came, few people knew about it, and even fewer visited. But after the film’s success, it became the island every daytripper wanted to visit, and they flocked in their millions – up to 6,000 tourists a day – from resorts such as Phuket, Krabi and Ko Phi Phi. “We just weren’t prepared for that many tourists,” said my guide Suree Pongnopparat Ka as we made our way by longtail boat towards the island from the Zeavola Resort, seven miles to the north on Ko Phi Phi. “The whole bay was consistently packed with speedboats, and you couldn’t even see the sand on the beach there were so many people.” In 2018, faced with mounting piles of rubbish, disappearing wildlife (on land and in the water) and dead coral (about 90% was estimated to be have been destroyed through misplaced boat anchors, unwitting swimmers and chemicals in their sunscreen), the Thai authorities decided to act. Despite opposition from local tour operators, (in 2018 the location was estimated to generate about 400 million baht – £9.5m – in revenue a year), the authorities closed the beach, initially for a period of four months. Working with conservationists and environmentalists, they extended this for a further year. And just when it was rumoured the bay would finally reopen, Covid hit, meaning it was closed to tourists for nearly four years in total. “The pandemic restrictions actually came at a good time for the bay,” said Siriwat Suebsai, a forestry technical officer who is overseeing the reopening of the beach. We met on the island’s new floating dock on Loh Sama Bay – on the opposite side of the island to the famous Maya Bay beach. “It allowed time for further recovery: having no one here made a big difference.” Less than six months after the beach closed, black-tipped reef sharks, which had formerly used the sheltered cove as a nursery ground, began to return in modest numbers; now, after several years of no disturbance, they are back in their hundreds. Conservationists had time and space to repair and plant nearly 30,000 fragments of coral, which has already bloomed and is attracting a myriad reef of fish; and a rare Puu Kai crab (not spotted for more than 10 years) has even paid the bay a visit. Human visitors, however, don’t have quite the same freedom of movement as before. The first change is the pier – not only is it well away from Maya Bay, but only eight boats at a time can dock, and they can stay no more than an hour. Booking a one-hour time slot on an app or via a tour operator (it’s open 10am-4pm) is also now essential. No more than 375 people can visit at one time, which is still a lot, but the authorities say it is sustainable. Leaving the boat, we walked on newly constructed boardwalks between two towering rocks, past a visitor information booth and into thick jungle. “We built the boardwalk to keep people off the vegetation, which had been badly destroyed,” said Siriwat. Before, there would have been no buildup to spying the mythical sands of Maya Bay, just an ungracious rev up to the sand in a speedboat. Thanks to this new pathway, I felt as if I’d walked into the pages of the book, following in Richard’s footsteps. The anticipation was palpable, and though other people were walking there too, it wasn’t the throngs I’d seen in pre-2018 photographs. Eventually I emerged through fringing palm trees into a clearing and … a huge sign with a list of rules to follow: no littering, no drones, no boats and – crucially – no swimming. One woman, though, was desperate to post a photo of herself in the water on social media. But with a shrill whistle Siriwat’s team leapt into action and, shamefaced, the woman left the water and sulked back to the sand. I asked Siriwat how tourists had taken to the new rules. “In the old days we focused on increasing tourism so much that we forgot what was important,” he said. “We have to protect these areas. Now that we’ve learned that lesson and made changes, it’s important we keep going on the same track no matter what. We’ve gone back to basics and put nature first. And if nature is good, the tourists will come anyway.” I looked out to the beach – at its sand as soft and white as flour, its fortress of limestone towers covered with vegetation so green it looked like it had already been put through an Instagram filter – and couldn’t help but agree. I walked further, leaving my guides behind – and within five minutes had left all the other tourists, too. Even on this the most-visited beach in Thailand, it seemed I could, for about 40 minutes at least, enjoy my own little slice of paradise. At the end of the film, Richard reflects: “Of course, you can never forget what you’ve done. But we adapt. We carry on.” Let’s hope that here in Maya Bay, with these lessons learned and new initiatives in place, his words once again prove prescient.

5/16/2022,"Kash Patel, a former Republican aide on the House intelligence committee who Donald Trump weighed installing as deputy CIA director, is publishing a children’s book on Monday that perpetuates the false claim the Steele dossier sparked investigations into Russian collusion. The book features characters such as “King Donald” and his enemy “Hillary Queenton”. In the book, titled “The Plot Against the King” and set to be published by Brave Books, Patel repeats Trump’s false claim that the FBI began investigating links between his campaign and Russia based on a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British spy. The 35-page tome, complete with an epilogue that details Donald Trump’s false claims about the FBI inquiry, bizarrely uses the tool of children’s fictional characters to provide a revisionist account of the probe that dogged the first two years of the Trump presidency and eventually led to a special counsel investigation. Over the course of the book, the narrative lionises Patel and depicts him as a wizard who supposedly shows how “the King” Trump was wrongly accused of “cheating” to take the throne. The book claims the king was accused of cheating by a “shifty knight” – a reference to the Democratic chair of the intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, who claims to have a “paper” from a “steel” box attesting to wrongdoing. But Patel writes that he then found evidence that the slug “Keeper Komey” – a reference to former FBI director James Comey – put slugs in the “steel” box at the behest of “Hillary Queenton”, who was also vying for the throne – a reference to Clinton. The wizard Patel then proclaims to the kingdom, the book says, that “the king, King Donald, is innocent” and “did not work with the Russonians” – a reference to Russia – and “Hillary wrote that paper and had her sneaky slugs slide into the steel box”. In reality the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign after a foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, told an Australian diplomat that Russia had political “dirt” on Hillary Clinton ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The information in the Steele Dossier did not reach FBI officials involved in the investigation until almost a year after the 2016 election, and even the then-Republican House intelligence committee for which Patel worked found no evidence for Trump’s claim. But the illustrated children’s book authored by Patel, a pre-publication copy of which the Guardian received unsolicited, makes no mention of that conclusion, or an additional memo stating conclusively that the FBI investigation did not originate with the Steele Dossier. Patel enjoyed a rapid rise from an obscure staffer on the Republican staff of the House intelligence committee after he endorsed Trump’s false claims that the FBI wiretapped Trump’s phones and was eventually promoted to chief of staff at the Department of Defense.",News/US news,Former Trump official Kash Patel writes children’s book repeating false claim over Steele dossier,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/16/former-trump-official-kash-patel-writes-childrens-book-repeating-false-claim-over-steele-dossier
5/16/2022,"I have a job which often requires me to eat more than a human being probably should; 2,000 calories in one meal is quite normal – lots of butter, sugar, fat, cream – all the things that make things taste delicious. I realised early on in this game that I could only do it if I ate quite sparsely the rest of the time. I really watch what I put into my body now. I’ve realised that, from your mid-40s, everything you eat and drink shows in your face. You become hammered on a G&T and feel awful after a late-night Burger King. I went teetotal about nine months ago. I had been drinking in a very British way since I was 14. I wouldn’t have said I had an alcohol problem– I didn’t binge or drink secretly – but I began as a teenager in a field, then moved on to student bars, dinner parties, the media industry, and then to reviewing restaurants where endless drinks are on offer. I grew sick of losing bits of life to feeling shit. So I just stopped completely. My skin looked radically different right away. When I go out now, I usually have a shrub or booze-free aperitif. I skip breakfast a lot – often, it’s just a litre of coffee with oat milk – and I eat lots of protein at lunch, eggs in any form, a block of tofu I’ll have marinated and baked, lots of nuts and dried fruit. And I roast loads of vegetables: broccoli is a favourite. I eat like a wild animal – apart from the meat. I drive my man mad. His idea of joy is cooking half a cow three different ways. I’m more of an ape; I love vegan food. Whenever I talk about loving vegan food, it starts a backlash. The vegans aren’t happy with me because I’m not fully vegan and the meat eaters say I’m trying to destroy the farming industry. Any nuance seems to get lost. It does seem to fascinate people, though, that I’m a food critic who doesn’t love foie gras. Stereotypically, those guys love a kidney, bone marrow, sweetbreads. Not me. One of the reasons I have trouble with meat is I’m a massive animal lover. My dream is to go full Celia Hammond and have a little animal sanctuary, at which point I will stop wearing a bra and ditch the false eyelashes. I am uncomfortable with killing animals. My freezer always has veggie burgers in it. I don’t think you should eat them every day, but they’re really handy. I don’t get the anger about Linda McCartney-style foods – there are far worse things. People ask: “Why do you want a burger if it’s not a burger?” But what don’t they understand? When you have a beef burger, you don’t just want the patty – you want the lovely bun and the butter and the sauce and the chips and the salad. Who cares what the patty is, as long as it tastes peppery and herby and has that mouthfeel? There are a few go-to cookbooks on my shelves. I love Nigel Slater because his recipes are more like suggestions: he ruminates rather than prescribes. And I bloody love Nigella; How to Be a Domestic Goddess is my most destroyed book. Also Ottolenghi Simple, Emma Spitzer’s Fress, which is full of bright, bold Jewish flavours, and Cooking Like Mummyji by Vicky Bhogal. This book taught me how to make Indian food with everyday British ingredients. When I eat out or get takeaway, I usually go for spice. I order loads from Wanstead Kitchen, an Indian cafe near where I live, which I hope I don’t regret telling you about (one Christmas Day, when I was working on Radio 2, I had a massive Hyderabadi biryani and iftari kala chana, a black chickpea curry, from them – heaven). You’ll often see me in the Wagamama in Westfield Stratford during the day, eating bang bang cauliflower, which is one of the hottest things on a mainstream British menu. And Tonkotsu: I love their ramen, and I really love Eat the Bits, their chilli sauce, which I’ve taken to eating simply with bread and butter. The British palate has veered towards chilli sauce en masse. It’s become bog-standard to crave a blast of it. Ten years ago, ketchup was the condiment in every shopping trolley, but I think the likes of Blue Dragon sweet chilli sauce and sriracha are up there now. British communities come together in unity through some foods. I grew up eating very simply. I lived in Currock, a suburb of Carlisle, in a little terraced house. Food was whatever came from the tiny supermarket down the road. My mum did cook – hotpots, stews, fairy cakes – but my most exciting meals were tinned. I still feel the love from a tin of macaroni cheese, ravioli, baked beans. I have strong memories of coming home from school and watching Pipkins with half a tin of Heinz tomato soup and some white bread toast spread with Dairylea. Absolute happiness. When I moved to London, I lived in Bounds Green. I was surrounded by Greek and Turkish restaurants along Myddleton Road, proper Irish pubs, Korean and Vietnamese food, neither of which I’d known existed. It was like I’d only seen the world in black and white until that point. It was the food that kept me in London. The house prices are good in Carlisle but you can’t get very good sushi. I used to read Winner’s Dinners in the Sunday Times and think: “I could do that.” People like me didn’t really review restaurants, though, and I didn’t have an in. But from my early days in London, I loved the different scenes in restaurants and when people asked me what a place was like, I’d tell them to pull up a chair. They’d know exactly what I was talking about from my explanation. I can’t say I learned my love of food from childhood holidays in Tuscany, but I know people liked hearing from me on the matter. I’ve spent the last few months eating my way around the British coastline with Ainsley Harriott. In each place we visited, we sampled the whole spectrum of the food on offer. One moment I was eating in an Agatha Christie-style hotel, the next Ainsley and I were loading sugar into a giant machine to make rhubarb and custard sweets. It reminded me how much I love Great Britain, blustery beaches and seaside food. Because what’s better than being on an isolated beach and eating chips cooked in beef dripping from a kiosk?

5/16/2022,"Marian Elliott was 22 when she left the family home to be with her husband-to-be. So when he left her nearly 40 years later – shortly after her 60th birthday – she found herself living entirely alone for the first time. Elliott had thought she could picture the next stage in her life. She and her ex had worked hard to pay off their mortgage. “We were about to enjoy our retirement together,” she says with a heavy sigh. Now there was nothing but uncertainty. “I felt such pain, I didn’t know what to do with it,” she says. For Elliott, “a marriage broken up by the other person is like a bereavement”, and the grief she felt revived another sorrow that she had been unable fully to face. When she was 20, her father died of stomach cancer. “I have suffered from depression ever since,” she says. “It doesn’t take much, and whoosh! – it all comes back.” Her father was unaware that his illness was terminal, though Elliott knew, and she never had a chance to say goodbye, nor to share a “meaningful conversation” with him before he died. Within a year, her then boyfriend also died of stomach cancer. “There’s only so much you can talk about in terms of grief at that age, I think. People don’t know what to do with you,” she says. It was in this context that she became friends with the man who would become her husband. It was only after her marriage ended that Elliott embarked on counselling, at the suggestion of her doctor, and began to understand her bouts of depression. “You kind of bury these things. It does help, understanding where all this comes from.” When she first set up her marital home, her overwhelming sensation was of “freedom”. She hand-sewed kaftans for herself and her partner, cooked what she wanted to eat, and together they hung wallpaper and built bookshelves. But when she bought her own place for the first time at 64, and moved from Surrey to the Kent coast, she had to face a totally new kind of freedom, one that was offset by a solitary responsibility and sometimes acute loneliness. In her despair, she reached for some positives. “I thought: ‘I’ve always wanted to be by the sea,’” she says, and now she was. And she was finally able to get the dog she had long wanted. One of her greatest joys is walking Ruby, her rescue lurcher/collie cross, along the beach. “We like that,” she says. “It’s been nine years since all this started falling apart. And I come home and I look at my front door and think: ‘That is my front door. No one can take that away from me, ever.’ On the other hand, once I’m through the door, I am on my own and that is still hard.” She already knew of u3a – AKA the University of the Third Age, whose motto is “learn, laugh, live” – but she had always been too busy to sign up. Now, she looked up her local branch. “I knew I needed people. They have somebody on the door. If you look a bit lost, they say: ‘Have you been here before? Oh, I’ll sit you down with somebody’ … By the time you walk out of that first session, it’s like you’ve been there for ever. “Your confidence builds up. You get to walk through another door. A bit worried, but you do it.” Now, Elliott attends the Spanish, family history, creative writing and gardening groups (most of her new flower bed has been stocked with the help of her “generous and kind-hearted” friends); she also sits on the committee, organises AGMs and hosts coffee mornings. Life is not how she envisaged it nine years ago, but her new friends “are showing me that there is still lots for me to enjoy and do. They have enabled me, through their friendliness, to make a new life all by myself. And that’s quite an empowering feeling.” u3a is a national learning organisation in which people come together to develop their interests, make new friends and have fun.

5/16/2022,"The expansion of an iron ore mine in the Arctic that would have increased shipping and led to the “complete extirpation of narwhal” from the region has been blocked. After four years of consultations and deliberations, the Nunavut Impact Review Board rejected a request from Baffinland Iron Mines Corp asking to significantly increase mining on the northern tip of Baffin Island in Nunavut, Canada. The area is home to one of the world’s richest iron ore deposits, and the densest narwhal population in the world. The news came as a surprise and a relief to conservationists and community members working to protect the narwhal population and the Inuit who rely on them for subsistence. “I actually cried,” said Chris Debicki, a vice-president and counsel at the conservation organisation Oceans North. “The case against expansion at this moment was too strong and community opposition was too loud.” The review board issued a statement on Friday saying that the Mary River mine expansion project carried potential for “significant and lasting negative effects on marine mammals, the marine environment, fish, caribou and other terrestrial wildlife, vegetation and freshwater”. “In the Board’s view, these negative effects could also impact Inuit harvesting, culture, land use and food security,” it said. Dan Vandal, Canada’s northern affairs minister, can now decide whether to side with the review board or with Baffinland. He is expected to make his decision within the next three months. Baffinland’s CEO, Brian Penney, said in a brief online statement that the company was “surprised and disappointed” in the review board’s report and recommendations, and that he urged “the federal government to consider all of the evidence and input and to approve the Phase 2 application with fair and reasonable conditions”. Baffinland is jointly owned by ArcelorMittal and the Houston private equity firm the Energy and Minerals Group. Its expansion bid sought to increase shipping from the current 6m tonnes of iron ore a year to 12m from its north Baffin Island port at Milne Inlet. It also wanted to build a second railway to another port, from which it intended to ship an additional 18m tonnes. Current shipping volumes have already had a “devastating” impact on the narwhal population, said Enookie Inuarak, vice-chairperson of the Mittimatalik Hunters and Trappers Organization. Narwhals are a type of whale recognisable by the long, spear-like tusk that protrudes from its head. The animal is an important predator in Eclipse Sound and other Arctic waters, as well a major food source for Inuit in the region. Inuarak said generations of hunters have relied on narwhal hunting in the summer, when thousands of narwhal typically come to Eclipse Sound. Because narwhal meat is rich in vitamin C, it helps keep community members healthy during the round-the-clock darkness of winter. Last summer, hunters found barely any narwhals. “We rely on narwhals for diet, for health and also economically,” Inuarak said, adding that their growing absence from the region “means less of everything”. Since Baffinland began mining operations at Mary River in 2015, the number of narwhal has precipitously declined, according to Arctic marine biologist Kristin Westdal. “If you look at the surveys [since 2014], you see this incredible, statistically significant decline in the narwhal population in this area – we see 12,000, 10,000, 5,000, 2,000,” Westdal said. Because narwhals use underwater echolocation to communicate with each other, the noise and interference from mining transport ships is forcing them out of the area. Inuarak said Friday’s ruling would lead to celebrations in Pond Inlet, a community near the mine, including a small parade, but he said the threat remains. The final decision on the future of the mine’s operations rests with the federal government. Many supporters wanted the expansion because it came with promises of royalties and jobs. But Debicki said the review board’s rejection was significant. “This iron ore deposit is one of the best in the world because of its high concentration,” he said. “The reality is that there’ll be mining in this region not for tens of years, but likely for hundreds of years, so it’s super important to get the development right at the outset.”",News/World news,Rejection of Arctic mine expansion bid offers hope for narwhal population,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/arctic-mine-expansion-rejection-narwhal-canada
5/16/2022,"In 1907, Ella Gwendoline (“Gwen”) Rees Williams sailed to England from Dominica, the Caribbean island of her birth, to attend school in Cambridge. Gwen, who was 16, had long dreamed of the motherland, but from the moment she landed at Southampton, her mood began to darken. If London, her first stop, was sooty and drab and populated by permanently indignant landladies, school was little better. She was mocked for her lilting accent by her classmates, who took particular pleasure in the fact that the maniac who is Mrs Rochester in Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre was a white Creole just like her. On Saturdays, she would cycle to the house of a kindly great aunt. Even there, though, the atmosphere was cautionary. Her aunt told her that she’d once been planning to leave her husband for a lover – until, that is, she looked in the mirror and saw the devil leering over her shoulder. Did the devil ever perch on Gwen’s shoulder? Read Miranda Seymour’s slyly compelling new biography of Jean Rhys – the pen name was adopted in 1924, at the behest of her patron, Ford Madox Ford – and you will feel that it surely did, usually more than once a year. Unlike her aunt, however, she was not one to turn from temptation. The author of Voyage in the Dark and Good Morning, Midnight was all feeling: a human bagatelle ball whizzing from one crisis to another, lured not only by all the usual siren songs (men, money, booze), but by any number of other, less appealing tunes (“disaster is her element,” said her last editor, Diana Athill). Was she, to use the old word, mad? Sometimes, perhaps. But if so, she was hardly alone. I Used to Live Here Once – the biography takes its brilliantly apt title from one of Rhys’s ghost stories – is shot through with madness. Half its cast are half crazy, and most of the rest are as creepy as hell. Liars and fraudsters, bigamists and bolters, grifters and gropers: they’re all here, though Seymour has a special line (because her subject attracted them) in the kind of literary stalker whose pulse races furtively at the sight of an old woman with a bad wig, a whisky habit and (just perhaps) a half-finished manuscript in a drawer. The die for all this was cast in Rhys’s childhood on the island that inspired her 1966 Jane Eyre prequel, Wide Sargasso Sea. By then a British colony, of its population of 29,000, fewer than 100 were white (her mother, who whipped her until she was 12, was Creole; her father was a Welshman), and she always felt like an outsider, “a changeling, a ghostly revenant”. Dominica was not an entirely hospitable place for a girl like her, taunted on the streets, felt up at home. Voodoo was practised, and Rhys’s nursemaid spoke of zombies that could open any door – stories that foreshadow the final years of her life when, figuratively speaking, reanimated corpses were indeed all around, and she was persecuted as a witch by the children in her Devon village. After school, she became an actor; she once played a hen, laying her egg to the disconcerting thump of the clogs of the dissatisfied miners watching. But her lack of talent meant that she was soon in need of a protector. Lancelot Grey Hugh Smith set her up in a flat, and later paid for an abortion. But if he was never going to marry her, those who eventually did were never going to be as reliable as him. Her Belgian first husband, Jean Lenglet, married her bigamously. Her second, Leslie Tilden-Smith, died suddenly. Her third, Max Hamer, was sent to prison for fraud. Rhys had two children with Lenglet. The first, a son, died as a baby while she was out drinking. The second, a daughter, was at first sent by her broke, itinerant parents to an orphanage. Meanwhile, the poky, rat-infested places she called home – suburban bungalows with deceptively charming names – grew ever worse and so did her behaviour. She slapped other tenants, shouted antisemitic insults and abused the kindness of those who cared for her. All this is exhausting to read about: quite how she managed to write anything at all is a mystery. But somehow, she did. Rhys’s career divides in two. Encouraged by Ford, with whom she had an affair, she published her first novel, Quartet, in 1928. Others followed, but after dismal reviews for Good Morning, Midnight in 1939, she was silent for 30 years. She was only saved by her ardent fans: Francis Wyndham, then working at Andre Deutsch, and his colleague, Diana Athill, who between them – with assistance from a priest who’d previously been chaplain to an asylum – teased Wide Sargasso Sea out of her. Some readers will relish it when Rhys is to be found in Paris, hanging out with notable bohemians. But it’s the second half of the book, in which she is old and “potty” and half-cut, that is Seymour’s triumph. The narrative has the tension of a thriller as Rhys struggles to finish Wide Sargasso Sea, and once she has been rediscovered, there are the shabby hotels she haunts; the jaunts with Sonia Orwell and Diana Melly; the literary hangers-on who call for tea. Here is the poet Al Alvarez flirting with her, and here is the memoirist David Plante preparing to stitch her up (the portrait of a sodden Rhys in his book Difficult Women is among the most chilling things I’ve ever read). You cannot work her out: the violent ingratitude, the fondness for Ronnie Corbett, the fact that she has read George Moore’s dreadful 1894 novel Esther Waters 60 times. And yet Seymour does not make the mistake of portraying her as a victim (Rhys died in 1979, aged 88). However precarious her existence, as she appears in this biography Rhys always maintains an obscure dominion, if not over herself, then over other people. Her intransigence, capriciousness and abiding selfishness may not be pretty, but it’s these qualities that kept her going against all the odds.

5/16/2022,"I am 80 years old and recently lost my wife of 54 years. I wanted to replace our bed and in March I ordered a small 4ft double from HSL in Bristol. The salesperson was helpful and assured me the bed would fit up the stairwell of my 1932 semi-detached house. However, when it arrived the delivery men said there was no way they could get the frame and mattress up the stairs, so they had to take it away. This left me feeling distressed and confused. After discussion with my family I cancelled the order but discovered that under the terms of the contract I would be fined 30% of the £2,485 cost, which is £745.50. My family think this is excessive and it should be reduced to cover the company’s costs as the bed and mattress are brand new and can be resold.DT, Bristol You acknowledge that HSL’s cancellation policy was outlined in the sales contract you signed and the company also sets it out clearly on its website. However, you feel you were given bad advice in the store and the penalty you face should be reduced to reflect that. When we contacted HSL on your behalf, the company said: “Our terms and conditions clearly state that it is the customer’s responsibility to ensure that the appropriate access is available to ensure successful delivery.” However, it added that while unable to confirm that the salesperson had provided you with the reassurance you claim, customer satisfaction was its “number one priority”. It has agreed to reduce the cancellation charge to 10% (£248.50) and has reimbursed you £497.

5/16/2022,"The latest wireless earbuds from Sennheiser are smaller, longer lasting and have better sound and noise cancelling than their predecessors, making them some of the best on the market. Priced at £219.99 ($249.95/A$399.5), the third-generation Momentum true wireless earbuds look set to dethrone Sony’s WF-1000XM4 as the best-sounding earbuds you can buy. Succeeding the excellent 2020 model and adopting a similar design to the firm’s cheaper CX series of earbuds, they are 16% smaller and so fit better in my ears, making them more comfortable to wear for longer periods. And their squarer, smoother form is far less distinctive than their predecessor’s Rolo-like form. They feel light, really well made, and have IPX4 sweat resistance, which means they should be fine in the rain or workouts. Just don’t submerge them in liquid. The Sennheiser logo on the earbuds is a touchpad for a full set of customisable controls including volume and noise-cancelling modes, which work very well. Few competitors have as many options here. The battery lasts for about 6.5 hours of music with noise cancelling turned on, which is a hour or so short of Sony’s best but still very good. The case can fully charge the earbuds three times, and is topped up via USB-C or Qi wireless charging. It takes 90 minutes to fully charge the earbuds, but a 10-minute charge in the case is enough to add one hour of playback. Water resistance: IPX4 (splash) Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.2, SBC, AAC, aptX adaptive Battery life: 7 hours, up to 28 hours with case Earbud weight: 6g each Driver size: 7mm Charging case weight: 66g Case charging: USB-C, Qi wireless charging The best bit about the earbuds is how good they sound, producing rich, detailed audio with excellent separation of instruments. They are reasonably bassy, but low notes are punchy and well controlled. There is a bass boost function too, but I don’t think many will need it. Mid tones and high notes are detailed and well balanced, vocals are clear, and most music genres sound great. They lack a bit of energy in some electronica tracks but do a better job with jazz and classical than most competitors. There is a full equaliser and an option to create a custom setting through a short listening test. Sennheiser has promised to add a full sound personalisation setting that will go beyond simple equaliser adjustments in a future update. The earbuds have very effective active noise cancelling , which is capable of reducing most rumbles, fan noise and road noise by adjusting the level of noise suppression automatically to the environment. Its wind noise reduction setting is the best I have tried and the ambient awareness mode is good too. But they struggle a bit with speech and higher tones, such as the taps of fingers on a keyboard, and can’t quite match the performance of Sony’s class-leading WF-1000XM4. The earbuds support standard Bluetooth 5.2 with the universal SBC and AAC audio formats. But they also support the very latest aptX Adaptive audio format, which when used with a compatible device offers better audio quality and lower latency, which is particularly good for gaming. Only a handful of newer Android smartphones support aptX Adaptive at the moment, however. The earbuds can be used independently of each other, which is handy for calls. My voice sounded a bit robotic on the phone but was clear even when speaking in loud environments, effectively suppressing background noise. The Bluetooth connection to a range of phones, tablets and computers was rock solid, but they only connect to one device at a time at the moment. An update to support connection to two devices simultaneously (multi-point), such as a laptop and a phone, is promised at a later date. Sennheiser estimates the batteries in the earbuds and case will maintain at least 80% of their original capacity after four years of daily use, listening for two hours a day, but the batteries are not replaceable, ultimately making them disposable. Spare parts including tips, earbuds and cases are available. The earbuds do not contain any recycled material and Sennheiser does not publish impact assessments or operate trade-in schemes in the UK. The Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 come in a choice of three colours costing £219.99 ($249.95/A$399.5). For comparison, the Sony WF-1000XM4 cost £229, Beats Fit Pro cost £199, Apple AirPods Pro cost £249, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro cost £219, Jabra Elite 7 Pro cost £199, the Bose QC Earbuds cost £249.95 and the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 cost £99. The third-generation of Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless earbuds are an upgrade in almost all areas. They are some of the best-sounding Bluetooth earbuds you can get, have good noise cancelling, great controls, good battery life and support for the latest aptX Adaptive audio format. Despite still being at the premium end of the market costing £220, they are more competitive thanks to a price cut over their predecessors, too. The case is a little bigger than some, their design a little less interesting than before and they are waiting on an update for multi-point connection, but the worst thing about them is you can’t replace the battery so they are ultimately disposable, losing a star. Pros: top sound, effective noise cancelling, good ambient sound mode, long battery life, very comfortable, optional wings for keeping them in place, aptX Adaptive support, full equaliser, pocketable case, cross-platform app. Cons: expensive, waiting on updates for multi-point and sound customisation, case bigger than some of the best, calls can sound a bit robotic.

5/16/2022,"It sounds obvious but it is worth asking yourself why you want to sell your house and whether you will achieve what you want from the sale. Simon Shinerock, the chair of Choices Estate Agency, says it is worth checking out the area you want to move to and speaking to a mortgage broker to make sure you can get the finance for your next purchase. “Think about your linked purchase – will it dovetail [with your move]? Are you willing to move into rented accommodation if it doesn’t?” Shinerock says. These are all things that could determine how you feel about an offer from a buyer later. As soon as you have decided to sell, you should work on making sure your home looks as presentable as possible – even before you invite an estate agent in. “We’re all people, and if I’m going round and looking at a place and working out how easy it will be to sell and how much it will go for, then my perception of your property will affect that,” Shinerock says. “I wouldn’t invite anyone round to my house without first attending to it.” He says “people will buy what they see” – would-be buyers want to be shown a property they can mentally move into straight away. A tidy appearance to the front of your home doesn’t just include tidying up the garden or weeding the pathway, says Sanel Konyar, an interior designer who runs Interior Kollection. “It also applies to your front door and any accessories you add surrounding this first point of contact with potential buyers.” Repainting a tired-looking front door is a good start, as is mending a broken gate – anything that looks in need of fixing could be noted by a potential buyer as a hassle or expense they could do without. “If your outdoor mat looks like it has seen better days, remove and replace. This is an easy and cheap way to improve a buyer’s first glance yet is so often overlooked,” Konyar says. “If your front door features glass panels or a porch with glass before your front door, ensure that the hallway is clutter-free and boots and shoes are tidied away.” Talk to local estate agents and see if they will give you a quote for what the property is worth and their commission. A good place to start when picking an agent is recommendations from friends who have moved recently. See which companies have lots of boards (saying sold as well as for sale). You can use property websites such as Zoopla and Rightmove to get an insight into which agents are successfully selling homes near you – tick sold in your search to see these. Make contact and arrange to get an appraisal of your home. Once you have spoken to several estate agents you need to choose which one to go with. Compare their commission, sales success, valuation and where they advertise. You might choose the one you liked best – having a good rapport is important – or your decision might be based on the price or their recent success rate. If you like one agent but have been offered a better commission or shorter contract by another firm, don’t be afraid to ask your favoured person if they can match it. Agents are often willing to negotiate – especially when there are more buyers around than there are homes on the market. When you get an offer, your buyer’s solicitor will ask for all kinds of paperwork – you can prevent any hold-ups later by making sure you can put your hands on it now. Alex Lyle of the estate agency Antony Roberts says there’s a long list of things you should try to get ready, including proof of ID, as well as documents linked to any work you have had done on your property. Building regulations approval, planning permissions, Fensa certificates for replacement windows and doors, and a safety certificate for any new boiler are among the paperwork you will need to show – so pull them together now. Doing so gives you the chance to check there are no outstanding issues that need sorting out. Lyle says: “Too often, properties go under offer and then there’s an unnecessary delay in anything further happening. Usually, this is due to the vendor having not instructed a solicitor, or the solicitor has been instructed but doesn’t have the necessary information to provide to the buyer’s solicitor.” Clare Andrews, a residential property partner at the law firm Moore Barlow, says there are practical advantages to acting early. “In a competitive market, appointing a solicitor as soon as you can, not only sends a clear message out to potential buyers that you’re ready to proceed without delay, but gives your solicitor time to review the title deeds and iron out anything that could cause a problem in the transaction.” There is no harm in researching and choosing a solicitor to do your conveyancing before your property is on the market. Again, recommendations from friends are the best start. Otherwise, you can use the Law Society website to find a property specialist and check out reviews for the ones nearby. You will probably have an idea of what you want to raise from the sale – maybe based on what you have seen other properties go for in your neighbourhood. Shinerock says this may be useful “if you live on a road where there are lots of generic properties changing hands regularly” but if your home is at all different from those of your neighbours, you could be misled. Think about what the agents have suggested but bear in mind that some work on high turnover, so will underprice to sell fast – but that won’t get you top dollar. Starting too high is a danger as being forced to reduce the price on your property can give potential buyers the impression that something is wrong with your home. Lyle says you should not get carried away when deciding what to ask for: “It’s better to come on to the market slightly lower, attract more interest, and let people bid each other up to your desired price feeling like they’ve really won it.” Keep inside as clutter-free as you can for the agent’s photos and viewings. Samantha Agbontaen, the founder of Housedesigner.net, says sellers should avoid having too much furniture “and drastically reducing free space available for walking”. Your house will feel bigger if people can move around without having to squeeze past your belongings, so it could be worth putting some things in storage. If you have a loft or watertight shed you can stash things there. If not, it may be worth paying for storage for a few weeks to maximise the price you get for your home. “If your home is too minimalist, this can make it feel clinical and uninviting to potential buyers,” Konyar says.

5/16/2022,"Administrators for the collapsed rent-to-own firm BrightHouse, which specialised in loans for big-ticket items such as fridges and sofas, have warned they will not have enough money to compensate thousands of customers who were left with unaffordable debts. The latest report from the accountants Grant Thornton, which is managing the administration, shows a plan to set aside £600,000 for payouts to customers who may have been mis-sold expensive loans by BrightHouse has been scrapped. Meanwhile, a number of creditors have received large sums. They include the supply chain finance firm Greensill, which is itself in administration after collapsing last year. Greensill – or its creditors – have received nearly £31m. The process will raise fresh questions about how UK insolvency rules prioritise payouts for investors and lenders over customers. Before it went bust in 2020, BrightHouse offered high-interest rent-to-own contracts to customers who would otherwise struggle to afford the upfront costs of household goods such as fridges, ovens, TVs and sofas. It charged interest of up to 69.9%, which, on top of service and insurance fees, could mean customers were paying two to three times the cost of the item on the high street. Some customers were never able to own the goods if they fell behind on payments. BrightHouse customers were typically from low-income households receiving state benefits. The decision means some of the UK’s most vulnerable consumers could be missing out on crucial funds, just as the cost of living crisis squeezes finances. Grant Thornton originally set aside up to £600,000 to deal with more than 11,000 affordability claims from customers who fear they may have been mis-sold loans. But its latest report, published in late April, reveals that the administrators plan to seek court permission to scrap the compensation pot after deciding that the cost would be too high. “Given the likely significant volume and complexity of customers’ affordability claims … it is the administrators’ expectation that the cost associated with assessing these claims would far exceed the funds available for distribution,” the report said. “As a result of the above, the administrators are seeking to make an application to the court in the coming period to seek to disapply the prescribed part,” it added. Under the original plans, customers would have been due refunds for fees and interest, as well as an additional 8% interest on that sum dating back to the start of their loan. Meanwhile, administrators confirmed they had hired a debt collection agency to “improve” repayments from customers and “maximise” payouts for creditors. Those creditors have included Greensill Capital, whose collapse last year sparked a wave of political scandals. Greensill, which specialised in offering advances on company invoices for a fee, issued loans to BrightHouse in 2018. As a lender, Greensill was counted as a secured creditor, putting it at the front of the queue for repayment when its customer, BrightHouse, went bust. The administrators’ report confirmed that Greensill was repaid in full, receiving a total of £30.86m in 2020 – a year before it collapsed into administration. Sara Williams, a debt adviser and author of the Debt Camel blog, said: “The hundreds of thousands of customers who should have had a refund for unaffordable lending will receive nothing. The money that customers have been pushed into paying during the administration is all going to the secured creditors.” She added: “The government and the Insolvency Service need to change this. The customers are the innocent victims here and they should be given priority. Administrators should not seek to collect debts without considering first if the loan was mis-sold.” The issue is particularly acute for customers of rent-to-own firms, who are typically young, female, or single parents, living in rented accommodation. Customers have faced similar problems when dealing with the collapsed payday lenders such as Wonga. Hundreds of thousands of its former borrowers who were mis-sold loans by the company were told they would only receive 4.3p for every £1 owed in compensation. A spokesperson for administrators at Grant Thornton, which is also handling Greensill’s wind-down in the UK, said they were carrying out their obligations in line with UK insolvency rules and have distributed assets from BrightHouse “as required by legislation”. The spokesperson said.“Whilst Greensill Capital (UK) Ltd was previously a secured creditor to BrightHouse, any obligations it was owed as part of BrightHouse’s administration were paid to it in accordance with the law and prior to it entering into administration itself. We have no further comments beyond the contents of the administrators’ filings in respect of both matters.” A spokesperson for the Insolvency Service said: “The insolvency framework is designed to ensure that the creditors of an insolvent business receive as much of their money back as possible, and it is the duty of insolvency practitioners to consider the interests of all of the creditors in carrying out their work.”",Lifestyle/Money,"BrightHouse loan customers unlikely to get refunds, say administrators",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/may/16/brighthouse-loan-customers-efunds-administrators-greensill

5/16/2022,"Anthony Albanese has accused the government of “playing politics” with national security after revelations it kept Labor in the dark about the Aukus agreement despite Washington’s desire for bipartisan support. The West Australian premier, Mark McGowan, has also criticised the Coalition for its rhetoric about a Chinese spy ship off the coast of WA last week, alleging that the defence minister, Peter Dutton, was “the biggest threat to national security”. The comments intensify the political dispute over national security with less than a week to polling day. The Nine newspapers reported on the weekend that Labor was only briefed about the Aukus security partnership the day before it was made public last September, despite the US making clear in negotiations that it wanted enduring bipartisan backing for the deal given it would be a decades-long endeavour. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, reportedly assured the Americans that Labor would be supportive of the deal based on his assessment of the political dynamics, but Labor has cried foul, saying it should have been brought into the tent earlier. “Even though Labor could not have been more clear, more decisive, or more certain about our support for Aukus, this prime minister has continued to play politics,” Albanese said.“The US administration, the information is out there, that they expected Labor to be briefed because this is an issue that doesn’t go for a year or a term of parliament,” Albanese said. He rejected suggestions that the top-secret nature of the agreement, which gives Australia access to US nuclear-powered submarine technology for the first time, precluded bipartisan discussions, saying Labor had “national security briefings all the time.” “What this prime minister always does is put the political interests first before the national interest. It’s always about the politics,” Albanese said. But Morrison on Monday defended the Coalition’s handling of negotiations, saying he wasn’t going to risk sharing the details with Labor until the deal was finalised. He noted that ultimately the agreement had secured bipartisan support. “This was a process that, for 18 months, painstakingly working through incredible detail, incredibly sensitive issues, highly confidential. This wasn’t something I was going to be loose with,” he said. “Aukus is a groundbreaking agreement, the most significant defence security agreement Australia has entered into in over 70 years. And I was not going to risk that on the Labor party.” He also rejected suggestions that Australia had defied the US in not including Labor in earlier discussions, saying the government had “absolutely complied with all of the issues that needed to be addressed in forming that partnership”. “We understood absolutely what the requirements were and we met them 100 per cent,” he said. “I find it passing strange that you think we wouldn’t have maintained the absolute discretion, as we did with so many of our own cabinet.”“I mean, we’ve only seen it highlighted over the course of the last couple of weeks – you’ve got the deputy leader of the Labor party [Richard Marles], who would have been sitting in such a briefing, who had, you know, frequent flyer points for visiting the Chinese embassy in Australia.” The Australian newspaper has reported that Marles has held 10 meetings with the Chinese embassy or officials in the past five years. However, the same article noted Marles had held “29 meetings with US embassy officials over the time he had 10 with Chinese officials”. Marles rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing, accusing the government of embarking on a “pretty desperate” attempt to distract from its own failures. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning McGowan on Monday claimed Dutton and Morrison were whipping up fear for votes at the election, blasting them for “inflammatory” language around the way a Chinese spy ship’s presence was announced on Friday. “All this rhetoric by Mr Dutton is just politics. His language around war and around ‘we’ve got to be prepared to fight’, all this sort of stuff that’s gone on for the last year is highly dangerous, and it’s against the national interest,” the Labor premier said. “It’s inflammatory, and unnecessary. And I just think he’s, you know, he’s the biggest threat to national security.” Asked about the Chinese surveillance vessel, which had been travelling through parts of Australia’s exclusive economic zone for a week before Dutton announced its presence and called it “an aggressive act”, McGowan didn’t hold back. “They’ve known about this for a week or so they’ve got the information out there. Mr Dutton is just trying to stir up fear and all that sort of things to win votes. That’s what’s going on,” McGowan said. McGowan said he didn’t know about the ship’s presence until after Dutton’s press conference. He noted he had been a navy legal officer before entering politics, and that ships transiting through other nations’ EEZ was not uncommon. “United States, Australia, Britain, we send ships up into other countries exclusive economic zones. If we’re going to allege it’s an aggressive act, other countries can allege that about us,” McGowan said. “I just think we need to be very careful about language on these things, because otherwise, you’re essentially giving other countries the opportunity to say the same thing about us when we send ships through other countries exclusive economic zones, including China.” In a press conference in Perth on Friday, Dutton said Australians “deserve to know what is taking place” and said the public understood “the reality of the Indo-Pacific at the moment, the acts of aggression from the Chinese leadership and from the Chinese government”. Dutton said the ship was “hugging the coastline as it goes north and its intention will be to collect as much electronic intelligence as it can”. He said the ship had been “in close proximity to military and intelligence installations on the west coast of Australia.”",News/Australia news,Labor accuses Coalition of ‘playing politics’ with national security after reports of Aukus snub,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/labor-accuses-coalition-of-playing-politics-with-national-security-after-reports-of-aukus-snub
5/16/2022,"So housing affordability has taken centre stage in the campaign. And would you believe it, the policy is designed around pumping up demand rather than addressing supply. As economist Saul Eslake has noted, pretty much every major housing affordability policy going back to the 1960s has been about pumping up demand. This has especially been the case since 2000 and the John Howard years, when he was infamously quoted in 2003 saying “I don’t get people stopping me in the street and saying, ‘John you’re outrageous, under your government the value of my house has increased’.” And has pumping up demand worked to improve housing affordability? Well, no: If the graph does not display click here So what can we do that won’t drive up housing prices? Look, I know this is not going to happen, but that does not mean it should still not be pursued. A major issue with the housing market is that owner-occupiers are at a disadvantage to investors because the taxation system is skewed towards investors through two things – negative gearing and the capital gains 50% discount. Negative gearing was really just a few embers in the housing market – what caused it to turn into a bonfire was when John Howard poured petrol on it by changing how capital gains were discounted. The introduction of the 50% discount not only caused a massive surge in the level of capital gains but also the amount of rental income that was now a loss: If the graph does not display click here If negative gearing is too tough to touch, then the treatment of capital gains needs to be reformed to remove the double incentive of being able to buy a property, claim a loss and then sell it and get a tax benefit from the capital gain. But OK, we know that won’t happen in this environment, so what about … gee, I don’t know, do something about supply? The Grattan Institute has been looking at housing for some time and in one of its most recent reports noted that “unlike most developed countries, Australia has had little increase in housing per person in the past two decades”. The obvious solution is to increase supply and one way is through actually making this easier to occur. Australia’s planning rules are highly restrictive and very much favour “nimbyism” that only serves to protect those who own a house over those who would wish to become owners. A federal government could also provide incentives to local governments to open up areas for medium density housing – ie increasing the supply. Stamp duty, in the words of the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Philip Lowe, is “a tax on mobility – on people moving location”. He added that “if we’re looking for an economy that’s dynamic and vibrant, we want to remove taxes on mobility”. The government’s current plan involves giving tax incentives to those aged over 55 if they sell their home. But being able to put “$300,000 into superannuation from the sale of their home” only further distorts the already horrendous distortions in the superannuation system which will again favour those who already own houses – and who would now have an advantage over those first-home buyers competing for the same two or three bedroom homes. It is ineffective as a tax incentive to overcome the tax problem of stamp duty. So why not remove stamp duty instead of further distorting the superannuation and housing system? But these are all about the private sector side of things. Let’s be honest, over 40 years of evidence has shown the private sector will not provide a solution. So: My colleagues at the Australia Institute’s Nordic Policy Centre have noted that a major issue with Australia housing policy is that it regards housing as an asset rather than a need. Prof Andrew Scott notes that “from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s the commonwealth shifted most of its funding to assist payment of rent including for tenants in the private sector – rather than giving more support to the states to supply public housing”. This meant by the mid-1990s “public housing became seen increasingly as ‘residual welfare’ housing”. The move away from public and social housing to incentivising private housing is clear when you consider that in the past year around 10% less public housing was built than in 1970, despite our population now being double what it was then: If the graph does not display click here Prof Street notes that this is a purposeful state of affairs, not a natural one. He notes that “in Sweden, public housing is more than triple the proportion it is in Australia”. One solution he proposes also involves the superannuation sector. But rather than, in effect, trying to individualise the gains that occur from the community pool of superannuation, he recommends instead “the Australian government should now require some of the collective capital in superannuation funds to be invested in affordable housing to ensure fund members can have an adequate retirement”. Another Nordic policy that could be pursued involves co-operatives. As Prof Scott puts it “rental housing co-operatives exist to provide housing, not accrue wealth”. In a co-operative the building or property is owned by a legal entity of which the residents are members and joint owners. Sweden’s housing co-operatives amount to 22% of the total housing stock, while it is 15% in all of Norway, but 40% in the capital, Oslo. As his colleague Dr Sidsel Grimstad notes, it is “similar in many ways to strata title in Australia, where a body corporate of the residents manages the shared spaces jointly. But the main difference is that a housing co-operative is ‘user-owned’ while strata title is ‘investor-owned’.” A key aspect of co-operative housing is that you must live in the dwelling, not use it as an investment. And for rental co-operatives, tenants do not own their dwelling but instead, as Grimstad notes “rent it affordably from a non-profit housing organisation” and they are “actively involved in decision-making and management of maintenance and outdoor areas”. Will these be what everyone wants? Obviously not. But it highlights that there are numerous different paths ahead that don’t involve pumping up demand and pumping up prices.

5/16/2022,"Good morning. Boris Johnson travels to Northern Ireland today to confront a political paradox: the Democratic Unionist party lost support at the recent Stormont elections, and is using the moment to exert its power. On Friday, the DUP blocked the election of a speaker at the Northern Ireland assembly, leaving the power-sharing assembly unable to function in an attempt to secure changes to the post-Brexit protocol which governs trade across the Irish Sea. After a weekend of not-that-diplomatic media appearances by Conservatives which seemed to reinforce the prospect of the UK unilaterally overriding parts of the deal without EU agreement, Johnson is expected to strike a more conciliatory tone in Belfast. He will say he’s seeking reform that has “the broadest possible cross-community support”. But with ministers expected to meet as soon as tomorrow to sign off plans that would allow the UK to unilaterally rewrite parts of the same agreement Johnson hailed as a “very good deal” when he signed it, not everybody believes him. In a potentially crucial week for Northern Ireland’s future, today’s newsletter will try to set the scene by explaining who wants what. First, here are the headlines. Police | Priti Patel has been accused of a “power grab” which would allow her to intervene in local law enforcement matters and silence police chiefs. One chief constable called the plans “profoundly dangerous”. US gun violence | Joe Biden said racially motivated hate crime was “abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation” after an 18-year-old white supremacist killed 10 people in Buffalo, New York. The attacker shot 11 Black and two white victims. Ukraine | Russia may have lost a third of the invasion force it sent into Ukraine, British military intelligence said. The estimate came as Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said Russia’s offensive in Donbas had stalled and Ukraine could win the war. Wagatha Christie | Wayne Rooney will this week give evidence in his wife’s libel trial with Rebekah Vardy. The multimillion-pound case is entering its final days at the high court in London. Protest | A new statue of Margaret Thatcher was egged within two hours of it being installed in her home town of Grantham on Sunday. There had been warnings that protests were ““absolutely inevitable”. Ah, Brexit! Did you miss it? If you have trouble keeping the complexities of the Northern Ireland protocol straight in your head, you’re not alone. (The sharp spike in searches over the last week tells its own story, and they can’t *all* be journalists writing on deadline.) You can remind yourself of what’s at stake with Lisa O’Carroll’s very clear explainer from last week, or Friday’s First Edition from Nimo Omer - but here’s a very quick refresher: by putting checks on goods coming across the Irish Sea from Great Britain, the protocol was supposed to be a pragmatic guarantee of Northern Ireland’s smooth future trading relationship with the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. But the DUP and their allies say that, no matter that the British government signed them off, the checks are inhibiting trade with the rest of the UK. Whether by accident or design, one of the most striking parts of the recent resumption in diplomatic hostilities over the protocol has been the difficulty of figuring out what the British government really wants – and that has only intensified alarm on the other side. So here’s a guide to what we know about where the key players stand. Boris Johnson The details released in advance of the prime minister’s visit to Belfast today emphasise his desire for power-sharing to resume – and to seek “the broadest cross-community support” for reforms to the protocol. That might be read as an attempt to cool tensions with the EU by urging the DUP to get back to Stormont. Jessica Elgot and Lisa O’Carroll’s story quotes a Whitehall source saying: “The priority tomorrow is to calm things down.” If so, reports that ministers will work to sign off on the wording of a law that would allow changes to the protocol without the EU’s consent this week might be read as a negotiating tactic. “We want a weapon on the table,” an unnamed senior ally of the prime minister is quoted as saying in the Sunday Times. “We don’t want to use it.” Less obviously peaceful is the wording in Johnson’s very long article for the Belfast Telegraph today: “I hope the EU’s position changes. If it does not, there will be a necessity to act”. Liz Truss Boris Johnson is not the only government player – and much of the briefing in recent days has centred on claims that the foreign secretary has a far more combative approach. Her conversation with her EU counterpart Maroš Šefčovič on Thursday, in which she said that unless the EU showed more flexibility the UK would have “no choice but to act”, was said to have “flabbergasted” Brussels. With claims (categorically denied) that her allies are undermining more cautious cabinet colleagues and trying to throw red meat to the Tory membership in case of any vacancy at No 10, one Downing Street source called her approach “leadership feather-fluttering”. (Sidenote: has anyone used a phrase like “leadership feather-fluttering” who doesn’t work in politics?) She is not alone: Downing Street deputy chief of staff David Canzini has been said to take the same line, while former Brexit negotiator Lord Frost last week said Johnson must take the same approach in Northern Ireland that he has in Ukraine and rip up the protocol. If that seems like a transparently provocative bit of rhetoric, it’s also a very deliberate one. Tory MPs We might be used to the avid Brexiteers of the European Research Group setting the backbench agenda – but more moderate Conservative voices appear to be more of a problem for the government on this. Last week, some of those backbenchers suggested that an intervention from Theresa May was only the beginning of strong opposition to any attempt to override the protocol. On Sunday, the Conservative chair of the Northern Ireland select committee Simon Hoare said it would be “naive nonsense for the government to ask anyone to believe that they didn’t understand what they signed up to”. A quick study of Boris Johnson’s previous praise of the protocol would suggest he has a point. Still, if other MPs are convinced that those moves really are a negotiating tactic, many of them may stay quiet for now. The DUP If voters in Northern Ireland were rejecting the DUP’s intransigence at the recent Stormont election, that message does not appear to have been heard: instead of presenting a more moderate face to win voters from the surging centrist Alliance party and the Ulster Unionist party, the DUP has doubled down. That is partly a matter of principle – and partly, Rory Carroll wrote on Friday, an attempt to reassure those who defected to the party’s more radical new rival, the Traditional Unionist Voice. (The UUP also opposes the protocol but opposes disruption to the running of Stormont.) Ahead of Johnson’s visit, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson – who has previously claimed that his party did “extremely well” in an election where their vote fell by almost a quarter – said that he did not expect to be swayed. “We await to hear what the prime minister has to say, but we will not make judgments based on words,” he said. “It is decisive action that must be taken.” Sinn Féin Unsurprisingly, Sinn Féin’s deputy leader and would-be first minister Michelle O’Neill takes a very different view: she has said she will tell Johnson “that he needs to stop pandering to the DUP” and said that overriding the protocol would be “reckless” and “deepen political instability”. She presents that as a moderate view as well as an ideological one: crucial to her approach has been presenting herself as ready to “take on the leadership of the Northern Ireland executive as a first minister for all” – the first time she has ever used the phrase “Northern Ireland”. That is an extension of what Rory Carroll described last week as a “tightly disciplined campaign that targeted centrist voters and focused on the cost of living and healthcare as opposed to a united Ireland”. Ireland and the EU Perhaps the sharpest signs of the difficulties that could lie ahead came in Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney’s interview with Sky News’ Sophy Ridge yesterday. He said he was “deeply concerned for the wellbeing of the partnership between our countries.” And he added that while he would prefer to be “good neighbours, good friends” – Ramsay Street diplomacy, you might call it – hostile briefings from the UK government had “raised a real red flag in Dublin and in Brussels” and “forced Ireland into taking a much more strident position”. For all that, Coveney did hold out hope for a compromise, acknowledging that unionists have “legitimate concerns” over the protocol. He said that it was reasonable to look for a way to limit checks on goods which are going to stay in Northern Ireland, and that the EU did not want a trade war – but that if a “landing zone” could not be found, there would be consequences. Boris Johnson’s visit to Belfast is unlikely to provide a conclusive answer as to whether the British government is really up for that kind of clash – but that uncertainty can’t last much longer. It’s been almost nine months since Afghanistan fell to the Taliban. In this brilliant, detailed piece Ruchi Kumar and Hikmat Noori examine how the new laws are forcing women out of the workforce and what it means for the future of the country.

Nimo There’s absolutely nothing wrong with punctuating your sentences with ‘like’. Sam Wolfson’s Observer piece is a juicy explanation of why, featuring fascinating linguists (Is there any other kind?) on one side, and Michael Gove on the other. Archie If you missed it on Saturday, Simon Hattenstone’s interview with Jacob Dunne, who killed a stranger with a single punch and then turned his life around, is complicated, surprising, and totally riveting.

A bit of good news to remind you that the world’s not all bad After many years of dismal failure, the UK finally had a decent night at Eurovision - only giving up first place to a winner everybody could get behind, Ukraine. Of the UK entry from Sam Ryder (picturing arriving at Heathrow above), TV critic and Eurovision pundit Scott Bryan said: “The song was fantastic but just as importantly the performance was fantastic … it was a real thrill to watch.” Meanwhile, Kalush Orchestra’s victory for Ukraine with their anthemic folk/hip-hop song Stefania led to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy promising that the contest would “one day” be held in Mariupol.

5/16/2022,"One morning last summer, Nasira* arrived for work at the government building in Kabul where she was employed in a managerial position to find men from the Taliban had occupied her office. “I wasn’t allowed to enter,” the 32-year-old says. “When I enquired why, I was told to wait for a government announcement, which never came.” This was shortly after the Taliban swept to power and seized Kabul, the capital city, on 15 August 2021. That was the last day that Nasira and thousands of women like her were able to go to work. Though the Taliban’s acting prime minister, Mullah Mohammad Hassan Akhund, claimed that women would be allowed to continue working under sharia law, female government employees in Kabul were told to stay at home, and only women whose jobs cannot be done by men were allowed to work. Nasira is technically still employed and receives a significantly reduced salary. “They tell me, ‘we are paying you, what else do you need?’ But money is not my priority,” she says. “I was responsible for our department’s services to women citizens. I want to serve my people, especially the women of my country, who are not receiving services they need because there are no women officials to help them.” It is not only government positions that women have been forced out of. According to Reporters Without Borders, only 100 of Kabul’s 700 female journalists were still working by the end of 2021. In 2019, 36% of teachers in the country were women, according World Bank data, the highest number for 20 years, but the Taliban’s ban in March on education for girls forced many female educators out of work. Sima Bahous, the UN Women executive director, said this month: “Current restrictions on women’s employment have been estimated to result in an immediate economic loss of up to $1bn – or up to 5% of Afghanistan’s GDP.” She added: “There is almost universal poverty in the country.” The Afghan academic and former minister of mines, Nargis Nehan, says: “It is hard to collect data under the Taliban, and access to information is limited, but under the previous government 27% of the civil servants and almost 40% of the teachers were women. But only a handful of women are allowed to work these days.” The latest in the series of decrees issued by the recently reinstated ministry for the propagation of virtue requires “all respectable Afghan women to wear a hijab” – and identifying the chador (the blue Afghan burqa) as the “best hijab” of choice – will have a significant impact on the remaining women in public roles. The order also went on to criminalise women’s clothes and said female government employees who violated the dress code would be fired. “As per the Afghan Women’s Chamber of Commerce, we had over 3,500 small and medium business owners who were women, the majority of whom are now closed because they couldn’t survive,” Nehan says. “Because how do you expect women to work or run a business under a chador or facing fear of punishment for showing their face?” A gynaecologist from Herat, who wishes to be identified only as Dr Maryam, says: “Even before this decree, they made hijab mandatory for women doctors, and require female surgeons to wear long sleeves, and a long scarf, even during surgery. It affects the way they work and is not safe.” Armed Taliban officials often force themselves into the hospital, she adds, especially during night shifts, to “monitor the work” of the female doctors and nurses. “They had also briefly insisted on women doctors having their mahram [male guardian] with them at all times, which is not practical especially on a women’s ward.” There are no figures for the number of women who have left healthcare roles, but according to an article from the BMJ, women make up nearly half of Afghanistan’s community health worker programme. “One hospital in Kabul reported that segregation of men and women, for staff as well as patients, had been requested already,” the BMJ said. “Women are especially restricted in their freedom of movement and often require male guardians to merely leave their homes. Even midwives have to be accompanied when doing home visits. Due to lack of information, some are stuck at home entirely, waiting for new directions.” “Although these restrictions are not new – I recall working under the Taliban regime the last time they were in power and had imposed similar restrictions – they are new to this generation, and will discourage younger women from joining professions under the Taliban’s hateful gaze,” Maryam says. “Do we really want to go back to those days? How will it benefit Afghanistan?” The Taliban takeover prompted many Afghan female doctors, especially those who worked in reproductive and sexual health, to flee the country. Those who remained are now facing threats from local Taliban leaders for not complying with their rules, Maryam says. Afghan women have made significant inroads into various sectors over the past 20 years, after the fall of the Taliban in 2001. According to World Bank data, women comprised nearly 22% of the Afghan workforce and numbers were steadily growing. But a report from the International Labour Organization (ILO) in January found that Afghan women’s employment levels fell by an estimated 16% in the third quarter of 2021, compared with 6% for men. Women’s employment was expected to be 21% lower than before the Taliban takeover by mid-2022 if current conditions continued, according to the ILO, though this does not take into account employees such as Nasira who are still paid without being allowed to work. Restricting women from participating in economic and public activities will have a dire impact on the economy, a UN report warned last December. It could, for example, shave half a billion dollars from household consumption alone. Nasira’s supervisor, who wished be identified only as Abdul, confirms that services have been affected since female colleagues were sent home. “I had seven women in my team and, since the Taliban takeover, none of them has been allowed back to work. They were the backbone of the department, and to be honest, they were more hardworking than the men,” he says. “Not only has our workload increased, we are unable to provide adequate technical services to Afghan women, who were way more comfortable approaching our female staff with their problems. We are worse off without our female colleagues.” * Some names have been changed.

5/16/2022,"Sea sponges off New Zealand’s southern coastline have been found bleached bone-white for the first time, following extreme ocean temperatures. A group of scientists from Victoria University of Wellington were alarmed to discover the sponges, which are typically a rich chocolate brown, were bleached in more than a dozen sites near Breaksea Sound and Doubtful Sound in Fiordland. The university’s marine biology professor James Bell said in some parts as many as 95% of the sponges were bleached. “Our initial estimates are there are at least hundreds of thousands of sponges likely to have been bleached and maybe even many more than that,” he said. Bell’s team discovered the mass bleaching during a research trip in April. The species, which is common to the lower South Island, is one of 800 species of sponge found in New Zealand. Sponge gardens dominate the sea floor around the country and hold an important role in creating habitats for fish and releasing carbon that other species feed off. There have been reports of sponges bleaching, including off the coast of Tasmania earlier this year, but typically they tend to be more tolerant to oceanic changes compared with other species such as corals, Bell said. “It’s a really unusual event,” he said. “This just highlights the kind of climate crisis that we’re facing. There are so many species around New Zealand and we don’t know what their thermal tolerances are.” Last year, the world’s oceans were the hottest in recorded history, due to climate change, which among other things can cause the oceans to acidify and degrade reefs and ecosystems. New Zealand was no exception, with 2021 its hottest year on record. Temperatures in April were still unseasonably high, with coastal water temperatures up to 2.6 degrees above average, according to the National Institute for Water and Atmospherics. In Fiordland, those temperatures were even higher, said Rob Smith, a University of Otago oceanographer, who works with the government-funded Moana Project researching marine heatwaves. He told RNZ the region recorded temperatures up to 5 degrees higher than usual. “What we’ve seen this summer is the strongest marine heatwave on the west coast of the South Island in 40 years.” Further research was needed to establish definitively whether ocean temperatures are causing the bleaching, Bell said. At this stage the researchers had an observation and a “very strong correlation” between the bleaching and a severe temperature spike. Some bleached sponges could come back to life, Bell said, but the team would need to return to the site to see how they were faring towards the end of the month. “There is some hope they may not die, but unfortunately some of them are a little bit manky and not very happy or healthy.”",News/World news,Bleached sea sponges found in New Zealand waters for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/bleached-sea-sponges-found-in-new-zealand-waters-for-first-time

5/16/2022,"The Coalition’s twin-pronged housing policy is likely to push up property prices to the benefit of existing homeowners, with only modest effects on increasing supply, market analysts say. Scott Morrison announced the plan on Sunday at the Coalition’s formal campaign launch, with first homebuyers to be allowed to access as much as $50,000 of their superannuation to help muster a mortgage deposit. To boost supply, the policy would also encourage more “empty-nesters” aged over 55 to downsize. Critics have amplified an admission to ABC’s RN Breakfast by the superannuation minister, Jane Hume, on Monday that allowing people to use their retirement nest eggs was likely to trigger “a bump in house prices”. Eliza Owen, the head of Australian research at the property data firm CoreLogic, said the super component of the plan would “add to demand, and this could increase the cost of housing”. “This may be good news for homeowners looking to protect their wealth, or sellers in an environment where housing market conditions are starting to soften, but for first homebuyers it could erode some of the benefit of dipping into their super,” Owen said. With construction costs rising sharply, it was also “a very challenging time to be incentivising more housing demand in the face of supply-side constraints”, she said. Past policies to aid first-time entrants to the property market tend to have only short-term effects, CoreLogic data showed. There were also equity issues to consider. @corelogicau has some interesting analysis on the Coalition's housing policy. One point is to note how first-home buyers have responded to previous temporary support packages. #auspol #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/6qIymwkdPO In June 2020 the median superannuation balance was about $55,000, while for those between 25 and 34 years of age it was less than half that at $25,000, CoreLogic cited ABS data as saying. At a cap of 40%, the scheme would offer no more than $10,000 on a median level, or a similar amount of support as offered by some state grants.With a median property now fetching just under $750,000, the plan would help increase the size of a standard deposit only by about 1%, Owen said. “Unlike the first home loan deposit scheme, or Labor’s proposed shared equity scheme, there are no income caps associated with the Super Home Buyer Scheme, making it far more advantageous for young first homebuyers on higher incomes.” The independent economist Saul Eslake said the Coalition’s policy made him “want to scream”. “This reckless inflation of house prices must stop! But of course it won’t,” he said. Eslake said 60 years of “unambiguous and unequivocal evidence” showed that policies allowing Australians to pay more for housing than they otherwise could resulted in higher house prices rather than higher levels of home ownership. These included first homeowner grants, stamp duty concessions, mortgage deposit guarantee schemes, shared equity schemes, preferential tax treatment for property investors, lower interest rates and reductions in credit standards. “This scheme will be warmly welcomed by the 11 million or so voters who already own at least one residential property, and especially by the 2 million or so voters who own two or more properties,” he said, adding that a “much smaller number” of would-be first homebuyers with the capacity to take advantage of the plan would also support it. “But it will be greeted with despair, I suspect, by the majority of the typically 100,000 people a year who succeed in becoming first-time buyers, plus the – presumably larger – number who would like to but have been unable to become first-time buyers,” Eslake said. Sally Tindall, research director at RateCity, agreed the Coalition’s policy would “probably inflate prices”. “It’s like flicking a switch, where one point in time people suddenly have access to a large sum of money in order to go out there and buy their first home.” “So that could encourage a flood of buyers in the market who suddenly have an extra lot of money to spend,” Tindall said, adding that none of policies from the major parties addressed the root cause of the problem, “which is that property prices are too high”. The scheme had the benefit of requiring people to put the money back into super, plus any capital gains, assuming there are any. Still, the experience in New Zealand – with their non-compulsory retirement scheme – was that withdrawals got higher and higher as property prices rose, she said. Interesting chart on what's happened to New Zealanders' super accounts when they were permitted to use retirement accounts to get into housing. Once you get on this path, it seems to go just one way... #auspol #ausvotes #ausvotes2022 pic.twitter.com/mAkRZuOuxF The prime minister sought to counter criticism that adding demand to the property market would lift prices, saying it was “a balanced, responsible plan which we’ve thought through, which we think minimises any potential impact on house prices”. The balance included “freeing-up housing stock with our downsizing policy”, he said. The existing policy that allows people over 65 to sell up and tip as much as $600,000 of a property sale into their super accountswould be lowered to benefit those over 55 if the government were returned. In march THIS YEAR the Parliamentary Committee looking at housing affordability, Chaired by Liberal MP Jason Falinski found letting people withdraw super to buy a house would “likely increase demand and lead to higher property prices”…March. This year. Chaired by a Lib #auspol pic.twitter.com/jKe8kMA3js CoreLogic’s Owen said the current policy had registered just 22,000 sales between July 2018 and May 2021. Population data suggests the take-up was just 3.4% of eligible households. “Many older Australians may love the area where they live, but their area may not have adequate middle-to-high density housing for them to move in to,” Owen said. And “with kids living at home for longer, helping with grandchildren, some may actually find a larger family home still suits them well into their 50s and 60s”. Tindall, meanwhile, said the property market was anyway cooling off as interest rates rise, with “plenty more to come” from the Reserve Bank. “[There’s] somewhat of a correction across the property market in certain areas, which could give some first homebuyers breathing space,” she said. As auction clearance rates tumble, it's worth remembering that investors are betting the cash rate will every month the RBA meets until about February (though economists are not so 'bullish'). #auspol #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/JLVoJDvryU Cassandra Goldie, head of the Australian Council of Social Service, said the downsizing plan was also inequitable. “This policy adds to a succession of recent policy announcements that make it easier for wealthy older people to transfer their savings into superannuation to take advantage of generous tax concessions, including removal of the work test for people aged 65 to 74 years so they can keep making contributions to superannuation,” she said. “At a time when younger generations are struggling to break into the housing market, it is unfair and unacceptable for wealthy older people, who were fortunate enough to buy when prices were much lower, to be handed yet another opportunity to avoid tax by shifting more of their savings into super,” Goldie said.",News/Australia news,"Coalition super housing policy likely to inflate prices by increasing demand, analysts say",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/coalition-super-housing-policy-likely-to-inflate-prices-by-increasing-demand-analysts-say
5/16/2022,"The federal government has successfully blocked Bernard Collaery from obtaining key documents about the lawfulness of the notorious spy operation against Timor-Leste, arguing that questions about its legality are irrelevant. Collaery, a lawyer and one-time attorney general of the Australian Capital Territory, is awaiting trial on charges of conspiring to reveal classified information while working with his client, the former spy Witness K, in relation to a 2004 operation to bug the offices of Timor-Leste’s government during oil and gas negotiations. To aid his defence, Collaery attempted to subpoena documents from the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Office of National Intelligence, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which he hoped would show whether the mission was conducted unlawfully and outside of the proper functions of Asis. He argued he would be entitled to be acquitted if a jury had any reasonable doubt about the lawfulness of Asis’s activities, making the documents relevant to his case. But the commonwealth resisted the subpoenas, saying the material and questions about the legality of Asis’s mission – the existence of which it has steadfastly refused to confirm or deny – were irrelevant to the case. On Monday, Justice David Mossop agreed with the federal government and set aside Collaery’s subpoenas. He said the burden on the prosecution was only to prove that an offence had been committed by Collaery’s alleged disclosure of protected Asis information. That “does not extend to a requirement to prove compliance with every provision of the [Intelligence Services] Act relevant to the activity of Asis which gives rise to the information or matter disclosed”, Mossop said. Mossop cited the 1974 royal commission examining intelligence and security, which discussed Asis’s role and said that “in all cases, however, espionage is illegal and the clandestine service’s job is to break those laws without being caught”. He found the Intelligence Services Act could not be interpreted as allowing information about Asis and its activities to be revealed in cases where it had not complied entirely with its legal obligations. “Such an interpretation would render the provision ineffective and potentially compromise both Asis’s ability to obtain foreign intelligence and the safety of its personnel,” he said in a judgment summary. Collaery hoped the documents, among other things, would establish whether the then foreign affairs minister, Alexander Downer, had given notice of the operation to parliament’s joint committee on intelligence and security, as required. The lawyer sought to argue that failing to give such notice meant his prosecution for disclosing information about the same intelligence operation could not succeed. Mossop said that cannot have been the intention of parliament when creating the nation’s intelligence laws. “That would mean that, by reason of a procedural error on the part of the minister, the details of the operation, details of Asis operational methods and capacities, the identity of its agents and the identity of persons overseas who cooperated with Asis might all be disclosed without fear of prosecution,” he wrote. “The same consequences would flow if there was non-compliance with any of the other provisions identified by the defendant.” “Those consequences may well be fatal for persons connected with the operation and would certainly be fatal to the capacity of Asis to obtain foreign intelligence.” The Collaery case has been bogged down in protracted battles over the extraordinary level of secrecy shrouding parts of the prosecution’s case from the public and Collaery himself. Collaery won a major victory last year in the ACT court of appeal which overturned secrecy orders covering parts of his trial. But the commonwealth is making a second attempt – using evidence that Collaery is not allowed to see – to convince the courts that parts of the trial pose a national security risk and must not be heard publicly. The extent of secrecy in the case is such that the ACT court of appeal’s initial judgment, handed down in October, still has not been published, because the commonwealth fears it contains information that will prejudice national security. Lawyers for the attorney general, Michaelia Cash, have gone to the high court to try to stop the full judgment from being published. A Human Rights Law Centre senior lawyer, Kieran Pender, said the prosecution must cease. “Whoever wins the election this weekend must drop the prosecution of Bernard Collaery, and the two other whistleblowers currently on trial, Richard Boyle and David McBride,” he said. “Rather than dragging whistleblowers through the courts, in cases shrouded in secrecy, the new government should reform whistleblowing law to make it easier for Australians to safely and lawfully speak up about wrongdoing.”",News/Australia news,Government successfully blocks Bernard Collaery from obtaining documents on legality of spy mission,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/government-successfully-blocks-bernard-collaery-from-obtaining-documents-on-legality-of-spy-mission
5/16/2022,"Some images never leave you: one that plays itself out in my mind is that of a teenage girl discovered in bed one morning curled up, bloody, with her baby, who is dead. She had given birth without assistance. Another: a woman – who did not know she was pregnant at the time – who gave birth to a stillborn baby in a toilet, having cried and cried for medical help. In both of these cases, which occurred in the last two years, the victims were in prison at the time they went into labour, and their babies died. Does that change how you see these women? It doesn’t for me. Regardless of her crime, this failing shows that prison is no place for a pregnant woman. It simply isn’t safe. One in 10 give birth in prison rather than a hospital, or on the way to the hospital. Women in prison are five times more likely to have a stillbirth and twice as likely to give birth to a premature baby that needs special care; 28% of the babies born to women serving a custodial sentence between 2015 and 2019 were admitted to a neonatal unit afterwards – double the national figure. I happen to live a stone’s throw from the former Holloway women’s prison. At our National Childbirth Trust class, the course leader, reflecting on years of work in the community, told us how keen most women are to leave hospital as soon as possible after giving birth, with the exception of the women from the prison, who wanted to stay as long as possible to delay returning to prison mother-and-baby units, where after 18 months their baby would be taken away from them. This continues to be the fate of women in prisons across the UK. Eleven countries including Russia, Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Portugal, have laws against the imprisonment of pregnant women, but not the UK, despite the fact that more than three in five women enter prisons for sentences of less than six months. The feminist organisation Level Up, along with the groups Women in Prison, No Births Behind Bars and others – including midwives, doctors and solicitors – are campaigning to change that. “Non-punitive responses to women who are traumatised and often in poverty and need support are what we should be striving for, rather than just exacerbating their existing trauma and poverty in prison, and then sometimes taking their children to care,” says Level Up campaigner Janey Starling. At present six out of 10 women in prison are survivors of domestic abuse. This campaign isn’t just about the risks of already traumatised women being forced to potentially endure the trauma of labour behind bars, it is also about prison being an unsafe place for any woman at any stage of pregnancy. Writing under a pseudonym in this newspaper, “Anna”, told of how she was too afraid to leave her cell in case a fight broke out and put her baby at risk, how the food was so unhealthy that it made her sick. She was handcuffed during labour, having waited hours to be taken to hospital. Guards refused to phone her mother or partner and watched her while she laboured. The doctor present was disgusted with her treatment. Other women have spoken of being denied extra food even when they are suffering morning sickness, and of being forced to miss scans or wait for them even when fearing miscarriage. The treatment of these women is inhumane. As for their babies, to be born into incarceration is a children’s rights issue. “We know that the first 24 months of a child’s life are the building blocks for their future and whatever they experience will impact their development, will impact their attachment with the mother,” says Starling. A “short sentence” for a woman is, she points out, a long sentence for her baby, and a lifetime in terms of trauma. In a reflection of its “tough on crime” stance, the government has been resistant to change its policy on the incarceration of pregnant women. Though the Ministry of Justice is keen to emphasise the rarity of cases such as the stillbirth mentioned above, there is a lack of transparency and data, both in terms of how many pregnant women are incarcerated and what their pregnancy outcomes – whether miscarriage or stillbirth – are. Attempts by Harriet Harman, chair of the joint committee on human rights, and others to amend the policing bill to ensure that judges take into account the best interests of children and unborn babies when sentencing, as well as requiring the government to gather and publish data, have been repeatedly rejected. “A young child’s separation from its mother when she’s sent to prison risks lifelong damage to that crucial relationship. Yet, too often, the child is invisible in the court process. This must change,” Harman has said. In solidarity with victims of this cruel system, women with their babies have been protesting against the incarceration of pregnant women, and will do so again on 7 June outside the Ministry of Justice with a mass feed-in (“spoons, boobs and bottles”). They plan to sit and feed their children until the justice minister, Dominic Raab, comes out to speak with them. They have also organised a petition, which can be found here. As a newborn over 30 years ago, I shared a postnatal ward with a baby who was born to a mother incarcerated at Holloway and supervised by prison guards. My own mother remembers it often. We have both long wondered what happened to that mum and that baby, all those years ago, and where they are now. How cruelly they must have been treated. And for what? What’s working: For a poetic perspective on parenthood, I recommend the work of Jack Underwood, whose collection A Year in the New Life and book Not Even This are essential reading for new parents grappling with global uncertainty, though never without a sense of humour. See his poem Fifteen Babies in My Garden: “We were just talking about the ruinous/and beautiful ways we’re going to break/your dumb old heart and totally fuck/your life up”. What’s not: I wrote previously of playing the Adagietto in Mahler’s Fifth to my baby in the womb. Now that the child is here, this piece has the pleasing result of sending him off to sleep almost instantly. Unfortunately, it is only 10 or so minutes long.

5/16/2022,"Two years ago Coleen Rooney’s lawyers urged Rebekah Vardy to seek a mediated solution to her libel claim, warning that the “full public glare” of legal proceedings would not be an enjoyable experience. Instead, Vardy chose to take the case to trial and – after three days in the witness box being cross-examined on highly personal matters – told the high court she felt “bullied” and “manipulated” by the process. It’s not only the two footballers’ wives who have had their personal lives raked over as a result of the libel case – there has also been a litany of other people unwittingly dragged into the proceedings. Peter AndreIn 2004, a 22-year-old Vardy sold a kiss’n’tell story of a one-night-stand with Andre to the now defunct News of the World tabloid. Two decades later, Rooney’s lawyer read out the story in court as evidence that Vardy did not respect people’s privacy. In the process, Andre has had to deal with speculation about the size of his “chipolata” appendage reaching a new audience. Andre has said he has put up with being the “butt of all jokes” for more than 15 years and asked if people would laugh if the comments were about a woman. Danny DrinkwaterWhen the Premier League footballer was arrested for drink-driving after crashing his Range Rover in 2019, it was front page news. But the story had faded from memory – until court disclosures revealed Vardy had attempted to pass details of the car crash to a journalist at the Sun. Vardy said she wanted to leak the story because she abhorred drink drivers – but the court heard how Vardy messaged her agent with the information, and added: “I want paying for this x”. Riyad Mahrez and the 2017/18 Leicester City squadThe court heard allegations that Vardy discussed the Leicester City squad’s dislike of “on strike” player Mahrez with her agent. Rooney’s lawyers suggested Vardy gleaned the information about the state of the dressing room from her husband, the Leicester striker Jamie Vardy, and was then leaking it to the press. Vardy insisted she was just idly gossiping about how the players may feel and had “never discussed [with her husband] whether the lads were fuming”. The journalists discussed by Vardy and her agentThe proceedings have been uncomfortable for some journalists who weren’t even involved in the stories that prompted the libel case – but who have nonetheless found themselves mentioned in court. At one point the high court heard Vardy discussed with her agent whether to leak a story to Sky Sports reporter Rob Dorsett before concluding: “I just don’t want it coming back to me”. In another, Vardy’s agent praised Sun journalist Amy Brookbanks because she “always writes nice stories, does whatever I ask her and gets stories changed that she hasn’t even written”. Caroline WattVardy’s former agent and close friend is the ever-present but never-seen character in the Wagatha Christie trial. It was Watt’s phone that was dropped over the side of a boat in the North Sea soon after a legal request was made to search it – and it is Watt who Vardy now suggests was unilaterally leaking stories from Rooney’s Instagram page to the Sun. After allegedly being “thrown under a bus” at the last minute by Vardy – and amid reports she had urged Vardy to drop the legal proceedings before trial – Vardy said that Watt is too ill to give evidence in the case.",News/UK news,"Peter Andre, Danny Drinkwater and the unwitting collateral of ‘Wagatha Christie’",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/16/peter-andre-danny-drinkwater-and-the-unwitting-collateral-of-wagatha-christie
