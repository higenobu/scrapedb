2/12/2022,"Five years ago, the announcement that Cressida Dick would be the first ever female head of Britain’s biggest force seemed a landmark moment for policing and the nation. The Metropolitan police, one of the most iconic, male-dominated and important institutions in the country, would be led by a woman.  Dick posed for photos with the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who had championed her. “This is a historic day for London and a proud day for me as mayor,” he said. But one senior government official with knowledge of policing expressed surprise: the search had been for a reforming Met commissioner, the official noted. Dick was probably the most conservative candidate available. Even in private she would brook little or no criticism about the most vexed issue of stop and search, when other police leaders would. Dick was the Met insider’s choice and she wanted to boost the force’s sense of confidence and pride. Veteran officers who were about to retire would hear a familiar voice on their police radio as their service ended, thanking them and wishing them well. It was from “Metro 1”, the radio call sign for the commissioner. Thoughtful and warm gestures like that endeared her to the rank and file. But warm words aside, her commissionership was starting to tank with the public, according to regular confidence surveys from the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime. Controversies around race and concern about violence, especially knife crime, buffeted the Met leadership. To tackle violence, Dick ramped up stop and search, which damaged confidence in London’s black communities. One former senior Met officer who knows Dick well said: ”She is unimaginative, just do the old stuff and hard.” Khan, a former human rights lawyer, continued to defend her, despite rising community concern. One former senior former officer said: “I am one of her greatest fans, but she has become tin-eared on a few things. … She looks utterly exhausted, and that leads to poor decisions and you dig in, and it becomes a siege mentality.” September 2021 would be the beginning of the end. She was granted a contract extension by government, which Khan publicly endorsed. In recent days, those close to the Home Office suggested No 10 was in the driving seat, fearing if Dick went, then the Met’s assistant commissioner, Neil Basu, would replace her. Number 10 felt Basu had insulted the prime minister, including in comments made in in a Guardian interview in which he said a no-deal Brexit might harm UK security. But relations between Dick, City Hall and the home secretary were on the slide. A turning point came when Wayne Couzens, the serving Met officer who had kidnapped and murdered Sarah Everard, was sentenced. In City Hall and government, there was an understanding that this was a rare event, that it had never happened before. But the response from the Met leadership horrified them, just as details were finally made public of how Couzens used his police powers and equipment to commit the murder. Instead of the commissioner announcing an inquiry and a multi-point plan of reforms, an assistant commissioner answered questions, suggesting – to widespread ridicule – that worried women could “wave down a bus” if they felt in danger. “You do get overwhelmed, then you are not taking or seeking advice, or seeing danger signs,”, said the former senior officer who is an admirer of Dick, adding: “I know, I have been there.” Priti Patel was angered, senior sources confirm, when after several days Dick decided to launch her own inquiry. The home secretary implored her not to do so, arguing it would lack credibility, and government was planning its own. But the commissioner ignored her. The official data published last September captured how confidence in the Met was plummeting. Asked if “police can be relied upon to be there when needed”, 79% of Londoners had said yes in 2017. Now it was just 61%. Another key measure was at danger level. Asked if “police do a good job in my local area”, only 52% agreed – down from 68%. In 13 of London’s 32 boroughs, it was at 50% or lower. A policing model that operates by consent appeared in trouble. “It is a hard swing to happen to an institution so quickly,” said a senior source. For Khan, the final straw seemed to come on Tuesday last week, when he read the police watchdog report into the Charing Cross scandal. “It had been building up,” said one source. In Khan’s statement responding to the shocking details, he talked about it reminding him of the 1970s and 80s and the police force of his childhood. Dick was summoned last Wednesday to a meeting with Khan. According to a source, they spoke for 90 minutes but “she just did not get it”. Dick felt Khan’s demands for radical and urgent change to the Met’s culture were unwarranted and changes were in hand. The mayor made clear Dick was “on notice” – and had to do more. By Friday she had sent Khan a letter, but the mayor’s team felt there was little or nothing new in it . Discussions between City Hall and Home Office officials were underway, with central government aware the mayor was thinking actively of declaring he had lost confidence in the commissioner. On Wednesday, Khan took to the media. Speaking to the BBC’s Today programme, his tone had changed. In the interview Khan said the commissioner needed a convincing plan by their next meeting. He didn’t say the showdown would be the next day. The following morning, Dick appeared on a phone-in on BBC Radio London, apparently determined to carry on. She insisted she had transformed the Met, accepted there were problems but said she knew how to fix them, and insisted she had led the force “very well”. For those in Khan’s team, the interview was hemlock. The end came within hours. Khan was scheduled to meet Dick at his temporary offices in Southwark, south London at 4.30pm. Khan’s aides contacted the commissioner’s staff. They made clear that Dick’s revised plans for the Met were inadequate. This was relayed to Dick, notorious in the past among colleagues for indecision. Not this time. She told City Hall she would not attend the meeting, and called the home secretary to say she felt she had no option but to quit.",News/UK news,‘She just did not get it’: how Cressida Dick’s support as Met chief unravelled,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/11/how-cressida-dick-support-as-met-chief-unravelled
2/12/2022,"BBC foreign correspondent Jeremy Bowen has spent almost three decades reporting on the Middle East. He is no stranger to division and disputation. But his recent assignment – a three-part series on Radio 4 in which he made “a personal journey through Wales”, the country of his birth – must still have left him a little shellshocked. Bowen, born in Cardiff but domiciled in England and a non-Welsh speaker, did that most dangerous thing – he attacked what he saw as the way the Welsh-speaking minority in Wales dominates the cultural conversation. This argument has not gone down well in the land of his fathers. The Welsh online media has suggested this is the view from Camberwell, where Bowen lives, rather than Criccieth – a journalist’s whistlestop tour of a country he last resided in more than 40 years ago. Fellow BBC journalist and evangelical Welsh speaker Huw Edwards echoed that criticism: “We are all products of upbringing – this take is 1970s Cardiff.” Edwards was even ruder about a parallel attack on Welsh, headlined “Tacsi for a moribund language”, by Jonathan Meades in the current issue of The Critic. “So long as it’s a hobby language it is as harmless as a Sunday painter,” wrote Meades. “But in pockets of Snowdonia and mid-Wales it is a tool not only of communication but of identity and exclusivity, thus of self-harm and curtailment.” To which Edwards curtly responded: “Meades is a brilliant writer and I have enjoyed his work over many years. I can only assume he’s skint. Nothing else can explain this bilge.”  Bowen’s argument is that because bilingualism has become essential for many jobs in Welsh government and media, the English-speaking majority has been disadvantaged and marginalised. Meades is more concerned with what he calls a “totalitarian project” to create a million Welsh speakers (a third of the population) by 2050. At present, only a fifth of the population speaks Welsh regularly. Such views are, however, either outdated or exaggerated. Bowen grew up in an industrial south Wales – English-speaking, male-dominated, culturally monolithic – that no longer exists, and he seems to some extent to be in mourning for that lost communitarian world. Deindustrialisation in the 1980s robbed the south Wales working class of their identity, based on coal, iron and steel. Poorly paid supermarket jobs did not provide an alternative mythology: there is no shelf-stacking equivalent of How Green Was My Valley. As industrial English-speaking Wales was losing its sense of purpose, largely rural Welsh-speaking Wales was discovering a new confidence, thanks to the start of the Welsh-language channel S4C in 1982, the growth of Welsh-medium education and all the jobs requiring bilingualism that came with the devolution referendum in 1997. Westminster was taken aback when Guto Harri, Boris Johnson’s new press chief, gave an exclusive interview to a Welsh language news site Golwg360. But Welsh-speaking Wales is not responsible for the travails of English-speaking Wales, and the two have to find a way to coexist. The survival of Welsh – after centuries of attempted suppression by the English since the Act of Union of 1536 – is a miracle, and every Welsh person, whether or not they speak it, should celebrate that fact. It does not solely define Welshness, but it contributes to its many-sidedness and unquenchable hwyl.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Welsh language: the unmaking and making of a nation | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/11/the-guardian-view-on-the-welsh-language-the-unmaking-and-making-of-a-nation
2/12/2022,"A woman who spread false antisemitic conspiracy theories on Facebook about the Grenfell Tower tragedy has been jailed for 11 months. Tahra Ahmed, 51, said the 72 victims were “burnt alive in a Jewish sacrifice” in a video posted to social media just four days after the tragedy on 14 June 2017.  She was sentenced on Friday after an Old Bailey trial. She was previously found guilty of two counts of stirring up racial hatred by publishing written material. Ahmed, who reportedly worked as a volunteer with victims of the fire, posted her false conspiracy theories “virulently” on Facebook, the court heard. On 18 June 2017, she posted a video on Facebook of the fire and described it as a “Jewish sacrifice”, the court heard. She said: “I’ve been at the scene, at the protest and at the community meetings and have met many of the victims … some who were still in the same clothes they escaped in. “They are very real and genuine, their pain and suffering is raw and deep and their disgusting neglect by authorities continues. Watch the footage of people trapped in the inferno with flames behind them. They were burnt alive in a Jewish sacrifice.” The post linked the fire to an antisemitic conspiracy related to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Prosecutor Hugh French had previously told jurors that an examination of her account unearthed two posts in January and June 2017 that “crossed the line as to what is acceptable in a liberal society”. The earlier post, made on 26 January 2017, also promoted an antisemitic conspiracy theory, jurors heard. A police investigation into Ahmed’s activities was launched following a story in the Times on 11 December 2017, which focused on some of the people who attended public meetings after the tragedy. An examination of Ahmed’s Facebook account revealed a history of antisemitic comments. French also said that, while Ahmed’s Facebook account demonstrated “strongly held beliefs”, the two posts identified were “clear demonstrations of racial hatred”, the Daily Mail reported. “Looking at the language of the posts, the crude racial stereotyping and the insulting tone, the Crown say that you can infer that she posted them either intending to stir up racial hatred [or] that racial hatred was likely to be stirred up”, he was reported to have told jurors. Ahmed, from Tottenham, north London, denied wrongdoing, claiming that her posts were “political”.

2/12/2022,"Gabrielle Rifkind’s point that a willingness to compromise by all sides is the only way out of an unfolding international crisis certainly holds true (I’m a conflict mediator. This is our way out of the Ukraine crisis, 9 February). The USSR did pull its missiles out of Cuba as Rifkind states, but the US reciprocated by withdrawing comparable missiles from Turkey and promised not to invade the island. In 2013 in Ukraine, in the midst of a worsening political crisis, France, Germany, Russia and Poland and the then Ukrainian government led by Viktor Yanukovych and most of the Ukrainian opposition thrashed out a peace plan to take the country forward. The more nationalist elements of Ukrainian society, backed by hawks in the US and elsewhere, rejected the plan and there followed a constitutional crisis, a Russian invasion and dismemberment of Ukraine. No nuclear annihilation for the world, but a real catastrophe for the people of Ukraine.  In the aftermath of all of this, in 2014 and 2015, a second peace plan was put on the table, the Minsk framework, revisited in the last few days and weeks following talk of a Russian invasion. Could its provisions for devolved self-government for the east of Ukraine, alongside the sanctity of Ukrainian sovereignty and territorial integrity, be the prelude to a peaceful transition that would benefit both sides of Ukraine’s body politic? Or will efforts at achieving peace be scuppered by those both inside and outside the country who would rather see the conflict remain frozen until one side takes all?Theo KyriacouHarlow, Essex  In matters to do with war and what people think about it, we need to take account of what they are being told. With the exception of those who support the extremist right, and theocratic ideologies that champion violence and war as part of their creed, the vast majority of people abhor these primitive human traits. But if war is presented as a noble defence against the violence and aggression of an adversary, then people’s abhorrence can be overcome. With regard to the results of this survey of European citizens about Ukraine (Most Europeans want to stand with Kyiv against Moscow poll suggests, 9 February), Hermann Goering’s ominous words, spoken to the US psychologist Gustave Gilbert in his cell at Nuremberg, are worth noting: “Naturally, the common people don’t want war, but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along … voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. This is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and for exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.”Russell CaplanWood Green, London  It may help the tension over Russia’s intentions in Ukraine if there were some acknowledgment among Nato members that there is some basis for Russian suspicion. Memories of the second world war are still very much alive in the country, and their losses in that conflict dwarfed those of other nations. In addition, large tracts of their country were ravaged. It is hardly surprising that there is an unease about having a hostile alliance formed along their border with the rest of Europe.Jill ReadGreenfield, Greater Manchester  Regarding Emmanuel Macron and the “personal assurances” over the Russia-Ukraine crisis he has received from Vladimir Putin (Report, 8 February), didn’t Neville Chamberlain obtain assurances – written, in his case – from Adolf Hitler about Germany invading Czechoslovakia back in 1938?

2/12/2022,"I read with great interest the excerpt from Simon Parkin’s book, Island of Extraordinary Captives, about Britain’s use of internment in the second world war (‘I remember the feeling of insult’: when Britain imprisoned its wartime refugees, 1 February). One extreme case of abuse and insult not mentioned, although it may appear in the book, is the case of the notorious troopship HMT Dunera, which transported “enemy aliens” to internment camps in Australia. My father, Sigmund Kirstein, was among the internees: a man in his 50s who had managed to reach Britain in 1939. The conditions on the Dunera and the abuse of the internees are a matter of record. Several of the crew were court-martialled after a journey of 57 days with 2,740 men incarcerated in a vessel meant for 1,600 troops.  The internees suffered physical abuse, verbal insults, shortage of food and water, and, according to my late father, the worst of all was that there were only 10 toilets for more than 2,000 men. The internees’ possessions were looted, and anything not considered to be of value was thrown overboard, leaving the men with just the clothes they stood up in. Many of the men were orthodox Jews, and their prayer books and prayer shawls were also consigned to the waves by their guards. On arrival in Australia the men were interned, mostly at Hay in New South Wales, in very harsh conditions but, like the internees on the Isle of Man, they rallied and did their best to overcome the physical and psychological hardships. There is, or was, a Dunera “alumni” association and a few of the internees remained in Australia. My father returned to Britain to be reunited with his wife in Llanelli, but carried the trauma of his ordeal throughout his life. It is good to see that a book about the dark chapter of “enemy aliens” during the second world war is now published.Yehudit Kirstein KeshetBe’er Sheva, Israel  The letters (4 February) in response to Simon Parkin’s article show how those fleeing Nazi persecution were subject to imprisonment and humiliation by the UK authorities. My own family case adds a further twist to those of your correspondents. My father, fleeing Nazi persecution in occupied Vienna, was granted asylum in this country with the status “category C – not to be interned”. But this counted for nothing and he was imprisoned in Lingfield Park racecourse stables. This was a tad better than his brother, who was imprisoned on the Isle of Man and then transported to Australia under almost slave-ship conditions on HMT Dunera (hit by a torpedo that, luckily, did not explode). The British government acknowledged Hitler’s Anschluss and, although they were Austrians, my father and his brother were considered to be Germans, unlike in the US, which considered my father to be stateless in his visa application. Thus, when my mother (born in north Wales of Welsh parentage) married, she became an “enemy alien” and her rights were severely curtailed, ending her career as an opera singer. These restrictions included having to report to the police at frequent and regular intervals, not to own a bicycle or a car, and to report her intention to change her address. Her British nationality was not restored until 1948, three years after the war ended. All of these abuses and indignities followed from a campaign by the rightwing tabloids and the resulting internment decision, for which Winston Churchill carries personal responsibility.Tony MayerSwindon, Wiltshire  The use of internment started much earlier than during the first world war (Letters, 4 February). The British government practised it from at least 1709. Starting in 1708, the official propaganda machine oiled by Daniel Defoe seduced tens of thousands of Palatine peasants and artisans with promises of land to uproot their families and come to England. They were welcomed by internment in makeshift camps on Blackheath and Camberwell Green. Unable to cope or to control the xenophobic mobs who attacked the invited “guests”, the government scattered them to Ireland, to increase the Protestant population; North Carolina, as part of a deal with property sharks; and New York, where they were forced into indentured labour as part of an impossible scheme to produce naval stores. Families were ripped apart and a large number died. When the project failed the government simply turned them loose and they were left to their own devices. I imagine the US should be grateful: among those who were sent across the Atlanic were the Rockefellers, Wanamakers, Rittenhouses, the ancestors of Elvis Presley, and John Peter Zenger, who laid the basis for the freedom of the press.Dr Charles PosnerLavenham, Suffolk  John Green’s letter rightly asks the question as to why refugees from Nazi oppression were interned when they were clearly not a threat. My father was one such refugee who was interned in Seaton and, later, at camps in Canada. The events are even worse than portrayed by John Green. In addition to those interned in British camps in 1940, the British sent over 2,000 mainly Jewish refugees to Canada. They did this knowing that they were not a threat to the UK, while lying about the danger they presented to ensure that they would be taken. Most refugees from Nazi oppression sent to Canada were classified as safe by British tribunals; however, Britain had forced the hand of the Canadian government to accept a certain number of “dangerous refugees” from the UK and could not lose face by not sending the numbers previously quoted. Instead of “dangerous Nazi paratroopers” arriving in Canada, a large contingent of Jewish and other refugees from Nazi oppression disembarked there. While in Canada, refugees were initially interned in the same camps and sometimes the same huts as Nazi prisoners of war, and also faced antisemitic treatment from their Canadian captors. After the sinking of the Arandora Star, the British government realised their mistake and public opinion turned. Large numbers of refugees started to be returned to the UK in 1940; however, not all were released until 1943. This terrible blunder by the UK government was in no small measure caused by a kneejerk reaction to public hysteria whipped up at the time by the Daily Mail and Daily Express. As they say, some things never change.Simon JamesIlston, Swansea  The photographs of the internment camp used to illustrate Simon Parkin’s article and the letters responding to it brought back memories of the time I lived in that road on the outskirts of Liverpool in the early 1940s. My mother and I were allocated a house in Belton Road, Huyton following the destruction of our family home by enemy bombing. By the time we arrived at what was to be our home for the next eight years, all external signs of internment had been removed. Inside the house was very different. The refugees had taken to expressing their frustration at their plight by illustrating the bedroom walls with graffiti, messages in various languages and illustrations. It was left to my mother, with the help of neighbours, to clean and redecorate the house. Where the earlier residents were transferred to was never revealed to my mother.Tony ShortMaghull, Merseyside  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/12/2022,"Julian Coman is spot-on (Politicians may have forgotten about ‘community’, but British people haven’t, 7 February). We know that humans develop as individuals within a social environment, initially (at least in the west) within their families but always within a wider community. Communities of one sort or another make us who we are. The “I” develops from the “we” – hence the fundamental human need to belong. We edited a book – The Politics of Attachment, published in 1996 and including contributions from soon-to-be Labour ministers – that explored ways in which public policy could build on the power of attachment and the need to belong that remains as powerful as ever.  The Labour party, with its emphasis on solidarity and community ties, has long known this, but it should now apply this thinking to a more individualistic 21st century. Communities in the UK have been enriched by people from many different backgrounds, but the one element that everyone, regardless of background, can share is place – whether defined by street, neighbourhood, town, city or country. Almost all of us live in a place where we can make relationships – glancing acquaintances, neighbours and friends – that bridge divides and root us to where we live. We should harness the power of places and people’s attachment to them to build a “radical politics of place”, as Coman advocates.Jane Roberts and Sebastian KramerLondon  Julian Coman’s distinction between “I” and “we” is neatly put in Dante’s Purgatorio: “For by so many more there are who say ‘ours’, so much the more of good doth each possess.” It’s true.Dan EdwardsNorthampton  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/12/2022,"Team GB’s skeleton equipment has been panned by slider Matt Weston and the 2014 Winter Olympic bronze medallist John Jackson after another dismal day in the Yanqing National Sliding Centre. Britain have won a skeleton Olympic medal at every Games since 2002, including three in Pyeongchang four years ago – thanks in part to a huge advantage in helmet, skin suit and sled technology.  But they are certain to go away empty handed this time after a shocking performance in both the men’s and women’s event. On Friday Weston and Marcus Wyatt finished 15th and 16th in the men’s competition, more than four seconds behind Germany’s gold medal winner, Christopher Grotheer. In the women’s competition Pyeongchang bronze medallist Laura Deas and Brogan Crowley were also well off the pace in their first two runs, ending up 21st and 22nd respectively of the 25 competitors. Deas is already 1.8 seconds behind leader Jaclyn Narracott of Australia. Deas said: “It’s certainly not the outcome I wanted. I came to the start block in a great frame of mind. I can’t tell you now why the speed wasn’t there. We’re going to have to go back and look at all of it and try and come back stronger tomorrow.” Jackson, who won bronze in the four-man bobsleigh in 2014 and is now commentating for the BBC, said it was the equipment – and not the sliders – that was to blame. “This is what we have seen with the British equipment, it’s just absolutely draining speed all the way down. That is the problem Laura had. It’s a problem we have seen with the guys as well. This has been the feature of their season. This experience isn’t going well. It is going to be a tough Games for British skeleton.” Weston concurred, saying: “I think there’s quite a few questions that need to be raised but equipment is definitely going to be one of them. Something’s not right. I couldn’t have done much more today. I’m really happy with how I slid. We’ve got to learn some lessons about what’s happened here. For the moment, it’s not where I want to be.” The third and fourth heats of the women’s skeleton are at 12.20pm and 1.55pm UK time on Saturday. There was a mixed day for Team GB’s men curlers in Beijing, as an 8-3 victory over Norway in Friday’s evening session made up for a 9-7 defeat by the US in the morning. After three days of competition the British curlers lie joint third in the standings. The team’s skip Bruce Mouat said he believed there was better to come from them, saying “this is only our second game in a few months, so [I’m] still getting back to playing with the boys and just need to figure out a few more things.” The women’s curling team have given themselves little room for further error. A 9-7 defeat by South Korea means that they have only won one of their first three matches, with Eve Muirhead saying the loss was “a frustrating one to take. But we’ve got to move on, we’ve only played three games and we’ve been in this position before.” Their next match will be against an unbeaten United States team at 12.05pm (UK time) on Saturday. Briton’s Andrew Musgrave and Andrew Young finished 46th and 51st in the men’s 15km classic cross-country skiing, which was won by Iivo Niskanen of Finland.

2/12/2022,"Faced with a rising tide of acrimony, rage, and online crankiness, New Zealand has launched a nationwide campaign to try to calm its citizenry down. Over the summer, pastel posters began cropping up around the cities, asking New Zealanders to “dial it down a notch,” “read it before you hit enter,” and “comment with dignity”. Cartoon characters entreat keyboard warriors to take a breath, and consider “what would your mother say?”  The Human Rights Commission – which is an independent crown entity – launched the campaign late last year. Human rights commissioner Paul Hunt says it was prompted by “a rising tide of division and antisocial behaviour.” “Complaints and inquiries have gone off the richter scale. People are really stressed and angry,” Hunt says. The commission has had more complaints about abuse in the past seven months than its previous record annual high, he says. The monthly rate of complaints had almost doubled, from 525 to an average of 956. The “Dial it Down” campaign hoped to remind New Zealanders, Hunt says, that they “can have vigorous disagreement without losing the plot.” Since mid-2021, there has been a significant rise in the quantity and extremist tone of chatter on social media, says Kate Hannah, a principal investigator at research institute Te Pūnaha Matatini. Researchers were seeing a higher overall volume of violent language and imagery – including increased references to lynchings, sexual violence, misogynistic language and profanity. That tone had become commonplace on mainstream platforms, she says. “[One] thing that seems really shocking to me is the level of vulgarity. I know that sounds prudish – but I’m not a prude, I’m a kiwi, I swear. We’re not Americans,” she says – referring to a generally higher antipodean tolerance for swearing. “The other thing that’s shocking is [seeing this] from people on Facebook who look like – or they appear to be like – my mum or my aunty, … in their 60s or 70s, using the C-word,” she says. “That is not necessarily something that we’re used to.” Hunt believes that much of the uptick can be blamed on pandemic stress, and the long, grim months of lockdown. “Two years of the pandemic is very, very tough. So people are struggling financially, emotionally, mentally, they feel powerless, and they’re struggling to cope. And sometimes people do lash out at something else – or someone else.” A large current of abuse has flowed toward journalists – who are often the communicators of pandemic policy, infuriating both those who see them as government lackeys or as over-critical of the government’s response. “The block button has been hot this year,” says Maiki Sherman, chair of the parliamentary press gallery. “I think everyone in the media would agree that we’ve seen an increase in online abuse.” Some of that abuse was extreme, she says. The protesters gathered outside parliament this week were fond of telling journalists that they would soon be “put on trial” and killed for treason. “Just got told I’m going to be executed by a woman holding a sign saying ‘love is the cure’,” 1 News reporter Kristin Hall remarked on Twitter on Wednesday. “Reporters have thick skins, we’re used to dealing with confrontation, it’s part of the job. But it’s escalating to a point where there is real concern, given the types of threats that are being made,” Sherman says. The increase in abuse, Sherman says, was not exclusively the domain of anti-government or anti-vaccine factions – heated jibes were coming in from across the political spectrum. “A huge part of it is to do with the pandemic and vaccinations. But I think also in general, there has been a slow growth over the last few years and over the last two decades, with social media growing itself, and so people have more and more been given this tool to have a voice.” Researchers have found that Māori women were more likely to be subjected to abusive comments – a dynamic Sherman had observed. “I have noticed it targeted at other Māori woman, certainly.” Accounts of abuse recorded by the commission were not restricted to one side of the vaccination debate. Some complaints, Hunt says, were from people who had mask exemptions due to disability, and were shouted at by members of the public who perceived their lack of a mask as indication of a broader anti-health-regulation stance. Simultaneously, an increasing number of frontline workers tasked with enforcing vaccine passes or masks were subject to abuse from customers who refused to comply. He speculated whether sharpening rhetoric was driven by some deeper fissures that emerged as the country’s policies have shifted to emphasise greater freedoms for the vaccinated. “Before, we were all in the same boat. Now, actually, we’re not in the same boat. We’re not being treated the same. Now, I think [the policy] is warranted, I’m not against it – but there is this new dimension … and we’ve got to deal with it properly.” A publicity campaign would not be sufficient to calm some of the uglier elements of the national conversation, Hunt says, but there was hope it would help. “Of course, it’s a very complicated picture. We’re not suggesting our campaign is going to solve it – these things are complicated and they require multi dimensional responses. But we thought this campaign had a role to play.”",News/World news,‘What would your mother say?’ New Zealand urges citizens to wind back online rage,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/what-would-your-mother-say-new-zealand-urges-citizens-to-wind-back-online-rage

2/12/2022,"More than half the £1.7bn paid by the government to politically connected “VIP” companies to supply PPE in the pandemic was spent on equipment that has not been used, according to new figures. The total value of unused PPE was £2.8bn for 1.9bn items, according to newly released figures from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).  The DHSC did not explain why the PPE was unused but it was not all defective. Last week the department revealed that PPE worth £750m was never deployed because it had passed its safe use-by date. Huge quantities were stockpiled after the government over-ordered in the pandemic. The proportion of unused PPE is significantly higher for contracts processed through the a so-called VIP lane – 59% of the £1.7bn ordered from them – than for other firms awarded contracts through the standard procurement route. Of the £10.4bn committed to non-VIP companies for PPE, 17% or £1.8bn has not been used. DHSC released the figures and the names of companies whose PPE has gone unused in response to a freedom of information request pursued by Spotlight on Corruption. In June last year, 1.9bn PPE items were described by a minister as having been put in the “‘do not supply’ [to the NHS] category” but it is possible that some has since been cleared for use. The department’s list includes 552,100 unused items, costing £8.5m, supplied by Meller Designs. The firm, which was awarded a total of £164m in PPE contracts, was co-owned at the time by David Meller, who has donated nearly £60,000 to the Conservative party since 2009 including £3,250 to support Michael Gove’s party leadership bid in 2016, a campaign on which Meller worked as chair of finance. In November the DHSC revealed that Gove’s office had referred Meller’s company as a potential PPE supplier, and it was then processed through the VIP “high priority lane” for companies referred by Tory MPs, ministers, peers or health officials. On Friday the company declined to comment. Another firm on the unused PPE supplier list is PPE Medpro. It was awarded two contracts worth a total £203m after the Tory peer Michelle Mone initially referred the company in May 2020 to her fellow Tory peer Theodore Agnew, then a Cabinet Office minister responsible for procurement. The DHSC’s newly released list says that 25.5m items ordered from PPE Medpro, worth £124.7m, have not been supplied to the NHS, which appears to include the 25m sterile surgical gowns ordered in June 2020 for £122m. PPE Medpro have insisted that they supplied the gowns to the technical specification required. The DHSC has said it is in dispute with the company that it is seeking to resolve via mediation. SG Recruitment, referred by the Conservative peer Peter Gummer who is a director of its parent company Sumner Group Holdings, told the Guardian that its PPE, 2.4m items costing £26m, was on the list because it had been awaiting checks but had now been cleared for use in the NHS. PPE costing £1bn in total stated not to have been passed to the NHS – 476m items such as face masks, gowns and other vital equipment – was supplied by 25 companies whose contracts were processed via the VIP lane, Spotlight on Corruption’s analysis of the DHSC’s list has revealed. The high priority given to these companies, some newly formed or with no track record in medical products, meant they were given a more attentive personal service at the start of the procurement process, previous reporting has found. The DHSC publication follows a statement in parliament by the then health minister, James Bethell, in September that as of 10 June last year, “1.9bn items of [PPE] stock were in the ‘do not supply’ category”. Bethell was replying to a parliamentary question from crossbench peer David Alton, who has pressed in the Lords for details of the waste associated with PPE procurement. The VIP process was ruled unlawful in the high court last month following a challenge by the Good Law Project; Mrs Justice O’Farrell ruled that the government had failed to give equal treatment to all companies offering to supply PPE.",News/World news,Half of PPE procured by UK using ‘VIP’ companies has not been used,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/half-of-ppe-procured-by-uk-using-vip-companies-has-not-been-used
2/12/2022,"The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has been secretly collecting Americans’ private information in bulk, according to newly declassified documents that prompted condemnation from civil liberties watchdogs. The surveillance program was exposed on Thursday by two Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico alleged that the CIA has long concealed it from the public and Congress.  The pair sent a letter to top intelligence officials arguing that the program operates “outside the statutory framework that Congress and the public believe govern this collection”. Wyden and Heinrich added: “It is critical that Congress not legislate without awareness of a … CIA program, and that the American public not be misled into believe that the reforms in any reauthorization legislation fully cover the IC’s collection of their records.” The two senators, frequent critics of the CIA, said they are not allowed to reveal specifics about what type of data has been subject to bulk collection and called for more details about the program to be declassified. Large parts of the letter, which was sent in April 2021 and declassified on Thursday, and documents released by the CIA were blacked out. The CIA and National Security Agency (NSA) have a foreign mission and are generally barred from investigating Americans or US businesses. But the spy agencies’ sprawling collection of foreign communications often snares Americans’ messages and data incidentally. The senators’ disclosure triggered fresh concerns about privacy protections. Patrick Toomey, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said: “These reports raise serious questions about the kinds of information the CIA is vacuuming up in bulk and how the agency exploits that information to spy on Americans. “The CIA conducts these sweeping surveillance activities without any court approval, and with few, if any, safeguards imposed by Congress.” Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor who blew the whistle on the mass surveillance of Americans’ telephone records, wrote on Twitter: “You are about to witness an enormous political debate in which the spy agencies and their apologists on TV tell you this is normal and OK and the CIA doesn’t know how many Americans are in the database or even how they got there anyway. But it is not ok.” And Justin Amash, a former Republican congressman, tweeted: “Rogue agencies like the NSA, FBI, and CIA are a more serious threat to liberty in America than the enemies they claim to protect us from.” There have long been concerns about what information the intelligence community collects domestically, driven in part by previous violations of Americans’ civil liberties. The FBI secretly recorded the conversations of Martin Luther King; the CIA investigated whether the anti-Vietnam war movement had links to foreign countries. On Thursday the CIA released a series of redacted recommendations about the program issued by an oversight panel known as the privacy and civil liberties oversight board. According to the document, a pop-up box warns CIA analysts using the program that seeking any information about US citizens or others covered by privacy laws requires a foreign intelligence purpose. Additional documents released by the CIA revealed limited details about a program to collect financial data against the Islamic State terrorist group. That program also has incidentally snared some records held by Americans. Kristi Scott, the agency’s privacy and civil liberties officer, said in a statement: “CIA recognizes and takes very seriously our obligation to respect the privacy and civil liberties of US persons in the conduct of our vital national security mission. CIA is committed to transparency consistent with our obligation to protect intelligence sources and methods.” Intelligence agencies are required to take steps to protect US information, including redacting the names of any Americans from reports unless they are deemed relevant to an investigation. The process of removing redactions is known as “unmasking.” Wyden and Heinrich have previously pushed for more transparency. Nearly a decade ago, a question Wyden posed to America’s spy chief presaged Snowden’s revelations about the NSA’s mass surveillance programs. In 2013 Wyden asked then-national intelligence director James Clapper if the NSA collected “any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.” Clapper initially responded, “No.” He later said, “Not wittingly.” Later that year Snowden revealed the NSA’s access to bulk data through US internet companies and hundreds of millions of call records from telecommunications providers. Reports in the Guardian and Washington Post generated worldwide controversy and new legislation in Congress. Clapper would later apologise in a letter to the Senate intelligence committee, admitting that his response to Wyden was “clearly erroneous”.",News/US news,Declassified documents reveal CIA has been sweeping up information on Americans ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/11/declassified-documents-reveal-cia-collecting-information-americans
2/12/2022,"Motorists face the return of record high prices at the pumps as global oil markets continue to climb towards $100 a barrel after a slowdown in output from the Opec oil cartel. British drivers will now pay 151.21p a litre of diesel after pump prices on Thursday climbed above the previous all-time high of 151.10p a litre in November last year, compounding the national cost of living crisis.  Meanwhile, petrol prices have moved to within 0.05p of their November record to 147.67p a litre across the country, according to the AA, and are already above the 147.72p a litre UK record in London, the south-east and East Anglia. Households and businesses face rocketing costs this year due to the steadily rising market price of gas and oil which is causing economy-wide inflation across the UK. The cost of oil has increased by more than 60% in the last 12 months, from about $60 (£44) a barrel last February to highs of $98 (£72) in the last week. After a brief slump the global oil price has resumed its march towards $100 a barrel, reaching $92.42 (£68) a barrel at midday on Friday. The rise has been driven by growing demand for crude following the easing of Covid-19 travel restrictions, as oil production among the world’s biggest suppliers has struggled to keep pace. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia, which is the world’s third-biggest oil producer, have also fuelled higher oil prices. The International Energy Agency (IEA), which is considered the world’s energy watchdog, on Friday blamed Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for failing to produce enough oil to meet the quotas set out by the Opec oil cartel and its allies. The pair could help to calm volatile oil markets if they pumped more crude, according to the IEA, after Opec missed its oil production targets by 900,000 barrels a day in January, which helped bring about the global oil market surge. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have the most spare production capacity and could help to relieve dwindling global oil inventories that have been among the factors driving prices towards $100 a barrel and boosting inflation worldwide, the IEA said. “These risks, which have broad economic implications, could be reduced if producers in the Middle East with spare capacity were to compensate for those running out,” the Paris-based agency said in its monthly oil report. In the UK record pump prices are expected to pile on the cost of consumer goods which will cause more pain for struggling households as they brace for a 54% hike in gas and electricity bills from April this year. “Businesses warned this week that they have no option but to pass on higher costs to consumers. The latest jump in the price of diesel, the workhorse fuel of business and haulage, ramps up that inflationary pressure even more,” said Luke Bosdet, the AA’s fuel price spokesperson. Motoring group RAC warned petrol and diesel retailers to keep a lid on pump prices, after charging higher than necessary profit margins through December. “At the moment, we can’t see any justification for a big leap in forecourt prices so we’re urging retailers to continue taking normal margins on each litre they sell. This will ensure drivers, many of whom depend on their vehicles, aren’t forced to pay even higher prices,” said RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams.",Lifestyle/Money,UK motorists face record fuel prices as global oil costs rise,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/11/uk-motorists-face-record-pump-prices-as-global-oil-costs-rise
2/12/2022,"Ridley Scott is set to team with Amazon to create a new live-action sequel series to Blade Runner. Blade Runner 2099 will follow on from Denis Villeneuve’s 2017 sequel Blade Runner 2049 to further expand the world originally created by Philip K Dick in his 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?  Scott directed the much-loved 1982 adaptation Blade Runner and is set to executive-produce the new series with the potential for him to also direct. In November, Scott confirmed that the show was in development and a pilot had been written. The series was reportedly brought to market last fall with Amazon pouncing and developing it further as a priority. It will mark the second Blade Runner television show after last year’s anime series Blade Runner: Black Lotus which is set in 2032. Reviews have been mixed, with the AV Club’s Sam Barsanti writing that “there isn’t really a compelling hook here aside from the Blade Runner bit in the title”.

2/12/2022,"Joe Biden has held a hastily arranged call with other Nato and EU leaders as the US warned that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could come before the end of the Winter Olympics on 20 February. Biden’s call to allies followed a situation room meeting at the White House to discuss the latest intelligence on the Russian military buildup, which, according to diplomats, has raised the level of alarm within the Biden administration.  The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Friday there were “very troubling signs of Russian escalation”. “We’re in a window when an invasion could begin at any time – and to be clear, that includes during the Olympics,” Blinken said. The White House said Biden was calling transatlantic leaders “to discuss our shared concerns about Russia’s continued buildup of military forces around Ukraine, and continued coordination on both diplomacy and deterrence”. A European diplomat said that the US had asked for the urgent call with Nato allies and the heads of the EU council and commission, because “it seems like they have some new intelligence they want to share that has made them skittish”. Ukraine invoked a clause from the Vienna document, an international agreement on military transparency, demanding that Russia provide information about its military manoeuvres in neighbouring Belarus within 48 hours. Vice-Admiral Nils Andreas Stensønes, the head of the Norwegian intelligence service, said Russia now had 150,000 troops massed around Ukraine, and said the decision on whether to attack rested with Vladimir Putin. “Now it is first and foremost up to President Putin if he chooses to do so,” Stensønes said. “It is difficult to say whether it is probable or not probable, because it is solely up to the Russian president to make that decision.” He added that Russians “have all they need to carry everything out, from a minor invasion in the east to minor attacks here and there in Ukraine, or a complete invasion, with, possibly, an occupation of all or parts of Ukraine”. Western intelligence agencies largely agree that Putin has now put in place enough troops to attempt an invasion, a sentiment reflected in warnings in the last 24 hours from Biden and the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson. Nevertheless, they continue to believe no final decision by the Russian leader has been made. A number of invasion scenarios are considered possible, but there is a prevailing belief that any military intervention ordered by Putin would be designed to achieve regime change in Kyiv. That could see a lightning attack, aimed at encircling Kyiv, with the intention of forcing the collapse of President Zelenskiy’s government, and trying to install a pro-Russian regime without urban warfare. Johnson emphasised on Thursday that any invasion would amount to a massive miscalculation by Putin because Ukraine would “fight and they will resist very strongly”. Any belief in the Kremlin that a Russian intervention would be welcome by anything other than a tiny minority is mistaken, British ministers stress. The raised alert follows the failure of several diplomatic initiatives to lead to a breakthrough. Reports suggested that much of Emmanuel Macron’s more than five hours of talks with Putin in Moscow on Monday, was taken up by lengthy historical lectures from the Russian leader, with very little substance on current events. Accounts from German officials on “Normandy format” talks in Berlin between Russian, Ukrainian, German and French officials had been difficult and offered no prospects of defusing tensions. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, is due to visit Moscow to see Putin on Tuesday, but his spokesman said he was taking no new diplomatic initiatives with him. The head of the foreign affairs committee in the Bundestag, Michael Roth, a former minister, said on Twitter: “Russia has effectively annexed Belarus militarily. What are being called “exercises” is really the encirclement of Ukraine, and a concrete threat to Poland and the Baltic States. The situation remains dangerous.” After a meeting with his Russian counterpart in Moscow, the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said he had been assured that Russia had no intention of invading Ukraine and that he had made clear to Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, that any invasion would have would have tragic consequences. Wallace that Russia’s deployment of forces gave it a range of options including an invasion, and added “it was vital not to allow room for a miscommunication or miscalculation”. During a visit to Australia, Blinken warned that the repercussions from a Russian invasion would spill into Asia, where the US and its allies are increasingly in confrontation with China. “If we allow those principles to be challenged with impunity, even if it’s half the world away in Europe, that will have an impact here as well – others are watching,” Blinken told reporters in Melbourne. “Others are looking to all of us to see how we respond. So that’s why it’s so important that we have this solidarity: that we do everything possible, through diplomacy, to try to avert a conflict and prevent aggression – but equally, to be resolute if Russia renews its aggression.”",News/World news,Ukraine crisis: Biden talks to allies as US warns Russia could invade ‘at any time’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/11/biden-ukraine-us-russian-invasion-winter-olympics
2/12/2022,"Representatives from more than 100 countries have committed to measures aimed at preserving the ocean from human harm, including stepping up the fight against illegal fishing, cutting plastic pollution and better protecting international waters. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, hosting the high-level session of the One Ocean summit on Friday, said 2022 was “a decisive year, and we should take here, in Brest, clear and firm commitments.”  The US climate envoy, John Kerry, said it was “the ocean that makes life on Earth possible, produces more than half of the oxygen we breathe – and even that is at risk. The ocean and climate are inextricably linked. They’re one and the same.” The 27 EU states and 16 others agreed to pursue a global agreement by the end of the year to regulate the sustainable use of the high seas – waters lying outside any one country’s jurisdiction – and preserve their biodiversity. “We are so close, but we need to push [to get the treaty signed in 2022],” the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told the summit. The hope is for a fourth and final round of UN negotiations to reach agreement in New York in March. Peggy Kalas, of the High Seas Alliance, said the announcement was “a timely and important commitment to protect our global commons”. But François Chartier, of Greenpeace France, said activists “expect concrete measures on conservation mechanisms and governance”. While 30 more countries also signed up to the so-called 30x30 coalition, which launched in January 2021 and aims to protect 30% of the world’s land and sea by 2030, “clarifications are lacking on the level of protection for marine areas covered”, Chartier said. France said it had exceeded the goal of classifying 30% of the land and marine spaces under its jurisdiction as protected areas after the creation of the world’s second largest marine protected area, around its southern and Antarctic lands. The US said it would support opening talks at the UN for an international deal on plastic pollution, throwing its weight behind the EU27 and about 10 other countries. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) joined the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the French, German, Italian and Spanish development banks in a “clean oceans initiative” to reduce the 9m tonnes of plastic that end up in the ocean each year, pledging €4bn of finance by 2025. Half a dozen more countries joined a “plastics economy global commitment” backed by the UN environment programme to help governments and businesses transition to a circular economy aimed at recycling or reusing 100% of all plastics. In an effort to further curb illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, which accounts for almost a fifth of global catches, six more countries committed to ratifying the International Maritime Organization’s Cape Town agreement setting safety standards for fishing boats. Two more said they would ratify an agreement controlling fishing activities at ports where catches were landed, and several EU member states agreed to deploy their navies in overseas operations to step up surveillance of illegal fishing. Meanwhile, 22 European shipowners committed to new targets to cut underwater noise, emissions, residues and oil discharge, 18 ports around the world undertook to reduce dockside emissions, and Mediterranean countries together with the EU said they aimed to turn the Mediterranean into a low sulphur emission zone by 2025. France and Columbia announced a global “blue carbon” coalition to help finance the restoration of coastal ecosystems such as salt marshes, seagrass beds and mangroves that are capable of absorbing and storing large quantities of carbon. French officials said the summit, attended in person or virtually by heads of state and government from 41 countries, marked the starting point of a series of key international meetings focused on the oceans, including the UN Ocean Conference in Lisbon in June and Cop27 in Egypt in the autumn.",News/Environment,More than 100 nations take action to save oceans from human harm,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/11/more-than-100-nations-take-action-save-oceans-from-human-harm
2/12/2022,"Those who have seen Quentin Dupieux’s strange comedy Deerskin, with Jean Dujardin as a murderous would-be cinéaste obsessed with the sartorial superiority of his fringed deerskin jacket, or any of the film-maker’s other wacky adventures, will have an idea what to expect of this latest romp. They may also be justifiably unsure whether to find his movies irresistible or insufferable. I am still undecided in some ways. Incredible But True has a wacky premise that Dupieux very possibly had no idea how to develop. And yet I found myself laughing quite a lot of the time. The sheer silliness and zen pointlessness is entertaining. It’s a film with something of Charlie Kaufman or Spike Jonze or early Woody Allen, mixed with a French version of the Carry Ons. Alain Chabat and Léa Drucker play Alain and Marie, a couple of middle-aged house-hunters being shown a shabby place in the suburbs. The estate agent perplexes the pair by excitedly showing them the house’s special feature: a hole in the basement that, through an interesting Escher-style quirk, leads down into the upstairs bedroom. You wind up higher than you were before. And not only that: the hole in the basement has a second, sensational magic power that astonishes them. The house is a metaphysical wonder at an affordable price. They buy it and Marie becomes obsessed with their house’s “duct”. Meanwhile, the couple’s near-neighbour, who is also Alain’s boss, has a problem: Gégé (Benoît Magimel) has had an electronic penis installed using untested Japanese technology and it is far from trouble-free.  The funny-but-exasperating quality of the film is typified by the way that Dupieux leaves so many of the implications untested and unexplored. What happens if you go the wrong way through the tunnel? A Hollywood director might be concerned to hammer out these ideas. Not Dupieux. He just blithely swings on to the next daft gag. New things happen and ridiculous developments briskly unfold in cheerfully preposterous montages. Is this an absurdist meditation on the cruelties of ageing? A Buñuelian satire on the world of bourgeois property ownership? Or just a shaggy dog story? (A dog features actually, and also a cat.) Somehow this film contrives to be more watchable than many of the grander offerings at Berlin, from bigger names.

2/12/2022,"Britain’s competition watchdog has provisionally cleared Sony Music’s $430m (£312m) deal to buy Awal – the artist service company that has worked with musicians including Little Simz, Nick Cave and Finneas – after initially raising concerns the takeover could lead to worse deals for artists or increase prices. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said that an in-depth investigation into the deal, prompted by concerns it could be bad for the music business, has concluded that it will not substantially lessen competition in the UK now or in the future.  The CMA had been concerned that the takeover would mean the loss of another independent player in the sector, which is dominated by the big three – Sony Music, Warner Music and Universal Music. However, it has provisionally concluded that there are plenty of other independent “artist and label” service providers, companies that provide a cheaper “DIY platform” for artists offering promotion, marketing and distribution, and that these offer better royalties and copyright ownership than working with traditional record labels. The major record labels have developed their own artist and label services, and artists can also turn to independent record labels that offer better terms than the music industry giants. “We have carefully assessed whether this merger will lead to negative outcomes for the market, artists and, ultimately, music fans, now and in the future,” said Margot Daly, chair of the CMA’s inquiry group. “Our provisional finding is that the deal is not likely to affect competition in a way that will reduce the choice or quality of recorded music available, or increase prices. We think that a combination of other major labels and independent providers will continue to closely rival Sony, so our provisional decision is to clear the merger.” The CMA will publish its final report on the deal by 17 March. A spokesperson for Sony Music Entertainment said: “Our investment in Awal will deliver real benefits for artists and consumers, amidst intense competition at every level of the music industry. We look forward to continuing to work with the CMA throughout the final stages of their review.”",News/Business,Sony’s takeover of Awal provisionally cleared by UK regulator,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/11/sony-awal-takeover-provisionally-cleared-uk-regulator-cma
