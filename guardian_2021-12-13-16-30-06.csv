12/13/2021,"The largest and most important event in the mathematical calendar will take place next July in St Petersburg. The International Congress of Mathematicians is a quadrennial gathering at which many of the subject’s most prominent thinkers give lectures and the winners of maths’ most prestigious prize, the Fields Medal, are announced. As part of the build-up to the event – which is expected to attract about 5,000 mathematicians from all over the world – the organisers earlier this year ran an online maths competition for students and the general public. Below are the first three questions from this test.  Russia has long been a world leader in mathematics outreach, having pioneered the idea of maths circles (informal maths clubs where students often try to solve problems in groups) and competitive maths olympiads. Today’s three puzzles are all brilliant examples of the Russian style: they test logical reasoning rather than taught mathematical skills. The first one, in particular, is a classic. 1. Pet swap A cat is sitting on the table and a tortoise is crawling on the floor directly beneath it. The distance from the cat’s ears to the top of the tortoise’s shell is 170 cm. Alena switched her pets around. Now the distance from the cat’s ears to the top of the tortoise’s shell is 130 cm. What is the height of the table? 2. Circular thinking Volodya is running around a circular track at a constant speed. At two of the points on the track are two yellow marks. When he started his run, Volodya was closer to the first yellow mark for 2 minutes, then he was closer to the second yellow mark for 3 minutes, and then he was closer to the first yellow mark again. How long does it take Volodya to run one full circle? 3. Path of glory Olga must walk through the 3x3 grid below left, moving either horizontally or vertically from cell to cell, and not entering any cell more than once. Below right shows one possible path. If Olga writes down the digits she passes in order during this path, she would get the number 84937561. What is the largest number possible it is possible for Olga to write down during a path through the grid? I’ll be back at 5pm UK with the solutions. Meanwhile, NO SPOILERS. Thanks to the ICM 2022 for letting me use the puzzles. You can find more about the event here. Sources: 1: Maths clubs folklore. 2. Moscow Mathematics Olympiad 2015 3. Math Fest 2012.

12/13/2021,"The nation’s most isolated state will fully reopen its borders on 5 February after almost two years sealed off from Covid and the world. Premier Mark McGowan announced on Monday its plans to allow interstate and international travellers to enter Western Australia without quarantine from midnight 5 February when the state was expected to hit its 90% fully vaccinated target.  But the premier warned that once the state’s hard border was eased, unvaccinated or “high risk” arrivals will still be required to quarantine for 14 days – unless they are under 12 or exempt on medical grounds. “I’m confident that this is the right time and the right way to take this important step,” McGowan said. “West Australians have lived a normal life inside our Covid-free bubble and nearly 2 million people have done the right thing and gotten vaccinated. The announcement comes on the same day Scott Morrison said that visa-holding skilled workers and students will be allowed into Australia from Wednesday. The announcements provide light at the end of the tunnel for many businesses that have struggled to survive from a lack of seasonal workers and a long-awaited chance for families and loved ones to reunite. Travellers to WA must be double vaccinated and return a negative PCR test 72 hours before departure. The test must then be retaken on arrival in WA. McGowan also outlined precautionary measures that will come into effect once the border reopens. From 5 February face masks will be required on public transport, taxis, at airports, on flights, and in hospitals and aged care facilities. Proof of vaccination is required for entry into larger events, with 1,000 or more patrons, such as nightclubs and Perth’s casino, and all interstate and international travellers will need a G2G travel permit and be expected to use the SafeWA app. McGowan warned that targeted lockdowns could occur if there was an outbreak and that the rules will be reviewed one month after 5 February. More than 1.7M West Australians, or 80% of its population aged 12 years and over, are now fully vaccinated. Children aged five to 11 are expected to have access to the Pfizer vaccine in WA from 10 January. While a national plan backed states reopening at 80%, McGowan has stood firm against criticism from the PM to keep borders closed until WA reached a 90% double-vaccinated target for over 12s. The decision, McGowan said, was based on WA health department modelling that an extra 200 lives will be saved by delaying the reopening. It is the same target set by Tasmanian’s Liberal leader Peter Gutwein and borders there will open on 15 December. WA will remain isolated from nearly every state and territory for the festive season but will have no restrictions, such as density limits or face masks, during Christmas and the school holidays break. The state has not had a Covid case since late June.Tourism Council WA chief executive officer Evan Hall said the industry had lost $4b and 40,000 jobs since the borders were first closed in April 2020. “The most important thing about getting the date today is so we can now take bookings,” Hall said. “Once the border comes up, then we can send a message that we are open and we can take a booking for an Easter holiday, a major blockbuster event – we want to get Taylor Swift in and some international rugby – and you can’t do that without a date. “We can start telling the airlines that we are open.” Last week, McGowan announced that $185M would be spent reconnecting WA to the world and luring tourists and workers back to the state. WA’s economy depends on a continual stream of seasonal workers. For businesses, the history-making border closures caused some to go bust because of a lack of staff. Hall says that the first wave of people coming in will be reuniting with family and the need is for working holiday makers and international students to come in and help save tourist venues in the regions. “After that, we are interested to see how much international leisure (travel) takes off.” WA Liberal leader David Honey said that WA was struggling under a massive skills shortage from doctors to teachers and that people in the state were getting restless. “There is a definite change in the community and people have been saying, give us a date and time, you can understand that the business community have been getting more agitated by the day,” Honey said. He said that he was concerned not enough people were educated about the need for third vaccinations – or booster jabs. “One of the reasons we are opening up after Christmas is because we were so far behind in vaccinations compared to other states.”",News/Australia news,Western Australia to reopen border on 5 February after almost two years sealed off from the world,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2021/dec/13/western-australia-to-reopen-border-on-5-february-after-almost-two-years-sealed-off-from-the-world
12/13/2021,"Adam McKay calls it his “freakout trilogy”. Having tackled the 2008 financial crash and warmongering US vice president Dick Cheney in his previous two movies, The Big Short and Vice, McKay goes even bigger and bleaker with his latest, Don’t Look Up, in which two astronomers (Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio) discover a giant comet headed for Earth, but struggle to get anyone to listen. It is an absurd but depressingly plausible disaster satire, somewhere between Dr Strangelove, Network, Deep Impact and Idiocracy, with an unbelievably stellar cast; also on board are Meryl Streep (as the US president), Cate Blanchett, Timothée Chalamet, Tyler Perry, Mark Rylance, Jonah Hill and Ariana Grande. It has been quite the career trajectory for McKay, who started out in live improv and writing for Saturday Night Live, followed by a run of hit Will Ferrell comedies such as Anchorman, Step Brothers and The Other Guys. “The goal was to capture this moment,” says McKay of Don’t Look Up. “And this moment is a lot.”  Was there a particular event that inspired Don’t Look Up?Somewhere in between The Big Short and Vice, the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] panel and a bunch of other studies came out that just were so stark and so terrifying that I realised: “I have to do something addressing this.” So I wrote five different premises for movies, trying to find the best one. I had one that was a big, epic, kind of dystopian drama. I had another one that was a Twilight Zone/M Night [Shyamalan] sort of twisty thriller. I had a small character piece. And I was just trying to find a way into: how do we communicate how insane this moment is? So finally, I was having a conversation with my friend [journalist and Bernie Sanders adviser] David Sirota, and he offhandedly said something to the effect of: “It’s like the comet’s coming and no one cares.” And I thought: “Oh. I think that’s it.” I loved how simple it was. It’s not some layered, tricky Gordian knot of a premise. It’s a nice, big, wide open door we can all relate to. Dick Cheney, the financial crash, planetary destruction … these are not subjects most people would consider comedy material.Yeah! I don’t know how you’ve been experiencing the past five years, but when I talk to my friends the basic thrust of the conversation is: “What the holy F is going on?” And usually we swing between laughing at just how ridiculously over-the-top horrible it is and genuinely being frightened. When we were making the movie, I happened upon a fascinating book called Deep Survival. The author [Laurence Gonzales] studies why people survive insane accidents like getting lost at sea or lost in the woods, and one of the biggest things he found was that a lot of these people kept a dark sense of humour. I think there’s something really – I hate to use a woo-woo word – but, healing about that. So yeah, I think laughter has got to be a part of how we deal with this. How did you assemble such an incredible cast?I had a couple of people I wanted right from the jump. Like, I wrote the roles for Jennifer Lawrence and Rob Morgan [as a sympathetic Nasa scientist]. I sort of had Meryl Streep in mind, but you never dare to think that you’re going to get her. When she signed on, it then became just a cascading effect. And then when Leonardo DiCaprio came in, I realised there was this happy accident, where this stellar cast was actually enforcing the point of view of the movie: that we’re constantly distracted by celebrity and bright colours, and low news versus high news, and contrarian points of view. Of course, it didn’t hurt that they all happen to be brilliant actors. So yeah, it got slightly embarrassing. At one point I almost found myself apologising to my director friends. You do at least manage to make both Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence look terrible.Well, thank you! I take that as a pure compliment. They had to be the opposite of the people that you’d want to chuck on the most popular talkshow in America, so, yeah, we did some hard work on that. And it’s testament to them, as big, giant movie stars, that they were willing to play into that. I even said at one point to Jennifer: “Those bangs could look a little better if you wanted to.” And she was like: “No, I like ’em.” So yeah, they were down for the cause. This is a work of fiction, but how much did you draw on real people for the characters?All the characters are kind of an amalgam. I’ve been tracking the last five or six years what’s been happening to the scientists in the States who are under political attack, and it’s sometimes kind of funny to watch because some of them aren’t made for giant PR tours. What you’ve seen are these climate scientists having to go front and centre and take on a billion-dollar industry of misinformation from fossil fuel companies and attacks from extremists and having people call for them losing their jobs. And I felt for them. It’s not what they’re built to do. Politics and big tech are in the firing line, but as with the Anchorman movies, your main target here seems to be the media.I think what happened, especially in the US, was everything became a sales exchange. Everything became a “customer is always right” interaction. And I think that goes across politics, it goes to broadcast media and, to some degree, print journalism. The only way you can stay alive is to maximise profits. And I’ll date myself, but I remember when that wasn’t entirely the case! I remember when broadcast journalism was about the esteem and doing good journalism. But it became part of the entertainment culture. So now we’re in this very dangerous place where it’s hard to tell people bad news. How does a society function when bad news is not an easy sell, and everything is about selling? We certainly see, er, a new side of Meryl Streep (no spoilers, but her character appears naked at one point). Was she up for that?She is fearless. And yes, that is a body double. But you know who had a problem with it? Leo [DiCaprio]. Leo just views Meryl as film royalty … although maybe royalty is not a compliment … but as such a special figure in the history of film. He didn’t like seeing her with the lower back tattoo, walking for a second naked. He said something to me like: “Do you really need to show that?” And I was like: “It’s President Orlean; it’s not Meryl Streep.” But she didn’t even blink. She didn’t even bring it up. Talking of politicians, did you ever get any reaction from the Cheneys over Vice?I did. I got two reactions. A friend of Christian Bale was at a party and said to Dick Cheney: “I know Christian Bale.” And Cheney looked up at them and said: “Well, you tell Christian Bale he’s a dick.” And Christian’s friend laughed, and Cheney said: “I’m not kidding.” And then the second reaction, and you’ve got to judge if this is me thinking too much of our movie, but I think it’s pretty odd that Liz Cheney just came out for gay marriage. And I do know, from seeing her timeline on social media, a lot of people gave her a hard time for betraying her sister [Mary, who is a lesbian]. For a Republican candidate in the state of Wyoming to come out publicly in support of gay marriage … there is no political advantage to doing that. I just found that very curious. You come from an improv and live comedy background. Do you still work like that? It sometimes looks as if nothing was planned in your Will Ferrell comedies.Oh, it’s definitely not planned. On the day, you just never can fully anticipate what it’s like to see a beautifully designed set and perfect wardrobe and hair. There’s just always something inspiring about that moment. So the actor, whether it’s Will or John C Reilly or Adam Scott or Paul Rudd or Kathryn Hahn, will get inspired by the moment. I get the couple of takes as written, then I’ll say: “OK, let’s start screwing around.” And I’ll throw out an idea, and they’ll take it and go somewhere else, and essentially what happens is we’re all writing together. One of my favourite lines from any movie I’ve ever done happened in Anchorman, when Paul Rudd says of his cologne, Sex Panther: “60% of the time, it works every time.” Jonah Hill is able to improvise a whole monologue. Like in this movie, [when his character is speaking at a political rally] he does a “prayer for stuff”. That was entirely Jonah, entirely improvised. You and Ferrell ended your professional partnership in 2019 after 13 years. What happened?I think it was a matter of two things. Part of it was, I really love producing. Will likes producing, but he likes to keep it kind of manageable, and I really just was all for [doing] a lot of different stuff: podcasts, documentaries, series, all different kinds of movies. And I think we got to a point where he was getting a little bit tired of driving past billboards for stuff that we had produced, and he didn’t even know we had produced it. I think also, there was a shift in the kind of comedies that Will and I had been making. They didn’t feel … you know, I wasn’t maybe as excited by those. Does it feel as if you couldn’t make comedies such as Anchorman or Step Brothers today?Yeah, I think without a doubt, it felt like that was over. Given what we’re up against. It feels a little ridiculous to make those comedies now. But I still love great comedies. So I’m trying to play with: “What is the language now?” Because the way I’m experiencing the world, it’s a ridiculous farce, but at the same time, it’s also terrifying. When the president of the United States floats the idea of ingesting bleach, and then people in the country actually ingest bleach … well, that’s beyond the biggest slapstick comedy you could ever write. So I feel like in these last three movies, I’m trying to find that blend. Can that blend exist? I’m not entirely sure it can. But that is what we’re going after. You still seem to have a lot of irons in the fire as producer, including the show of the moment, Succession. Did you know you were on to a winner with that series?Sometimes you know. And this was one of those ones where I totally knew. We put it together. We shot it. But when I really knew was when I started watching episodes, two, three, four and five, and I stopped watching them like a producer and started just enjoying them. And that’s when I started telling some people in my circle: “I think we got a good one here.” To the point where Jesse [Armstrong, the show’s creator], who is a much more restrained person than I am, was telling me: “Will you please shush up?” Getting back to Don’t Look Up and the looming apocalypse. Is there any cause for optimism?Well, the one big optimism I have is that we have the science. It’s right in front of us, for God’s sakes. We have renewables, they have some interesting carbon-capture technology, we need to be chucking trillions of dollars at this. So I do know that if we got on our horse, science could solve this. We could do it. What’s scaring me is just how scattered and all over the place and chasing-our-tails most of civilisation is right now. So I’m not optimistic in the near future. But I am optimistic in the future. Don’t Look Up is in cinemas now and on Netflix from 24 December.",Arts/Film,Adam McKay: ‘Leo sees Meryl as film royalty – he didn’t like seeing her with a lower back tattoo’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/13/adam-mckay-leo-sees-meryl-as-film-royalty-he-didnt-like-seeing-her-with-a-lower-back-tattoo
12/13/2021,"Q I have been trying to sell my leasehold flat in Portsmouth but I’ve had two buyers pull out because the estate agent has told them incorrect information about the lease. The flat has 85 years remaining on the lease, so it’s getting towards the point where any buyer would reasonably think about a lease extension. The agent has been telling them that the lease has 100 years on it. When the buyers found out the correct information from their solicitors they both pulled out of the purchase. I assumed the first time that it was simply a miscommunication, so I made a point of checking with the agent that the second buyer had the correct information. The agent assured me that the buyer knew the facts but that wasn’t true either. Is there anything I can do about their repeated lack of truthfulness causing sales to collapse?TC A There are two things that you can do. First, you can make a formal complaint about your agent, using the estate agent’s in-house complaints’ procedure, which, under the Code of Practice for Residential Estate Agents, you must be made aware of. Second, you can – and should – change agents. From what you say, it appears that your current agent is not only not complying with the industry code of practice but he or she is also breaking the law.  Putting your general cynicism about estate agents aside, I would hazard a guess that most try very hard not to commit a criminal offence when going about their daily business, so finding one who doesn’t provide misleading information (in breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations) should be relatively easy. But when you do find a new agent, it would be worth checking that they will follow the guidance in the code of practice, which says that where leasehold properties are concerned, an agent “should include basic key information such as service charges, ground rent, the length of years remaining on the lease and any known special conditions”. The code also says that information given to buyers – whether in writing or orally – “must be accurate and not misleading”, so I think you can take it as read that law-abiding estate agents will do their best to provide buyers with accurate information about a property. A third thing you could do would be to alert both sets of failed buyers to the fact that they, too, can make use of the in-house complaints procedure. If they can show that they wouldn’t have put an offer in if they had known that the lease had only 85 years left on it they may be able to get compensation for costs incurred in pursuing the purchase before they found out the truth.

12/13/2021,"The early experiences children have with money can shape their financial behaviour as adults, according to a study published by the UK government’s MoneyHelper service. By the age of seven, the University of Cambridge study found, most children are capable of grasping the value of money, delaying gratification and understanding that some choices are irreversible or will cause them problems in the future. The research suggests children who are allowed to make age-appropriate financial decisions and experience spending or saving dilemmas can form positive “habits of the mind” when it comes to money. This could lead to a lifelong improvement in their ability to plan ahead and be reflective in their thinking about money, or they may learn how to regulate their impulses and emotions in a way that promotes positive financial behaviour later in life.  Juliette Collier, a national director of the charity Campaign for Learning, says it is worth giving children as young as three or four their own coins to handle, spend and save. “Once they are old enough not to put it in their mouth, then give them some money,” she says. “If, for example, they end up wanting to spend that money on sweeties, then make it clear they can’t spend the money on something else. Let them make choices, and experience the consequences.” There are lots of free resources you can use to teach young children about money at home. Valuesmoneyandme.co.uk, a website created by the credit reference agency Experian, offers free online books and interactive quizzes aimed at primary school aged children that explore interesting ethical questions about money and real world financial dilemmas. FunKidsLive.com hosts a short money podcast aimed at children, and there are lots of free games online (see topmarks.co.uk/maths-games/5-7-years/money or natwest.mymoneysense.com). If you prefer board games, Money Match Cafe or Pop to the Shops by Orchard Toys are educational and imaginative, while Cheeky Monkeys subtly provides useful financial lessons about the consequences of avarice and risk-taking. Finally, do not underestimate the value of playing games such as “going to the shops” at home with real coins. Be sure to set a budget. Collier suggests taking photos of different items in your home that can then be classified into necessities and luxuries, triggering a discussion about what money is for. She also recommends talking about costs that may be hidden – such as the fact heating, electricity and water are not free – and involving children in attempts to save money. For example, you could challenge them to help you do a “no spend” day or make a recipe from the Love Food, Hate Waste website, using only ingredients you have in the cupboard. You could use these activities as a springboard for discussions about how adults need to prioritise what they spend money on and how difficult that can be if you feel tempted to buy something you cannot afford. The charity Child Poverty Action Group suggests you ask your child to imagine a child the same age as them, and talk to them about what that child might miss out on if their family doesn’t have money. Its spokesperson Kate Anstey says: “Speaking to children about poverty can help to raise awareness and understanding of poverty and inequality. It might seem like a difficult topic to broach but teachers who talk about poverty in their classrooms find that children actually cope with it very well.” One of the best places to teach children about money is a shop. “Being able to handle money and buy something yourself is very special: it builds up your confidence with money,” says Dr Ems Lord, the director of the NRICH maths project at the University of Cambridge. If you pay with a contactless card, explain how it works – that although you are not using coins, the money is still coming out of your bank account – and discuss the groceries you buy. Why might you choose to spend more on Fairtrade chocolate or free-range eggs? Are the more expensive products always better quality? Ask them whether they would like to do a blind taste test at home to check whether they can tell the difference between different-priced brands. Is it worth the difference in price? Be on the alert for BOGOFs (buy one, get one free offers) and complicated discounts. Teach children how to compare different deals. “It’s absolutely essential that we teach children about money in context,” says Lord, a former maths teacher. “Encouraging children to work out the cost of shopping and comparing offers so they understand the value of goods is an essential life skill.” Helping your children to master estimating is also very important, she says. “It helps children to develop a real feel for numbers so that they can easily spot when they’re being overcharged and avoid making costly mistakes.” Open a Junior Isa for your child and buy a few shares in a supermarket or restaurant chain you visit regularly with them, suggests John Lee, the author of Yummi Yoghurt, a book about investing aimed at teenagers. That way, when you go there, you can explain to your child that you both have a “vested interest” in supporting that business and will hopefully one day get a reward, in the form of a dividend, if the business does well. You could also talk to them about how you choose other funds for their ISAs and the impact you hope those investments might have on society or the environment. “The important thing is to involve your child and give them an awareness of the companies that you’re buying shares in,” Lee says. Charity shops are particularly good places to take a small child to spend their weekly pocket money. They often find a bargain and you can use the opportunity to discuss the power of their pound: how does it make them feel, knowing they are supporting a good cause as well as getting something for themselves? Point out the positive impact on the environment of buying secondhand and, when you get home, look up how much the item would have cost new and talk to them about how many more weeks it would have taken to save up for it. Ask them why they think people donate to charity shops and whether they would like to do so with their old toys: how valuable will these toys be to the charity? What difference could their donation make to someone’s life?",Lifestyle/Money,How to teach children the real value of money,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/dec/13/how-to-teach-children-the-real-value-of-money
12/13/2021,"We are having a nightmare with Furniture Village, and, looking online, it seems there are many others in the same boat. In July we ordered a table and chairs from the store’s website, paying £1,170. At the time, we were told delivery would be in mid-October.  After placing the order, we decided we wanted to buy additional chairs and bar stools. We called several times but were left on hold for an hour each time and eventually gave up. Now we are trying to get the original order delivered. The company emailed us on 19 October saying it was having problems, and the order would be delivered in mid-November. By 21 November, there was been no communication and no delivery. I requested callbacks but have had no response. Furniture Village has had £1,170 of our money for more than four-and-a-half months, and we have no product and no way of communicating with the company.CH, Walthamstow Ouch! The online reviews do not make great reading, with many reporting similarly long waits for their orders. The retailer isn’t alone – the whole furniture sector is having problems. I asked the company about your case, and it quickly looked into it and has just delivered your items. To apologise, it has refunded your delivery fee and offered a 10% discount on the extra chairs – should you still wish to buy them. “Soaring demand for raw materials and shipping containers, combined with port congestion, depleted workforces and reduced factory capacity, is creating a perfect logistical storm, which has resulted in delays to a number of our customers’ orders,” it says. It also said it has since beefed up its customer care team to address the lack of communication you experienced. I called up this week and did get through after waiting for about 14 minutes, so maybe things are improving. In the meantime, those trying to buy furniture and other similar items may want to stick to what is actually in stock. Right now, a promise that a bed or sofa will be delivered on time appears to be a bit of a guess, and probably should be treated as such. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

12/13/2021,"Solar parks could provide habitats for wildlife – and particularly bumblebees – to flourish, if managed in the right way, benefiting farmers and nature, new research suggests. There are already 14,000 hectares (35,000 acres) of solar parks in the UK, in which arrays of solar panels are installed over a large area, and an estimated 90,000 hectares will be needed. Yet the parks have attracted controversy over claims they are ugly, blight productive land and harm nature.  If solar park owners were encouraged to use the land to sow wildflowers alongside the solar panels, they could become valuable habitats for pollinators, research from Lancaster University has found. Managing them in this way would boost bumblebee numbers beyond the borders of the parks, to about 1km (0.6 miles) away, benefiting farmers who rely on bees to pollinate their crops. One simulation run by the study group found four times as many bees in a solar park managed as a wildflower meadow than in one based on turf grass. Hollie Blaydes, a researcher at Lancaster University who will present the findings at a conference, said: “Our research suggests that the management of vegetation within the solar parks is really important. Solar parks managed as a meadow act as bumblebee habitat that is rich in flowering plants. Management to create floral-rich bumblebee habitat could be one of the simplest ways to support bumblebees on solar parks.” Despite appearances, the large arrays of solar panels offer many advantages over other tracts of land in providing a habitat for pollinators. “The characteristics of many solar parks mean they could be ideal places to create this bumblebee habitat,” said Blaydes. “Solar parks can occupy large areas of land, and while some of this is taken up by solar panels and other infrastructure, this typically only disturbs 5% of the ground. Large areas of land are therefore available to create bumblebee habitat … and [the solar parks] are often located in agricultural habitats where much bumblebee [population] has been lost. Establishing habitat on solar parks may therefore provide bumblebees with resources where they are most needed.” Post-Brexit agricultural subsidy systems could be used to give solar park owners an incentive to use their land as meadows rather than turf, and the reduced need for cutting grass and other interventions could spell small savings in management costs. The way such parks are currently owned and managed, with the management often outsourced to external companies by the landowners on short-term contracts, typically of two years, also presents difficulties that well-designed government incentives could overcome. Blaydes said: “Our findings provide the first quantitative evidence that solar parks could be used as a conservation tool to support and boost pollinator populations. If they are managed in a way that provides resources [such as flowers], solar parks could become valuable bumblebee habitat.” The research, which is still unpublished, will be presented on Monday to at a conference held by Ecology Across Borders.",News/Environment,"Solar parks could be used to boost bumblebee numbers, study suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/13/solar-parks-could-be-used-to-boost-bumblebee-numbers-study-suggests
12/13/2021,"Writing about racism is tiring and – if we’re going to be honest – not all that much fun. By definition, it’s an exploration of pain and suffering. We saw that when Azeem Rafiq spoke in parliament about the racism he had encountered in Yorkshire cricket. It entails spending a good deal of time with the very worst impulses of humanity. It requires trying to understand the mindset of people who have no interest in understanding you. We see that every time a rightwing politician or media outlet tries to justify racism under the deceitful banner of “anti-wokeness”.This is doubly true in the case of sport, which for the most part is a place where we go to feel uplifted, perhaps even seek temporary refuge from the world and its complex, maddening problems. And so often in this job it’s impossible not to feel a little churlish. You know that thing you love? That you’ve loved ever since you were a child? That source of simple, happy, incorruptible memories? Turns out it’s actually morally bankrupt beyond measure!Then there are the days when you feel like you might just be getting somewhere. An article that changes a few minds. A revelation or news story that forces the powerful to reflect. Or occasionally a moment that simply knocks you sideways. Perhaps one of the most quietly moving episodes of the sporting year came in an otherwise entirely forgettable pre-season friendly at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in August, when Bukayo Saka was introduced by Arsenal as a substitute.As you will probably be aware, Saka missed the crucial penalty for England in the Euro 2020 final against Italy at Wembley, and in the days afterwards was subjected to a vicious and sustained wave of racist abuse. Now, as he stepped on to enemy turf at the home of his club’s biggest rivals, the Tottenham fans cheered his every step: a show of solidarity and kinship across tribal lines that felt shocking in its defiance.It was a gesture that said: actually, fuck the rivalry for a moment. Some things mean more. And you need to know that we know that. Every so often there are days when it feels like nobody is listening and nobody is learning, when there is precious little left to cling to. Well, cling to that.  English cricket is never short of stories. The Ashes will dominate the sports news cycle either side of Christmas. This year’s T20 World Cup is a prelude to the joys of next year’s T20 World Cup, and to the 50-over World Cup the year after that. In the current rush to balance schedules, to gorge on stored-up TV rights deals, every year is World Cup year right now, every couple of months another step on the franchise carousel. These are the headlines. But the real story of English cricket is, as so often, elsewhere. In the last few weeks, Rafiq’s refusal to walk away from his experience of institutionalised racist abuse at Yorkshire County Cricket Club has gone from a noise off on the sports pages to questions in parliament, reputation management in the Nike boardroom and a state of emergency at English cricket’s grandest county. This story is just beginning. But we can promise that with the help and the input of readers we will continue to tell it in the pages of Guardian Sport, and to keep trying to push it forward to the next step. Rafiq is a hero. His bravery lies not just in telling his story, but in being willing to tell it until people listen, and doing so even as his character is smeared and his motives questioned. In the face of massed public pressure, there has been a sudden willingness to listen in high places. But one thing is certain. This isn’t even close to being over, or solved or packaged away, no matter how many reports or statements the England and Wales Cricket Board might throw at it, no matter how many layers of Yorkshire’s management are peeled away. We still see entire sections of society underrepresented in the professional game, starved of opportunity, excluded by habit and structures, and often more or less invisible at management level. If Rafiq’s courage tells us one thing, it is that those with an investment in the status quo will respond only to public pressure. That is hopefully where Guardian journalism can have an impact. I was at the London Stadium to watch West Ham host Tottenham in the Premier League a few weeks ago. It can be a difficult fixture for a Jew to attend. Tottenham have often been the target of antisemitic taunts and I wasn’t particularly surprised when I heard a nearby West Ham fan launch into a chant of: “We’ll be running round Tottenham with our willies hanging out, singing I’ve got a foreskin, haven’t you …” It was a jarring moment, a reminder that discrimination in football remains an issue despite repeated efforts to kick it out: and there was more to come when West Ham travelled to face Genk in the Europa League last month. The footage of supporters taunting a Jewish man on a plane to Belgium was another punch in the stomach. Unfortunately, these incidents remain all too common, and 2021 has become something of a watershed for sport and racism. Last year, Kick It Out, football’s anti-discrimination charity, warned that a “shocking” increase in reports of racist and homophobic abuse in professional football was just the tip of the iceberg, and sadly it has become a part of our job as football reporters to ensure that the issue is covered properly, sensitively and extensively. We have all experienced that sinking feeling while sitting in a press box – the moment when we realise that a section of supporters in the ground are aiming racial abuse at a young black footballer. It happened when England went to Budapest to face Hungary, but it is crucial to note that racism is not merely a problem in foreign countries: it was deflating for Gareth Southgate to have to devote part of his debrief with the media after the Euro 2020 final to talking about racism. But we have to talk about it. At the Guardian, it is a topic we continue to cover rigorously. In 2019 we published a wide-ranging report into the rise of racism in football, at grassroots level and in the professional game, and we explored the problem again earlier this year. In 2021, our columnists have written again and again about an issue that, far from going away, appears to becoming more entrenched. We built up to England’s opening game at Euro 2020 against Croatia by interviewing Labour leader Keir Starmer about racism in football and we have heard from several figures inside and outside the game about discrimination, among them former players Lilian Thuram and Anton Ferdinand, and poet Benjamin Zephaniah. Chris Hughton spoke to us about the challenges faced by black managers and our award-winning podcast, Football Weekly, recently broadcast an interview with the former Liverpool and England winger John Barnes about his experiences of racism. The hope is that persistent reporting will have a positive effect; that it will change attitudes in the stands and increase diversity at the top of the game. It is our duty to put pressure on authorities who have often seemed blase about the issue. It is no longer merely important that we keep talking and writing about racism in football. It is a moral obligation.",Sport/Sport, Reporting on racism: ‘There are days it feels as if we are getting somewhere’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/13/racism-sport-reporting-positive
12/13/2021,"The first few years of life weren’t easy for Leo*. His mother was severely dependent on drugs, as were other members of his family. There were periods of neglect, and he was taken into the care of his local authority while still a very young child. Now 16, Leo lives in semi-independent accommodation. But his difficulties haven’t evaporated. Often he has felt lonely and unwanted. On several recent occasions, Leo has been the subject of a missing persons report. When visited by caseworkers after returning, conversation has repeatedly turned to his mental health struggles. He just feels low most of the time. Leo’s story is not unique, just as the UK’s missing persons crisis is nothing new: 170,000 people are reported missing every year, at a rate of one every 90 seconds. More than 70,000 are children and the majority, like Leo, boomerang in and out of sight repeatedly, perhaps living in care or unstable households. Though it’s rarely possible to pinpoint one single cause leading to a disappearance, poor mental health is very often a significant contributing factor. One in five children subject to a return interview with the charity Missing People has disclosed information about mental health issues.  This much was true long before the pandemic. But the events of the past 18 months have only accelerated existing trends. In a report published by the social business and charity Catch-22, the link between children’s mental health and missing episodes is made explicit. Its own data has shown that mental health was a factor in a third of all children’s missing incidents reported between April 2020 and April 2021. The highest figures came between October and December 2020, in the teeth of lockdown and school closures. But even after the end of restrictions, rates have remained alarmingly high. When someone returns after they have been missing, there is an invaluable chance to understand some of what led to the disappearance in the first place. And most missing people – whether adults or children – do return. The latest figures suggest that 90% of missing children are back in sight within 48 hours. Statutory guidance in England and Wales now states that every one of these returned children should be offered an independent “return home interview” (known as return discussions in Scotland). They are supposed to offer the chance of an intervention, conducted by a trusted non-police body, such as Catch-22 or Missing People. Leo’s story is one of many. Take 15-year-old Alice*. Her relationship with her parents was already fractious, and lockdown exacerbated matters. Alice had quickly become isolated and found remote learning difficult. Already living with several neurodivergent conditions, she had put herself under huge pressure to conceal her mental health struggles from her family. Even after the loosening of restrictions, arguments have persisted – mostly centred on schoolwork and seeing friends. Unable to cope at home, Alice has repeatedly gone missing and has begun to self-harm. Clearly there is something deeply broken, in a year when record numbers of children and adolescents have been referred to mental health services in England. Between 2020 and 2021, NHS data shows there were 527,339 referrals in total, up 33% from 2019. The wider UK picture is just as troubling. In early December, it was revealed that nearly 2,000 young people in Scotland had been waiting more than a year for an appointment with child and adolescent mental health services – a rise of 106% from 2020. Statistics hardly represent the lives of increasingly vulnerable young people like Leo and Alice. For one consultant child psychiatrist in Liverpool who spoke recently to the BBC, the consistent severity of self-harm is the worst they’d ever seen. In times of severe distress, the likelihood of going missing only increases. The majority of missing young people might return “safe and well”, but there are many who don’t. One in seven of those who completed return home interviews with Missing People had been sexually exploited. Crises rarely emerge fully formed overnight. They tend to build over years. Cuts to children’s mental health services are nothing new, even if the effects of the pandemic have brought things to an unignorable boiling point. It’s why one of Catch-22’s key recommendations involves timely access to professional support. After all, collating scrupulous data from returnees is one thing; turning it into action is quite another. Our society is riven by deep inequalities, and the world of missing people is no different. For children living with poor mental health, in poverty or flitting in and out of the care system, the risk of disappearance is significantly increased. These are not academic questions – the stakes could hardly be higher. This summer marked a first in the history of Catch-22’s missing services. A child with significant mental health problems had been reported missing and was later found to have taken their own life. They were just 14 years old.

12/13/2021,"‘This, for me, is the most beautiful place on Earth,” Paolo Sorrentino told Filippo Scotti, the actor playing the director’s younger self in his latest film, as their 1980s Riva speedboat chopped the waves of the Bay of Naples. Their view stretched from the precipitous peninsula of Sorrento all the way west towards Posillipo. The two promontories flank the sprawling port city, offering a warm embrace to all those who disembark there. Sorrentino’s new film, the Hand of God, opens with that same view: the sun-mottled bay, whose peace is disturbed by the sound of four Rivas as they speed towards the shore. The film is both a love letter to, and a portal into, Paolo Sorrentino’s Naples. In cinemas now and on Netflix this week, The Hand of God sees the Academy award-winning director return to his home city for the first time since One Man Up, his 2001 debut. Sorrentino tells the story of his own coming of age, up to the moment when his life is shattered by the death of his parents in a tragic accident. Sorrentino’s story is a tale of great grief, loss and perseverance, set in a middle-class part of Naples, a far cry from the impoverished neighbourhoods shown in the city’s other recent portraits: Elena Ferrante’s My Brilliant Friend or the mafia-focused Gomorrah series.  Following the teenage life of Fabietto Schisa, a teenage Sorrentino-esque figure, the director maps out a rarely seen Naples, and his film serves as a refreshing guide to the city. Unlike the historic centre, with its ancient, working-class character, the Vomero neighbourhood feels more genteel and modern. Perched high above the city, it’s rarely visited by tourists. Nicknamed la città alta (the high city), most of Vomero comprises residential neighbourhoods built in the late 1960s and 70s. Low-rise housing blocks, such as those along Via San Domenico where Sorrentino grew up, envelop the craggy hill as it rises steeply above the sea. At the heart of Vomero, however, is the Liberty-era Piazza Vanvitelli, an elegant octagonal square lined with cafes. Here the Fabiettos of today spill out of the nearby Istituto Salesiano secondary school Salesian Institute – Sorrentino’s alma mater – gossiping and smoking Camel Blues on benches. Leading off the piazza are wide avenues lined with department stores, bookshops and independent cinemas. In the cross streets are restaurants such as the historic La Gorizia 1916, a Vomero institution that opened during the first world war to help feed the famished neighbourhood, serves a quintessentially Neapolitan menu. Dishes are a step above some of the trattorias in the historic centre, which have begun to lose their way with the influx of tourists. Inhabitants of the lower city make an occasion of going “up” to Vomero, climbing the steep Pedamentina staircase and enjoying the views of the bay from Castel Sant’Elmo at the top. Viewed from a distance of two decades, Sorrentino’s Naples – as portrayed in the film – is pricked with both melancholy and a rose-tinted nostalgia. From his youth he remembers the Amalfi coast, the vine-laced foothills of the Mount Vesuvius and the Apennines on the city’s doorstep. An early scene in The Hand of God sees the extended Schisa family enjoy a long family meal in Massa Lubrense, on the Sorrentine Peninsula – a locals’ favourite, often missed by tourists making a beeline for Positano. The lunch captures that charming and comedic Neapolitan spirit. An uncle of Fabietto’s produces a watermelon given to him as a thank-you for “a favour” and describes it as special “because it comes directly from Cava de’ Terreni”, while his grandmother – milk dripping down her chin – gorges on a vast bulbous mozzarella, which is no doubt made in one of the reputable dairies in nearby Agerola. In the afternoon, they head out for a jaunt on a wooden gozzo boat, bobbing about between the mainland and the Faraglioni rocks of Capri, while the women stay home to make passata, from a crop of Vesuvian tomatoes. The quintessential Italian scenes of lazy lunches with eccentric family is just one seasonal facet of Vomero. Another is zipping off to the mountains in nearby Abruzzo for winter weekends or the settimana bianca – a half-term holiday in February traditionally spent skiing by the middle classes. In The Hand of God the Schisas have just acquired a small chalet in the fashionable Roccaraso resort, a couple of hours’ drive from Naples. It would have served as a welcome respite from the monotony of the working week, the smog and the chaos of a city in social and economic turmoil if it hadn’t been for the tragic accident: a gas leak, that took the lives of Fabietto’s (and Sorrentino’s) parents so abruptly. It was a fate that awaited Sorrentino too, had he not begged them to go to an away game in Empoli to watch Maradona play for his beloved Napoli football club. If “the hand of god” saved Sorrentino’s life, it also saved Naples. After Maradona’s unexpected arrival in 1984, he twice led the club to their first ever victories of the Italian league. In doing so, he united a socially fragmented city devastated by the 1980s earthquake, the rising power of the Camorra clans and a heroin epidemic. Maradona showed Neapolitans that they, too, could be exceptional. And so Sunday afternoons have ever since been defined by trips to the stadium in the westerly neighbourhood of Fuorigrotta, where Neapolitans from all corners of the city come to worship Maradona’s legacy. If the Neapolitans were searching for a miracle, in Maradona they found their saint. His icon, along with San Gennaro, is seen in shrines on every street corner of the historic centre, framed in flickering neon and fake flowers, ever expected to deliver the beleaguered city yet another miracle. Woven through the film are hints of Naples’ esoteric and occult impulses, exemplified by the significance of the film’s title and the opening scene where Fabietto’s aunt has a surreal encounter with benevolent figures from Neapolitan folklore. The blurring of paganism and Catholicism is nowhere better seen in Naples, however, than in the Cimitero delle Fontanelle, a former tufo stone quarry housing eight million bones, tucked away deep in La Sanità district. Here, for centuries, Neapolitans have gone to “adopt skulls”, dusting them off and leaving them offerings. They believe that by caring for the skulls, they free their souls from purgatory, sending them to heaven where they can finally return their earthly custodian a wish – commonly a husband. Still frequented today, the cemetery speaks to the city’s unique relationship with the sacred and the profane – a fascination of Sorrentino’s – where football stars can become saints, saints can save your life, and small hooded monks (seen at the beginning and end of the film) can make you fertile, rich and a successful film director. Sorrentino often says that Maradona’s skills were his first encounter with art before he discovered cinema. Yet it was cinema that finally led Sorrentino beyond the comfortable confines of his neighbourhood down to the lower city to the theatre in the city’s Quartieri Spagnoli, or to watch films being made in Galleria Toledo. Back up in Vomero, ambitious teenagers have long since piled into the legendary Acacia cinema to glimpse a world beyond their own and to dream of leaving the city for a more prosperous future. Sorrentino left too, for Rome, only returning to Naples last summer to finally make his paean. While filming, he stayed in an apartment by the sea on the Posillipo peninsula. His view looked out at the crumbling palazzos, the crystalline water, Vesuvius and those wide embracing arms. If it was the hand of god that saved his life, it was surely the bay of Naples, that most beautiful place on Earth, that brought him home.

12/13/2021,"Ever since childhood, I have wanted to be trained in the sword. But I have always believed one had to be born a musketeer for this to happen, or have a death to avenge, plus access to castle steps. But here I am at the London Fencing Club in Old Street, which is easier. It’s a few weeks before omicron takes off, and the government is pooh-poohing any talk of tightening Covid restrictions. I’m learning épée, the thin, pointy blade that most resembles a classic swashbuckling sword. My Russian-born coach, Anna Anstal, loves fencing épée. The opponent’s entire body is a target, and there are no “right of way” rules governing who can score at a given moment. “You must think about the zombie apocalypse,” she says. “Rules are no use with a zombie. The ability to strike first is all that matters.” It’s unexpected advice, her heavy accent giving it even more edge. I’m quite scared.  “Have you held a pistol before?” Anstal asks. I think we had different upbringings, I say. The “pistol grip” is the most common in fencing: blade gripped between thumb and forefinger, other fingers curled under, with surprising delicacy. The legs work far harder. We start with footwork drills, advancing up and down the 14-metre piste, front foot leading forwards, back foot for retreats. “Fast, fast!” shouts Anstal. It’s hard to keep my heels in line, so I quite literally veer off piste. I learn straight thrusts, lunges, an explosive flèche attack. I already feel like Arya Stark. We move to a padded pillar, to practise thrusts. I learn to gauge distance, never moving closer than I need to be. Fencing is about intelligence, Anstal explains. Something close to chess, or a conversation. “‘I’m going to hit your leg!’ ‘Not if I parry …’ ‘That was a joke – I’m actually hitting your mask!’” she illustrates. Her idea of a conversation is terrifying, but I’m picking up technique faster than I thought possible. I loved swordfighting as a boy, I reminisce. “All children do,” she confirms. “Then they come here, realise it’s all footwork drills, and say: ‘Mummy, I want to go home.’” Luckily, the school specialises in beginners’ courses for adults. The class around me is doing an intense warmup: shuttle runs, shuffle reps, squat running – anything that murders the legs. I’m sweating, too, having idiotically worn a polo neck for extra protection. “Listen – my favourite sound,” remarks Anstal with a far-off look. It’s the sound of exhaustion, a faint, fatigued wheezing that fills the room. Odd. There’s an alien appeal to fencing: those insectoid masks, stinging spines, the scrape and clash of metal. Yet with its elegant, all-white jackets and breeches, it’s also a sport of high tradition. Scores were originally tallied via soot on the blades, which marked the white clothes. (Although I suppose, even more originally, scores were settled by killing your opponent.) Now facing a mirror, sword pointed at my own chest, I learn parrying positions. Anstal divides my torso into numbered sections, like a butcher. Quarte, sixte, septième, octave – if I had known there was going to be so much French, I’d have dusted off my GCSE Tricolore textbook. Anstal masks up, and teaches me to disengage, ie feint around an opponent’s parry with a tiny circular motion. I’m not striking hard enough, she says. It’s hard enough to remember technicalities of arm line and footwork, and like most beginners, I lack killer instinct. “Everyone starts out very nice,” smiles Tim Gadaski, manager of the club. “Then they get hit a few times, and things change.” “I am in your country now, and I love democracy. So tell me what you want to do,” jokes Anstal, after an hour. Maybe practice more parries? She looks bored. “I think you should fight someone.” Huh? I’m not ready for that. But she is plugging a thin cable into my blade’s hand guard, threading it through an arm protector. At least I get to wear the natty white jacket. The class is setting up parallel pistes across the room. They face off with wires extending behind them, a marionette theatre of war. My opponent, confusingly also called Anna, salutes. My mask drops down. “En garde!” shouts Gadaski, stepping in to referee. Suddenly, I’m fencing for real. Anna and I test each other, nudging blades. “Too defensive. You’re not doing anything,” shouts Gadaski. Anna thrusts. I instinctively deflect, then again. I can defend myself! It’s thrilling. “You’re wasting your parries,” coaches Gadaski. “You need to counter.” I try, though technique has disappeared. The winner is the first to 10 points and Anna is leading 6-4. She’s attacking at will, but I’m scoring off her attacks, too, machines bleeping on both sides. Being hit doesn’t hurt, but I’m tiring fast. The entire room sounds like a video game. Anna overtakes me. 8-7! I hadn’t realised I was in the lead before. How? We both score. I steel myself, and concentrate. Maybe I’m Zatoichi, blind to my own abilities. I circle her blade, trying to stay on target. 9-9. We both lunge but I angle away, and have the reach. I’ve won! My inner child is jubilant. Fencing is a feeling like nothing else. Anna congratulates me, Anstal flashes a Slavic grin, acknowledging I have crushed my inner weakness. There must be something on those blades, because I feel the rush of adventure in my bloodstream, and leave on a swashbuckling high. I can legitimately declare myself trained in the sword. Zombies, you have been warned! Just let me consult my Tricolore first. To be stabbed with swords, and worked to exhaustion? Arya Stark raving mad? Maybe, as I definitely would.

12/13/2021,"“Drinks, nibbles, games”: three words delivered in a studiously measured tone that have added to serious stress headaches at the heart of government and sparked nagging rumours of the prime minister’s exit. The BBC’s Ros Atkins, who delivered the deadpan words in a video explainer of the “partygate” scandal that went viral, has become an unlikely star of the festive saga. Admirers from across the political divide – from Piers Morgan to James O’Brien – have praised his commitment to the cold, hard presentation of facts, while he has been credited with creating a “whole new genre of reporting”.  In a series of short explainers, the BBC News Channel’s Outside Source presenter has repeatedly skewered the Boris Johnson administration, while never coming within striking distance of seeming to have an opinion. “Forensic, measured, factual, brilliant,” wrote veteran broadcaster Andrew Neil after Atkins’ explainer on 6 December. Two days later Morgan tweeted: “Ros once again brilliantly illustrating that the best journalism is often the simplest: just damn people with cool, calm, collected & utterly irrefutable facts.” The first video on the Christmas parties was posted on 2 December, two days after the story broke, and two more have followed. In nine days the 3-4 minute clips – long for viral videos – have been watched over 11m times, far more than any other digital news series, with insiders in the BBC admitting that their popularity has confounded expectations about the desires of online news consumers. The 47-year-old is no hotshot newcomer. He has been at the BBC for 20 years, joining the corporation weeks after 9/11. He started out as a producer on Simon Mayo’s 5 live show, before becoming a presenter on the BBC World Service in 2004. Atkins, a former DJ who ran a club night in Brixton in the 2000s and performed at Womad, was part of the team that launched Outside Source, a daily show that curates news from wires, video feeds and social media on the News Channel and BBC World News, in 2014. His explainers started with coverage of the Australia bush fires in late 2019, and earlier this year the BBC launched Ros Atkins On, promising 10 minutes of his “straight-talking style of analysis and explanation” on the biggest issues of the day on iPlayer, BBC Breakfast and the BBC’s news website. His films, covering the heatwaves in the States and the Belarus migrant crisis as well as domestic political issues, “explain the background and context to current events in a scrupulously impartial, accessible way”, said Jamie Angus, senior controller, news output and commissioning, at BBC News. “He’s made this type of explainer his own, and it’s proved wildly popular with audiences across the world, and very shareable on social media,” he said. The explainers, very much seen as Atkins’ baby, were created in an attempt to make live TV also work as an on-demand digital product, with one former BBC news executive describing their style as “assertive impartiality”. “Ros is just brilliant at this,” the executive said. “If you look at what he’s done, it’s stripped down ‘this is what happened’ in three minutes flat – there’s no florid tedious language, there’s no self indulgence to it.” Atkins’ unflinching presentation manages to get the viewer to raise an eyebrow through facts alone, said the former executive. “I think sometimes the BBC mistakes impartiality for sucking the life out of something. But Ros is human and has a personality, while never making it about him, or leaving himself open to accusations of bias.” Colleagues say Atkins, who is married with two teenagers, is dedicated, rehearsing lines and tweaking scripts until he is sure they will have the greatest impact. One former colleague compared his approach to news to his love of squash. “He makes things look effortless but they’re not effortless. Just like being a very good squash player takes years of practice, being a really good TV craftsman takes a long time too – he works bloody hard to make it spot on.”",News/Media,Skewering No 10 over Christmas parties has made Ros Atkins a BBC star,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/dec/13/skewering-no-10-over-christmas-parties-has-made-ros-atkins-a-bbc-star
12/13/2021,"The Home Office is facing demands for an inquiry after it was claimed that pregnant refugees are not being fed or examined by doctors or midwives after arriving in the UK. A first-time mother who was 38 weeks pregnant was not seen by a doctor for several weeks after crossing the Channel, it is alleged. After the Iraqi Kurdish woman was examined, it emerged that she had a pathological fear of pregnancy, and the baby had a breech presentation.  Other allegations include that expectant mothers are being offered water instead of food and are not being given privacy from security guards while being examined. The claims come as the government plans to force councils to take unaccompanied children who have arrived in the UK via small boats. It is believed that more than 100 children are living in hotels because of a shortage of places in children’s homes. Last month 27 people, including three children and a pregnant woman, drowned when their boat sank off the coast of France, in the single biggest loss of life of the Channel crisis so far. Peter Kyle, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary and the MP for Hove and Portslade, has written to the Home Office asking it to investigate the treatment of at least five women at a hotel in his constituency. In a letter sent this month, he wrote: “A community midwife has been into the hotel as there was a pregnant woman who required booking for her antenatal care. When she arrived she discovered that the woman was already 38 weeks pregnant and had not been seen by a doctor/GP since arrival in the UK. This woman has primary tokophobia and has a possible breech presentation.” According to the letter, the midwife discovered there were another four women who required antenatal care. “She was required to attend to these women in a communal area and was unable to assess their other living conditions,” Kyle wrote. Another letter of complaint, written by a health official, said guards were allegedly withholding food. “Sometimes the pregnant women were only given water,” the official claimed. Three hotels in Hove have been taken over by the Home Office to house recent arrivals. A Refugee Council report in April on the use of hotels to accommodate people arriving by boats claimed that some people had been left unable to access even basic healthcare despite many having complex health needs. It found that they had received no assistance to register with a GP. Physical health needs had often been overlooked, such as people with mobility problems being placed on higher floors of hotels with no lifts. The Home Office said it worked “closely with service providers to ensure the highest possible standards in our accommodation and takes the welfare of women very seriously. All accommodation follows safety standards and Covid-19 regulations.” A Home Office spokesperson said they could not comment on individual cases. “Asylum seekers in our care have access to medical support if they need it. All asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute are provided with free, fully furnished accommodation and we also cover their utility costs. They are provided with a choice of three meals a day in line with NHS nutrition guidelines, as well as constant access to drinking water,” the spokesperson said.",News/UK news,Pregnant refugees not being seen by doctors for weeks after reaching UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/dec/13/pregnant-refugees-not-being-seen-by-doctors-for-weeks-after-reaching-uk
12/13/2021,"We’ve seen an increase in the number of people coming into my hospital trust over recent days. And we are sequencing them to check whether there’s Omicron there. It’s a slight increase, which you’d expect at this time of year. But we’re ready to activate well-established plans for a surge in Covid cases if that happens. For example, we’ve got a standing order of the wards we use for Covid cases and the services we close to deal with a Covid surge. But I think this winter will be worse – it will be harder – than last year. The challenge is bigger because we’re tackling the backlog of care, our A&E is incredibly busy, and also because of staffing problems. This isn’t just Covid, though Covid is a factor. And this isn’t just about people’s difficulties accessing primary care. It’s partly because people coming into hospital are much more severely ill than before.  Our stroke team say they’re seeing people coming in who haven’t been accessing some of the preventive interventions that might have stopped them getting so ill. And our gastro-intestinal specialists are seeing far more people with stage 3 or stage 4 cancers than previously. So there are things that haven’t been picked up. That has a consequential impact on hospitals because patients’ length of stay and recovery period are greater. The strain on hospitals is very visible and quite visceral – you can see ambulances queueing outside and people sleeping on chairs because you can’t get them into cubicles to be seen because too many sick people are waiting for beds. But what we can’t necessarily see is what’s happening to all the people who are at home getting sicker. That’s a very large, invisible problem. Many of the people in our hospital are very old and very frail. They don’t necessarily need to be in an acute hospital but they need to be in a bed somewhere, with someone looking after them round the clock. Social care is a massive, massive concern; not being able to get these people who are medically fit to be discharged out and home is what blocks up the “front door”, our A&E. We’re going great guns at treating people on the waiting list. And this winter we’re doing more than ever to protect that, as well as dealing with all the other pressures we have. We are holding beds for people on the waiting list who are having surgery. But that raises really difficult ethical dilemmas. Do you hold an intensive care bed for someone with an aneurysm that could kill them at any minute, or bring in someone who’s just arrived through A&E and needs surgery? Is there a bed for someone who comes in and needs a thrombectomy, a potentially life-saving operation after a stroke? You can imagine how some of our staff feel about unvaccinated people with Covid eating into our supply of ICU beds when you’re making these decisions, about whether someone with stage 4 cancer or an aneurysm can have an operation. Workforce is a real problem. We’re struggling to get enough healthcare assistants. We’ve lost 25% of our stroke care pathway because it’s lost its community rehabilitation capacity that we just can’t staff. And several very experienced consultants have said “I’m going to give you one more winter and then I’m off. I’ve realised through the pandemic that when I’m on my deathbed I’ll remember the time I spent with my family and not the Saturday nights I spent doing an extra shift.” Our staff are resolute and they’re still delivering absolutely fantastic care. But after the last 20 months they’re pretty weary. It’s mile 23 of a marathon, really – that’s what it feels like – but the problem is that the finish line keeps getting a bit further away. Staff are pretty worn out. And they’re quite frightened about being redeployed into Covid wards again. The first time it was “once more unto the breach”. But now, when it’s like fifth time unto the breach, people are sick of the bloody breach. They don’t want to go there again. A lot of staff are saying “I’m not going back into Covid wards”. So that’s going to be tough. Staff will keep going and keep giving, because that’s their values. But I worry about the public starting to lose confidence in us and losing faith in us because of their experience of this as well. It’s a tough and frustrating situation. And there are no quick answers.

12/13/2021,"Boris Johnson faces the biggest rebellion of his premiership on Tuesday over new Covid restrictions amid warnings he has galvanised previously loyal MPs against him. Critics have warned that up to 100 MPs could oppose plan B changes across a series of Commons votes, forcing the government to rely heavily on Labour for them to pass.  Dozens of backbenchers – and some junior ministerial aides – have expressed opposition to requiring people attending large events to prove their vaccine status or a recent negative test result. Some are poised to rebel or abstain despite never having voted against restrictions before. Relations between No 10 and many Conservative MPs have soured in the wake of scandals over Owen Paterson, undeclared donations to fund the Downing Street flat refurbishment and parties that appeared to contravene Covid rules last Christmas. While a backlash by some cabinet ministers led to the plans for vaccine passports being watered down so that proof of a negative test result would be allowed, too, that has not done enough to assuage concerns voiced by Steve Baker, deputy chair of the Covid Recovery Group, that the UK is drifting towards authoritarianism. The documents will be required for indoor venues of more than 500 people or outdoor settings of 10,000 people. Keir Starmer confirmed on Sunday that Labour would support all plan B measures. However several backbenchers who have never voted against Covid measures told the Guardian they would probably do so. One said the prime minister’s behaviour after recent scandals had “galvanised more of us to no longer blindly follow the orders cooked up by whips”. A frontbencher also said: “If they go overboard with the whipping on this, it’s going to hasten Boris’ departure – and it’s already been hastened quite a lot.” Simon Fell, a member of the 2019 intake who has not voted against Covid restrictions before, said while he had “no doubt about just how serious this new variant could be”, he would not support Covid passports. He said: “We are not a ‘papers please’ society, and such passports would be an unethical and discriminatory step. I will not be supporting their introduction.” Tom Randall and Alicia Kearns, both new Tory MPs and members of the 1922 Committee executive, are set to stage their first rebellion over Covid restrictions. Randall said “the case for certification had not been made”. And Kearns said Covid passports were “being proposed before we receive a detailed assessment of the severity of the Omicron variant”, adding: “I cannot justify introduction of Covid-19 passports just in case and without the data, and given that evidence from other countries is that vaccine passports don’t work.” Among those sceptical of the Covid passports plan are about six parliamentary private secretaries (PPSs) – MPs who act as aides to ministers and are expected to vote in line with the government. Jacob Young, a PPS to Michael Gove, is believed to be among them. In a bid to curb the number who would be forced to resign if they abstain or vote against the measure, Sajid Javid, the health secretary, had a meeting with some PPSs on Saturday. William Wragg, who sits on the executive of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs and heckled Javid in the Commons chamber last week, urging him to resign, said he felt “immense frustration that the government should be pursuing this policy, which on previous occasions they tried to reassure us that they wouldn’t be doing”. Wragg said plan B was “jumping the gun” and “going too fast”, taking aim at any attempt to “coerce” people to get vaccinated by introducing Covid passports. A frustrated minister predicted a “big rebellion” and said Johnson would probably be “wounded” by it for having to rely on Labour votes to pass such an important motion. The minister told the Guardian that many Tories would not vote for Covid passports because Labour’s backing meant there was no chance the government would be defeated, but hit out at the “righteous indignity” of some colleagues. The minister added Johnson still seemed “clueless” on how to tackle Covid through the winter and there was a “genuine level of uncertainty” about whether more restrictions would follow, but insisted: “A proportionate, precautionary response is not unreasonable. This doesn’t pass the test of people’s liberty being fatally withdrawn.” The previous biggest vote where Conservative MPs voted against the government was over changes to the tier system in December 2020, with 55 opposing the measures and 16 abstaining. Other rebellions have included more than 60 Tories opposing the 10pm curfew for hospitality venues enforced last autumn and pushing back the final stage of the reopening roadmap in June 2021. Nikki da Costa, a former senior adviser in No 10, noted: “Whips’ rule of thumb is rebellion breeds rebellion – it’s easier ‘next time’.” Nadhim Zahawi, the education secretary, tried to reassure people the Covid passports would only be temporary, as they have a sunset clause and will be reviewed on 5 January. He said it was only for “high risk events” that either a lateral flow test or vaccine status certificate would be required. “That is, I think, proportionate as we see where we hopefully arrive at with the booster, because the boosters are to protect the most vulnerable,” Zahawi told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson may face biggest rebellion so far over new Covid rules,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/13/boris-johnson-may-face-biggest-rebellion-so-far-over-new-covid-rules
