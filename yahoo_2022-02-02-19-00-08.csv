2/2/2022,"The remains of a Texas man who vanished during a lunch break from work in early December has been inside the trunk of his car at an impound lot. The Houston Police Department announced Monday that they have identified remains found on Jan. 19 in the trunk of the car — discovered in an impound lot hundreds of miles away in Dallas — as Taylour Young, 25. It appears as though Young had been dead for some time. “Young's body was in an advanced state of decomposition,” police stated. They noted that the investigation remains ongoing and the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Officer will determine Young's cause of death. Young vanished in Houston on Dec. 9 during a lunch break from work, local news station KTRK reported. He was last spotted driving his 2019 silver Honda Civic near a Capital One Bank in Houston. Tiffany Robinson, Young's mother, told People last month that she and Young’s girlfriend tracked his phone using Find My Phone after they lost contact with him. Robinson said they found her son's phone in some bushes near the bank, adding that she doesn't know what he was doing there. Young worked in accounting after graduating from Sam Houston State University, where he was well “loved,” his mom told People last month. “I've had his coworkers tell me funny stories,” she said. “I didn't know Taylour would go to Whole Foods and play bingo with senior citizens, but a colleague of his told me that. I thought that was so funny and just the perfect example of the nice boy he is."" The last text between mother and son was a photo of his beloved dog Gigi. ""As I shared Taylour's disappearance with the world, I want to share my worldly loss as well. I lost my son, my baby, my friend; and will raise his love, his dog Gigi,"" Robinson wrote on Instagram as she announced his death. She said she will not be answering questions as the family mourns and police continue their investigation. “I am proud of the man he matured into,” she wrote of her late son. Anyone with information about Young's death is urged to call the Houston Police Department Homicide Division at 713-308-3600.",U.S./Oxygen,"Man Who Vanished During Lunch Break Found In The Trunk Of His Car, Hundreds Of Miles From Where He Lived",https://news.yahoo.com/man-vanished-during-lunch-break-195439667.html

On Tuesday, former President Donald Trump’s eldest son appeared to suggest there was something more nefarious about Maddow’s break from hosting duties when, in reality, she will spend the time working on a Ben Stiller-directed movie of her book, “Bag Man,” about the political scandal surrounding Richard Nixon’s Vice President Spiro Agnew. “Seems the TRUTH finally broke her!” declared the Trump scion: Seems the TRUTH finally broke her!
