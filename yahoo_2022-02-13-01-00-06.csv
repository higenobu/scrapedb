2/13/2022,"Sheriff Alex Villanueva was stripped of the responsibility to enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Los Angeles lawmakers voted to remove this power after he refused to enforce the mandate. The mandate requires that all 110,000 Los Angeles County employees be vaccinated by October 1. Lawmakers in Los Angeles earlier this week voted to strip a sheriff who refused to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for his staff of his enforcement power. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors decided on Tuesday to relieve Sheriff Alex Villanueva of the responsibility to enforce COVID-19 vaccine mandates, The Los Angeles Times reported. The decision to strip him of the responsibility comes after Villanueva has for months refused to enforce the mandate. In October, Villanueva said he would not enforce the mandate because he feared losing a chunk of his staff. ""No, I am not forcing anyone, the issue has become so politicized there are entire groups of employees that are willing to be fired and laid off rather than get vaccinated,"" he said in a Facebook Live stream. ""I don't want to be in a position to lose 5 to 10% of my workforce overnight on a vaccine mandate,"" Villanueva added. In August, the chair of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors issued an executive order that required all of the 110,000 people employed by Los Angeles County to be vaccinated by October 1. ""Unfortunately, the Sheriff's Department is the only department in the county that's refused to implement this policy,"" board supervisor Janice Hahn said of the decision to strip Villanueva of his power, The Times reported. ""I think we were left with no other choice."" The decision will allow the county to place enforcement responsibilities in the hands of someone who complies with and believes in the mandate, The Times reported. However, county employees who are not yet vaccinated will have a chance to get inoculated before potentially facing termination, The Times said. Villanueva characterized the decision as a way to remove thousands of unvaccinated people from his department. ""This is nothing more than another politically motivated stunt by the Board, which has no bearing on public health, but will definitely harm public safety,"" Villanueva said in a Tuesday statement. As of Tuesday, 83% of all county employees were fully vaccinated against the coronavirus, a county spokesperson told the Times.

 The first Black federal judge in Alabama spoke out against one of President Biden's potential Supreme Court picks in a letter addressed to the commander in chief that was obtained by NBC News. U.W. Clemon, a former chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama, urged the president not to consider Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for the vacancy. The retired judge said that there are ""several exceptionally well-qualified black female aspirants for the Supreme Court"" but that he ""strongly believe[s]"" Jackson should not be considered. Clemon referenced case Ross v. Lockhead as reasoning for his opposition to Jackson, a class-action suit she presided over on behalf of 5,500 Black Lockheed Martin employees. Clemon wrote that Jackson refused to approve the settlement that was reached which would have provided $22 million to the workers. ""She refused to approve the settlement because in her view there were no common factual questions,"" Clemon wrote. The White House defended Jackson following Clemon's letter in a statement to NBC News. ""It's because of Judge Jackson's experience in roles at all levels of the justice system, her character, and her legal brilliance that President Biden nominated her to the D.C. Circuit Court, after which she earned her third Senate confirmation, and he's very proud of that decision,"" deputy press secretary Andrew Bates said in the statement. Biden said last week that he has narrowed his search down to four nominees to replace the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer, adding he plans to announce his pick by the end of February. When Biden campaigned for the presidency in 2020, he vowed to nominate a Black woman to the Supreme Court should there be an opening. Senate Democrats are anxious for Biden to make his pick so that they can begin the confirmation process and avoid any potential moves by the GOP to slow it down.",Politics/The Hill,First Black federal judge in Alabama asks Biden not to nominate Ketanji Brown Jackson to Supreme Court,https://news.yahoo.com/first-black-federal-judge-alabama-144415599.html
