2/8/2022,"Scott Morrison was sorry for a longstanding toxic culture, “generations of culture, in this place and in the building before it, of bullying and harassment”. The prime minister was sorry that the place Brittany Higgins worked in, the people’s house, “turned out to be a nightmare”.  The sorrow was expressed in Tuesday’s statement of acknowledgment – a succession of well-crafted speeches from the presiding officers and the political leadership acknowledging that a powerful institution, the parliament of Australia, had failed its workforce far too often. The prime minister was sorry for the toxic culture. Sorry for the danger that lurked unchecked in the supposedly safe place. Sorry for the hazardous by-products of occupational aggression. And Morrison was “sorry for far more than that”. This “more” sounded intriguing. Would Morrison be sorry for treating Higgins like a political crisis to be managed? Would the prime minister be sorry for launching a coded attack on the journalist who first reported Higgins’ allegation during a press conference last year that was supposed to be a mea culpa over his government’s handling of complaints from women? Would he be sorry for having his wife clarify things that should have been clear to him? Would the prime minister be sorry for failing a significant test of leadership over the preceding 12 months? Would Australia’s prime minister be humble enough to read into Hansard precisely how he had failed, and would he be candid enough to share what he had learned? Sorrow, after all, is one thing. Self knowledge is quite another. Morrison doesn’t apologise very often, so Tuesday’s apology was, of course, significant. The parliament apologised on Tuesday because apologising was recommendation one of the Jenkins review: acknowledge the unacceptable history of workplace bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault in commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. “We are sorry,” the prime minister told the chamber. To remove any ambiguity, the prime minister said: “I am sorry. I am sorry to Ms Higgins for the terrible things that took place here”. No more “Brittany”. Ms Higgins. One lesson learned, perhaps. A woman who has been to hell and back in going public with her allegations has earned the dignity of formality. A woman capable of shaming the most powerful institution in the country is an equal – not a daughter or a subordinate. One enduring lesson, perhaps. Ms Higgins was watching on from above, a visitor in the visitors gallery of her former workplace. The former Liberal staffer, who was the primary catalyst for the ritualised act of repentance playing out below, had been invited to attend the event at the last minute, because while everyone is sorry, some basic blockages seem impossible to clear. The first time Higgins saw the official statement of acknowledgment was on Tuesday afternoon when the independent MP Zali Steggall printed off a copy from the computer in her office. Clarity that she and a handful of others had been invited to attend the formalities in person only arrived on Monday night at 10.21pm. Participants in the process felt themselves shunted on a travelator. The moment was being rushed to an arbitrary point in time and space. The government wanted the statement of acknowledgment to be delivered before Higgins and the 2021 Australian of the Year, Grace Tame, addressed the National Press Club on Wednesday. First mover advantage. Inclusion was the casualty of the deadline. Higgins sat rigid and masked in the visitors gallery on Tuesday with other women who have raised their voices to change the toxic Downton Abbey culture of political staffing – including former aides Chelsey Potter, Rachelle Miller and Josie Coles. Some others weren’t invited at all. Some women watching remotely raged and wept. The collective sorrow – the fine words – didn’t magically erase the bullying, belittling and worse. And yet there was the sound of a line being drawn. Parliament, institutionally, with multiparty unity, might be turning a page. But the staff who have endured trauma still live with their trauma, with their lack of resolution, with the measurable gap between what they wanted to happen, and what happened. They also live with the knowledge of what it cost them to drag the prime minister and the parliament to Tuesday’s moment of collective recognition – just how deeply they needed to dig. Higgins stuck it out resolutely in her seat for most of Tuesday’s acknowledgments. But as the repentance rolled on, she wept, and left the chamber when it became too much. Because most of the last 12 months, let’s be really honest, has been too much. So what were the limits of a prime ministerial mea culpa? The prime minister, on Tuesday, was sorry, for Ms Higgins, and for her antecedents, “for all of those who came before Ms Higgins and endured the same”. Morrison also told the chamber that sorry was only the start of this collective reckoning. “That is our promise to those who are here today and those watching across Australia”. “For those of us who are here now, we know we have that opportunity, and we must, and we can, and we will do better”. Words are fine. Actions are better. This isn’t over. Australians will be watching what you have learned. What you are prepared to change.",News/Australia news,"Scott Morrison says he is sorry, but what has he learned? | Katharine Murphy",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/scott-morrison-says-he-is-sorry-but-what-has-he-learned
2/8/2022,"Most people have probably heard of Chernobyl, or the BP oil spill. You may also know about my legal battle over contaminated water in California, dramatized in the movie Erin Brockovich. Yet far fewer people have heard about what transpired in the Ecuadorian Amazon – though it’s considered by some activists, journalists, and members of US Congress to be one of the world’s worst environmental disasters. What if I told you that a multinational oil company allegedly polluted the Amazon for almost three decades? And that the oil company has spent even more years refusing to accept liability? Or that a US attorney who agreed to represent thousands of Ecuadorian villagers in a lawsuit against that oil company has lost his law license, income, spent hundreds of days under house arrest in New York, and in 2021 was sentenced to six months in prison?  From 1964 to 1990, Texaco, which merged with Chevron in 2001, allegedly spilled more than 16m gallons of crude oil – “80 times more oil than was spilled in BP’s 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster”, according to Gizmodo – and 18bn gallons of polluted wastewater in the Amazon rainforest. The pollution allegedly contaminated the ground and waterways with toxic chemicals that the plaintiffs – mostly Indigenous people and poor farmers – say has caused cancer, miscarriages, skin conditions and birth defects. (Chevron has said that Texaco’s operations were “completely in line with the standards of the day” and told the New Yorker, in 2012, that “there is no corroborating evidence” for the health allegations.) In 1993, Steven Donziger, a recent Harvard law school graduate and human rights attorney, began working on an environmental case on behalf of Ecuadorians allegedly affected by Texaco’s drilling. The case eventually became a 30,000-person class action lawsuit against Texaco in New York federal court. Texaco/Chevron did not dispute that pollution occurred, and “freely admits that large sludge pits still dot the Amazon”, the New Yorker reported. The company argued that the Ecuadorian government released it from liability after paying for an earlier cleanup, and that Ecuador’s state oil company, Petroecuador, was responsible for the remaining damage. The plaintiffs argued that the earlier cleanup was woefully insufficient; that Texaco, not Petroecuador, directed actual operations in the area; and that Chevron’s earlier agreement with the government of Ecuador did not bar lawsuits by individuals. (The government of Ecuador also disagrees with Chevron’s claims.) A jury trial in the US might have put Texaco under an embarrassing and costly spotlight, so, perhaps for that reason, the company lobbied to move the legal proceedings back to Ecuador, which has no jury trials and is heavily dependent on the oil industry. Texaco argued that Ecuador had a fair and competent legal system. A US judge agreed to relocate the case on the condition that Texaco accept the verdict of the Ecuadorian system. Texaco’s maneuver backfired: In 2011, Donziger and the plaintiffs won the case there. An Ecuadorian court ruled that Texaco, which had been bought by Chevron at this point, was “responsible for vast contamination”, according to the New Yorker, and “ordered it to pay $18bn in damages – the largest judgment ever awarded in an environmental lawsuit”. Both parties appealed the decision: Chevron said it was “illegitimate and unenforceable” and accused the plaintiffs of having ghostwritten an expert environmental opinion; the plaintiffs denied that the opinion was fraudulent and said that, if anything, the monetary judgment was too low given the scale of pollution. Chevron’s accusation that the judgment was illegitimate relied heavily on testimony by an Ecuadorian judge, Alberto Guerra, whom Chevron relocated to the US and, as of 2015, paid a $12,000 monthly salary. Guerra testified that the plaintiffs had bribed him to sway the Ecuadorian judgment against Chevron. Guerra later recanted much of his claim – admitting, Vice News reported in 2015, that “there is no evidence to corroborate allegations of a bribe or a ghostwritten judgment, and that large parts of his sworn testimony … were exaggerated and, in other cases, simply not true”. (Chevron disputes the significance of Guerra’s change in testimony, telling Vice News, in 2015, that trial “transcripts make clear that Chevron proved its case before the international arbitration tribunal”.) Part of the Ecuadorian judgment against Chevron was a fine for not apologizing for the pollution; in 2013, Ecuador’s national court of justice determined that “there had been no legal basis to sanction Chevron for not apologizing,” according to Reuters, and reduced the judgment to $9.5bn, but otherwise affirmed the original decision. Instead of accepting the legal outcome and the responsibilities that come when you acquire a company (see Dupont-now-Chemours or Monsanto-now-Bayer), Chevron “made clear that it would not be paying the judgment”, according to the Intercept, and “moved its assets out of the country”. The company went from claiming Ecuador’s legal system was fair to claiming it was too corrupt to trust. “We’re going to fight this until hell freezes over, and then we’ll fight it on the ice,” a Chevron attorney vowed – “a remark that became a watchword at the company”, according to the Wall Street Journal. Chevron has more than made good on that promise. It has pursued a years-long campaign against the plaintiffs, their lawyers, and even the entire country of Ecuador. Chevron’s legal strategy is masterminded by Gibson Dunn, a notoriously aggressive corporate law firm that the Montana supreme court rebuked in 2007, in a different case, for “legal thuggery” and “actual malice”. Randy Mastro, a former federal prosecutor and aide to New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, leads the firm’s Chevron file. A “merciless litigator”, according to the New Yorker, Mastro was once described as “the only person in the Giuliani administration who made the mayor seem like a nice guy”. Here’s the thing: a massive multinational corporation such as Chevron can afford to pay millions of dollars in legal fees, indefinitely – and doing so will almost always be cheaper than paying a fine or settling. Chevron “insists that delay is not its object”, Vanity Fair reported in 2007, but the plaintiffs and their attorneys “are persuaded that it is.” “Take $6bn as a figure,” Donziger explained to Vanity Fair’s William Langewiesche. “Simply by sticking the money into a savings account Chevron could make $300m for every year it doesn’t pay. That sum multiplied by the four years of the trial so far would amount to $1.2bn, which is far more than, say, $50m spent on legal fees, even if Chevron now loses the case. And what if Chevron wins – what would the calculation be then?” Corporations can also sue plaintiffs back – crushing any opposition under, to use Chevron’s words, “an avalanche of paper”. This is part of a disturbing legal playbook sometimes known as Slapp – strategic lawsuit against public participation. Massive corporations can fund endless litigation against activists or critics. They don’t even need to win in court, because they can intimidate or bankrupt their opponents in legal fees. (Chevron disputes that it engages in Slapp tactics, though an anti-Slapp organization twice named Chevron “corporate bully of the year” and in 2021 bestowed a “lifetime achievement award” on the company.) After Chevron “successfully defeated a lawsuit seeking to hold it responsible for the shooting deaths of protesters on an offshore oil platform in Nigeria”, it even tried, unsuccessfully, “to compel the impoverished Nigerian plaintiffs, some of whom were widows or children, to reimburse its attorneys’ fees”, the New Yorker reported in 2012. “That’s how they litigate,” Bert Voorhees, an attorney who represented the Nigerian plaintiffs, told the New Yorker’s Patrick Radden Keefe. “The point is to scare off the next community that might try to assert its human rights.” In 2018, an international tribunal ruled that Chevron had been previously released from liability for pollution in the Amazon and ordered Ecuador not to enforce the $9.5bn judgment. Ecuador continues to maintain that the judgment is legitimate. In retaliation, “the giant US oil company objected last June when Washington proposed allowing duty-free rose imports from the world’s poorest countries, including Ecuador”, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021. “Letting Ecuador save money on flowers after blatant ‘acts of defiance’ would tell the world the US rewards bad behavior, the oil company said.” Chevron has also asked the international tribunal to order that “nearly $800m of Chevron’s legal costs [be] paid by Ecuador, a country whose gross domestic product is about half of Chevron’s stock-market value”. Then there’s Donziger. PR advisers for Chevron promised to “demonize” Donziger in the public eye. The oil company “hired private investigators to track Donziger, created a publication” which smeared him, and “put together a legal team of hundreds of lawyers from 60 firms, who have successfully pursued an extraordinary campaign against him”, the Intercept reported in 2020. Donziger has spent years of his life fighting seemingly endless litigation. In 2011, Chevron sued Donziger and members of the lawsuit in a US court for $60m in damages, accusing them of extortion and invoking a sweeping and controversial statute originally created to fight the Mafia. Chevron’s case rested in large part on Guerra’s since-recanted corruption claims; Donziger and his codefendants denied the charges. “The approach of accusing victims’ attorneys of being fraudsters has been honed with particular energy by [the] law firm Gibson Dunn,” Bloomberg noted in 2014. Shortly before the suit went to trial, Chevron dropped the demand for monetary damages, thus denying Donziger the right to a jury trial. During the suit, which Chevron won, the company demanded that Donziger turn over his phone and computer to their legal team. After Donziger refused, arguing that doing so would violate attorney-client privilege, the judge in the case charged him with criminal contempt of court. The US attorney’s office declined to prosecute Donziger for contempt, so the judge in the case made the extraordinary move of appointing a private law firm to represent the government in prosecuting Donziger – a development that two US senators have called “highly unusual” and “concerning”. The senators also noted that the firm appointed to prosecute Donziger previously represented Chevron. Because he was deemed a “flight risk”, Donziger spent more than 800 days under house detention, with an electronic ankle bracelet, while awaiting the outcome of the trial. In 2020, according to the Intercept’s Sharon Lerner, Donziger’s “bank accounts have been frozen. He now has a lien on his apartment, faces exorbitant fines, and has been prohibited from earning money. As of August [2019], a court has seized his passport and put him on house arrest. Chevron, which has a market capitalization of $228bn, has the funds to continue targeting Donziger for as long as it chooses.” Donziger eventually lost the contempt case, which he called a “charade”. As a consequence of the charges against him, he also lost his law license – against the recommendation of the judicial officer who refereed the professional conduct hearing. The officer, a former federal prosecutor, described Donziger as a stubborn gadfly who is “often his own worst enemy” but called the move to disbar him unjustified, and decried the “extent of his pursuit by Chevron” as “extravagant, unnecessary and punitive.” In October, Donziger reported to a federal prison to begin a six-month contempt sentence. (In December he was returned to home detention as part of a Covid-related early-release program.) He still cannot make a living as a lawyer, cannot collect any legal fees from the Ecuador judgment, and had to wear an electronic ankle bracelet until last weekend. In November, nine members of US Congress signed a letter calling Donziger’s treatment “unprecedented and unjust imprisonment”. International judicial monitors, lawyers’ associations, members of European parliament, and Amnesty International have also criticized the charges against Donziger as excessive and punitive, and 29 Nobel laureates from around the world signed an open letter arguing that Donziger is a victim of “judicial harassment”. I’ve dealt with similar cases myself, with different companies. In 1993, I was part of a team that filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 650 plaintiffs against PG&E, alleging that the California utility company knew that harmful chemicals, particularly hexavalent chromium, were seeping into groundwater in Hinkley, California, and contaminating the town’s water supply. That case ultimately resulted in the largest medical settlement lawsuit in history at that time and changed my life. After Hinkley, we discovered other towns nearby in California where hexavalent chromium was causing health problems and wreaking havoc on lives. In 2006, PG&E agreed to pay another $295m to settle a series of lawsuits over contaminated water affecting another 1,100 people. Imagine if instead of a movie telling my story, I’d gone to jail. That’s essentially what has happened to Steve Donziger. And, since this litigation started in 1993, Chevron has not paid a cent or performed any cleanup. So far the only people who have paid for Chevron’s alleged behavior are Donziger and those affected by the contamination – the poor and indigenous Ecuadorians who continue to live every day with the pollution’s effects.

2/8/2022,"The UK government’s decision to allow homes to be built to low standards of energy efficiency cost owners of newly built homes about £234m last year, analysis shows. The zero carbon homes standard was supposed to come into force in 2016, but the measure, which was introduced under Labour, was scrapped by the Conservative government in 2015.  Since 2016, almost 1.2m new homes have been built with energy efficiency standards that are well below those needed in the long term to reach the net zero greenhouse gas emissions target. The Liberal Democrats have calculated that as each home under the zero carbon standard could have expected an energy bill saving of £200 a year, the cumulative cost to households living in newly built homes has been about £790m since 2016. The research follows separate findings from Labour last year that suggested owners of newly built homes would face bills of £20,000 to upgrade them to zero carbon standards, a cost of about £20bn for the whole of the UK. If housebuilders had been forced to meet the zero carbon homes standard, the cost would have been about £5bn, and borne by the lucrative homebuilding industry. The technology needed to build zero carbon homes is already widely available, and in widespread use in other countries. It comprises heat pumps, solar panels, high-grade materials such as thermal glazing, and high-standard insulation. But these technologies are not widely used in the UK for building new homes, as they are more costly than the current building regulations require. Homebuilders have been reluctant to build to such requirements, because although it would mean large savings over many years to the owners of the dwellings, using the necessary materials and techniques would add to their construction costs. Wera Hobhouse, the energy and climate change spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said: “The Conservatives have slapped hundreds of pounds on to people’s heating bills by scrapping energy efficiency standards for new homes. This shameful record has left over 1.2 million more people living in poorly insulated homes, making them even more vulnerable to soaring energy prices. “It shows the Conservatives are more interested in cosying up to their property developer friends than slashing people’s bills and tackling the climate crisis.” Green campaigners and analysts fear the government is planning further cuts to the UK’s spending on insulation and other energy efficiency measures. The Energy Company Obligation, which adds about £1bn a year to energy bills to pay for insulation and energy efficiency measures for the poorest households, is under threat from the Treasury, although it has saved an estimated £11.7bn on bills for people on low incomes. Hobhouse added: “The fact ministers are now considering cutting even more energy efficiency measures shows that they still haven’t learned any lessons from this failure. The government needs to urgently bring back energy efficiency standards for new builds and insulate older homes, so people aren’t condemned to years of eye-watering energy bills.” A government spokesperson said: “Record global gas prices only underscore the importance of our plan to generate more clean power in this country so we can reduce our reliance on expensive, volatile fossil fuels. As such, we have no plans to move away from our green ambitions, and we remain committed to supporting our homegrown renewables sector, investing over £6.6bn to decarbonise homes and buildings across England, and extending the Energy Company Obligation from 2022 to 2026, boosting its value to £1bn a year.” The Conservatives have received an estimated £18m from property developers since Boris Johnson became prime minister.",News/Environment,Low energy efficiency standards cost owners of new homes £234m last year,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/08/low-energy-efficiency-standards-cost-owners-of-new-homes-234m-last-year
2/8/2022,"Peers are attempting to block plans which could prevent women who are fleeing rape, forced marriage, trafficking or female genital mutilation from securing refugee status – a move that critics say was sneaked into the nationality and borders bill. The Labour peer Lady Lister, with support from the crossbencher Lady Coussins, the Liberal Democrat Lord Paddick and the bishop of Gloucester, have tabled an amendment to the bill due to be discussed on Tuesday.  If passed it will reverse a clause added to the controversial bill after the consultation period had ended. Peers say the belatedly added clause will seriously damage the ability of survivors of gender-based persecution to be recognised as refugees and granted protection, a change that will disproportionately affect women and girls. Lawyers say the clause, if approved, will change how the 1951 UN refugee convention is interpreted. Clause 32 of the convention refers to membership of a “particular social group” and is a key ground to qualify as a refugee. It is used by women and girls fleeing gender-based persecution. The current definition of “particular social group” in domestic law contains two conditions, either of which can be satisfied to demonstrate someone is in need of refugee protection. However, the new clause reverses this legal principle and substitutes it with what lawyers from the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA) say is an erroneous definition from European law which states that both conditions must be satisfied before refugee status can be granted. The introduction of this technicality would present a significant additional hurdle to women accessing refugee protection in the UK, meaning that some of the most vulnerable people seeking protection could no longer get it. Lister, who tabled the amendment to reverse the change, said: “Clause 32 is one example of how the bill will seriously damage women fleeing gender-based violence and abuse, by creating a significant barrier to refugee protection, as the UNHCR [United Nations high commissioner for refugees] has warned. It is crucial that the Lords overturn this change.” Alphonsine Kabagabo, the director of the charity Women for Refugee Women, said: “The government’s nationality and borders bill is the biggest threat to women being able to access refugee protection in the UK that we have ever seen. The bill is dangerous and discriminatory.” Zoe Bantleman, the legal director at the ILPA, said: “The bill introduces a regressive definition of ‘particular social group’ for the purposes of the 1951 refugee convention that reverses case law of senior UK courts, contravenes UNHCR standards, and reinstates an erroneous EU law standard, which will disproportionately affect women and girls fleeing gender-based persecution.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “The UK has a proud history of providing protection to the most vulnerable people in genuine need, including women, and this will not change. The changes we are making are to ensure we have a more consistent approach to assessing asylum claims and it is wrong to claim female asylum seekers will be excluded from being considered as a member of a particular group. The nationality and borders bill will deliver the government’s new plan for immigration – the most comprehensive reform in decades – to fix the broken asylum system.”",News/UK news,Peers oppose plan that may stop women fleeing rape gaining refugee status,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/peers-oppose-plan-that-may-stop-women-fleeing-gaining-refugee-status
2/8/2022,"Young children’s counting books can (whisper it) be a bit dull. They’re brilliant, of course, at helping under-fives learn their numbers. But turning page after page of, say, farmyard animals gradually multiplying can get rather formulaic. How to Count to One (and Don’t Even Think About Bigger Numbers) (Nosy Crow, 17 March) aims to mix things up: here, Caspar Salmon teasingly forbids his readers to count beyond one. Matt Hunt’s primary-coloured drawings teem with multiple lifeforms – ducks, whales, worms – but you must spot the one duck that’s rollerblading, or the one worm in disguise. It’s a neat bit of reverse psychology – little kids will itch to break the rules; they’ll revel in chatting back to the bossy narrator (who sometimes slips up: “I made a mistake! And now you have said ‘two!’” he cries). Like French author Hervé Tullet’s interactive bestsellers such as Press Here! and Say Zoop!, this debut is more than a book; it’s an invitation to have fun – a playful provocation.  Monster! Hungry! Phone! by Sean Taylor and illustrator Fred Benaglia (Bloomsbury), is another high-energy read. If the title alone doesn’t wake you up, wait until the monster starts shouting his pizza order down the phone. A red, egg-shaped beast with a beakish nose and inky scribbled hairdo, he’s starving, but keeps misdialling and reaching a sleepy sloth or a jaguar in Nicaragua. Finally, with the pizza almost within his grasp, he accidentally scares the delivery guy away and is forced to gobble the only thing to hand … When a colourful glass marble drops into the grey, intricately sketched world of the insects in It Fell From the Sky (Frances Lincoln), they all agree it’s the most amazing thing they’ve ever seen. They study the mysterious new addition – roll it, lick it, try to hatch it. Soon, though, a greedy spider decides that it belongs to him, and turns it into a museum attraction with a hefty entrance fee. Until disaster strikes. The latest from Canadian-based creatives the Fan Brothers is a thought-provoking exploration of selfishness, which also encourages children to look deeply. Young imaginations should be enchanted by the idea that stuff lost from their pockets becomes treasure for bugs. Gill Smith’s illustrations for Saving the Butterfly (Walker) by Helen Cooper also lean towards muted grey shades as we see a boy and his older sister, two refugees, rescued from a boat. The boy settles, makes friends, but the girl is haunted by the past and can’t move on until the day her brother brings her a butterfly. As the insect and the girl begin to flourish, the illustrations become as rich and colourful as the butterfly’s wings. A tender tale focusing on the aftermath of conflict, it’s a great companion to Nicola Davies’s memorable The Day War Came (2019). The notion that a story or film can take you on a journey is overused these days, but it’s the perfect description for I Am the Subway (Scribe), a stunning new Korean picture book by Kim Hyo-eun (and translator Deborah Smith) that evokes the physical experience of riding on an underground train, and the random lives the subway throws together each day. Punctuated throughout by the sound of the train on the tracks – ba-dum, ba-dum – the book shows us Seoul through the eyes of a subway train moving in and out of each station, and delves into some of the passengers’ backstories, whether it’s a granny who grew up by the sea or an overworked young pupil. Kim’s watercolour illustrations are full of feeling – one standout image places the reader inside the carriage at the exact moment the doors fling open and strangers stare directly at us. A bestseller in Korea, this is one of the finest picture-book portraits of city life that I have ever read, and a beautiful reminder that humans the world over share many of the same worries and emotions, and the same daily rhythms.

2/8/2022,"Amid the sound and fury of the Brian Flores lawsuit, you may have forgotten that the Super Bowl kicks off on Sunday at Los Angeles’ SoFi Stadium. As challenging as it is to pick a winner between the Cincinnati Bengals and the hometown Rams – barely a field-goal favourite, by Vegas’ reckoning—one team has already lost: the Chargers. You remember the Chargers. They’re the other NFL team that calls Los Angeles home, the one with the cute yellow lightning bolt on the sides of their helmets. Of course for 55 years they were the San Diego Chargers, the pro sports standard bearer for a sleepy SoCal idyll famous for sun and fun (they actually started life in LA before heading south in 1961 after a single season). In San Diego, they were one of the league’s heritage teams, in that group of pioneering AFL franchises with the Raiders and the Chiefs. Among other things, the Chargers were the team where Al Davis got started in pro football and where the vertical passing game was laboratory tested and perfected. They played at Jack Murphy Stadium, an architectural marvel that played host to three Super Bowls and two World Series – handling one of each in 1998.  For a time they seemed an ideally situated franchise – beloved by locals, nationally respected and synonymous with a town any football fan would kill to visit in December or January – and opposing fans from Chicago or Cleveland were famous for taking over the Murph. As someone who mainly attended games there as a member of the working press, the real treat was being able to watch the action from a lower bowl, outdoor press box. I can think of few better ways to spend a 72-degree fall Sunday. Of course the picture in San Diego was not all sunny. The Chargers fanbase could be fickle (I was too when I lived in San Diego). The city, while nationally renowned, was a small market relative to California’s other NFL towns. And after the turn of the century the Murph was a dilapidated relic that couldn’t compete with JerryWorld, University of Phoenix Stadium and other football Taj Mahals. Seeing the writing crumbling from his stadium walls Dean Spanos, the Chargers’ longtime steward, did that thing all bajillionaires sports owners do when they feel the market has dealt them a bad hand; he threatened to move to Las Vegas or Oakland or Timbuktu unless the city built him a new stadium. And when his corporate welfare stickup was rebuffed, because San Diegans are awesome, Spanos took his ball and went north on I-5 to LA, leaving the town with a giant hole where a civic institution used to be. Talk about a copycat league. The Chargers didn’t just follow the Rams (formerly of St Louis) to the City of Angels; they’re little better than dollar-per-year subletters at SoFi Stadium, the pet project of Walmart consort and Rams owner Stan Kroenke. Before moving into SoFi in 2020, the Chargers played inside a black box MLS stadium in Carson, which – culturally and sometimes with traffic – is about as far from Hollywood as Dubuque. And while they’re not the only NFL teams to share a stadium – New York’s teams share one in New Jersey – the Giants and Jets at least are an unbroken tradition in the TriState. The Rams and Chargers – who started in LA in 1946 and 1960, respectively – had been gone too long for locals to remember why they should care about them in the first place. In the interregnum the Raiders, Dallas Cowboys and the USC Trojans became LA’s football teams. If there’s anything LA respects, it’s a winner. So it figures that now that the Rams are playing in their second Super Bowl in three years, and on their home field to boot, the Chargers barely register. In a recent survey designed to weed out the “saddest” NFL fans, or those “most emotionally upset” by wins and losses, the Chargers ranked dead last – which provides some sense of the depth of apathy here. Attendance is another quality indicator, and before the move to SoFi – again, the Rams’ house – the Chargers came in dead last through the turnstiles, too. And while LA Chargers crowds have picked up since they moved into SoFi, the vaccines rolled out and the superb young quarterback Justin Herbert came to town, at the end of the day, most of that lucre flows to Kroenke’s Rams. It didn’t have to be this way. Besides the best town and loyal fans, the San Diego Chargers had another thing going for them. They were less than 20 miles away from Mexico, the closest NFL team besides the Detroit Lions and the Buffalo Bills to an international border. Had Spanos been thinking ahead, he could’ve owned the Mexican market decades before the Cowboys, Raiders and 49ers set up shop. While the league was establishing games in London as a thing, it was also drawing similarly sized crowds for kickoffs in Mexico City. Spanos could have expanded his market to include an entire country, encroached deeper into Latin America and used those riches to build the stadium of his dreams. Given the NFL’s world-conquering ambitions and its efforts to ingratiate itself with the Latin community, leave no doubt: this is a massive fail. The Chargers could have been exemplars – first to take off outside the US, leading the NFL’s foreign expansion, a more valuable franchise than perhaps even the Cowboys. Instead, they’re a second-class team in an A-list town. Only a bajillionaire detached from reality could see this as winning.",Sport/Sport,"Whoever wins the Super Bowl, the Los Angeles Chargers have lost",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/08/los-angeles-chargers-popularity-san-diego-nfl-football
2/8/2022,"A police officer charged with murdering an Aboriginal man said “it’s all good, he was stabbing me, he was stabbing you” seconds after the fatal shooting, a court has heard. Zachary Rolfe, 30, shot dead Kumanjayi Walker in November 2019 while trying to arrest him at the remote community of Yuendumu, 300km north-west of Alice Springs.  Rolfe’s trial started in Darwin on Monday. The court has heard Rolfe shot Walker three times after he had attempted to arrest him in relation to an outstanding warrant at Walker’s grandmother’s house in Yuendumu. Walker had been asked to put his hands behind his back by Rolfe only seconds after police entered the property. But instead Walker pulled a pair of medical scissors from his right pocket and brought them down in a stabbing motion into Rolfe’s left shoulder. Rolfe’s colleague, Constable Adam Eberl, then struggled with Walker, who was shot soon after for the first time by Rolfe, the court heard. The first shot is not subject to any charges. Prosecutor Philip Strickland SC told the Northern Territory supreme court on Tuesday that as Eberl and Walker struggled on a mattress on the floor, Eberl gained control of Walker. Strickland said Erbel was on top of the 19-year-old Warlpiri man, whose right arm, which had been holding the scissors, was pinned under him. Rolfe walked across the room, placed his left hand on Eberl’s back, and pressed his right hand, holding his Glock semi-automatic handgun, against the left side of Walker’s body, Strickland said. Rolfe then pulled the trigger twice in quick succession, in what Strickland said on Monday was known as a “double-tap” designed to ensure maximum damage. It is the second and third shots that are subject to the murder charge. If a jury finds Rolfe not guilty of murder, he faces a charge of manslaughter, and if he is found not guilty of that charge, a further charge of engaging in a violent act causing death. The police officer has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Strickland said that moments after Rolfe shot Walker for the final time, Eberl said to Walker: “Don’t fuck around, I’ll fuckin’ smash ya mate.” But Strickland said Eberl also said to Rolfe, “Did you – fuck”, to which Rolfe responded “It’s all good, he was stabbing me – he was stabbing you”. Strickland said Rolfe also mentioned that Walker had scissors. But he said the comment about the stabbings could indicate Rolfe knew he had “gone too far”. “When he said those words, he knew that the shots were not necessary or reasonable,” Strickland said. “In short: he said those words in order to justify what he had done.” Strickland also said in his opening to the trial that the jury would hear evidence Rolfe ignored a detailed arrest plan for Walker, and that some officers, including Rolfe, had been critical of previous attempts to arrest him. He said that after discussions between Walker’s family, the local Yuendumu Sgt Julie Frost, and an Aboriginal community police officer, arrangements were made for Walker to hand himself in after his great uncle’s funeral, on the night of 9 November, 2019. If he did not surrender, Walker was to be arrested the following day at 5am, when it was hoped he was asleep, limiting the chances of a confrontation. Strickland said Walker had an extensive criminal history including offences relating to the assault of police and escaping custody, and on 6 November 2019 he had threatened two officers with an axe as they tried to arrest him. His outstanding warrant related to removing an electronic monitoring device and leaving a residential alcohol rehabilitation program, which family members say he had done to attend the funeral. Rolfe and colleagues based in Alice Springs had viewed footage of the 6 November incident multiple times and were critical of the officers involved, Strickland said. They had been sent the detailed arrest plan for 10 November, and screenshots of part of it were later found on Rolfe’s phone, while they were en route to Yuendumu on 9 November to assist in the arrest and provide high-visibility police patrols in the context of medical staff leaving town. But, Strickland alleged, not long after he arrived in Yuendumu, and having been instructed by Frost to do patrols of the community, Rolfe and other officers (not including Frost) instead made their way directly to a property known as House 577, where Walker often stayed with his partner. Rolfe spoke to Walker’s partner’s father, Strickland said, and those conversations led them to believe Walker was at another property, known as House 511, where his grandmother lived. At House 511, Strickland said, a woman questioned Erbel about why one of the officers (not Rolfe) had an AR-15 assault rifle. Strickland said four of the Alice Springs-based officers were from the immediate response team, which could be called to high-risk incidents and had access to high-calibre weapons, and they had been specifically requested to assist in arresting Walker the following day if required. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Strickland said that when Erbel was asked, “Why’s he got a gun? Like he’s aiming to shoot someone” he responded that the officer was not aiming to shoot anyone, and the weapon could not be kept in a holster. Strickland said Erbel then told the woman: “Someone probably shouldn’t run at police with an axe, yeah?” Strickland said Erbel, followed by Rolfe, entered the house soon after, despite the arrest plan, and what the prosecution would argue is evidence that their police training discouraged such actions. “The struggle and those events that unfolded once the accused and Eberl had entered 511, are the very things that Frost’s operational plan was designed to avoid,” he said. Strickland said Rolfe also repeatedly put his hand on his weapon in the earlier “clearing” of House 577, and failed to issue clear directions to Walker before shooting him on the second and third occasions – both of which he described as further breaches of police training. David Edwardson QC, for Rolfe, said he would defend his actions as being reasonable and justifiable in the context of the danger faced by him and Erbel. Edwardson said Rolfe was acting in self-defence, and to defend the life of Erbel, when he fired the second and third shots, and his training had emphasised that “edged weapon equals gun”. Walker had a propensity for violence and had attacked Rolfe in a dark and confined space, he said, with the police officers having to make decisions without the “luxury” of being about to consider tactical options “frame by frame”. “He could not press the pause button,” Edwardson said. “He made a split-second decision to fire shots two and three.” The first witness in the trial, Sgt Robert Kent, who was not in Yuendumu at the time of the shooting, confirmed that NT police training did include the phrase “edged weapon equals gun”. But he said a range of circumstances had to be considered before drawing a weapon, and that each stage of the process – issuing commands, placing a hand on a firearm, drawing, pointing, and firing a firearm – were all considered an “escalation”. The trial before Justice John Burns is expected to continue until late February.",News/Australia news,"Zachary Rolfe trial: police officer said ‘it’s all good – he was stabbing me’ moments after Indigenous man was shot, court hears",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/08/zachary-rolfe-trial-police-officer-said-its-all-good-he-was-stabbing-me-moments-after-indigenous-man-was-shot-court-hears
2/8/2022,"Boris Johnson will not apologise for remarks linking Keir Starmer to the failure to prosecute Jimmy Savile, a minister has said, as Conservative MPs called on the prime minister to back down after protesters shouted abuse at the Labour leader on Monday. Ten Tory MPs called for Johnson to retract and apologise for the claims he made in the House of Commons last week, after anti-vaccine protesters surrounded Starmer near parliament and called him a “paedophile protector” and yelled “Jimmy Savile”. One demonstrator carried a noose.  Chris Philp, the digital minister, said the comment that Starmer had failed to prosecute the prolific child sex offender was “not incorrect” but said the prime minister had clarified he did not mean Starmer took the decision when he led the CPS. “The first comments in the house on the previous Monday were capable of being misconstrued and that is why it is important and right that a couple of days later that Boris Johnson, the prime minister, did clarify that he was not suggesting at any time that Keir Starmer had personal responsibility for the case,” he told BBC Breakfast. “But he obviously did have responsibility for the conduct of the CPS. “I don’t think there is any way you can reasonably suggest that the comments on Keir Starmer’s overall responsibility for the CPS in any way provoked the very unseemly and totally unacceptable harassment we saw last night.” A Number 10 source said that the prime minister did not intend to go further than his condemnation of the abuse of Starmer. Johnson’s initial comments did not suggest Starmer had taken institutional responsibility, but said as director of public prosecutions he “spent more time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile”. Labour MPs expressed fury at the abuse of Starmer and the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, in Westminster on Monday, with the pair forced into a police car to be escorted away from the crowd. Tories including the chief whip, Julian Smith, and the select committee chair Simon Hoare said Johnson should apologise. Others who also voiced concern at the consequences of the prime minister’s rhetoric included the former cabinet ministers David Davis and Caroline Nokes and ex-ministers Stephen Hammond and Tobias Ellwood, as well as MPs elected in 2019, Anthony Mangnall, Aaron Bell and Rob Largan. The sister and husband of Jo Cox, the Labour MP murdered in 2016 by a far-right extremist, also warned about the consequences of politicians lending credence to far-right conspiracies. Cox’s husband, Brendan, said the prime minister’s choice to “inject poison into politics” with his comment had “unintended consequences”. “If it was a one-off, I think we could be more sanguine about it,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I think the people that are directly responsible for what happened yesterday were the people that did it. However, it’s also true that if you inject poison into politics, that has a whole set of unintended consequences that people will react to in different ways and at times that can lead over into intimidation, it can lead over to violence, it can lead over into extremism.” Cox’s sister Kim Leadbeater, who is MP for her seat of Batley and Spen, said: “I’m incredibly angry and upset by the scenes we saw yesterday. I keep thinking about Keir and David’s families and friends. But these things don’t just happen. “Words have consequences, leaders have a duty to behave responsibly and politics is not a game. Our country deserves far better.”",News/UK news,"Johnson will not apologise for Jimmy Savile remarks, says minister",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/08/boris-johnson-jimmy-savile-remark-not-apologise
