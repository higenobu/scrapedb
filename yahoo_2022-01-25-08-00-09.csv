1/25/2022,"While you can start Social Security payments at age 62, your monthly checks are reduced if you begin collecting benefits at this age. To claim your full benefit, you need to sign up for Social Security at your full retirement age, which varies by birth year. Here's a look at how the Social Security retirement age is changing, and what this means for your retirement payments: -- An older Social Security full retirement age. -- A bigger reduction if you claim Social Security early. -- Less of a benefit for delaying claiming Social Security. -- The Medicare eligibility age remains the same. -- You need to carefully determine the optimal age to start Social Security. An Older Social Security Full Retirement Age The full retirement age used to be 65 for those born in 1937 or earlier. Those born between 1943 and 1954 have a full retirement age of 66. The full retirement age further increases in two-month increments each year to 66 and 10 months for those born in 1959, up from 66 and eight months for those with a birth year of 1958. The full retirement age for those who turn age 62 in 2022, born in 1960, is 67. The full retirement age will remain age 67 for everyone born in 1960 or later. [Read: Social Security Changes Coming in 2022] A Bigger Reduction If You Claim Social Security Early Workers who are eligible for Social Security can start payments at age 62, regardless of their full retirement age. However, the benefit reduction for early claiming is bigger for those who have an older retirement age. ""You get less if you start early or more if you delay until later,"" says Andy Landis, author of ""Social Security: The Inside Story."" ""Every month you delay Social Security up to age 70 gets you a higher monthly payment for life."" Workers born in 1960 will see their monthly payments reduced by 30% if they sign up for Social Security at age 62, compared to a 29.17% benefit reduction for those born in 1959 and a 25% decrease for those born in 1954. For a worker eligible for a $1,000 monthly Social Security benefit at his full retirement age, claiming at age 62 will reduce his monthly payment to $750 if his birth year is 1954 and $700 if he was born in 1960. ""Relative to an earlier full retirement age, a later full retirement age means that the person gets less money per month regardless of when they file,"" says Mike Piper, a certified public accountant and author of ""Social Security Made Simple."" Social Security's annual cost-of-living adjustments will be applied to these reduced payments, resulting in a smaller dollar value of the inflation adjustments as well. [READ:  How Much You Will Get From Social Security.] Less of a Benefit for Delaying Claiming Social Security You can increase your monthly Social Security payments by delaying claiming Social Security after your full retirement age up until age 70. However, those who have an older retirement age have fewer months to delay claiming Social Security and less of an opportunity to earn delayed retirement credits. ""If a person files at age 70, if they had a full retirement age of 66, that means they waited 48 months beyond full retirement age, so they would get 132% of their primary insurance amount,"" Piper says. ""But if they file at 70 with a full retirement age of 66 and six months, that means they waited 42 months beyond full retirement age, so they would only get 128% of their primary insurance amount."" The Medicare Eligibility Age Remains the Same While the Social Security full retirement age has increased over the past several years, the age when workers qualify for Medicare has remained age 65. Those who delay claiming Social Security until their full retirement age or later still need to sign up for Medicare at age 65 or maintain other group health insurance based on current employment to avoid hefty Medicare late enrollment penalties. While many retirees have their Medicare premiums withheld from their Social Security checks, those who enroll in Medicare before starting Social Security will have to pay premiums out of pocket. [See: 10 Ways to Increase Your Social Security Payments.] Carefully Determine the Optimal Age to Start Social Security Your age when you begin Social Security payments plays a big role in the amount you will receive throughout retirement. But regardless of your birth year, there are several ways to boost your monthly Social Security payments, including delaying claiming, continuing to work and coordinating benefits with a spouse. ""When to claim benefits should be something that people take the time to analyze and make sure they know the impact of their decision,"" says Angie Furubotten-LaRosee, a certified financial planner at Avea Financial Planning in Richland, Washington. ""By delaying to at least full retirement age, right now between 66 and 67, or even delaying until age 70, people can increase the amount they will receive.""",Business/U.S.News & World Report,The Social Security Retirement Age Increases in 2022,https://news.yahoo.com/social-security-retirement-age-increases-142952575.html
1/25/2022,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Former New York Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, one of the most powerful figures in state government for two decades before his conviction on corruption charges, has died in federal custody. He was 77. Silver died Monday, a person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. The cause of death wasn't immediately available. Silver’s supporters had said he was in failing health from multiple medical conditions. He had been serving time at a prison medical center in Massachusetts. The Manhattan Democrat, who told a judge he prayed he would not die in prison, had been serving a more than six-year sentence for using his clout in state government to benefit real estate developers, who rewarded Silver by referring lucrative business to his law firm. Silver’s conviction ended a nearly four-decade career in the Assembly. He first won a seat representing Manhattan’s Lower East Side in 1976. Though he cut a low-key figure in the halls of the state Capitol, carefully parsing out comments in a baritone mumble, he was a consummate practitioner of Albany’s inside game. He became Assembly speaker in 1994, a powerful position that put him on equal footing with the governor and state Senate leader when it came to making key decisions about annual budgets or major legislation. In all, Silver served as speaker during the tenure of five New York governors, from Mario Cuomo to Andrew Cuomo. He became known as an inscrutable and stubborn negotiator, blocking proposals so often he was sometimes called “Dr. No.” Some of his obstructionist reputation had to do with being the lone Democrat at the negotiating table during Republican Gov. George Pataki’s three terms, during which time the GOP also controlled the state Senate. He helped scuttle former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s plan to locate a football stadium on Manhattan’s West Side. And he took the brunt of the blame for the collapse in 2008 of Bloomberg’s congestion-pricing plan for Manhattan, which would have charged electronic tolls for driving through the borough’s most highly trafficked neighborhoods. The exasperated mayor put out a press release saying it “takes a special kind of cowardice” not to have lawmakers vote on the plan. Silver said he didn’t have the votes. He survived an early tenure coup attempt and became adept at horse-trading to secure education funding, tenants rights legislation and other policies favored by Assembly Democrats. An Orthodox Jew, Silver was known to observe Sabbath even during the marathon negotiation sessions that preceded annual budget deadlines and the end of legislative sessions. Over time, he became a symbol of Albany’s much-maligned opaque style of governance and, ultimately, a target of federal prosecutors. Prosecutors accused Silver of trading his influence for money. In one instance, they argued that Silver persuaded a physician to refer asbestos cancer patients to his law firm so it could seek multimillion-dollar settlements from personal injury lawsuits, a secret arrangement that allowed him to collect about $3 million in referral fees. In return, prosecutors said he directed hundreds of thousands of dollars in state grants to a research center run by the doctor. Silver’s lawyer argued that his client was entitled to accept payments for outside work. His original 2015 conviction was tossed out by an appeals court after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the definition of a corrupt act. He was convicted again at a second trial in 2018 tailored slightly to conform to the high court ruling. But an appeals court ultimately threw out the conviction related to the asbestos cancer patients, citing a faulty instruction to the jury. Prosecutors decided not to retry him on that charge. In the part of his conviction that stuck, the court found that he had supported legislation that benefited real estate developers who were referring tax business to a law firm that employed him. Silver gave up his leadership position following his arrest in January 2015 and lost his legislative seat upon his first conviction that November. Silver joined a long list of state lawmakers, including other top leaders, who have been sentenced for crimes including bribery, conspiracy, tax evasion, fraud and racketeering. One of the leaders with whom he shared power during his time as speaker, Republican state Senate Majority Leader Dean Skelos, was convicted of extortion, wire fraud and bribery in a case that moved through the courts at roughly the same time as Silver’s case. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who had shared power with Silver, resigned from office last summer amid sexual harassment allegations. Silver begged for mercy ahead of his sentencing in a letter to the judge. “I pray I will not die in prison,” Silver wrote, saying he was “broken-hearted” that he damaged the trust people have in government. Silver was furloughed from prison for several days in May before federal authorities denied him home confinement. Silver was the youngest of four children of Russian immigrants. His father ran a wholesale hardware store. As an adult, he and his wife had four children and lived in a lower Manhattan apartment blocks from his first home. He received a bachelor’s degree from Yeshiva University and a law degree from Brooklyn Law School. ___ Balsamo reported from Washington.",Politics/Associated Press,"Sheldon Silver, NY power broker sent to prison, dead at 77",https://news.yahoo.com/sheldon-silver-ny-power-broker-212731828.html
1/25/2022,"An F-35C experienced a ""landing mishap"" on the deck of aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson Monday. The pilot ejected safely and is stable, but seven other sailors were injured. The cause of the incident is under investigation. A US Navy pilot bailed out of an F-35C stealth fighter after a landing mishap on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson while it was conducting operations in the South China Sea, the sea service said Monday afternoon. The unidentified pilot was recovered by a military helicopter and is in stable condition, but seven other Navy personnel were injured in the incident. Four were treated on the ship, while three had to be medically evacuated to a facility in the Philippines. The three who were airlifted off the ship for treatment are stable. The Navy said that the incident and its causes are currently under investigation. The status of the fighter jet is unknown, though it has been reported that it was lost at sea. USS Carl Vinson is the first US Navy aircraft carrier to deploy with the F-35C, a variant of the fifth-generation fighter designed specifically for carrier operations. The air wing features the Navy's first F-35C squadron, the ""Argonauts"" of Navy Strike Fighter Squadron 147. Monday's landing mishap occurred as the carrier conducted operations alongside USS Abraham Lincoln, which recently deployed with not only the first female carrier captain in US Navy history but also the first Marine Corps F-35C squadron, the ""Black Knights"" of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 314. The incident aboard the Carl Vinson Monday is not the first F-35 mishap aboard a carrier. In November 2021, a British pilot flying an F-35B, a short-takeoff/vertical landing variant, had to eject from the aircraft during takeoff while the British Royal Navy's flagship carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth conducted flight operations in the Mediterranean. The pilot, who was recovered and safely returned to the vessel, was assigned to the 617 (Dambusters) Squadron, which was operating alongside a US Marine Corps F-35B squadron at the time of the accident. The mishap aircraft was reported recovered in December.

1/25/2022,"GOP Senate candidate J.D. Vance defended his controversial online rhetoric as evidence of his ""realness."" ""I think it's important for our politicians to have a sense of humor,"" Vance told a local TV reporter. Vance publicly criticized Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric during the 2016 presidential election. Republican Senate candidate J.D. Vance dismissed criticism of his increasingly harsh online rhetoric as attempts at comedy and ""realness,"" despite his past criticism of former President Donald Trump's crude language. Vance, whose bestselling memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" won him widespread attention in 2016, told a Spectrum News reporter at a campaign event on Monday that voters should expect politicians to be ""real people"" and have a ""sense of humor."" ""People may not always agree with my rhetoric, but I think, unfortunately, our country is kind of a joke,"" said Vance, whose campaign has been bankrolled by Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel. ""And we should be able to tell jokes about it."" The reporter specifically referenced Vance's controversial October tweet urging Twitter to let Trump back on the platform so he could weigh in on the fatal shooting on the set of actor Alec Baldwin's movie ""Rust."" Baldwin spent years impersonating Trump on Saturday Night Live, much to Trump's chagrin. Vance told Spectrum News he wasn't the only person who wanted Trump to publicly comment on the tragedy on Baldwin's set. ""Every single person I knew was joking about what would Donald Trump say if he was on Twitter,"" Vance said. ""So I think the idea that we can't have somewhat offensive humor sometimes from our politicians is basically just asking us to have fake politicians all the time."" While Vance's Baldwin tweet attracted particularly widespread condemnation, the candidate has increasingly embraced more controversial, Trumpian rhetoric, using terms such as ""degenerate liberals"" and ""neurotic lunatics"" to describe his opponents online. Ahead of the 2016 presidential election, Vance publicly took issue with Trump's rhetoric, tweeting that he found Trump ""reprehensible"" and that ""God wants better of us."" He's since said he was ""wrong about"" Trump and deleted many of his tweets criticizing him. Vance argued on Monday that ""somewhat offensive humor"" shouldn't be off limits for politicians. ""Maybe it turns some people off, but I think the realness turns more people on,"" he said. Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Republican Senate candidate J.D.

1/25/2022,"Following the activation of its C-band 5G network last week, AT&T is now upgrading its fiber-based broadband service with two new plans that top out at 2Gbps and 5Gbps, respectively. The company says its new multi-gig fiber broadband will be available in more than 70 metro areas including Dallas, LA and Atlanta. Currently, AT&T’s fiber broadband covers around 15 million customers across 90 markets, with the ISP looking to expand its network to reach more than 30 million customers by 2025. While AT&T’s new 5 GIG plan is almost certainly overkill for a typical household (even with a bunch of people making Zoom calls at the same time), the ongoing pandemic and shift towards working and schooling from home continues to put a strain on families with more limited internet. The new 2 GIG plan is set to start at $110 per month plus tax (or $225 a month for a business fiber), while the faster 5 GIG plan will cost $180 per month (or $395 a month for businesses). Notably, AT&T describes both plans as offering “symmetrical” speeds, which means customers should see equally fast download and upload speeds. That last part is important for anyone who has to move large files around, especially when a lot of older internet plans often featuring upload speeds that are significantly lower than download speeds. In addition to its new multi-gig fiber plans, AT&T is updating its fiber internet plans with more straightforward pricing. AT&T says this means new customers won’t get hit with any equipment fees, data caps or annual contracts, with initial pricing locked in for at least 12 months. So your bill should just be the price of the service plus tax, with AT&T throwing in perks such as its ActiveArmor internet security, speedy Wi-Fi 6 routers, and a free HBO Max subscription for customers with top-tier plans (either the gigabit, 2 GIG or 5 GIG plans). So, while AT&T’s new fiber plans aren’t cheap, they should supply ample bandwidth for data-hungry people like content creators and stream video enthusiasts.

1/25/2022,"A federal lawsuit was filed Monday against a Lake Worth police officer, accusing him of using excessive force by running over an unarmed man with a sport utility vehicle during a foot pursuit in November 2020. Dustin Bates of Denton County suffered three fractured ribs, a broken right leg and a fractured spine in the incident, video of which was captured on the officer’s dash camera. The lawsuit identified the Lake Worth officer as Jonathan Granado. Lake Worth police could not be reached Monday for comment on the lawsuit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District in Texas in Fort Worth. Bates was riding a motorcycle on Nov. 23, 2020, in Lake Worth when Granado pulled in behind him and radioed that he could not see Bates’ license plate. Seconds later, Granado gave the license plate number to dispatch, and determined it did not match the motorcycle Bates was driving, according to the lawsuit. Granado turned on his overhead lights, signaling he was pulling over Bates for a traffic stop because of the license plate issue. Bates did not pull over, and he accelerated and drove away from the Lake Worth officer. After a brief pursuit, Bates exited the highway, but he lost control of the motorcycle, which then went down in a grassy area. Bates stood up and then began to run into a field as he saw the Lake Worth officer approaching at a high rate of speed. According to the lawsuit, Bates was moving to get out of the way of Granado’s vehicle. Granado’s dash camera video showed that Bates ran across a road into a field. and Granado turned his vehicle into the field as he began to track Bates. Several images from the dash camera showed Granado driving toward Bates. According to a Grand Prairie Police Department investigation into the incident, Granado was driving about 45 mph when he hit Bates’ back with the SUV. Granado stopped after striking Bates. The squeal of Granado’s brakes can be heard only after he ran over Bates, according to the lawsuit.

1/25/2022,"A Wisconsin court granted a hospital's request to block 7 healthcare workers from starting jobs at a competitor. ThedaCare said its workers leaving has strained the hospital as COVID-19 cases rise in Wisconsin. 1 in 5 healthcare workers quit their job during the pandemic, some due to poor work environments. A Wisconsin court has granted a hospital's request to block seven healthcare workers from leaving to start new jobs at a competitor. ThedaCare, a hospital in Appleton, Wisconsin, asked the court for a temporary restraining order to prevent the employees from accepting jobs at Ascension Northeast Wisconsin, a competitor hospital. Mark J. McGinnis, a judge for the Outagamie County Circuit Court, granted ThedaCare the temporary restraining order on January 20. Attorneys representing both hospitals agreed to meet the morning of January 24 to see if they could come to another resolution. The granted order states Ascension must either give back ThedaCare a radiology technician and a registered nurse out of the seven workers resigning, or cease the hiring of all seven workers until ThedaCare has hired replacements. The Appleton Post-Crescent's Madeline Heim reported ThedaCare said in a complaint that Ascension had ""poached"" the hospital's workers as the region struggles amid a rise in COVID-19 cases. ThedaCare put non-urgent elective surgeries on hold last week due to both a record number of COVID-19 patients and a high absent rate of team members due to illness. But Ascension released a statement that said the ThedaCare employees applied for open job postings without prior recruitment. ""It is Ascension Wisconsin's understanding that ThedaCare had an opportunity but declined to make competitive counter offers to retain its former employees,"" the hospital said in a statement to a local ABC affiliate. ""Given the unfortunate decision by ThedaCare to file a lawsuit to enjoin competitive labor practices, we will not be commenting further as this matter proceeds through litigation."" Timothy Breister, one of the ThedaCare employees who received a job offerv from Ascension, submitted a letter to the judge that said he and his coworkers applied to Ascension because they believed it provided a better work/life balance, according to the Post-Crescent. —Madeline Heim (@madeline_heim) January 22, 2022 ThedaCare and Ascension Northeast Wisconsin were unavailable for additional comment. In the years since the pandemic began, some healthcare workers said they felt unsupported by hospital administrations. For example, nurses recently told Insider their employers were threatening them with pay cuts if they did not come into work days after testing positive for COVID-19. Research from the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing shows nurse burnout and job dissatisfaction stems from poor work conditions, characterized by hospitals that don't allow nurses to have a say in their practice, disorganized work environments, and limited resources.

1/25/2022,"Former President Donald Trump said the Ukraine-Russia crisis never would've happened on his watch. But Trump was impeached, in part, for withholding millions in military aid to Ukraine. Experts said Trump's presidency emboldened Putin. Former President Donald Trump on Monday said the escalating Russia-Ukraine crisis never would've happened on his watch, ignoring the fact that he was impeached over a scandal involving the withholding of military aid to Kyiv, while pressuring it to investigate his political rivals. ""What's happening with Russia and Ukraine would never have happened under the Trump administration. Not even a possibility,"" Trump said. Trump was impeached in 2019 partly because he'd pushed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, then one of his top political rivals, while freezing about $400 million in vital military aid to the former Soviet republic. The Trump administration officially put a hold on the aid roughly 90 minutes after Trump's infamous July 25 phone call with Zelensky, in which he urged the Ukrainian leader to launch an inquiry into Biden and his son Hunter Biden over baseless allegations of corruption. The military aid was released to Ukraine months later after Trump was made aware a whistleblower complaint was filed in relation to the July 25 phone call. Since Russia invaded and annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Ukrainian forces have been engaged in a war against Kremlin-backed rebels in the eastern Donbass region. The US has provided Ukraine with billions in military aid since that year, but Trump threw a wrench into that support in 2019. Throughout his presidency, Trump expressed admiration for autocratic leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, while criticizing US allies and institutions like NATO. Experts say Trump's amicable disposition toward Putin and disdain for international and democratic norms emboldened the Russian president, as well as other strongmen leaders around the world. Fiona Hill, who served as the top Russia advisor on the National Security Council in the Trump administration, in a New York Times op-ed on Monday said Trump's influence on the US gave Putin an opportunity to renew aggression toward Ukraine. ""From Russia's perspective, America's domestic travails after four years of President Donald Trump's disastrous presidency, as well as the rifts he created with US allies and then America's precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan, signal weakness,"" Hill, who was a key witness in Trump's first impeachment, said.
