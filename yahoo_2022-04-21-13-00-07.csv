4/21/2022,"Moskva, Russia's Black Sea flagship, sank Thursday after a suspected Ukrainian missile strike. Families of some crew members are now questioning Russia's claim it fully evacuated the ship. A mother of one crew member told The Guardian she was informed Monday that her son had died. Relatives of crew members aboard the sunken Russian warship Moskva say they haven't been able to locate their loved ones in the days since it went down. The Moskva, a missile cruiser that was the flagship of Russia's Black Sea fleet, sank on Thursday. Russian state media blamed an on-board explosion but Ukraine said it struck the ship with missiles, something the Pentagon later confirmed. The Moskva is thought to have had around 500 crew on board. Russia said the ship was completely evacuated but the families of some crew members have begun questioning that claim. Yulia Tsyvova, whose son Andrei was on board, told The Guardian she didn't receive an update about his whereabouts until Monday, when she received a call from Russia's defence ministry to say he was dead. ""He was only 19, he was a conscript,"" Tsyvova said. ""They didn't tell me anything else, no information on when the funeral would be."" She added: ""I am sure he isn't the only one who died."" Dmitry Shkrebets told The Guardian about his son Yegor, a cook on the Moskva, who was said to be listed as missing in action. ""A conscript who isn't supposed to see active fighting is among those missing in action,"" Shkrebets said. ""Guys, how can you be missing in action in the middle of the high seas?"" Shkrebets said other families had contacted him to say their sons were missing after the Moskva sank. Irina Shkrebets, mother of Yegor, said she went to a hospital to look for her son and discovered about 200 burnt bodies. She told independent Russian news outlet The Insider: ""We looked at every burnt kid. I can't tell you how hard it was, but I couldn't find mine."" She added: ""There were only 200 people, and there were more than 500 onboard the cruiser. Where were the others?"" Russia has been accused of covering up the scale of its military deaths since it invaded Ukraine on February 24. Reports suggest Russia has transported thousands of dead soldiers to Belarus from Ukraine, and Ukrainian officials have said there are thousands of unclaimed Russian corpses in its morgues. Some families of Moskva crew members have learned that their loved ones are alive – not by seeing them in person, but from video shared by the Russian military, The Guardian reported. Some parents were afraid of reprisals from Russia if they were seen to be questioning what happened to their sons, the newspaper said.

4/21/2022,"By Kevin Yao BOAO, China (Reuters) -Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated China's opposition to unilateral sanctions and ""long-arm jurisdiction"" in a speech on Thursday, without directly mentioning the West's punitive actions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine. China has repeatedly criticised western sanctions, including those against Russia, but it has also been careful not to provide assistance to Moscow that could lead to sanctions being imposed on Beijing. Delivering a video speech to the annual Boao Forum for Asia gathering on the southern Chinese island of Hainan, Xi warned that economic ""de-coupling"" and pressure tactics such as severing supply chains would not work. ""China would like to put forward a global security initiative"" that upholds ""the principle of indivisibility of security,"" Xi said. ""We should uphold the principle of indivisibility of security, build a balanced, effective and sustainable security architecture, and oppose the building of national security on the basis of insecurity in other countries."" Russia has insisted that Western governments respect a 1999 agreement based on the principle of ""indivisible security"" that no country can strengthen its own security at the expense of others. China and Russia have grown increasingly close, and China has refused to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special operation"". China has blamed the Ukraine crisis on NATO's eastward expansion. Xi said efforts are needed to stabilise global supply chains, but also said China's economy is resilient and that its long-term trend had not changed. China's economy is facing headwinds from the impact of its aggressive efforts to stem the spread of COVID-19, especially in its economic hub of Shanghai. Xi did not mention China's COVID crisis during the speech.

4/21/2022,"By Joanna Plucinska WARSAW (Reuters) - Russia will retaliate against Poland if its embassy in Warsaw stops working because it cannot receive fresh funds from Moscow, its ambassador warned on Tuesday. In March, Poland expelled 45 Russian diplomats over allegations of working for Russian intelligence and blocked the embassy's bank accounts. Moscow, which dismissed the accusations as baseless, retaliated in kind. ""We have some cash reserves, but they are not unlimited and unless the situation changes, after some time it may so happen that we shall not be in a position to pay our bills,"" Sergiy Andreev, 63, told Reuters. ""And it should be clear that as soon as our embassy stops functioning here, the same will happen to the Polish embassy in Moscow,"" he added. Relations between Russia and Central European countries that once formed part of its sphere of influence have long been fraught but the invasion of Ukraine has fueled fear and suspicion about Moscow's intentions. Andreev did not specify how soon the embassy may run out of cash, but added that about three-quarters of Russian officials who held diplomatic passports were expelled from Poland. A spokesperson for Poland's foreign affairs ministry said 45 Polish diplomats were asked to leave Moscow in retaliation and the Polish embassy's bank accounts were frozen. Andreev said that Poland's stance towards Russia since the Ukraine crisis began on Feb. 24 was particularly hostile, compared to other international partners. ""They are projecting this image of the most unfriendly country towards Russia, in NATO, in the EU, in Europe,"" he said. Poland's decision to expel the Russian diplomats followed similar decisions in the Baltic states and Bulgaria.

Apple’s iPhone 14 Pro is poised to usher in a slight but very distinct design change this year. The notch as we’ve come to know it will be gone, and in its place will be a hole-punch and pill-shaped display cutout. The overall aim of this design is to provide users with even more screen real estate. More broadly, this design shift is likely the first step on a path toward creating a full edge-to-edge display with sensors like Face ID embedded beneath the display itself. It’s worth noting that the design above will reportedly be exclusive to Apple’s iPhone 14 Pro models. However, given Apple’s penchant for debuting new technologies and designs on its premium handsets, it stands to reason that we might see the new iPhone design language become standard on Apple’s 2023 iPhone 15 lineup.

There are a few things to note before diving in. One, the pill-shaped cutout in the video is probably a bit smaller than it will be on the actual device. Two, the camera bump on the iPhone 14 will be slightly larger than it was on the iPhone 13. And three, the overall form factor of Apple’s 2022 iPhone lineup will remain the same. In other words, Apple isn’t reverting to an iPhone design with rounded corners, thankfully. With those qualifications out of the way, this mockup video does a great job of clueing us into the upcoming iPhone 14 Pro design. The end result, in my opinion, is an iPhone with a decidedly sleeker look. For an even closer look at what the new iPhone 14 design will bring to the table, the photo below is probably very close to what the final design is going to look like. It’s a noticeable change, to be sure, but overall I think it’s a step in the right direction. According to the 100% accurate @DSCCRoss, this is actually the new design of the iPhone 14 Pro’s display. Thank you Apple… I hate it… pic.twitter.com/9R6RMyjBuQ — ian (@ianzelbo) January 12, 2022 The new design is certainly interesting, but the main selling point of the iPhone 14 Pro will assuredly be improvements in camera performance. As an aside, iPhone 14 molds surfaced on Weibo over the weekend and do a good job of conveying the slightly thicker camera module on the rear. Weibo via MacRumors The iPhone 14 Pro camera, based on credible reports, sounds like it will be incredible. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a stellar record when it comes to Apple and iPhone rumors, said that the iPhone 14 camera will “elevate mobile phone camera photography to a new level.” Specifically, the iPhone 14 Pro camera will reportedly feature a 48-megapixel sensor on the rear. The sensor itself is said to be 20% larger than its predecessor. Kuo adds: We believe that the new 2H22 ‌iPhone‌ may support direct 48MP output and 12MP (four cells merge output mode) output simultaneously. With 12MP output, the CIS pixel size of the new 2H22 ‌iPhone‌ increases to about 2.5um, which is significantly larger than the ‌iPhone 12‌ and ‌iPhone 13‌, and larger than existing Android phones, and close to the DSC level. Typically, iPhone pricing is the last tidbit to leak out. And seeing as how we’re still a few months away from September, you might want to take this rumor with a grain of salt. With that disclaimer out of the way, there are rumblings that Apple’s iPhone 14 lineup may be $100 more expensive across the board. This is reportedly due to pricier and more advanced components. If this rumor pans out, that means that the iPhone 14 Pro may start at $1099 with the iPhone 14 Pro Max poised to start at $1199.
