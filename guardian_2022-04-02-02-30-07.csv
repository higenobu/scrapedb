4/2/2022,"The 20th-century philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer considered the encounter between the viewer and a work of art to be a dynamic relationship. Meeting a work of art made in the past involves a jolt, a reaction, an actual event, in the present. Coming across the same work of art later will set up another event, another reaction, in which the artwork will be, as it were, activated afresh by the intellect and emotions of the viewer. When we interpret a work of art, we are teasing out its possible meanings in the moment; but those meanings will change, depending on the viewer and the time. Extend this thought into the world of the museum and it becomes clear that these institutions are not simply about the past. They are, necessarily, about the present. Paintings, sculptures, artefacts of all kinds become meaningful in the “now” of their being viewed and considered. They shape us as we excavate new depths from them. In a more purely functional manner, museums are increasingly embracing their capacity to be actors in the present worlds of their communities – rather than simply repositories of things of the past, and gatherers and protectors of collective memories. Neil MacGregor, former director of the British Museum, in his BBC Radio 4 series The Museums That Make Us, is exploring this role, travelling through the UK, visiting museums from the Hepworth Wakefield and the Museum of Making in Derby, to the Tower Museum in Derry and the Museum nan Eilean in Stornoway. He notes along the way that nostalgia is a danger for some of these institutions: there can be a temptation for them to become containers of “loss and longing”, especially when part of their founding impulse may have been, understandably and rightly, to preserve what was on the verge of being erased – whether preindustrial ways of life or, in the post-Thatcher age, manufacturing cultures. Something intriguing can happen when the drift to nostalgia is resisted. An example is Derby’s new Museum of Making, which both salutes the city’s history of manufacturing and aims to foster skills and inspire new acts of ingenuity. That in itself is nothing new, of course: part of the purpose of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London was to encourage innovation in design and manufacturing. But the Museum of Making takes things a step further – hosting, for example, sessions for teachers and educators on fostering environments conducive to creativity, and “maker challenges” for teenagers. In so doing, it bridges the gap between museum and educational institution and inserts itself more fully into the fabric – and future – of the city. It is a welcome shift. Museums, often in the teeth of terrible loss of income thanks to Covid-19 closures, are increasingly becoming ethical actors, as heavily invested in conversations about the kind of places communities want to be as what they once were. It should go without saying that they need to be properly supported to do this, by the government, local authorities and donors. As the effects of Covid continue to bite – and inflation begins to hit – the work of reimagining communities is more important than ever.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on museums and communities: shaping the future | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/01/the-guardian-view-on-museums-and-communities-shaping-the-future
4/2/2022,"Indian IT services company Infosys, in which the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s wife owns an estimated £690m stake and collects about £11.5m in annual dividends, is “urgently” closing its office in Russia. Infosys’s decision to shut its Moscow office comes as pressure mounts on Sunak to answer accusations that his family is collecting “blood money” dividends from the company’s continued operation in Russia despite the invasion of Ukraine. A source at Infosys told the Guardian that the company was “in the process of urgently closing down its Russian operation” and “relocating staff to other countries”. An Infosys spokesperson declined to comment, and would not be drawn on whether the decision to close the Russian office was linked to political pressure mounting on Sunak. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, earlier on Friday called on the chancellor to reveal whether his family had been “benefiting from money made in Russia when the government has put in place sanctions” on firms and individuals following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Sunak, who has repeatedly called on British companies to pull out of Russia in order to “inflict maximum economic pain” on Putin’s regime, had refused to comment on his wife Akshata Murthy’s 0.91% stake in Infosys. Speaking to the BBC’s Newscast after a challenging week in which his spring statement met heavy criticism, he said it was “very upsetting and … wrong for people to try and come at my wife”. Sunak drew parallels with Will Smith, who hit the comedian Chris Rock at the Oscars on Sunday after a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, as well as the beleaguered England cricket captain, Joe Root. The chancellor quipped: “Someone said, ‘Joe Root, Will Smith, and me – not the best of weekends for any of us’. But I feel, on reflection, both Will Smith and me having our wives attacked – at least I didn’t get up and slap anybody, which is good.” Murthy, who keeps a low public profile, is the daughter of the billionaire founder of Indian tech giant Infosys. According to its latest annual report, Murthy holds a stake in the firm worth approximately £690m, which is estimated to have yielded £11.5m in dividend payments over the past year. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticised Sunak over his wife’s investment in the firm, with the shadow transport secretary, Louise Haigh, calling it “really quite shocking”. Asked about such comments, Sunak said: “You know, I think it’s totally fine for people to take shots at me. It’s fair game … It’s very upsetting and, I think, wrong for people to try and come at my wife.” He also defended his father-in-law, the Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy, saying he had “nothing but enormous pride and admiration for everything that he’s achieved, and no amount of attempted smearing is going to make me change that because he’s wonderful and has achieved a huge amount. As I said, I’m enormously proud of him.” While the UK government has ratcheted up sanctions on hundreds of Russian businesspeople and politicians close to Putin’s regime, the Indian government has been more ambivalent in its attitude to the invasion. Infosys had continued to operate in Russia despite most big global IT and consultancy firms such as Accenture, KPMG, McKinsey, Oracle, PwC and SAP all closing their Russian operations. Earlier this week Infosys said it had “a small team of employees based out of Russia, that services some of our global clients, locally”. “We do not have any active business relationships with local Russian enterprises,” the company said, adding that it had committed $1m (£760,000) to help the victims of the war. The ministerial code says that ministers must declare any financial interests that could give rise to a conflict, including those of their spouse and close family. A spokesperson for the chancellor has said Murthy and her family members do not “have any involvement in the operational decisions of the company”.",News/Politics,Infosys to ‘urgently’ shut Moscow office as pressure grows on Rishi Sunak,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/01/infosys-to-urgently-shut-moscow-office-as-pressure-grows-on-rishi-sunak
4/2/2022,"Priti Patel has accepted a £100,000 donation from a company run by one of the world’s most prominent oil traders. A new entry in the home secretary’s members’ interests register shows that she received the funds from Andurand Ventures Ltd. This company is run by Pierre Andurand, a leading oil trader. The hedge fund manager made headlines during 2020 when he successfully predicted that oil prices would hit negative numbers, making significant profits by doing so. He then predicted that oil prices would rocket at the beginning of this year, again profiting. Andurand runs Andurand Capital Management, which describes itself as “a private fund management company in fundamental commodity strategies with a specialisation in the oil and energy complex”. This is believed to be his first political donation. While he trades in oil, he also has a clean energy fund, and the company he runs supports net zero. Andurand, 45, started his career in 2000 as an energy trader for Goldman Sachs in Singapore, then held senior trading roles at Bank of America and Vitol before starting his hedge fund. While his company says it is “a strong supporter of the world’s energy transition away from fossil fuels”, Andurand plans to continue investing in oil in the coming years. He recently said: “We think that oil demand will peak around 2027, then be stable for a few years. and then decline relatively fast in the 2030s. “It will create opportunities in oil trading. For us, it will also create opportunities in energy transition – not just oil – but also natural gas, power, emissions and … copper and nickel that will benefit from more electrification.” Andurand has been vocal about the Russian war on Ukraine, and called for Europe to impose sanctions on Russian hydrocarbons in order to help bring it to a close. Tessa Khan, director of the campaign group Uplift, said: “That the Conservative party is accepting donations from people profiting from the energy crisis is sadly unsurprising. “It has consistently aligned itself with oil and gas interests. It is refusing to put a windfall tax on profits and is contemplating allowing new oil and gas developments, which will do nothing to lower our energy bills, but will allow fossil fuel interests to carry on profiting from the North Sea. “The risk is that decisions are being skewed by a flow of money to Conservative politicians from oil and gas interests.” A spokesperson for Patel said: “All donations are declared in the usual and proper way.” Andurand declined to comment.",News/Politics,"Priti Patel accepts £100,000 donation from firm run by oil trader",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/01/priti-patel-accepts-100000-donation-from-firm-run-by-oil-trader-pierre-andurand

4/2/2022,"George Monbiot’s claim that “our system of organised lying has created an entire class of politicians, officials, media commentators, cultural leaders, academics and intellectuals who nod along with” capitalist orthodoxy is largely true (Putin exploits the lie machine but didn’t invent it. British history is also full of untruths, 30 March). I’m a metro mayor. We’ve run a citizens’ assembly on climate change and are implementing its recommendations. We’ve invested in clean energy and our Green New Deal is operational. We promote our Good Work Pledge, directly tackle child poverty, and are investing in the social and cooperative economy. Our policy objective is to create a zero-carbon, zero-poverty North of Tyne. I call for wealth taxes, and without urgent and crisis-level action, we will destroy our planet’s capacity to support us. I know other leaders in local government who also put their (limited) money where their mouths are, and at least some MPs openly say that we need to replace blind profit-centred economics with an economy focused on social and environmental good. The reason I’m in such a minority, and that “almost everyone in public life subscribes to the same set of preposterous beliefs” is in part down to intimidation. The first question I was asked by a TV journalist after being selected was “are you a Marxist?” (If anything, I’m a libertarian socialist, but try explaining that in 10 seconds!) Britain’s news organisations, even those not owned by a handful of billionaires, are obsessed with political pantomime. Terrified of being labelled radical, politicians self-censor their views on alternative economics or the lethality of the environmental crisis. McCarthyism is alive and well in Britain.Jamie DriscollMetro mayor, North of Tyne  I applaud George Monbiot’s ability to call out widespread delusions about limitless economic growth and the appropriateness of the enormous power wielded by those with great wealth. But I take issue with his use of the term “lying”. The view of empire as a force for good was not built on lies. It was built on self-delusion. To tackle the assumptions about the necessity of “growth” and inequality which Monbiot rightly targets, we need a far better understanding of the process of self-delusion that has driven consensus about what is true – in both the past and the present.Dr Hugh FirthNewcastle upon Tyne  George Monbiot rightly highlights the increasing havoc wrought by “fake news” in recent times on all our lives. Since the very idea of fake news would be unintelligible unless one also had some understanding of what is meant by “truth” and “objectivity”, surely the time has come to make the philosophic analysis of these issues a central focus of the school curriculum. I can think of no better way to inoculate the next generation against this virus of uncritical thinking.Oliver McAdooPulborough, West Sussex  To George Monbiot’s list of accepted “truths” should be added the following common beliefs: war “works” (despite its highly uncertain outcomes, and its untold millions of casualties); stockpiling nuclear weapons capable of destroying the planet is the best way to ensure our “defence” against potential aggressors; the military (whose role after all is to kill when ordered to do so) is a noble profession; and employing many of our ablest scientific brains and spending billions annually on researching ever more “effective” ways of killing people is an honourable and sane use of national resources.Mike GarnierBristol  On reading George Monbiot’s article, I thought: what if, in this platinum jubilee year, the Queen were to announce that she will dispose of her vast wealth – land, real estate, art collections, the spoils of empire accumulated over centuries – and make full reparation to all the countries impoverished by that baleful project?

4/2/2022,"I read your feature with great interest (Welcome to Britain … now what? Afghan families on their lives in limbo, 26 March). My family met, and have subsequently become friends with, an Afghan family airlifted to Britain last August, and since then living in a hotel in Westminster. I recognise the systemic failures of Operation Warm Welcome: specifically the lack of immediate, personal support, and the dismal performance in finding permanent homes – attributable to the UK’s appalling housing crisis, a crisis for everyone in housing need, not just for our new citizens. However, at a local level praise should be given where it is due – to the joint council/Home Office project teams working on the ground. I have seen first-hand that children have been in school since October, adults have received English lessons, GP surgeries have been run in the hotel, dental and opticians services have been made widely available, and communications with the Afghan families, using interpreters, have been excellent. Alongside the organisational response, the specific staff have been warm, friendly and helpful, as have the staff within the hotels. There have been many local initiatives – parties to celebrate Nowruz (Persian new year), Afghan input into the hotel menus – which have run alongside the massive charitable and volunteer response by local communities. I met my friend earlier this week as he prepared to move to a new hotel outside London following the end of the current arrangements.

As he suggests, we need a sustainable strategy for Covid, rather than a pretence that the epidemic has somehow ended. Historical parallels are never exact, but previous experience of other epidemic and endemic diseases would indicate the same. One minor point: Prince Albert’s death was attributed to typhoid, not cholera. This is worth pointing out, because cholera tends to hog the 19th-century limelight, whereas it is possible to argue that typhoid, another waterborne disease, was at least as important both as a cause of death and as a factor in sanitarian reform.Margaret PellingOxford  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Quite apart from the welcome promise of an end to trophy hunting imports, the bill’s other leading measures are greeted across parties and the whole country. These include a ban on domestic advertising of venues abroad where elephants and other endangered species – big cats, apes, bears, dolphins – suffer extreme brutality in tourism, with the UK market taking a shameful lead. Crucially, the bill would steer the market towards ethical tourism, throwing a lifeline to many endangered species and countering claims that cruel exploitation by rides, tricks, games and hunting provide important revenue to certain countries. The 1,000 and more UK-based operators promoting this cruelty contribute nothing to protect humans or animals at these venues.

4/2/2022,"The first UK government-funded scheme linking sponsors with Ukrainian refugees has been launched amid warnings that initiatives aimed at helping people to secure sanctuary in Britain risk becoming “Tinder for sex traffickers”. The charity Reset Communities and Refugees, which has led UK community sponsorship schemes since 2018, has launched a service to pair sponsors and refugees, provide training and assist with safeguarding. It comes two weeks after the government’s Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme opened for visa applications from refugees with a named sponsor. About 4,700 visas had been granted and 32,200 applications had been made under the scheme as of Thursday, according to Home Office figures. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC) has been working to expand the scheme to those without a match and has given £300,000 in initial funding to Reset, which has developed a pilot service that matches refugees with sponsors. It hopes to expand the service more widely after more than 7,000 refugees were initially registered on its website, along with 8,000 UK households, offering places for more than 20,000 refugees. The matching service, which draws on the expertise of a 40-strong team of caseworkers, is being offered to sponsors, refugees, devolved governments, local authorities and organisations that do not have other means of pairing refugees and sponsors. The aim of the scheme is also to help local authorities and other groups assist refugees with challenges including language barriers, education, health needs, bereavement and work. Kate Brown, the chief executive of Reset Communities and Refugees, said: “This is an extraordinary moment for the refugee welcome movement in the UK. With 200,000 people signed up to offer their homes under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, and hundreds of thousands more offering support, we are in a position to help more refugees than ever before. “We must make sure that there are fair and rigorous systems in place to support the refugees and sponsors as they embark on this programme.” The matching team will also be carrying out assessments of the refugees to understand personal circumstances, including if they have ties to a place or particular preferences. Once the match has been made, the sponsors and refugees will be required to submit a visa application to the Home Office which, along with local authorities, will be responsible for the formal vetting process, including DBS checks. The launch of the scheme comes against a backdrop of evidence that UK-based criminals have been targeting women and children fleeing the war. A letter from 16 refugee and anti-trafficking organisations to the communities secretary, Michael Gove, last week said that the Homes for Ukraine scheme was potentially dangerous for refugees who had fled Ukraine. It said the initiative, which allows would-be hosts to be matched with Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in the UK, in effect mimicked the dating app Tinder’s signature “swipe left, swipe right” approach to rejecting or selecting a partner, and had insufficient safeguards. Initial evidence from the letter’s signatories, which include Refugee Action, the Refugee Council and the Helen Bamber Foundation, said traffickers had already appeared to have made attempts to target Ukrainian women and children, as had slum landlords. Last weekend Louise Calvey, the head of safeguarding at the charity Refugee Action, said that “issues with the scheme means that it risks being a Tinder for sex traffickers”. “We are already aware of people with illegal motives who are advertising on social media,” she said. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “No visa is issued by the Home Office until checks have been completed on the Ukrainian applicant as well as on every adult in a sponsor’s household. Local authorities will then run DBS checks on sponsors, with enhanced DBS with barred-list checks for those housing families with children or vulnerable adults. “Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, Ukrainians will be guaranteed free access to NHS healthcare, including mental health care. They will also be able to work and receive benefits. The government has also ensured that local authorities have appropriate levels of funding to support new arrivals.”",News/World news,UK Homes for Ukraine scheme launches amid safeguarding fears,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/uk-homes-for-ukraine-scheme-launches-amid-safeguarding-fears

4/2/2022,"More than 40 years ago, the folk singer Fred Wedlock branded anybody showing a little grey hair who fancied a night on the tiles as that most tragic of figures: “the oldest swinger in town”. But, in 2022, refusing to give up dancing once your skin clears up is no longer a source of shame. Instead, there are enough people in middle age ready to go clubbing that they are taking over venues – until the clock strikes midnight, at least. Annie Mac, one of the nation’s best loved DJs, announced on Friday that she is creating a club night for “Cinderellas” that opens at 7pm and ends at midnight. For music lovers of a certain age, it is a dream come true: an early dinner and a few hours of wild abandon before crawling into bed by 1am. This means the unique rush which comes from raving is now available to those unable to forsake their Saturday morning responsibilities. “Before Midnight is a very simple idea, and sometimes I think the simplest ones are the best ones,” the Irish DJ, whose full name is Annie Macmanus, said. “Everything about it is the same as a typical nightclub except for the time it starts and the time it ends. Nightclubs in the UK open what, 10, 11pm, end 3, 4, 5am.” She added: “That is not accessible for people who need sleep. You shouldn’t have to wait till 1, 2am to see your favourite DJ go on the decks. You should be able to access DJs at an earlier time, in the same way that we can access bands and other music artists. And you should be able to get a good night’s sleep at the end of it.” Mac, 43, said she received messages from people “who adore the clubbing experience but don’t want to wait until 1am in the morning to see me play, who need to be sharp and useful at the weekends and just can’t afford sleepless nights”. And her venture comes amid a growing demand for club nights catering to older people, with a study before the pandemic finding that more than 3.7 million Britons aged 45 and over were going clubbing once a week. Last year, cabinet minister Michael Gove was captured letting loose in an Aberdeen club at 2am. Club nights tailored to older clubbers include Soul Train Disco, an over-25s night club opened in Liverpool last summer by 55-year-old David Thomas – stage name DJ David Soul – who said he hoped to “save club land” for older people. “There was nowhere for us to go,” Thomas said. “I thought, ‘I don’t care if it doesn’t make any money, I’m going to do it, even if I have to dance alone’. Oddly, the entire world came. It’s been rammed every Saturday since we opened.” Another popular night is Haven’t Stopped Dancing Yet, which was set up by 60-year-old Nikki Spencer 12 years ago after she tried and failed go out dancing in Soho one night when she was in her late 40s. “It just dawned on me that there was nowhere that catered to older clubbers,” she said. “When I launched the club night there was so much enthusiasm. People came and said, ‘I’ve been waiting 20 years for this’. They were phoning me, telling me their life stories, like ‘I used to dance back in the day’, or ‘I just had cancer treatment and now I want to go out and bring all my mates’.” She added: “When you get to your 40s or 50s, you’ve got that teenage kid, older parents, and you’re sandwiched between all these responsibilities. So we’re going, ‘just for one night forget about it all and have a good dance’.” Simon Settle, 48, from Leeds said he “still loved clubbing” and that it had become “a part of me”. He added: “I get the same feeling now when I’m in the club and it’s dark and hot and the DJ is playing a great set and everybody is dancing as I did when I first fell in love with house music in 1988. That feeling of togetherness, seeing people smiling, meeting people and dancing has never left me.” Mac left BBC Radio 1 after 17 years last year, was instrumental in breaking major acts, including Mylo and Justice, in the UK. She was also credited with introducing the mainstream to dubstep, and was credited as Europe’s biggest female DJ. For her new event, she will be performing for the entire four hours. “It’s going to be an amazing sound system, you’re going to be able to get all that wild abandon and collective euphoria that you get when you dance in a dark, sweaty room with brilliant people to brilliant music,” she said. “I’m so gassed about this.”  Before Midnight is due to take place in London on Friday 20 May.",Arts/Music,Annie Mac to launch club night ending at 12am ‘for people who need sleep’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/01/annie-mac-to-launch-cinderellas-club-event-that-ends-at-midnight
4/2/2022,"Richard Vallières’s plan to make millions of dollars was deceptively simple: secretly drain the province of Quebec’s strategic maple syrup reserve and then sell the illicit product. But the Quebec man’s daring theft fell short after police were tipped off and he and his accomplices landed in jail. Now, the ringleader behind Canada’s infamous heist has a new challenge: paying his victims C$9m or serving six more years in jail. On Thursday, Canada’s supreme court ruled that Vallières, the mastermind behind “the Great Canada maple syrup heist”, a C$17m caper that spawned a wide ranging investigation – and a Hollywood screenplay – is required to pay back the full amount of the syrup he stole and then sold, not just the profits from his crime spree. Starting in 2011, a group of thieves covertly siphoned syrup from thousands of white metal barrels in warehouses rented by the Federation of Maple Syrup Producers, an organization that represents nearly 7,000 syrup producers and controls nearly 80% of the world’s maple syrup supply. Knowing the barrels in the strategic reserve were inspected only once a year, the thieves replaced the syrup with water. Because the Federation controls the sale of syrup in Quebec, the illicit product was transported over the border to the province of New Brunswick, where it was packaged into smaller batches and sold to both legitimate buyers and black market exporters. In 2012, after an inspector noticed some barrels were empty and others were lighter than they should be, the Federation realized that 9,571 barrels – worth nearly C$18m – had been stolen from under its nose. The theft led to police raids in New Brunswick, Ontario and south of the border in Vermont and New Hampshire. Quebec police arrested 16 people in their investigation, identifying Vallières as the group’s leader. They also seized two forklifts, tanker trucks used to transport the stolen product and four massive kettles used to boil the syrup down. The brazen theft become an episode of the Netflix show Dirty Money. In 2016, Vallières was found guilty of fraud, trafficking and theft and sentenced to eight years in prison, the harshest penalty handed down to those involved in the heist. The judge, Raymond Pronovost, fined him C$9.4m, based on the value of the syrup he was able to sell. Vallières was given 10 years to make the payment, or face a six-year prison term. The judge cited Canadian law, which holds that when stolen property cannot be returned to its owner the fine must be equal to the value of the stolen goods. On appeal, that amount was reduced to only C$1m – the amount Vallières claimed had been the profit on his theft. But on Thursday, Canada’s top court disagreed, arguing that a court doesn’t have the power to diminish a fine and that the original fine should be restored. “Distinguishing between an offender’s income and expenses in order to determine the offender’s profit margin would essentially amount to legitimating criminal activity,” the court wrote. The court said lawmakers in Canada had drafted the criminal code to “deprive offenders of the fruits of their crimes” and to deter them. “Parliament is sending a clear message that ‘crime does not pay’ and is thus attempting to discourage individuals from organizing themselves and committing profit-driven crimes,” the court wrote. Vallières was recently granted day parole after two failed attempts and told the parole board he planned the heist for the lure of large profits, but also to settle a grudge against the Federation. In 2007, he was fined C$1.8m for selling maple syrup illegally. “I wanted revenge [against the Federation] because they pursued me and had my house seized.” But his time behind bars, in a maximum security facility, appears to have left him shaken. At his hearing, Vallières told the board he “saw a guy get killed over a pear – a fight over a pear”. Vallières’s lawyer, Julie Giroux, told reporters her client was disappointed by the decision and that paying back such a large fine would be difficult.",News/World news,Canada’s ‘maple syrup heist’ thief ordered to repay $9m for sweet stolen goods,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/maple-syrup-heist-theif-ordered-repay-stolen-goods-canada
4/2/2022,"Jen Psaki is reportedly set to quit as Joe Biden’s White House press secretary to become a TV host at MSNBC. Axios first reported the move on Friday, citing anonymous sources “close to the matter”. CNN then said it had confirmed the news, and that Psaki was expected to remain in her role through the end of April. Karin Jean-Pierre, the deputy White House press secretary, and Kate Bedingfield, the communications director, were among names touted as possible successors. Axios said Psaki, 43, had been “treading carefully on the ethics and legal aspects of her plans” and had not yet signed a deal, but was in line to host a show on the Peacock streaming service and feature as a guest commentator elsewhere. Axios also said Psaki would not replace Rachel Maddow, the liberal-leaning network’s biggest star, in its 9pm weekday slot, contrary to speculation. Psaki and MSNBC did not comment. A White House official told CNN: “Jen is here and working hard every day on behalf of the president to get you the answers to the questions that you have, and that’s where her focus is.” Psaki worked for Barack Obama’s presidential campaign in 2008 and then in his White House press team. After a spell as spokesperson for the state department she became White House communications director. With Donald Trump in office, Psaki became a commentator for CNN. On returning to the White House in January 2021, she indicated that she expected to work for Biden for not much more than a year. After four chaotic years under Trump, Psaki returned White House press briefings to something like normal order. She became celebrated by some on the left, however, for her sometimes caustic exchanges with reporters prominently including Peter Doocy, a correspondent for Fox News. Last month, Doocy asked Psaki if it was true she was leaving. “I have more than enough on my plate here,” Psaki said. “So you can’t get rid of me quite yet. Sorry, Peter, for you on that.” The path from Brady Briefing Room to TV studio has become well-trodden. Trump’s fourth and last White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, now works for Fox News. Sean Spicer, Trump’s first press secretary, works for Newsmax. Another Trump-era White House official, former acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, this week joined CBS News – a move that reportedly caused controversy among staff. On the left, Symone Sanders, a former adviser to the vice-president, Kamala Harris, is set to begin hosting for MSNBC and Peacock in May. Psaki has contracted Covid-19 twice while working for Biden. In her most recent enforced absence, Jean-Pierre first stepped up to the podium. After Jean-Pierre tested positive, Bedingfield took a turn in the role. In January 2021, Psaki told the New York Times: “I think there frankly needs to be diverse spaces and voices as communicators. Women, certainly, but beyond that.” If she succeeds Psaki in the role, Jean-Pierre would become the first Black person to be White House press secretary. This week, an unnamed Biden official told the Hill: “This administration really cares about showing diversity and representation, so breaking barriers is a big thing. It has felt like Karine has been groomed for this and it would backfire if she didn’t get it.”",News/US news,"Biden press secretary Jen Psaki to become TV host at MSNBC, reports say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/01/jen-psaki-press-secretary-msnbc-white-house
4/2/2022,"As the ground staff brushed the remaining snow from the outfield at Headingley, Yorkshire’s senior coaching team – interim managing director of cricket, Darren Gough, head coach, Ottis Gibson, and captain, Steve Patterson – sat in the cold press box to reflect on a tumultuous six months and the upcoming season. Thursday night’s extraordinary general meeting, which overwhelmingly approved the structural changes demanded by the ECB in the wake of the Azeem Rafiq racism scandal, has given the club some financial stability after the ban from hosting international cricket was lifted. The EGM, said to be held in a business-like atmosphere, approved the appointment of Lord Patel as chair, the appointment of six non-executive directors and removed the Graves Trust’s powers, despite the disdain of the former chair, Robin Smith. Gough, clad in Kukri-sponsored kit – Yorkshire lost their deal with Nike in the winter – spoke with emotion about the future of the club he first played for in 1989 as a bustling teenager. “When I took over in January I saw almost fear in the players’ faces and confusion, but I’ll tell you what, three months later what I have seen and witnessed, is a team that work for each other. They have worked their socks off to get into a position where they are excited about the season … and I am immensely proud of them , and I told them so before we went to Dubai [on a pre-season tour.]” “They understood that not just Yorkshire, but I think cricket in general, needs to change. Sport, society, needs to change. All I can do is put things in place, along with Ottis and the players, we’ve been educated on a daily basis, by people that write articles, by reading, by watching, by communicating.” “People are going to make mistakes, they’re going to continue to make mistakes. But it’s about forgiveness, it’s about education, it’s about moving forward together to make us great again. We want to be on the front and back pages for the right reasons, and we haven’t been. We’ve got an opportunity now with the people we’ve got in place for other cricket clubs to say, that’s how we want to do it going forward. We can only try and make that happen. It’s sad what’s happened, we can never take it back, we can’t forget what’s happened, it’s about learning from it, moving forward and make sure that situation doesn’t happen again.” Yorkshire have signed Pakistan’s Haris Rauf for the first six Championship games and his countryman leg-spinner Shadab Khan for the T20 Blast. Gibson is on a mission to persuade Adil Rashid to play some red-ball cricket. The club are also trying to sign an overseas batsman, with Gary Ballance on indefinite leave with ongoing mental health problems, Tom Kohler-Cadmore an injury doubt after a concussion in the Pakistan Super League and Joe Root unlikely to play until the end of April. Visiting teams can expect to find seamer-friendly conditions awaiting them. “We’d like some help for [Haris Rauf] off the surface for sure,” said Gibson. “I don’t think our batsmen would like to hear that. He bowls 150kph anyway so he doesn’t need that much help but when teams come to play here we want to make this this place a fortress.” The club remain unsure whether or not they will be docked Championship points, a possible sanction from the independent investigation led by the Cricket Disciplinary Commission. “To do it halfway through a season wouldn’t be the best,” said Gough, “but in football they’ve done it with Derby.” Meanwhile, the African-Caribbean Engagement programme is going to expand nationwide with ECB backing. The programme, first established by Surrey in 2020 under the leadership of Ebony Rainford-Brent, and aimed at engaging young people from the black community, will expand to Nottingham, Manchester, Leeds and an additional London borough, after successful uptake in Birmingham and Bristol in 2021. “Although we started small in south London, we always envisaged this programme was going to have a big national impact,” said Rainford-Brent. “To be in six cities and on both sides of the Thames in London within two years of existence proves that our model is starting to change the game.” The ECB funding comes as part of an update to its 12-step racism and diversity action plan established in the wake of Rafiq’s allegations which will also see the expansion of the ECB’s community talent champion programme, offer a further 3,000 foundation coaching bursaries and conduct a review of dressing-room culture in professional cricket.",Sport/Sport,Yorkshire out to change cricket after winter spent learning from mistakes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/01/yorkshire-out-to-change-cricket-after-winter-spent-learning-from-mistakes
4/2/2022,"If there is one role that epitomised the quirky charm of the actor Ralph Riach, it was John James McIver in Hamish Macbeth. Riach, who has died aged 86, played the character known as “TV John” in the whimsical mid-1990s BBC Scotland series with a winning air of innocence and wisdom. Those qualities were a perfect match for John, the clairvoyant colleague of Robert Carlyle’s rural police officer in the fictional town of Lochdubh. In his black beret and buttoned-up shirt, he had a seriousness of purpose offset by an edge of eccentricity. Those same qualities were evident in a varied stage and screen career that began only in his late 40s. His TV roles included Willy Stebbings in the ITV series Chancer (1990-91) and Dr Gilmore in Doctor Finlay (1993-94), while on film he played a priest in Braveheart (1995) and Ernie in Cloud Atlas (2012). The youngest of three brothers, born and educated in Elgin, Moray, he had his first taste of acting at eight in a boys’ club show and was given piano lessons from 11, but took what he called the “safe route” into office work. His jobs were many. He worked as an architectural draughtsman, in New Scotland Yard and as a furniture upholsterer. In Perth, where he became a theatrical landlord, his guests included the actors Richard Todd and Jimmy Logan. The latter advised against an acting career but went on to give him his first professional job in a 1984 staging of Ray Cooney’s Run for Your Wife. He was in his mid-40s when he enrolled as a drama student at what is now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow. A year behind him was a 17-year-old Alan Cumming, now a Hollywood and Broadway star. “It was like having your dad at college,” said Cumming who played Dionysus alongside Riach’s Tiresias in John Tiffany’s 2007 production of The Bacchae for the National Theatre of Scotland (NTS). “Ralph would go, ‘Alan Cumming, you missed a movement class this morning because you were hungover. Do you know how many people would like your place on this course? Don’t you miss a class again.’ We were friends ever since.” Coming to theatre late in life gave Riach a certainty of purpose. “I found him very restful because he knew who he was and was content in his skin,” said the actor Siobhan Redmond, who met him in the 1980s working on Liz Lochhead’s play The Big Picture. She also played alongside him in Mary Stuart for the NTS (2006) and Karen Gillan’s directorial movie debut The Party’s Just Beginning (2018). His earliest professional work was in Logan’s popular comedies, but he gravitated towards the challenges of new writing. In the landmark 1985 season at the Traverse theatre in Edinburgh, he starred in Jo Clifford’s Losing Venice and Chris Hannan’s Elizabeth Gordon Quinn. “As William Quinn in Elizabeth Gordon Quinn, he was so moving and truthful,” recalled his fellow actor Simon Donald. “When he walked out of the family home, he flung his hat on the ground as a gesture of pique and it hit his foot so it looked really weak; instead of being a grand gesture, it became this silly thing. He made that moment.” In John McKay’s 1988 hit comedy Dead Dad Dog, also for the Traverse, Riach played a cantankerous ghost opposite Sam Graham as the son who had buried him 12 years earlier. Stephen Unwin’s production made the most of Riach’s height – he was 6ft 2in – and oddball charisma, as he and Graham threw chairs about an empty stage to create their comic theatrical world. When Donald branched out as a screenwriter, he would write parts specifically with Riach in mind. He cast him as Billy Connolly’s best friend in the BBC drama Deacon Brodie (1997), a bureaucratic butcher in the Channel 4 miniseries Low Winter Sun (2006) and as Ralfi Sigurdson in the Sky Arctic Circle drama Fortitude (2015). Friends recalled Riach as being cheeky, curmudgeonly, stylish, spiky, joyous, opinionated, loyal, coarse and sophisticated. “He had the best put-downs,” said Cumming, who delighted in calling him Grumpy Ralph. “He was someone who said the most awful things to you but you know they’re just ribbing you.” Riach, who never lost his love of sewing from his time as an upholsterer, had a “great gift for stitching us all together”, Redmond said. Whether friends were interested in gardening, cooking, classical music or cryptic crosswords, Riach stitched them into the same tapestry. “There are actors who’ve never met Ralph who know you could phone him at the interval for help with the Guardian crossword,” she added. “He had friends of different kinds but we all knew about each other.” Riach is survived by his son, Drew, and grandchildren, Jen and Tom.

4/2/2022,"At Tuesday evening’s back-slapping dinner for Conservative MPs, Boris Johnson greeted his colleagues with a typical joke, aimed at exploiting Labour’s discomfort over the sensitive issue of gender: “Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Or, as Keir Starmer would put it, people who are assigned female or male at birth,” he quipped. Just hours later, one of those MPs in attendance, Jamie Wallis, issued a heartfelt statement, admitting they were struggling with gender dysphoria. As if trying to atone for his gag, Johnson kicked off prime minister’s questions the following day by hailing Wallis’s bravery. Some Tory strategists had hoped to sit back and watch Labour squirm over “culture war” issues – in particular trans rights. “We don’t really need to do anything,” one senior party figure said gleefully, citing recent interviews in which Starmer appeared to struggle to answer questions about what defines a woman, which they jokingly referred to as “Penisgate”. On Wednesday last week, when the prime minister said in the House of Commons that the “basic facts of biology” are “overwhelmingly important” in defining gender identity, some relieved feminists took to Mumsnet message boards to hail his approach, a fact that did not go unnoticed at CCHQ. Yet Johnson’s U-turn on a U-turn in the space of a few hours on Thursday night over conversion practices underlined the fact that while some in Downing Street may want to fight a “war on woke”, it is not just Labour that is struggling to navigate such sensitive questions. Vocal Tory backbenchers including Dehenna Davison and Alicia Kearns – both from Johnson’s 2019 intake – were quick to make their dismay public, when ITV News were leaked a “handling” document, setting out how the conversion practices ban could be quietly dropped. Davison called it “a matter of basic decency”. The very public row buoyed Labour strategists, who insist the Conservatives are just as divided as Starmer’s party – and put Labour’s recent travails down to a failure to communicate its position properly, rather than an ideological split. Yet the Guardian understands that voters in recent focus groups carried out by Labour have been horrified by the party’s struggle to answer questions such as whether a woman can have a penis. Asked that question in a recent LBC phone-in, Starmer stuttered and stalled. “I’m not … I don’t think we can conduct this debate with … I don’t think that discussing this issue in this way helps anyone in the long run.” Some shadow cabinet members have been privately frustrated at Labour’s caution on such issues. “At the next general election, they will be playing those clips over and over again and we’ll be asked it in every interview,” said one. Particularly among younger shadow cabinet members, there is a feeling that Labour should speak proudly about its progressive values – antiracism, anti-misogyny, pro-trans rights. They argue that by speaking confidently about values, Labour can avoid looking inert and awkward and being led into culture war traps that the Tories will try to set for it. Lisa Nandy, the shadow levelling up secretary, has previously said the US president Joe Biden’s campaign was a model in that regard, pointing out that “he mentioned the trans community in his victory speech, he stood up for the Black Lives Matter protesters, he spoke out about the policing of that movement, and he’s never shied away from standing up for his values”. However, one backbencher suggested there is also a considerable group of “gender critical” Labour MPs – perhaps up to 40 – who are nervous about the potential erosion of sex-based rights. Labour chair Anneliese Dodds dismayed some colleagues when she took a notably cautious approach, when asked by Emma Barnett to define “woman”, in a recent interview with Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. “I think it does depend what the context is, surely,” she said. “I mean, surely that is important here. You know, there are people who have decided that they have to make that transition. I’ve spoken with many of them. It’s been a very difficult process for many of those people. And understandably, because they live as a woman, you know, they want to be defined as a woman. That’s what the Gender Recognition Act … again, a Labour government brought into place.” Privately, some older MPs believe Labour is vulnerable not just on trans rights, but on support for antiracism movements like Black Lives Matter. Fake leaflets, which had the appearance of being official Labour material, were distributed around Batley and Spen during the byelection with a picture of Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner taking the knee. The literature claimed the pair were fighting white privilege. But the issue has also been damaging for the Conservatives, with a huge backlash against Priti Patel for her lack of support for England players taking the knee. Stung by the criticism of a string of recent awkward Labour interviews, the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, and the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, took a noticeably punchier stance this week. Asked about trans rights in an LBC interview, Streeting said: “Men have penises, women have vaginas, here ends my biology lesson,” before going on to say that there are also “people who transition to other genders because they experience gender dysphoria”, and that the debate should be carried out in a “respectful” way. His remarks caused a backlash among some of the LGBT+ activists for whom Streeting had previously been seen as a champion. Political commentator Ellie Mae O’Hagan said, “If it was as simple as men have penises, women have vaginas, then trans people wouldn’t exist. Life is just a bit more complicated than that. Labour is supposed to be a party for the majority, and that means it should be able to deal with the fact that people are different and complicated and they have different paths in life.” However, the Labour leadership believes Streeting’s is a more commonsensical position that respects vulnerable groups, while avoiding being portrayed by the Tories as out of touch with the public. The party’s policy, which includes the protection of single sex spaces in some circumstances, has not changed – but the language has. “I think it’s fair; I think it does what it needs to do,” said a senior Labour strategist. And the strategist added that while the Conservatives may hope to make political capital from “culture war” issues in advance of the next general election, Johnson’s party is deeply divided itself, and risks appearing out of touch with the most pressing issues in voters’ lives. “If you’re worrying about paying your bills at the end of the month, you’re going to think, ‘Why are you talking about this?’”",News/Politics,Gay and trans rights issues divide both Tories and Labour,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/01/gay-and-trans-rights-issues-divide-both-tories-and-labour
4/2/2022,"Yemen could be afflicted by an even worse humanitarian catastrophe if the UK government goes ahead with a plan to designate the Houthi rebels as a terrorist group, leading aid agencies have warned cabinet ministers in a letter. The 11 UK agencies are some of those most active in Yemen, and include Save the Children, Care, the International Rescue Committee and Islamic Relief. In the letter seen by the Guardian, the agencies said: “The likely ‘chilling effect’ on banks and other commercial actors could prove catastrophic for the millions of Yemenis already at risk from hunger, conflict and disease.” The move could result in international banks and companies that import food, medicines and fuel into the country halting some activities out of concern they would unintentionally fall foul of UK terrorism laws. The agencies sent the letter because they were told by Whitehall officials that the home secretary, Priti Patel, in particular was pushing the case for the Houthis to be designated as a terrorist organisation under the Terrorism Act, as part of a review of UK policy in Yemen. The proposal also has the strong support of some Gulf states, especially Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi oil installations and civilian targets have been hit by Houthi missiles, while the UAE was hit by Houthi-fired missiles in January. A parallel debate is under way in Washington. The Gulf states have been left unimpressed by the degree of solidarity shown by the west over what they regard as Iranian backing for the Houthis. The Trump administration first designated Ansar Allah, or the Houthi movement, as a terrorist group for a brief period last year, leading to Yemen’s imports falling by 25%, the agencies said. The decision was reversed by the Biden administration. The agencies wrote: “We are concerned that proscription is a blunt tool that could further worsen already dire economic conditions and cripple the humanitarian response. There are currently no direct provisions within the Terrorism Act (2000) for humanitarian licences or appropriate humanitarian or peace-building exceptions. “Provisions in the act around ‘support’ and ‘funding’ are not clearly defined, making it extremely difficult for NGOs to be assured as to how far they are able to engage with a controlling authority who is a proscribed terrorist organisation. The complexity and lack of clarity increases the likelihood of secondary impacts such as ‘bank de-risking’ leading to an inability to get funds into Yemen.” They continued: “[If] banks were to refuse transfers because of UK proscription, this would likely have a serious impact on remittances, which are a lifeline for 500,000 Yemeni families. Up to one in 10 Yemenis rely on remittances to meet their essential needs. They are the biggest source of foreign exchange into the country, making up 20% of the country’s GDP. More than 100,000 Yemenis living in the UK would no longer be able to support their loved ones. “Grain importers and banks told humanitarian agencies they are unsure if they will be able to continue supplying Yemen if the UK proceeds with proscription of Ansar Allah.” The warning came as the Gulf Cooperation Council launched inter-party talks, which the Houthis have refused to attend partly because the venue is Riyadh, the capital of the forces they have been fighting since 2015. The talks, which are due to conclude on 7 April, have led to a brief ceasefire, a prisoner exchange, and a promise by the Saudi-backed Yemeni government to allow more direct flights into Sana’a airport, as well as to let more oil ships dock at Hodeidah port. The Saudi-led coalition has imposed sea and air restrictions on areas held by the Houthis, who ousted the internationally recognised government in Sana’a in late 2014.",News/World news,"UK plan to label Houthis as terrorists risks disaster in Yemen, aid bodies warn",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/yemen-uk-houthi-rebels-aid-agencies-letter
4/2/2022,"In their boiler suits and stepped hats, looking like employees of a particularly whimsical nuclear power facility, Devo have one of the most distinctive looks in pop – and some of the most distinctive songs. Nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year, they will be joining us to answer your questions. Formed in Ohio in the early 1970s around two sets of brothers – Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh, and Gerald and Bob Casale – the group had been galvanised into action by the horror of the 1970 Kent State massacre of student protesters: “We were pissed off, and we wanted to take the energy that comes from that anger and channel it,” said early member Bob Lewis. What emerged was a band whose absurdist humour and theatricality poked fun at a conformist America that was, per their name, devolving rather than improving. Playing confrontational gigs and making odd, ambitious music videos, they were a cult curiosity until the patronage of David Bowie and Iggy Pop helped them get signed to Warner Bros, with Brian Eno producing their 1978 debut album Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo! Their twitchy, tautly funky cover of the Rolling Stones’ (I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction was even more pent-up than the original, and a performance of it on Saturday Night Live sent them nationwide. Songs such as Jocko Homo and their cover of Johnny Rivers’ Secret Agent Man further grew their popularity, but they truly went overground – without sacrificing any of their surreality – with 1980 single Whip It, a blend of synth-pop and surf-rock which reached the US Top 20. It was the Devo project in glorious miniature: satirising America’s violence, emotional repression and brutal cult of productivity via joyous pop music. The accompanying album Freedom of Choice went platinum and the follow-up New Traditionalists – for which the band all adopted JFK’s hairdo – was a hit. They also appeared in Neil Young’s film oddity Human Highway, though some flop albums and waning popularity later in the decade led them to split in 1991. Frontman Mark Mothersbaugh’s sparky sense of humour helped him segue into music for children’s shows such as Rugrats, then film scores for Wes Anderson (Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), and even dipped into the Marvel universe with his score for Thor: Ragnarok (featuring such orchestral works as Devil’s Anus). Devo re-formed for concerts in 1996 and have frequently toured in the years since, and released one further album, 2010’s Something for Everybody. In May, the band are hoping it’s third time lucky after two previous nominations for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Mark Mothersbaugh and founding bassist Gerald Casale – who have strongly condemned Putin’s actions in Ukraine and are donating next month’s Devo royalties to humanitarian charities working in the country – are joining us to answer your questions about their madcap career.

4/2/2022,"Covid cases have hit an all-time high in England just as free testing kits for the public came to an end. This strange juxtaposition, combined with the lack of rules on masks and vague guidance on self-isolating, has left some wondering how to navigate the latest wave of infections. The official end of free testing kits (although they have been hard to come by for some time) means people under 75 and not shielding have to pay about £2 a test from a chemist or supermarket. There is no legal requirement to test, but given that Covid symptoms overlap with seasonal respiratory infections and hay fever, without testing there is no clear way to know if you’re infected. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, suggests taking a test, if possible, if you have symptoms. “I’d partly do this because once I’ve had it, I’ll be more comfortable about my risk going forward,” he said. While for most individuals Covid is now less of a risk than seasonal flu, this is not the case for everybody – older people and those who are immunocompromised remain at particular risk. This is especially the case for those who had their last vaccine dose six months ago and are now due a booster. So testing before meeting indoors with people who may be at greater risk is worth considering – especially until the next rollout of booster doses. For children, the advice is that testing is not recommended unless you are directed to do so by a health professional. Masks are no longer mandatory, but there is evidence that they reduce transmission in crowded indoor spaces and when in prolonged proximity to others, such as on public transport. The extra layer of protection also means that if you are exposed to Covid, you are likely to receive a lower dose of the virus, which could reduce the severity of symptoms you experience if infected. “The evidence for this isn’t cast-iron, but it’s likely to be the case,” said Hunter. For many, there is also an element of etiquette. “If I go into a shop and it’s crowded I’ll put on a face covering,” said Hunter. “If it’s not really crowded but lots of other people are wearing masks, I’ll still put one on as a courtesy. I don’t want to make people feel uncomfortable and there will be people who will feel they have to carry on wearing masks to be safer.” There is no longer a legal requirement for people to test or self-isolate, but if you have any of the main symptoms or a positive test result, the public health advice is to stay at home, avoid contact with other people and to try to work from home. For children, the advice is that those with mild symptoms (runny nose, slight cough) can continue to attend school, but those who have a temperature or are feeling unwell should stay at home until they feel better. The requirement to self-isolate for five full days (previously 10 days) has been replaced with advice to avoid others “until you no longer have a high temperature (if you had one) or until you no longer feel unwell”. Hunter says this is broadly sensible since people tend to be at their most infectious in the early stage of infection and while symptomatic. “I’d isolate as long as I was quite ill,” he said. “If I wasn’t that ill, I’d expect three to five days or until I was well on the way to getting over it before I’d go back into society.” However the advice becomes a bit stricter for those who actually confirm infection with a test. In this case the guidance is to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days after the day you took your test, or three days for children. “It’s worth remembering that we’re only picking up about one in eight infections through testing,” Hunter adds. “Whatever I do, there are seven other people wandering around with no clue that they’ve got Covid so even isolating everybody who knows they are positive isn’t going to make a massive difference.” Those who want to really minimise their risk of infecting others could stick with the previous guidance of ending isolation on the back of two consecutive negative tests starting from day five and six. After day 10, it is possible that lateral flow tests will continue to show a positive result, but the chances of still being infectious are extremely low. The government now gives a list of symptoms of “Covid-19, flu and common respiratory infections” rather than attempting a specific list for coronavirus. At the top of the list are a continuous cough, high temperature and loss of, or change in, sense of taste or smell. However, the latest data from the Zoe app suggests the most common current symptom for those with Covid is a runny nose (reported by eight out of 10 people), followed by fatigue, a sore throat, headache and sneezing. Far fewer people are reporting an altered sense of taste or smell in the latest wave.",News/World news,How to navigate Covid etiquette now England has ended free testing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/01/how-to-navigate-covid-now-england-has-ended-universal-free-testing
