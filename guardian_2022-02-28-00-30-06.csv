2/28/2022,"Saturday Night Live returns from a three-week hiatus to find the world very much changed in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. With the war still in its early days, people aren’t in much of a laughing mood, let alone ready to see the show attempt to mine it for comedy (even if you don’t think satirists should blink in the face of fresh tragedy, it’s been clear for years that SNL in its current state is simply not up to that task). Thankfully, the show doesn’t even try to use the war for fodder, opting instead to hand the cold open over to the Ukrainian Choir Dumka of New York, who perform Prayer for Ukraine. Their moving performance is weighted with sadness, but also strength and resolve. SNL hasn’t always succeeded when taking the somber approach – see the cold opens that followed 9/11 or Trump’s election for examples of how bad they can be – but in this case, they 100% made the right call. Comedian and former show writer John Mulaney hosts for the fifth time. Mulaney has had a dramatic year, which he dives right into in his monologue. He talks about the intervention his friends held for him (“Do you know how bad of a drug problem you have to have if when you open a door and see people gathered, your first thought is ‘this is probably an intervention for my drug problem’?”), his stint in rehab (“I was there for the insurrection … wouldn’t have happened on my watch … they know Baby J is back on the streets!”), his confusing relationship with his former drug dealer (“There are many tales of drug dealers who have turned innocent people into drug addicts … I might be the first drug addict to turn an innocent man into a drug dealer”), and his newborn son (“He’s a pretty cool guy for someone who can’t vote”). Not only is it great to see Mulaney happy and healthy, it’s also very encouraging to find him willing to mine his struggles so unsentimentally and hilariously. Things get underway with a courtroom sketch in which a plaintiff (Melissa Villaseñor) is suing her neighbor after his pet monkey mauled her. Unfortunately for her, the case pulls “monkey judge” Tango (Mulaney in full monkey get-up), recently appointed by “that crackpot governor who loved pranks and struggled with addiction”. Mulaney plays things completely straight, speaking fluent legalese, even as he behaves according to animal nature. With a lesser performer at its center, this might have been a train wreck, but in Mulaney’s able hands (or monkey paws, in this case), it hits the sweet spot between hilariously clever and enjoyably stupid, not unlike the late Phil Hartman’s beloved Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer sketches from the ’90s. A commercial for Blue River Dog Food – made with real ingredients – sees a couple (Cecily Strong and Mulaney) furiously harangue an acquaintance who they see buying a different brand in the pet store. It’s a solid (if very late) follow up to the even more deranged Blue River Dog Food ad from 2014. Another of the recurring Careful sketches, a dinner date between three couples takes a series of awkward, tense and overly dramatic turns after members of the party bring up “incredibly complicated and emotional” topics such as the effectiveness of masking mandates, vaccines, Covid tests and outdoor dining. Whatever valid points the sketch may make about the failures in the government and scientific community’s response to Covid play as hypocritical coming from this show, seeing how much it did to add to narrative (Hot Dr Fauci, anyone?). A new Please Don’t Destroy video is also centered around Covid, with Ben, Martin and John initially dismayed at hearing the news of a new variant. But things take a turn for the better when they discover the new strain “mutated so hard it’s actually good”. The Delvini Variant doesn’t make you sick, it just makes you party extra hard. Together with Paul Rudd, Al Roker and some real-life Pokémon, they party long into the night. Rudd sticks around for the next sketch, kicking back in the Five-Timers clubhouse with fellow five-time hosts Candice Bergen, Steve Martin, Tina Fey, Conan O’Brien and, best of all, “Chest Hair Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive” Elliott Gould. Together, they reluctantly welcome Mulaney into the club, even though it gets less exclusive and “not special” with each new member admitted. The star power on display would be enough to make this the standout segment of the night, but luckily, it doesn’t just coast on its cameos. Every person gets at least one or two killer lines and moments – Mulaney telling Bergen: “You wouldn’t know me, but if you have a niece or a son who’s bad at sports, they might”; Martin denying he’s at retirement age because “I have the child of a 38-year-old”; Fey claiming to be the first woman to ever wear glasses on TV (“Entertainment Weekly called it ‘disgusting’”), and a perfectly self-deprecating O’Brien signing off with “Live from New York, it’s Saturday Night!” despite it being the middle of the episode. On a noticeably truncated Weekend Update, Colin Jost and Michael Che address the invasion of Ukraine head-on. Jost notes that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, “launched the attack with support from allies like Belarus and Tucker Carlson”, while Che reports his close Russian friend’s take on the situation: “Michael, you no pay me to talk baby.” Eventually, they move on to other topics, including President Biden’s historic nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the supreme court (“Weird, I thought interviewing black candidates was just for show, says the NFL”), Buckingham Palace staff’s mocking of Prince Andrew by singing nursery rhymes in his presence (“Said Prince Andrew, “Ooooh, nursery!”), and the FDA’s approval of a condom for anal sex (“It took them this long because their wives would only let them test it on their birthdays”). This is followed by the much-anticipated Broadway sketch that comes with every new Mulaney episode. This time, the action takes place in the underground hellhole that is New York’s 34 Street-Herald Square subway station. Songs from Fiddler on the Roof, South Pacific, The Music Man and more get twisted into numbers about mole men, bath salt breakdowns, and the various dangers found on the F-train. Particularly funny are a trench-coat wearing pervert’s rendition of Fapping on the Train (née Singing in the Rain) and Kyle Mooney’s short appearance as Dear Evan Hansen. The big showstopper is an unhinged take on Jesus Christ Superstar featuring LCD Soundsystem as vigilante clowns The Guardian Angels. Behind the Slime is “look back at Nickelodeon’s iconic green goo”, hosted by former network stars Nick stars Nick Cannon (Chris Redd) and Marc Summers (Alex Moffat). They play clips from ‘0s, all of which feature now incredibly un-PC jokes and dangerous early prototypes of the slime. The clip in which Mulaney and Sarah Sherman’s kid actors get utterly decimated by violent blasts of the stuff is particularly funny, in large part because Mulaney’s shocked reaction of “Jesus Christ!” feels real. Mulaney (once again) the plays Ego Nowdim’s seemingly square, but surprisingly hip boyfriend. Accompanying her to her family reunion, he shows off some killer dance moves, a deep knowledge of Atlanta hip-hop, and an easy rapport with the black community. This is basically a redo of the Cha-Chad Slide sketch from 2019, but the short interaction between him and Nwodim’s skeptical uncle about the Covid vaccine – “I got vaxed too,” he tells the old timer, “but it would break my momma’s heart if she knew I took a government needle,” – justifies its existence. The return to several familiar wells aside, this was an excellent episode. Mulaney’s return was reason enough to celebrate, but the quality of the writing and sheer star wattage of the Five Timers club sketch put it over the top. The wise decision not to focus on dire world events (minus some brief mentions on Update) also made it a much-needed respite – for those of us lucky enough to enjoy such a thing – from bleak reality.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: John Mulaney’s entertaining arrival to the five-timers club,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/27/saturday-night-live-john-mulaney-ukraine-tribute
2/28/2022,"Liz Hyder sold the film rights to her YA debut, Bearmouth, a dystopian thriller about child miners fighting injustice, before it had arrived in the bookshops. In The Gifts, a Victorian novel for adults, four feisty women struggle against the constraints of a patriarchal society. When two of them grow wings, they are exploited by a ruthless surgeon, Edward Meake, who believes he is serving science and God’s purpose. Etta, inspired by the real-life Mary McGhie from Ludlow, is the daughter of a freed slave and a former plantation owner. After their father’s death her stepbrother banishes her from the family house and she resides in the keeper’s cottage with her beloved dog, Scout. A budding botanist, Etta spends her days tramping over the Shropshire countryside classifying and sketching plants. Natalya, another outcast, is a mesmerising storyteller. She travels from Orkney to London hoping for a new start. Separately, the two women undergo a strange epiphany and sprout wings. There is little explanation for their transformation except their shared belief that their gift is related to a deep connection to the land and “the wildness within us”. Mary lives with her Uncle Jos and demonstrates a talent for writing and sniffing out a good news story. Annie (the least rounded of the female characters) is Edward’s wife and a gifted artist. As the women strive for autonomy, we follow their fates over the course of one month. Their paths finally converge in Meake’s dissecting room. The surgeon has imprisoned Etta and Natalya, convinced they are “gifts” from God. It’s a stirring tale of female empowerment, full of vivid imagery and evocative settings. The repetitive prose could, however, have been pared back and Hyder’s descriptions are sometimes hackneyed. She crams in a lot of detail and a multitude of voices. The episodic structure gives the novel pace but dilutes tension. Nevertheless, The Gifts’ scope is impressive and it’s sure to win Hyder new fans and, quite possibly, another film deal.

2/28/2022,"Eighteen years after its predecessor, and five years after Roland Orzabal first announced it, the seventh Tears for Fears album (and the second with Curt Smith back on board) is finally upon us. Its gestation has been far from smooth: Orzabal’s first wife died in 2017 and he suffered a bout of ill health immediately afterwards. Meanwhile the band’s former management were discouraging them from making a record at all (as detailed in the lyrics of the sarcastic Master Plan). So The Tipping Point’s very existence is a triumph of sorts. All that time spent working on these songs is apparent: the arrangements are unfailingly lush, the musicianship beyond criticism. And there are plenty of moments to savour here: My Demons throbs in a manner that’s improbably reminiscent of Goldfrapp circa Supernature, thanks to new collaborator Sacha Skarbek’s synths; the title track unflinchingly recalls Orzabal’s bereavement; the uptempo End of Night is as uplifting as songs about the Mistral are likely to get. But while it all sounds impeccably polished, it lacks the sort of killer hook that used to consistently elevate them above their mid-80s peers. The end result finds elegance trumping excitement.",Arts/Music,"Tears for Fears: The Tipping Point review – an elegant, long-awaited return",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/27/tears-for-fears-the-tipping-point-review
2/28/2022,"When Boris Johnson chose to build a cable car linking two of the lesser frequented spots of east London dockland, eyebrows were raised. After the then mayor’s pet project opened in time for the 2012 Olympics, the controversial sale of naming rights to the new Emirates Air Line at least stemmed the losses. Now, though, that lucrative deal is about to run out – and no sponsor can be found to step in, even at a fraction of the price. However, with the cash-strapped capital reliant on emergency government support to run its tubes and buses since Covid struck, Transport for London (TfL) bosses have been left under no illusions that now is not the time to ditch the prime minister’s unwanted cable car. Commercial teams at TfL last year sent invitations far and wide to find a sponsor successor to Emirates, hoping for less than a quarter of the £3.6m a year paid by the cash-rich Gulf airline over the last decade. But not one company – not even the payday loan firms represented by agencies – took the cut-price opportunity to associate its brand with the service linking Greenwich Peninsula to the Royal Victoria Dock, 1,100 metres away. Last week, after a deadline for submissions passed on Tuesday without a single expression of interest, TfL formally ended the search for a sponsor, leaving a potential multimillion drain on the capital. According to a well-placed source, senior TfL executives messaged last week: “Storm Eunice was our last hope.” Unfortunately for TfL, while the high winds tore a hole in the nearby Millennium Dome, the cable car was left unscathed. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, has been forced to raise bus and tube fares, and TfL has been ordered to make £400m cost savings and raise revenues by central government, as part of a series of funding settlements, including a £200m short-term deal agreed on Friday. Nonetheless, the “dangleway” is set to survive, at least as long as Khan’s predecessor survives in Downing Street. Johnson argued that the Emirates Air Line, which cost about £60m to construct, would create thousands of jobs and be a valuable addition to the transport network. At one point, however, it was revealed to be used by only four regular commuters, freedom of information requests showed. Many tourists have since Instagrammed their trip and more than 13m journeys have been taken over its lifetime – roughly the same number of journeys made in three normal days on the tube. Emirates Air Line briefly appeared to have an important transport function when it offered free travel to key workers who needed to reach the Nightingale hospital, based at ExCeL London, at the start of the pandemic in 2020, although the hospital was mothballed for lack of use. It will have fresh patrons ahead, as London’s parlous finances have forced the mayor to move City Hall itself, which isbeing relocated from beside Tower Bridge to the Crystal development near the cable car’s east terminal. The Department for Transport said any decision on the future of the cable car was for the mayor to take. TfL said it would look to “other market engagement methods” to find a sponsor. Josh Crompton, TfL’s head of cable car, said: “We know our customers love the unique experience and the spectacular views the cable car offers … We remain committed to building on the success of the cable car with a new partner later this year.”",News/UK news,Boris Johnson’s Emirates Air Line cable car fails to find new sponsor,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/27/london-cut-price-hunt-for-a-cable-car-sponsor-emirates-boris-johnson
2/28/2022,"Germany, Italy and France have become the latest European countries to ban Russia’s aircraft from their airspace, forcing the country’s passenger planes to take increasingly circuitous routes to their destinations. The Italian prime minister’s office said it had decided to close its airspace to Russian aircraft, the German transport ministry put in place similar restrictions for three months, and France’s minister for transport, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, announced a ban that would come into force from Sunday evening. They join a long list of countries across the continent that have announced similar closures following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, including the UK, Ireland, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. On Sunday morning, Finland followed suit, while the Baltic states – Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia – have already taken the step to close their airspace to Russian planes, severely limiting Russia’s options for routes taken by its west-bound flights. Lithuanian airspace usually provides Russia with the shortest flight to its Kaliningrad exclave – a small parcel of land next to the Baltic Sea between Lithuania and Poland – which has no common border with Russia. More countries are expected to announce Russian air traffic restrictions in the coming days, with Norway, Sweden, Austria, Denmark and Netherlands discussing bans. The route of flight SU2500, operated by the Russian national airline, Aeroflot, from Moscow to Madrid on Sunday morning illustrated the changes to flight routing already necessary before the German and Italian moves were announced. The flight tracker website FlightRadar24 showed the Airbus A321 jet flew north-west across Russia to the Baltic Sea coast, which it crossed to reach Germany’s northern coast, before travelling across Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France and finally Spain. This is the ridiculous route an Aeroflot flight from Moscow to Madrid now has to take. Once the German ban comes into force it will be even worse. And that's an A321, spare parts for which can't be exported to Russia. I wouldn't want to fly on it. pic.twitter.com/s5ttjFvWYk FlightRadar24 showed an Aeroflot flight travelling on Sunday from Moscow to Athens took a similar route before dipping south, skirting the coast of Italy before finally reaching the Greek capital. A more much direct journey would have taken an aircraft over Ukraine and the Black Sea. The airspace closures are redrawing the route map for Russian jets, resulting in longer journeys, which use significantly more fuel and cost more for the airlines to operate, at a time when Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine has pushed oil prices higher. The situation will become far more challenging for Russia now that Germany has closed its airspace, almost completely blocking most flightpaths to the west. The German flag carrier, Lufthansa, had already cancelled all of its flights to Russia for the coming week. Russia has banned all British aircraft from landing in the country in retaliation over Boris Johnson’s decision to ban Aeroflot from landing in the UK. “The immediate impact is on flights between Russia and other countries around Europe, the bigger issue is whether Russian airspace is closed off,” said the aviation consultant John Strickland, of JLS Consulting. “This would have an impact on other countries’ airlines, from the UK and EU states, who would ordinarily use Russian airspace to fly to many destinations in Asia. That means more indirect routings and flying for significantly longer.” He added: “We don’t know how long this might last for. Airline management teams will be racking their brains right now and thinking about contingency plans.” The measures come just as international air travel is beginning to return following the pandemic, although there are fewer passenger flights between Europe and Asia, as many countries, such as China and Japan, remain mostly closed to foreign visitors. However, the route changes are also expected to affect the transport of cargo. Sections of international airspace have been closed off in recent years – including during the Gulf war and when US airspace was shut in the days following the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 – but rarely have so many countries banned another from their airspace. Parts of Ukrainian airspace were avoided by international airlines from July 2014, after Malaysia Airlines MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down, leading to the deaths of all 298 people onboard. International investigators say the Boeing 777 was brought down by a Russian-made missile fired from territory in eastern Ukraine held by pro-Russia rebels, but Moscow has denied involvement. If Russia decided to shut out international flights from its airspace, the move would have a significant impact on the country’s finances. “Russia makes a lot of foreign exchange for charging for overflight rights, the use of airspace and navigation, and it is a substantial amount,” Strickland said.",News/World news,"Germany, Italy and France join airspace ban on Russian aircraft",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/germany-and-italy-are-latest-to-ban-russian-aircraft-from-airspace
2/28/2022,"Caroline Weir was on the scoresheet for the fourth time against Manchester United as Manchester City withstood a plucky first half from the home team to progress to the quarter-finals of the FA Cup with a 4-1 win away from home. United midfielder Katie Zelem gave United a first-half lead before City manager Gareth Taylor’s half time substitutions swung the momentum of the increasingly feisty tie, and goals in the second half from Lauren Hemp, Ellen White, Weir and Khadija ‘Bunny’ Shaw sealed the win. In City’s 1-0 defeat of United at a sold-out Academy Stadium in the Women’s Super League before the international break United had stuttered. The rhythm that Marc Skinner’s side had found in the new year and the swaggering attacking movement that was born from it, was gone. Instead, it was City that nipped at the heels of the visiting team, their experience in high-pressure games, contrasting starkly with the rabbit-in-the-headlights hesitancy of the four-year-old refounded United, carrying them through a fixture that could have all but ended their hopes of Champions League football. “I would agree that they won a few more of those second balls,” said Skinner after that game. “One of my reflections is we need to be way more aggressive in those one-v-one duels and those challenges.” If Skinner was demanding more aggression from his players here then he got it. In the sun at Leigh Sports Village United were the disruptors, harrying and pressing the City side that has not failed to reach an FA Cup quarter-final since the team was relaunched into the WSL in 2014, and playing with a dynamism up top that was far more characteristic of their youthful attack. In the 14th minute they were rewarded for their efforts, as Zelem’s corner looped in at the far post, with goalkeeper Ellie Roebuck nowhere near it. United would continue to eke out more chances in the first half, with forward Martha Thomas making space on the edge of the box before lashing straight at Roebuck and City centre-back Alex Greenwood doing well to block a shot that followed full-back Hannah Blundell’s sweeping run and cross from the left. Perturbed, Taylor took off Vicky Losada and Jess Park for Australian Haley Raso and Scotland’s Weir at the break. The impact was instant, with Weir, who has scored in each of her last three home matches against Manchester United, meeting a cross at the back post that was gathered by goalkeeper Mary Earps. It would be Raso, though, that would help City draw level five minutes after the break, with her clipped cross from the right towards White miskicked by the forward into the path of Hemp who placed the ball coolly beyond Earps. As in the preceding meeting of these two teams, with the pressure on, City flourished while United wilted. Nine minutes later the visiting team took the lead with United full-back Ona Batlle at fault, heading the ball straight into the run of White, wearing yellow tape around her captain’s armband to turn it into the Ukraine flag, who calmly rounded Earps and slotted home. Delivering the sucker punch two minutes later was a familiar face. A diagonal ball over the top to Hemp was cut back to Weir, who scored the winner two weeks ago, and the forward squeezed the ball between the post and Earps, who should have done better. Shaw would add a fourth with her first touch and again Earps should have done better, parrying Hemp’s shot straight into the path of the Jamaican forward who smashed the ball into the roof of the net from two yards out.

2/28/2022,"The story Boris Johnson and his colleagues now tell us about Vladimir Putin and his regime is simple enough. The Russian president, Johnson says, is “a bloodstained aggressor who believes in imperial conquest”; he has violated “every principle of civilised behaviour between states”. What is happening in Ukraine, moreover, reminds us of the cruel, amoral way that Putin governs his own country, and its contrast with the ideas that unite the west. The world, it is said, is once again polarising between dictatorship and freedom – and in cooperation with its allies, the government has proudly entered what one Tory MP recently described as a global “battle for democracy”. Johnson, indeed, sees himself as leading the charge, repeating the mantra that “Putin must fail”, and claiming that Britain is “out in front”.All this might seem welcome, but it is also rather absurd. For a long time now, the Conservative party has been happily backsliding on its commitment to liberal values, and dismantling some of the basic structures of political scrutiny and accountability. Brexit, the reckless project that put Britain on the periphery of Europe and brought Johnson to power, was a huge blow to exactly the kind of multilateralism the prime minister now affects to believe in. As further proof of the ethical vacuum at the heart of Tory politics, Conservative politicians have been happily accepting Russian money while averting their eyes from the Putin regime’s meddling in British politics. Now, though, all of that must suddenly be forgotten: the din of bombs and guns has suddenly awakened the Tory conscience, and the prime minister will soon be telling us that huge hikes in the cost of petrol, gas and food are the price to be paid for values he himself seems to scarcely believe in. When Johnson bemoans “the Kremlin’s blizzard of lies and disinformation”, the gaff is blown. Clearly, he is no Putin, but that is not quite the point. His time in power, let us not forget, has seen not just serial mendacity, but the unlawful suspension of parliament, attacks on the courts, plans for clampdowns on the right to protest – and, via the government’s cynical insistence that voting will depend on presenting photo ID, new restrictions on our most basic democratic rights. The games the government has played with the Northern Ireland protocol don’t exactly suggest a deep attachment to international rules. And the impression that the BBC is now being victimised for not being as obedient as the government would like has the same whiff of the worst kind of power politics, along with ministers’ seemingly endless “war on woke” and the introverted nastiness of Priti Patel’s Home Office (highlighted on Saturday, when an immigration minister apparently suggested that Ukrainian refugees could attempt to come to Britain using the government’s seasonal workers’ scheme). When it comes to a very modern mixture of reactionary politics and disregard for democratic norms, there is a continuum that ends with Putin and also takes in such figures as Donald Trump and Hungary’s Viktor Orbán; and Johnson is definitely on there somewhere. Even if he’s an opportunist rather than an ethno-nationalist, that’s still some indictment. There is a particularly glaring example of the Conservatives’ current moral contortions: the estimated £2m in Russia-linked donations that have come the Tories’ way since Johnson became prime minister. An exemplary benefactor is Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of Putin’s former deputy finance minister Vladimir Chernukhin (Pandora papers documents published in October last year suggest he was allowed to leave Russia in 2004 with assets worth about £350m and retain Russian business links). She is now a member of the Conservatives’ 14-strong “advisory board” of donors, with a habit of handing the party six-figure sums. In 2020, Electoral Commission records showed that six members of the cabinet and eight junior ministers had taken money from individuals or businesses linked to Russia. If senior Tories now insist that such donors are often opposed to the Putin regime, and all is therefore well, that is not convincing: as anyone who knows about modern Russia will tell you, retaining significant business interests, connections or assets in Russia entails obligations to Putin, and relationships with a state that constantly seeks information, intelligence and foreign influence. Any political party with the most basic grasp of national security should surely know that. Clearly, unease about Tory donations dovetails into serious questions about the government’s lamentable record on Russian interference in our politics. When the findings of the parliamentary intelligence and security committee’s long-suppressed, heavily redacted inquiry into that subject (aka the Russia report) were finally published, in the summer of 2020, they prompted loud noise about the lack of attention the government paid to evidence of Russian meddling in UK elections and referendums – but Johnson pathetically batted away such worries as the neuroses of “Islingtonian remainers”. From the members of the House of Lords with Russian business interests to London’s so-called laundromat for dirty Russian money, other issues that the Ukraine crisis has once again pushed into the political foreground were also laid bare. But what followed was even more of the same inaction that the report bemoaned, which is one of the reasons why Johnson’s sudden scramble to look resolute and tough looks so desperate. Meanwhile, elsewhere on the political right, there is something even more awful: the meek apologism for Putin seen lately in the endless excuses for the Ukraine invasion proffered by Nigel Farage – who moronically reduces Ukraine’s plight to the consequences of Nato and the EU “poking the Russian bear with a stick” – and the Brexit-backing millionaire Arron Banks, who once compared Crimea’s relationship with Russia to the Isle of Wight’s with Britain. It would be comforting to think that their views are confined to the same political fringes as comparable ideas on the hard left, but the context is markedly different: these, after all, are people who played a crucial role in our exit from the EU, and have strong ​support in the rightwing press (and, for what it’s worth, the TV channel GB News). They are also the figureheads of a strand of rightwing politics that blurs out not just into Toryism but parts of English society characterised by money and power, where the influence of what the Russia report called “a lot of Russians with very close links to Putin” is increasingly clear. Here, in fact, lies another reminder of links that connect pro-Kremlin voices with the City, the London property industry, high-end private schools, and conservative politics with both a large and small C. What a mess all this is, but what a clear alternative it demands: politicians and public figures whose attachment to our fragile, damaged liberal values is just as fervent as the belief in democracy and the rule of law that evidently runs deep among so many of the Ukrainians – and Russians – who are currently in such a desperate situation. In the absence of such authentic voices, all the government’s sound and fury threatens to amount to a flimsy and cynical performance – no basis for leading us through the economic turbulence this crisis is already creating; and, worse still, something that Putin may well interpret as a sign that things will once again align in his favour.
