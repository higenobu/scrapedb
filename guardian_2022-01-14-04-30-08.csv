1/14/2022,"That’s a useful New Year resolution from Asos: stop hanging around with the small fry on the junior Alternative Investment Market (Aim) and get a premium listing on London’s main market. It shows a certain seriousness, which is the least shareholders deserve after Asos’ rotten 2021, which was capped with a thumping profits warning last October. Promotion will happen by the end of next month and the mystery is why it wasn’t sought earlier in 20 years as a listed company. During the high points for its share price, remember, Asos was worth as much as £5bn, which is borderline FTSE 100 territory. The arguments offered in favour on Thursday – boosting the corporate profile and widening the pool of potential investors – could have been made for about a decade.  The presence of a 25% shareholder in the form of Bestseller, the fashion group controlled by Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, may have been a factor in delay. Or perhaps management didn’t fancy the princely legal fees involved in making the switch. Tough: sometimes you have to pay through the nose anyway. There’s no guarantee that main market status will make Asos’ share price any less volatile (the market capitalisation is £2.25bn these days) but two points are worth making. First, the timing is good in the sense that the latest trading update produced no fresh bad news – the shares rose 10%. Second, the move will “set the cat amongst the pigeons at Boohoo HQ”, as independent retail analyst Nick Bubb put it. Well, quite. Boohoo would struggle to get off the Aim market as long as co-founder and 12.5% owner Mahmud Kamani insists on being executive chairman, even after the saga of the initially mishandled crisis in 2020 over pay and working conditions in its Leicester factories. Asos, by contrast, is the one that didn’t get into a similar scrape and runs a broadly conventional governance setup (Ian Dyson, ex M&S finance director, has just taken over as non-executive chairman from BT-bound Adam Crozier). At a moment when investors are wondering about post-lockdown cracks in the pure internet retailing model, there is no harm at all in Asos emphasising its differences. It ought to be hard for a housebuilder not to enjoy today’s bubbly conditions in the property market, but Countryside Properties has managed it: the first quarter targets were missed by a country mile. Operating profit more than halved – from £36.6m to £16.5m. Chief executive Iain McPherson, inevitably, has gone with immediate effect. But shareholders in the FTSE 250 firm are still left to wonder what, precisely, has gone wrong. Chair John Martin, the ex-Ferguson boss who will pick up McPherson’s trowel until a new chief executive is found, mentioned issues of “operational execution”, but he’ll only offer a fuller account once he’s been through the business on a site-by-site basis, which he says could take ten weeks. That’s a long time to wait and fret about the size of the damage to a forecast, made only seven weeks ago, of operating profits of £200m-£210m in the financial year that ends in September. The 21% plunge in the share price betrays the uncertainty over whether this is a case of a single bad quarter or something worse. Either way, Countryside’s ra-ra rhetoric in November about “the compelling opportunity that is ahead of us”, as the company focuses entirely on local authority and housing association schemes, may need a rewrite. The good news, of a sort, is that only £60m from a £450m share buy-back programme launched last July has been squandered at out-of-date prices. But it’s not much consolation until Martin reveals the size of the repair job. Profit upgrades are clearly baked into expectations at retailers. Marks & Spencer didn’t budge on its £500m forecast for this financial year, merely strengthening its language from November’s “in the region of” to “at least”, and was rewarded with an 8% fall in its share price. Never mind, the stock is still up 70% in 12 months. Indeed, long-term investors may care more about a striking figure in the update: full-price sales in the clothing and home department rose by 45% in the last 13 weeks of 2021 versus two years ago. If that represents clinching evidence that M&S has definitively kicked its addiction to panicky “friends and family” promotions, a minor miracle has occurred. With its food side going gangbusters, M&S looks healthy – finally.",News/Business,Asos advances to a premium listing on London’s main market – at last,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/13/asos-advances-to-a-premium-listing-on-londons-main-market-at-last
1/14/2022,"Over 8,000 workers at nearly 80 Kroger-owned King Soopers grocery stores around Colorado started a three week strike on Wednesday as new union contract negotiations stalled. The dispute is the latest in which workers have accused a corporation of making big profits during the pandemic while not paying high enough wages.  Kenny Sanchez, a King Soopers worker in Broomfield, Colorado for ten years has attended new contract negotiation meetings with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7 union and Kroger – and said there was a gulf between the two sides. Sanchez said the lawyers from out of state acting on behalf of Kroger don’t get that the cost of living in Colorado has been soaring, and the workers’ wages aren’t keeping up with it. “We’re not making a living wage. We have people living out of their cars and struggling to pay bills,” said Sanchez. “This company does not get it. We can’t survive on what they’re paying out here and the competition is paying more.” A nearly unanimous percentage of union membership voted to authorize the strike over unfair labor practices against Kroger, as the company’s last, best, and final offer included several concessions such as permitting the company to lower wages, use non-union gig workers, shortening leave of absence periods, relying on a part-time workforce, and offering only a $0.13 wage increase for some workers. Workers have pushed for a $6 an hour wage increase for all employees, while the final proposal only included wage increases up to $4.50 an hour based on job classification and tenure, with a $16 an hour floor, just $0.13 higher than minimum wage in Denver. “A pay raise is nice, but if you’re forking out a bunch more for health insurance, then there is no raise. That’s why it’s a crooked deal,” added Sanchez. “Healthcare costs around the country have been going up and we need the company to put a little extra money into our health insurance to keep it affordable.” Kim Cordova, president of UFCW Local 7, said the unfair labor practice charges the union filed against Kroger included refusal to furnish information necessary for bargaining over issues such as safety, and the company directly contacting workers and threatening to discipline or send home workers from wearing anything that identifies them as a union supporter. “The strike is over unfair labor practices, but we’re far apart over the issues of negotiations,” said Cordova. “The CEO was bragging to the shareholders on Wall Street about how well Kroger has done during the pandemic while restaurants and businesses were shut down. They thrived, they made record profits, their investors were the recipients of about a billion and a half dollars in stock buybacks and then they come to the bargaining table and say, ‘we can’t afford it.’” Kroger has also brought in outside workers and hired temporary staff to continue operations during the strike, while King Soopers had already been operating with 2,400 fewer employees than normal due to attrition. “It’s an insult. Our workers are paid $16 an hour to start with or less. Then they offered to pay temporary workers $18 to do our jobs that we’ve been doing, and they expected us to train temporary workers to do our jobs for less money,” said Carol McMillan, a King Soopers worker in Aurora, Colorado for seven years. She explained that through the pandemic, grocery workers have faced staffing shortages, long hours, and been treated poorly by employers and customers. “In the beginning of the pandemic we were heroes and then we were kind of forgotten,” she added. “We just need them to recognize that without us they can’t run their stores.” A survey of over 10,000 Kroger workers in California, Washington, and Colorado published on 11 January by the Economic Roundtable found 14% of Kroger workers experienced homelessness in the past year. Food insecurity among workers surveyed was rampant, as 34% reported skipping or reducing meals because they couldn’t afford food and 14% of workers rely on SNAP assistance. 34 percent of Kroger workers reported skipping or reducing meals because they couldn't afford food. 14 percent of workers reported relying on SNAP assistance pic.twitter.com/UUrw5xYdBQ Kroger, the largest supermarket chain in the US, have seen profits and sales soar through the pandemic. The company reported a profit of $2.6bn in 2020 and the Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen received a wage increase of 45% to $20.6m. The company authorized another $1bn toward stock buybacks at the end of 2021, after repurchasing $1bn in stocks through the first three quarters of 2021. In their latest quarterly earnings, Kroger reported an increase of 7.2% in sales compared to 2020, and saw sales increase 1.3% over the first two quarters of 2021. A Brookings Institution analysis published in December 2021 found Kroger raised average wages from $15 an hour in January 2020 to $16.25 an hour in October 2021, but with recent inflation rates the wage gain equates to just $0.17 cents an hour. In a press release, Kroger-owned King Soopers and City Market president Joe Kelley criticized the strike and filed unfair labor practice claims against the union after the union had filed unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board. “It’s time for Kim Cordova to put our associates, her members, first instead of denying them the opportunity to vote on this unprecedented investment. Creating more disruption for our associates, their families, and Coloradans rather than negotiating for a peaceful resolution is irresponsible and undemocratic,” Kelley said.",News/Environment,"‘We have people living out of their cars’: 8,000 Kroger workers strike over wages",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/13/kroger-workers-strike-over-wages
1/14/2022,"Reality has finally caught up with Prince Andrew. His attempt to stop Virginia Giuffre from pursuing her civil damages claim against him was thrown out by a New York judge on Wednesday. Judge Lewis Kaplan’s decision meant that the case would go ahead and there was thus no good option for the Queen’s son. On Thursday, Buckingham Palace moved decisively to cut the prince loose, stripping him of his military titles, his royal patronages and his use of His Royal Highness. For the prince, it was a day of disgrace. It has been too long coming. The Giuffre case is not just a private matter. It showcases big public interest issues that were increasingly in danger of drowning out much of the intended celebration of the Queen’s platinum jubilee this year. That may yet happen, depending on how Prince Andrew responds. The most obvious of these is the continuing case for sexual justice under the law, not least in cases involving rich and powerful men like the prince. The other issue concerns the reputational damage – whatever the outcome of the case – to the monarchy and the British state at home and abroad.  Judge Kaplan’s ruling, in a 45-page document, was emphatic. One by one, it dismantled the prince’s lawyers’ arguments for throwing out Ms Giuffre’s claim that she was forced to have sex with him in London, New York and the Caribbean when she was 17, which he denies. Unless the prince appeals against the ruling, he now faces an inevitable phase of pre-trial exchanges before the case comes to court. This could include examination of his texts, emails, phone records and diaries, as well as deposition interviews with the prince and, perhaps, his family. For the palace, it is already the stuff of nightmares. The prince’s options narrowed dramatically this week. He appears to have three main legal options. He could attempt to settle the matter financially in an out-of-court agreement, although he may have to borrow heavily to do this, and Ms Giuffre’s lawyers said this week that she was interested in vindication rather than just money. He could refuse to cooperate with the process, which would invite the court to issue a default judgment in favour of Ms Giuffre, which he would then also attempt to ignore – a humiliating course at every turn. Or he could cooperate with the process, which would open him to a lot of further publicity, as well as detailed cross-examination that, judging by his television interview in 2019, he is badly equipped to handle well. None of these look promising for the reputations of the prince or the monarchy. Until now, Prince Andrew had been allowed by his family to respond to the case in his own way, as essentially a private matter, funded by the Queen and by the sale of property. He had withdrawn from public duties, but he had given no indication that he would not attempt to resume public life once the case is over, whatever the outcome. The palace’s action now means no such attempt at rehabilitation will be countenanced. It remains to be seen whether the prince finally grasps the seriousness of his position. His approach was wrong in the first place, but it became wholly unsustainable this week. However, the legal case in New York remains a personal threat to the prince and a public one to the monarchy. As it evolves, the prince faces a crash course in what the much-vaunted idea of public duty actually entails in the modern world. It would help if faith and political leaders, as well as civil society and the media, could learn to debate our constitutional monarchy better and less deferentially. Prince Andrew must now stop running, must tell the truth in court and must accept that he will have to walk away from his public role for ever.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Prince Andrew: time to tell the truth in court | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/13/the-guardian-view-on-prince-andrew-time-to-tell-the-truth-in-court
1/14/2022,"Checks and balances are built into every democracy. On Monday, the House of Lords has the chance to show how much this matters and why. Amendments added to the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill by the government late last year would restrict the right to protest beyond the measures already debated by MPs, and criminalise trespass. The new powers granted to the police by these extra clauses, along with sentences of up to a year for offences such as obstructing “nationally significant infrastructure” including roads and airports, are an assault on civil liberties. Freedom of expression, including the freedom of assembly, is central to a liberal democracy. Governments often need to hear what protesters have to say. For ministers to attack them is particularly worrying at a time when some senior Conservatives are pushing back against environmentalism more broadly, as well as against anti-racist initiatives. What ministers have cynically done is attempt to bypass parliamentary scrutiny. Priti Patel, the home secretary, added 18 pages to the bill in late November that had not been there when MPs voted for it in July. Unlike the rest of the bill, however, where the Lords can merely send amendments back to the Commons to be reconsidered, because the latest amendments were introduced in the upper house, they will fall if peers vote against them. This presents the second chamber with a rare opportunity to reject some of the most draconian elements of this legislation, and also to endorse the role of parliamentary scrutiny.  Last year, peers warned of a drift towards “government by diktat”. A committee report pointed to the democratic deficit caused by ministers’ increasing reliance on secondary legislation and guidance over primary legislation and the robust scrutiny that goes with it. The peers argued that the correct balance between parliament and the executive had been lost, and rejected explanations that relied on the unique circumstances produced by Brexit and the pandemic. The relationship between the government and parliament, they said, “must be reset: not restored to how things were immediately before these exceptional recent events but reset afresh”. Monday’s vote is a test of whether peers will stick by their recent demand for the government to “stand ready to accept new methods of scrutiny and of holding them to account”. Labour has yet to reveal how its peers will vote on the amendments, though the then shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, last year described the bill as “a mess”, and criticised its attack on the right to protest. Sir Keir Starmer should now come out strongly against the added measures, on grounds of their illiberal intent and also the undermining of parliamentary process that their introduction in the Lords represents. But the rejection of this brazen attempt to remove human rights from citizens should not just be left to the government’s political opponents. Next week is an opportunity for everyone in the upper house who believes in basic democratic freedoms to unite against a government that, with this and other measures such as its nationality and borders bill and compulsory voter ID, has revealed a disturbingly repressive face.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on criminalising protest: the Lords must take a stand | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/13/the-guardian-view-on-criminalising-protest-the-lords-must-take-a-stand
1/14/2022,"The decline of seed-dispersing animals is damaging plants’ ability to adapt to climate breakdown, a study has found. Almost half of all plant species depend on animals to spread their seeds, but scientists fear these plants may be at risk of extinction when animals are driven to migrate to cooler areas, as plants cannot easily follow.  Researchers used machine learning from more than 400 seed dispersal networks worldwide to examine what would happen when animals left areas affected by global heating. They found these plants’ capacity to adapt to climate change has already dropped by 60% globally. The researchers warn this may lead to the permanent loss of some species. “The goal of this project is to understand what we are losing when we move species from their ecosystems and the roles those species are playing that are going to be lost when they disappear,” said Dr Evan C Fricke, an ecologist at Rice University in Texas and lead author of the paper published in the journal Science. “For example, birds and mammals are often hit hard by habitat loss and direct exploitation but they play an important role as seed dispersers. We wanted to understand what the decline of birds and mammals means for plants’ ability to keep pace with climate change.” “Climate change and the global decline of bird and mammal biodiversity [are] tightly linked,” said Fricke. “First, seed dispersers help plants’ ability to track climate change. But that process is sufficiently disrupted, so much so that the plant species can no longer persist under an altered climate. The study shows that the decline of this biodiversity, on a global scale, puts our climate resilience at risk – the global resilience for forests and other plant communities to deal with climate change.” The research examined how crucial seed dispersal is for the survival of plants. “Plants by definition stay put, so they’ve always relied on animals for seed and pollen transport,” said Prof Carlos Peres of the University of East Anglia, who was not involved in the study. “Yet humans have systematically driven wide-ranging large-bodied seed dispersers to extinction in both history and prehistory, and we continue to decimate their populations to this day, particularly in the tropics. “This study shows that these baseline dispersal functions have drastically shrunk since humans conquered all islands and continents, leaving plants little adaptive resilience against the current ravages of climate change.” The report also offered solutions, including that more space should be given to habitats that are useful for plants and biodiversity, in order to restore the plant community.",News/Environment,Plants at risk of extinction as climate crisis disrupts animal migration,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/13/plants-at-risk-of-extinction-as-climate-crisis-disrupts-animal-migration
1/14/2022,"My friend David Peace, who has died aged 74 at Dignitas after suffering from motor neurone disease, undertook 20 years of adventures as a teacher of English in far-flung locations, and often dangerous terrain, before returning to the UK in the late 1980s to take on roles in management development and as an executive coach. He was born to working-class parents, Ivy and Walter Peace; went to Tudor Grange grammar school in Solihull; and read classics at St Catharine’s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1969. David joined Voluntary Service Overseas and was sent to Sudan, then VSO’s most extreme hardship posting, where he taught English and travelled widely.  After a PGCE in Teaching English as a Foreign Language at the University of London, David worked in the early 1970s on an oil concession in the Libyan Sahara. Col Muammar Gaddafi had declared that all Libyans must have English lessons. The company David worked for was soon nationalised, so Gaddafi became his ultimate boss. In 1976 David moved to Saudi Arabia, where he became principal of the Royal Saudi air force School of English. That involved a decade of management and politics, balancing the complex competing interests of British Aerospace (his employer), the British government (its contracting body) and the client (the Saudi air force). David returned to the UK in his early 40s, in 1987, to do an MBA at City University (now City, University of London). He became global director of management development for BAE, and subsequently undertook a similar role for Tarmac plc. He then moved into work as an executive coach, counsellor and career-change adviser to senior executives, plus occasional hands-on management roles including running a barristers’ chambers in Middle Temple. After retirement in 2005 David took on various volunteer roles, including chair of the Cambridge Society of London, secretary of the St Catharine’s College Society, and chair of a Westminster residents’ association. He sang in many choirs, played the piano, was a keen squash player and loved tennis. In 2019 David was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, which proved to be rapidly progressive. There is currently no prevention, treatment or cure and from the outset David was totally open with his many friends. He started a blog, interspersing entertaining stories from his life with direct, no-holds-barred accounts of the progress of his illness. He also supported the establishment by the MND Association of the David Peace Fund, which has raised more than £23,000. Soon after diagnosis, David joined Dignitas, the Swiss organisation that provides for assisted dying. His support for Dignity in Dying, which campaigns for a change in the UK law on assisted dying, resulted in considerable media coverage.",News/Education,David Peace obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/13/david-peace-obituary
1/14/2022,"Rishi Sunak has been accused of going “missing in action” on Britain’s unfolding energy crisis, as he faced claims he was positioning himself for a potential leadership bid. With pressure growing on the chancellor to act, Rachel Reeves, his Labour shadow, said urgent steps were needed to help hard-pressed families before an expected surge in gas and electricity prices from April.  “The chancellor has been missing in action on the energy crisis, leaving working people worrying about what the government will do as bills skyrocket and their taxes are about to be hiked,” she said. It comes after Sunak declined on Wednesday night to hand his full backing to Boris Johnson amid growing public anger over Downing Street parties, with the chancellor using a Twitter post to issue a lukewarm endorsement of the prime minister, fuelling intense speculation among Tories over his own leadership ambitions. While Johnson apologised in parliament for attending a Downing Street “bring your own booze” garden party during the May 2020 lockdown, Sunak spent Wednesday on a ministerial visit to Devon, hundreds of miles from Westminster. In a carefully worded tweet posted at 8pm, after eight hours of public silence, Sunak said he supported Johnson’s request for patience until the conclusion of an official inquiry. There have been suggestions at Westminster that Sunak could withdraw his support from the embattled prime minister by resigning. But a former Tory cabinet minister dismissed that idea, saying: “He who wields the knife never wears the crown. You don’t want to do a [Michael] Heseltine.” Sources close to the chancellor said he had returned to London to hold a raft of meetings at the Treasury on Thursday on how best to respond to the energy crisis, amid signs of the government beginning to ready a response after months of pressure from consumer groups, industry representatives, and MPs. It is understood a plan will be announced before Friday 4 February, when the energy watchdog Ofgem is expected to announce by how much average bills will rise as it lifts the cap on what energy companies can charge. Without intervention, British consumers face a rise in their energy bills of more than £700 from April. “The chancellor has been conducting meetings all week on how to best to respond to the energy crisis, including with the prime minister, colleagues and fellow MPs,” said a Tory source. “Unlike the Labour party, we are considering the complexities of the situation and working on how best to target support appropriately.” Energy industry sources said they had been concerned for some time that ministers were taking too long to grasp the severity of the situation. Coming amid surging costs on the wholesale markets, the hike is expected to drive millions of homes into fuel poverty for the first time and take a disproportionate toll on households with lower incomes and older billpayers. “We’re expecting something to be done within the next couple of weeks, before the new price cap is announced,” one industry source said. “But we can only hope that the plans are enough to address the scale of the crisis without playing politics.” “Since the autumn it has felt like we’re dealing with a government which half hopes that the situation may resolve itself; that maybe the [gas] markets will cool off, and it won’t look so bad by the spring. But thankfully there are parts of government which can now see the wider economic implications of these energy costs,” the source added. Peter Smith, director of policy and advocacy at the charity National Energy Action, said action was vital before the April jump in utility bills. “Without providing clarity urgently, this risks leaving many members of the public wondering whether or not there is a plan to help,” he said. Labour claimed Sunak had been repeatedly absent at key moments. In December, he was forced to fly back from meetings with Silicon Valley executives in California as the Omicron wave of Covid-19 worsened and hospitality businesses pressed for help from the Treasury. Reeves said: “He has got form on going awol. He had to be dragged back kicking and screaming from California when businesses faced huge risks when the Omicron variant hit, he was nowhere to be seen during PMQs or when we debated a VAT cut on home energy bills in parliament this week.” Possible interventions that could be considered by the chancellor include reforms to the warm homes discount (WHD), including a possible state-funded expansion of the scheme to help the most vulnerable customers with the cost of their bills. Energy suppliers have suggested £20bn of loans, possibly backed by government guarantees, could help cover the cost of providing a safety net for bust providers before borrowed funds would be repaid at a later date. However, there are concerns over how this might look politically, while a stubbornly high energy price could make repayments at a later date harder to stomach. Another option would be to cut the 5% rate of VAT on energy bills – a plan called for by Labour but so far rejected by the government, despite it having been promoted by Boris Johnson as a potential Brexit bonus before he became prime minister. Analysts at the US investment bank Goldman Sachs – including chief UK economist Steffan Ball, a former top adviser to Phillip Hammond – said they expected an energy support package worth about £3.4bn funded through government borrowing. It said this could include a £100 increase in the WHD scheme, alongside a VAT cut and loans to energy suppliers. Options including a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, which have benefited from soaring prices, as well as any increase in benefits, appear unlikely, they added.",News/Politics,"Rishi Sunak ‘missing in action’ on UK energy crisis, Labour say",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/rishi-sunak-missing-in-action-on-uk-energy-crisis-labour-say

Emily Lewis died when the rigid inflatable boat (Rib) hit a buoy in Southampton Water on 22 August 2020. Twelve people were taken to hospital after the crash in which two people were thrown overboard.  A report by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) found that shortly after 10am the teenager was “catapulted into the handrail directly in front of her seat” when the Rib crashed into the north-west Netley buoy in Southampton Water at 38.4 knots (44 mph). It found that all passengers on the boat suffered injuries of some kind. An inquest into her death heard that Emily, from Park Gate near Southampton, was taken to nearby Southampton general hospital, where she died of an upper abdominal injury. It is understood that Emily’s father, Simon, mother, Nikki, and 19-year-old sister, Amy, were also on the boat, and that both her mother and sister suffered broken arms. Michael Lawrence, 54, who was driving the boat, has been charged with gross negligence manslaughter. Michael Howley, 51, who owns the company that operated the boat trip, Seadogz, has been charged with failing to take all reasonable steps to secure that the boat was operated in a safe manner. In a statement released previously through Hampshire constabulary, her family said: “We are all in shock that our beautiful daughter and sister is no longer with us, and words just don’t seem available to express our deep sense of loss.” Stuart Parkes, head teacher at Brookfield School where Emily was a pupil, described her as “kind, compassionate” and as a “bright, conscientious student”.

1/14/2022,"The Guardian’s world affairs editor assesses the outcome of three rounds of talks this week about the fate of Ukraine, involving Russia, the US, Nato and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE). Did the talks achieve anything?  Not much. The Russians have described them as a “dead end”. The gap between what the US and its allies were prepared to talk about – reciprocal limits on missiles and military exercises and other confidence-building measures – and what Moscow was demanding – guarantees that Ukraine and other former Soviet bloc states would never join Nato – is as wide at the end of the week as it was at the beginning. But at least the possibility of finding common ground has been tested, and diplomacy is being given a chance. Is there any more clarity about what Russia wants? Yes. It is clear now that Russia was not using its troop build-up and its demands about Nato as a bluff to achieve gains on other matters. The three meetings this week have provided opportunities for Russia to take an off-ramp and find a face-saving solution, but Moscow has not taken them. There is little doubt any more that Vladimir Putin is seeking nothing less than a transformation in European security, with a much-reduced Nato presence along its borders. Are there likely to be more talks? Russian officials on Thursday did not make it sound like there was much appetite in Moscow for further discussions. The Poles suggested having an intensified dialogue on security issues within the framework of the OSCE, but the Russians have said all along they want a quick resolution, rather than an ongoing process of airing grievances. Ukraine has suggested a summit to address the crisis, this time with Kyiv at the table, but there has been no response from Moscow. What happens next? The diplomats go back to their capitals to discuss the next steps. All eyes will be on Moscow and the movements of Russian troops and armour in the region around Ukraine. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, is due to give a press conference on Friday. That should give a clearer idea of Putin’s state of mind. The Russians have demanded the US give written comments on the draft agreements that Moscow published in December, which include the proposed limits on Nato. It is not clear yet whether Washington will submit those written responses summing up its objections. Has the chance of war increased or decreased after the talks? Increased. The probability that Putin was using the pressure on Ukraine as leverage to get something else was always small. Now it has all but disappeared. It is also clearer that the US and its allies are not ready to offer a fudge on Ukraine’s Nato membership, acknowledging that it is unlikely for the foreseeable future. After this week, we know that Putin is ready to go to the very brink of war.

1/14/2022,"As recently as 2019, Christine Lee was being awarded and congratulated personally by then prime minister, Theresa May, for helping Chinese-British cooperation and had been photographed with David Cameron during his time at No 10. Three years on, however, and the Chinese-British relationship has dramatically changed.  Now at the centre of an MI5 security warning to MPs, the 58-year-old anglo-Chinese solicitor had been lauded by Downing Street as the founder of the British Chinese Project, a non-profit organisation aiming to promote engagement, understanding and cooperation between the Chinese community and wider UK society. “I also wish you well with your work to further the inclusion and participation of British-Chinese people in the UK political system,” May wrote in a letter to Lee. Lee herself was by then eagerly participating in the political system, having donated to the Labour MP Barry Gardiner and his constituency party. Her son was also taken on as a policy researcher in his office, working there until his resignation on Thursday. Gardiner had been a close ally of the British Chinese Project (BCP), going on to set up an All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) at Westminster, which received thousands of pounds of funding. Electoral Commission records show that Christine Lee & Co – her law firm – has donated £584,177 to Gardiner’s office, along with an April 2013 donation of £5,000 to the local association of Sir Ed Davey, now the Liberal Democrat leader. Lee’s other interests have been extensive. Records at Companies House – which state that she has British nationality – record that she holds or has held 16 directorships, at least eight of which remain active. As for links to the Chinese government, Lee has been open in that the website of her Birmingham law firm, Christine Lee & Co Solicitors, records its role as legal adviser to the Chinese embassy. It states: “Much of the success of the firm has been spearheaded by Madame Christine Lee herself, propelling the firm forward into a pre-eminent firm within the UK Chinese community and is now a reputable name in both the UK and China.” Indeed, her achievements were not going unrecognised in public in China itself. A report on Chinese state media in 2019 records that she was one of the representatives of the Chinese community overseas who were invited to participate in the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. Referring to her by her Chinese name, Li Zhenju, the report described her as a “well-known Chinese lawyer in the UK” and quoted her as saying that China’s development “brings dignity and self-confidence to overseas Chinese”. It goes on to report that Lee had moved in 1974 with her parents from Hong Kong to Northern Ireland, where in school she was said to have been was often teased by classmates. “I understood at that time that no matter how fluent my English is, and no matter what nationality I am, I will always have yellow skin, black eyes, and the blood of the descendants of Yan and Huang will always flow in my body,” Lee is quoted as saying. It was this experience that also set her on the path to becoming a lawyer, and eventually turning a focus towards encouraging and assisting British-Chinese people to get involved in politics, starting her support for a 19-year-old who was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempt to get elected in London at the 2009 European parliamentary elections. “The meaning of this election is not about winning or losing. A 19-year-old Chinese can take the first step, why can’t others continue to stand up?” Lee was quoted as saying.",News/Politics,"Profile: Christine Lee, the woman at centre of MI5 security warning",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/13/profile-christine-lee-the-woman-at-centre-of-mi5-security-warning
1/14/2022,"Wordle has taken over your timeline through pure force of pleasantness. Every day, an empty six-tiered grid appears in the world’s browser. We try to guess a secret five-letter word; with each entry the player learns if the letters they used appear in the solution, appear in the solution and are in the right place, or aren’t in the solution at all. So, you might navigate from ASKEW to ABLED, before eventually arriving at ABBEY. There’s only one new Wordle puzzle a day, and designer Josh Wardle has not included any of the garish barnacles that tend to accrue to breezy mobile pastimes. That philosophy has made it a runaway success with hundreds of thousands of players. In a media environment awash with misinformation and division, it’s just kinda nice to spend a few minutes every day trying to guess a word.  But what if Wordle mutated into a much more confrontational, brain-burning trial? What if Wordle became evil? Ladies and gentlemen, I give you: Absurdle. Absurdle is the invention of a designer who goes by the alias “qntm”. Consider it an alternative ruleset to Wordle – a game that sharpens the original premise into a horrific machiavellian scheme. The gambit is heady, but I’ll try to explain it the best I can. Wordle is circled around a single word the player is trying to deduce by eliminating the letters on the board. Absurdle, on the other hand, never picks a specific answer, and instead pares down the list of potential solutions as little as possible with each entry. So, for instance, if the player starts off with “PRUNE” Absurdle will identify a bucket of words composed of letters that do not appear in that five-letter combination and take refuge within it. Counter with “ADIEU” and the list gets smaller. The more guesses you make, the smaller the answer list gets, until a resolution is forced from the thick matrix of logic. The goal is to back Absurdle into a corner, where, through all of your guesses and potential letter arrangements, there is only one word in the dictionary that fits the algorithm that you and the game have created. Voila, you’ve beaten Absurdle at its own game. “The technique which Absurdle uses is well known to anybody who’s ever played Hangman as the executioner,” says qntm. “There is always the temptation to change your chosen word or phrase retroactively to invalidate your opponent’s guesses. That’s almost exactly what Absurdle does.” Qntm says that the inspiration for Absurdle grew, in part, out of another one of his projects called “Hatetris”. That game puts you in front of a cursed Tetris board that consistently serves up the worst possible piece. (Imagine getting three of the L-shaped blocks in a row? A fate worse than death.) The idea is to give a sense of personality to the AI system and let players wrestle with the ghost in the machine. “In the same way that Hatetris was an experiment to find the most difficult possible variant of Tetris, Absurdle is an experiment to find the most difficult possible variant of Wordle,” explains qntm. “In both cases, I’m taking a seemingly single-player game and turning it into an adversarial, asymmetric two-player game; turning a passive computer into an opponent which is playing to win. I think that’s a fun twist.” Already, a small contingency of obsessives have become consumed with the idea of Solving Wordle – breaking down this game to its core fundamentals through the raw power of coding and identifying the science-sealed ideal strategy to crush the puzzles, consistently, on the second or third try. (For what it’s worth, I’ve heard that “SOARE” is the most mathematically sound first guess.) So qntm wants Absurdle to be a challenge to other programmers. Achieving ideal Wordle strategy is one thing, ideal Absurdle strategy is quite another. But qntm also balks at the idea that Absurdle somehow represents a more diabolical interpretation of our tranquil word game – one where we are engaged in an eternal duel with our smartphones. No, qntm believes that the only sinister Wordle spinoffs are the rip-offs popping up in droves on app stores. Absurdle might taunt you, but it aims to be an ally, not an enemy. “Absurdle is up-front about the challenge it lays down for you,” he says. “The evil and confrontational variants of Wordle are the fake third-party clones for sale on the App Store. Don’t buy them. They aren’t by Josh Wardle. Don’t reward scummy behavior.” “Wordle is free. Absurdle too. If you need either game on your phone, save a web link on your home screen.”",News/US news, Absurdle: the machiavellian version of Wordle ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/13/absurdle-machiavellian-version-of-wordle
1/14/2022,"Londoners should avoid strenuous physical activity on Friday due to “very high” levels of pollution, experts have warned. The poor air quality is the result of an intense area of high pressure covering western Europe. The associated lack of air movement means emissions from vehicles and other pollutants are not blown away as they usually would be.  The government’s forecast predicts pollution levels will hit band 10, the highest level on the scale. The last time pollution levels hit this mark was in March 2018. Older people and those with lung or heart problems should avoid strenuous physical activity, the government’s official advice stated, while people with asthma may need to use inhalers more often. Even healthy people should “reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat”. The worst pollution is forecast to be in the city centre, with the dirtiest air stretching from Stratford in the east to Hammersmith in the west, though pollution levels are expected to be high throughout the entire city. Earlier this week Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said car use had returned to close to pre-pandemic levels, and that the effect on residents could be disastrous. “If we do not double down on our efforts to deliver a greener, more sustainable future, we will replace one public health crisis with another – caused by filthy air and gridlocked roads.” Pollution levels are expected to return to normal by Saturday.",News/UK news,Londoners told to reduce physical activity on Friday due to pollution,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/13/londoners-told-to-reduce-physical-activity-on-friday-due-to-pollution
1/14/2022,"My friend and former colleague Colin Slater, who has died aged 87, reported on more than 3,000 Notts County football matches, first for local newspapers and then, over a span of more than 50 years, for BBC Radio Nottingham, following the club’s fortunes as they rose and fell from the fourth to the first tier of English football and back again.Few football journalists can have so clearly embodied the institution on which they reported in the minds of supporters, players and officials. When Colin wrote a memoir of his time at Meadow Lane in 2011, he gave it the title Tied Up With Notts. He was proud of his close and warm association with what was, until recently, the world’s oldest professional league club, founded in 1862, but he never forfeited his journalistic objectivity and was as critical as any disaffected fan on the occasions when the team fell into the hands of unscrupulous or negligent owners.When, during one of the odder periods in the club’s history, Sven-Göran Eriksson, the former England manager, was appointed director of football at a club then in the fourth tier, lured by what soon turned out to be nonexistent financial backing from North Korea, Colin was given the first one-to-one interview. He was pleasantly surprised when the Swede opened their conversation by asking a question of his own: “I hear you’ve been here a long time and attend every game, so I want to know something about you. Tell me about yourself.” No one, Colin reflected, had ever asked him to explain his background. An outsider might add that this was their mistake.Colin was born in Shipley, and went to Belle Vue grammar school in nearby Bradford. After training on local weekly newspapers, covering Bradford City, he moved to Nottingham, where he joined the Evening News, becoming their Notts County correspondent in 1959. As early as 1965 he was helping to save the club from extinction by persuading a local car dealer to write a cheque for £10,000.In 1968 he accepted an offer to become the first press officer – later chief information officer – of Nottinghamshire county council, while taking on commentary duties on Notts for the newly created BBC Radio Nottingham. In the summer he would commentate on the cricket at Trent Bridge, sometimes acting as the PA announcer, and running Nottinghamshire CCC’s marketing department from 1988-96.He never lost the trace of West Yorkshire, either in his gentle conversational voice or the more urgent tone that came through the radio on the occasions when the Magpies did something worth getting excited about. The club named a suite after him, making him a lifetime honorary president; he chaired their former players’ association and was a trustee of the Notts County Foundation. John Motson called him “a doyen of the broadcasting industry”.A tall man of great humour and unfailing courtesy, he chaired the local bench of magistrates, helped found the east Midlands branch of the Lord’s Taverners charity, and was a trustee of Nottingham’s day centre for homeless people. Active in the Christians in Sport organisation, in 1995 he was elected to represent the diocese of Southwell and Nottingham as a lay member of the General Synod. In 2001 he was appointed MBE for services to radio broadcasting and the community in Nottingham.",Sport/Football,Colin Slater obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/13/colin-slater-obituary
1/14/2022,"Kanye West, also now known as Ye, has been named as a suspect in a battery report taken by the Los Angeles police department in the early hours of Thursday morning, following an incident outside the Soho Warehouse, a members-only club. West has not been arrested, Variety confirmed on Thursday. LA’s Fox 11 first broke the story, claiming the rapper, 44, punched a fan who asked for an autograph.  Citing law enforcement sources, TMZ reported the incident occurred around 3am and is being investigated as a misdemeanor battery, which carries a maximum jail sentence of six months. The website published furtively recorded video of an irate West on a street, filmed “sometime between Wednesday night and Thursday morning”, in which West can be heard yelling, “Did y’all say that or not? Did y’all say that or not? … Cuz that’s what happened right fucking now.” TMZ also reported that West was partying earlier in the evening at Delilah’s nightclub in West Hollywood with the actor Julia Fox, whom he has recently started dating. He later left the club while Fox stayed behind. The news comes a day after organizers for the Coachella music festival confirmed West as a headliner for the April 2022 event along with Billie Eilish and Harry Styles. It would be West’s first full set at North America’s largest music festival since he headlined there in 2011. This is not West’s first brush with law enforcement for battery – in March 2014, West pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of battery against a photographer whom he charged during a paparazzi swarm at LAX in July 2013. The incident, in which West attempted to wrestle the camera from the man’s hands, was captured on video. As part of his probation, West was required to undergo 24 anger management sessions, perform 250 hours of community service and pay restitution to the victim. Beverly Hills police also investigated an incident in January 2014 in which West was accused of assaulting a man at a chiropractor’s office. The rapper reached a civil settlement with the man and was not charged.",Arts/Music,Kanye West named as suspect in LA criminal battery investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/13/kanye-west-criminal-battery-investigation
