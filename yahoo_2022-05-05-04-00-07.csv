5/5/2022,"New videos show the lengths Alabama prison guard Vicky White went to in order to abscond with an extremely violent murder inmate who officials say she’d previously lavished with extra food. White, 56, the assistant director of corrections in Lauderdale County, vanished last Friday with 38-year-old Casey White (no relation), an inmate awaiting trial for stabbing 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway to death in 2015. The six-foot-nine White had already been sentenced in 2019 to 75 years for a crime spree that included attempting to gun down his ex-girlfriend, stealing an SUV, shooting and killing a dog, and taking three hostages. Vicky White had filed for retirement on Thursday after what Sheriff Rick Singleton described as an unblemished and decorated career, but investigators have since found out that she secretly had a “special” relationship with Casey. “We got information from some of the inmates over the weekend, that they had a relationship,” Singleton told WAAY 31. “What they were talking about was he had extra food on his trays. He was getting special privileges. She was doing special things for him that other inmates didn’t get. That he was getting treated special.” Guard Who Fled With Murder Inmate Was Cashed Up and Eyeing Florida, Her Family Says The pair, who may have first met in early 2020 when Casey White was brought to Lauderdale County for an arraignment, did not have any physical contact but their relationship extended after Vicky’s work hours, he said. New videos released Tuesday show Vicky escorting a shackled Casey White into the back of her patrol car on Friday morning after telling colleagues she was taking him to the courthouse for a mental health evaluation before going to the doctor because she felt unwell. Casey White was supposed to be supervised by two deputies but Vicky told her subordinate that other officers had left for court, and she was the only one left with a firearm, Singleton said. The pair then drove to a shopping center about 10 minutes away, ditched the patrol car, and jumped into a copper-colored 2007 Ford Edge SUV. A tipster provided information about the SUV but, according to Singleton, the information was prematurely released by the U.S. Marshals before investigators could try to track it down so the couple have possibly ditched that car by now, too. Another short clip released Wednesday shows the pair driving down Huntsville Road on their way to the Florence Square shopping center, where they abandoned the patrol car. White’s patrol car can be seen in the top right corner of the surveillance footage. Vicky was a frugal saver and was flush with cash after selling her home recently, the mother of her late ex-husband told The Daily Beast on Tuesday. While Francis White has no idea where her ex-daughter-in-law may have fled, she said Vicky had previously expressed a desire to head to Florida. “Maybe he’s got her brainwashed,” she said. Meanwhile, the ex-girlfriend terrorized by Casey White in his 2015 crime spree said she’s terrified he will track her down while on the lam. “We are freaking out,” she told WAAY 31, without being identified. “We don’t know if he is going to show up and take us out like he tried to do before.” A warrant has been issued for Vicky White, 56, charging her with permitting or facilitating escape in the first degree in connection with capital murder suspect Casey White's escape from jail: https://t.co/9Lx6DHM6PC pic.twitter.com/hULhU1g1QR — U.S. Marshals (@USMarshalsHQ) May 3, 2022 Casey White is considered armed and dangerous as he would now have access to Vicky’s firearm. A $15,000 reward has been offered for anyone with information leading to the pair’s capture, and a warrant has been issued for Vicky White for aiding an escape. While her colleagues initially hoped that she may have been coerced into the extraordinary escape, they now believe she was a willing participant. “Personally I think she’s already regretting what she’s done,” Singleton said. “The sooner she brings this to an end the better for her.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/5/2022,"DENYS KARLOVSKY - WEDNESDAY, MAY 4, 2022, 04:18 PM Ukrainian intelligence has established that Russia is carrying out covert mobilisation of former military personnel, the unemployed and Russian Cossacks from the southern regions. Source: Report of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence of Ukraine Quote: ""To replenish the reserves of the occupying troops, the Russian Federation is continuing covert mobilisation measures. The main attention of Ruscist agitators is given to the recruitment of ""volunteers"" from among the Russian ""Cossacks"" of the Rostov region and the Krasnodar Territory. Also of interest are citizens who have lost their jobs as a result of international sanctions and former military personnel living in other post-Soviet countries."" Details: In addition, volunteers are also being sought in Primorsky Krai in the Far East. Ukrainian intelligence officers claim that those wishing to go to fight in Ukraine are being offered at least 200,000 rubles (almost 90,000 hryvnias) monthly. In the Belgorod, Bryansk and Kursk regions bordering Ukraine, events are being held to recruit those who want to do ""short-term military service under a contract"" for up to 3 months. In addition, preparations are being made in these areas for the partial mobilisation of the male population in the event of a sharp deterioration in the military operations in Ukraine. However, rumours of significant Russian losses in the war against Ukraine are circulating among those wishing to join the Russian military. Also, the military occupation troops of the Russian Federation often do not receive the promised money or receive significantly smaller amounts than agreed upon when signing their contracts. Background: Earlier, the head of the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defence, Kyrylo Budanov, said that the Russian invaders were developing plans to ""legalise"" the annexation of the occupied territories of southern Ukraine and the revival of the ""Tavricheskaya province"" - the administrative formation at the time of the Russian Empire. Budanov also said that there are signs that the Russian military leadership is preparing to make an open declaration of a state of war with Ukraine, to introduce martial law and to start a general mobilisation of the population. Ukrainian intelligence has learned of Russian plans that regions in Siberia and the Far East will be tasked with recruiting 200 people every week to be sent to the front in Ukraine.",World/Ukrayinska Pravda,"Ukrainian intelligence uncovers covert mobilisation of the unemployed and ""Cossacks"" underway in Russia",https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainian-intelligence-uncovers-covert-mobilisation-131857888.html
5/5/2022,"Former royal bodyguard Simon Morgan shared the likely reason behind Prince Harry's security issues. The prince previously said he had been barred from paying for police protection in the UK. Morgan said that since it is publicly funded, Harry would be setting a ""difficult precedent."" A former royal protection officer spoke about the likely reason why Prince Harry isn't allowed to pay for his own police protection while in the UK. Speaking to the ""Today"" show in April, Prince Harry said he wants to attend the Queen's Jubilee celebrations in June which mark the monarch's 70 years on the throne, but security issues could prevent him from doing so. Harry and Meghan Markle gave up their right to publicly-funded police protection when they resigned from royal duties in April 2020. In September 2021, the prince appealed for a judicial review of a government decision that barred him from personally paying for police protection while in the UK. Simon Morgan, a former royal protection officer who worked for the Queen from 2007 until 2013, told Insider that the decision was likely made so not to set a ""difficult precedent."" ""When you get to a point where you can pay for it, that would set a difficult precedent. Because if you can pay for it, it can effectively go to the highest bidder,"" Morgan told Insider. ""Anyone with a certain degree of wealth could pay for it... you're looking at needs versus wants for protection,"" he said. ""And also, it comes down to something quite simple, there probably aren't enough protection officers to fulfill that want."" The Met Police declined to comment when contacted by Insider. While representatives for the Duke of Sussex did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment, a legal spokesperson for Prince Harry said in a statement obtained by Omid Scobie in January that while the Sussexes have a private security team in the US, ""that security cannot replicate the necessary police protection while in the UK."" The spokesperson added that Harry's security was ""compromised"" during a visit to the UK in July 2021 due to the absence of police protection. —Omid Scobie (@scobie) January 15, 2022 Morgan, who set up his own private security firm, Trojan Consultancy, after leaving the royal household, told Insider that it's not surprising that Harry's preference is police protection over a private firm. ""The Duke of Sussex has grown up with cradle to grave police protection, and he clearly values that skillset,"" Morgan said. ""But when you step outside of that, there aren't a lot of teams that have experience with dealing with such high profile principles."" Buckingham Palace did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
