5/13/2022,"Tony Blair has urged Keir Starmer to reject “woke” politics and present a programme for government that is “radical without being dangerous”. A report published by the Tony Blair Institute analyses the impact of class on voting in the 2019 general election and beyond. Based on analysis by the veteran pollster Peter Kellner, it points to particular problems for Labour with two groups: the 26% of voters who fit into the formal definition of middle class; and the 12% who would be defined as working class by pollsters but consider themselves middle class. The first group voted 57% to remain in the EU, yet the Conservatives were 22% ahead with these voters in 2019, despite their central message being that they would “get Brexit done”. These voters, the former Labour leader suggests, are “worried about issues like tax and economic competence”. The second group, whom Blair calls the “aspirational working class”, voted to leave the EU by a narrower 53% but backed the Conservatives over Labour by a 32% margin. In a punchy foreword, Blair claims of this latter group: “A large number voted Conservative despite disagreeing with the party on Brexit. They thought Labour’s far-left economic policy was a bigger threat than Brexit.” Without what he calls the “millstone” of Starmer’s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, Blair claims Labour can win many of these voters back – and analysis of recent polling in the report shows a 12% swing to Labour among this “blue-collar aspirational” group. The former prime minister suggests they are social conservatives, and thus urges Labour to ensure it is on the centre ground on “culture war” issues such as transgender rights. Blair says the party should “plant Labour’s feet clearly near the centre of gravity of the British people, who want fair treatment for all and an end to prejudice, but distrust and dislike the ‘cancel culture’, ‘woke’ mentality.” Labour has sometimes appeared to struggle with culture war issues. For example, Starmer and the party chair, Anneliese Dodds, were criticised recently for being unable to give a straightforward answer to the question: what is a woman? A clearer frontbench line has since been agreed, resulting in the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, telling an interviewer: “Men have penises, women have vaginas, here ends my biology lesson.” The Conservative party co-chair Oliver Dowden has sought to capitalise on the party’s discomfort, accusing Starmer in a recent speech of “kowtowing to the cancel culture brigade” and claiming: “The Corbynistas, they are still there.” Starmer has been accused by some on the left of Labour of winning the leadership under false pretences by espousing key tenets of Corbynism during the campaign in 2020 and then moving towards the centre ground. Blair also calls on Labour to work on rebuilding its economic credibility, as he says the shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, has already begun to do. “Labour must cure both its cultural and its economic aspiration problems. It must do the first to regain those voters who went Tory despite being traditional blue collar. These are the northern ‘red wallers’. But Labour must also do the second to have any realistic chance of winning,” he says. He also warns Starmer against excessive caution – something the Labour leader is charged with by some colleagues. “The bane of progressive politics is to think the choice is between being voter-friendly and boring, or exciting and voter-repellent,” he says. As an example of the kind of radical policy he would like to see, Blair suggests tackling concerns about illegal immigration by introducing biometric ID as a precondition for accessing work and public services.",News/Politics,Tony Blair tells Starmer to drop ‘woke’ politics and focus on economy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/13/tony-blair-tells-keir-starmer-to-drop-woke-politics-and-focus-on-economy-labour

At their best, the 283 of these recorded in England are crystal clear and teeming with life – brown trout and water voles being among the top species associated with them. But for decades chalk streams have been disappearing – some are now just empty hollows in grassland because of overabstraction for water supplies. Others have been ruined by pollutants including sewage overflows. Efforts to save these internationally important habitats have been steadily growing in recent years. One of the most active and successful is on the River Chess in the Chilterns. The river rises just outside Chesham in Buckinghamshire and runs 11 miles to empty into the River Colne at Rickmansworth, gathering water on the way from many hillside springs. Archaeological evidence of settlements from the bronze age onwards is testimony of the importance to this river through human history. To keep it both clean and flowing in 2022 has become a major challenge.

5/13/2022,"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, said Freud. But darlings, let me tell you – a snake is never just a snake. And certainly not in The Essex Serpent (Apple TV+), the new six part miniseries adapted by Anna Symon from Sarah Perry’s 2016 bestselling novel of the same name. At the tail end of the Victorian era and recently liberated by her wealthy, abusive husband’s death from cancer, young widow Cora Seaborne (Claire Danes) abandons London society and moves to Aldwinter on the edge of the Blackwater marshes to pursue a much more fulfilling life as an amateur paleontologist in comfortable clothes. With her she takes her devoted maidservant Martha (Hayley Squires) and her autistic (in modern day terms) son Frankie. Her husband’s former doctor, Luke Garrett (Frank Dillane), becomes a friend – and, in time, a contender at least in his eyes for her affections – and visits often. When sightings of the legendary monster of the marshes begin, Cora theorises that it may be a living fossil – an icthyosaur-like being that escaped evolutionary pressures in the ancient wetlands – while the locals cleave to superstition and supernatural explanations for what they call “the Blackwater Beast”. Between the two stands the Rev Will Ransome (Tom Hiddleston), a man of God but also of the Enlightenment, keen to keep the growing fears and fancies of his flock under control and not call on divine or diabolic explanation unless all others have been exhausted. In this, he is not helped by his curate Matthew, a fire and brimstone type (whose name is surely meant to evoke the Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins, who began his career in Essex in the 17th century) who sees the serpent as a sign from God that urgent repentance of the villagers’ sins is needed. As the friendship between Will, his ailing wife Stella (Clémence Poesy) and Cora grows, so does the attraction between Will and Cora – rather less convincingly on screen than in the book. Perhaps this is down to a lack of chemistry between the leads, or perhaps the miscasting of Hiddleston, who never manages to shed his innate air of suave confidence. It works well when playing a god of mischief amidst a plethora of equally towering egos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe; less so when playing a Victorian vicar humble enough to admit doubts and wrestle with his conscience. Let alone fall in love with a woman cleverer than him, and spend time offering explanations that he is too honest to dismiss out of hand, however much they pain him. It gives his exchanges with Cora a condescending edge that is the death knell to the love and profound yearning that animated their relationship in the novel. Danes, on the other hand, is magnificent as Cora – brusque, athletic, undisguisably intelligent and every inch a woman gradually being restored to life and self in the wake of her husband’s brutality. In fact, all the women are wonderful, from Squires, who brings vitality and conviction to what could be the slightly worthy part of the Socialist servant eager to bring about change, via Lily-Rose Aslandogdu and Dixie Egerickx as guilt-stricken youngsters who fear they summoned the beast, to Poesy who – as gentle, watchful Stella, is a heartbroken and heartbreaking revelation. For all that, there is something strangely cold and sluggish about the adaptation of Perry’s book, which despite being a novel of ideas, was lush and vibrant, too. Although it excavated the links between myth, science and religion, it held up love in all its forms to the light as well. Platonic love, sexual love, requited and unrequited romantic love, love of a child, of a vocation, of discovery, of God. It was Wuthering Heights pulled into shape and given intellectual rigour without losing any of its sweeping gothic passion. But on screen, abundance has become austerity, suppressed feeling shades into inertia and the protagonists keep treading and retreading the same small patch of argumentative ground instead of sparking off each other and forging the greater and greater bond on which the story should turn. Maybe I am simply too much a fan of the book. Symon’s take works perfectly well as a drama that delivers suitably sinuous twists and, under Clio Barnard’s direction, looks grimly fabulous, emerging out of the marsh mists that seem to promise that any malevolence is possible. And Danes grounds and gives a remarkable truth to the whole. But even allowing for the fact that screen adaptations rarely capture the full filigree of a literary novelist’s work (one reason why uncomplicated genre fiction generally fares better – there is more to add, less to lose), it feels like slightly too much has been lost in translation here.",Arts/Television & radio,The Essex Serpent review – Claire Danes is magnificent … unlike Tom Hiddleston,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/13/the-essex-serpent-review-claire-danes-is-magnificent-unlike-tom-hiddleston
5/13/2022,"With high temperatures and high pollen levels forecast this weekend, millions of people with lung conditions or hay fever in the UK are being urged to take precautions. The Met Office is predicting high pollen levels across every area of England and Wales on Friday and Saturday, with medium levels in Northern Ireland and parts of Scotland. The charity Asthma and Lung UK said more than 3 million people in the UK have lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are at risk of attacks or flare-ups this weekend. People are being urged to ensure they keep on taking preventer inhalers if they use them and to keep their reliever inhaler with them at all times. Other tips include staying indoors on high-pollen days and keeping an eye on weather forecasts. Pollen can trigger symptoms such as a tight chest, wheezing and breathlessness in more than half of people living with asthma (59%) and more than a quarter of those living with COPD, according to research from the charity. Allergies can cause airways to tighten up and a build-up of sticky mucus, making it harder to breathe. Asthma attacks can be fatal, with about four people in the UK dying from one every day. “When pollen levels are at their highest this can be deadly for those with lung conditions like asthma who can suffer serious symptoms and have life-threatening attacks,” said Dr Andy Whittamore, the clinical lead for Asthma and Lung UK. “These attacks can leave people fighting for breath, which can be terrifying, but there are things they can do to look after themselves. “Using your preventer inhalers as prescribed is important as the medicine reduces sensitivity and swelling in the airways, helping to prevent symptoms such as wheezing and coughing before they even start. “We also advise people to carry their reliever inhalers every day, especially when they are out and about enjoying the sunshine in case pollen does cause a flare-up of their symptoms. Reliever inhalers quickly relax the muscles in the airways and ease symptoms immediately. “The third thing people can do is to use a steroid nasal spray every day, together with non-drowsy antihistamine tablets to help stop the allergic reaction. People should also check pollen and air pollution forecasts in their local area, so they can avoid going outdoors as much as possible on high pollen days.” The high pollen levels expected this weekend may also affect millions of people who suffer from hay fever. The condition is usually worse when it’s warm, humid and windy. With high levels predicted this weekend, people may be more likely to experience symptoms including sneezing and coughing, a runny or blocked nose, itchy, red or watery eyes, itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears, loss of smell, pain around your temples and forehead, headache, earache and fatigue. Hay fever can last for weeks or months, unlike a cold, which usually goes away after one or two weeks. There is currently no cure for hay fever and people who experience it cannot prevent it. However, the NHS says there are things people can do to ease their symptoms when the pollen count is high across England and Wales on Friday and Saturday. They include putting Vaseline around the nostrils to trap pollen, wearing wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting into the eyes, and showering and changing clothes after being outside to wash pollen off. Other tips include staying indoors whenever possible, keeping windows and doors shut as much as possible, vacuuming regularly and dusting with a damp cloth. Pharmacists can give advice and suggest the best treatments, such as antihistamine drops, tablets or nasal sprays to help with itchy and watery eyes, sneezing, and a blocked nose. Pollen levels are forecast to remain high in England and Wales across the weekend, but are set to fall to medium in north-east England on Sunday and drop to medium in London and the south-east by Monday.",News/Society,Pollen levels prompt warning to UK asthma and hay fever sufferers,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/13/pollen-levels-uk-met-office-warning-asthma-hay-fever-copd
5/13/2022,"Extra supplies of hormone replacement therapy products could be shipped to the UK from France and Poland as soon as next week, a major manufacturer has said after crisis meetings were held to address the nationwide shortage. Tina Backhouse, the general UK manager at Theramex, which makes about a dozen HRT drugs, including Bijuva pills and Femseven patches, said the company needed special permission to bring in products from France that were not licensed in the UK. Theramex’s products are mainly made in Germany, and some are only licensed in other European countries. Backhouse met the UK’s newly appointed HRT tsar, Madelaine McTernan, and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency this week and expects to obtain consent after a further meeting with the agency on Monday. “We are working with MHRA to get special permission. It’s not an unusual thing, other companies do it,” she said. “I don’t think it will be long, we’ve got it [the stock] ready.” Theramex, a private equity-owned pharmaceutical firm based in London, is also preparing to bring in HRT patches from Poland, which are licensed in the UK but need English labels. “We are looking for short-term solutions as well as longer-term solutions in terms of bringing other products from other countries in,” Backhouse said. The UK appears to be the only country with a shortage of HRT products. It was triggered by a surge in demand after the TV presenters Davina McCall and Mariella Frostrup spoke about their menopause experiences. Besins Healthcare, a privately owned firm based in Brussels which makes the most popular oestrogen gel product, said on Thursday that it was “looking at all options for increasing short-term supplies of Oestrogel into the UK”. The British Menopause Society and HRT manufacturers are calling for other measures, including a national list or “formulary” of approved HRT medicines that would allow all doctors and pharmacists to prescribe whichever products are available. When local clinical commissioning groups were created in England in 2013, many previously national-level decision making and budgetary powers passed to them. This means there can be delays in certain areas of the country when new drugs are licensed. Backhouse said: “We have brand new products in this country that are licensed but aren’t being used because of formulary restrictions. At this stage surely we should have a national formulary of HRTs that are available and in stock, rather than waiting for every individual locality to do that. It would be so easy to do.” She said Theramex had a new MHRA-approved product that was only being prescribed in three areas, or used privately by women paying for it themselves. The National Pharmacy Association has also lobbied for pharmacists’ to have the power to change prescriptions made by GPs when certain products are not available.",News/Society,HRT products could be shipped to UK from Europe next week,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/13/hrt-products-could-be-shipped-to-uk-from-europe-next-week
5/13/2022,"Boris Johnson’s Queen’s speech was largely empty of substance. So thank goodness for the housing and planning secretary, Michael Gove. In his contribution he never spoke truer words, at least if anyone understood them. He has dismissed housing targets as “Procrustean … arbitrary … perfect arithmetic”. In plain terms, what Gove meant was that Johnson’s mantra of “build, build, build” (a parroting of his chief party donors, the construction lobby) was senseless. The build-or-be-damned policies of David Cameron and George Osborne had funnelled jobs, people and money into the south-east of England, spawning characterless housing estates from Hampshire to East Anglia. This had enraged Tory voters in villages and small towns, because it sucked the life out of existing communities, crushing high streets and closing local pubs. The response at last week’s local elections was clear: stop the policy. The British housing sector is not “in crisis”. Sectors such as social housing are in trouble and need far more help. But property prices have been rising fast, up 11% from last year. They have risen in all rich countries, driven largely by decades of low interest rates. Gove is right to protest at the fatuous government statistic that Britain “needs” 300,000 houses a year, broken down to individual counties and cities. There is no Leninist requirement of a roof, bedroom and sitting room for each Briton, allocated by the state from birth to death. Whitehall’s centralism can be plain barmy. A housing market responds to changing patterns of migration and demand. Most people would like a different, preferably a better, house. Whether they can realise that preference depends on myriad factors, chiefly price. British housing – overwhelmingly in houses rather than the European preference for flats – is desperately inefficient. As the geographer Danny Dorling has noted, a third of British bedrooms are empty on any given night and even London has a bedroom surplus. Britons have 2.5 rooms each. As for new building, it has virtually no impact on price, since some 90% of house sales are of existing properties. Countries that build extravagantly, such as the US and Australia, have house prices soaring faster than Britain. As Dorling has pointed out, social and demographic differences hold the key to housing supply. The gap between London and the rest of the United Kingdom yawns wider than anywhere in Europe. First-time buyers in Westminster pay an average of £906,000 for a property, while in North Ayrshire they pay £102,000. Yet it is London not Scotland that holds a magnetic hold on young people. Despite the high prices, it still has the youngest population – its median age, of 35, is six years younger than Scotland – and the youngest workforce in Britain. A London street or tube concourse teems with youthful faces. Their living conditions may be cramped, but the Dick Whittington effect is as strong as ever. If Gove really wants to bring down house prices, he should increase market flexibility. The most absurd tax in Britain is stamp duty, a tax on house transfer. Sales soared when the duty was suspended early in the pandemic, and have now slumped. Britons are reckless users of property. Stamp duty penalises downsizing and rewards housing waste. It is mad. The abolition of the tax would free up existing property, allowing retired people to swap places with young families. Higher council tax or a mansion tax would make more sense. The biggest challenge for Gove is the other half of his brief. It lies in what he sees as the true nature of “levelling up”. Every prime minister since Margaret Thatcher has wanted to bless the north – or its voters – rather as the Victorians wanted to help the poor. Yet they all pumped infrastructure and housing subsidy into London, ever widening the gulf. Johnson often says levelling up does not mean “levelling down”. But he continues to tip vanity public spending into London, its railways, airports, bridges, sewers and even, it seems, the buildings of parliament. The reality is that if the north really is to be more attractive as a place to live and work than the south-east, then the south-east must be made less so. This means putting a stop to first-time house-buyer subsidies for Londoners, which anyway just increase prices. For those on lower incomes, house prices would drop over time. It means, as previously mentioned, giving rich councils powers to set higher council tax bands to sting their wealthier residents, motivating them to downsize. It means making London less attractive to foreign property ownership and enforcing the subletting of vacant properties. The stark residential emptiness of the West End is so brazen it must explain the Tories’ loss of Westminster council this month. Levelling up should mean not building over ever wider expanses of the south-east’s countryside to welcome northern migrants. It should mean increasing – and publicising – the competing attractions of the north’s countryside. What has appealed to London’s creativity has been the vitality of its Victorian market hubs and restored commercial architecture. The north has these in plenty and should exploit them. It should fight to keep its young skills, perhaps waiving student debts if graduates stay working five years in the north. House prices are not a random variable. They reflect where people prefer to live. Britain’s poorer regions need policies to help them retain their talent, creativity and prosperity. This will be hard, but success will come when their house prices too can be “in crisis”.

5/13/2022,"A woman who accuses Ben Roberts-Smith of punching her in the face during a late-night argument in a Canberra hotel sustained a large haematoma on her head falling down the stairs at Parliament House earlier in the night, a federal court defamation trial has heard. The woman, with whom Roberts-Smith was having an affair during 2017 and 2018, has previously given evidence a black eye she sustained that night was the result of Roberts-Smith punching her, knocking her backwards on to a bed. Roberts-Smith maintains the injury was sustained when she fell down a flight of stairs earlier in the evening, and said the assault allegation was a “fabrication”. The woman – whose identity has been protected by the court with the pseudonym Person 17 – does not contest she fell down the stairs, but told the court in her evidence given in March she was also punched by Roberts-Smith later that night. Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and one of Australia’s most decorated soldiers, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of ­reports he alleges portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as an act of domestic violence against Person 17. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies all wrongdoing. Called by Roberts-Smith to give evidence in the federal court Friday, a defence industry executive, Terry Nichols, testified he met Person 17 at the end of a function at Parliament House in early 2018. Nichols, a former army officer, said the woman was unsteady on her feet and slurred her speech as she asked him if he knew Ben Roberts-Smith. Nichols said he told Person 17 while he did not know Roberts-Smith, he had recognised him at the event, and would find him. As he was calling a lift to take Person 17 to the car park she attempted to descend a flight of stairs unaided and fell face first, striking her head on the landing, Nichols told the court. He said the fall made a “terrible thud” and Person 17 was momentarily unconscious. When she came round, Nichols said, “there was a very large haematoma on the left side of her forehead above her eye … an immediate consequence of the fall”. Nichols asked two Australian federal police officers, who were nearby, to arrange for an ambulance for her, because of the size of the haematoma: “It was like a large egg, quite a substantial lump above the left eyebrow … given it had happened so quickly, that’s why it was of concern.” Nichols said Person 17 assured him she was not seriously injured: “It’s OK, I’m OK, I just need to see Ben,” Nichols testified she said. Nichols said he left Person 17 with the AFP officers and went to find Roberts-Smith in the car park. He found Roberts-Smith and directed him back to Person 17. He did not see either of them again. In her evidence to the court, Person 17 said: “I fell down about … two or three steps on to the landing and I hit my head as I fell.” The evidence about the stairs is relevant to Roberts-Smith’s defamation case because it relates to one of the key allegations made against him: by the newspapers as part of their truth defence: that person 17 was assaulted in the hotel room she shared with Roberts-Smith. Subpoenaed by the newspapers to give evidence in March this year, Person 17 said Roberts-Smith was angry with her back at their hotel room, yelling in her face, “What the fuck have you done”, saying she had been flirtatious with other men, and had exposed their affair. Person 17 said she just wanted to go to bed and that her head hurt. She told the court Roberts-Smith responded by saying “It’s going to hurt more”, or “I’ll show you hurt”. “And he punched me with his right fist on the side of my face and left eye … I ended up lying on the bed. I just lay there still because I didn’t know what he was going to do next.” “I said ‘my head hurts and I want to go to the hospital’. “He said ‘no, you’ll be fine, I’ll look after you’.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Roberts-Smith was questioned on the alleged incident at the Canberra hotel during his testimony before the court last year. He denied all allegations of violence or threatening behaviour, saying the allegations were “completely false”. “The whole story is a fabrication,” he told the court. “I’ve never hit a woman. I never would hit a woman. And I certainly never hit Person 17.” Roberts-Smith said Person 17 sustained the injuries to her face and side when she fell down the stairs at Parliament House. He said he did not believe she needed to go to hospital, and he took her to the hotel room where he undressed her, put an icepack on her head, and put her to bed. Ben Roberts-Smith’s former wife, Emma Roberts, has previously told the court Person 17 had a black eye several days later when she arrived unannounced at her family home to reveal the affair. Roberts told the court Person 17 told her she had fallen down some stairs at Parliament House. In her evidence, Person 17 said she lied about the cause of the black eye because she feared retribution from Ben Roberts-Smith. “I knew that I would be targeted by him,” she said. Roberts-Smith has previously told the court he and his wife were separated at the time he and Person 17 began their affair. His now ex-wife told the court this was not true, that they were not separated.

5/13/2022,"A Senate committee has called for a royal commission into the robodebt scandal, accusing the government and its departments of the “deliberate withholding” of information about the botched scheme. The Labor-Greens majority committee, chaired by the Greens’ Janet Rice, found the Centrelink debt recovery program it said was announced by Scott Morrison in 2015 had “indiscriminately targeted some of Australia’s most vulnerable people”. “It caused significant and widespread harm to their psychological and financial wellbeing,” the inquiry report said, adding that at least two suicides had occurred among people caught up in what is officially known as the income compliance program. The call was rejected by Coalition senators on the committee who claim a royal commission would “only promote anxiety and undermine trust in Government services”. In March 2020, Guardian Australia broke the news that the government had privately conceded the mammoth, years-long welfare crackdown was unlawful and it would need to pay back hundreds of millions of dollars. Two months later the government publicly announced the backdown, before settling in court a year later for $1.8bn, which included the owed interest on the debts unlawfully issued to 443,000 people. The move came only after court challenges were filed by Victoria Legal Aid and then Gordon Legal in a class action created with the support of Labor’s Bill Shorten that was mocked by the government at the time. Despite the settlement, Labor, the Greens and other crossbenchers, as well as welfare advocates and grassroots campaigns, such as the NotMyDebt group, have long maintained there has been no transparency about how the scheme came to be developed, nor what the government knew about its legality. No ministers or public servants lost their job after the scandal. Rice, who took over from Greens’ Rachel Siewert as the chair of the committee, said the report showed how “devastating the robodebt scheme was for hundreds of thousands of people”. “This tremendous hurt and trauma could have been avoided,” she said in a statement. Some victims reported experiencing depression and anxiety as they dealt with the stress of suddenly owing the government thousands of dollars in debts later found to be unlawful, with some pursued incessantly by private debt collectors until they paid up or having had their tax returns garnisheed without warning. One victim, Nathan Kearney, told Guardian Australia he moved back with his parents to country Victoria and worked 50 hours a week in a job he didn’t like to repay $6,500. Rice claimed Morrison was the “architect of this horrific program”. “He drew up the blueprints when he was the Minister for Social Services, oversaw its expansion as the treasurer and continued it as prime minister until the courts found it unlawful,” he said. “Scott Morrison and his ministers still haven’t explained when they first learned robodebt was illegal, and why they continued until the courts stopped them, despite the clear evidence of the harm they were inflicting.” Morrison has never explained his role in the creation of the scheme, but apologised on behalf of the government for “any hurt or harm” caused by the scheme in comments to parliament in June 2020. Asked about a Labor promise for a royal commission re-announced during the campaign, Morrison said last month he believed the matter had already been “addressed”. “There have been numerous inquiries into this and there’s been court matters which we’ve fully cooperated in, and almost $750m in response to that,” he said. “And the changes in the scheme have been in place.” But the Senate committee said its attempts to enquire into the scheme’s origins and development had been blocked by Morrison government. “The committee met with entrenched resistance and opacity to its request for information from government ministers and departments, severely hindering its ability to produce this report for the Senate,” it said. The committee said it had requested documents including briefings provided to the government during the scheme’s operation, any legal advice, the legal costs attributed to the program and a February 2015 executive minute to the then social services minister, Scott Morrison, that proposed a “new online approach to compliance”. The government has blocked those requests, saying the documents were cabinet-in-confidence or subject to legal professional privilege and that their release would be contrary to the public interest. In a dissenting report, Coalition senators Wendy Askew and Hollie Hughes said there was no need for an royal commission because the issue had “subject to extensive scrutiny including from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, through parliamentary inquiries and has also been subject to decisions of the federal court”. They also claimed “another review on the Income Compliance Program will only promote anxiety and undermine trust in government services on the basis of issues that have been acknowledged and comprehensively addressed”. “To date, over 99% of refunds have been made and approximately 429,000 people have received a refund or had their debts reduced to zero,” they said. Those on Centrelink payments are required to report their income on a fortnightly basis so their benefits are paid at the correct rate. The robodebt scheme sent debt letters to past and present welfare recipients, mostly students and jobseekers, accusing them of underreporting their income. It used a process known as “income averaging”, which used annual tax office data to estimate a person’s fortnightly income. While the calculations were often wildly inaccurate, victims were then required to provide old payslips or bank statements dating back up to seven years to demonstrate they had not been overpaid. The government is said to have ignored at least 76 administrative appeals tribunal decisions questioning the scheme’s legality, starting in January 2017.

I was in shock. I walked around my house trying to deny the reality of what had happened. I was confused as to how I owed this amount of money. Within weeks I began receiving calls, texts and letters from a debt collection agency. I was told that Centrelink had the power to garnish my wages and keep my tax return. I was so ashamed at the time that I didn’t know who to talk to about this.” Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78; Beyond Blue 1300 22 4636",News/Australia news,Senate committee calls for royal commission into robodebt scandal ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/13/senate-committee-calls-for-royal-commission-into-robodebt-scandal
5/13/2022,"The Burbage Valley has been my working week and Sunday rest since the day almost 40 years ago, when a mate and I bunked off school to climb on the gritstone edges that fringe this vast, natural amphitheatre. Much has changed since then, most of it for the better, but the geomantic drama of the place remains as it ever was. Today, as if to emphasise the valley’s qualities as performance space, a film crew is at work on its northern fringe. The director is issuing through a loudhailer instructions that drift along the crags to where I’m hunkered, buried deep in heather. On cue, a cuckoo calls out from the bottom of the valley, from a tangle of fresh young birches where a conifer plantation, ill-conceived and poorly managed, used to stand before most of it was removed. Next, from the oaks behind me, a willow warbler takes the stage, then a stonechat and a wren, both just below me, close to the broad track that runs along the valley. Yet it feels as if I’m waiting for something greater, for the star of the show. And with a shrill call, she’s there: a ring ouzel perched on a large rock fringed with bilberry. Ring ouzels are Burbage’s celebrities, a success story for this species against a picture of national decline. Almost half of Britain’s breeding pairs have disappeared in the last four decades. Their triumph here is partly down to a concentrated conservation effort from ring ouzel fans, who first came, like me, for the climbing or biking, but now monitor these dapper migrants as they return each spring from their winters in Morocco. Known also as mountain blackbirds, ring ouzels wear a blaze of white on their chests and feathers elsewhere are fringed with white, giving a subtle, scalloped effect. They also have a strut about them. The female I’m watching hops down from her perch to work a patch of dead bracken stalks with her bill, straightening often to take a view. And how very straight she stands, in contrast to the dumpy blackbird, an elegant performer on the mountain stage.
