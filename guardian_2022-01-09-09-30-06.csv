1/9/2022,"Explorer and television presenter Simon Reeve is troubled by the carbon footprint of the travel documentaries he makes and sometimes feels a hypocrite, he has confessed. Talking candidly about his climate change guilt and also reflecting on his unhappy teenage years on Sunday’s Desert Island Discs, Reeve accepts that his journeys to Australia, Cuba and the Caribbean with the BBC have given him a damaging environmental record.  “Personally, I would like to think there is some tiny value in the programmes I make, and I hope that mitigates in some ways the enormous footprint that I have, and we have, making these journeys. I am not sure we always get it right,” the 49-year-old tells host Lauren Laverne during his appearance on the BBC Radio 4 programme. “I obviously feel many a time like a hypocrite,” Reeve admits. “We’ve tried to incorporate from the beginning true, honest stories about what’s happening to our planet. And ultimately, the only way we’re going to know what’s happening out there is by going out there and faithfully capturing it and bringing it back for people to see and be shocked by.” Although in recent years his travels have showcased Cornwall, the Lake District and Cumbria, Reeve said his television career had been built partly on his natural urge to try things which others consider dangerous, such as searching for bears in a forest in the middle of the night. Documentaries including Holidays in the Danger Zone: Places That Don’t Exist, Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn have involved filming in hostile surroundings. Reeve cites a perilous moment when he and his team realised the place they had gone to for interviews about the source of an illicit new drug was actually the den of a criminal gang. “I do feel a sense of responsibility in that sense, but I work with people who I trust and I hope trust me, we’re alert to risk and danger probably more than most people,” he says. Reeve also talks to Laverne about his upbringing, which did not follow the conventional lines of the gentlemen explorers of Britain’s past. In fact he reveals he did not fly on a plane until he was an adult: “I think that’s partly why I’m so grateful for the journeys I’ve been on since; I don’t take them for granted as a result.” He discusses being “trouble” as a teenager and clashing with his late father. He hung around with friends who stole cars and committed acts of vandalism. “I was carrying a knife by the time I was 12 or 13 … I’m not proud of what I did or saw or people I knew were up to … I knew what I was doing was wrong,” Reeve says. Despite counselling, Reeve says his confidence disappeared. “I lost my way and by the time it got to exams and schooling I was in a terrible state.” When he left school the TV presenter had only one GCSE and faced an uncertain future. He had no job prospects and had suffered from mental illness since the age of 15. He confides that he once found himself “on the edge of a bridge” considering ending his life, but “stepped back in every possible sense”. An encounter with a kind employee at a benefits office helped reassure him that things might change, he says. Reeve responded by setting off to climb in Glencoe in the Scottish Highlands, inspired by the location of the film Highlander. Reeve then went on to work at the Sunday Times, starting in the post room at 17. He was eventually trusted with his own news stories, carrying out investigations into organised crime and nuclear smuggling. In the late 90s Reeve wrote one of the first books about al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. After 9/11 the book attracted media attention and he became a commentator on American media networks, leading to his broadcasting career.",News/Environment,TV explorer Simon Reeve fears documentaries make him a climate ‘hypocrite’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/09/tv-explorer-simon-reeve-fears-documentaries-make-him-a-climate-hypocrite
1/9/2022,"Bankruptcies happen gradually, then suddenly, an Ernest Hemingway character famously deadpans in The Sun Also Rises. Yet the aftermath of insolvency can play out painfully slowly, as observers of Carillion’s collapse, four years ago this week, can testify. Carillion had its fingers in a lot of pies, to the point where it is difficult to explain what its main business was: was it construction, or something woollier like “support services”? Cleaning and maintenance are crucial to almost any business, but they are also shockingly easy to outsource to complex and faceless conglomerates. That complexity extended to accounts built on the directors’ “increasingly fantastical figures”. To borrow the Queen’s question about the credit crunch, why did nobody notice?  Carillion’s crash was so severe that it has sparked years of navel-gazing by accountants and their regulators. The latest chapter will open on Monday, when a tribunal in London will look at allegations that KPMG, a former partner at the auditor and certain current and former employees issued “false and misleading information and/or documents” to the regulator, the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). KPMG declined to comment ahead of the tribunal. KPMG self-reported the latest problems, which relate to information handed over during standard FRC inspections of audits of Carillion and Regenersis, a London-listed IT company later renamed Blancco. The regulator will not allege misconduct in the audits, nor that the financial statements were imperfectly prepared, but the tribunal will probably shine more unwelcome light on a profession that has taken a beating ever since the global financial crisis. The existence of a dominant “Big Four” is not usually a good sign in any industry. Safe to say that Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PwC have all had their scandals (try Autonomy, NMC Health, Conviviality and BHS respectively) in recent years. Smaller hangers-on such as Grant Thornton have also had their moments (Patisserie Valerie and Sports Direct). The FRC and the broader audit profession have also been in the proverbial dock in recent years. At one point there were no fewer than five separate “Whither auditing?” inquiries, and the government is close to publishing a set of reforms to audit and corporate governance that it hopes will make it much harder for balance-sheet black holes to slip past auditors unnoticed. The FRC will be replaced by a new Audit, Reporting and Governance Authority, probably in 2023. However, recent reports suggested that business lobbyists had got their claws into the reforms, watering down some more controversial elements in favour of a “business-friendly” regime fit for a wheeler-dealer post-Brexit Britain. Gone, according to the Financial Times, will be proposals to make directors personally oversee financial reporting controls; this will be demoted instead to the corporate governance code. The code sets the standards, but companies can opt out as they see fit. There are other options for seeking accountability. This week’s tribunal is one of three investigations the FRC is still running on the Carillion collapse – there is another into KPMG’s audit itself, as well as one into the company’s former directors. The government’s Official Receiver has filed a claim form suggesting that it could seek damages of as much as £1bn from KPMG for audit negligence. (KPMG has promised to contest any claim, though none has yet arrived.) Yet industry sources suggest that readers don’t hold their breath for a payout on that scale. The Carillion fallout keeps coming – but we will have to wait even longer for answers on why it happened, and how we can avoid a repeat.",News/Business,"Carillion fell quickly, but the auditing profession is now dragging its feet",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/09/carillion-fell-quickly-but-the-auditing-profession-is-now-dragging-its-feet
1/9/2022,"The government’s plans for a post-Brexit scheme to support British farming are based on little more than “blind optimism” and risk increasing the UK’s reliance on food imports, a parliamentary inquiry has warned. The EU’s scheme of subsidies – known as the common agricultural policy (CAP) and worth £3bn-a-year to UK farmers – was one of the long-running complaints of Eurosceptics, who saw the ability of Britain to draw up its own scheme of payments as one of the major benefits of Brexit. Ministers had said the new scheme would be used to increase the environmental benefits of agriculture.  However, MPs on the powerful cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) found there remained a crippling lack of detail around the environmental land management schemes (ELMs) designed to replace EU payments. They said that by the government’s own admission, “its confidence in the scheme looks like blind optimism”. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) had given no explanation of how the new scheme’s impact on English farmers would be mitigated, warning that some would see their income from direct payments reduce by more than half by 2024-25. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Tory deputy chair of PAC and a long-term Brexit supporter, said there were still “no clear plans” to replace CAP, more than five years after the EU referendum. He warned some small farms on “wafer-thin margins” could go out of business. “Farmers, especially the next generation who we will depend on to achieve our combined food production and environmental goals, have been left in the dark. It is simply wrong that Defra’s own failures of business planning should undermine the certainty crucial to a critical national sector,” he said. “The UK is also already a large net importer of food and we heard in evidence that the ELMs’ vague ambition to ‘maximise the value to society of the landscape’ may in reality mean that that increases further. The recent energy price crisis should be a salutary warning of the potential risks to the availability and affordability of food if the UK becomes even more reliant on imports.” The new scheme aims to supply “public money for public goods”, with farmers funded to restore nature, nurture the soil, improve air and water quality, and provide habitats for wildlife through ELMs. The National Farmers’ Union, however, said the report should mark a “wake-up call” for the government and said farmers had been left in an untenable position through a lack of information. “We have considerable concerns that not all farmers will be able to get involved,” said Tom Bradshaw, the union’s vice-president. “The government has still not made clear how food production fits in with its proposed new schemes. This must be addressed now, if they expect farmers to join. As the PAC highlights, we could simply end up increasing imports of food produced to lower environmental standards. “It’s crucial Defra carries out and publishes the results of impact assessments to understand the true impact of the proposed changes, something we have repeatedly asked for but has not been forthcoming.” Dustin Benton, policy director at the Green Alliance environmental thinktank, said it was not clear that the new scheme would help the government meet its own climate and nature targets. “We need ministers to say how ELMs will add up to achieving net zero carbon and restoring nature so farmers can plan their businesses,” he said. “Without this, the government’s promised green Brexit looks increasingly out of sight.” Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, said the scheme could have unintended consequences for consumers and the planet: “The big danger is that we end up with an even more divided two-tier food system, where cheaper food from abroad, with huge environmental costs, replaces food that could be grown in nature-friendly ways here.” “Working in this way is inefficient, unhelpful to UK land managers and increases the potential of perverse outcomes, such as driving increased deforestation abroad,” he said. George Eustice, the environment secretary, said: “We disagree with many of the points made by the committee which fail to take account of recent developments. Farm incomes have improved significantly since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and there will never be a better time to improve the way we reward farmers. “In December, I set out comprehensive details of the sustainable farming Incentive including full payment rates and we published an in-depth analysis of UK food security and agricultural output. In the past week we’ve shared further details of the local nature recovery and landscape recovery schemes and announced a major increase in payment rates for those farmers involved in existing agri-environment schemes.”",News/Environment,Farm subsidy plan ‘risks increasing the UK’s reliance on food imports’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/09/farm-subsidy-plan-risks-increasing-the-uks-reliance-on-food-imports

1/9/2022,"The Duchess of Cambridge has marked her 40th birthday by releasing three glamorous portraits of herself. Pictured in different Alexander McQueen dresses, Kate posed for fashion photographer Paolo Roversi, who has worked with stars such as Naomi Campbell and Kate Moss and described photographing the duchess as “a moment of pure joy”.  Roversi said the duchess could “bring hope to the whole world” with her “positive energy”. The duchess will reportedly celebrate her 40th birthday on Sunday in private with family at the Cambridges’ home in Norfolk. Roversi said: “Taking the portrait of Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge was a true honour for me and a moment of pure joy. “I was moved by her warmth and friendly welcome and enchanted by her shining eyes that reflected the loveliness of her soul and her smile showing the generosity of her heart. “It was a profound and rich experience for me, an unforgettable moment. I have met a wonderful person, a person who, with her positive energy, can bring hope to the whole world.” In the only coloured image of the series, Kate wears a red asymmetric off-shoulder McQueen dress, earrings loaned by the Queen, and an open hairstyle with loose curls while striking a casual pose with her hands seemingly in the gown’s pockets. The remaining images have been produced in monochrome. In one, a head and shoulders image, she smiles broadly while the other shows her sitting in profile and looking into the distance, with her engagement ring prominently on display against the light fabric of her dress. In both photographs, she wears earrings that belonged to Diana, Princess of Wales, PA reported. Ahead of her birthday, Kate was praised for her “vision and commitment” in establishing her Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood to support the development of children. Michael Samuel, chairman of trustees at the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, one of the country’s leading mental health charities for children and young people, commended the likely future queen for her work championing research into a child’s formative years, adding she had shown “passion and compassion” in her role as the organisation’s patron.",News/UK news,Duchess of Cambridge’s 40th birthday marked with trio of new photos ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/08/duchess-of-cambridges-40th-birthday-marked-with-trio-of-new-photos
