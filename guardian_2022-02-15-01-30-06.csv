2/15/2022,"Iremember the first time a friend told me that she had been choked without her consent during sex. I was in my early 20s, and it hadn’t been the first time for her – she had also been slapped and had her hair pulled, all by men she had met online – but I was shocked and concerned. “It’s as though he was trying to do what he has seen in porn,” she said. As our 20s progressed, my single friends came to feel that a transactional dating environment only exacerbated the problem: the men they met would watch porn, then “order” a woman on Tinder to act out what they had seen. It felt, by all accounts, mechanistic, depressing and disempowering. I write this in the midst of what is being called a backlash against sex-positive feminism. For more than a decade, millennial women have been looking back at the 90s and early 00s in which we came of age and reflecting on the all-pervasive sexist lad, porn and raunch culture, and the toxicity of the tabloids and women’s magazines. As a result, fourth-wave feminists are ambivalent about pornography and its effects, and this skepticism has coexisted quite peacefully with a desire not to shame women while deconstructing the issues we all face.  I say this because Generation Z’s discovery that porn can be damaging is making headlines: some even speak of this as though it is a backlash against millennials, despite it being no real departure from the beliefs of my generation. It’s more a rite of passage that most of us raised in the internet age have been through. Billie Eilish’s comments about porn and its damaging effects are true and righteous, but they are not new. They are the logical culmination of this feminist wave, which you could argue has been embroiled in a long, slow rebound from the postfeminism of the 1990s espoused by Generation X. Much is made of the tension between older, third-wave feminists and millennial feminists (while I realise that it isn’t always useful to divide women into generations, when it comes to waves of feminism it can be elucidating), but this always lets the 1990s postfeminists off the hook. Something I share in common with my (boomer-aged) mother is that both of us wonder what on earth these women were on. These were the women who said that feminism was over, who collaborated with the lads to bring about the heavily sexualised, objectifying, porn-influenced era we grew up in. They were the “cool girl” feminists, always one of the boys, who dismissed any attempt to critique the culture they had formed a part in creating. When we came of age and began to pull apart this hellscape, which included the women’s magazines they wrote for, they slapped us back down to protect their own interests. They could not tolerate us criticising their role in the problem. If I sound angry, I do not mean to. But having sat on the frontlines of feminist discussion before retreating due to exhaustion, exasperation and boredom, I do feel it’s important that my generation’s role in the movement is not erased. Sex-positive feminism was never about giving men a free pass to choke women in bed without their consent. It was about affording women who were sexually active, including sex workers, the respect that they had previously been denied. Look at the body of literature that is being produced by millennial women such as Sally Rooney, Megan Nolan and Raven Leilani, who are all examining rough sex, power dynamics and coercive control. Indeed, such topics are so prevalent – with good reason – that they risk becoming repetitive, but you can hardly argue that we haven’t been trying to get to the bottom of why women are being so regularly subjugated and objectified. Of course, there were Gen X feminists who critiqued porn culture at the time – Ariel Levy and Natasha Walter, for example – and women writers who were adults during that era of feminism who are skeptical of its legacy. In Katherine Angel’s brilliant Tomorrow Sex Will Be Good Again, she writes of the role that postfeminist thinking has played in so-called “consent culture”, how it demands confidence and empowerment where they may be uncertainty and ambivalence and, ironically enough, is contributing to the fact that so many women are experiencing bad sex. “Postfeminism insisted on sexual assertiveness and sex-positivity – on a gleeful pleasure taken in seeing oneself as a subject of desire,” she writes. “A woman who failed to declare her desire noisily and defiantly was falling short of her personhood. She was harking back to a fusty, frigid, feminism …” Angel frames bad sex as an important political and social issue, and, while I’m keen to stress that men can (naturally) play a significant role in bad sex, the failure of 1990s feminism should also not be forgotten. Women of my generation feel enormous solidarity with women in their late teens and 20s now, because we have been through it ourselves (though admittedly without the new horrors offered by Instagram and influencer culture). They might be surprised, given the tone of some of the media coverage (including the claims that we view them as “puriteens”), to realise that, in examining the long-term impacts of porn, they have our support. Now all we have to do work out is how to make women’s sex lives better, together.

2/15/2022,"An experienced British diplomat whose body was found almost four months after vanishing from his Hampshire home had been under “extreme stress” working on the sensitive Harry Dunn case and the Covid crisis, an inquest heard. Richard Morris, the former ambassador to Nepal, worked 15-hour shifts six or seven days a week for the Foreign Office and began to suffer from night sweats, worrying he was going to make a mistake that could land him in prison, the hearing was told.  The father-of-three, who had a distinguished 30-year career, felt he could not take more time off and instead needed to “man-up”, the inquest in Winchester heard. Morris, 52, led a team involved in the case of Harry Dunn, the teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash outside the military base RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. Anne Sacoolas, the American citizen accused of causing Dunn’s death, flew home after the crash, triggering tension between the UK and the US. Morris was then drafted on to a government Covid team.On the morning of 6 May 2020, after making his wife a cup of tea at their £1m country home in the village of Bentley, the diplomat went for a run, leaving behind his mobile phone. When he did not return, a search was launched but his body was not found until 31 August in woodland at the beauty spot Alice Holt Forest, 2.5 miles from his home. Det Insp Matthew Gillooly, of Hampshire constabulary, who led the search, admitted an error was made. On the second day, police searched the area where Morris’ body was later found and officers were just 100 metres from the spot. But they only searched two-thirds of the assigned sector – and so missed Morris. Police did not treat his death as suspicious.Morris, the ambassador to Nepal between 2015 and 2019, was due to take the position of British high commissioner to Fiji in July 2020. He was excited about the role but could not prepare for it because he was pulled into the Dunn and Covid taskforces. His wife, Alison Morris, told the inquest that her husband struggled to adjust to working in London after his return from Nepal.“The job was busy, it was full on”, she said. In January 2020, after a stressful festive period, Morris complained he had not had time off over Christmas and was not feeling well. His wife said he was told: “There’s a lot of it going around.” She added: “I think it felt to him he was being told to man up and be more resilient. I think that resilience is a core Foreign Office value. Later on he said: ‘If I’m not resilient, they will not send me to Fiji.’”He was assigned to the Covid taskforce in February 2020 and found himself working weekends and 15-hour days. His wife said that from February, he “essentially had no days leave”.She continued: “The responsibility of [Covid-19] weighed heavily on Richard and more than once I had to tell Richard he didn’t cause Covid. I can’t remember exactly when the night sweats started but they were frequent.”In late March, Morris became troubled over public travel guidance he had written. Alison Morris said: “He was extremely stressed and thought this might amount to misconduct in a public office.“The hours got longer and when working from home he didn’t have time to eat with us. He could not sit still and would not watch anything apart from Antiques Roadshow.” The inquest continues.",News/UK news,"UK diplomat found dead in woods was under ‘extreme stress’, inquest told",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/uk-diplomat-found-dead-in-woods-was-under-extreme-stress-inquest-told
2/15/2022,"The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will invoke a rare emergency law to give the federal government immense powers as he attempts to quell protests that have plunged the country into a protracted crisis. Trudeau is expected to invoke the Emergencies Act on Monday morning, according to multiple Canadian media outlets, the first time the legislation has been used.  Also on Monday, Ontario announced it would accelerate dropping its coronavirus restrictions, becoming the latest province to dramatically scale back public health measures meant to blunt the Omicron wave. Protests over those public health restrictions have for weeks paralysed the nation’s capital, halted trade and raised broader questions over the ability for police to enforce existing laws. In an indication of the deteriorating situation, Trudeau met with both his cabinet and provincial premiers on Monday morning, where he reportedly told them he would use the Emergencies Act. The law gives the government broad powers for 30 days, but Trudeau is not expected to call in the military. The law defines an emergency as a situation that “seriously endangers the lives, health or safety of Canadians and is of such proportions or nature as to exceed the capacity or authority of a province to deal with it”. In order for the law to be used, the federal government must consult with both the provinces and cabinet. There must be a belief the protesters constitute a national emergency and cannot be dealt with under existing laws. The current law replaced the War Measures Act which was used by Trudeau’s father Pierre Elliott Trudeau, who was prime minister during the “October crisis” – a period of separatist violence in Quebec, in 1970. Protesters in Ottawa have refused leave the nation’s capital, despite pleas from local, provincial and federal leaders. As they have shown an increasing brazenness in flouting the city’s laws, including setting up a hot tub near parliament, residents have taken to the streets in anger. Over the weekend, counter-protesters stopped more trucks from entering the downtown core. On Sunday, the Ottawa Citizen reported two members of Joint Task Force 2, the military’s elite special forces unit, were under investigation for their alleged involvement in the convoy protest. The city’s mayor, Jim Watson, has offered to negotiate with the leaders of the protests to remove them from residential neighbourhoods, but a deal between the city and protesters was marred by confusion after Tamara Lich, one of the protest leaders, said there was no deal, before then suggesting it was real. On Monday, a poll from the Angus Reid Institute found that nearly three-quarters of Canadians wanted the protesters to return home, suggesting waning support for the blockade that has reached an unprecedented level in Ottawa. The police’s inability to remove protesters comes in stark contrast to events in the city of Windsor over the weekend, where officers were able to clear protesters from the Ambassador Bridge. The police action ended the blockade that lasted nearly a week and halted hundreds of millions in trade between Canada and the United States. Police arrested nearly 30 people and seized 12 vehicles. With the bridge now open, pressure is mounting on federal, provincial and municipal leadership to solve the protests in Ottawa, which have entered their third week, as well as blockades at the American border in Alberta and Manitoba. Both provinces have recently scaled back their coronavirus restrictions. Ontario became the latest province to speed up its reopening after Premier Doug Ford said on Monday that the Omicron wave in the province was fading. “This is great news and a sign of just how far we’ve come together in our fight against the virus. While we aren’t out of the woods just yet, we are moving in the right direction,” he said at a press conference. Ontario will lift capacity limits on restaurants and businesses on Thursday and if the current trajectory of infections continues, will drop its vaccine passport system on 1 March. Ford said the province will keep masking rules in place for the near future.",News/World news,Trudeau to use rare emergency powers in attempt to quell protests – reports,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/canada-protests-justin-trudeau-use-rare-emergency-powers
2/15/2022,"Antarctica’s two native flowering plants are spreading rapidly as temperatures warm, according to the first study to show changes in fragile polar ecosystems have accelerated in the past decade. The increase in plants since 2009 has been greater than the previous 50 years combined, coinciding with rapidly rising air temperatures and a reduction in the number of fur seals, according to researchers working on Signy Island in the South Orkney Islands.  Populations of Antarctic hairgrass (Deschampsia antarctica) and Antarctic pearlwort (Colobanthus quitensis) have been studied by scientists on the island since 1960. Research found hairgrass spread five times faster between 2009 and 2018 than between 1960 and 2009. For pearlwort, the increase was almost ten times more, according to the paper. In the past decade, summer warming has increased from +0.02C to +0.27C each year, despite strong cooling recorded in 2012. “Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems respond quickly to these climatic inputs,” said lead researcher Prof Nicoletta Cannone, from the University of Insubria in Como, Italy. “I was expecting an increase of these plants but not of this magnitude, we are receiving multiple evidences that a major change is occurring in Antarctica.” The primary driver of change is warming summer air, according to the study, which provides one of the longest records of changes in vegetation in Antarctica. A secondary reason is there are fewer fur seals on the island, which trample on the plants. It is not known why the number of seals has declined but it is likely to be related to changes in food availability and sea conditions. Analysis shows that fur seals influenced changes from 1960 to 2009, while the main driver between 2009 and 2018 was temperature increase. Warming trends are expected to continue, with more ice-free areas created over the coming decades, and scientists say the findings from Signy Island are representative of processes happening in the region more generally. “Our findings support the hypothesis that future warming will trigger significant changes in these fragile Antarctic ecosystems,” researchers wrote in the paper, published in Current Biology. The spread of these species will cause changes in soil acidity, the bacteria and fungi in the soil, and in how organic matter decomposes. Changes in soil chemistry, as well as degradation of permafrost, will cause a cascade of changes, with “consequences on all components of terrestrial ecosystems”, said Cannone. The plants are adapted to a very short growing season and are able to photosynthesise in snowy conditions with air temperatures below 0C. Despite being able to reproduce quickly and in harsh climatic conditions, they are not good at competing with other non-native plants. Although warming may benefit some native species in isolation, it greatly increases the risk of the establishment of non-native species that could outcompete native species and trigger irreversible wildlife loss, researchers warn. In 2018, for example, an invasive grass species called Poa annua – which is often used on golf courses – colonised Signy Island. Cannone said: “The ingression of alien species can induce a dramatic loss of the native biodiversity of Antarctica which required million of years of evolution and survival. Moreover, the vegetation change will imply a domino effect on the whole biota of the terrestrial ecosystems.” During the mid-Pliocene, the Antarctic experienced warming events that allowed the spontaneous migration of species from South America to Antarctica, and the other way around. Current levels of warming could have already triggered such migrations of mosses, lichens, vascular plants and invertebrates, facilitated by human activity – namely increasing levels of tourism – in the Antarctic, scientists warn. Dr Kevin Newsham, a terrestrial ecologist at British Antarctic Survey, who was not involved in the study, said: “The study shows that further increases in populations of these plant species can be expected as Antarctica warms in future decades, leading to a greening of the region, but that there may also be increased risks to ecosystems associated with the establishment of alien plant species.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features",News/Environment,Flourishing plants show warming Antarctica undergoing ‘major change’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/14/flourishing-plants-show-warming-antarctica-undergoing-major-change-aoe
2/15/2022,"There’s an intriguing touch of Michael Haneke about this refrigerated drama from Ronny Trocker, which begins with a family walking in on burglars at their holiday home. Nothing is stolen, no one is injured; no harm done. But the intrusion disrupts their comfortable lives in ways that are hard to explain: it yanks away the blanket of privilege that keeps them warm and at ease in the world. Human Factors is a film that gets by on intelligent performances and an unnerving, tense mood. Sabine Timoteo is brilliant as Nina, the owner of an advertising agency in Germany with her husband, Jan (Mark Waschke). They have their offices in a converted warehouse, staffed by ambitious-looking millennials. Nina is the creative brains, while workaholic Jan deals with the clients. On the sly, he has agreed to run the election campaign of a controversial populist political party, which looks set to run on an anti-immigration agenda. Nina is enraged by his dishonesty and betrayal: they’ve always vowed not to touch politics.  It is Nina who is the main witness to the break-in. The couple have come away for the weekend with their two kids: sulky teenager Emma (Jule Hermann) and younger child Max (Wanja Valentin Kube). As they arrive, a door bangs upstairs and masked men thunder down the stairs into the garden. Could the incident have been staged by activists, some kind of protest against their new client? The film replays the moment of the intrusion from the perspective of each member of the family, jumping backwards and forwards in time, and the camera sticking with the character whose point of view we’re following. So it becomes like a puzzle to solve, though as time went on I wondered about the solution and if perhaps, after all, this is a film slightly lacking in ideas. The suggestion that it’s convenient to blame our problems on outsiders – personally and nationally – is interesting but doesn’t really go anywhere.

2/15/2022,"Russia’s ambassador to the EU has said Moscow would be within its rights to launch a “counterattack” if it felt it needed to protect Russian citizens living in eastern Ukraine. The comments in an interview with the Guardian will do little to calm fears of a major Russian assault on Ukraine, given one of the key scenarios suggested by western intelligence was Russia launching a “false-flag” operation to provide a pretext for invasion.  “We will not invade Ukraine unless we are provoked to do that,” said Vladimir Chizhov, who has represented Russia in Brussels since 2005. “If the Ukrainians launch an attack against Russia, you shouldn’t be surprised if we counterattack. Or, if they start blatantly killing Russian citizens anywhere – Donbas or wherever.” A 'false flag' operation is when an attack is staged in such a way that blame falls on to a different party. False flag attacks can often take the form of arson or sabotage. The objective can be to sow distrust, confusion and fear, or to provide the people secretly carrying out the acts the pretext for further action. A famous example from history is the Gleiwitz incident in 1939. An attack on a radio tower in Upper Silesia by covert German forces was publicly blamed by the Nazi authorities on Polish forces. It was then used as a false example of Polish aggression, which the Nazis claimed  justified their invasion of Poland that followed the next day, sparking the second world war. The origin of the phrase comes from the naval practice of flying a friendly flag on a ship in order to move closer to a target without raising suspicion, before attacking. Donbas is the region of eastern Ukraine where the Kremlin has armed and funded an insurgency since 2014. It has also, in recent years, handed out hundreds of thousands of Russian passports to residents of two so-called “people’s republics”, which are no longer controlled by Kyiv. More than 14,000 people have been killed in the conflict since 2014. Russia has always denied being a party to the conflict despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Chizhov described claims Russian troops were already in the Donbas region as a “lie” but warned that a sudden escalation of the conflict there, or a Ukrainian “provocation”, could precipitate action by the Kremlin. “What I mean by provocation is that they may stage an incident against the self-proclaimed Donbas republics, provoking them, and then hitting them with all their might, thus provoking Russia to react in order to avoid humanitarian catastrophe on its borders.” The US government has claimed to have evidence that Moscow is planning just the kind of provocation Chizhov said Kyiv could launch. US officials went public last month with claims they had evidence of a plan to make a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack. With an estimated 145,000 Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, intelligence officials in the US said over the weekend that Russia had accelerated plans for an invasion and could move troops across the border as soon as Wednesday. Chizhov dismissed western fears of an imminent conflict, saying the numbers of Russian troops on Ukraine’s border were only equivalent to those of the Zapad 21, a large-scale military exercise conducted last September. “And nobody said a word [then],” he said. Military analysts describe the scale and composition of the buildup as unprecedented. At a meeting with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, appeared to leave room for further negotiations. “You have said, and other Russian representatives have said, that we warn against endless conversations on issues that need to be resolved today. Still, as the foreign minister, I should say that there is always a chance,” the told the Russian president. “It seems to me that our possibilities are far from being exhausted. They certainly should not continue indefinitely. But at this stage I would suggest that they continue and be intensified,” he added. Chizhov said he believed the diplomatic blitz of recent weeks could still end in a solution that worked for all sides. The Kremlin is seeking to block Ukraine from future membership of Nato, a demand rejected by the west, as well as to begin a discussion on a new security architecture for Europe. Chizhov said the west had a “selective type of memory” about previous commitments on Nato enlargement. He added that Lavrov had written to EU and Nato countries on 1 February citing the OSCE summit in Istanbul in November 1999 where it was agreed that all were obliged “not to strengthen its security at the expense of the security of other states”. The EU’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, has responded in a letter seen by the Guardian, in which he said: “We in the European Union are prepared to continue dialogue with Russia on ways to strengthen the security of all.” Chizhov said he was not able to make Borrell’s letter public but that his general assessment was that it was “unsatisfactory”. He added that it was also surprising, given that Borrell had not been a recipient of Lavrov’s communication. “We wanted to sound out each and every country,” Chizhov said. “Well, they were too timid to reply in their national capacity”.",News/World news,Russian envoy warns of right to counterattack in eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/14/russian-envoy-warns-of-right-to-counterattack-in-eastern-ukraine
2/15/2022,"As the confetti fell at SoFi Stadium, Odell Beckham stood alone amid the revelry, eyes welling, hands on his head in disbelief. No sooner than the dazed receiver appeared on the stadium’s massive video screen did the Los Angeles Rams partisans, in slight majority among the 70,048 attendees, loose a deafening roar. To find their common emotional trigger, one needn’t have looked further than the message writ large on Beckham’s matching hat and T-shirt: Super Bowl Champions. Nothing gets LA in a froth like a big sparkly prize. On Sunday the Rams’ 23-20 dismissal of the upstart Cincinnati Bengals was recognized with a Lombardi trophy, the second Super Bowl crown in the franchise’s 86-year history. It was a capstone achievement that was realised in Los Angeles, on the Rams’ home turf, with more A-listers in attendance than at most recent award shows. There was the Rock, Cardi B, Bennifer – and those sightings all came before the Grammy-grade halftime show.  So it was fitting that it was the Rams’ stars who delivered the Hollywood ending that was every bit as sappy as the one in American Underdog – an actual film about the Rams that was released this year. Even game MVP Cooper Cupp’s acceptance speech was note-perfect. “I just feel so undeserving,” he said in an emotional postgame news conference while thanking his high school sweetheart Anna Croskrey for the years of support and sacrifice that helped him to this career pinnacle – the greatest season by a receiver since the immortal Jerry Rice. Beckham set the tone during the game; facing third and three from the Bengals’ 17-yard line, he quickly manoeuvred from the inside of the Rams spread formation and caught a fade pass over Cincinnati’s Mike Hilton in the right corner of the endzone to stake Los Angeles to a 7-0 lead. He celebrated in the endzone with a moonwalk. Another third-down reception in the second quarter for 35 yards set up an 11-yard Kupp TD catch that extended the Rams’ lead to 13-3. Beckham was a a bargain bin signee added to the Rams roster at midseason, and he appeared well on his way to an MVP night. But then late in the second quarter, while reaching for a shallow pass, he fell to the ground clutching his left knee and had to be helped off the field, never to return to action. And without their X-factor or much of a run game to keep Cincinnati’s ferocious defensive front honest, LA struggled to move the chains, and Matthew Stafford got desperate. Facing third and 14 from the Cincinnati 43 yard line, Stafford forced an end-zone to Van Jefferson that was intercepted by Jessie Bates III. Thanks to the blunders, the Bengals rallied to a 20-13 third-quarter lead. On the Rams’ first possession of the third quarter Stafford bounced a ball off Ben Skowronek that was picked off by Chidobe Awuzie. The next time the Rams had the ball Stafford went out for a pass, echoing the Bengals’ “Chilli Special” scoring play earlier in the game, but couldn’t gather the throw from Kupp. It was enough to make you wonder: Is this what the Rams traded away Jared Goff and all those draft picks for – to take the ball out of Stafford’s hands? With the whiff of defeat in the air as thick as the stench of marijuana in the SoFi’s upper bowl, Aaron Donald seized control. After the second Stafford interception, the Rams’ all-world defensive stalwart dropped Joe Burrow twice; the second sack helped hold the Bengals to a field goal. It wasn’t until late in the fourth quarter that the Rams offence shook off the loss of Beckham and started forcing the ball to Kupp – the Rams’ true No1 receiver. With time ticking away and Stafford struggling to connect with Van Jefferson (who may have been distracted by his wife going into labour during the game), Kupp carried a fourth-down handoff seven yards and caught four balls for 39 more yards, not least a one-yard back-shoulder touchdown against the Bengals’ Eli Apple to nudge the Rams back in front for good. When Cincinnati seemed as if they’d drive for the win with 1:25 left, Donald hurried Burrow into a fourth-down incompletion that gave the Rams the ball back with 43 seconds left. After a Stafford kneel down, the most exclusive party in sports was on. Altogether, the Rams sacked the Bengals QB a Super Bowl record seven times. “Our best players stepped up in the most crucial and critical moments,” said LA’s Sean McVay, validating his status as the NFL’s ‘It’ coach. “When you look at the way the second half started, a lot of teams would’ve folded.” Of course this being an LA story – a 20-year reunion, of sorts – there’s no telling how long this happy ending will last. After all, this vibrant, thrumming moment of SoFi Stadium bliss wouldn’t have been possible without the Rams mortgaging their future to redeem their Super Bowl defeat against New England just three years ago. The tags were barely off the Rams’ Super Bowl gear before speculation raged about whether Donald, Miller and Beckham will return for the title defence. Even the 36-year-old McVay, who displaced Mike Tomlin as the youngest Super Bowl-winning coach, has been frank about not wanting to be in this business in his 60s. This championship seems less like one for the ages than yet another piece of Tinseltown ephemera, something to savour in the moment – like, well, the Lakers’ 2020 NBA title run. But not all the Rams’ stars are flashy blow-ins, brought in through costly expenditures. “I promised my daughter this when she was five-years-old,” said the 30-year-old Donald, like Kupp a homegrown cornerstone acquired through the draft. “She got to play in confetti? I’m going to enjoy this with my teammates, my family. I’m just going to enjoy this for today, a couple days.” It’s quite conceivable that in a year’s time few in his ever-changing city will remember who won Super Bowl LVI. But for one night at least it was a blockbuster entirely of the Rams’ making, one that wouldn’t have been possible had their brightest stars not aligned.",Sport/Sport,LA story: in the Rams’ blockbuster victory it was their stars who shone,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/14/los-angeles-rams-super-bowl-lvi-victory-nfl-football
2/15/2022,"The prime minister’s pledge to scrap legally enforced isolation for people in England with Covid-19 flies in the face of basic infectious disease management, which tells us to avoid infecting other people when you are infectious. It is a basic public health protection, like others we have in daily life: speed limits on roads, the banning of smoking indoors, and laws against drink driving. These limit our freedoms to a certain extent, but we have accepted that “infringement” in order to have a safer and healthier society. I agree that we need to get back to “normality” but it’s a question of timing, and now isn’t the right time.  Governments across the world are facing the same difficult questions with Covid-19. While vaccines and therapeutics have largely defanged Covid-19, the disease can still have a nasty bite, especially for those who are unvaccinated or vulnerable or elderly. Even for those with three vaccines who manage the disease at home, Omicron can leave people with fatigue, struggling with their normal activities and needing weeks to recover. At the same time, suppression has become increasingly difficult and elimination almost impossible, given Omicron’s infectiousness: South Korea has abandoned its test-and-trace system due to the difficulty of tracking chains of infection that were moving faster than their world-leading tracing systems could run. Asking people to continue to limit their social mixing, work from home and avoid activities they might enjoy such as singing in church or going to the pub once a week is increasingly difficult for governments. Humans are social – interacting and being in close physical contact is part of a meaningful life for many people. Governments are also dealing with the longer-term buildup of harms that come with extensive restrictions, such as rising unemployment, mental health issues (in younger people particularly), increased educational inequalities and the desertion of city centres. We all want our pre-Covid-19 lives back: the question is what the cost of this is. That’s the debate we should be having as a society, without avoiding the difficult realities of the situation. The UK has faced an average of 200 deaths a day now for weeks, while the US is heading towards the million death mark. The media no longer report these deaths widely, as they did at the start of the pandemic: there seems to be a certain acceptance of this as the cost of somewhat normal life to continue. The morality of that is questionable. It is similar to how other diseases such as measles, malaria and childhood pneumonia have been approached. In 2018, measles killed more than 140,000 people worldwide, largely children under five. These deaths could have been prevented through vaccination. In 2018, malaria killed more than 411,000 people, most of them babies and toddlers. These deaths could have been largely prevented through antimalarial treatment. In 2018, more than 800,000 children, largely under five, died of pneumonia, making it the biggest infectious killer. These could have been largely prevented through provision of oxygen and antibiotics. We know how to prevent the bulk of child deaths across the world, we just don’t have the political will or investment to make it happen. The difference in attention to Covid-19 deaths is that this is killing people in rich countries, not just in poor ones. And again we know how to prevent the bulk of Covid-19 deaths using vaccinations and boosters, rolling out new antiviral therapies and continuing to ensure that testing is available to enable those who are infectious to isolate and avoid infecting those who could be at risk of serious disease.Isolation could possibly be removed at some point in the future, starting with children, but instead of moving cautiously with an uncertain future, the prime minister is accelerating in the “race to get back to normal”, as if countries are in a competition to who can leave the Covid-19 pandemic behind first. It’s easy to forget that we are still learning and making policy in real time with considerable uncertainty over the coming months. There are three major unknowns that worry scientists as we look ahead into the future. The first is about waning immunity and how long protection from vaccines or infection will last, especially for those more susceptible to severe illness from Covid-19. Again this is science in real time: we will know about waning immunity when patients start appearing in hospitals and we can collect enough data from enough people on their vaccination date and status and health outcomes. Learning from other countries is vital here. Next is the question of long-term impacts of the virus on the body: a new study from the US shows that even a mild bout of Covid-19 increased the risk of heart failure by 72% and of stroke by 52% for at least a year after diagnosis. We still don’t fully understand what the impacts of getting Covid-19 are on the heart, lungs, blood vessels or brain, once or repeatedly. This means that resigning people to get Covid-19 several times could possibly have major consequences in the years to come. The third is about what new variants might emerge and how that might affect the next phase of the pandemic. New variants may not necessarily be milder: there is a certain unpredictability about what might come next. Managing Covid-19 is not an easy feat, and it is fantastic that restrictions have largely been released for us to continue with normal life. Children particularly should be able to mix with their friends and enjoy as much normality as possible. But releasing isolation right now, given the uncertainty ahead and the death toll, is irresponsible. If we’ve learned anything from the past two months, slow and steady is the best way to stay ahead of Covid-19.

2/15/2022,"The cost of travelling on London’s tube and bus network will rise by almost 5% from next month, the biggest increase in more than a decade, as the body responsible for running the capital’s transport network struggles to plug a funding shortfall. The average 4.8% rise, which matches the rate of inflation, means that most fares will increase by between 10p and 20p. However, some bus fares will rise by 6.5%.  It is the second year running that fares have increased, a situation the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, blamed on the row over the level of government funding for Transport for London (TfL), with the proportionate increase in tube prices the biggest since 2010, and the largest since 2009 on the bus network. “Since TfL’s finances were decimated by the pandemic, the government has set strict conditions as part of the emergency funding deals to keep essential transport services running in London,” Khan said. “We have been forced into this position by the government and the way it continues to refuse to properly fund TfL.” Khan, who had kept a partial fare freeze across the TfL network from his election as London mayor in 2016 until 2020, said he had done “everything in my power to keep fares as affordable as possible”. Emma Gibson, the chief executive of the passenger watchdog London TravelWatch, said: “Many key workers and those on low incomes rely solely on the bus, as they can’t afford the tube or train, and they will be hit hardest by this rise.” TfL, which Khan chairs, faces a deadline this Friday to hammer out a long-term funding arrangement with the government. TfL’s finances have been hit heavily by the pandemic as commuters and holidaymakers stopped travelling. The situation has been exacerbated by the government’s plans to force the organisation to make efficiency savings to ultimately reach “financial sustainability”. Before the pandemic, about 70% of TfL’s income came directly from fares, with grant income worth £700m a year from central government phased out between 2015 and 2019. The RMT union said this month that tube workers are to go on strike on 1 and 3 March over fears for jobs, pensions and working conditions. The Department for Transport said it had provided £4.5bn in emergency funding to TfL to help weather the pandemic, as well as pledging £1bn annually for capital investment annually until at least 2024-25, “all at a time of significant pressure on the national finances”. “We’re aware that TfL are still feeling the after-effects of the pandemic but it is the mayor’s responsibility to accelerate overdue reforms that will ensure TfL becomes financially sustainable,” said a spokesperson for the department.",News/UK news,London tube and bus fares to rise almost 5% from next month,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/london-tube-and-bus-fares-to-rise-almost-5-from-next-month
2/15/2022,"Bel-Air is a reboot with its own remarkable origin story. In 2019, the independent film-maker Morgan Cooper had the audacity to make a trailer for an imaginary new version of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, reshaping the 1990s sitcom as a tough, Ryan Coogler-style drama. Cooper might have dreamed that the clip would go viral and that the show would actually be made, with him still on board directing episode one. That’s happened, but this is a fairytale with a sad ending. The new Bel-Air (Peacock/Sky/NOW) is confused and joyless, a remake without a reason to exist. Another kid called Will Smith moves hastily to LA to live with his rich aunt, uncle and cousins after an incident on a west Philadelphia basketball court. That run-in with the neighbourhood bad guys is much graver than the one the previous incarnation of Will experienced – involving guns and the threat of jail time – and when Will gets to Bel-Air, everyone there is a serious operator, too.  Uncle Phil is now a focused, muscly lawyer with ambitions to be elected district attorney, and a own a colossal mansion rather than just a nice house. Aunt Viv is an artist and elegant socialite. Cousin Hilary is an Instagram influencer, because apparently there’s a law now that says someone in every new show has to be, while her brother Carlton has undergone the most profound change: instead of the preppy buffoon of old, he’s a pseudo-Shakespearean vortex of toxic pride and fractured self-image who is to be Will’s nemesis. Since Bel-Air has chosen to retain the premise, character names and some of the title of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, it invites comparisons. Such comparisons are not to its benefit. One of the countless magical properties of the sitcom format is that it has a particular ability to create moving dramatic moments, because viewers are wrongfooted when the clown mask suddenly drops: the Fresh Prince episode where Will and Carlton find themselves the victims of racist policing, for instance, or the one where Will’s neglectful father reappears and then abandons his son again, have extra power because they sneak up in the cloak of a gag-filled comedy. With an hour an episode and no jokes to make, Bel-Air has all the time in the world to fashion drama about race, class and coming-of-age, but it ends up being less layered and guileful than its source material. The limited characterisation that doesn’t necessarily matter in a comedy, but does in a straight drama, is no more detailed than in the original Fresh Prince. Take Will himself, whose insistence on maintaining his Philly smarts was fuel for a thousand funny comebacks when he was a sitcom protagonist: as played by the restless Jabari Banks, the new Will’s refusal to adapt to his surroundings – a cliched fantasy of walk-in closets, Lexuses and neon-lit pool parties – turns him into an annoying caricature of stubborn teen ingratitude, ranged against Uncle Phil (Adrian Holmes) as a stiff scold who constantly goes on about how Will’s behaviour will affect “my campaign”. The drama’s grandest aim is to take the idea of a privileged family looking after their disadvantaged relative, and use it to examine the guilt of the black upper-middle class. But because the scripts can never resist going down the easiest route, the show’s handling of racial politics seems rudimentary – particularly when held next to recent series that have covered similar ground, such as Dear White People, She’s Gotta Have It or Black-ish. A scene where Will is angered by a white student saying the N-word, and another where Hilary is offered a magazine job on the condition that she tone down her blackness, are both undermined by how starkly they’re set up and how readily the correct answer is arrived at. Of course these are still live issues and any reminder of them is valuable, but where the aforementioned recent shows felt as if they were pushing the discourse forwards and creating challenging drama into the bargain, Bel-Air does neither. Perhaps it wants to hit a younger demographic, as shown by the way episode two trots out the familiar plots of a standard high-school drama. But that’s unlikely to work either: trivial storylines such as Will trying out for the basketball team jar with the show’s monotonous intensity, which demands that everything everyone says is a self-aggrandising speech or a vicious telling-off. Coco Jones as the funny, energised Hilary offers some respite, but not much. Once upon a time, Will from west Philly was miles from home, but the show he was in knew exactly what it was and where it was going. Bel-Air finds that a difficult trick to replicate.",Arts/Television & radio,"Bel-Air review – this confused, joyless Fresh Prince remake has no reason to exist ",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/14/bel-air-review-this-confused-joyless-fresh-prince-remake-has-no-reason-to-exist-peacock
2/15/2022,"Activists fronting a new campaign masterminded by Roger Hallam, the strategist behind Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain, have said they are now preparing to move beyond protest and “into civil resistance”. Two young supporters of Just Stop Oil went to Downing Street on Monday morning, where they delivered an ultimatum to ministers calling for an immediate end to new fossil fuel investments.  “If you do not provide such assurance by 14 March 2022 it will be our duty to intervene – to prevent the ultimate crime against our country, humanity and life on earth,” said the letter, read out at the gates and delivered by hand. The Guardian understands that the intention is to take direct action against Britain’s oil infrastructure – from petrol stations to fuel depots and refineries. In a brief speech to reporters, Louis McKechnie, 21, who was recently released from jail for taking part in court injunction-breaking road blockades with Insulate Britain, said: “We know what needs to be done, it’s simple, just stop oil. Right now they are doing the opposite.” For weeks Hallam and other supporters of the campaign, seen as a successor to Insulate Britain, have been touring universities calling on students to sign up. Unlike Insulate Britain, which was predominantly composed of older activists, including several over 70, Just Stop Oil is intended as a youth-led campaign. Hallam told students at Glasgow University last month they “had to become revolutionaries” to avert climate disaster. The Guardian understands that hundreds of activists have signed up and said they were willing to be arrested as part of the campaign. Jess Causby, 25, a supporter of the campaign, said it would involve an escalation of tactics compared with recent environmental protests. “Just Stop Oil has seen that if we want to really protect ourselves and everything around us then we need to move beyond this protest stuff which people have been doing with Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain, and then we need to move forward into civil resistance,” Causby said. “What that actually means is stopping pointing out what the government should or shouldn’t be doing [and instead] actively stopping government doing what they shouldn’t be.” Causby said the campaign had taken inspiration from fuel protests 22 years ago, when hauliers used lorries to blockade oil refineries and fuel depots. She said: “We have been demanding [action on climate change] for years now and we’re continuously disappointed with their empty promises and lack of action. So now we’re taking it into our own hands and we’re going to stop them because we have no choice.” Activists from the campaign were giving about 20 to 30 talks a week, Causby said.

2/15/2022,"The Royal Statistical Society published the results of an interesting survey of MPs last week, having asked 101 of the people who make our laws a fairly basic question about probability: if you toss the same coin twice, what are the chances that it will be heads both times? Forty-eight per cent of them got it wrong.  To be fair to our current crop of MPs, that was an improvement on the result when the society conducted a similar survey a decade ago and 40% got it right. The performance of Labour MPs has definitely improved, from 23% getting it right 10 years ago to 53% – 1% in front of the Tories – this time around. But even so, the results reflect quite poorly on the basic numeracy of our elected representatives. It would be interesting to see the results if 101 racing punters were asked to calculate the return on a £10 win double on two even-money shots, which is a different way of phrasing exactly the same question. This is, of course, pure speculation, but my money would be on rather more than 52% of the punters knowing that the double is 3-1 against, and that they would be looking at £40 back. But it is the MPs, a fair chunk of whom apparently lack even the faintest grasp of chance and probability, who will soon be considering, amending and ultimately approving a new Gambling Act, which will determine how and even, in some scenarios, whether the rest of us can continue to bet on racing and other sports as we choose.

And how can they even begin to consider the possible consequences, unintended or otherwise, of lumping it all together and treating it all as “just gambling”? As Stian Westlake, the RSS’s chief executive, pointed out when the results of the survey were published, “statistical skills are vital for good decision-making and effective scrutiny. While we’re pleased to see that it looks like MPs’ knowledge in this area has improved, the survey results highlight that more needs to be done to ensure our elected representatives have the statistical skills needed for the job.” A grasp of probability and chance is one of those essential statistical skills Westlake mentions and if parliament is any reflection of the country as a whole it is an issue for a significant proportion of the general population. It is also a skill punters tend to acquire over time, often without even realising.

But gamblers often seemed to be ignored, or dismissed as an irrelevance, in debates around the forthcoming legislation, which could have huge implications for racing’s revenue stream from betting. It seems likely many punters have a stronger grasp of chance than the MPs, which hardly increases confidence that the next Gambling Act will be any less of a poorly thought-out mess than the last one.",Sport/Sport,Talking Horses: new Gambling Act in danger of miscalculating the stakes,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/14/talking-horses-new-gambling-act-in-danger-of-miscalculating-the-stakes
