3/21/2022,"By Abdelaziz Boumzar and Marko Djurica BROVARY, Ukraine (Reuters) - Three U.S. volunteer fighters who have risked their lives alongside Ukrainian soldiers said they had joined the struggle against Russian forces to stop civilians suffering and in the name of freedom. The group, including a female college student from New York who works at JFK airport, spoke of their narrow escape after they said the vehicle they were travelling in hit a land mine on Sunday on the frontline near the capital Kyiv. Reuters could not independently verify the identity of the three foreign fighters nor their description of the incident. A Ukrainian combatant who was with the three at the time was being treated at Brovary Hospital on the outskirts of the capital after suffering serious injuries. ""We thought he was dead, he was slumped over and unresponsive,"" Alexis Antilla, who was acting as a combat medic for the team of fighters and was herself injured in the explosion, told Reuters at the hospital. ""When the fire started to consume him, he started to wake up and we were able to get him out,"" she said. Speaking a couple of hours after the incident, Antilla said a second landmine exploded shortly after the first, sending rounds of ammunition that the group was carrying flying past their heads. Despite the close encounter with death, she said she wanted to return to the frontline as soon as her injuries healed. ""I felt a calling to come here, I felt like it was the right thing to do, I feel like what's happening here, what Putin is doing, is evil,"" she said. ""There is no need to put millions and millions of people through the suffering and torment that they are going through, and I felt I had to be here to help in any way that I could."" Red Taylor, from Tennessee, said that the Ukrainian with them spoke good English and spotted the landmine but that the group ""could not even count a second between the time he said there are landmines everywhere and the 'boom'"". Their commander, who only gave his name as Rob and said he was from Connecticut, has been fighting in Ukraine for three weeks. ""I don't like what they are doing to the civilians and what they are doing to all these people. My boys and me feel the same. There has to be justice in this world for people that want to live free, and that's what we fight for,"" he said. Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, calling it a ""special operation"" to demilitarize Ukraine and capture nationalists. While Ukraine's armed forces are heavily outnumbered, they have mounted significant resistance. Ukraine has also established an international legion for people from abroad, and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has publicly urged foreigners to come and fight side-by-side with Ukrainians against the Russians, whom he describes as ""war criminals"". Zelenskiy has said that more than 16,000 foreigners have volunteered, without specifying how many had arrived.

3/21/2022,"When Henry Hoeft decided to join the foreign legion in Ukraine, he pitched his local newspaper on the story. The result for the 28-year-old was a PR coup: A glowing front-page profile in the Columbus Dispatch. The piece described him, appealingly, as “as a former infantryman in the U.S. Army and half-Ukrainian on his father’s side.” And it enabled Hoeft to pose as an important actor on the global stage: “We feel like if we can hold Putin for long enough,” Hoeft told the reporter, “we can possibly stop a world war.” More from Rolling Stone Zelensky 'Ready' to Negotiate with Putin, But Warns of 'Third World War' if Talks Collapse Ukrainian Band Closes SXSW With Bold Protest, Bob Dylan's 'Masters of War' Ukrainian Punk Band Rerecords the Clash Classic as 'Kyiv Calling': 'A Symbol of Solidarity and Hope' Hoeft insisted that he was committed to the cause: “I will be there for as long as it takes.” And the Dispatch played up his personal sacrifice, quoting him as saying, “This is who I am.” The publicity helped Hoeft raise at least $5,000 on GiveSendGo (the Christian fundraising alternative GoFundMe) to fund his foreign escapade. But the noble narrative about standing up to Russian aggression concealed a darker tale, as the true story of Hoeft’s identity is far more complicated, and far less pleasant. Hoeft has deep ties to the militant Boogaloo Bois movement, which seeks to spark violent unrest. And his now infamous misadventure in Ukraine offers a cautionary tale about lionizing Americans who are pulling up stakes and seeking to insert themselves into a war zone. Hoeft is known by the alias Henry Locke among the Boogaloo Bois, a loosely organized, heavily armed revolutionary movement that expresses its violent aims through an ironic filter. The name derives from the oft-memed 1980s break-dancing movie sequel Breakin II: Electric Boogaloo. According to the Justice Department, “The term ‘Boogaloo’ itself references an impending second civil war in the United States and is associated with violent uprisings against the government.” Hoeft’s well documented Boogaloo background isn’t the only strike against his character. Far from staying in Ukraine to the bitter end, as he vowed, Hoeft has already gone viral for a video announcing his decision to cut and run. In the clip, he makes dire allegations, including that his life was threatened for deciding to leave, and that he had to masquerade as an aid worker to make it back across the border into Poland. “We had to get the fuck out of there,” Hoeft says in the video. “People need to stop fucking coming here. It’s a trap and they’re not letting you leave.” Hoeft’s claims are already being circulated as propaganda for the Russian side; a prominent extremism researcher has tracked the video across forums on Telegram and the Russian social media platform VK that use Hoeft’s claims to mock foreign fighters in Ukraine. His video has also been blasted as disinformation by one erstwhile brothers in arms, who called the video “100 percent completely false” and the product of Hoeft’s bitterness at failing a vetting process to join the fight. Hoeft could not be reached for this story. The TikTok account he’d been using to document his journey to Ukraine is now defunct. A Twitter handle previously linked to him, @HenryLocke16, is suspended. He did not respond to an interview request via Facebook. A message left through a GoFundMe he appears to have launched in 2021 while he said he was recovering from a gunshot was not returned. Internet researchers who document extremists have tracked Hoeft for years, pulling alarming images allegedly from his social media feeds, as well as from local police scanners. How did the Dispatch miss Hoeft’s extremism? According to a top editor, the paper’s due diligence, which included a criminal background check, simply failed to turn up his alias. The irony is that the Dispatch, itself, had quoted and photographed Hoeft — going by Henry Locke — at a heavily armed Boogaloo Bois “unity” rally at the Ohio state capitol in Columbus in January 2021, just a few days after the assault on the U.S. Capitol where several Bois were arrested. Reportedly an organizer of the Columbus protest — which was countered by the presence of state police and the national guard — Hoeft sported an assault rifle, and a cache of high-capacity magazines. The Boogaloo Bois’ flavor of libertarian, anti-law-enforcement anarchism can be hard to peg on the left-right political spectrum. And as if to heighten the cognitive dissonance, Boogaloos mark themselves flamboyant Hawaiian floral prints. (Hoeft wore a floral covid mask at the statehouse protest.) The movement’s goofy symbols belie dark beliefs. The Southern Poverty Law Center has traced racist origins of the “boogaloo” coinage — noting that the term “is regularly deployed by white nationalists and neo-Nazis who want to see society descend into chaos so that they can come to power and build a new fascist state” — though SPLC cautions that the wider Boogaloo Boy movement is “not exclusively premised on pursuing white supremacist ideas.” The Dispatch awkwardly retconned its profile to weave in mentions of Hoeft’s Booglaoo links. And the piece continued to offer the militant the benefit of the doubt, quoting Hoeft as saying he’d distanced himself from the extremist movement. Lark-Marie Anton, a spokesperson for the newspaper’s parent company Gannet, said in a written statement: “We regret the error and immediately revised the story to reflect that Henry Hoeft previously used the name Henry Locke and has been associated with the far-right group known as the Boogaloo Bois in the past.” But there’s reason to question Hoeft’s alleged turn away from extremism. Hoeft traveled to Eastern Europe with prominent leader of the Boogaloo Bois movement, Mike Dunn, a gun-rights militant from Virginia, whose habit of openly defying the state’s gun laws got him featured by Vice. (Dunn did not respond to an interview request.) Dunn has become a controversial figure in the Boogaloo movement because he allegedly reported a fellow extremist, David Phillips, to federal law enforcement. But Dunn was interviewed on video by an independent journalist shortly before his departure for Ukraine, and he insisted that taking up arms against the Russians “is in the spirit of the Boogaloo movement and embodies those ideals.” Speaking of his fellow travelers, Dunn added that “the Boogaloo movement is going to be represented over there by individuals who have given more to the movement than anybody crying online has” — a dig at those he Boogaloos he said who aren’t “willing to give up their life for their rights, they’ve just been posting online.” For Hoeft, the excitement of arriving in Ukraine was almost immediately undermined by the harsh realities of joining under-funded foreign fighters. In his viral video Hoeft said he’d tried to hook up with Georgia National Legion, a group of foreigners on the Ukrainian side largely made up of fighters from the country of Georgia. But Hoeft said they didn’t have much to arm new recruits with: “They’re tying to send us to Kiev with no fucking weapons, no kit, no fucking plates,” he said. “The people who are lucky enough to get weapons are only getting magazines with like 10 fucking rounds.” When his group of fighters refused their deployment, Hoeft alleged, “they told us we had to get the fuck out or they were going to shoot us in the back.” Hoeft then claimed he “fucking hid in the back of an ambulance” to get a ride to border, where he alleged that Ukrainian authorities at the crossing to Poland were intercepting fighting aged men and were “cuttin’ up passports” and “sending you back to the front.” Hoeft alleged he was bailed out by a humanitarian group that helped camouflage him as medical staff. “We got in, like, Red Cross vests and they had like fucking humanitiarian passes to get us through the Ukranian border,” he said, warning other’s not to come, because, “it’s a trap.” It’s unclear what platform Hoeft originally used to post the video, but it was soon grabbed by Twitter accounts that saw Hoeft’s message as favorable to the Russian side: “It’s a trap, they’re cutting up our passports and sending us to the front”.

Dunn appears haggard in the clip. “You have to excuse me, I’m pretty sick right now. But I am alive,” he says. “I’ve been in and out of Ukraine twice in the last three or four days…. I’m with a local militia unit. I’ve had no issues with my passport being torn up.” Dunn said he also tried to hook up with the Georgian fighting unit, and insisted he’d never felt in danger. “The Georgia National Legion never threatened to kill me or harm me in any shape form or fashion,” he said. “I can’t illegitimitize [sic] Henry’s story 1,000 percent, but I can say from my own perspective that it didn’t happen to me.” For his part, Dunn revealed that he’d been rejected from that unit. “They were not fond at all of people with an Internet existence,” Dunn said. “Obviously, I have an extensive Internet existence… and I left the Georgia Legion about two days before Henry did.” The Virginia militant had harsh words for Hoeft. “I will not call it cowardice, but I will say that none of the stuff he described in the video happened to me. Obviously, his (video) is going to be used as anti-Ukrainian propaganda, which I am not for.” Dunn added, “I’m still here in Ukraine,” but clarified that he now expected to leave within a month. Adding to this fog of war videos, another American on the ground in Ukraine, Harrison Jozefowicz, a former Chicago cop who claims to be with “a humanitarian organization” working directly with Georgian Legion, released a pair of videos calling Hoeft’s claims “completely false.” He blamed Hoeft’s tale of cut up passports on “mass paranoia.” “We have a vetting process,” he said. “Henry Locke… did not pass our vetting process.” Jozefowicz characterized Hoeft’s viral video as “direct retaliation” for “being rejected.” But he insisted: “That’s exactly why we have a vetting process — to stop those kind of mindset people from getting here.” For those who analyze extremism professionally, the misadventures of two Boogaloo Bois in Ukraine fit into a broader, more troubling framework, in which international conflict zones attract exactly the wrong type of people. “Hoeft and Dunn underscore the problem of extremists joining the larger populations of volunteers,” writes Rita Katz Director of SITE Intelligence Group. “The world is pulling for Ukraine,” she adds, “but a free flow of unvetted extremist militants into a conflict always creates problems beyond one country.” Best of Rolling Stone Every Super Bowl Halftime Show, Ranked From Worst to Best 5 Festivals That Ended in Disaster Muhammad Ali: 4 Ways He Changed America Click here to read the full article.

3/21/2022,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Lagging behind Russia in developing hypersonic weapons, the U.S. Navy is rushing to field its first, with installation on a warship starting as soon as late next year. The United States is in a race with Russia and China to develop these weapons, which travel at speeds akin to ballistic missiles but are difficult to shoot down because of their maneuverability. The Russian military says it already deployed hypersonic missiles, claiming on both Saturday and Sunday to have deployed them against targets in Ukraine marking the weapon's first use in combat. The Pentagon couldn’t confirm a hypersonic weapon was used in the attacks. The American military is accelerating development to catch up. The U.S. weapon would launch like a ballistic missile and would release a hypersonic glide vehicle that would reach speeds seven to eight times faster than the speed of sound before hitting the target. In Maine, General Dynamics subsidiary Bath Iron Works has begun engineering and design work on changes necessary to install the weapon system on three Zumwalt-class destroyers. The work would begin at a yet-to-be-named shipyard sometime in fiscal year that begins in October 2023, the Navy said. Hypersonic weapons are defined as anything traveling beyond Mach 5, or five times faster than the speed of sound. That's about 3,800 mph (6,100 kph). Intercontinental ballistic missiles far exceed that threshold but travel in a predictable path, making it possible to intercept them. The new weapons are maneuverable. Existing missile defense systems, including the Navy’s Aegis system, would have trouble intercepting such objects because maneuverability makes their movement unpredictable and speed leaves little time to react. Russia says it has ballistic missiles that can deploy hypersonic glide vehicles as well as a hypersonic cruise missile. The U.S. is “straining just to catch up” because it failed to invest in the new technology, with only a fraction of the 10,000 people who were working on the program in the 1980s, said U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper, a Tennessee Democrat who's chair of a subcommittee that monitors the program. “If we want to pursue parity, we will need to back this effort with more money, time, and talent than we are now,” he said. The Russian invasion of Ukraine serves as a backdrop as the Pentagon releases its budget proposal that lays out its goals for hypersonics and other weapon systems later this month. The three stealthy Zumwalt-class destroyers to be equipped with the new weapons have plenty of space to accommodate them — thanks to a design failure that works to the Navy’s advantage in this instance. The ships were built around a gun system that was supposed to use GPS-guided, rocket-boosted projectiles to pound targets 90 miles (145 kilometers) away. But those projectiles proved to be too expensive, and the Navy canceled the system, leaving each of the ships with a useless loading system and a pair of 155-mm guns hidden in angular turrets. The retrofit of all three ships will likely cost more than $1 billion but will give a new capability to the tech-laden, electric-drive ships that already cost the Navy $23.5 billion to design and build, said Bryan Clark, a defense analyst at the Hudson Institute. “The engineering is not that hard. It’ll just take time and money to make it happen,” Clark said. The Navy intends to field the weapons on the destroyers in the 2025 fiscal year and on Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines in the 2028 fiscal year, the Navy said. The destroyers would be based in the Pacific Ocean, where they would be a deterrent to China, should it become emboldened by Russia's attack on Ukraine and consider attacking Taiwan, Clark said. The U.S. focus on hypersonic weapons represents a pivot after hesitating in the past because of technological hurdles. Adversaries, meanwhile, continued research and development. Russia fired off a salvo of Zircon hypersonic cruise missiles in late December, heralding the completion of weapon testing. But Russia may be exaggerating the capability of such super weapons to compensate for weakness in other areas, said Loren Thompson, a defense analyst at the Lexington Institute. For the time being, Russia doesn't have many of the weapons, and it's unclear how effective they are, he said.",World/Associated Press,Ukraine war is backdrop in US push for hypersonic weapons,https://news.yahoo.com/ukraine-war-backdrop-us-push-113007790.html
3/21/2022,"(Corrects spelling of ""suspicions"" in second paragraph) SHANGHAI, March 20 (Reuters) - China stands on the right side of history over the Ukraine crisis as time will tell, and its position is in line with the wishes of most countries, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. ""China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicions against China,"" Wang told reporters on Saturday evening, according to a statement published by his ministry on Sunday. Wang's comments came after U.S. President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday of ""consequences"" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. During the video call, Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia, according to Beijing's statements about the call. Wang said the most important message Xi sent was that China has always been a force for maintaining world peace. ""We have always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war,"" Wang said, reiterating that China will make independent judgements. ""China's position is objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China's claims are on the right side of history."" Also on Saturday, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said that sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia over Ukraine were increasingly ""outrageous"". The United States and its European and Asian allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for the Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour, which they call a war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin. He says he launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. While saying it recognises Ukraine's sovereignty, Beijing has repeatedly said that Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed and urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict.
