1/13/2022,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish scientists have found a gene that they say more than doubles the risk of becoming severely ill with COVID-19, a discovery they hope could help doctors identify people who are most at risk from the disease. With vaccine hesitancy a major factor behind high coronavirus death rates in central and eastern Europe, researchers hope that identifying those at greatest risk will encourage them to get a shot and give them access to more intensive treatment options in case of an infection. ""After more than a year and a half of work it was possible to identify a gene responsible for a predisposition to becoming seriously ill (with coronavirus),"" said Health Minister Adam Niedzielski. ""This means that in the future we will be able to... identify people with a predisposition to suffer seriously from COVID."" The researchers from the Medical University of Bialystok found that the gene was the fourth most important factor determining how seriously a person suffers from COVID-19, after age, weight and gender. The gene is present in around 14% of the Polish population, compared to 8-9% in Europe as a whole and 27% in India, said Marcin Moniuszko, the professor in charge of the project. Other studies have also shown the importance of genetic factors in how seriously COVID-19 develops. In November, British scientists said they had identified a version of a gene that may be associated with double the risk of lung failure from COVID-19.

1/13/2022,"YORK, Maine — Town officials released video footage late Wednesday that shows a York Police Department officer using a K-9 to subdue local pediatrician Stephen Brennan during a traffic stop more than two years ago. The release of the footage comes about a week after Brennan's attorneys announced their client had reached a $325,000 settlement agreement with the town and Patrolman Jonathan Rogers, who had released the dog during the encounter on Sept. 20, 2019. In a joint statement released with the footage, York Town Manager Steve Burns and Acting Police Chief Owen Davis said Rogers “simply did his job to keep York a safe place.” Brennan was 63 at the time of the incident and ran Yorkids Pediatrics. Brennan suffered multiple injuries, including dog bites that his attorneys said required months of follow-up and wound care. The 21-minute video, which was released in response to a public records request from Seacoast Media Group, includes audio and dashboard camera video. There was no body-worn camera used during the encounter, Burns said. Rogers pulled over Brennan for allegedly flashing his high beams. The video shows Brennan stepped out of his vehicle before Rogers' cruiser had fully stopped. As Brennan walked toward the police cruiser, Rogers shouted at him to put his hands up. Brennan complied at first, but he continued walking while Rogers yelled three times for him to stop. Brennan stopped for a moment with his hands raised, then he dropped them and turned back toward his own vehicle. Rogers left his cruiser and approached Brennan, telling him to stop moving. Rogers had his gun drawn and pointed at Brennan. Brennan turned again toward Rogers, who repeatedly warned that he would sic the K-9 on him if he did not turn around and comply. After Rogers told Brennan six times to get on the ground, Brennan dropped to his knees. Rogers told Brennan to get on the ground one more time as the K-9 ran toward Brennan and knocked him to the ground. No more than 40 seconds elapsed between when Rogers' patrol car came to a stop on scene and when his K-9 can be seen in the video running at Brennan. Previous story: York pays pediatrician $325K following attack by police dog during minor traffic stop While Brennan was on the ground with the police dog on top of him, Rogers told him to get on the ground again and put his hands behind his back. Brennan rolled onto his stomach as the dog appeared to continue biting down on his leg. At the same time, Rogers told Brennan to stop resisting. Rogers was on the ground atop Brennan while the K-9 continued subdue him. Rogers eventually pulled the dog off of Brennan, who remained on the ground with his hands behind his back. The K-9's engagement with Brennan lasted about 80 seconds. Several officers and an ambulance arrived to assist Rogers and tend to Brennan’s injuries. Rogers told Brennan he was under arrest for refusing to submit to arrest or detention. Rogers can be heard telling the other officers about Brennan's injuries. “He looks like I beat the f---ing s--- out of him. I really didn’t,"" Rogers said. ""I just released the dog.” Emergency medical technicians told Rogers one of Brennan’s eyes had bled and he couldn’t see out of it. Rogers told the EMT that he had smacked Brennan with his hand in the area that the eye was bleeding. When an ambulance arrived 13 minutes into the interaction, Rogers informed the responders Brennan’s leg had been chewed and was bloody. Brennan’s interaction with police, the K-9 and EMTs lasted about 16 minutes before Brennan was placed in an ambulance. At the time, York police said the response was warranted because, they said, Brennan had been an aggressor. Brennan’s attorney, Alexander Spadinger of Shaheen and Gordon, said the settlement makes clear that initial attempts by York police to paint Brennan as the aggressor were untrue. They said Brennan was in the process of getting down on the ground to surrender when the K-9 was released. The decision to release a trained police dog was neither reasonable nor necessary, Spadinger added. Brennan suffered multiple injuries as a result of the dog bites that required months of follow-up and wound care treatment, including puncture wounds to both legs and his left arm, as well as a chest wall injury and trauma to his left eye, according to the statement. “As a result of this case, Dr. Brennan is hopeful that the York Police Department will take steps to ensure that next time one of its officers is faced with a situation like this, they turn first to their de-escalation training before resorting to physical force,” Spadinger added. In contrast, Burns said the settlement was decided by the town’s insurer and does not reflect wrongdoing by York police. “The settlement is because we have insurance so that the insurance company dictates anything that has to do with financial risk to them. They make the decisions, they pay that settlement. The town does not pay that,” Burns said. “It does not cost the taxpayers anything, other than if the insurance premiums go up.” 'Didn't have to be this way': Wentworth-Douglass COVID-19 care nurses pushed to the limit Burns said Rogers still works for York police. Burns declined to comment on whether the town believes the settlement was fair. Burns said the incident between Rogers and Brennan triggered an internal investigation by the York police command staff that did not lead to any disciplinary action. Rogers was told not to use such vulgar language, but that was it, Burns said. No changes have been made to YPD use of force and dog policies in response to this incident, Burns said. Acting Police Chief Owen Davis said York police conducted a ""thorough investigation"" that found Rogers' actions followed all department operating procedures and used ""the appropriate amount of force necessary to gain control of the situation while ensuring the safety of both parties."" Davis said Rogers used numerous verbal commands to deescalate the situation and Brennan refused to comply, which prompted Rogers to employ “non-lethal force” to take Brennan into custody. Three witnesses to the event came forward and provided statements in support of Rogers’ actions, Davis said. In the statement, Burns said police have a difficult job. “I’m often told I have a difficult job, and that people wouldn’t want my job. I look at the job our Police Officers do … and think, my job is easy by comparison,” Burns said. “Police Officers are kind and caring, and provide all manner of public service to our residents. However, at any moment they are prepared to jump into action to keep our community safe.” Police work is neither pretty nor pleasant, Burns added, and they are often called upon to make on-the-spot, life-altering decisions. “Their work, however, is absolutely necessary to protect the quality of life we enjoy in our community,” Burns said. Despite the settlement, Kasia S. Park, the attorney who represented the town and Rogers, continued to deny any wrongdoing on the part of Rogers, Sgt. Brian Curtin and the York Police Department. ""There was no finding by the federal court that an initial report made by Sgt. Brian Curtin was false,"" Park said. ""The federal court did not make any findings in this case. There was no finding of wrongdoing on the part of Officer Rogers, the Town or any other York officer. The parties decided to mediate this case and a settlement was reached. There was no admission of wrongdoing or liability. ""This was not a routine traffic stop,"" Park said. ""Dr. Brennan jumped out of the car before Officer Rogers even stopped his cruiser and started heading towards Officer Rogers. Officer Rogers did not know the identity of the driver at the time, did not know why the driver was jumping out of the car or if he was armed, or if there was anyone else in the car. There were three civilian witnesses who came forward describing Dr. Brennan as being the aggressor during the encounter.""

1/13/2022,"Sen. Tommy Tuberville bought between $115,000 and $250,000 in Alibaba stock in December, his financial disclosures say. The senator has been outspoken against China and moved to prohibit US investment in the Chinese economy. Tuberville last year also owned stock put options in Alibaba, which he later told Insider he sold. Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama bought and sold shares in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, financial disclosures filed on Wednesday showed. According to the filings, Tuberville made three separate purchases as a joint owner of the American Depositary Receipt shares from December 14 to December 21. The first two purchases were in the $50,001 to $100,000 range each, and the third transaction was in the $15,001 to $50,000 range, meaning Tuberville purchased between $115,000 and $250,000 in stock in total. He then sold up Alibaba stock worth between $50,001 and $100,000 on December 23. It was a partial sale, according to the filing. Congresstrading.com first tweeted out the news. Tuberville is one of China's most vocal critics in Congress. In May 2021, the GOP senator introduced an act prohibiting funds from the Thrift Savings Plan from being invested in companies linked to China's economy. The TSP is a retirement savings and investment program for US federal employees and uniformed personnel. ""We've seen it time and again — Chinese companies don't play by the rules, committing intellectual property theft and disregarding basic regulatory standards at the expense of investors,"" Tuberville said at the time. The same week, the senator said Americans should be aware of how China's government is ""coming after us"" with ""plans to subdue the American spirit."" ""The Chinese Communist Party has continually spied on its citizens, violently suppressed dissent, and systematically persecuted religious and ethnic minorities to the point of genocide,"" Tuberville said. Like many Chinese companies, Alibaba is closely linked to the Chinese Communist Party. In 2019, Reuters reported that the tech giant developed a propaganda app for China's government, and for a time, it became the most popular download on the country's Apple app store. According to reports, Alibaba founder and former chairman Jack Ma is also a Chinese Communist Party member. This isn't the first time that Tuberville's trades involved Alibaba. Last year, Tuberville's disclosures filed in June showed he held between $15,001 and $50,000 in Alibaba stock put options. He reported the actual value of his Alibaba stock as between $1,001 and $15,000 and earned up to $1,000 in capital gains during 2020, Insider's Dave Levinthal and Kimberly Leonard reported in June last year. His spokesperson said at the time that he no longer owned Alibaba stock. ""Senator Tuberville has long had financial advisors who actively manage his portfolio without his day-to-day involvement,"" Tuberville's spokesperson told CNBC on Wednesday when asked about his December share purchases, echoing the response from the senator's office to questions about his shares in June. Sen. Tuberville's spokesperson did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",Business/Business Insider,"Republican Sen.

1/13/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Russia on Thursday sharply raised the stakes in a showdown with the West over Ukraine, with a top diplomat saying he wouldn't exclude a Russian military deployment to Cuba and Venezuela if tensions with the United States mount. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, who led the Russian delegation in Monday’s talks with the United States in Geneva, said in televised remarks that he would neither confirm nor exclude the possibility that Russia could send military assets to Cuba and Venezuela. The negotiations in Geneva and Wednesday’s NATO-Russia meeting in Vienna failed to narrow the gap on Moscow’s security demands amid a buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine. While Moscow demanded a halt to NATO expansion, Washington and its allies firmly rejected them as a nonstarter. Speaking in an interview with Russian RTVI TV broadcast, Ryabkov noted that “it all depends on the action by our U.S. counterparts,” adding that President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia could take military-technical measures if the U.S. provokes Moscow and turns up military pressure on it. Ryabkov said a refusal by the U.S. and its allies to consider the key Russian demand for guarantees against the alliance’s expansion to Ukraine and other ex-Soviet nations raises doubts about continuing the talks. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted “some positive elements and nuances” during the talks, but described them as “unscuccessful” because of stark disagreements on Russia’s key demands. “The talks were initiated to receive specific answers to concrete principal issues that were raised, and disagreements remained on those principal issues, which is bad,” he said in a conference call with reporters. Peskov warned of a complete rupture U.S.-Russian relations if proposed sanctions targeting Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top civilian and military leaders are adopted. The measures, proposed by Senate Democrats, would also target leading leading Russian financial institutions if Moscow sends troops into Ukraine. Peskov criticized the proposals as an attempt to up the pressure on Moscow during the talks, saying it wouldn't work. “It concerns sanctions, which taking into account the inevitable adequate response, effectively amount to an initiative to rupture relations,” he warned, adding that Russian will respond in kind to protect its interests. The talks come as an estimated 100,000 combat-ready Russian troops, tanks and heavy military equipment are massed near Ukraine’s eastern border. The buildup has caused deep concerns in Kyiv and the West that Moscow is preparing for an invasion. Russia denies that it's pondering an invasion and in turn accuses the West of threatening its security by positioning military personnel and equipment in Central and Eastern Europe. Peskov rebuffed the West's calls for Russia to help deescalate tensions by pulling back troops from areas near Ukraine, noting that the country is free to move them wherever it deems necessary on its own territory. “It's hardly possible for NATO to dictate to us where we should move our armed forces on the Russian territory,” he said. Peskov underscored that Russia is ready to continue the talks but wants them to produce results. “There will be no deficit of a political will to continue the negotiations,” he said. Tensions revolving around Ukraine and Russia's demands on the West again appeared on the table at Thursday's meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Vienna. Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau, who assumed the position of the OSCE Chairman-in-Office, noted in his opening speech that ""the risk of war in the OSCE area is now greater than ever before in the last 30 years.” “For several weeks, we have been faced with the possibility of a major military escalation in Eastern Europe,"" he said. “We have recently heard a demand for security guarantees related to an important part of the OSCE area and the renewed discourse about spheres of influence. All these aspects require a serious international assessment and a proper reaction.” Rau emphasized the need to “focus on a peaceful resolution of a conflict in and around Ukraine ... in full respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders."" In 2014, Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula after the ouster of its Moscow-friendly leader and threw its weight behind a separatist insurgency in the country’s east, where more than seven years of fighting has killed over 14,000 people. A 2015 peace deal brokered by France and Germany has helped end large-scale battles, but frequent skirmishes have continued and efforts to negotiate a political settlement have failed. ___ Emily Schultheis reported from Vienna.",World/Associated Press,"Russian diplomat leaves open Cuba, Venezuela army deployment",https://news.yahoo.com/kremlin-says-deplores-lack-progress-120306442.html
