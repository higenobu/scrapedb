3/3/2022,"The Premier League is considering adding a human rights component to its owners’ and directors’ test as it conducts a review of the controversial regulation. The review is part of a wide-ranging reassessment of the league’s governance and comes as pressure again grows to expand the criteria by which it assesses prospective owners. League officials were keen to play down the significance of the review, suggesting it was normal practice and that the consideration of human rights was one of many factors being looked at. Any changes would need to be approved by at least 14 of the league’s 20 clubs. However, the league acknowledges it needs owners who benefit the competition during a period of greater scrutiny from the public and politicians. On Wednesday the leader of the Labour party, Sir Keir Starmer, called for sanctions to be applied against the Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich, who has put Chelsea up for sale, has vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Vladimir Putin and Russia or that he has done anything to merit being sanctioned. Gary Neville, the Salford City co-owner and campaigner for reform in football, who in January joined the Labour Party, said the situation involving Abramovich showed the need for a reinforced owners’ test. “Do I think [Abramovich] should be kicked out of English football? I’m not there yet but I do think we need a robust fit-and-proper owners’ test,” he told the FT Business of Football Summit. “It needs to be more robust and resilient. We also need more transparency.” Last year the takeover of Newcastle United by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund was met with protest by supporters and human rights groups and the government’s fan-led review, led by Tracey Crouch MP, called for an enhanced owners’ and directors’ test when published in November. One condition proposed by Crouch would assess a candidate’s integrity, or whether “the proposed owner is of good character such that they should be allowed to be the custodian of an important community asset”. The fan-led review was welcomed by the government and there remains expectation that a bill to turn its recommendations into law, including the creation of an independent regulator for the game, will form part of the Queen’s Speech later this year. The Premier League remains in regular discussions with government over possible legislation. The league has held two meetings with Amnesty International in recent months to discuss Amnesty’s suggestion of a fully human-rights compliant owners’ test. The Amnesty test called, among other things, for the Premier League board to consider whether a prospective owner or director had been complicit in serious violations of international human rights law or any conduct at odds with the league’s anti-discrimination policy.",Sport/Football,Premier League considers adding human rights to new owners’ test,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/03/premier-league-considers-adding-human-rights-to-new-owners-test
3/3/2022,"A Kuwaiti princess seeking asylum in Bosnia-Herzegovina has claimed the Kuwaiti state is using an Interpol red notice to intimidate and harass her and force the extradition of her partner, a prominent dissident blogger, back to the country. Sheikha Moneera Fahad al-Sabah and Mesaed al-Mesaileem, said they face torture and threats to their lives if they are returned to Kuwait due to their political activism. Kuwait has secured an Interpol red notice for Mesaileem – which acts as an international arrest warrant – and which the couple’s lawyer claims has likely been issued under false pretences. “States with poor human rights records are increasingly requesting extradition on the basis of political grounds,” said Alexis Thiry, legal adviser at Mena Rights Group, a Switzerland-based NGO that is providing legal representation to Mesaileem. “This is a very concerning development from a human rights perspective because such practice undermines the principle of non-refoulement, a rule of international customary law.” Non-refoulement is the fundamental principle underpinning international refugee law, that maintains that a person requiring protection cannot be forcibly returned to a place where they will face harm. The UN human rights council has said it is “deeply concerned” by the risk of Mesaileem’s extradition back to Kuwait. Both Sabah and Mesaileem have been publicly critical of the Kuwait state on social media, with Sabah alleging corruption in Kuwait’s ruling family. Sabah’s great uncle is Kuwait’s ruler, Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, who came to power in September 2020. She is the granddaughter of Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, the previous Kuwaiti emir. Sabah told the Guardian she had received multiple threats to her safety from her family and other powerful figures in Kuwait. “They’re going to kill me. They’ve raised some [legal] cases in Kuwait against me for assaulting the being of the royal family,” said Sabah, 35, who said she was imprisoned by her father for nearly a year. “When I first started speaking about corruption, they accused me of being mentally ill, and said I need to be in an institute. So, I’m scared they will lock me up, take my phones away, not let me speak because I have a lot of secrets.” The couple, who moved to Bosnia in 2020, have both surrendered their passports and been issued with yellow asylum seeker cards by the UN high commissioner for refugees. However, their asylum claim has not been granted by the Bosnian government, leaving them in legal limbo with the threat that deportation could happen at any time. The couple claim that men identifying themselves as Interpol officers raided their home in April 2020, saying they were acting on a red notice issued two years previously on charges relating to possession of weapons. However, Mena Rights Group argues that the basis of the red notice is false, and that it is being used to bring Mesaileem back to Kuwait to face political charges. Mesaileem has been sentenced multiple times in Kuwait on charges linked to freedom of expression, including using his mobile phone to organise demonstrations and insulting the emir on social media. In total, Kuwaiti courts have sentenced Mesaileem in absentia to 87 years in prison for his political activities, according to a UN special procedures letter. He has already spent periods in detention, where he claims he was mistreated. Concerns about abuses of Interpol notices by authoritarian regimes to snare dissidents have grown since Maj Gen Ahmed Naser al-Raisi, a leading security official from the United Arab Emirates, was elected to its presidency in November. Sabah and Mesaileem said they fear that pressure from the Kuwaiti state will see them deported and have called for Mesaileem to be removed from the Interpol red notice list. When contacted for comment, an Interpol spokesperson said the decisions over arrests and extraditions are the responsibility of each of its member states’ domestic authorities, known as National Central Bureaus (NCBs). “Red notices are requests to law enforcement worldwide to locate and, in accordance with national laws, provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action,” the spokesperson said. “Interpol’s General Secretariat cannot instruct NCBs on whether to arrest an individual or refrain from doing so, or whether to engage in extradition proceedings, etc. Such decisions are exclusively within the discretion of the competent national authorities of member countries.” The Bosnian and Kuwaiti authorities were approached for comment.",News/Global development,Interpol arrest warrant allegedly targeting Kuwaiti princess and partner ‘on political grounds’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/03/interpol-arrest-warrant-allegedly-targeting-kuwaiti-princess-and-partner-on-political-grounds
3/3/2022,"As soon as the curfew was lifted in Kyiv, I drove around to understand what had happened to our capital overnight. For two full days residents had not been allowed to go out, even during the daytime. Russian saboteur groups were identified, and random street fights took place. I did not recognise my city, with checkpoints in the old town, with people digging trenches, bridges being fortified and the subway turned into a bomb shelter. A huge crowd, up to 500 people, lined up to volunteer for the territorial defence unit in one of the neighbourhoods. “Do you enrol everybody who shows up?” we asked a young guy in charge. “Almost all, but I do not accept those under 18,” he said. “And there are a lot of them. I wouldn’t be able to look their mothers in the eyes. I fought in 2014-2015 in Donbas, so I know what the war is.” It’s a predominantly male group but there are three women. The youngest is a lawyer. “What Russia has already done to the civilians has made us act,” she said. She had not told her family of her decision to fight. They live in a small town on the Ukrainian-Russian border, which has been partially destroyed. Another woman, in her 60s, said she was a nurse. Her husband had joined the defence units and she felt she needed to be with him. The last was a retired officer. She enrolled because her son had already joined the Ukrainian army. “When our grandparents, who remember the second world war, were wishing for peace, we didn’t understand why, she said, but now I know.” The figures say one thing, experience another. The official toll of civilian deaths is 350, but after six days’ fighting, there cannot be a single Ukrainian who doesn’t know somebody who has been touched by tragedy. “That’s my classmate,” one colleague wrote, on seeing the front page of the Guardian, with a photo showing a woman wounded by shrapnel during the first attacks in Chuguev, on the eastern border. Elena Kurilova is not well. She can’t see with her left eye, and it’s getting worse. Her daughter, whose Instagram account looks like that of a beauty blogger, now livestreams with her mother in bandages to prove to Russian commentators that the injuries are real; her mother is not a fake. One of the flats destroyed belongs to a colleague in Kyiv. It was hit by a rocket and she circulates the pictures, but first she complains how unfair it is that Russian media have used pictures of her flat to accuse Ukraine of bombing its own people. “Those of you who have come to ‘rescue us’, just go away,” cries a woman holding a baby at Kyiv’s main station. “We were all right before you came. Just leave. All I have is some cash and a backpack.” Like thousands of people here, her mission is to go somewhere else, anywhere. The Ukrainian railway allows everybody to ride without tickets, including foreign citizens, and is running extra trains to the west. We count the hours: seven, 20, 70, 100, 144: hours of the Ukrainian army on its own, its citizens holding off one of the mightiest armies in the world, which is now being bolstered by support from Belarus. The count become symbolic. For those under bombardment, each hour seems like a year. The primary Russian target is the capital, and that army has been struggling to take it, but the fight is also a fierce one in many small towns whose names are never mentioned in the headlines. Irpin, Hostomel, Bucha were all attacked, but not captured. In Vasylkiv, on the Stuhna river, the college where IT specialists, construction workers, chefs and barbers study and train has been destroyed. Luckily 18 people who were staying in the college’s dorm were evacuated. The director of the college, Liudmyla Postolenko, walks through the debris, showing a damaged hall that had only recently been renovated. “Thank God, all are alive,” she says. “But our hearts are broken. Our kids are crying … But, you know, among our students there are construction workers, welders – so we will rebuild. What we need to do is care, and support those who are fighting.” Two weeks before the invasion, when things were still calm, I travelled to a town in Donbas and met a friend: a humanitarian worker from Kyiv, who had moved there after the start of the fighting. He took a day to walk around the city “to say goodbye to the last peaceful days”. He was confident, as were many, that the Ukrainian army, which managed to defend and take over towns in the area eight years ago, was in better shape. Still, while walking in a chilly but tranquil industrial town, he took pictures to remember. With every shot I felt more anger. I didn’t want to accept the notion of saying goodbye to peace. Driving through Kyiv, I film the queues outside the pharmacies and shops. The scenes in heavily shelled areas are surreal. The post office window has been broken for four days but no one has looted it. The computers and parcels are all perfectly in place. I film the billboards above the roads. They’re written in Russian, saying: “Russian soldier, stop! How can you look into your kids’ eyes? Remain human”; “Russian soldier, stop! Do not kill your soul for Putin’s oligarchs. Leave without blood on your hands.” There are details of the deal being offered by Ukraine’s defence minister to Russian conscripts: 5m roubles for anybody prepared to lay down their arms. I take photos of random buildings: Kyiv zoo, the opera house, my former office. The next day, they may not be there. For months before Putin’s air force attacked Ukraine, I was being asked by those abroad why Ukrainians were not panicking. I said we were not scared and that the source of our confidence was a belief that we could prove to Russia that in the long run we were unconquerable. And in the first days of the invasion, when civilians were killed by airstrikes that mainly missed their targets, it seemed clear that the Kremlin blitzkrieg was not working. But the cruise missiles that killed people in Freedom Square in Kharkiv, in the north-east, in the hospitals in Zhytomyr in the west, and in the residential areas in Mariupol in the south, showed us that the strategy has changed: now the plan is to terrify Ukrainians into submission. And this is just the beginning. Looking at the courage, unity, support and the heroics of our troops, 90% of Ukrainians believe Ukraine will win. The question is the price. Six days were enough to get used to sirens and bomb shelters; a new reality in which I did not walk outside without a flak jacket. In a few days we might need to get used to life without electricity or running water. Ukrainians are ready for that. But the loss of all the lives feel different. These are losses that could and should have been prevented. They are something neither we or the outside world should get used to.

3/3/2022,"It took just eight days, and a war, for the International Olympic Committee to pull off an audacious mid-air manoeuvre that would not have been out of place on the slopes of the Winter Olympics. For much of February, as Beijing hosted the 2022 Games, the IOC was insistent: there is no place for politics in sport. “With regards to the Uyghur population, the position of the IOC must be to give political neutrality,” said the president, Thomas Bach, in early February. Yet just a week after the curtain fell on the Winter Olympics, the IOC radically backflipped. “In order to protect the integrity of global sports competitions and for the safety of all the participants,” the IOC executive board resolved on Monday, Russian and Belarusian athletes should be excluded from international competition. “The IOC reaffirms the call of the IOC president,” the statement continued. “Give peace a chance.” All of which begs the question: why are crimes against the Uyghur people and human rights violations in China just fine, but invading Ukraine beyond the pale? After a Winter Olympics replete with resort to neutrality, this blatant hypocrisy provokes a certain feeling of whiplash. Through this inexplicable sporting lens, it seems as if some atrocities are OK, but Russia crossed the line by marching on Kyiv. The IOC has at last done the right thing. Given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, Russian participation in international sporting competitions would be unthinkable right now. Fifa, too, deserves some credit for excluding Russian teams from international competitions. The human cost is regrettable – ordinary Russian athletes, many of whom have no links to President Vladimir Putin’s regime and play no part in this current insanity. Yet a sporting ban on Russia is the only reasonable course of action as missiles rain down on Ukrainian civilians. But what took these sporting bodies so long? Russia invaded Georgia in 2008, a year after the IOC had awarded the 2014 Games to Sochi. Curiously, given recent events, the IOC was mute at the time. Six years later, on the day of the Winter Olympics closing ceremony, Russia’s annexation of Crimea began. In the following months, Russia invaded eastern Ukraine. Rather than condemning the violence, the Olympic governing body dished out honours to Putin loyalists (which, on Monday, they laughably clawed back). Fifa followed with the men’s World Cup, in 2018, notwithstanding Russia’s continuing occupation of Crimea, its proxy separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk and, just months before the tournament, a botched assassination attempt on English soil. Sportswashing has consequences – events in Ukraine over the past week have made that abundantly clear. By allowing their crown jewels to be used to burnish Russia’s image, the IOC and Fifa have been complicit in Putin’s wanton acts over the past decade. No doubt it is possible that, even if the 2014 Olympics or 2018 World Cup had been scrapped, we may still be where we are today. But the IOC and Fifa’s inaction hardly helped. When they should have acted, the governing bodies lacked the conviction to make hard choices. It is easy now for both to speak out; they have had their sporting jamborees – funded by the Russian taxpayer, enriching Russian oligarchs – and gone home. It is safe to condemn Putin today, from their Swiss palaces, with nothing on the line. By their latest actions, the IOC and Fifa have shown themselves to be nothing but opportunistic: neutral when it suits their commercial ambitions and political when they feel the need to swing in line with global opinion. With the Qatar 2022 World Cup later this year, the change of heart is unlikely to last. The tournament will go ahead using infrastructure quite likely built on the back of forced labour, in a nation ranked as “not free” by rights watchdog Freedom House, where the rights of women and LGBTQI+ Qataris are limited. Russia might not be there, but nor will the 6,500 migrant workers who have died in Qatar since the World Cup was awarded. Fifa’s culpability runs deep. Sport has always been political, dating right back to the first Olympiads of ancient Greece, when city states jostled, occasionally even resorting to violence, for the influence that came with hosting the Games. Insisting otherwise, as the IOC, Fifa and other global sporting bodies have long done, shows wilful disregard for reality. Yet they persisted with the myth, including just a week ago, when the latest Olympic circus ended in Beijing with barely a squeak about human rights. Their Russia ban is welcome, if cynical. But it only underscores their tremendous duplicity, their failure of leadership and the moral vacuum that sees the brutal repression of the Uyghur people, the Tibetans, the Hongkongers as warranting no more than “political neutrality”.

3/3/2022,"Australia’s second-biggest superannuation fund, the $230bn Australian Retirement Trust, has joined the wave of investors fleeing Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. The fund, which has about 2 million members and was formed on Monday through the merger of Sunsuper and QSuper, said it gave instructions to sell its Russian shares “earlier this week”. The Morrison government said on Thursday it had a “strong expectation” that Australian super funds would divest from Russia. Russia was on Thursday kicked out of a key index that fund managers use to guide their investments after index provider MSCI said the country’s market was “uninvestable”. Australia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, as well as the New South Wales government and big super funds Aware, Rest and Cbus have all pledged to divest from Russia as soon as possible. “The government welcomes the voluntary actions taken to date by some superannuation funds to divest their Russian assets,” the federal treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, and the minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, said in a joint statement. “While Australian superannuation funds only have a small exposure to Russian investments in the context of the $3.5tn superannuation system, it is important that Australia sends a clear and unequivocal signal that we condemn in the strongest possible terms Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified attack on Ukraine.” The statement poured additional political pressure on Australia’s biggest fund, AustralianSuper, which has been criticised by activist investors for refusing to disclose what it intends to do with hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian assets. The Australian government on Wednesday slapped sanctions on Russia’s central bank, making it impossible for it to increase its holding of about $8bn worth of Australian government bonds. Frydenberg has said the government will continue to pay interest on the bonds. A government source said the payments would be made to European clearing house Euroclear, but would not travel on to the Russian central bank due to sanctions in Europe. ART’s chief investment officer, Ian Patrick, said the fund had “instructed its investment managers earlier this week to sell any remaining debt and equity investments and not to make any new investments in either Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus, which has now entered the conflict alongside Russia”. “In some cases, this may prove challenging, given that some key markets remain closed or difficult to access.” The Moscow stock exchange has been closed since Monday and Ukrainian media reports it will remain closed on Thursday. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Patrick said QSuper and Sunsuper’s investments in Russia “were very limited prior to the onset of the crisis”. Sunsuper had less than 0.2% of members’ funds invested in Russian stocks and less than 0.1% in Russian bonds, while QSuper had no Russian investments at all, he said. The removal of Russia from MSCI’s emerging market indexes is likely to force the hand of some fund managers who have so far held back from dumping shares in the country’s companies from their portfolios. In a statement, MSCI said the decision followed consultation with institutional investors and will take effect from next Wednesday. “During the consultation, MSCI received feedback from a large number of global market participants, including asset owners, asset managers, broker dealers, and exchanges with an overwhelming majority confirming that the Russian equity market is currently uninvestable and that Russian securities should be removed from the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexes,” MSCI said in a statement. “Consultation participants highlighted several recent negative developments that led to a material deterioration in the accessibility of the Russian equity market to international institutional investors,” it said. AustralianSuper again declined to comment on its Russian holdings on Thursday. The fund’s public disclosures reveal it had a portfolio of Russian investments, including shares in Russia’s biggest bank, Sberbank, that before last week was valued at more than $300m. However, shares in Sberbank, which were valued by Aussie at almost $140m, have now become close to worthless after sanctions wiped out the company’s European business. It is believed that by the end of last week the fund had disposed of some Russian assets, reducing its total exposure to about $120m, but retains shares in Sberbank. Hospitality sector fund Hostplus has also disclosed it holds Sberbank shares, worth $49.2m as of 30 September. However, a spokesperson said the $76bn fund currently had direct holdings of Russian stocks and bonds totalling just $19m. “We continue to work with our existing managers across our investment portfolios and continue to monitor the impacts of this evolving situation especially in light of the Russian Central Bank ordering market players to reject attempts by foreign clients to sell Russian securities,” the spokesperson said.",News/Australia news,Australian Retirement Trust joins other super funds in divesting from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/03/australian-retirement-trust-joins-other-super-funds-in-divesting-from-russia
