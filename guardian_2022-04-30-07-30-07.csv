4/30/2022,"Pep Guardiola has laughed off Jürgen Klopp’s and Liverpool’s complaints about their schedule this week by saying if he allowed Manchester City’s fixture timetable to affect him he would go and manage in the Maldives. Klopp is unhappy that after facing Villarreal on Wednesday in the Champions League his team travel to Newcastle for Saturday’s early kick-off. This moved his club to try to change the time of the match. When Guardiola was asked how he viewed the German’s remarks, his initial answer had a cutting tone. “Always I sympathise about the concerns of Liverpool,” he said. “How many times have we discussed what’s happened to us and I’ve said I don’t want to talk about that. It’s not going to change because the broadcasters are thinking about what they have to do to get more viewers. “Of course I understand it but what can I say? Sir Alex Ferguson was the most important icon in the history of English football and he was complaining [about this] when he was a teenager. We played in Madrid against Atlético and three days later we played at Wembley in an FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool. Chelsea played Tuesday [of that week] and could have played on Saturday but played on Sunday [in the other semi-final]. Do you think they [broadcasters] think about that? No, because the next Tuesday, Liverpool play against United. Everyone has their own business to defend. We adapt. “If I’m not satisfied I go home and don’t be manager of Man City. I go to another league in the Maldives, and play one game a week and I’m so comfortable under the coconuts. But it’s not the case. You are playing at 12.30 – I’m sorry, Liverpool, but I’m not involved with that.” Guardiola offered a quip when asked whether there was disappointment that Mohamed Salah was voted the Football Writers’ men’s player of the year instead of Kevin De Bruyne. “Congrats to Salah,” he said. “Jürgen says they have the best keeper, defender, midfielder, strikers so it’s normal for them to win the award,” Klopp has said that Alisson is the best No 1 and his deputy, Caoimhín Kelleher, the finest No 2. City are at Leeds later on Saturday, knowing if they win there and their final four matches they retain the title. Guardiola has no concern regarding his players feeling the pressure. “They have been here many times,” he said. “These players, I know them.” John Stones and Kyle Walker remain injured.",Sport/Football,Pep Guardiola gives short shrift to Liverpool’s fixture complaints,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/pep-guardiola-gives-short-shrift-to-liverpools-fixture-complaints
4/30/2022,"Frank Lampard has no intention of quitting Everton even if the club suffer a first relegation since 1951. Everton have six games to save their Premier League status, starting with the visit of Lampard’s former club Chelsea on Sunday, and would be five points adrift of Burnley by kick-off if their relegation rivals win at Watford. The Everton manager remains focused on survival, and therefore reluctant to consider or discuss the possibility of relegation, but confirmed he intended to remain in the job beyond this season. “I am very committed,” said Lampard, who succeeded Rafael Benítez on 31 January. “I really don’t want to get into the headlines, or ins and outs of that, but absolutely [I am committed].” Asked whether he would manage an Everton team in the Championship, Lampard replied: “I don’t want to get drawn on that question but what I will say is I have loved every minute of being at this club. Sometimes people from the outside ask me, because of the position we are in: ‘Are you enjoying it, with all the pressures of it?’ I absolutely love it. “I have been welcomed incredibly well by the fans and supported by them and I will do everything to get this club back to where I want it to be. I’m not going to jump into the future because it’s not worth it but, in terms of my dedication to this job, I will give it absolutely everything for as long as Everton want me here and I can get them to where I think we can get to.” The Everton manager has defended Anthony Gordon after fierce criticism of the 21-year-old’s performance against Liverpool last weekend, when he was booked for diving and had a strong penalty appeal denied by the referee Stuart Attwell. Lampard said: “I don’t think it is the case [that Gordon goes to ground easily]. I think Anthony’s booking was the first in his senior career for simulation. If you look at attacking players in the league, fast players who change direction quickly and then the defender sticks their leg out and makes contact, I think you could find many clips that look similar. “Whether it’s a penalty or not – I’m not going to sit here and say it’s stonewall – but there is definitely contact. The second half one is a penalty in my firm opinion, although it won’t be everyone’s opinion. Anthony was ahead of the defender [Joël Matip], the defender stepped on his foot and gave him a push. “I think it’s unfair to put that on Anthony. Anthony is a great kid. He is very similar to Mason Mount in his attitude, his application and his talent levels.”",Sport/Football,Frank Lampard ‘very committed’ to Everton even if relegation battle is lost,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/frank-lampard-very-committed-to-everton-even-if-relegation-battle-is-lost
4/30/2022,"Antonio Conte has reacted angrily to the suggestion that he has offered his services to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, with the French club expected to sack Mauricio Pochettino, describing it as a lie, fake news and unfair to everybody. The Tottenham manager’s focus is on nothing other than his club’s final five matches of the Premier League season – the first is Leicester at home on Sunday – and giving everything to secure a Champions League finish. And yet the obsession continues to carry a sting. Conte could very easily kill all rumours about his future by promising to remain at Spurs next season. He will not do so. Conte doubled down hard on his position on Friday, maintaining that he would discuss next season with the club’s hierarchy only after the current campaign had ended. There was also the habitual reminder that he wanted to assemble a squad which could do more than battle for the top four. “Obviously, I think it’s good that other clubs appreciate my work,” Conte said, when asked about the PSG link. “But the truth is that I don’t like when people try to invent news – only to speak, only to create problems. This is not right. Not fair for me, for the clubs involved and for my players. The people that want to tell something about this have to show respect for all the people involved in this situation and not invent fakenews and tell a lot of lies. “In this moment, in our minds, me, the club and the players have to be focused on the last five games. I said to you a lot of times, at the end of the season, we speak with the club but with pleasure, in a really good way – to find the best solution for everybody. “Don’t forget I like to have ambition, not only to fight for a place in Champions League or a place in Uefa [Europa] League. Honestly, I want to fight for much more, you understand? I deserve to do this – to fight for and win trophies, to fight for something important, not for only sixth or seventh, eight place or, if you have a fantastic season, fourth place.” Conte was asked to clarify what he meant by the best solution. “It will be very important to understand how much time we need to fight for something important – if we have the patience to wait because, for sure, this is a process,” Conte replied. “I always say to you that we need time and patience. And we have to understand how much time we need and how much patience we have. “We have to understand if we can match my opinion and [the] club opinion. We are trying do this season in the best possible way and then we will see. I am enjoying it a lot in Tottenham. For this reason, we will have a private meeting and we will try to find the best solution.”",Sport/Football,Conte dismisses ‘fake’ PSG link but keeps Spurs hanging over his future,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/29/conte-dismisses-fake-psg-link-but-keeps-spurs-hanging-over-his-future
4/30/2022,"Hostile foreign states and others pose a “real risk” of gaining access and wielding influence through all-party parliamentary groups (APPGs), the Commons standards committee has warned. Calling for reforms to avert what it described as the “next great parliamentary scandal”, the committee also voiced concerns that a dramatic rise in the number of the informal cross-party groups also risks “inappropriate influence and access” because they are so difficult to monitor. The cautions come after an unprecedented security warning from MI5, circulated to MPs and peers earlier this year, that accused a lawyer of seeking to improperly influence parliamentarians on behalf of China’s ruling Communist party. Barry Gardiner had received more than £500,000 in donations from Christine Lee before the alert was issued. Giving private evidence to the report, the Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, said that indiscriminate engagement with state actors who may be hostile to UK interests did not take adequate account of the potential security risks to parliament. “I worry that we are not joining up our security and the threats that we have,” said Hoyle, in his oral evidence for the report published on Saturday. “These people are not our friends. “Some are our friends, but they have intentions and objectives, which worries me. If we are not careful, the security implication for the opening up of parliament is very, very worrying.” The report – titled All-Party Parliamentary Groups: improving governance and regulation – comes after an investigation earlier this year, by the Guardian and Open Democracy, found that more than £13m has been poured into a growing network of MPs’ interest groups by private firms including healthcare bodies, arms companies and tech companies, fuelling concerns over the potential for backdoor influence. The report states that “improper access” by paid lobbyists seeking to wield influence through APPGs was a risk that had been identified as far back as 2013, but that increased transparency introduced since has not mitigated the risk in the way it had been hoped. The threat from hostile overseas states seeking to wield influence discreetly through APPGs was one that had only developed in recent years, added the MPs behind the report. They said they had been persuaded by Hoyle’s evidence that this was “a very real risk, which needs addressing with some urgency”. APPGs are informal groups representing MPs’ and peers’ interests, from China and Russia to cancer, digital regulation, longevity and jazz. They must be chaired by MPs, but are often run or funded by lobbyists and corporate donors seeking to influence government policy. The standards committee concluded in their report: “We are concerned that if left unchecked, APPGs could represent the next great parliamentary scandal, with commercial entities effectively buying access to and influence of parliamentarians and decision-makers.” The MPs behind the report said Commons authorities should “provide more significant support” to help parliamentarians scrutinise the benefits being offered by foreign governments. Funding should be made more transparent, while the number of APPGs must be reduced from the current number of 744, the standards committee recommended. Regulatory enforcement was also advised, as was limits on secretariats of the groups to “reduce the risk of improper access”. Standards committee chair, Chris Bryant, said APPGs “must never be a backdoor means of peddling influence around the corridors of power or pursuing a commercial interest”. “[This] report represents a wake-up call for us all,” the Labour MP said. “The evidence we have gathered is chilling and points towards an urgent need for the house to take action.” In a statement at the time, Gardiner said he had been “liaising with our security services for a number of years about Christine Lee” and that he had been “assured by the security services that while they have definitively identified improper funding channelled through Christine Lee, this does not relate to any funding received by my office.”",News/UK news,Hostile foreign states pose ‘real risk’ of influencing MPs groups,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/29/hostile-foreign-states-pose-real-risk-of-influencing-mps-groups
4/30/2022,"The stakes were high, and happily for those who witnessed the Premiership’s latest end-to-end thriller, so was the level of entertainment. Harlequins demonstrated their endless fighting spirit before James Grayson’s long-range 77th-minute penalty edged Saints past the champions and secured a fifth consecutive league win. Northampton must still play Saracens and Newcastle, and are building what appears to be unstoppable momentum. Marshalled superbly by their scrum-half, Alex Mitchell, the Saints attack was irresistible, despite losing three of their starting pack to injury before half-time. Their lines of running and joined-up approach threatened to overwhelm Quins before Tabai Matson’s side battled back into the lead after the break, and into position for the win that would have secured a playoff spot. But the Saints go marching on. “I think it was a gutsy effort by the whole team but the pack particularly,” said the Northampton director of rugby, Chris Boyd. “For them to hang in there and stay connected for long enough to get some territory, force a penalty, and sneak over the top, it was a pretty decent effort.” On a clear, dry evening and on a pristine pitch it had not taken long for the home side to demonstrate their intent. A wonderful tip-on by Grayson helped to create the first five-pointer, making space for a razor-sharp pass by Mitchell to release Lewis Ludlam, who chucked the ball inside for Tommy Freeman to sprint over. Mitchell’s speed of service was doing damage and his rampaging run to the left was interrupted only by a try-saving tackle by his opposite number, Danny Care. The Saints prop Conor Carey was taken off on a stretcher after going down injured in the same move, after Northampton had already lost their No 8 Juarno Augustus to injury. Neither setback did anything to deter the hosts: Ludlam soon snuck over for their second try after the ball was again sent fizzing through hands. Marcus Smith clipped a penalty over to bring the visitors within four and at the other end, Matt Proctor slipped spectacularly after being wrong-footed by a bouncing cross kick. Paul Hill, who came off the bench for Carey minutes before, took a blow to the head from Courtney Lawes; Hill went off and the referee, Matthew Carley, switched to uncontested scrums. George Furbank soon stretched a hand for the line for Northampton’s third try. The home team led by nine and only a crunching hit by Furbank stopped Andre Esterhuizen from tearing over the try-line, but a cute cross-kick by Smith saw Joe Marchant pull off an outrageous leap, catch and pass inside for Huw Jones, the full-back, who streaked under the posts. It was a glorious piece of skill by Marchant that survived a TMO check for a foot in touch. Perhaps fans of the darker arts did not appreciate it, but few of those present seemed to mind about the uncontested scrums. Northampton smashed over for their fourth, bonus-point try from Alex Waller inside the final five minutes of the half after a couple of a crushing carries by Ludlam. Saints seemed set fair but it was Quins that roared out of the second-half blocks. Alex Dombrandt celebrated his 25th birthday by picking an excellent line to crash over for their third try and when Cadan Murley sped over for their own bonus-point try and Smith converted, Quins hit the front. An ill-judged high hit by Santiago Garcia Botta on Furbank saw Carley produce a yellow card and Quins competed impressively to maintain their advantage until the Argentinian prop returned. With two points in it and 10 minutes remaining, it was impossible to imagine an undramatic conclusion. A couple of Saints’ turnovers felt significant: and when the Quins replacement Luke Wallace was penalised, Grayson nervelessly nailed the penalty, and the Franklin’s Gardens crowd went wild. Matson said: “With two minutes to go and you’re in front, you think: jeez, we could sneak away here. But that’s the great thing about the game, isn’t it? I just saw Boydy, who’s an old friend of mine, and we can sit back and go: “That was a good game of rugby.” Quins must now face Gloucester and then Exeter, both playoff rivals. There will be more good games to come.",Sport/Sport,Late Grayson penalty sees Northampton edge thriller with Harlequins,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/29/late-grayson-penalty-sees-northampton-edge-thriller-with-harlequins
