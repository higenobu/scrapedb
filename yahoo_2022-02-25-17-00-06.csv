2/25/2022,"The conflict in Ukraine and backpedaling were the main themes of Tucker Carlson’s show Thursday after the Fox News host was slammed for defending Russian President Vladimir Putin, and dragging U.S. President Joe Biden, in the lead-up to Russia's invasion of the Eastern European nation. “I don’t think anybody approves of what Putin did yesterday,"" he said. ""I certainly don’t.” That wasn't the note he sounded 24 hours earlier, just before tanks rolled over the border between Ukraine and Belarus, bombs detonated over the capital, Kyiv, and families sought shelter in underground subway stations. As on-scene reporters stressed the gravity of the situation, and American media outlets reacted with equal solemnity, one notable exception emerged: Fox News. As Putin started a war, the conservative news outlet's top talent sympathized with the former KGB agent-turned-despot over the U.S. and its allies — a stunning move even for the network that provided a megaphone for Trump's Big Lie about a ""rigged"" election. But on Wednesday, any expectation that Carlson and Fox News colleague Laura Ingraham would tone down the pro-Putin disinformation they'd been feeding their viewers quickly evaporated. Instead, Carlson used Wednesday's show to wave the flag not for the U.S. or its suffering ally Ukraine, but for Putin. Questioning why we should hate the autocratic and isolated Russian ruler, the ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" host discounted Ukraine as “a pure client state of the United States State Department.” That same evening, Ingraham blamed the conflict on the “weakness and the incompetence” of the Biden administration, a position echoed by a number of Republican elected officials, and called Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy's desperate appeal for Putin to stop the attack a “pathetic display."" You read that correctly. She was mocking a last-ditch effort to save lives and country. Characterizing the Russian advance as a ""border dispute,"" Carlson preferred to lay blame on the opposition: Democrats had conditioned folks ""to hate Putin,"" he said, going so far as to urge his viewers to rethink their feelings about good ol' Vlad: ""Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity?"" The answer, to Carlson's mind, is no. (Nothing, not even jailing antiwar protesters, is worse than submitting cable news hosts to criticism.) Which makes Putin the good guy and Biden the bad. And since Joe likes Ukraine, Fox News logic demands irrationally turning on your own country and supporting the enemy to ... own the libs? Never mind the unprovoked attack was soon condemned by multiple heads of state, or that it prompted sanctions and sparked protests from Sydney to St. Petersburg. Carlson had all the footing he needed: Former President Donald Trump had already referred to Putin as a “genius” for his aggression in the region, just as he had spoken highly for years of the man whose meddling helped him into the White House. By primetime Thursday, Carlson had changed his tune: “Vladimir Putin started this war,"" he said. ""He is to blame tonight for what we’re seeing tonight in the Ukraine.” Then he quickly pivoted. “The question is ... how should the United States respond to what he has done? Within minutes of the outbreak of the war last night the usual liars on television began leveraging this tragedy for partisan political gain ... it’s contemptible. But we're going to ignore that tonight and talk about what matters.” As much as Carlson wanted folks to ignore his previous week (OK, five years) of blowing kisses at Russia's strongman, his love letters were scattered about social media. Russian state media reportedly aired his flattering commentary with subtitles to show Putin's subjects how Americans really feel, as well as an article titled, ""Tucker Carlson wonders why U.S. elites hate Putin."" The pro-Russia stance of the network's ""opinion"" hosts created quite the cognitive dissonance with Fox's news operations. Whiplash kicked in Wednesday when the network moved from mortar blasts to partisan chatter. Trey Yingst in Kyiv reported from under a helmet against the backdrop of sirens, then host Shannon Bream threw to White House correspondent Kevin Corke, who immediately situated the reactions of American politicians within the realm of Democrat/Republican squabbling. ""Barack Obama, you may recall, said to Mitt Romney’s suggestion back in 2012 that the Kremlin was America’s number one enemy that 'the 1980s called, they want their foreign policy back,'"" Corke said. ""Joe Biden at the time said we were mired in a Cold War mind-set if you listened to Romney. Hillary Clinton said his thinking was dated and backward..."" As for reaction from inside the Kremlin? You'll have to ask Carlson. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",Politics/LA Times,"On the eve of war, Tucker Carlson defended Putin.

2/25/2022,"By Natalia Zinets and Aleksandar Vasovic KYIV/MARIUPOL, Ukraine (Reuters) -Ukrainian forces battled Russian invaders on three sides on Thursday after Moscow unleashed the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two, prompting tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. After Russian President Vladimir Putin declared war in a pre-dawn televised address, explosions and gunfire were heard through the day in Ukraine's capital and elsewhere in the country, with at least 70 people reported killed. The assault brought a calamitous end to weeks of fruitless diplomatic efforts by Western leaders to avert war over Russian demands for a redrawing of post-Cold War security arrangements in Europe. ""This is a premeditated attack,"" U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters at the White House as he unveiled harsh new sanctions, coordinated with allies, against Russian banks, oligarchs and state companies. ""Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war. And now he and his country will bear the consequences,"" he said. In his address, Putin said he had ordered ""a special military operation"" to protect people, including Russian citizens, subjected to ""genocide"" in Ukraine - an accusation the West calls baseless propaganda. ""And for this we will strive for the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine,"" Putin said. After nightfall, a picture was emerging of fierce fighting across multiple fronts. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy late on Thursday ordered a general mobilization, to be carried out within 90 days, ""to ensure the defence of the state"". An adviser to the Ukrainian presidential office said Russian forces had captured the Chernobyl former nuclear power plant, just 90 km (60 miles) north of Kyiv. The plant is along the shortest route from the Ukrainian capital to Belarus, where Moscow has staged troops. There was also fighting at Hostomel airport, just outside Kyiv, where Russian paratroopers landed. A Ukrainian official later said the airfield had been recaptured, while a senior U.S. defence official said Russian forces were advancing closer to Kyiv. Heavy exchanges of fire were also reported in the regions of Sumy and Kharkiv in the northeast and Kherson in the south. The highway heading west out of Kyiv, home to 3 million people, was choked with traffic across five lanes as residents sought to escape, fearful of bombardments while stuck in their cars. The U.N. refugee agency said an estimated 100,000 Ukrainians had fled their homes. Thousands were crossing into neighbouring countries, including Romania, Moldova, Poland and Hungary. Some 57 people were killed and 169 were wounded on Thursday, Ukraine's health minister said, while the interior ministry said 13 border guards died when a Russian vessel shelled Ukraine's Zmiinyi Island, south of the Black Sea port of Odessa. 'NEW IRON CURTAIN' The day began with missiles raining down on targets across Ukraine and reports of troops and armour pouring across the borders from Russia and Belarus to the north and east. Zelenskiy called on Ukrainians to defend their country and said arms would be given to anyone prepared to fight. ""What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft. This is the sound of a new Iron Curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world,"" Zelenskiy said. Putin, after referring earlier in his speech to Russia's powerful nuclear arsenal, warned: ""Whoever tries to hinder us... should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history."" Asked whether that threat was tantamount to threatening Russian use of nuclear weapons, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was indeed understood as such, adding that Putin should also understand that NATO was a nuclear alliance. Biden has ruled out sending U.S. troops to defend Ukraine, but Washington has reinforced its NATO allies in the region with extra troops and planes. After consulting with the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations, Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned enterprises. Britain also targeted banks, as well as members of Putin's inner circle. European Union leaders said measures would include freezing Russian assets in the 27-nation bloc. China remained out of step, however, rejecting the description of Russia's actions as an ""invasion"". Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers, and both it and Ukraine are among the top exporters of grain. War and sanctions will disrupt economies around the world already facing a crisis as they emerge from the coronavirus pandemic. European stocks dived to nine-month lows, but U.S. stocks ended higher after Biden's sanctions announcement. Brent oil earlier surged past $100/barrel for the first time since 2014. [MKTS/GLOB] [O/R] 'HANG THEM FROM BRIDGES' Putin said he did not plan a military occupation, only to disarm Ukraine and purge it of nationalists, and his endgame remains unclear. The senior U.S. defence official said Washington believed the invasion was intended to ""decapitate"" Zelenskiy's government. But it is hard to see Ukrainians accepting leadership installed by Moscow. ""I think we must fight all those who invade our country so strongly,"" said one man stuck in traffic trying to leave Kyiv. ""I would hang every single one of them from bridges."" A democratic nation of 44 million people, Ukraine is Europe's biggest country by area after Russia itself. It voted for independence at the fall of the Soviet Union and has recently stepped up efforts to join NATO and the European Union, aspirations that infuriate Moscow. Putin, who denied for months that he was planning an invasion, has called Ukraine an artificial construct carved from Russia by its enemies - a characterisation Ukrainians see as an attempt to erase their more than 1,000-year-old history. While many Ukrainians, particularly in the east, speak Russian as a native language, virtually all identify themselves as Ukrainian. There was also some dissent in Russia. Police detained more than 1,600 taking part in anti-war rallies in 53 cities and authorities threatened to block media reports carrying ""false information"". UKRAINIANS FLEE, SUPPORTERS PROTEST In the southeastern port of Mariupol, near a frontline held by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, local authorities said 26 people were wounded in shelling. Civilians packed bags. ""We are going into hiding,"" a woman said. Ukraine's ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, said its forces had downed two Russian helicopters and seven other Russian aircraft and destroyed several Russian trucks, and a platoon from Russia's 74th Motor Rifles Brigade had surrendered. Russia's defence ministry said it had destroyed 83 land-based Ukrainian targets and had achieved all its goals, according to Interfax news agency. Protests against Russia's invasion were held in Europe and the United States. At a demonstration in New York's Time Square, Ivana Lotoshynski, who was born in Ukraine, urged solidarity with Ukrainians. ""People are losing their lives right now. Ukrainians are fighting against this regime from Russia and it's really devastating,"" she said. ""Today I think everybody is Ukrainian.""

2/25/2022,"By Kanishka Singh (Reuters) -Satellite imagery taken on Wednesday showed new deployments in western Russia, many of them within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the border with Ukraine and less than 50 miles (80 km) from the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, a private U.S. company said. The images showed field deployment, military convoys, artillery and armored personnel carriers with support equipment and troops. The images released by Maxar Technologies, which has been tracking the buildup of Russian forces for weeks, could not be independently verified by Reuters. Most of the troops and equipment were positioned in smaller unit-sized formations on farm land and along tree lines, Maxar said on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the U.S. company's images had shown a new deployment of more than 100 military vehicles and dozens of troop tents in southern Belarus near the Ukraine border. Ukraine declared a state of emergency on Wednesday and Moscow said separatists in the east had asked for help to repel ""aggression"" as the United States stepped up efforts to deter an all-out invasion by imposing fresh sanctions. Russia has consistently denied it plans to invade its neighbor but President Vladimir Putin has ordered Russian troops into eastern Ukraine for what he called peacekeeping after Moscow recognized the separatist regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent.
