1/30/2022,"Liverpool are poised to complete the signing of Luis Díaz from Porto after he completed the first part of his medical in Argentina. They will pay a guaranteed €40m (£33.3m) for the winger plus a possible €20m in add-ons. A visa application for the Colombia international, who is in Argentina for Tuesday’s World Cup qualifier, is under way and he is ready to sign a five-year contract. Jürgen Klopp is a big admirer of the 25-year-old and Liverpool had planned a summer move but accelerated their pursuit after it became apparent Porto would sell amid interest from Tottenham.  The failure to complete a deal for Díaz is the latest blow to Spurs, who also missed out on Adama Traoré to Barcelona, but they are closing on a deal to sign Dejan Kulusevski from Juventus and are hopeful they will also strike an agreement to bring in Rodrigo Bentancur from the Italian club. A verbal agreement is in place for Kulusevski to join Spurs on loan with a mandatory summer purchase for about €40m (£33.3m), including add-ons, if Antonio Conte’s side qualify for the Champions League and the Sweden international has made a specified number of appearances. Tottenham would pay a loan fee of about €5m for Kulusevski, who can play on the wing or as a No 10 and has been more in than out of the starting XI this season. The 21-year-old cost Juventus €35m from Atalanta in January 2020. Spurs are also working to complete a deal for the midfielder Bentancur and have submitted an offer which would guarantee Juventus €19m, with about €6m in add-ons to follow. Juventus rejected a similar offer from Aston Villa for the Uruguay international in recent days. They now have Denis Zakaria lined up to join from Borussia Mönchengladbach if Bentancur leaves. The Tottenham managing director of football, Fabio Paratici, worked for 11 years at Juventus and is trying to deliver the signings demanded by Conte. He is also working to move players out. A deal to take Bryan Gil on loan to Valencia is closest and Paratici is also hopeful that solutions can be found to find clubs for Tanguy Ndombele and Dele Alli.",Sport/Football,Liverpool set to sign Díaz as Spurs close on Kulusevski and bid for Bentancur,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/30/liverpool-luis-diaz-tottenham-kulusevski-bentancur-transfer-news
1/30/2022,"Hosting the Winter Olympics during a pandemic was always going to test the Chinese government, by putting its ever-growing ability to exercise political control and virus containment on a collision course with its enthusiasm for international prestige and status. The 2022 Winter Games, which open on Friday, are being held at a time of particularly intense western criticism of China over human rights abuses, from the mass persecution of Uyghurs in far western Xinjiang – labelled a genocide by the United States – and other groups including Tibetans, to the crushing of Hong Kong’s freedoms.  China denies human rights abuses, but activists have dubbed the gathering in Beijing the “Genocide Games”, and western powers from the US to the UK have announced a diplomatic boycott of the opening ceremony. The exiled campaign group World Uyghur Congress urged: “No one should want another Olympics like this.” There is so little trust of the host nation that many countries have told their athletes to take burner phones, and cyber security experts warned a health app for Olympians could spy on them and steal health and other personal data. Further censure has come from environmentalists who have warned for years about the negative impact of hosting the Games – which need a lot of water for snow and ice – in an area of intense water scarcity. Yet Beijing weathered the controversy when it hosted the Summer Olympics, in 2008, said Susan Brownell of University of Missouri-St Louis, an expert on Chinese sports who was in China for those Games. Then, high-profile protests dogged the global torch relay, violent suppression of protests in Tibet put Chinese oppression there on the news agenda, there was pressure on leaders to skip the opening ceremony and environmentalists warned about the intense pollution that shrouded Beijing. But, once the competition began, the focus shifted to the athletes. Beijing’s calculation is, no doubt, that the same thing will happen this year. “Right now, the political and investigative journalists have the front page, but once the Games start, it will be the sports journalists,” Brownell said. Covid has conveniently spared Beijing any worries about protests from the stands, which would have been the most likely arena for political activism in a country where public demonstrations by citizens are in effect banned. Competitors and the few other foreigners given permission to come to Beijing, including coaches, support staff and journalists, will fly into a sealed-off Olympic world, a “closed loop” of venues and hotels in just three locations, connected by their own transport vehicles, travelling in their own lanes. It is staffed by Chinese workers who are not allowed to return to their own homes without a long period of quarantine. Authorities are so bent on total separation that they have warned Beijing residents against helping Olympians if a loop vehicle crashes. For Victor Cha, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC, these rules seem like a metaphor for how China’s communist leadership wants the Games to play out overall – in a closed system fully under their control. “Covid has really given them the excuse to completely lock down everything. They want to have complete control over the picture of the Olympics and that helps,” he said. There will be an official international protest, in the form of a diplomatic boycott by western governments including the US and the UK, but their absence is unlikely to be a major headache for officials in Beijing, or feature prominently in news coverage through the Games. “They shrug off the diplomatic boycotts. It feeds the domestic narrative that the west is trying to steal China’s moment in sun, and they can say leaders are not coming anyway because of Covid.” The shutdown of international participation in the Games has put particular political pressure on the athletes, now the only people with a platform to make a statement. “It is impossible to separate sports from business and politics. More than a big sporting occasion, this is also a political event,” said Mark Dreyer, author of Sporting Superpower: An Insider’s View on China’s Quest to Be the Best. The human cost of China’s political controls has been thrown into the spotlight in a very personal way for athletes by the treatment of one of the country’s best-known, most successful Olympians, tennis star Peng Shuai. Last year, she vanished from public view after accusing a former senior Communist party official of coercing her into a sexual relationship, and her allegations were scrubbed from the internet. After international outrage, she made a series of stage-managed public appearances inside China, including with Olympic officials, which have done little to assuage concern about whether she is acting with free will. Her treatment was highlighted by protesters at this month’s Australian Open, who wore T-shirts saying simply “Where is Peng Shuai?”. Organisers banned them, then backtracked on the ban. Perhaps concerned by the swell of support for Peng, China has taken the unusual step of going beyond the International Olympic Committee bans on athletes taking political stands. If they break Chinese laws, with “behaviour or speech that is against the Olympic spirit”, athletes will face “certain punishment”, Yang Shu, a member of the Beijing Organising Committee, told a news conference this month.This rhetoric may be intended mostly as deterrent, analysts say. An athlete’s arrest over a political protest would be shocking, and likely to become an enduring image of an event that Beijing wants remembered as a sporting and logistical triumph. Rob Koehler of Global Athlete, an advocacy group for sportspeople, said they have reluctantly advised competitors to save protests or criticism of China for when they have finished competing and returned home. “That is the hardest and most outrageous thing we have had to say, given how hard we pushed for them to have the right to basic freedom of expression,” he said. Even if China manages to side-step an inflammatory protest – or an inflammatory response – at the Games, the virus that might once have looked like a gift to a government bent on control has become more of a threat to a successful Olympics, with the highly contagious Omicron circulating widely. If an outbreak knocks out high-profile athletes, or significantly diminishes the number of competitors, it could start to undermine the events. Beijing announced on Saturday that, even before the Games had begun, the number of cases in the Olympic village had jumped from two to 19. Cases among athletes and team officials exceeded those among media and “other stakeholders” for the first time. There has already been disruption to qualifying competitions after athletes tested positive. At the US figure skating championships, Brownell said some athletes developed Covid between competitions, and despite taking extreme precautions. “They had been masking, observing social distancing; the pairs team had only private lessons in the rink with their coach and didn’t know where they had got it. It created quite a panic at the championships themselves,” Brownell said. Ironically, China’s success with controlling earlier variants of Covid has left it particularly vulnerable, public health experts say. Its domestic vaccines are ineffective against Omicron, and because there have still been only a few cases in a country of more than 1.4 billion people, there is almost no natural immunity. A vulnerable population and an unevenly distributed healthcare system makes the potential of a Covid outbreak terrifying. The devastation that ripped through Wuhan in the earliest days of the pandemic could still be unleashed on the rest of China, and fear of this has almost certainly contributed to the intense testing and quarantine rules. These factors have affected how the rest of the world, or at least audiences in markets such as the US, will experience the Games. The broadcaster NBC is keeping its commentators at home, covering Beijing from thousands of miles away. Restrictions on media coverage of the last Games, the Summer Olympics in Japan held last year after a year’s delay, diminished the viewing experience for many of the millions of people who wanted to follow from home. “My personal feeling was that coverage of the Tokyo Games really lost something. It was pretty clear they didn’t invest the same amount of money, the coverage was not as glossy and aesthetically pleasing,” said Brownell. “Now, with commentators not actually being in Beijing, that’s going to be even more marked. I think the pandemic restrictions could have an impact on how the TV and social media audiences see these Olympics.” There may also be less promotion. In a sign perhaps of how these Olympics are among the most controversial in recent decades, sponsors who pay eye-watering sums to be connected with the Games have not been flaunting those links in the west as they have done in the run-up to previous iterations of the competition. For years China has forced heavy penalties on sports personalities, companies and managers who risked the slightest public criticism of its politics. A 2019 tweet by Daryl Morey, then general manager of the Houston Rockets, supporting pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong was estimated to have cost the National Basketball Association hundreds of millions of dollars after he was allowed to stay in his job. But sponsors in the west are wary of being accused of pandering to China. Perhaps because they are caught between Beijing and Washington, there has been no pre-Games campaign to spur excitement in the US from the card payment giant Visa, Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble, the Wall Street Journal reported. The framing in China of the Beijing Winter Games, however, is drastically different from that outside the country – focused on igniting national pride, and using the Games to boost participation in sport and expand the domestic winter sports industry. Chinese citizens’ participation in sport has been on the rise since the 2008 Games, said Shushu Chen, a lecturer in sport policy and management at the University of Birmingham, who has been tracking the impact of the Summer Games in Beijing and London. Chen noted that compared with London, residents in Beijing were “ostensibly more positive about the inspirational effects of the Olympic Games, which can perhaps be explained by sociocultural contextual differences between the two cases”. Dreyer, who has lived in Beijing since 2007, observed that the wave of enthusiasm in China for winter sports began in 2015, when the country won the hosting rights. “China will not top the medals table this year, but it will probably do better than it has ever done before. And it will have many more athletes competing in the Winter Games than previously.” Inside China, the Games are already being hailed as a triumph for Beijing and its ability to rally against the virus, and against western criticism. Internationally, these Games may be remembered very differently.",News/World news,"Sport, politics and Covid collide at the Beijing Winter Olympics",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/sport-politics-and-covid-collide-at-the-beijing-winter-olympics
1/30/2022,"Some 20 years ago, Joe Rogan was a reality TV host, fronting Fear Factor on NBC, in which hapless contestants faced dangerous, scary or gross stunts.  Now he’s one of the most powerful figures in American media, though often little acknowledged or actively shunned by the country’s coastal elites. He is sometimes left-leaning but says he detests identity politics and political correctness. He appears committed to some forms of social justice but is amenable to conservatives. The Joe Rogan Experience podcast – the vehicle for his enormous wealth and power – intersperses comedy, politics, criticism of the media, interviews and discourses on topics ranging from cage-fighting to psychedelics and quantum mechanics. Last week, Rogan, a martial arts enthusiast and one-time Bernie Sanders-endorser, collided with rock veteran Neil Young. The 76-year-old Canadian singer objected to the music streaming giant Spotify giving a platform to Rogan, 54, who has been accused of promoting falsehoods about Covid vaccines. The Joe Rogan Experience, which can run for up to three hours, is the No 1 podcast on Spotify. After Young issued an ultimatum, Spotify chose to go with Rogan, who received $100m for distribution rights from the Swedish company in 2020. For Spotify, it was an obvious choice. Streaming is highly competitive, with low margins. Apple, Google and Amazon are competing for market share. In its latest filing, Spotify reported 172m paying subscribers, up from 144m when it signed Rogan. When it comes to plotting a lucrative future in modern media, Young, a cultural legend, was simply not competitive. Nor was the fight with Young – joined by Joni Mitchell – the only major headline Rogan created this week. He also interviewed the rightwing Canadian academic Jordan Peterson, triggering a deluge of coverage over comments about race and the climate crisis. Not that Rogan cared. Nor would it bend the arc of his astonishing rise. Rogan got his start as a magician on Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco. He moved to Massachusetts, where he competed in taekwondo. He switched to comedy and was nicknamed “Little Ball of Anger”. He went for the soft flesh, skewering the fable of Noah’s Ark: “Noah was 600 years old and a drunk!” he would tell audiences. Back on the west coast he was cast in the 90s sitcom NewsRadio, playing a conspiracy-prone dude named Joe. In 1997, he started working for Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) as a commentator. He moved to reality TV, then in its infancy, as a host of Fear Factor, inviting contestants to engage in tests involving worms, flies and snakes. After 9/11, as commentators worried that culture had changed forever, the NFL invited U2 to play the Super Bowl halftime show. The names of those who died in the attacks scrolled behind the band. But in a memorable act of counter-programming, Rogan presented Fear Factor: Playboy Playmates Edition, replete with a countdown clock to the second half. Rogan prized away 11 million viewers. Since then he has only increased in popularity, and accrued cultural power, caring little for taste or perceived notions and winning a legion of fans attuned to new media platforms and dismissive of old elites. “The social media stars know how to tell a story, it’s all about presentation, whereas journalists employ some of the most boring writing ever. It’s all formula,” noted cultural critic Bob Lefsetz last week. “Young people don’t even bother to read the paper and they never will. They’re going to be reached another way.” Rogan’s wealth has grown. He has moved from California to a $14m mansion outside Austin, Texas – destination of choice for tech entrepreneurs. Nor is he alone. A flipside to Rogan – though closer than either might think – is Charlamagne tha God, aka Lenard Larry McKelvey, a hip-hop star and morning radio host. Democratic politicians flock to Charlamagne, frequently getting burned in the process. He recently asked vice-president Kamala Harris who was really “running the country?” Both Rogan and Charlamagne are just doing their jobs, says media professor Robert Thompson at Syracuse University. “The job description is practically to say the kinds of things that will almost, but not quite, get you fired. Eventually you cross the line because the line is not very well-defined.” Neil Young, Thompson says, could find that he needs to be careful what he wishes for. “However noble Young’s intentions are, Rogan is contained by a subscription wall. Spotify has distribution rights but Rogan owns his show. Fire him and he could potentially have even greater distribution than he’s got now.” In 2019, a year before Rogan signed to Spotify, his podcast was downloaded about 190m times in a month. Elon Musk came on. The pair smoked a joint. The far-right conspiracist Alex Jones came on in 2020. Daniel Ek, chief executive and co-founder of Spotify, defended Rogan to the FT: “We want creators to create. It’s what they do best. We’re not looking to play a role in what they should say.” In recent months, Rogan has invited anti-vax guests including far-right Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who described the deworming medication ivermectin as a viable Covid treatment. There are still some limits – even for Rogan. On Wednesday, Spotify slightly changed its tune, mindful that it may bear some responsibility for Covid-19 misinformation. “We want all the world’s music and audio content to be available to Spotify users,” it said. “With that comes great responsibility in balancing both safety for listeners and freedom for creators. We have detailed content policies in place and we’ve removed over 20,000 podcast episodes related to Covid since the start of the pandemic.” But does Rogan share such beliefs? Thompson acknowledges that many believe stars like Rogan or Fox News’ Tucker Carlson are performing an act, successfully gaining money and influence. “They’re staying in character, other people are supporting and believing them. So I guess in the end whether it’s an act or not is something we will never know and therefore doesn’t really matter.”",News/US news,Joe Rogan: rise of a highly controversial cultural power,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/joe-rogan-neil-young-feud-spotify-music-streaming-industry
1/30/2022,"Residents of a small Alabama city will on Tuesday hold a town hall meeting to discuss claims by community members and activist groups that local police have pursued excessive policing for profit.  Officers in Brookside, a former mining town 20 min outside Birmingham, have been accused of generating hundreds of thousands of dollars in city revenue through ticketing, towing and other traffic-related fines, despite Brookside having no traffic lights and a few two-lane roads, news site AL.com first reported. With a population of less than 2,000 and a median income of less than $40,000, in 2020 Brookside generated more than $610,000 in fines and forfeitures from drivers, a 640% increase over two years and almost half of city revenue. Towing ballooned from 50 cars in 2018 to 789 in 2020, with residents reporting that they were required to pay thousands of dollars to get vehicles back. “Brookside is a poster child for policing for profit,” Carla Crowder, director of the nonprofit Alabama Appleseed Center for Law & Justice, told AL.com. “We are not safer because of it.” Officers have been cited in at least five federal lawsuits for manufacturing reasons for traffic stops, “making up laws”, overcharging fines, using racist language and other misconduct allegations, AL.com said. “This city is a ticking, ticking time bomb waiting to explode,” Juandalynn Givan, a Democratic state representative, told WVTM, an NBC affiliate in Birmingham. Givan has called on several officials to resign, including Brookside’s mayor, Mike Bryan, and is holding the town hall so residents can air their concerns. “It’s the wild, wild west, and they created their own wild, wild west,” she said. On Saturday, Givan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Despite reporting only 55 serious crimes from 2011 to 2018, with no reports of homicide or rape, the Brookside police department under chief Mike Jones greatly expanded, hiring one officer for every 144 residents. The average size of a force in Alabama is one officer for every 588 people. Jones resigned on Tuesday. Brookside officers also received SWAT training and riot gear, according to residents who said officers parked a riot control vehicle outside the community center. Issues with Brookside police have been escalating for years, according to several residents, but many have been hesitant to officially pursue complaints given the cost of doing so and difficulty of contesting fines in courts. “I saw the same attitude in every officer and every person,” Ramon Perez, who tried to fight several tickets in court but ultimately paid the fines, told AL.com. “That’s why I hesitated to fight it. They were doing the same thing to every person that was there. They own the town.” Crowder said: “This is shocking. No one can objectively look at this and conclude this is good government that is keeping us safer.”",News/US news,Alabama city to investigate policing for profit accusations against officers,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/30/alabama-city-policing-for-profit-brookside
1/30/2022,"Ithink that there are some parts of our language that are worth defending to the hilt, but it seems, sadly, that not everyone feels so strongly. According to research from an organisation called Perspectus Global, many longstanding phrases and sayings are falling by the wayside, unused, or simply unknown, by younger people. Nail your colours to the mast; casting pearls before swine; a nod’s as good as a wink – all seem destined for the knacker’s yard (as is that). I’m all for developments in our language, but what a shame if such rich sayings were lost. I for one will go to the barricades to defend them (any befuddled young people can look that up on the internet).  One phrase I wouldn’t expend any energy on trying to save is “hot button issues”. This is becoming ever more intrusive and I imagine is wielded to instil some dynamism into headlines and writing. Well, it doesn’t. Crucial or vital will still do just as well, so please desist. For reasons best known to myself, I was recently reading the back of a Yeo Valley Organic yoghurt package, offering the chance to win a Brompton bike. Wonderful bits of engineering, I hope you agree. I was intrigued to see that one of its models came with an “intelligent pedal assist” and wonder whether this is what a layman might call a motor. If any marketers out there could get in touch, I’d be eternally grateful. And finally, given the tension between Russia, Ukraine and the western alliance, I wonder: whither chicken kiev? As the new orthodoxy seems to suggest that Kiev is now Kyiv, is it time for supermarkets to instigate a massive rebranding? I’m just asking.

1/30/2022,"Twenty years ago, the American psychologist Tessa West began arriving early to the department store at which she worked, so she could avoid the salespeople she spent most of her time with. Really, she was hoping to escape just one colleague – someone with whom she disagreed about shop-floor etiquette. (Her: don’t steal clients. The co-worker: why not?) In the early mornings, West could be sure they wouldn’t run into each other, saving her from stress and anxiety, which can lead to ill health. “It’s not that I thought anything bad was going to happen,” she recalls, via Zoom. “It was the not-knowing what would happen,” and “the increase in heart-rate” that comes with that uncertainty. Soon the situation became so preoccupying that West quit, not so much resolving the conflict as bypassing it altogether. “Did it work? Sure. But how much energy did that take up? A lot.” West, who is now 40, is a professor of psychology at New York University, where she runs the West Interpersonal Perception Lab, a research unit that studies, broadly, how we deal with each other, and how those interactions affect our mental and physiological states. “I spent the first 10 years of my career doing basic science on how people communicate,” she says, which included “a lot of time in labs evoking horrible experiences to see what people do.” (One study involved West sitting participants in a chair and “being mean” to them, to measure their stress responses.) Before long, she noticed that a lot of what she was observing could be captured in the workplace: how individuals influence groups, how status affects persuasion and morale, how anxiety affects everyday relations. And the more she researched, the more she realised that, like her younger self, very few of us know how to resolve everyday conflict at work.  “Like, I don’t know,” she says. “Did you ever take a course to learn what to do when someone’s being a low-level asshole?” West and I are meeting to discuss Jerks at Work, her new book, in which she explains the types of bad colleagues we encounter in the workplace, and attempts to equip readers with strategies to mend disputes. “Most of us have worked with someone who had an outsized effect on our emotional wellbeing,” she writes. “To cope, we’ve tried a few tactics: venting to friends, disengaging from the social scene at work, gossiping about the person in the hopes our bosses will learn – via the grapevine – just how miserable we are.” None of this tends to help. Typically, neither does the alternative, retaliating through confrontation, which often “ends in more conflict, since most people don’t enjoy having their flaws spelled out to them in excruciating detail.” Sometimes we think of the ability to argue as displaying superiority or courage, and not a worrying volatility and lack of emotional control. West argues we’re all capable of being poor colleagues. A lot of workjerkery is rooted in innate feelings and behaviours: laziness, jealousy, the various emotional fissures we experience in marriages, repackaged for office life. (On needling pettiness at work, one recent viral tweet read: “The feeling of forwarding an email you have been accused of not sending is probably the same as winning a duel.”) We all have our embarrassing weaknesses – we can all be jerks. “Some of us get overwhelmed, so we ghost people, do a disappearing act. At work, those folks are more likely to be free-riders, or neglectful bosses. Others get anxious, so they micromanage.” Problems arise whenever a group works together. “I’ve seen Nobel laureates act the same way in meetings that I saw on the shop floor,” West says. Tantrums, attacks on reputation, hotshot egos, credit stealing, microagression, passive aggression, conniving attempts to get ahead… it affects us deeply. Once, when West was tasked with re-arranging her faculty’s office plan, she faced kickback from colleagues upset at the changes. “People would come to me in private and say, ‘There’s no way I can share a wall with this person.’ They cared more about that – how many feet away from their nemesis they were – than whether or not they got promoted.” She later caught a co-worker “walking down the hall with a two-gallon bottle of water that was clearly full of urine.” West realised he was pissing in his office to avoid bumping into a colleague in the toilet. All of this would be amusing if it weren’t so damaging. “A lot of us worry about acute stressors – those big life events, when we can physically feel our hearts racing and our palms sweating,” West says. “But the biggest predictor of health outcomes is daily, low-level stuff.” Incessant stress sustained for three to five days is enough to affect your immune system, making you more susceptible to mild illnesses, like colds. As that stress cascades over years, studies have shown scarier problems to emerge: obesity, impotence, cancer, high blood pressure, heart disease. “If you’re feeling butterflies in your stomach because you know you’re going to run into someone who’s going to say something rude…” West says. “That adds up.” In a 2014 study, West asked parents to deliver a talk to strangers, an experience known to induce anxiety, and then had them sit with their children, all of whom were between six and 12 months old. “We found that the babies showed physiological alignment with their parents’ stress responses,” West says. “If a mum had an elevated heart rate, the baby caught that stress.” (This kind of emotional transference can be termed stress contagion.) “And if you told the mum to try to regulate it, to push it down, the effect was even worse,” she continues. “So if you get really stressed with your boss at work and you try to suppress it, if you don’t talk about it with your family, if you think that that’s going to solve it…” She shakes her head. “Doesn’t. Work. It leaks out of you through all of these non-verbal communication channels. You show it in your face. You sigh. And your family becomes attuned. It affects your relationships with them. But it also affects their physiology. Their stress. In their bodies.” She looks concerned. “That part is terrifying, that if you don’t solve your problems at work, your kids are going to suffer, your spouse is going to suffer, in ways you don’t even realise.” It is likely you’ve had bad colleagues. It is also likely you’ve had a bad boss. Everyone has a story – don’t you? Perhaps it involves micromanagement, or neglect, or small acts of soul-crushing criticism, or larger harassment and abuse. Perhaps the malevolence was overt. Perhaps it was more subtle, so that if you were to later describe it to friends it would seem minor and inconsequential, and you might come off as appearing hypersensitive. (This is true of so much workplace conflict; often a jerk is a jerk for a series of small, collective actions, not for one colossally atrocious deed.) Sometimes, bosses don’t realise the effect they’re having on workers, and it is helpful to remain modest about their levels of self-awareness. An acquaintance recently told me she “once had a female boss who did all of the following in an open-plan office, in front of both male and female colleagues: 1. Asked me what menstrual products I used. 2. Asked me what bra size I wore. 3. Asked me when I was planning to have children. 4. Told me off for asking ‘How was your weekend?’ on a Monday morning, because she didn’t like personal questions.” Often, managers become managers for one of two reasons: they had excelled at their previous job, or they had drifted around an organisation long enough for higher-ups to finally announce, “OK, it is time.” Frequently, a manager has no experience of managing people before they are required to, which can be disastrous. “Very few managers are trained,” West says. (Sometimes it is because their managers weren’t trained.) “And if you get so far up at work and you still suck at this, it’s a bit embarrassing. You don’t like to admit it. It’s like a dark secret… Once you get to a certain career stage, it feels patronising to take a ‘How to Get Along with Others’ class.” In the book, she writes, “A lot of jerk at work problems result from poor leadership” – it is up to a manager to transform an undermined or eroded culture. In West’s view, we undervalue how much communication affects the workplace, and she is riled by the fact this learnable skill is rarely taught. Why aren’t workers mandatorily coached in conflict management? she wonders. Why, during interviews, is our focus on bottom-line productivity rather than how well they might function within a larger whole? “There are some basic skills,” West says, of bosses, “like how to check in on a team to make sure no one is free-riding; how not to enable people who kiss up and kick down. Little things managers should do, they’re simple, they don’t require charisma or mind-reading or magical empathy or any of those kinds of soft skills – they just require small changes in behaviour. Obvious shit, really. But so many of us don’t do it because nobody told us to.” The lasting shift to remote work brought on by the pandemic has been kind to jerks in some ways and terrible in others. Colleagues who once benefited from the slippery, informal workplace conversations that were allowed to occur in office environments have been hampered by Zoom calls, which involve structure and multiple attendees – it is difficult to bitch about a colleague if your target is with you on-screen. But others have thrived. With physical distance, it has become easier for neglectful bosses to neglect. (West: “Bosses should never assume no news is good news.”) At home, shirkers shirk, and micromanagers send emails around the clock, because what does the pandemic workday look like any more? Recently, West attended a department video conference in which she says one colleague – a bulldozer digitally, if not in person – dominated by yelling, so that he appeared on screen more than anyone else, making it difficult for the meeting’s organiser to interrupt and increasing his chances of getting his own way. The Zoom problem (which, remarkably at this stage of working-from-home, remains a common organisational issue) is easily fixed: never use Speaker View, which a single participant can monopolise, and instead break the screen up into a grid, so more voices can be heard. (This is a strategy West describes as “controlling the spotlight”.) Other conflicts are trickier to resolve, though they nearly always involve similarly simple actions. In Jerks at Work, West helps readers understand that a poor office situation isn’t futile – that no matter how constantly unsettled you might feel, there is always a move to make. For micromanagers, she suggests: “Set mutually agreed upon expectations.” For bulldozers: learn to speak first in meetings, and jettison their dominance. For the co-worker on a campaign of terror: create physical and psychological buffers, so as to lessen interaction and anxiety. Much of West’s book leads to the fact that if a colleague is being a jerk to you, it is likely they are being a jerk to other people, too. To this end, West suggests developing a broad network within your organisation – not friends so much as distant contacts with social capital, who, via inter-departmental awareness, might help identify troublemakers.

Kiss up/kick downers ‘These are people who climb to the top by any means necessary,’ writes Tessa West. They tend to be competitive with colleagues at their level and below, reserving good manners only for bosses and people above them. Credit stealers ‘They seem like friends, but they will betray your trust if your idea is good enough to steal.’ This could involve offering to help in the early stages of a project, only to claim it as their work later. Bulldozers ‘Workers who take over the process of group decision-making and render bosses powerless to stop them through fear and intimidation.’ Often they don’t mind making a fuss to get what they want. Don’t mistake their behaviour for leadership. Free riders People who are ‘experts at doing nothing, and getting rewarded for it’. They take on work that seems important but requires little effort. Micromanagers Co-workers who email you at all times of the day. ‘Some do it because they used to have your job and are having a hard time moving on, others because they’re under the false impression that more monitoring equals better performance.’ Neglectful bosses These are managers who follow a three-step process: periods of neglect, a buildup of worry, ‘a surge of control over you to alleviate their anxiety’.If you have a neglectful boss, ‘you will live in a world of chronic uncertainty.’ Gaslighters ‘These workers lie with the intent of deceiving on a grand scale.’ They often isolate victims to get what they want.

1/30/2022,"What is it with Essex and makeovers? It was reported that the county council is to invest more than £300,000 to put its best face on and “challenge people’s preconceived ideas of how they see Essex on TV”. Council bosses wanted to banish thoughts of The Only Way Is Essex, fake tan and fast cars synonymous with the south of the county, replacing them with the Constable-country vistas, windmills and nice thatched cottages of north Essex. We’ve been here before. The council’s drive to combat the Essex stereotype is almost as old as the stereotype itself. In 1997, moves to improve the county’s image were reported in the national press. “Difficulties arise when overseas investors come to the UK, go to competitor locations, and hear jokes about Essex girls having more shoes than books,” said the head of the Essex Economic Partnership, Terry Conder. The council said it often received letters from residents about Essex’s reputation.  As the new millennium arrived, Essex asked the government for permission to spend council tax payers’ money on improving its image and the council started its “Real Essex” tourism campaign. It spent £100,000 on a drive that claimed Essex was, borrowing from the old Mars bar adverts, the place to “work, play and rest”. Like today, they wanted to draw attention to Constable and quaint villages. As with most disquieting elements of British discourse, Essex’s reputation was partly a creation of the rightwing press. Essex man was invented in 1990 via an anonymously published Sunday Telegraph editorial by Simon Heffer. The High Tory columnist grew up watching a new town, South Woodham Ferrers, being built on the edge of marshland downhill from his village. It soon filled up with Cockney emigres. West Ham United usurped the local passion for cricket. After a chance encounter with a loutish, Essex-based City worker on a train into Liverpool Street, he exacted revenge through a gross caricature depicting vomiting at the station. Heffer and other Conservatives didn’t hate Essex man, however. After all, he was the future of the party, and typified the age of upward mobility. His invention was useful for the Tories as it claimed working-class social mobility exclusively for Thatcherism, rather than it being part of a longer process you could trace back to the rise of Keir Hardie and Labour in metropolitan Essex in the late 19th century. The editorial freely admitted, too, that Essex was more an ideal than a location bound by geography: “For spiritual purposes, Essex is to be found all over the newly affluent parts of the outer London suburbs.” Essex man’s less industrious and more materialistic counterpart, Essex girl, soon formed part of the repertoire, rubber-stamped when the Ilford-born Sun journalist Richard Littlejohn ghost-wrote a grim little tome of misogynistic jokes, largely about the promiscuity of women half his age. The power of the Essex girl gave journalists the licence to pry into the sex lives of very young, even underage, girls. So, does the council have a point? Essex, after all, was the fifth least popular English county, according to a YouGov poll in 2018. Kent, our neighbour just over the estuary from where I live in Southend, is frequently near the top of most-visited lists, Essex languishes nearer the bottom. Yet, in making this all about image, the council is ignoring other factors. Essex is still agricultural and, despite the excellent walks along its many public footpaths, much of its countryside is earmarked for private use. Thanks to its proximity to London, much of south Essex is either residential land or green belt. People still flock to Southend and Clacton on bank holidays but, more than tourism, Essex is a success story about the idea of making a home, from the postwar plotland dreamers building in former farmers’ fields to the influx of Eastenders to new towns such as Harlow and Basildon. Essex was inundated by the North Sea flood of 1953, with scores of casualties, and today great concrete sea walls keep the tide at bay in places such as Canvey Island. It is as if the council is following suit, building bigger and bigger defences to keep out the tide of representations. In truth, the stereotype is being eroded by the passage of time. The term Essex girl was taken out of the Oxford Dictionary in 2020. Essex man, so characterised by his daily commute to the City, has had to diversify into home working since the pandemic started. There is no “Real Essex” to be unearthed if we can just crack through the veneer of the mediated, overdone, “fake” Essex of TV lore. Because – and can I just shock you – I have seen Botox fillers in Constable country, too.

1/30/2022,"The private education system, I’m beginning to suspect, just isn’t that into me. I blame myself – I’ve been playing hard to get. Pointing out the divisions in British society that having private schools causes, mentioning how the fees have gone up hugely ahead of inflation and questioning their charitable status in light of that. But still, in my heart I was up for being seduced. I went to private schools and was generally fond of those institutions. As a left-leaning centrist but also a conservative with a small “c” (a woolly position that makes me a massive “c” in the eyes of some), I’m uncomfortable with abolishing, or otherwise driving out of existence, non-profit-making educational institutions. I don’t like banning things in general. I can see the logic that these schools, which undoubtedly provide something good for thousands of children, might nevertheless be causing societal harm overall. But I’m squeamish about taking that logic and commissioning some politicians to turn it into a great big illiberal bunch of laws. So the truth, private education system, is that I was still fluttering my eyelashes at you.  It’s obvious to me now, though, that I am no longer being courted. My good opinion, and that of other woolly centrists, has stopped being attractive to the sector. This became clear when I read about a Times investigation into the new Middle Eastern branches of some major British private schools. It found that some of these offshoot institutions were making politically motivated local changes, such as dropping rules against homophobic bullying in deference to the homophobic regimes in which they are based. A spokeswoman for Royal grammar school, Guildford defended this approach, with reference to that institution’s Qatar branch, saying that the school “must comply with the laws of the country in which we are operating”. Then she added: “Royal grammar school, Guildford will always challenge bullying, whatever the root.” But what if the root is an unjust and bigoted non-democratic regime? They’re not challenging that, they’re accommodating it. They don’t have to set up a school there. What possible reason could there be for doing so if core principles of a liberal education, including equality and mutual respect – presumably the very ethos the school is hoping to bring to this other country – are illegal there? Sherborne school in Dorset insists that “school policies and practices are inclusive and supportive of LGBT people”, which Sherborne school in Doha does not. A former teacher at the Dubai branch of Brighton college has said that they were forced to cover up Israel on maps of the world. And, according to the Times, the Doha branch of King’s college, Taunton changed the definition of bullying set by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) to exclude the word “homophobic”. When I looked at the King’s, Doha website (albeit not from Doha, where it might look different), I actually did see homophobia mentioned there, but I was struck by the juxtaposition of these schools and the NSPCC. These organisations all enjoy charitable status, but for some reason only one of them is not looking to expand globally. The NSPCC isn’t seeking franchises in other countries where the law requires charities to be more equivocal about the issue of cruelty to children. It’s not looking to be flexible about that and so perhaps change its name to something less controversial like the National Society for the Prevention of Killing Children, or even the National Society for the Prevention of Killing Too Many Children, in order to build a client base in a new territory and expand the global outreach of its collection boxes. It’s a powerful reminder of how institutions with charitable status behave when they happen actually to be charities. I hate the new trend of British private schools opening branches abroad because the reason, it seems to me, is naked and unreflecting expansionism. It’s not spreading the original institution’s educational values because, as the Times investigation shows, they’re all too ready to drop those values in order to continue to trade. The desire for revenue obviously plays a part but, as the institutions don’t make profits, I don’t think personal financial rewards for the various executive headteachers or boards of governors are a huge factor. It’s less intelligent than that. It comes from an ill-considered capitalistic urge for growth, nothing more thought through than bigger is better. This is the same reason McDonald’s opened a branch in Soviet Moscow, but that was fine because, as far as I know, McDonald’s has never applied for charitable status. What is astonishing is how, by conducting themselves in this way, private schools seem to have given up on making a meaningful argument to retain that status themselves. They’ve just stopped caring about the views of the likes of me. Is the right wing of the Conservative party now so completely dominant that the idea of keeping the sympathy of anyone on the left or in the centre feels like a waste of time? Or is their interest in convincing me another casualty of the current polarisation of views? When centrist opinion is treated with such contempt by both post-Brexit Tories and post-Corbyn lefties, there’s no point courting it. You never hear from those muddle-headed vacillators any more, the schools must think. The left is now impossible to win round to private education so there’s no point trying. And if people in the Conservative party were ever squeamish about morally vacuous globalisation, they show few signs of it these days. This empty-headed push for more branches, like Our Price in the 80s, Gap in the 90s and Jamie’s Italian in the 2000s, couldn’t be more out of step with the exigencies of the climate crisis, an issue these schools presumably wouldn’t teach their pupils about if opening a branch in Texas. And the notion of spreading British private education to the world, of planting the seeds of our own corrosive class system, like socioeconomic knotweed, all over the planet – as a sort of heritage product, but stripped, wherever local governments require it, of anything worthwhile it might stand for – is loathsome. The fact that the aesthetic of Britain’s ancient public schools is so attractive to brutal Middle Eastern regimes should tell us everything we need to know.",Opinion/Opinion,Expansionist private schools need a lesson in morality | David Mitchell,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/30/expansionist-private-schools-need-a-lesson-in-morality
1/30/2022,"A man who came to the UK to train as an accountant almost 40 years ago and was left homeless after a catalogue of Home Office delays has finally been granted leave to remain months before his seventieth birthday. Ponnampalam Jothibala, 69, a Sri Lankan Tamil, said he was overjoyed his case had finally been resolved, even though he was now “an old man”.  When interviewed by the Guardian last year, Jothibala said he had not been able to leave the UK for decades, but he dreamed of going on holiday by the seaside if his case was ever sorted. The Home Office finally granted him indefinite leave to remain earlier this month after leaving him on immigration bail for more than 16 years. “I need a holiday after all this,” Jothibala said. “Many, many years ago I visited Spain and Portugal and loved these places. I have decided I will go to Barcelona for my holiday.” He came to the UK in 1983 to go on a course at the London School of Accountancy, with hopes of forging a professional career. Education was highly valued in his family – both his parents were teachers and his close relatives are lawyers, doctors and accountants. Instead, he has spent decades homeless and staying on people’s sofas, sometimes sleeping on a mat at the London Sree Ayyappan Temple in Harrow, where he helped out as a volunteer cook before the pandemic struck. He was granted periods of temporary leave to remain by the Home Office in the 1980s but halted his studies after experiencing trauma as a victim of an arson attack in which three people died. He survived the fire by jumping out of a first-floor window. He was convicted of fraud and theft in 2003, and the Home Office planned to deport him, but he lodged an appeal and an immigration judge ruled in his favour in May 2006. The judge found Jothibala had been pressured and intimidated by criminals into committing the crime, from which he had derived no benefit himself. The Home Office mistakenly recorded on Jothibala’s file that he had lost rather than won his appeal, although officials took no steps to remove him from the UK, nor did they appeal against the judge’s ruling. A note on his Home Office file in July 2014 stated that Home Office officials, having spoken to the courts and tribunal service, now knew that the appeal had been upheld rather than dismissed. The note stated that “in light of the mishandling of the case following the determination of 2006”, the case would be reconsidered. However, no action was taken. Jothibala’s solicitor, Naga Kandiah, of MTC Solicitors, sent a letter to the Home Office last year informing officials that he would be lodging judicial review proceedings if they did not resolve the matter speedily. He said the Home Office had rejected an application he had made under the Windrush scheme , and called for an amnesty for Commonwealth citizens who arrived in the UK before 1988. Kandiah said: “This case is a sobering reminder of how a historic injustice can devastate a person’s life. My client has lost out on so many opportunities to progress in life. In 2006, his deportation order was overturned by the court but unfortunately nobody recognised that he was without formal status. After four decades in the UK I am so glad that the Home Office decided to exercise discretion and has granted him indefinite leave to remain.” Last year, the Home Office told the Guardian it would be defending its approach in this case after Kandiah launched a legal challenge. When approached again about the decision to grant Jothibala indefinite leave, a spokesperson said the Home Office did not comment on individual cases.",News/UK news,Sri Lankan man left in immigration limbo for decades can stay in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/30/sri-lankan-man-left-in-immigration-limbo-for-decades-can-stay-in-uk
1/30/2022,"The BBC has paid £1.64m in damages over the deaths of 11 former staff who died from cancer after working in corporation buildings riddled with asbestos, the Observer can reveal. It has made the payouts to families of make-up artists, engineers, riggers, set builders, studio managers and television producers. All 11 died of mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused by prolonged exposure to asbestos.  They worked at no fewer than 18 BBC locations, including Broadcasting House in central London, Pebble Mill studios in Birmingham and Television Centre in White City, west London, its headquarters for decades until 2013. The list also includes Bush House, the former base of BBC World Service radio, and Alexandra Palace, both in the capital. Known as “the birthplace of television”), the latter is a key part of BBC history because the corporation made its first TV broadcast from there in 1936. The BBC made the admissions in response to a freedom of information request by the Observer. We sought details of settled cases after revealing last year that it was facing potential damages claims from relatives of ex-members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra (BBCSO) and other former personnel who worked in premises containing asbestos. The broadcaster said it had paid £1,637,501 in compensation over the last decade to settle claims involving the nine men and two women, who worked for it between 1959 and 1998. It did not name them. “The payouts over these deaths show that asbestos remains a major menace,” said Liz Darlison, the chief executive of Mesothelioma UK, who is also a part-time NHS nurse in the NHS. “Many people don’t realise that 95% of our hospitals and 85% of our schools still contain some asbestos and that asbestos is a carcinogenic substance that causes mesothelioma. “It’s a dreadful disease. Over half of people die within a year of being diagnosed – an appalling statistic,” Darlison added. About 2,700 people a year in the UK are diagnosed with mesothelioma. Some of the 11 also worked at Dickenson Road Studios in Manchester and BBC Scotland’s former headquarters at Queen Margaret Drive in Glasgow’s West End as well as on Bressay, in the Shetland Islands, and on Ascension Island, at the World Service’s Atlantic Relay Station. The BBC said: “It is not possible to confirm whether the individuals were exposed to asbestos while working at BBC locations and, if so, over what period that exposure may have occurred.” In 2006 the BBC warned current and former employees and freelancers that they had been exposed to asbestos in studios TC2, TC3 and TC5 at the now-defunct Television Centre between 1990 and 2005. It was possible asbestos fibres had fallen from cable ducts on to floors, potentially giving rise to human exposure. The Observer reported last year how the family of Christopher Larkin, a horn player with the BBCSO who died of mesothelioma, were suing the BBC. The BBC admitted liability for the musician’s death and an inquest found he “died from the consequences of exposure to asbestos”. He rehearsed for 36 years at the BBC’s Maida Vale studios in London, which were later found to contain asbestos, some of it broken and exposed. The building is due to close and replacement studios are being built at the Olympic Park in east London. We also disclosed how the BBC had admitted exposing Richard Evans, a set builder on shows including Doctor Who who died of mesothelioma, to asbestos during his 23 years at the corporation making and painting sets. He worked mainly at Television Centre but also other locations around the UK and routinely used Artex, a textured coating that until the mid-1980s was made with white asbestos. His widow Valerie has also launched legal action. Harminder Bains, the lawyer for the families of Larkin, Evans and other former BBC staff who died of mesothelioma, said she suspected far more corporation personnel had been exposed to asbestos than those in the 11 settled lawsuits. “While the BBC may only have settled 11 cases, I don’t believe that they have only exposed 11 people to asbestos. “There must be hundreds if not a few thousand people [who were] exposed to asbestos by the BBC, given the number of locations but also the long number of years asbestos was present in BBC locations,” said Bains, a partner at Leigh Day Solicitors. The Commons work and pensions select committee is undertaking an inquiry into asbestos, chaired by the former Labour cabinet minister Stephen Timms. Its final evidence session this Wednesday will see MPs quiz bosses of the Health and Safety Executive as well as Chloe Smith, minister of state at the Department for Work and Pensions. Charles Pickles, an asbestos consultant turned campaigner, warned that many schools still contain amosite, also known as brown asbestos, and pose a danger to staff and pupils because it is the form of asbestos found in the lungs of 98% of people who develop mesothelioma. “Amosite is clearly lethal, yet remains built into our public buildings.” A BBC spokesperson said: “We would like to extend our continued sympathies to the families of all those affected. “The health and safety of BBC staff and all that use BBC buildings is a primary concern. The BBC manages asbestos in accordance with applicable regulations and statutory requirements.”",News/Media,Families win BBC payouts over 11 asbestos cancer deaths,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/30/families-win-bbc-payouts-over-11-asbestos-cancer-deaths
1/30/2022,"I’ve pinned the ultrasound images of the coming baby to the corkboard in our kitchen. It’s the first thing we’ve pinned there for a while. We got it shortly after we moved in, thinking it would be a place for us to keep lists, or vouchers or important notices. Once it got filled up, we just stopped using it because we are deeply unserious people masquerading as adults and, in fairness, when our son was born we surrendered to chaos a little more freely than before. Now it stands as a fossilised relic of the concerns and appointments we were faced with between April and September, 2018.  There are inscrutable notes, written with great haste about important things, now indecipherable. There is the EKG printout from that time I called 111 about my bad back and they managed to convince me I was having a heart attack and sent some rather unimpressed paramedics to our house. There is a gift voucher, itself three years out of date, for a Spanish restaurant that went out of business during the first lockdown. Looking at all these things now provokes the same melancholy tinge of those site photos from Pompeii; whole streets excavated to find people locked in an arbitrary moment in time, buried under volcanic ash, but still sitting upright at desks, or churning butter, or inspecting the use-by date on their tapas vouchers. Beneath that is the ultrasound we got for our son, four years ago. It has decayed over those years, blown out by exposure to the kitchen window, so that his tiny, spongy form, once clear, is now scribbled and scratched beyond all recognition. Its edges have curled up like a Cornetto wrapper, as if melted by creeping lava. Beside them, the ultrasounds of his sister, which are sharp and clean and brand new, seem like they are from a future age. It’s a stark, slightly bittersweet marker of how much time has passed. At a glance, it looks as if we ordered our first baby on VHS, but switched to Blu-ray for the next. And just to the left of that there is an even more striking artefact. A single sheet of notepaper marked GRAB LIST, which details everything we were supposed to bring to the hospital four years ago. On it I’ve written READY, as if this list is in its final, perfect form and proves our preparedness for everything that came after. It is a touchingly naive document of the moment just before our son was born, since its contents speak to a more innocent idea of what those few days in hospital would be like. I clearly presumed listening to music would be a big concern, as I’ve written speakers twice. This time we have no grab list, and the Bluetooth speakers will likely stay at home. We know that the volcano is coming, at least. We just no longer pretend to be ready. Did Ye Hear Mammy Died? by Séamas O’Reilly is out now (Little, Brown, £16.99).

1/30/2022,"The Responder (BBC One) | iPlayerTrigger Point (ITV) | ITV HubThe Gilded Age (Sky Atlantic)Survivors: Portraits of the Holocaust (BBC Two) | IPlayer I was rather taken aback by BBC One’s The Responder: by how good it is, how unsettling and vivid. It looks like a bog-standard “edgy” five-part police drama (all episodes are on iPlayer), this time set in Liverpool: the fraught “corrupt” cop with the marriage on the rocks; the seedy underworld; drug deals going wrong; threats; eruptions of violence … The Responder has all of this, but much more besides. It is television police drama refashioned as a long, dark night of the soul.  Martin Freeman plays the titular “responder” (officer who responds to 999 calls), who feels he’s “disappearing”. At first, hearing his Liverpudlian accent, you think: is this a Stephen Graham impersonation – how long before it turns into a tongue-chewing mess? But it doesn’t, and the effect is transformative – Freeman is a different actor almost – but that’s not all. He gives a first-rate performance: whether being pulled into the criminality, working nights dealing with society’s outcasts or offloading to his inevitable counsellor (practically TV law since The Sopranos), he’s believable all the way, exposing layer after layer of melancholy, humour, fortitude, weakness, existential dread and pain. Directed by Philip Barantini (Boiling Point), who also appears as an abusive boyfriend, and Tim Mielants (The Terror), The Responder is the first TV series written by author Tony Schumacher, who himself worked in Liverpool as a responder. This enriches the drama: there’s a realistic, often humorous bounce to the dialogue, a sense of “speaking human”. There are also fantastic performances: Ian Hart (sporting a truly terrible Harry Enfield-style “scousers” wig) is alternately menacing and mischievous as a drug dealer; Rita Tushingham is heartbreaking as a dying mother; Adelayo Adedayo burns through scenes as an initially judgmental rookie cop; Emily Fairn (well, hello, Juno Temple meets Andrea Riseborough) portrays a drug addict who – hallelujah! – isn’t just plonked there to be stereotypically doomed and pathetic. Negatives? The Responder is overlong and at times repetitive, the ending is mangled, and some of the night-time filming is so murky, it feels like being slowly lowered into a well. For all that, this is a defiantly anti-formulaic poem to redemption: original and unmissable. As for formulaic, there was the first episode of ITV’s new six-part bomb disposal series, Trigger Point. Created by Daniel Brierley, directed by Gilles Bannier, it’s from the same production stable as Line of Duty, and – slap me to my senses – I’d really been looking forward to it as a 21st-century answer to the late-70s toff-officers-and-bombs classic Danger UXB. It stars Vicky McClure as Lana, an explosives disposal (Expo) officer working alongside Joel, played by Adrian Lester, though (cue doomy spoiler hashtag!) #NotForLong. As soon as Joel starts fondly speaking of getting back with his ex, the clock is ticking on his chances of survival. He’s too lovely. Lana likes him so much. Also, Lester is a big name: sorry, mate, you’re toast. McClure and Lester are both excellent actors who could breathe naturalistic majesty into the instructions for a microwave meal. But even they struggled leading a soapy opener that was a tad heavy on jargon (trigger phones, jammers, “lucky” pairs of “snips”) and light on plot, characterisation and, for that matter, reality. Entering a council estate flat that is considered a “bomb factory”, would Lana, a seasoned professional, really have reached straight for the light switch? Spying an unattended van, would Joel, another expert, have nonchalantly strolled towards it? On the plus side, there was a visceral scene involving a suicide jacket, and an explosion was rendered as a beautifully macabre symphony of ash, fire and pebbles. I hope there’s more of this and less of the sense of an issue-box-ticking “school play”. Over to Sky Atlantic’s nine-part The Gilded Age to see Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes’s narrative logic (“I mean, everybody enjoys olden days posh people sneering at commoners, right?”) applied to late-19th-century New York. Left penniless by her father’s death, Marian (Louisa Jacobson) arrives in New York circa 1882 to live with her aunts: Christine Baranski in the Maggie Smith-patented ultra-snob role (“You belong to old New York”), and Cynthia Nixon, who does little more than simper lethargically and sew samplers. Elsewhere, a black (“coloured”) character (Denée Benton) yearns to be a writer, and an arriviste railway tycoon couple, the Russells (Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector), are viciously humiliated as they try to enter elite New York circles. The first episode is a clunker, though perhaps I was just imagining FOB (Fear of Bridgerton) ominously haunting every scene like an oversexed ratings-busting Netflix spectre. Peeking ahead, The Gilded Age, directed by Michael Engler, manages to be simultaneously too Downton (there’s an unsuitable lawyer love interest again) and not Downton enough: the usually magnificent Baranski is too limp to be the American Violet Crawley, and the servants are so underdrawn that, a few episodes in, I was wondering whether I should ring a little bell to find out who they were. Keep watching, though: the Russells, far from being victims, turn out to be new money brutalists who don’t take the snubs lying down. On BBC Two, the gently paced but fiercely moving documentary Survivors: Portraits of the Holocaust, directed by Suniti Somaiya, focused on the 2020 project, commissioned by the Prince of Wales, in which seven artists painted seven Holocaust survivors for an exhibition in the Queen’s Gallery, Buckingham Palace, ultimately destined for the Royal Collection. The artists, including Clara Drummond and Jenny Saville, were clearly moved to be involved, but it was the survivors, all children at the time, and their testimonies that compelled. Anita Lasker-Wallfisch went to Auschwitz fully expecting to be gassed – she survived by playing the cello in the women’s orchestra there – while Zigi Shipper initially thought the chimneys signified bakeries. Shipper and another sitter, Manfred Goldberg, knew each other from the camps, and took pleasure in their lifelong friendship. Together, they noted that even they, child survivors, were now dwindling in number. In keeping with the art project, this documentary came to be about bearing witness, remembrance, the solemn magnitude of it all.

1/30/2022,"When Germany’s new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, shook hands on a coalition deal with his liberal-green partners last month, they energetically vowed to “risk more progress”. Less than two months on, however, Berlin’s allies in Kyiv, Washington and neighbouring European capitals worry the country remains stuck in passive old ways. As tension mounts on the border between Russia and Ukraine, they fear Scholz is falling back on foreign policy instincts honed by his most recent centre-left predecessor, the ex-chancellor-turned-lobbyist Gerhard Schröder.  A restrictive attitude to exporting weapons is one source of frustration. In spite of being one of the world’s top five biggest exporters of arms, Germany says it cannot send lethal weapons into conflict zones for historic reasons, instead supplying Ukraine with 5,000 military helmets, a gesture that Kyiv’s mayor described as “a joke”. It has still not signed paperwork allowing Estonia to give Ukraine nine D-30 howitzers, which Germany has to authorise because the Soviet-made long-range weapons were once stationed in East Germany. For Germany’s critics, however, nothing symbolises its ambiguity towards the brewing conflict more than Nord Stream 2. The recently completed but still unapproved gas pipeline between Ust-Luga in Russia to Lubmin in north-east Germany, they say, shows how the country’s energy needs have made it vulnerable to blackmail by Putin. Scholz insists that “all options are on the table” when it comes to potential sanctions in the event of a Russian incursion into Ukraine, but his government has been slow to go into specifics, even arguing it is strategically wiser to remain vague. “We must not rule anything out when it comes to sanctions, including Swift [the global banking payments system] and Nord Stream 2,” said Nils Schmid, the foreign policy spokesperson of Scholz’s centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD). “If push comes to shove, then Nord Stream 2 will probably be unsustainable,” Schmid told the Observer. “It’s crucial that Putin cannot calculate in advance what the consequences of his actions will be.” The logic of this stance is not just questioned abroad but also domestically. “Threatening sanctions does not work if the other side can tell you are afraid to spell out what they are,” said Norbert Röttgen, a member of the Bundestag’s foreign policy committee for the conservative Christian Democratic Union. “It has to be clear that authorising Nord Stream 2 is out of the question if there is a war. “We are on the cusp of the most dramatic situation since the end of the second world war: a war in Europe that would change the geopolitical balance on our continent,” Röttgen told the Observer. “Chancellor Scholz needs to make it clear he understands the historic significance of this moment, or he risks gambling away Germany’s reputation as a reliable partner of the west.” As Scholz’s Social Democrats convene on Monday for an internal debate on its stance on Russia, Röttgen urged the party to take a stand against those who use German history as a cover “for personal financial gain and an appeasement policy that turns aggressors into victims”. The belief that Germany, whose military forays in the Nazi era cost millions of Russian lives, cannot act as aggressively towards the Kremlin as other European nations is not a minority view. It runs across the German party spectrum and is widely shared among the population. However, the SPD’s Schmid says: “You have to take into consideration that Germany, alongside France, has the role of a mediator between Russia and Ukraine in the Normandy format [the four-way contact group set up after the conflict in Donbas]. We cannot supply weapons to one of the two parties we are mediating between.” Even the Green party, heralded by some as human rights hawks who would radically reposition Germany’s stance on China and Russia after claiming the foreign ministry under the new government, reaffirms this position. “The German government has not provided any arms shipments to Ukraine for almost a decade,” said Agnieszka Brugger, a Green member of the parliament’s defence committee. “A change in policy would not make any significant short-term military difference on the ground but may be a big risk for the very difficult ongoing diplomatic talks,” Brugger said. “European and Nato unity in our support for Ukraine is crucial to demonstrate a strong stance towards Russia, and we should not let the different ways we show our support for our allies get in between us.” No party in the Bundestag has used Germany’s historic crimes as a cover for expanding ties with Russia as much as Scholz’s, however. As Germany’s oldest party, the SPD has a tendency to reach back into the history books, and few of the party’s politicians talk about Russia without citing Ostpolitik, the “change through rapprochement” foreign policy strategy towards the Soviet Union and its satellite states pursued by its former chancellor Willy Brandt. Yet the SPD’s attitude to Russia doesn’t necessarily run as deep as it likes to convince itself. In an essay for the Frankfurter Allgemeine last week, the historian Gerd Koenen argued that a foreign policy of “latent equidistance between Washington and Moscow” was rooted in the centre-left’s experience at the start of the millennium, when an SPD-led German government refused to join America’s war on terror. That stint in power resulted in the SPD splitting over domestic policy, with Chancellor Schröder pursuing a New Labourite third way while finance minister Oskar Lafontaine peeled off to co-found the leftwing Die Linke (The Left). But in their pro-Russian sympathies the two camp leaders remain united. Schröder, who on Friday insisted that Russia had no intention to invade Ukraine and accused Kyiv of “sabre rattling”, joined the state-controlled Russian giant Gazprom’s North European Gas Pipeline company, later renamed Nord Stream AG, as chairman within months of losing the 2005 election. The Baltic Sea pipeline between Russia and north-east Germany, which bypasses Baltic and east central Europe, was green-lit in the interim period before Angela Merkel took office, but continued under her tenure. At Nord Stream AG, Schröder’s chief executive is Matthias Warnig, a former high-ranking Stasi officer who once spied on West German industry for East Germany’s secret police under the aliases “Ökonom” (“Economist”) and “Arthur” and ascended to Putin’s inner circle after the fall of the Berlin Wall. While revelations about Stasi links can still curtail political careers in Germany – one Berlin state secretary from the same paramilitary regiment as Warnig was made to resign in 2017 – the past of Nord Stream’s boss is rarely mentioned in the debate around the project. “I am sometimes surprised this doesn’t play a more prominent role,” said an SPD politician who asked not to be named. Schröder’s networking still links the SPD and Russian gas. A German subsidiary of Nord Stream 2 called Gas for Europe, founded last week in an apparent attempt to complete the controversial pipeline’s certification process, has registered as its supervisory board chairman Dietrich Walter Haller, who worked at the chancellory under Schröder from 2003 to 2005. On Thursday night, the German foreign office announced it would seek to ban Haller from the role, since it was in conflict with his recent activity as a top diplomat. Lars Klingbeil, the Social Democrats’ co-chair, used to work in the Hanover constituency office of Schröder, whom he declined to desribe as a “lobbyist” when pressed in an interview with Der Spiegel last week. Klingbeil is also a trustee of “German-Russia – The new generation”, a networking association founded in 2011 by the Russian ambassador to Berlin. Scholz, who was SPD general secretary under Schröder, has brushed against these networks. But his rise to power is not of their making, and it remains possible that he can detach himself from them. If the Schröder generation’s approach to Russia was shaped by Brandt, Scholz has cited as his political idol Brandt’s successor, Helmut Schmidt, who prodded Nato in 1979 to adopt its so-called dual-track resolution: a strategy of military armament and threat coupled with an openness to dialogue. Schmidt’s confrontational course made him enemies within his own party, but in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung last week, Scholz seemed to signal that he favoured this strand of his party’s foreign policy tradition: “If you cite Brandt and Schmidt, then territorial integrity and states’ right to self-determination is an inextricable part of that,” he said. Schmid said: “Both Brandt and Schmidt were committed transatlanticists: that’s something that’s misremembered by some people in Germany, including some in my own party. Scholz will act in Schmidt’s vein: he has no nostalgic illusions when it comes to Russia. He won’t bat an eyelid when it comes to sanctions.”",News/World news,Ghosts of Germany’s past rise as Olaf Scholz seeks strategy for Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/30/olaf-scholz-germany-ukraine-strategy-ghosts
1/30/2022,"Monica Ali, 54, is the author of four novels but best known for her first, Brick Lane (2003), which catapulted her to fame even before it was published, earning her a place on Granta’s best young British novelists list. Love Marriage is her first book for 10 years and a publishing event in its own right: a serious, subtle, hugely entertaining exploration of relationships. At its centre is Yasmin, a doctor from a Bangladeshi family (Ali is of Bangladeshi and English heritage) and her fiance, Joe, a fellow doctor and son of a liberal, middle-class firebrand of a mother. She lives in London with her husband and their two grown-up children. Why has it taken so long to get this novel written?I went through a time of deciding I wasn’t going to write. I had a total loss of confidence. A healthy dose of self-doubt is good for any writer, but you also have to have self-belief. A total loss of confidence is catastrophic. I found I was depressed when I wasn’t writing and the depression fed into not being able to write – it was a downward spiral.  What got you out of it?I thought maybe I could write TV drama. I sank my teeth into learning to write scripts. Everybody said it was a tough thing to get into and that I’d feel beaten up by the process. I never found that, although, when the first thing I pitched was accepted by the BBC, I thought: “Easy!” [she laughs] and then… it never got made. Do you think Brick Lane’s success was too much too soon?Looking back, I was kidding myself. When asked about writing with a baby, a toddler and with little childcare, I’d merrily say: “It was fine, I wrote when they were napping.” I wish I’d been able to enjoy the publication process more. It took me away from home more than I wanted and I struggled with that. It had an impact I didn’t acknowledge because I thought I ought to be able to cope with everything, that it would be unbecoming to moan. When did you first realise you had a gift for storytelling?It’s funny because my children say I’m the worst storyteller ever. “Arrrgh… Mum’s starting a story again…” They’re not talking about my books, but if I’m telling a story at the dinner table, they immediately start rolling their eyes. I’d like to think it says nothing about me and a lot about the parent/child relationship. In Love Marriage, you send everyone up… is there absurdity in all of us and is it important to recognise that?It is how I see the world. Humour is a serious business because without comedy, the capacity for self-delusion is limitless. Comedy keeps us intellectually honest and enables us to embrace our human folly and strive with good-heartedness. It’s a prescription against falling into pessimism. If you were sending yourself up, what would you home in on?Ridiculous amounts of overanxiety, perfectionism and fears with which I torture myself… I laugh about it but I’m a great catastrophiser. I can see something happening to someone else, even across the world, and start imagining it happening to me. What is a love marriage and don’t all marriages end up to some extent arranged?Friends and acquaintances ask what the book is about. I say: love and marriage. But actually, it hinges on sex. Infidelity, revenge sex, sexual addiction… I must confess (without spoilers) I have a crush on middle-aged, single Dr Pepperdine.There’s a Pepperdine fan club at Virago, they’ve all got the hots for him! Harriet, Joe’s mother, is less irresistible: she believes herself tactful but is entitled and invasive – Jane Austen could not have done a better job characterising her. Do you know any Harriets?I have known Harriets and continue to meet them. Yasmin is pissed off when assumptions are made on the basis of her ethnicity. There can be a reflex attitude that [as a person of colour] you must, at all times, be a flag-bearer or an oracle and this can override complexity. Your characterisation of Joe’s therapist is spot-on. I gather your mother was a therapist?I’ve been in therapy for some years and been able to draw on that. I’ve done research, too, reading people like Gabor Maté. I’m deeply interested in the psychology of relationships, peeling back layers. If I were to change, a therapist is the career I’d be drawn to. What did your father do?He started as a civil engineer in Dhaka and worked in a factory when he came here and could not get any other job. He then went back to university and started teaching Open University courses. You grew up in Bolton and studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford?I had a fantastic time at Oxford – I felt like a fish out of water but quickly found a group of friends. So much of your novel is about parental influence. Is there any parental advice you still follow?The advice my father most frequently gives is: “Take it easy.” But I don’t take it easy. And besides, I don’t think he really means it. What is the most important thing to remember as the parent of grown-up children? Mine are 20 and 22. The main thing to remember is it only gets more complicated. What I can do now is to listen to them and not impose my view. You show deep understanding of loneliness in old age. Is this something you fear?I’ve had discussions with friends about how we’re going to start a commune together. The thought of doing things completely in isolation – even though, as a writer, I spend a lot of time on my own – is not good. Will we have to wait another 10 years for your next novel?I’m adapting Love Marriage for TV. This novel poured out of me – 240,000 words, which I cut down. But television is very story-hungry and there are scenes I can resurrect. For now, Yasmin and Joe continue – they are still a thing in my life.

1/30/2022,"It was news last week that women are having fewer children and at a later age: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that more than half of women in England and Wales don’t have children by the time they are 30. But it hardly felt surprising to me. As a woman without children, at 36, I don’t feel in a minority. Obviously, no one’s friendship circle is statistically significant, but my child-free friends still outnumber those with kids – whether by choice or circumstance. Yet while there seem to be similar reports published almost every week – here a piece on falling global births, there another on fertility rates dropping during the pandemic – the wider reaction is still often one of dismay and unfair judgment.  Only this month, the actual pope weighed in, criticising potential parents who prefer pets to children. And in response to these latest findings – that in 1971 18% of 30-year-olds had no children, while the figure now stands at 50.1% – some commentators were quick to assume that female fecklessness is the cause. Nick Robinson raised hackles by asking on Radio 4’s Today programme if women are delaying motherhood because “they want more fun before becoming a mum”. For a start, it’s frustrating that the ONS report only discusses women, as if having a baby is something we do by ourselves. Many women who don’t have or delay having kids do so because they haven’t met the right person or their right person isn’t keen. Without trotting out tired stereotypes about commitment-phobic men, the rise of dating apps has surely led to an increased sense – for men and women – of endless possibility, delaying our willingness to “settle down”. Which, if it means people don’t settle for rubbish relationships, has got to be good – even if it does contribute to delayed baby-making. But there’s also a mountain of economic reasons why millennials might think twice about having kids. The 2008 crash means we’ve only ever known job uncertainty; then there was a pandemic. Buying a home, something we’ve been told to do before sprogging, is harder than for previous generations (and, in parts of the country, almost impossible without financial help). Many people still aren’t earning enough to start a family until later. That old idea of the job for life, steady career progression and decent benefits is a dream for many. Yet with maternity pay feeble, and paternity more so, at least one parent needs to be earning well before kids can seem viable. To keep both jobs, you’ll need to spend an insane amount of money on childcare or have family nearby who can help out (also rare compared with previous generations). As I’ve seen from watching friends, it can seem impossible. And yet when someone really wants a baby, such rational considerations disappear. Having witnessed women in the grip of a desperate desire to conceive, the meanness of maternity payments may be an anxiety, but not having a baby feels worse. That deep, primal maternal urge triumphs. So I suspect there’s something more fundamental behind falling birth rates – and that’s choice, alongside the acceptance that, actually, not all of us do experience that maternal urge. This is borne out by the fact that birth rates are falling even in countries with generous parental leave and subsidised childcare, such as Sweden. Some women know they want kids, some know they don’t; many are ambivalent, a story we tend to hear less about. But it’s a very real experience and one I’ve spent the last few years thinking about: in my own life and while writing a novel exploring how changes in the 20th century affected choices and opportunities for women, in particular, I deliberately wanted to make my heroine share my hesitancy about having children. In previous generations, societal pressure would tend to steamroller such ambivalence: motherhood was an inevitable destiny for most women. But today, we genuinely have a choice. Women are educated, employed, financially independent and able to access contraception. When we’re not told we must have babies, fewer of us choose to. There’s surely a snowball effect here, too: the more women choose not to have kids, the more normal that seems and the more women see it as an option. Having so many happy, fulfilled, child-free friends has, I’m sure, contributed to the fact that having a baby never felt like the default for me. And when the genuinely undecided are faced with a real choice, that’s when all those other financial, practical and ethical concerns may help swing the decision. Still, it is a terrifying decision for the uncertain: you can change your mind about a job, a partner, a house. You can’t change your mind about a baby and the time frame for deciding is finite for women. And if the last several decades have shown us anything, it’s that you simply can’t “have it all”. You can’t have a baby and it not have an impact on the rest of your life – certainly not while financial support for parents is as it is. But it’s also the case that looking after a tiny human simply will – should! – change your priorities and lifestyle. Let’s be honest: there are enormous gains and losses on both sides. I feel a terrible sadness knowing that I may never feel that all-consuming love and joy parents talk about. But when I think about having a baby, I also feel a terrible terror of losing everything I love in my life. Maybe I would rather choose freedom, energy, time, sleep – yes, why not my own fun? For women who don’t feel that intense desire to mother, being liberated from expectation and pressure may be the thing that has tipped the scales against having kids. People questioning how much they really want to have children, rather than it being an unquestioned norm, is no bad thing. Being able to make that choice is a cause for celebration, not concern.
