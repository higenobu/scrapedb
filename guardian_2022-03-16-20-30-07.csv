3/16/2022,"A deal with Kyiv on “neutral status” for Ukraine as part of a peace agreement could be close, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said, as Kyiv announced a wave of counterattacks against Russian forces. Lavrov suggested in a media interview that talks with Kyiv were making ground despite the continued bloodshed, echoing cautiously optimistic comments overnight from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The negotiations are not easy for obvious reasons,” Lavrov told RBC news. “But nevertheless, there is some hope of reaching a compromise. “Neutral status is now being seriously discussed seriously along, of course, with security guarantees. This is what is now being discussed at the talks. There are absolutely specific wordings and in my view, the sides are close to agreeing on them”. In a video address in the early hours of Wednesday morning, Zelenskiy had said he believed there was possible room for compromise. “The meetings continue, and, I am informed, the positions during the negotiations already sound more realistic. But time is still needed for the decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said. “Efforts are still needed, patience is needed. Any war ends with an agreement.” On Tuesday, Zelenskiy had appeared to offer the Kremlin an olive branch by saying that Ukraine would not be joining Nato. Separately, Moscow’s lead negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, said his delegation in the talks with representatives from Kyiv was seeking for Ukraine to assume a status comparable to Sweden or Austria, two EU member states that are not members of the Nato military alliance. The proposal was also confirmed by the Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Wednesday morning. Medinsky told reporters on Wednesday that talks were “slow and difficult” but claimed that the Kremlin wanted peace “as soon as possible”. He added that other issues were being discussed, including the status of the Crimean peninsula, annexed illegally by Russia in 2014, as well as the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. The promising development was welcomed in Brussels, where Nato defence ministers were meeting in person for the first time since the war began on 24 February but suggestions of a peacekeeping force being deployed were rebuffed. During a visit to Kyiv by the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic on Tuesday, the Polish deputy premier, Jarosław Kaczyński, had suggested that such a deployment to Ukraine could provide humanitarian aid. The idea was rejected by defence ministers as they arrived for their meeting where they will hear from their Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, who is expected to plead for more weapons from individual Nato countries. “I’m afraid we’re still in too early stages to talk about that,” the Dutch defence minister, Kajsa Ollongren, said. “First we have to have a ceasefire. We have to see a withdrawal from Russia. There has to be some kind of agreement between Ukraine and Russia, and I think the talks are still going on.” She added: “It’s always good to think about what comes after that, but first, we need to achieve that.” The Estonian defence minister, Kalle Laanet, was more positive about the proposal, saying that the deployment of peacekeepers through the UN was “one of the possibilities and, of course, we have to look to all the possibilities which can help Ukraine”. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said he would need to “look at the details first before making any decisions about what happens”. A deployment would need the backing of the UN security council, where Russia holds a veto. Despite the positive mood music around the peace talks, Russian shelling continued remorselessly overnight. An update from Ukraine’s ministry of defence on Wednesday said the “worst situation remains in the area of Mariupol, where the opponent tries to block the city in the western and eastern outskirts”. Associated Press reported that Russian troops had seized a hospital in Mariupol and took about 500 people hostage during another assault on the southern port city late on Tuesday, according to the regional leader, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Two people were also confirmed dead overnight in Kharkiv after two residential buildings were destroyed. “As a result of an artillery attack on the multi-storey buildings in the Nemyshlyansky district of Kharkiv, several apartments in two residential buildings were destroyed,” Ukraine’s state emergency services said in an update on Wednesday morning. Rescuers worked to put out the blaze, rescuing four people from the collapse of a building but were unable to save two others who were killed in the attack, the agency added. A school also reportedly came under attack at about 3am, with part of a building destroyed. The Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych claimed that his country’s armed forces were conducting small-scale counterattacks on several fronts. “The situation … in the main hotspots has not changed, and has no chance of changing as Russia has used up its resources,” he said. Arestovych claimed Russia was continuing to fire missiles at Ukrainian targets, with approximately two-thirds of rockets hitting civilian buildings and infrastructure. The Ukrainian president is due to address US Congress later on Wednesday.",News/World news,"Russia and Ukraine ‘close to agreeing’ on neutral status, says Sergei Lavrov",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/russia-and-ukraine-close-to-agreeing-on-neutral-status-says-sergei-lavrov

The future of the Champions League holders is unsure after the government imposed sanctions on their owner, Roman Abramovich. United are aware that Tuchel is contracted until 2024 and has stated he will remain at Chelsea until the end of season. Yet the London club’s predicament has alerted the United hierarchy. Chelsea have been granted a special licence to operate until 31 May but if the club are not sold by then they face an uncertain future. Tuchel has impressed United with a CV that includes winning last season’s Champions League, after turning Chelsea around when replacing Frank Lampard last January. The 48-year-old also led Chelsea to the FA Cup final before claiming the Uefa Super Cup and the Fifa Club World Cup and losing this season’s Carabao Cup final. Paris Saint-Germain’s Mauricio Pochettino and Ajax’s Erik ten Hag are among other candidates under consideration. Their teams have, like United, gone out of the Champions League in the last 16.

3/16/2022,"My father, Sanjeev Datt Sharma, who has died aged 66 from long-term complications due to Covid-19, was a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist who specialised in IVF and worked in the NHS for nearly 40 years. Originally from India, he was born in New Delhi, the eldest of four children of Balkishen Datt, a civil servant, and Sushila (nee Sharma), a homemaker. After attending Central school in the town of Roorkee, he read medicine at the University of Delhi before becoming a doctor at various hospitals, including at Safdarjung hospital in Delhi. He married Deepali Das in 1984, and they emigrated to the UK shortly afterwards, settling in Liverpool. In the UK Sanjeev worked as a doctor in hospitals in Whitehaven, Cumbria, and Falkirk, Stirlingshire, before taking up a role as a senior registrar in Liverpool from 1986 onwards. In that post he served various hospitals that have become part of what is now the Liverpool Women’s NHS Foundation Trust, and in 1992 he became a consultant at Southport and Ormskirk hospital, where he stayed for the rest of his working life and was involved in conducting IVF procedures. He also did complex gynaecological surgery, including caesarean sections, and helped to bring thousands of babies into the world, of which a small but significant proportion were named after him. His other great professional interest was medical education, and he taught and examined students for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in London on a part-time basis for many years. Sanjeev was also a committed socialist and political activist. He campaigned for the local Labour party in Sefton, especially on the need for adequate funding for the NHS and against privatisation of health services. He spoke often about how comprehensive healthcare, free at the point of use, was the best thing about his adopted country and was proud to be part of it. Outside of work Sanjeev loved art, cinema and above all, cream tea scones. He took photos everywhere he went, and had threatened repeatedly to take up the saxophone, although luckily for the rest of us he never quite got round to it. He contracted Covid-19 in April 2020 as a result of his work with Covid-positive patients. While on a ventilator in intensive care he had a stroke, causing blindness and cognitive impairment. Later, on a visit to family in New Delhi, he was taken into hospital, where he died. A devout Hindu, his ashes were scattered in the Ganges, to be carried out to sea. He is survived by Deepali and me.",News/Society,Sanjeev Datt Sharma obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/16/sanjeev-datt-sharma-obituary
3/16/2022,"There’s a lot going on in this movie from first-time feature director Mariama Diallo – a pointed and intensely pessimistic horror-satire on racism and identity politics on the American campus. It could be that its material isn’t fully absorbed into the screenplay, but there is real claustrophobia and unease in each insidious microaggression. The setting is an imaginary Ivy League school in New England which now shrilly prides itself on its diversity, where Jasmine (Zoe Renee), a new student and young woman of colour, is unnerved to hear rumours that the room she has been assigned was where the university’s first black female student took her own life in the 1960s. Meanwhile, in a kind of generational-anxiety parallel, Gail Bishop (Regina Hall), a distinguished scholar with a respected publication record, is thrilled but nervous to have been appointed the first black woman “master” of one of the university’s constituent houses. (The word of course has queasy plantation echoes.) Someone these two women have in common is a rather trendy academic, Liv Beckman (Amber Gray) – Gail’s friend and Jasmine’s tutor – who teaches literature and theory. Liv is more overtly radical than Gail on issues of racism and is now up for tenure, which could be undermined by the fact that Jasmine has filed a formal complaint against her for giving her a failing F grade on her paper on The Scarlet Letter. These campus politics, arguably scary enough in themselves, are meshed with the escalating and uncanny happenings that Jasmine experiences, surrounded by sinister and boorish white undergraduates who are in the substantial majority, most disturbingly at a party on the dancefloor when all the excitable white students are raucously shouting out the N-words in Sheck Wes’s Mo Bamba. The movie shrewdly creates a shiver of nausea in the institutional use of “diversity” as another prestige-marker.

3/16/2022,"The new head of the policing inspectorate will be Andy Cooke, the former chief constable of Merseyside, the Guardian understands. Cooke is said to have impressed in interviews for the post of Her Majesty’s chief inspector of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) by pledging to get forces better focused on detecting more crime and locking up more criminals. It is a position that impressed the home secretary, Priti Patel, although delivering on it will be trickier than promising it, some police leaders believe. Cooke’s appointment marks a return to having a former chief constable leading the inspectorate. The outgoing chief inspector, Tom Winsor, was the first civilian to lead the policing standards body. He was a lawyer and former rail regulator whose appointment nine years ago was controversial. At that time the Conservatives were fighting the police over reforms and cuts. Now the government wants policing onside. Policing faces twin crises of confidence. The first is on public trust, with continued controversies around race and the protection of women, which particularly affects the Metropolitan police, Britain’s biggest force. The second is to do with falling rates of catching criminals and coping with burgeoning demand, which affects forces such as Greater Manchester, the third biggest in England. Cooke saw off competition from, among others, Shaun Sawyer, the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall police, and Sir David Thompson, the West Midlands chief constable. HMICFRS’s role is to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of police and fire services in England and Wales and to suggest improvements. It is supposed to be independent of the government and police. Cooke will have a confirmation hearing next Wednesday before MPs on the home affairs committee. The three biggest jobs in policing have recently been up for grabs. An announcement is imminent for the director general of the National Crime Agency, with Bernard Hogan-Howe among the final candidates. He, like Cooke, is a former chief constable of Merseyside, and he then went on to be the commissioner of the Met. Also on the shortlist for the NCA job is the former counter-terrorism chief Neil Basu, whose selection would be a landmark as he would be the first ethnic minority Briton to hold one of the biggest jobs in the criminal justice system. The other final candidates are Graham Biggar, the interim head of the NCA, Paul Lincoln, a former senior civil servant who was head of Border Force, and Dominic Wilson, the head of security policy at the Ministry of Defence. The Met commissioner’s job is also soon to be advertised, with Cressida Dick still locked in wrangling with the London mayor over the date and terms of her departure after her resignation a month ago. Government sources say the wrangling is delaying formally starting the process of finding the next commissioner. One possible candidate who is considering applying is Dame Lynne Owens, the former head of the NCA, who stepped down last year because of her health. She is thought to have made a better than expected recovery. In a Guardian interview last year, Cooke identified poverty as a key driver of crime. “The best crime prevention is increased opportunity and reduced poverty. That’s the best way to reduce crime. So there needs to be substantial funding into the infrastructure of our inner cities and our more deprived areas,’” he said. “Why do people get involved in crime and serious crime? It’s because the opportunities to make money elsewhere aren’t there for them. We need to reduce that deprivation and the scale of deprivation that we see in some of our communities, because if you give people a viable alternative, not all but a lot will take it.”",News/UK news,Ex-Merseyside police chief to be new head of policing inspectorate,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/16/ex-merseyside-police-chief-andy-cooke-new-head-policing-inspectorate-hmicfrs
3/16/2022,"The improbable story of Neil Baldwin gets more improbable still. Who else among us could expect to spend their 76th birthday watching their life played out at the local theatre? Yet here Baldwin is at the New Vic, graciously waving from the top row as the actors take their bows. And that’s actors in the plural – it takes seven of them to stage this extraordinary tale, all taking on the role of a man who, through some combination of charm and positive thinking, has befriended everyone from circus legend Charlie Cairoli to the Archbishop of Canterbury. “As always with Neil, his exact status was unclear,” says one of the many Baldwins as they try to make sense of his story. Indeed, the staging hovers on the edge of the surreal. There is something dreamlike about the way Baldwin becomes a one-man welcome party for Keele University freshers, among them Malcolm Clarke who co-wrote the book on which the show is based. That he eventually received an honorary degree is no less likely than his spell as a circus clown or his employment as a mascot for Stoke City football club. In her knowing adaptation – co-written, naturally, with Baldwin himself – director Theresa Heskins extends the line of improbability to include the 2014 release of the Bafta-winning Marvellous with Toby Jones and, indeed, the making of this stage production. Among the many Baldwins in this freewheeling show, Michael Hugo plays the “real Neil”, shaping the story and commenting on the performances as he goes. On an open set by Lis Evans, given definition by Daniella Beattie’s clever lighting, the in-the-round staging is about community and possibility. Community, because it’s a quintessentially local story (the man sitting next to me recalls Baldwin judging a cake competition) and possibility, because everything is up for grabs – including actor Gareth Cassidy’s many accents. Perhaps the production is a little too fond of its own theatricality, but its tone of playfulness is infectious. Amid the fun and games, you almost don’t notice the questions it raises about our treatment of people with learning disabilities. His is a story of struggle as well as improbable achievement.

3/16/2022,"Marina Ovsyannikova, a Russian state television Channel One employee, was detained yesterday after interrupting a live news broadcast on Monday with an anti-war message. She appeared in court later, where she was fined 30,000 roubles (£215) for breaking protest laws and could still face other charges. But in a way she has already won a great battle against propaganda in Russia. With her action, a long silence has been broken. I have heard that at least two important correspondents, one from Channel One and one from NTV – Zhanna Agalakova and Vadim Glusker – have handed in their notice. A source I know at VGTRK, the state media holding company, has said that many others at the main news programme were considering resigning, and the mood among remaining employees was nasty. They said: “If we didn’t have our mortgages, we would quit too.” Another friend who worked at one of the state TV channels told me that “a red line has been crossed”. The story is enormous on social media. This is a new feeling for people who work in these strict, pro-government places. I believe it was a revolutionary development for TV in Russia – akin to the first live images of war from the Persian gulf in 1991. Ovsyannikova’s performance will probably go down in the history books, like Pussy Riot’s radical action in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow in 2012. The programme she protested on, Vremya, is a legacy of the former USSR. It is perhaps the most prestigious news show on Russian TV. For millions, it is part of a daily habit for years, even decades, to watch the big evening news at 9pm. Fitting for its Soviet beginnings, it has been an ideological weapon for decades, shoring up the government with strict pro-regime coverage. It is not subtle. The hosts look like robots, or Soviet or North Korean broadcasters. Just watch when Ovsyannikova makes her shocking move. The host Ekaterina Andreeva doesn’t even bat an eyelid. It doesn’t compute. I’m not sure she even sees herself as a propagandist, just a person with a social mission. This didn’t fit into it, and she – along with all the others – had no response. There has been a lot of talk that that this could have been a staged performance. Managed dissent, or somehow allowed. In my opinion this is a ridiculous assumption, itself rooted in Kremlin propaganda – in this case the idea that anything out of the ordinary that happens they must control. It will only benefit them for us to think this is a setup and that they control everything. It is important for them that we not believe that one woman can go against a huge machine, that she can break away from the system and defy it. But she did. Just three seconds on air can inspire people and give them strength. The consequences will be very unpleasant for the Kremlin people who control the media in Russia. Many of them are saying nothing happened, as if Ovsyannikova never existed. In his new novel, Doctor Garin, the great Russian writer Vladimir Sorokin portrays Putin as a character who constantly says “it’s not me”, denying everything. That lie is the central pillar of the regime. Nothing bad is their fault. And nothing like this – contradicting them – is supposed to happen. Especially on these channels they’re supposed to control. But of course they lie about everything. About the war, about the civilian casualties that resulted from the bombings in Ukraine, about their own losses. Many Russians believed in these lies, and because they believed in them it made them true as far as the government was concerned. State TV was a huge part of that. But the situation has started changing, the system cracked and crashed for a moment, and we say it could be disenchanted and even destroyed. Thanks to Marina Ovsyannikova.

3/16/2022,"Scientists are calling for the immediate rollout of Covid vaccines to primary-aged children, as new data suggests that even a single dose of the Pfizer jab helps to prevent older children against infection, and shortens the duration and severity of symptoms if they do get infected. According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, 2- to 11-year-olds have the highest rate of infections of any UK age group, with 4.2% testing positive during the week ending 5 March. Secondary-aged children (up to Year 11) have the lowest rate of infections, with 2.4% testing positive. The UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) approved the vaccination of healthy 5- to 11-year-olds on 16 February. At the time, Sajid Javid said the NHS would prepare to extend this “non-urgent” vaccination offer to all children during April “to increase protection against potential future waves of Covid-19” – but parents are still unable to book an appointment, and it is unclear how vaccines will be delivered to this age group. Some scientists fear that a new wave is now fast approaching – and with barely any primary-aged children vaccinated, and only around a quarter of 12- to 15-year-olds having received a second dose. “I just don’t understand what the lack of urgency and the complacency is,” said Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds. “The BA.2 variant is surging across Europe, and kids are still going to be at school through to the summer.” He added that while the risk of Covid to children is small, “it is magnified greatly when the virus is so prevalent”. Recent data published by the US Centres for Disease Control suggested that unvaccinated 5- to 11-year-olds were three times more likely to be admitted to hospital during January, compared to those who had received two vaccine doses. Russell Viner, a professor of child and adolescent health at University College London, said while there were pragmatic and technical challenges associated with the mass vaccination of younger children, these issues should have been overcome by now. “I do believe there’s an argument to get on with this,” he said. “The medical arguments are marginal for children, but once the decision has been made that the vaccine is safe, has some effectiveness, and on balance, parents should be able to opt in for their children if they so wish, there’s an equity argument to say that the system now needs to deliver that for children. “Children have been at the back of the queue for benefits right across this pandemic. If they are entitled to a vaccination, they should have access to it if they want it.” Irene Petersen, a professor of epidemiology and health informatics at University College London, said if the vaccines are going to have any impact it is important that they are given before an outbreak. Vaccinating younger children now, might also enable them to receive a second dose before the Autumn. According to JCVI guidance, 5- to 11-year-olds shouldn’t be offered a second dose until at least 12 weeks after their first jab. Their warnings came as new data suggested a single dose of the Pfizer vaccine almost eliminated the risk of reinfection for at least 100 days for 12- to 17-year-olds who had recovered from Covid. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, analysed data from 115,775 British adolescents, whose parents reported their symptoms and vaccination status via the Zoe Covid symptom study app. It also suggested that a single vaccine dose reduced the risk of infection with Omicron by 53.7% at 14–30 days, rising to 57.9% at 31–60 days, and by 63.7% after 61–90 days. Among 12- to 15-year-olds who did become infected with Omicron, the following symptoms were less common among those who’d received a single vaccine dose: loss of smell, fever, low appetite, abdominal pains, and muscle pain. Senior author Prof Emma Duncan from King’s College London said the findings highlighted the benefits of being vaccinated – both in terms of protection from illness, and avoiding further disruption to children’s education. “Our data suggest that even a single dose decreases the chance of getting infected, and that benefit is seen even more in those people who have had a previous infection,” she said.

3/16/2022,"For all the damnation and disappointment sparked by the inevitability of the result, there was something fitting about last week’s first Test between Pakistan and Australia ending in a draw. This, after all, is the spiritual home of stalemate: though only 32% of the 2,345 Tests in history have been drawn, in the first half-century of Test cricket in Pakistan 51% of all matches ended without a winner (65 of 128). Between October 1961 and March 1984 England played out 11 successive draws there, including three of the five all-drawn series Pakistan hosted in that time. Fully 69% of all Tests played in Pakistan in the 1960s were drawn, followed by 71% in the 1970s and 56% in the 1980s. Returning to the country for the first time in 24 years Australia picked up where they had left off, with a seventh draw in their last nine matches there going back to 1988. Steve Smith bemoaned a “benign, dead wicket”; Wasim Akram thought the pitch guaranteed cricket that “is quite boring, to be honest” and that “as an ex-fast bowler I knew this would be a draw after the second delivery”. “A drawn match is never a good advertisement for Test cricket,” said Ramiz Raja, the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board. Meanwhile in Antigua, the first Test between West Indies and England headed along a different path towards the same destination. The former Observer cricket correspondent RC Robertson-Glasgow – who for much of his life laboured under the nickname Crusoe after someone confused his name with that of Daniel Defoe’s castaway – once complained that “drawn matches are the threat and ruin of modern Tests: boring to anticipate, irritating in process, and unsatisfactory in retrospect”, and 84 years and several redefinitions of the word modern later many would still agree. In October 1956, looking back on a season marked by a decline in attendances at English first-class games, the Guardian’s Denys Rowbotham struck a contrasting tone. “To set the wrong right there have been the usual monotonously unvaried panaceas, changes in the laws and in equipment, in the manner of awarding penalties and rewards, and inevitably plans for reorganising the first-class programme,” he wrote. “The falling attendances are believed to be due to dull, tedious cricket. This may be so, it may not be so. Let it be assumed, however, that first-class cricket is boring the public. At once it becomes relevant to ask: was and is first-class cricket primarily intended as a form of entertainment for the general public?” The only possible answer to this question is negative. A Test is essentially an exercise in which one group of cricketers attempts ideally to beat, and failing that to avoid defeat by, another group of cricketers within the laws of the game, and which others may watch if they insist on doing so. For most of the game’s history so many people have chosen to watch that stands have had to be built to accommodate them, tickets have been issued, television cameras installed, commentators employed. But if the entertainment of any of those people were actually important, by now surely something would have been done to make it more likely. There are plenty of sports, and even other versions of cricket, which, like the theatre or a circus, are nothing if nobody is there to watch. Some sports – and this really is a very puzzling concept – last barely three hours from start to finish yet during even brief breaks in play troupes of dancers emerge to wave shimmering tinsel balls to a deafening soundtrack, lest any spectator think for an instant that they are not being constantly entertained. How boring must a spectacle be to require such adornment? And how its organisers must envy a sport that can last for five full days, not even guarantee a result, and offer spectators no entertainment during its regular extended breaks beyond lengthy bar queues. Such confidence! And yet, as a century of public hand-wringing attests, such insecurity! Tests are surely about moments, spells and sessions as much as they are about results, with thrilling climaxes rendered even more precious by how unlikely the format makes them. Is anything about drawn Tests more irritating than how irritated everyone gets by them? It is perfectly understandable to desire results and entertainment, and there are pastimes that guarantee those, but this is not one of them. If draws have been irritating and unsatisfactory for as long as they have without anyone legislating against them, then they’re obviously not irritating or unsatisfactory at all. In the final Ashes Test of 1963 at the SCG, Australia, set a target of 241 by England’s last-day declaration, laboured to 152 for four at the close of play having scored 2.11 runs per eight-ball over. A draw had long seemed inevitable, and only 14,000 people turned up to watch it be confirmed. “At the last, as the sun cast long shadows on the grass, no people congregated round the pavilion, and there were no calls for either side’s players or captain,” Rowbotham reported. “Enthusiasm had given way to disillusionment.” Ted Dexter, the England captain, admitted that “if there had been a thousand pounds per man for winning this game there would have been a result”. In the stands a certain John Baldry, an estate agent from Sydney’s Bellevue Hill, was miffed. He had taken time off work and spent £3 (Australia adopted dollars three years later) on attending, and had expected better. So he sued. “He is entitled to certain standards and certain competency,” said his lawyer when the case came to trial. “Above all, he is entitled to an effort by both sides to win the game. If he does not get this quality he is entitled to his money back.” On reflection, the judge decided he was not.  This is an extract from the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.
