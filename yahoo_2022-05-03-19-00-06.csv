5/3/2022,"After nearly 50 years of settled law, the Supreme Court appears primed to strike down the historic 1973 decision of Roe v. Wade. During her MSNBC show on Monday, a shocked Rachel Maddow shared her initial thoughts and concerns about the decision being overturned. “It is shocking both in substance and it is also shocking in terms of what it means about the court, we and what it means about the stakes here that someone is willing to do this,” Maddow said. Roe v. Wade guaranteed constitutional protections of abortion rights. However, an initial draft majority opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito and reported by Politico cites the decision was overturned. As was the subsequent 1992 decision of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed a woman’s right to choose. “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” Alito wrote. “It is time to heed the Constitution and return the issue of abortion to the people’s elected representatives.” With a reported 21 states planning to ban abortion if the landmark case is in fact overturned, women across the country may find they have lost the right choose how or when they are pregnant. “This draft opinion saying that the Supreme Court is about to clear the way just for that, means that we're on the precipice of becoming a very different country,” Maddow said. “And our daughters and granddaughters are living in a very different world.” As for what exactly that different world might be, Maddow’s guest, Maryland congressman and House judiciary committee member Jamie Raskin, believes it might very well look like something from a popular Hulu series. “This would appear to be an invitation to have Handmaid’s Tale-type anti-feminist regulation and legislation all over the country,” he said.

5/3/2022,"By Steve Holland, Trevor Hunnicutt and David Brunnstrom WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two months after warning that Beijing appeared poised to help Russia in its fight against Ukraine, senior U.S. officials say they have not detected overt Chinese military and economic support, a welcome development in the tense U.S.-China relationship. U.S. officials told Reuters in recent days they remain wary about China's long-standing support for Russia in general, but that the military and economic support that they worried about has not come to pass, at least for now. The relief comes at a pivotal time. President Joe Biden is preparing for a trip to Asia later this month dominated by how to deal with the rise of China and his administration is soon to release his first national security strategy about the emergence of China as a great power. As well as steering clear of directly backing Russia's war effort, China has avoided entering new contracts between its state oil refiners and Russia, despite steep discounts. In March its state-run Sinopec Group suspended talks about a major petrochemical investment and a gas marketing venture in Russia. Last month, the U.S. envoy to the United Nations hailed China's abstentions on U.N. votes to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a ""win,"" underscoring how Beijing's enforced balancing act between Russia and the West may be the best outcome for Washington. Still, China has refused to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine and has criticized the sweeping Western sanctions on Moscow, while saying it is not deliberately helping circumvent them. Trade volume between Russia and China also jumped in the first quarter, and the two declared a ""no limits"" partnership in February. On Monday, Beijing's Washington embassy issued a 30-page newsletter accusing the United States of spreading ""falsehoods"" to discredit China over Ukraine, including through a March press leak saying Russia had sought Chinese military help. The embassy noted that U.S. officials had since said they had seen no evidence of China providing such support. Biden himself has not spoken of China helping Russia since telling reporters in Brussels March 24 that in a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, he ""made sure he understood the consequences."" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week China is dealing with the ""significant reputational risk"" of being Russia's ally and that ""for now we're not seeing significant support from China for Russia's military actions."" Biden is to visit Tokyo and Seoul in what will be his first trip to Asia as president - one that won't include a stop in China. He'll meet with Indian and Australian leaders too, during a 'Quad' meeting in Tokyo. China has made Russia a key part of its foreign policy strategy to counter the West. Biden aides were worried Xi was planning to provide direct support to Russian President Vladimir Putin as his campaign in Ukraine faced fierce setbacks, one U.S. official said. They were heartened this has not happened so far, but Washington and its allies are continuing to closely monitor the level of assistance, the official said. Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, said stark warnings by the U.S. and European Union have paid off so far. ""There has been consistent messaging that if China does so it will face severe consequences. It appears that so far, the Chinese have not. It is feasible that the Chinese planned to provide military assistance and changed their minds,"" she said. However U.S. officials remain concerned about China's refusal to condemn Russia's actions in Ukraine and what they say is its continued parroting of Russian disinformation over its intervention there. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on April 21 that Beijing had ""repeatedly drawn false equivalencies between Russia's war of aggression and Ukraine's self-defensive actions."" She added: ""Let's be clear, China's already doing things that do not help this situation.""

5/3/2022,"Human remains found in Texas late last year have been positively identified as belonging to the missing girlfriend of former San Francisco 49ers tight end Kevin Ware Jr. The remains, which were discovered outside Houston in December, were positively identified as Taylor Pomaski’s over the weekend, a spokesperson for the Harris County Sheriff’s Office said. The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences made the official determination on Saturday. An official cause or manner of death hasn’t been released. Toxicology results are now pending, officials said. No arrests have been made in Pomaski’s suspicious death. ""The investigation is still open and active and homicide investigators are diligent on bringing this case to a close,"" Harris County Sheriff’s Senior Deputy Thomas Gilliand said in a statement sent to Oxygen.com on Monday. Pomaski, who was Ware’s girlfriend, mysteriously vanished from a house party in Spring, Texas on April 25, 2021. From the case’s early stages, investigators have suspected foul play in the 29-year-old Texas woman’s disappearance. Ware was arrested by the U.S. Marshals on June 11, 2021 for allegedly violating post-release conditions related to a prior felony conviction. Although Ware hasn’t officially been named a suspect in Pomaski's disappearance and death, prosecutors said he was “suspected of murdering” his girlfriend during court hearings in a separate case last year, according to KTRK-TV. Photo: Harris County Sheriff's Office At the time of Ware's arrest, Pomaski’s friends and family told news outlets that they were convinced she’d been forcibly abducted, noting allegations of past domestic abuse between the couple. “She was in trouble,” Eric Zulegar, Pomaski’s ex-boyfriend, told KPRC-TV in June 2021. “There was violence, she referenced a gun being pulled on her. She was very scared, very nervous.” But Ware’s defense team has vehemently denied that the 41-year-old former tight end was even a suspect in his girlfriend’s disappearance or death. ""The law enforcement agency handling the Pomaski investigation has not named Kevin as a suspect,"" Coby DuBose told Oxygen.com last year. ""In reality, the only court document naming him as a suspect is a filing by the District Attorney’s Office in another county that is trying to convince a judge to hold him without bond.""  His lawyer was also adamant Ware was cooperating with detectives investigating Pomaski’s disappearance. ""Kevin met with investigators who are investigating Ms. Pomaski’s disappearance and told them everything he knew,"" he added. ""He also let them into his home. And took them room to room."" DuBose and Bryan Garris, another attorney representing Ware, didn’t immediately respond to Oxygen.com’s requests for comment on Monday.  Ware played in 16 career NFL games between 2003 and 2004 for the San Francisco 49ers and the Washington, D.C. team now known as the Commanders. Ware is being held without bond at a Montgomery County detention facility, according to online jail records obtained by Oxgyen.com. He has past arrests for assault, evading police, theft, criminal mischief, burglary and felon possession of a firearm, online records show. No further details regarding the open case were released by law enforcement this week. Anyone with additional information is urged to contact the Harris County Sheriff’s Office at 713-274-9100 or Crime Stoppers of Houston at 713-222-8477.",U.S./Oxygen,"Remains Of Ex-NFL Player’s Girlfriend, Who Was Missing For Year, Positively Identified",https://news.yahoo.com/remains-ex-nfl-player-girlfriend-195249376.html
