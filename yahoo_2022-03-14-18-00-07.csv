3/14/2022,"By Kirsty Needham SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia and the Netherlands said they had begun joint legal action against Russia at the International Civil Aviation Organisation over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 eight years ago. Russia was responsible under international law for the downing of the flight, and action in the United Nations aviation council was a step forward in the fight for justice for 298 victims, including 38 Australians, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement on Monday. Australia said the incident was a clear breach of a convention to protect civilian aircraft from weapons fire. The Dutch government said in a statement the UN Security Council had also been informed of the step. Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said in the statement: ""The death of 298 civilians, including 196 Dutch, cannot and should not remain without consequences. The current events in Ukraine underscore the vital importance of this."" The joint action under Article 84 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation is separate to a Dutch murder trial for four suspects over their individual criminal responsibility. Australia said it was seeking full reparations from Russia for the injury caused, and the suspension of Russia's voting power in the aviation council, which sets standards for civilian air travel. While it has no regulatory power, the Montreal-based ICAO sits at the centre of a system of safety and security standards that operates across political barriers but requires an often slow-moving consensus. ""Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and the escalation of its aggression underscores the need to continue our enduring efforts to hold Russia to account for its blatant violation of international law and the UN Charter, including threats to Ukraine’s sovereignty and airspace,"" Morrison and Payne said in the statement. MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014 when it was hit over rebel-held eastern Ukraine by what international investigators and prosecutors say was a Russian-made surface-to-air missile. Moscow has always denied involvement and has promoted a range of alternative theories, which international investigators have rejected as unsupported by evidence. A verdict in the murder trial, involving three Russians and a Ukrainian who remain at large, is expected later this year. None of the defendants have attended the Dutch court. Australia and the Netherlands would rely on evidence MH17 was shot down by a Russian surface-to-air missile system transported from Russia to an area of eastern Ukraine under the control of Russian-backed separatists, and it was accompanied by a Russian military crew, the statement said. The missile system was returned to Russia shortly after the downing of MH17, it said. ""Russia has to date refused to take responsibility for its clear role in this incident,"" Payne told reporters in Sydney on Monday. Australia and the Netherlands had pursued negotiations with Russia in good faith over the incident, but Russia unilaterally withdrew from the talks in 2020, she said.

3/14/2022,"In the last two weeks, 220,000 Ukrainians have made the trek home, the country's border guard said — many were traveling when the Russian invasion began, others needed to tie up loose ends at their foreign jobs, some are returning to fight, and a few say it's even harder to be a refugee than it is to be back in Ukraine. On their journey last week from the Ukrainian town of Mykolaiv to Poznan, Poland, Zhanna Sinitsyna, her 30-year-old daughter Nadiia, and 12-year-old granddaughter Kira witnessed explosions and heard gunfire. Once in Poznan, the plan was to find work and send money to Mykolaiv, where Zhanna's husband and 19-year-old son are part of efforts to defend the city. They were unable to find an affordable place to stay in Poznan near areas with employment opportunities and quickly discovered they didn't have enough money to purchase necessities. After just two days, Zhanna convinced Nadiia and Kira to return to Mykolaiv on Saturday, despite their concerns. ""In my soul, Mykolaiv is my home,"" Zhanna told The Washington Post. ""And I need to be home."" Oleksii Zvieriev is from the Kyiv suburb Brovary, and works as a truck driver, delivering goods across Europe. On the day Russia invaded, he decided that as soon as the job was over, he would go back to Ukraine and start fighting. Standing at a train station in Przemysl, Poland, on Saturday night, he told the Post he was keeping his word and heading home. ""It's hard to talk about the emotions of going back into a war,"" Zvieriev said. ""I have friends sitting in basements telling me they're hearing explosions all the time. I can't stop worrying."" Two of his friends — one 40 years old, the other 25 — were killed shortly after picking up arms against Russia. Read more at The Washington Post.

3/14/2022,"Sen. Mitt Romney said former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard's ""treasonous lies may well cost lives."" His remarks followed comments from Gabbard about US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. Russia last week baselessly accused the US of funding the development of bioweapons in Ukraine. Republican Sen. Mitt Romney strongly condemned former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, seemingly responding to comments she has made in recent days about US biological laboratories in Ukraine. ""Tulsi Gabbard is parroting false Russian propaganda. Her treasonous lies may well cost lives,"" Romney said in a tweet on Sunday afternoon. A representative for Romney did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment on what specifically he was referring to. Earlier in the day, Gabbard, who ran for president in 2020, posted a video on Twitter repeating claims about US-funded biolabs in Ukraine. She also appeared on Fox News host Tucker Carlson's show last week and said she was ""deeply concerned"" about claims of bioweapons in Ukraine. Russia has spread a baseless claim that the US is funding the development of bioweapons in labs in Ukraine. Russian and Chinese state media amplified the claims, while the US warned they could indicate that Russia is planning to use chemical weapons in its invasion of Ukraine. In a fact check of Russia's biolabs claims, The New York Times reported that there are biological labs in Ukraine that are backed by the US in an effort to prevent bioweapons from being made or used. The Washington Post reported the labs study African swine fever, which infects pigs rather than humans, with the goal of preventing it from spreading. The Post also reported funding for the Ukraine labs was initially authorized by the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency. Representatives for Gabbard did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Meanwhile, Russian TV played clips of Carlson and Gabbard, The Daily Beast's Julia Davis reported. Mother Jones reported the Kremlin sent a memo instructing state media to feature Carlson ""as much as possible"" because he ""sharply criticizes"" the US and NATO. Rep. Adam Kinzinger also lashed out at Gabbard in a tweet in response to her comments: ""Actual Russian propaganda. Traitorous. Russia also said the Luger center in Georgia was making zombies. Tulsi should go to Russia."" Representatives for Romney and Kinzinger did not respond to requests for comment. Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/INSIDER,Sen.
