2/1/2022,"Peter van Onselen, the political editor of Network Ten, undermined and humiliated the network’s federal political reporter, Tegan George, including by backgrounding other journalists against her, according to a statement of claim filed against the network in the federal court. George says she has been unable to work since June last year and claims she suffered “hurt, humiliation and distress” and the loss of opportunity to advance her career at the network, in part due to her treatment by Van Onselen.  She claims the network did nothing about her treatment, and that she was threatened with disciplinary action when she resisted making a formal statement about an alleged sexist remark that she had overheard. After George complained to news bosses about the lack of a “clear chain of command” and “conflicting instructions” under Van Onselen’s management of the Canberra bureau, she was allegedly told by the network’s executive editor, Anthony Murdoch, “Peter is batshit crazy but we just have to get used to it” and that Van Onselen expected George to apologise for “hurting his feelings” by raising the issue. George also complained about the behaviour of other managers at the network, claiming one was “rude and hostile” to her. George’s statement of claim, seen by Guardian Australia, says Ten managers told her the Canberra bureau had always been “toxic” and she needed to learn to “deal with it”. The claim says Van Onselen rejected George’s complaint of being “unsupported, disrespected and unwelcome” and news management said the political editor “did not give a shit” about how she was feeling. When Canberra staff complained about having to write Van Onselen’s TV news packages as well as their own, news boss Ross Dagan said “words to the effect that Mr van Onselen was the Network’s number one and said that they were all expected to build Mr van Onselen’s brand”, according to the statement of claim. George claims that when she and a female colleague raised concerns about their workload with management they were asked by a manager (not Van Onselen): “What did you even do today? Painting your nails and drinking herbal tea?” The federal political reporter claims the Ten Network, where she has worked for 11 years, breached her general protections under fair work laws by reducing her standing and reputation among her colleagues, subjecting her to speculation and gossip, causing her public embarrassment which made her feel isolated and unsupported – in effect failing to provide a safe workplace. George also claims she was pressured into making a formal statement after she “overheard a conversation in Network Ten’s Parliament House bureau between a Network Ten employee and a freelance camera operator in which a sexist remark was made about another employee”. After initially resisting making a statement about the alleged remark in May 2021, she was threatened with disciplinary action and eventually relented, the statement says. George claims Van Onselen backgrounded journalists against her and tweeted about “employees who witness” sexual harassment but did not report it, a tweet she believed was directed at her. Well said @latingle on the need for positive obligations on employers to deal with workplace sexual harassment. When it happens it must be called out. There should also be obligations on employees who witness it to report it, not cover it up. George claims that from early 2020 Van Onselen avoided talking to her and only communicated via text message, and further humiliated her by sending a script she had written to a minister behind her back. “On 3 September 2020, Mr van Onselen sent parts of a script of an exclusive story about the federal government, written by Ms George to the Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, prompting the Minister to demand corrections,” the claim says. The claim says in February 2021 Van Onselen failed to acknowledge that a video of George questioning the prime minister about Brittany Higgins received almost 500,000 views on Twitter and he “publicly reprimanded Ms George for forgetting to send him her script on the previous Saturday”. George claims Van Onselen variously used Twitter, Ten group emails and WhatsApp messages to undermine her. On 21 June 2021, Van Onselen sent an email to the network’s Canberra bureau email group which read in part: “…Tegan has extended her leave by another week…” “… as mentioned I’m covering this weekend anyway. It will be my 15th straight day working so Alex has very kindly offered to double check my work!!!” In June last year George told management Van Onselen’s conduct was “belittling and passive aggressive” and that his “bullying and offensive conduct had a corrosive and devastating impact on her mental health”. After a September meeting with Ten management and the media union at which George was visibly distressed, according to the statement of claim, Van Onselen published a tweet which she felt was directed at her. “Like crying wolf, if you keep looking for sympathy as a justification for your actions, you will someday be left standing alone when you really need help.” Criss Jami. George claims Van Onselen undermined her by publishing thinly veiled tweets which some people would understand to be about her. He also directly replied to one of her tweets in a “rude, intemperate, condescending and patronising” tone which implied that she was “inexperienced, ignorant and wrong”, the statement of claim says. George, who has deleted her Twitter account, is represented by employment lawyers Maurice Blackburn. “As this is an employee matter, we will not be commenting,” a Ten spokesperson said. Van Onselen has been approached for comment. Network Ten is expected to filed its defence to the claim in due course. Van Onselen, an associate editor of the Australian, is a fill-in host on Ten’s The Project, co-hosting with Carrie Bickmore while Hamish Macdonald was on leave last week. He is also a professor of politics at the University of Western Australia.

2/1/2022,"Bullying, sexual harassment and racism are common throughout Rio Tinto, according to a review of the global miner’s workplace culture conducted by Australia’s former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick. Rio Tinto’s chief executive, Jakob Stausholm, said the findings were “deeply disturbing” and he promised the company would implement all 26 recommendations Broderick made to improve its culture.  “I offer my heartfelt apology to every team member, past or present, who has suffered as a result of these behaviours,” he said on Tuesday. “This is not the kind of company we want to be.” Broderick and her team received survey responses from 10,000 of Rio’s 45,000 employees and conducted 109 “group listening sessions” around the world. There were also 85 confidential one-on-one meetings. Broderick said the majority of women who responded experienced “everyday sexism” such as being left out of meetings, not being provided with a women’s toilet or “even being asked to take notes, get coffee, or even do a colleague’s washing” while 21 women reported an actual or attempted rape or sexual assault in the past five years. “Bullying is systemic, experienced by almost half of the survey respondents,” she said in the report released by Rio on Tuesday. “Sexual harassment and everyday sexism occur at unacceptable rates. Racism is common across a number of areas.” Broderick said everyday sexism was damaging in its own right but also “creates fertile ground for more serious misconduct, such as sexual harassment and sexual assault”. Sexual harassment “was a significant organisational challenge”, she said, experienced by 43% of women working at fly-in fly-out (Fifo) and drive-in drive-out mine sites and 28% of women across the entire company. “Women at Fifo worksites spoke of eating alone in their room to avoid harassment in the dining hall and the gym; of avoiding being out after dark; of bad lighting and poor security; and of harassing and even threatening behaviour from male colleagues when they were walking to their accommodation after work,” Broderick said. “Women also spoke of the lack of consequences when they reported these incidents; and of having to carry the burden of managing the situation themselves, rather than receiving support from management or human resources.” Racism was also rife, with 39.8% of men who identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experiencing it in the past five years. Only 12.4% of men who do not identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander experienced racism in the past five years. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning More than a third of both men and women working for the company in South Africa experienced racism. “As one employee commented ‘Rio is a Caucasian oriented company,’” Broderick said. The survey found that 48.4% of employees experienced bullying – 53% of women and 47% of men. “Employees described expectations that they should ‘toughen up’ for ‘life in a global miner,’” Broderick said. She said LGBTIQ+ employees also experienced “significantly elevated rates of bullying, sexual harassment and racism”. “Overall, their comments suggest that the same hyper-masculine norms and culture that can fuel everyday sexism and sexual harassment can also fuel heterosexism, making the inclusion and safety of employees who identify as LGBTIQ+ a priority in any cultural reform,” she said. She said Rio needed to adopt the same approach to psychological safety as it does towards physical safety, where the company “recognises that workplaces cannot be free from injury or critical incidents if employees do not feel confident to report unsafe practices or risks”. “The project revealed that this confidence is not common amongst Rio Tinto employees for complex and sensitive interpersonal issues such as sexual harassment, racism and bullying,” she said. “Similarly, employees participating in the listening sessions described a ‘culture of silence’ and negative impacts from reporting; of a lack of confidentiality; and of the subject of complaints being protected and even rewarded.” One participant said they still feared the person who bullied them, even though they had left Rio. “The culture of the team was really rotten to the core while he was leader,” they said. “Once that person starts firing your colleagues for speaking out, they have a level of power over you.” Broderick commended Rio for making cultural changes over the past 12 months, but warned that the company was “only at an early stage along this path”. She said staff were confident Rio could do better. “In my interactions with the Rio Tinto leadership team, I have observed a strong desire for transformational change, as well as to make positive contributions to the societal shifts that we need to see. “There is clear recognition, however, that new approaches are needed to solve these issues.” A separate parliamentary inquiry in WA is examining sexual harassment at fly-in-fly-out mining sites. Tuesday’s report follows turmoil among the top ranks of Rio after it blew up culturally significant 46,000-year-old rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, in the Pilbara, in order to mine more iron ore.

2/1/2022,"A video of a woman apparently locked against her will in a filthy shack has gone viral in China, prompting an investigation as well as a conversation about the country’s treatment of people with mental illness. The footage, taken on 26 January, was posted to the video-sharing site Douyin the following day by a man who was shocked to find the woman locked in the rubbish-filled building in a village in Jiangsu province in the east of the country.  Standing in freezing conditions, the woman appeared to be chained by her neck to a concrete wall and she seemed dazed as she struggled to speak coherently.A video of the man who had apparently locked up the woman was posted later. As a small boy stood next to him, the man said the woman had multiple children with him, some of whom introduced themselves in the video. “Other people looked down on her,” he said, explaining why his family had taken her in. Local authorities investigating the case in Feng County said the woman had been a beggar and had married the man in 1998. They said after the birth of the couple’s second child, family planning officials had implemented birth control measures that proved ineffective. Psychiatric experts who examined the woman diagnosed her with schizophrenia, the authorities said. China’s censors have not attempted to suppress the story or discussion of it. On Weibo, a national microblogging site, a thread discussing the government investigation of the case has been viewed more than 76m times, racking up more than 25,000 comments since Monday. Mental health and sexual consent are less-discussed topics in China’s vast rural regions, where female infanticide has skewed the gender balance, causing men to outnumber women nationwide. Officials are also investigating the man, who is not facing criminal charges. Many outraged commenters have accused him of human trafficking but the Feng County government said there was no evidence to support those claims.",News/World news,Video of woman chained to wall in shack causes outcry in China,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/01/video-woman-chained-wall-shack-outcry-china-mental-illness
2/1/2022,"Astone’s throw from London’s West End, the Groucho Club is exactly the sort of spot you’d expect to find a theatre producer holding court, surrounded by rumpled media types and within earshot of a Netflix exec or three. But there is a more practical reason why Libby Zietsman-Brodie has suggested this location for our chat today: in a few hours, she has a wine tasting there. When I locate her in the upstairs bar, she is proffering a carafe of pale rosé. “A little something?” she asks, waggling a glass.  Zietsman-Brodie is on the point of becoming a full-time wine consultant and writer. After 15 years in professional theatre – initially at the Old Vic, then founding her own production company – she has decided to depart showbiz for good, at the age of 38. No regrets, she insists: “You have to keep moving. If this business taught me anything, it’s that.” She is, of course, far from alone in deciding that it’s time to get out. While no sector has been immune from the effects of Covid, the arts have been experiencing an earthquake that has been rumbling on for the best part of two years. Everyone has felt the shockwaves, from laid-off front-of-house staff (some of whom were then rehired for less pay) to musicians thrown out of work and artistic directors scrambling to keep major institutions from imploding. Early fears that more than 400,000 creatives might see their livelihoods disappear in the UK turned out, mercifully, to be pessimistic (thanks largely to government interventions such as the furlough and self-employed support schemes, and the recently expanded culture recovery fund). And not every part of the creative economy has been the same: once Covid protocols were in place, TV and film swiftly rebounded, in fact boomed – so much so that there is currently a skills shortage. Still, the overall picture is grim, particularly in visitor-reliant sectors such as theatre, live music, festivals, cultural heritage and museums. The most recent estimate by industry body Creative UK last summer calculated that over 110,000 jobs were likely to go in the UK by the end of 2021. Perhaps 95,000 of those are freelance roles, and the people doing them may never return. Music-specific figures are on a similar scale. If these estimates are right then, as 2022 begins, fewer people are working in Britain’s creative sector than at any time since 2016. And Omicron has added to the havoc: a nightmarish deja-vu of theatre and gallery closures, festival cancellations and delays. The impact on live events will be felt for months to come. It’s little wonder that so many culture professionals have considered retraining. But, assuming they’ve found work, where have they actually gone? When the pandemic began, much was written about artists jumping into temporary jobs to make ends meet: have those changes become permanent, with other sectors screaming to hire people? And, to ask what feels like a tough question amid so much gloom and uncertainty, are there success stories here too – people for whom leaving the arts has actually been a good thing? In October 2020, the UK government was ridiculed for an advert suggesting that a ballet dancer should retrain “in cyber” (even the photographer who took the picture disowned it). But can positive changes come out of being forced to reset and try something else? And what does it feel like to abandon a vocation you’ve invested so much in, and move in a different direction? Over lunch, Zietsman-Brodie reflects on her own journey. Spring 2020 was meant to mark her star-spangled return to theatre after maternity leave: three separate shows, one in the West End, another on a UK regional tour, one opening in New Zealand before heading across to Asia. “It was meant to be this big thing, saying, ‘here I am!’” she says brightly. “Five years in the planning.” The workload was so intense, she adds, that she was doing emails while about to give birth. Everyone knows what happened next: British theatres went dark, presaging the first national lockdown. When some of her colleagues banked on a return in Christmas 2020, they ran straight into another lockdown, losing even more money. “I was just so exhausted by the prospect of having to start again, build it all up, you know?” Zietsman-Brodie’s company was fortunate to receive two Arts Council grants – which helped her keep some creatives in work – but she felt that she herself was yearning to make a bigger change – and that her interest in wine could actually be it. When she was doing her tasting qualifications, a friend asked if she’d help choose wines for a wedding. “The wine company I work with said, ‘You realise this makes you a consultant?’” In December 2020 she launched her own specialist company, named after Bacchus (“God of both theatre and wine”). Zietsman-Brodie knows she is supremely lucky to have options: despite being her household’s main breadwinner, she and her partner had savings and could share childcare. But she observes that, in a wider sense, her experience echoes that of so many people during the pandemic. “It stripped everything back, forced you to ask, ‘how happy are you in the present?’ I realised, ‘Not very’.” Her production company has one show still running but, as soon as it recoups, will go dormant. “In comparison to theatre, wine feels rather lockdown-proof,” she says. For Vivienne Clavering, the shift has been more challenging. As a production manager at the Royal Opera House, she’d been wavering even before Covid: long hours and gruelling workload; tight budgets; a sense that, in her late 30s, maybe the career she’d spent so long building wasn’t all it was cracked up to be. Over Zoom, she explains that before joining the ROH she’d applied seven times to the National Theatre before finally landing the job, such was her determination. Now, she was doubting whether she was even on the right path. When the pandemic hit, she was offered furlough, before redundancies began. Her moment of clarity came during lockdown, when she moved from London to be with friends in Morecambe, helping look after their kids. “I found myself talking about teaching,” she remembers. A quick check revealed that the starting salary of a teacher – up to £32,000 in London – was only just below what she’d been earning in a senior post at one of the world’s leading opera houses. She applied for her PGCE, threw herself into the course, graduated, and when we first speak is doing supply work at a primary school near her home in south London. She loves it, she says: “When you’re in a classroom with a bunch of kids who are learning to count from one to 10, it’s amazing.” Like Zietsman-Brodie, Clavering admits it was a wrench to leave behind a career that had always been her dream. But it was easier than she imagined it would be. “I worked my butt off for 15 years, and the appreciation wasn’t always there, you know? You see people breaking around you.” When I suggest that teaching is hardly known for its work-life balance, she laughs. “Sure, it’s intense. You’re there 7am until 5pm, and of course there’s lesson planning and the rest. But, honestly, it doesn’t compare to what I was doing in opera. If you’re doing tech [technical rehearsals], you’re there until 11pm. One video designer I worked with used to call me constantly from 7am to midnight, for a full year. However hard teaching gets, no parent is going to have my phone number.” She pauses. “And if you’ve handled an opera director, you can handle a five-year-old.” How unusual are case studies such as these? While some creatives have been fortunate enough to have found a new path, hasn’t the reality for many been far more tortured? In search of answers, I call Caroline Norbury, chief executive of Creative UK. She and her colleagues have been keeping an eye on how the pandemic has reshaped the cultural sector. She says finding precise data and analysing the trends is hard, because the arts are the very definition of a gig economy. So many roles are freelance; contracts are agreed on a handshake; people do multiple jobs. And the effect has been uneven. “As with so much of the pandemic, it’s not been the same everywhere,” she says. “Some people have seen their livelihoods evaporate. Other people have never been so busy.” But, she says, even though many institutions have worked hard to help protect freelancers in particular, others were left high and dry. “If you look at the music sector, for instance, freelance musicians often supplement their income through teaching or other pieces of work, and of course a lot of that fell away and never recovered. People had no other choice but to look elsewhere.” In Norbury’s view, those worst affected have been early-career creatives, who didn’t get a chance to develop networks that could carry them through. “I think what the pandemic has uncovered is an ecosystem that is terribly fragile. It often relies on passion and goodwill – and if the chain breaks down, the system isn’t always there to support you.” What does she think about people who have experienced the transition as positive? “For many people, the pandemic has been extremely interesting in focusing their minds on what’s important. That’s great. But the people making those decisions often have a safety net. Not everyone is so lucky.” Covid should teach us a lesson, she says. Too often, the cultural sector treats its workforce as if their jobs are somehow hobbies, as if the creative reward is enough in and of itself. “These are rigorous, highly skilled, highly qualified professions. Sure, people are here because they’re passionate. But that’s not enough.” What’s needed is structural change, she adds. “We need to bring in more stability and security so that people can feel like they’re progressing. Otherwise we’ll waste all that talent.” Hard though the pandemic has been for those in British culture, at least there has been targeted help (albeit not on the scale of many mainland European countries). Artists in the US have had things far, far tougher: orchestral players and opera singers lost contracts or were thrown on unpaid furlough; unemployment rates among dancers and choreographers jumped fivefold; actors ended up on food stamps. One established performer I talk to has seen their Broadway career essentially evaporate; another has abandoned a career in cabaret to retrain in carpentry and construction. When I get hold of the American actor–puppeteer Jonathan MacMillan, a veteran of shows such as War Horse and King Kong, he turns out to be on the other side of the world, having relocated for the Australian premiere of the Disney musical Frozen. Opening night in Sydney was delayed and delayed, then the production closed; a transfer to Melbourne finally went ahead, but, like so much Australian theatre, is currently battling rising Covid rates and cancellations. When the Covid hurricane first hit, many of his US colleagues were in similarly fragile boats. “Everyone had a side gig – we call them ‘survival jobs’,” he says. “But all the survival jobs, the catering or waitering gigs, the events stuff, went away too.” As the son of a Hollywood actor who battled long periods of unemployment, the idea of transitioning had been on MacMillan’s mind for a while (he’s now 36). Suddenly, the need was urgent. Then he heard about a volunteer-run group called Artists Who Code, which supports creatives keen to learn software engineering. “I needed something future-proof, with a high salary, where I could work from home,” he explains. He enrolled on a coding bootcamp, and has been working with an Australian company for the last year. When I ask how he’s finding it, he practically radiates contentment. “I get my evenings and weekends back, and I can go on vacation and still get my wage,” he says with wonder. “Paid vacations! They’re still amazing to me.” How do people react to his change in profession? “Sure, no one gets excited when you say you’re a software engineer. The highs aren’t quite as high as in theatre. But the lows are nowhere near as low.” Has he left puppeteering behind for good? He’s still mulling the future, he replies; the fact that Frozen has finally opened means he’s suddenly busy performing again, and is considering auditioning for other shows. But he’s also interviewing at software firms too. “Doing both jobs has worked out pretty well so far,” he says. We talk about failure, the shadow of which has stalked so many of my conversations on this topic. To many people, the idea of a ballerina abandoning her artform for a job in tech sounds like an appalling waste. If MacMillan did eventually leave theatre, would it feel like failing? Absolutely not, he says: “Staying in a job that isn’t working for you, working for free, working for credits on your résumé, not standing up for your rights, not having the guts to turn a job down, for fear you’ll never work again? That’s failure, right there.”",Arts/Culture,"‘If you’ve handled an opera director, you can handle a five-year-old’: creatives who changed jobs during the pandemic",https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/01/job-change-covid-pandemic
2/1/2022,"Can a thing feel entirely impossible and entirely inevitable all at once? This, perhaps, was the paradox of the most recent Greatest Comeback In The History Of Tennis: once it began you could already glimpse how it ended. We’ve all been doing this for 15 years. The muscle memory is too strong, the emotional liturgy too deeply ingrained. This is why, from the moment Rafael Nadal started to claw back his Australian Open final against Daniil Medvedev from two sets down, it never really crossed my mind that he would lose. At the moment of victory the crowd roared and the commentator hailed the “miracle of Melbourne” and Medvedev paid tribute to an “amazing champion” and this, too, felt comforting, hypnotic, agreeably familiar. It had been another great match, probably the greatest, definitely the greatest. Nadal, with his 21st grand slam title, was now definitely the greatest, along with the other two who were also the greatest. Up in the press box, the world’s greatest sportswriters flexed their typing fingers and once again applied themselves to the pointless but highly lucrative question of legacy.  None of which is intended as a slight on the players themselves, or the level of skill required. Nadal said his career should be remembered for moments and not mathematics, but out there in the great beyond, the world was quickly proving him wrong. This was, after all, a seismic development in the “Goat debate”. A decisive move in the “Goat race”. Nadal’s victory, we were told, had pushed him to the forefront of the “Goat conversation”. With just a modicum of distance, it’s possible to observe what a strange and diminishing state of affairs this is: the men’s half of an entire sport reduced to the level of a pub debate, a swirling and interminable noise that seems to have sucked all the oxygen and a good deal of the fun out of the room. Smart, well-informed people now go on television and argue about head-to-head records and win percentages. Increasingly hostile online fandoms fire off memes and insults at each other as if they were Top Trumps. At what point does this stop feeling relevant or constructive or remotely interesting and become an industrial waste of everyone’s time? This isn’t Nadal’s fault, any more than it is the fault of Roger Federer or Novak Djokovic. Rather, the problem is with men’s tennis itself, the people who cover it, the people who follow it and the people who market it: a panoply of well-meaning characters who in the past few years have begun to indulge the sport’s myth-making to a vaguely unhinged degree. In a way, it’s a form of real-time nostalgia, this fetishisation of statistics and superlatives and numbers and records (some of which, we are breathlessly informed, will never be broken!). After all, if this were simply a fun debate then we could probably leave it there. But tennis’s consecration of its self-appointed golden era has real-world consequences, not least for the players following in its wake: the spiky Medvedev, the exciting Jannik Sinner, the brilliant Carlos Alcaraz. Attention, time, energy, media coverage, sponsorships, primetime television slots: none of this is an infinite resource. Give it to somebody and by extension you take it away from somebody else. What if a fraction of the marketing budget and column inches expended on the Big Three had instead been devoted to women’s tennis, which is quietly serving up a new era of gripping rivalries, compelling stories and new characters? The same is true of power. For all their excellence on the court, there has been a self-perpetuating element to the Big Three, a dynasty that has been enabled and encouraged, often by the same organisations responsible for broadening opportunity. Last week, Denis Shapovalov, the world No 12, claimed that the Big Three get favourable treatment from umpires. “Already they’re so tough to beat, but if you give them more advantages, then it just becomes that much harder,” he said, which raised a few eyebrows but is really just an extension of what has been a largely unspoken convention in the sport for years. Schedules and court assignments are routinely built around them. Rules are relaxed, soundings taken, medical exemptions furnished. Nadal has admitted to asking that certain umpires do not take charge of his matches. At last year’s Australian Open, Nadal and Djokovic (Federer was injured) were allowed to train at a luxury Adelaide resort while most of their rivals were forced into hotel quarantine. Yes, they have also been better than everyone else at tennis. But there is something vaguely disquieting about the way the authorities have essentially smoothed the path for them. The real question is what comes next, once the Goat conversation has finally fallen silent, once men’s tennis has finally wrung its last drops of value out of the Big Three era, once its great champions have gone and taken their banality of miracles with them. “They’ve really only marketed three players for the last decade and now it’s kind of caught up with them,” Nick Kyrgios said last week. While Nadal’s triumph will fuel the promise of an eternal empire, that day will come, and probably sooner than we think. After all, if the Big Three have taught us anything, it is that something can feel entirely impossible and entirely inevitable all at once.",Sport/Sport,Men’s tennis and the real-world consequences of its Big Three era | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/01/obsession-with-big-three-nadal-djokovic-federer-ruined-tennis
2/1/2022,"The UK’s cost of living crisis escalated in December, as inflation jumped to its highest level in almost 30 years at 5.4%. The Bank of England expects the consumer prices index will climb to about 6% by April, and the International Monetary Fund warned inflation and Omicron will dent global growth in 2022.  As inflation climbs the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is under pressure to rethink April’s hike in National Insurance as business large and small face spiralling costs. Five businesses speak about how inflation and rising energy costs are affecting them. Davide Angeletti, coffee shop ownerWhen the gas bill arrived Davide Angeletti assumed it must be a mistake. His supplier told him it was correct. “It’s terrible, in the space of three months the energy price doubled,” said Angeletti, the 51-year-old owner of Ovenbird Coffee roastery in Glasgow. He sells mostly to other businesses and, during the early pandemic, was supplying free coffee to hospitals. Angeletti was hit by surging energy costs when his supplier People’s Energy went bust in September. He was switched over to Scottish Gas. “I used to pay in a peak time £500 a month, which was manageable, and now I have £1,100 or £1,200 – we don’t know what to do.” The company’s energy rate jumped from 16.52p to 30.972p per kilowatt hour, plus a 139.330p pKWh standing charge during the handover. It wasn’t just energy; raw materials from Europe have soared, such as a pallet of raw coffee climbing from £90 (“before Brexit”) to £300-350 now. It means Angeletti must weigh up layoffs from his eight staff. “I want to keep them, we are a big family,” he said. Staff have rent to pay and are applying for mortgages. “To tell them, ‘Sorry guys I can’t afford you’ is one of the worst things I could say’.” Angeletti feels the government should do more to support small companies, perhaps an energy cap for SMEs. But, he said, “we know exactly what this prime minister thinks about business”. Angeletti frets over bringing the stress home to his family. “Anxiety is at its maximum level,” he said. Dawn Gill, jeweller“In just two years I’ve had to put my price up by £7 for some items,” said Dawn Gill who makes and sells silver jewellery and crochet gadgets in Exeter. “The cost of raw materials like sterling silver has meant I’ve had to refine my costs.” Gill, who is a sole trader and started her business in 2014, said it costs bullion dealers more to ship and import gold and silver into the UK since Brexit, with prices also fluctuating because of the pandemic. At the beginning of 2019 it was about £378 per kilogram for silver and now it’s about £550. “It’s been a bit of a nightmare,” said the 50-year-old. “At least the rise in energy prices won’t directly affect me as we generate most of our own electricity using solar panels and I tend to use just a hydrogen powered torch.” As a result she has had to adjust the prices of her items and passes the increase in cost on to her customers. “A hooker ring that requires no soldering or hallmark, because it falls under the exemption weight, was £21 in November 2019 but now sells for £24. I’ll probably have to increase the price again before April. “Then there’s the cost of packaging and consumables like burrs and blades, but one of the major concerns is the cost of sales due to Brexit – directly in the form of sales tax and allied Etsy fees, and indirectly because of paperwork and customs official registrations. “About 80% of my export pre-Brexit was to the US and Europe, with the latter making up around 40% of that.’’ said Gill. “Now I only export around a third outside the UK and even then my European exports are only around 5% of that figure.” Most of her UK customers are understanding about price increases but she has concerns about the future. “It’s been difficult during the pandemic as I normally sell at fairs and we haven’t had many,” she said. “The cost of bullion is such a volatile market that I’ve learned now to just suck it up. I’m not trying to stress about it as there’s nothing I can really do.” Andrew Hilliard, recruitment firm ownerThis year was supposed to signal a bold new future for AJ Chambers, Andrew Hilliard’s specialist recruitment firm in Southend. After 12 years operating, the 40-strong company planned to move out of leased offices into its own renovated digs. Due to inflation pressures however, “we had to scale down”, Hilliard said, and lengthen the building process “to rebuild our war chest”. A wellbeing and collaboration area, with a gym, was erased from the blueprints. “Inflation has been creeping up for sometime now,” he said. “It’s completely transformed the budgets.” There’s no way to cancel the move, which involves the revamping of an old supermarket, its new home. “We’re in too deep, we have to go ahead,” Hilliard added. His supplier for the renovation said glass prices have risen by 30%, twice, plywood prices have climbed from £7 to £36 a sheet since 2019 and Hilliard’s staff salaries have risen about 10% in the past year, forcing it to scale back hiring. Hilliard’s expansion plans were drawn up amid the post-lockdown bounce-back of last year – a time of growth optimism. “We went in really bullish, but the spectre of inflation is kicking in,” he said. “We’re really nervous about that now.” Tim Haddock, construction company ownerJust weeks ago, Tim Haddock, owner of a construction company in Derby, said he could buy a bag of backing-plaster for just over £8. This week he said it’s up to about £11. “I just keep looking at prices and thinking, that’s ridiculous, it’s insane,” he said. Haddock, 56, is director of a small building company, Kay and Haddock, employing three people and working on extensions, conversions and domestic refurbishing. He said the garage revamping business boomed during the pandemic; people wanted to elevate their homes during lockdowns. But the start of 2022 feels uncertain. “I am seriously worried about price increases,” he said. “I seriously believe we’re rapidly heading to a point where customers will just balk at the cost and stop having work done,” which would raise the grim prospect of layoffs. Softwood tongue-and-groove timber cladding cost about £30 for a few square metres before Covid, he said, but now it’s almost £90. Plaster was roughly £4-£5 a bag in 2019, now about £10. And Brexit [and global supply chain] effects have compounded the problem – sometimes “you just can’t get hold of stuff” or must spend hours searching. The national insurance hike in April adds further pressure. “Prices are rising every week,” Haddock said. “I’m a pretty laid back guy – you have to be in the construction business as everything changes all the time – but I’ve just been shocked.” Steve Keeton, managing director of Nippon Electric GlassSteve Keeton, the managing director of Nippon Electric Glass, had expected a stellar year for the fibreglass manufacturer in 2021. “Then we saw energy prices rising. At first our advisers were telling us not to worry, that there would be a small peak in energy prices and they’ll soon come down. But they didn’t,” he said. The UK’s only maker of reinforced fibreglass directly employs 350 staff at its Wigan site, and supplies its materials to the wind power and automotive industries across Europe. Thanks to the green energy boom its biggest challenge used to be keeping pace with demand. But energy prices are beginning to take a toll. “We lost money, on an operating level, every single month over the second half of last year. It took the shine off what otherwise should have been a great year last year,” Keeton said. The glass industry, like many manufacturing sectors, is a high intensity user of both gas and electricity which faces an uncertain future due to rocketing energy market prices. “I personally don’t want a government bail out,” Keeton said. “As a leader in my business I understand that my job is to create the right environment for my team to be successful. So what I expect from the government is for them to create the environment for business to be successful. That means a stable and predictable energy supply situation, and the infrastructure to support this,” he said.",News/Business,‘Anxiety is at its maximum level’: cost of living crisis hits UK businesses,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/anxiety-is-at-its-maximum-level-cost-of-living-crisis-hits-uk-businesses
2/1/2022,"Javanese Hailey found her daughter hunched over in pain inside their home in Manassas, Virginia, about 32 miles south-west of Washington DC. The nine-year-old could barely walk because her stomach hurt so much, Hailey said, recalling that Sunday evening in October.  So, she asked her basketball- and gymnastics-loving fourth-grader the question that had become routine in recent weeks: on a scale of zero to 10, how bad is the pain? It’s above 10, her daughter, Haley Bryson, told her. For about two months, Haley had experienced some combination of headache, fatigue, stomachache, sore throat, earache or breathlessness – reporting pain levels normally around six or seven. She would collapse into bed when she got home from school and ended up losing 17lb from her already small frame, her mother said. “There did not seem to be a pattern to her symptoms,” said Hailey, a middle and high school math teacher. “Some days were worse than others. Some days she couldn’t even get out of the bed because her stomach hurt so much.” She added: “It was the scariest thing I ever experienced in my life.” The symptoms began soon after Haley and her mother contracted Covid-19 in early August. They both had a relatively mild reaction and recovered. But days later, Haley became sick again. In October, after more than half a dozen trips to her pediatrician, urgent care and the emergency room, she was referred to Children’s National hospital in Washington DC, diagnosed with long Covid and treated in its Pediatric Post-Covid Program, which treats all ages up to 21. Though long covid diagnosis is considered very rare in children, Haley is not alone. Some children across the US have reported an array of symptoms – ranging from headaches, stomachaches and dizziness, to fatigue, brain fog and mood changes – long after their initial infection. Long Covid can last anywhere from four weeks to months – although definitions vary – and, while it presents differently based on developmental stage, doctors say it can affect virtually any age, even infants. Of the more than 848,000 people who have died in the US from Covid during the pandemic, 727 have been under age 18, according to the CDC. Less than 1.5% of child Covid cases have resulted in hospitalization, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). However, vaccine availability and uptake for children has consistently lagged behind adults in the US. It wasn’t until May that the CDC recommended the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for children ages 12 to 15, and then not until November that it recommended it for those ages five to 11. Children under the age of five are still not eligible. Only 20% of five- to 11-year-olds have been fully vaccinated, and 55% of 12-to-17-year-olds, while all adult age groups are at least 60%, according to the CDC. Plenty of questions surround pediatric long Covid, including exactly how common it is. One Danish study published in the European Journal of Pediatrics in December surveyed about 37,500 children. It found less than 1% of Covid-positive children reported symptoms lasting more than four weeks, compared with a control group. A report from April out of Italy that surveyed 129 children who tested positive for Covid found that about 43% experienced at least one symptom more than 60 days after their initial infection. In recent months, doctors at some pediatric Covid centers have reported an increase in referrals and patient load. Some have set about expanding clinics or restructuring schedules, while others have found themselves working their way through long waitlists. The reason for the increase is probably twofold, explained Laura Malone, a physician at the Kennedy Krieger Institute’s Pediatric Post-Covid-19 Rehabilitation Clinic. There is a lot more understanding and acceptance of the condition, leading more families to seek treatment. At the same time, there has also probably been an uptick in long Covid cases following the Delta-fueled surge, as it can take months before patients with the condition are diagnosed and treated after infection. “The larger the denominator, the more people you have that do have the infection, the more numbers or higher numbers you’re going to get with those with complications from it, like long Covid,” explained Malone, who said Kennedy Krieger’s clinic has had to expand twice over the last six to eight months due to an increase in cases. Over the past year, the clinic, which meets three half days a month, has seen 47 patients, with over one-third of those patients coming in September, October and November. Dr Alexandra Brugler Yonts, director of the Pediatric Post-Covid Program at the Children’s National hospital, said they are booked out until March. She explained that over half of the program’s 60 patients had come in just the last three months, despite opening in May 2021. “A lot of the thought is, ‘Oh it’s just a cold, you know, we get through that.’ But we don’t yet know why certain folks get long Covid and others do not,” she said. “And so you’re getting infected, you’re taking a gamble, rolling the dice that you might, hopefully won’t be one of the ones that has long-term complications.” The long Covid clinic at Texas Children’s hospital, which has seen a total of 62 patients, has been at its max of six patients or higher a month since September, according to Dr Kristen Sexson Tejtel, its co-director. It’s now in the process of increasing from half days to full days to double the number of patients it can see. Dr Sarah Risen, its co-director, said increased awareness of long Covid is probably causing at least part of the swell. “With this increased awareness and acceptance, it allows providers also to start to diagnose and treat and help support the child and the family earlier,” She said. Dr Carlos Oliveira, pediatric infectious diseases doctor at Yale Medicine, said the Yale New Haven children’s post-Covid care program received 6-8 long covid referrals per month between August and November.  He said there are only theories about what causes long Covid. One hypothesis is that some of the virus proteins linger in the body and continually leak into the bloodstream, causing an immune system reaction. Another one is that it’s a type of autoimmune process in which antibodies made against the virus attack the host, leading to damage long after the virus is gone. There have been several studies launched in recent months into long Covid. In an especially large-scale effort, the US National Institutes of Health announced it was starting nationwide studies. The research will include children. In the meantime, Dr Frank Bell, pediatric infectious disease physician at Swedish medical center in Seattle and a member of the Washington Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics board of trustees, emphasized the importance of vaccination. “By being careful about your exposures … and by being immunized, and by your supporting kids in their recovery from Covid, we think we’ve got a good way to bring that small risk down to something that’s even less likely to happen and be a worry for an individual child or his or her family,” he said. Doctors have already begun to prepare for the impact the Omicron surge could have on the numbers of long Covid cases. “It’s hard for me to say what will happen, but we are preparing for a large wave of kids … because the numbers of adolescents and children who have been infected are so high,” said Oliveira. “It’s bound to lead to a higher number of long Covid based on the numbers alone.” For Haley, who recently turned 10, five months after her initial infection, her mother said virtually all of her symptoms have finally gone away. But the fear has not. Each time her daughter complains of a minor stomachache or headache, Hailey said she gets worried that the condition has returned. “It just takes me back in a flashback to everything that we went through,” she said. But Haley said she’s just happy to be feeling better so she can get back to her playdates and gymnastics. “I can have more playdates and have more fun on playdates. I can do arts and crafts and gymnastics and kind of just be silly and run around the stairs and stuff,” she said. When asked what her pain level is now, she said with little hesitation: “Zero!”",News/Society,‘The scariest thing’: the children living with long Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/children-long-covid-coronavirus
2/1/2022,"Britain’s housing market has made its strongest start to the year since 2005, with annual house price growth rising to 11.2%, according to the UK’s biggest building society. Nationwide said the average price of a home hit £255,556 in January, the sixth consecutive monthly increase. The annual growth rate accelerated 0.8 percentage points from 10.4% the previous month, reaching its highest level since June.  Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said: “Housing demand has remained robust. Mortgage approvals for house purchase have continued to run slightly above pre-pandemic levels despite the surge in activity in 2021 as a result of the stamp duty holiday, which encouraged buyers to bring forward their transactions to avoid additional tax. “Indeed, the total number of property transactions in 2021 was the highest since 2007 and around 25% higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck. At the same time, the stock of homes on estate agents’ books has remained extremely low, which is contributing to the continued robust pace of house price growth.” Many forecasters, including Nationwide, predict the housing market will cool later this year. Gardner noted that house price growth had outpaced wage growth by a wide margin since the coronavirus pandemic struck. For example, a 10% deposit on a typical first-time buyer home is now equivalent to 56% of total gross annual earnings, a record high. Similarly, a typical mortgage payment as a share of take-home pay is now above the long-run average despite mortgage rates remaining close to all-time lows. While affordability has worsened, household finances have been hit by sharp increases in the cost of living. Consumer price inflation reached 5.4% in December, its fastest annual rate since 1992, and is set to rise further as the energy price cap is lifted in April. This is likely to force the Bank of England to raise borrowing costs again. Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and a former Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors residential chairman, said the Nationwide survey “confirms what we have seen on the ground – a resilient market with prices still rising in response to improving but continuing low stock levels. Looking forward, higher interest rates and inflation will inevitably have some impact on the pace of price increases and number of transactions.” Guy Gittins, the chief executive of the London-based estate agent Chestertons, expects the London market to remain at high activity levels in the first half of this year. “For many, 2022 feels like a new chapter and house hunters have been eager to begin the new year in a new home. Following on from a busier than usual December, London’s property market has continued to see record numbers of buyers registering throughout January. “While spacious properties or homes with an outside space remain sought-after, apartments in some of London’s more central boroughs are experiencing a steady comeback. This is particularly driven by professionals who are returning to the office and are seeking a nearby home as well as international investors and students.”",News/Business,UK housing market makes strongest start to a year since 2005,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/uk-housing-market-strongest-start-average-price-nationwide
2/1/2022,"Mombasa Lenapir briefly strokes the waters of Kenya’s Lake Turkana with his hand as he boards the rickety canoe. A piece of hippo tooth or kalate, dangles from his right earlobe, evidence that he once killed a hippo in his younger years as a rite of passage. Lenapir, who says he is 70 but looks older, is a member of the El Molo community that has lived on the shores of Lake Turkana for millennia. Two years ago, he was forced to move out of his home when rising waters engulfed his village, Komote, turning it into an island. Fearing being marooned by the expanding lake, Lenapir and other families built new homes on the mainland, while some opted to remain on the new island and use canoes to travel between the two settlements.  “Can you believe we are riding on what was once dry land?” says Lenapir. “I have never seen the water rise to this level. Children used to walk to school and play in a field, now under water, a few years ago. In the past, you could have driven up to these homes. Now parents have to pay boat owners for their children to get to school. It is difficult for the sick to get medical assistance, especially at night,” says Lenapir. Another big loss for the community was a water pumping station that used to supply freshwater but now lies beneath the surface of the lake, forcing the El Molo people to rely on one of the most saline lakes in Africa for their water instead. The high levels of fluoride discolour teeth and weaken bones. Children, in particular, are prone to water-borne diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera and typhoid. Surrounded by a barren landscape and dotted with black volcanic rocks, Lake Turkana, a Unesco world heritage site, has increased in area by more than 10% over the last decade, submerging close to 800 sq km of land. It has obliterated El Molo’s fishing sites, destroyed freshwater infrastructure, engulfed burial grounds and brought the community in proximity with ferocious Nile crocodiles, hippos and snakes. A government-sanctioned report, published in 2021, says the rise in water levels in Lake Turkana and other Rift valley lakes is due to increased rainfall in the lakes’ catchment areas over the last few years, unsustainable land-use practices leading to soil in runoff water and geological activities within the Rift valley system. A 2021 UN Environment Programme report stated how the climate crisis will lead to heavier rains over the lake’s key river inflows creating a further rise in the water levels over the next 20 years, with more social, cultural and economic impacts for nearby communities such as the El Molo. “Such a possible increase in inflow will result in an increasing water level in Lake Turkana. Thus, the flooding which occurred in 2020, which was considered a rare event, is likely to become more regular in the future without any adaptation measures. The new evidence of continuing rising lake water levels is partially based on climate change scenarios and a predicted change in rainfall patterns,” says the report. With an estimated population of 1,000, the El Molo were already living on the edge. Their language is listed as extinct by Unesco’s Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger, as there is no known native El Molo who can fluently speak the dialect. El Molos belong to the Cushite ethnic group, but intermarriages between the tribe and nearby Nilotic communities, such as the Turkana and Samburu, have contributed to the language’s disappearance. Its future now lies with schoolchildren who are learning to speak a rudimentary form through a grammar book and folklore. The El Molo are said to have originated from Ethiopia before settling in about 1,000BC on the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya. Their diet consists largely of fish caught using traditional spears, harpoons and nets. The expanding lake has affected their key source of livelihood. “Rising waters mean more fish are now found deeper into the lake. It is too windy to venture further offshore since our boats can capsize easily. We have lost a few of our members through such incidents. Without a good daily supply of fish, our lives are in danger since we cannot farm as the whole place is rocky,” says Julius Loyok, a local tour guide. After 20 minutes, Loyok helps anchor the canoe on the shoreline of Komote island, before helping Lenapir to disembark. Bypassing homesteads, they head to some traditional shrines known as gantes, where older men like Lenapir offer sacrifices when a tragedy hits the community, to curse enemy tribes, pray for the rain and protection from snake bites. There are fears that if the lake continues to expand, the revered shrines, lying close to the water’s edge, will become inaccessible. “Our language is dead, our culture is going and our homes are being swallowed by the water,” says Lenapir. In neighbouring Layeni village, the water almost laps some homes, and half of the graves in the community burial site lie submerged. It is only a matter of time before the other half, a few metres from the lake, are submerged too. In a community where the dead are revered, the sight of the graves under water is particularly distressing. “This is painful. Sometimes you need moments of solitude here. But now I have to ride a canoe with other people to reach the submerged graves. We buried the dead and now the graves are buried too,” says Lenapir. A few miles from the El Molo villages, the Desert museum houses several artefacts belonging to the community, such as food and tobacco containers and tortoise shells used as plates. Ntalan Ogom, the museum’s caretaker and a member of the El Molo community, says this is perhaps the only place where future generations will learn of a lost tribe, an extinct language and a dying culture. “We relied on the lake to live. Now it’s killing our people.”",News/Global development,‘We relied on the lake.

2/1/2022,"My first encounter with the military came on 4 February 2021, three days after the coup. From the back of my friend’s motorcycle, I hid my camera under my clothes and attempted to photograph soliders as they drove in trucks through my native city of Mandalay carrying their guns. I couldn’t get a good picture, however, because one of the vehicles started following us and we had to retreat. Within days, almost the whole country had erupted in protest. I couldn’t stay still any more, and I joined the crowds on 7 February.  ‘The whole country had erupted in protest. I couldn’t stay still any more, and I joined the crowds’ The first crackdown came a week later. Water cannon, smoke bombs and sound grenades sent us running in every direction. It was a totally new experience for me, and although I had tried to prepare myself, when it actually happened I felt shocked and scared. Still, I returned to the streets the next day, as protesters gathered in front of a state-owned bank to urge its workers to join a growing civil disobedience movement and go on strike. First, soldiers and police fired rubber bullets and air guns to disperse the crowd. Then, they went after us journalists. More than 20 people chased us with sticks and guns and tried to surround us. I somehow managed to escape and, luckily, people from the neighbourhood pointed where to run and one man opened his door for me. I climbed up to the rooftop of his building. Looking down on the street below, I saw soldiers and police fire catapults and air guns at fleeing crowds. I recognised four journalists among them, and watched with horror as one of them, my friend, was caught. I saw them beat him with their batons and rifle butts, and kick him; before he managed to get away, they also destroyed the video camera he had borrowed from me . I tried to film this with my phone, but couldn’t get a clear view, and almost got hit myself by a stray projectile that pierced the steel rail of the balcony in front of me. The protests and suppression only intensified from there. On 20 February, crowds gathered at a dockyard to support striking ship workers as soldiers and police attempted to force them back to work. I saw regime forces aim their guns at protesters’ heads and open fire with sniper rifles. I also saw the determination of the protesters, who ran for cover and fired back with catapults whenever they had the chance. Many protesters were shot, and there was blood everywhere. Two of them were killed that day, including a 16-year-old boy. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. After that, bloody crackdowns happened daily. Initially after the coup, we journalists wore helmets and vests that said Press, thinking the gear would protect us, but by early March, we didn’t dare to identify ourselves and instead focused on not standing out. ‘I saw the determination of the protesters’ On 3 March, I saw a young woman demonstrating on the frontline of the protests, wearing a black T-shirt that said: “Everything will be OK.” I tried to photograph her, but soldiers were everywhere and I had to run. From a nearby rooftop, I saw soldiers and police hunt down protesters as they attempted to hide. I tried to keep photographing, but rubber and steel bullets hit the wall behind me and smoke grenades exploded too. But as soon as I had the chance, I ran back on to the street. A woman makes a three-fingered salute at soldiers. The gesture, which originated in The Hunger Games films, has been adopted by protesters as a symbol of resistance and support for democracy I saw bloody wounds and scattered brains; I also saw the body of the young woman wearing the black T-shirt. Her name was Kyal Sin, and she had been shot in the head. The 19-year-old – one of three people killed during that protest and at least 28 unarmed protesters killed across the country that day – has since become an icon of the protest movement. I photographed her funeral the next day. Throughout these traumatic experiences, I set my mind on my responsibility to document everything. With that motivation, I was able to continue. Clockwise from top left: young protestors try to protect themselves with handmade shields; a protester among the crowd flies the flag of the All Burma Federation of Student Unions, which has been active in the anti-coup movement; the shirt and sandals of Ye Swe Oo, shot in the chest on 13 March; the body of Saw Pyae Naing, a 21-year-old student By early April, the brutal suppression of protests had convinced many people that street demonstrations were not enough to defeat the junta. Some left the city to join the rapidly growing armed revolution, while others held early-morning guerrilla protests on narrow streets. Although they had changed tactics to avoid being shot or run over by military vehicles, soldiers and police still found ways to violently put down opposition. I tried to go out with my camera a few times by hiding it, and then tried to document the protests on my phone, but it was too dangerous – and I couldn’t get a good shot. Finally, I stopped going out altogether. ‘Journalists often encourage me to flee the country. But I have never thought about leaving’ It has now been nearly 10 months that I have not been able to go out and photograph. But even staying inside, I don’t feel safe at all. I haven’t been home since the coup, and I am constantly moving from place to place. Journalists often encourage me to flee the country and report from abroad. They might wonder why I stay here in this situation. But I have never thought about leaving. My purpose is to document what is happening here for the public and the world, and I believe that the time will come for me to go out again. I am waiting for that time. When it comes, I will resume my work no matter the risks. Moe is a photojournalist based in Mandalay.
