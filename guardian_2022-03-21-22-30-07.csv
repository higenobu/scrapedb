3/21/2022,"A second whistleblower has gone public to say it was “widespread knowledge” in government that Boris Johnson ordered the prioritisation of an animal charity based in Afghanistan for evacuation during the Taliban takeover last summer. Josie Stewart, who worked in the Foreign Office for seven years, including a stint in the Kabul embassy, suggested senior civil servants in the department had lied to cover up the embarrassing episode. She told parliament’s foreign affairs select affairs committee that the direction from the prime minister was evidenced in multiple messages on Teams, emails and in conversations around the crisis centre, which was set up to try to help the tens of thousands of desperate Afghans trying to flee. Johnson has refuted that he had anything to do with the decision for the animal charity, Nowzad, to be allowed to evacuate staff and animals through Kabul airport. But mounting evidence has suggested the prime minister did give a direct order for Nowzad to be prioritised, while many others – including Afghans who helped the British government – were left behind. After a Foreign Office insider came forward in December to reveal the chaos and confusion at the heart of the crisis response, Stewart, who worked on the evacuation, corroborated the claims by revealing further “systemic failures”. She told the commitee the decision to approve Nowzad’s staff for evacuation “was not in line with policy, as there was no reason to believe these people should be prioritised under the agreed criteria”. “It was widespread ‘knowledge’ in the FCDO crisis centre that the decision on Nowzad’s Afghan staff came from the prime minister,” Stewart said in newly-released testimony to the foreign affairs committee. “I saw messages to this effect on Microsoft Teams, I heard it discussed in the crisis centre including by senior civil servants, and I was copied on numerous emails which clearly suggested this and which no one, including Nigel Casey [the government’s special representative on Afghanistan and Pakistan] acting as ‘Crisis Gold’, challenged.” In the aftermath of the evacuation, the Foreign Office’s permanent secretary, Philip Barton, claimed that civil servants had included Nowzad in the “potential cohorts to be considered for evacuation”. Stewart said: “While factually accurate, from what I heard and saw, Nowzad staff were included as a late addition only in response to this ‘PM decision.’ This occurred against the previous judgement of officials.” She told the committee that she was sent an email from Casey that said the national security adviser was speaking to No 10 about the possibility of evacuating Nowzad. Stewart told the committee it appeared Barton and Casey may have “intentionally lied”. After Casey claimed he had searched his emails and found nothing of relevance to the issue, Stewart suggested he had either not looked for the simple terms “PM” and “Nowzad”, deleted messages or found the correspondence but decided they were unimportant. Stewart also tackled the suggestion from Foreign Office minister Lord Goldsmith that “it is not uncommon in Whitehall for decisions to be interpreted or portrayed as coming directly from one department or another or even the prime minister, even when that is not the case”. She noted: “I have never in my career seen any such thing. Governance would fall apart entirely if this were the case.” Stewart admitted she realised by coming forward she was likely to lose her job and that she would be devastated to leave the Foreign Office. But she said: “I feel a strong sense of moral injury for having been part of something so badly managed, and so focused on managing reputational risk and political fallout rather than the actual crisis and associated human tragedy.” Of the way people were selected for evacuation, Stewart said the criteria was “so broad as to be largely meaningless” and that prioritisation was “based on who happened to open or forward which random email”. The suggestion by Barton that people with specific expertise of Afghanistan gave input from across government was also dismissed as “idealised fantasy”. In a direct attack on then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, Stewart told the committee his claim that all requests for help made by MPs were being looked at was false. “There was no urgency whatsoever accorded to doing anything actually meaningful with any of the emails at this stage,” she said of the promise Barton is likely to be questioned on the fresh allegations when he faces the foreign affairs committee on Monday afternoon. A government spokesperson has previously defended the response, saying that staff “worked tirelessly to evacuate more than 15,000 people from Afghanistan within a fortnight … [in] the biggest mission of its kind in generations and the second largest evacuation carried out by any country”.",News/Politics,"Boris Johnson did prioritise animal charity for Afghan evacuation, MPs told",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/21/boris-johnson-did-prioritise-animal-charity-for-afghan-evacuation-mps-told
3/21/2022,"It felt as if the appointment of Felix Magath was peak Hertha. We should have known better. On the eve of the first game of the new era, at home to Champions League-chasing Hoffenheim, the new coach tested positive for Covid, and was confined to his Berlin hotel room. When it became known that Magath would be unable to take to the touchline for his projected debut with illness, it felt utterly typical of Hertha’s wretched season to date. “I thought he was joking,” said sporting director Fredi Bobic of the moment when he took Magath’s call to receive the news. Those waiting for a must-watch Hertha – for better or for worse – might have felt deflated, but they need not have worried. Enter Mark Fotheringham, the 38-year-old Scot who played at Celtic, Norwich, briefly under Magath at Fulham and, more importantly, a German speaker with experience as assistant to former Magath foil Tomas Oral at Karlsruhe and Ingolstadt. While the 68-year-old paced his room in quarantine, Fotheringham prowled the touchline, giving Hertha presence and personality. “You can tell that the team has been given a jolt,” said defender Niklas Stark. “Mark is an amazing guy, and the energy he has is amazing.” Before Christmas, Fotheringham was being linked with the Dunfermline job, after their German takeover last year. Now, he was leading a Bundesliga giant, and winning. Yes, winning. Hertha’s first victory in 2022 was courtesy of a performance from a team that looked unlike anything else that had emerged from the Olympiastadion’s home dressing rooms in recent months, and lifted the team out of the bottom two. It was easy to look at the first line-up of the Magath/Fotheringham regime and think that three central defenders, with Stark just in front of the recalled Dedryck Boyata and Marc-Oliver Kempf and two further defensive midfielders in Lucas Tousart and Santi Ascacibar around him, represented safety first. Structure didn’t equal scared here, though. Hertha played with certainty and ambition. They needed their rub of the green too, of course, having not had much of that in recent times, and when a clean-through Jacob Bruun Larsen spooned the ball over the top with only returning goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow to beat in the 25th minute, Hertha had the luck that they’d been missing. They didn’t waste it. After Stark headed an opener from Marvin Plattenhardt’s free-kick late in the first-half they never looked back, scoring twice more from Plattenhardt set-piece deliveries to run out 3-0 winners – set-pieces that Magath credited Fotheringham with organising in a Sunday interview with Kicker from his hotel. “Mark Fotheringham did most of the work,” Magath said. “On the bench, in training, in discussions with the players.” Not that Magath was totally absent. He spoke to his players by video link before the match, as well as at half-time, while goalkeeping coach Andreas Menger passed the coach’s messages to Fotheringham on the bench during the game. “I don’t even know if I’m allowed to say it,” said Marco Richter furtively, “but yes, the boss was there.” The drama will continue even if, as the club hopes, the results build to pull the team away from the bottom. Main investor Lars Windhorst’s public attack on president Werner Gegenbauer and his “cliques” underlined that Hertha will continue to be a soap opera. The start of Magath’s spell, though – and he is still tight-lipped on any possibility of extending his stay beyond the season’s end – suggests that there is life and even the potential for harmony on the pitch. Bayern Munich 4-0 Union Berlin, Cologne 1-1 Borussia Dortmund, Greuther Fürth 0-0 Freiburg, Hertha Berlin 3-0 Hoffenheim, Mainz 4-0 Arminia Bielefeld, RB Leipzig 0-0 Eintracht Frankfurt, Stuttgart 3-2 Augsburg, Wolfsburg 0-2 Bayer Leverkusen Bochum v Borussia Mönchengladbach – match abandoned The weekend’s other big moment was a rather less edifying one, with Bochum’s Friday night home game with Borussia Mönchengladbach abandoned in the 69th minute – with Gladbach leading 2-0 – after assistant referee Christian Gittelmann was hit by a beer cup thrown from the stands. Gittelmann was treated for whiplash and bruising and while VfL apologised, the club were incandescent with the incident that has sullied their thus-far excellent season. Injured forward Simon Zoller wrote on Twitter that the action “was disrespectful to all those who work their arses off every day to experience this journey,” while CEO Hans-Peter Villis “A few people are destroying everything we’ve been building here for years,” said Villis, with the club having produced a video before the game to encourage spectators to stop throwing cups. Bochum have three days to submit their findings as they search for the thrower before the DFB announce the next stage of a disciplinary procedure, with a large fine and the possibility of a game behind closed doors (which would be estimated to cost the club another €1 million) both floated.  It was a strange week for Robert Lewandowski, who caused midweek panic by pulling up in training and leaving the pitch at Säbener Straße looking crestfallen. It proved to be just a scare, though, as he started and scored twice in the 4-0 demolition of Union, taking him over the 30-goal mark in the Bundesliga, and equalling another Gerd Müller record of 30 or more Bundesliga goals in five different seasons. Manuel Neuer kept a clean sheet on his record 311th Bundesliga victory and it was an achievement given Bayern’s decimated defence, which saw the teenage Tanguy Nianzou head in his first goal for the club.  So having looked under pressure for the first time in weeks after Axel Witsel’s late midweek winner for Borussia Dortmund at Mainz cut the gap at the top to four points, patched-up Bayern ended up extending their lead as BVB were held at Köln, stretching the champions’ lead back to six. We’d seen this one before, with Marius Wolf’s marvellously-taken goal from a raking Jude Bellingham pass the signal for a torpid first-half performance, bookended by a deserved Sebastian Andersson leveller for the hosts. Erling Haaland, starting his first game in 57 days, could have had a winner but referee Daniel Siebert blew for a Salih Özcan foul on Emre Can rather than playing an advantage when the Norwegian was clean through.  After their tough week of losing Florian Wirtz and Jeremie Frimpong to season-ending injuries plus Europa League elimination at the hands of Atalanta, Leverkusen needed a good news story and Paulinho provided it. The Brazilian, on the way back after a couple of injury-blighted years (and still only 21, remember), came on as a late substitute and scored two fine goals, his first in two years, to author victory at Wolfsburg.  On the week in which CEO Thomas Hitzlsperger finally announced his departure from Stuttgart after six years of service and some fractious exchanges in the boardroom, the team continued their unexpected upturn on the pitch. VfB twice came from behind to beat – and leapfrog – relegation rivals Augsburg in a five-goal thriller, with Omar Marmoush winning an argument with Chris Führich over who should take a free-kick to bend in the second equaliser before on-loan Portuguese teenager Tiago Tomás hit a winner. “It was very emotional,” said coach Pellegrino Materazzo, who understandably turned a blind eye to the dispute between Marmoush and Führich.",Sport/Football,Felix Magath and Scottish sidekick ‘jolt’ Hertha Berlin into life | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/21/felix-magath-scottish-sidekick-fotheringham-hertha-berlin-bundesliga
3/21/2022,"A man whose body was found buried in the back garden of a house in Northampton during a murder inquiry has named as Nicholas Billingham. Fiona Beal, 48, appeared in court on Monday accused of killing 42-year-old Billingham between 30 October and 10 November last year. The defendant, reported to be a primary school teacher, spoke only to confirm her age and to give her address as the house in the Kingsley area of Northampton where the body was found. Beal was arrested at a hotel in Cumbria, more than 200 miles from home, shortly after midnight on Wednesday. Northamptonshire police began conducting an extensive search of her house the same day. Forensic officers and specialist search teams, including a cadaver dog used to locate bodies, were deployed to the address, and the discovery was made on Saturday. Police said the remains were to be taken to Leicester for forensic examination by a Home Office pathologist. At Northampton magistrates court, Beal was told she was not entitled to apply for bail and was ordered to appear at the town’s crown court on Tuesday. On Sunday, DCI Adam Pendlebury, of the major crime team of the east Midlands special operations unit, said: “Regrettably, I can confirm that a body has been found in the rear garden of the address. We believe it to be that of a missing 42-year-old male, but formal identification has yet to take place. “Police officers have been conducting house-to-house inquiries in the area over the past couple of days.

3/21/2022,"A new TikTok account can be shown falsehoods about the Ukraine war within minutes of signing up to the app, according to an investigation by anti-misinformation outlet NewsGuard. The company, which monitors the trustworthiness of news outlets across the web, ran a pair of tests to assess how the video-sharing app treated information about the conflict. It found that a new account that did nothing but scroll the app’s algorithmically curated For You Page watching videos about the war would be funnelled towards false or misleading content within 40 minutes. “Toward the end of the 45–minute experiment, analysts’ feeds were almost exclusively populated with both accurate and false content related to the war in Ukraine – with no distinction made between disinformation and reliable sources,” the research team wrote. “At a time when false narratives about the Russia-Ukraine conflict are proliferating online, none of the videos fed to our analysts by TikTok’s algorithm contained any information about the trustworthiness of the source, warnings, fact-checks, or additional information that could empower users with reliable information.” Among the false claims shown to the researchers were the myth that the US has bioweapon laboratories in Ukraine, and the accusation that Putin was “photoshopped” on to footage of a press conference he gave in early March. Videos also claimed that fake footage was real, and that real footage was fake: videos purportedly of the “Ghost of Kyiv” shooting down Russian jets were taken from a video game, while real videos from the war were decried as fake by pro-Russian accounts. “Some of the myths in the videos TikTok’s algorithm fed to analysts have previously been identified as Kremlin propaganda,” the researchers said, by the organisation’s Russia-Ukraine Disinformation Tracking Center. To carry out the test, NewsGuard’s research team simply made new accounts on the app and spent 45 minutes scrolling through the For You Page, stopping to view in full any video that looked like it was about the war in Ukraine. Although TikTok does not provide detail about how its algorithm works, it is believed to take into account time spent watching various videos, as well as other signals including likes, comments and who a user follows or has blocked. By watching every video on the war that appeared on their page, the researchers will have “trained” the algorithm to show the new accounts content about the conflict, but not provided any specific signals in favour of misleading material. TikTok’s search function similarly blended real and false content, delivering videos that contained false or misleading claims in the top 20 results for searches of “Ukraine”, “Russia”, “War”, “Kyiv”, and “Donbas”, NewsGuard said. A TikTok spokesperson warned that the experiment can only offer limited conclusions about the way the app works in the real world, since it fails to mimic standard view behaviour. “We continue to respond to the war in Ukraine with increased safety and security resources as we work to remove harmful misinformation and help protect a safe experience on TikTok,” they added. “We also partner with independent fact-checking organisations to support our efforts to help TikTok remain a safe and authentic place.” The video-sharing app has seen a big increase of content related to the war, with videos tagged #Ukraine receiving more than 30bn views by the end of last week. One report from the New York Times found that, proportionally, Ukraine content on TikTok outpaces that on platforms more than twice its size.",News/Technology,"TikTok algorithm directs users to fake news about Ukraine war, study says",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/21/tiktok-algorithm-directs-users-to-fake-news-about-ukraine-war-study-says
3/21/2022,"Earlier this month, Team Trump claimed in court that their efforts to nullify Joe Biden’s victory could not possibly have been fraudulent or be described as a criminal conspiracy, because those in and around the White House had merely been acting on the basis of sincerely held suspicions. This sparked the latest round in the never-ending debate over whether or not Republicans actually believe that the election was stolen from them. Politically, it is important to push back against the opportunistic ways in which Republicans up and down the country have been using the “big lie”. But if we are trying to understand what is animating the right’s rapidly accelerating radicalization against democracy, binary assumptions of Republicans as either true believers or power-hungry cynics are not very helpful and actually obscure more than they illuminate. In some fundamental way, Republicans are both. What we really need to grapple with is why so many Republicans are convinced the outcome of the election was illegitimate regardless of whether or not there were specific procedural irregularities. Surveys have consistently indicated that a clear majority, probably about two-thirds, of Republicans consider Biden an illegitimate president. It’s highly likely that many of them are well aware that some of the specific conspiratorial claims emanating from the right – fake ballots? Lost ballots? “Illegals” voting? – are bogus. But they don’t seem to care about the specifics. They just believe Biden shouldn’t be president. What is most alarming is the underlying ideology that leads so many on the right to consider Democratic victories invalid – even if they concede there was nothing technically wrong with how the election was conducted. It has become a core tenet of the Republican worldview to consider the Democratic party as not simply a political opponent, but an enemy pursuing an “un-American” project of turning what is supposed to be a white Christian patriarchal nation into a land of godless multiracial pluralism. Conversely, Republicans see themselves as the sole proponents of “real” America, defending the country from the forces of radical leftism, liberalism and wokeism. Even if they don’t subscribe to the more outlandish conspiracies propagated by Trumpists, many Republicans agree that the Democratic party is a fundamentally illegitimate political faction – and that any election outcome that would lead to Democratic governance must be rejected as illegitimate as well. Republicans didn’t start from an assessment of how the 2020 election went down and come away from that exercise with sincerely held doubts. The rationalization worked backwards: They looked at the outcome and decided it must not stand. In other words, accusations of fraud gain plausibility among conservatives not because of empirical evidence, but because they adhere to the “higher truth” of who is and who is not legitimately representing – and therefore entitled to rule – “real” America. It is worth paying attention to how reactionary intellectuals have been dealing with the 2020 election. We certainly wouldn’t expect Trump, most Republican officials, or the conservative base to devour rightwing treatises. As much as they would like to believe it, these reactionary thinkers are not leading the movement. But they tend to articulate the radicalizing authoritarian spirit that is threatening American democracy in strikingly stark terms. In this way, the rightwing intellectual sphere provides a crucial window into the energies and anxieties that are animating the right more broadly. In March 2021, the magazine American Mind published a particularly instructive essay by Glenn Ellmers, entitled “‘Conservatism’ is No Longer Enough”. American Mind is a publication of the Claremont Institute, a rightwing thinktank in California that has become home to some of the most outrightly pro-Trumpian intellectuals. It is notable that Ellmers makes no claim that the 2020 election was “stolen” – he doesn’t allege manipulation, voter fraud, or conspiracy, and in fact explicitly acknowledges that more people voted for Biden than for Trump. He does not peddle conspiracy theories. Yet Ellmers maintains that the outcome of the 2020 election is illegitimate and must not be accepted. According to Ellmers, Biden’s presidency represents an “un-American” idea of multiracial pluralism – something that is fundamentally in conflict with what he refers to as “authentic America”. In his view, everyone who voted for Joe Biden and his “progressive project of narcotizing the American people and turning us into a nation of slaves” is also “un-American” and therefore not worthy of inclusion in the body politic. Ellmers declares that “most people living in the United States – certainly more than half – are not Americans in any meaningful sense of the term”. Only “authentic Americans” are allowed in Glenn Ellmers’ United States – a racialized idea of “the people,” most clearly represented by “the vast numbers of heartland voters”. On the other side are “un-American” enemies, not coincidentally characterized by their blind admiration for a young Black artist: “If you are a zombie or a human rodent who wants a shadow-life of timid conformity, then put away this essay and go memorize the poetry of Amanda Gorman.” Ellmers’ racist, anti-pluralistic vision is remarkably radical: he wants to redraw the boundaries of citizenship and exclude over half the population. Ellmers is outraged precisely because he accepts the fact that a majority voted for Biden, that “authentic Americans” have become the minority in a country which they are supposedly entitled to dominate. Here we have a striking glimpse of the depth of despair underlying the pervasive siege mentality on the right. What’s scandalous about the 2020 election, in this interpretation, is not that it was “stolen”, but that “un-American” forces straightforwardly won. Reactionaries like Ellmers have internalized the idea that they represent a persecuted minority, fighting with their backs against the wall in a desperate effort to defend “authentic America”. They dispute the legitimacy of the 2020 election not necessarily on the basis of fraud and conspiracy but because democracy itself subverted the will of “real America” by allowing the “wrong” people too much of an influence on the fate of the country. Trump’s incessant lies represent a vulgar, clumsy, narcissistic strand of conspiratorial thinking; those lies are shared by some, opportunistically used by many, and widely accepted on the right because they adhere to a “higher truth”: “we” are entitled to rule in America. That’s what is behind the widespread support for, or willingness to accept, any kind of suspicion, regardless of whether or not there is any shred of empirical evidence. If an election doesn’t result in “us” being in power, it must be illegitimate, as we are “real America”; if it puts “them” in charge, it cannot be accepted, as they are out to destroy the nation. Whether or not Republicans actually believe conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, most are absolutely convinced the result was illegitimate – and they are all too willing to use allegations of fraud or ally with conspiracy theorists if it helps prevent future “illegitimate” outcomes. It is precisely the mixture of deeply held ideological convictions of white Christian patriarchal dominance, of what “real America” is supposed to be and who gets to rule there, and the cynical opportunism with which these beliefs are enforced that makes the assault on democracy so dangerous.

3/21/2022,"Lithuania is urging the European Union to ban Russian oil as cracks begin to show in how far the EU will go in imposing further sanctions on the Kremlin’s war machine. As Ukraine defied a Russian ultimatum to surrender the port city of Mariupol, EU foreign ministers gathered in Brussels to discuss further sanctions against Russia at the start of an intense week of diplomacy. But after four rounds of sweeping EU sanctions in three weeks, tensions are emerging. The Baltic states and Poland are calling for tougher measures, including an oil embargo, while Germany fears a short-term energy ban would cause joblessness and fuel shortages. Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said it was “unavoidable to start talking about the energy sector” especially oil, which he said was “the biggest revenue to the Russian budget” and “also quite easily replaceable” for the EU. The EU, which imports 27% of its oil from Russia, has so far not joined the US and UK, in an embargo. Germany has warned that a short-term ban on oil and gas could cause unemployment, poverty and people running out of petrol. Few other western economies are as dependent on Russian energy as Germany: 55% of the natural gas, 52% of the coal and 34% of mineral oil used in the country comes from Russia. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged Europe to stop all trade with Russia: “No euros for the occupiers. Close all of your ports to them. Don’t export them your goods. Deny energy resources. Push for Russia to leave Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said in a video speech on Monday. Addressing Germany directly, he said: “You have the strength. Europe has the strength.” Arriving at the meeting, the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, declined to answer a question on what could trigger sanctions on Russia’s energy sector. She said the images from Ukraine were “simply heartbreaking” and made it “even clearer that the EU, that the global community that believes in a rules-based international order, has to isolate the Russian leadership”. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said the bloc would continue discussing further sanctions “especially in relation to energy”, as he condemned Russia’s bombing of civilians in Mariupol, who have endured nearly four weeks under siege. “What is happening in Mariupol is a massive war crime,” Borrell said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine three and a half weeks ago, the EU has agreed unprecedented sanctions against a UN security council member, hitting industries including banking, energy and air transport, as well as imposing asset freezes and travel bans on 685 people and 14 entities linked to Vladimir Putin and his war machinery. Some diplomats from countries seeking tougher measures fear there is growing sanctions fatigue. “There is this feeling in the room that we would like to sit down and take a breath, because the first three or even four weeks have been incredibly difficult not to Ukraine but to Europe,” Landsbergis said. “It’s a very bad message to those who are actually fighting in Ukraine.” Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said he also supported a ban on energy exports. He said: “Looking at the extent of the destruction in Ukraine right now, it’s very hard to make the case that we shouldn’t be moving in on the energy sector, particularly oil and coal.” The Danish foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, said his country would support the “strongest sanctions that we can agree upon”, including a ban on Russian ships docking at EU ports and restrictions on overland transport from Russia and its ally Belarus. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, warned that an oil embargo would have “a very serious negative impact on Europe’s energy balance”. Over the weekend, Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, called for a total ban on trade with Russia, although the Czech Republic, a central European ally, said this was not realistic. “I do not think this proposal will get support,” the Czech finance minister, Zbyněk Stanjura, said. Meanwhile, some sanction-cautious countries put more emphasis on closing loopholes in existing measures. “It is easy to write down more sanctions in the newspaper, but there is a world behind every measure,” said one EU diplomat, who added that “everything can be on the table, but we must keep the unity”. “It’s easy to say we should do oil sanctions or energy sanctions or close the ports but to think it through for a minute, that entails so much,” the diplomat said. “To make sure these sanctions can have their true effect and reach their destination is quite a cumbersome and difficult process.” EU leaders are expected to discuss further sanctions with the the US president, Joe Biden, later this week. Biden will speak to Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz, Mario Draghi and Boris Johnson on Monday, ahead of a trip to Europe later this week. There he will attend Nato and EU summits in Brussels, before travelling to Poland on Friday, for discussions on “efforts to support Ukraine and impose severe and unprecedented costs on Russia for its invasion”, according to a White House statement. The western alliance is also expected to discuss how to stop Russia circumventing sanctions via China and other countries. Kofod said the EU was discussing how to use its diplomatic weight to ensure countries in the rest of the world, “will choose the right side of history”, namely, he specified, condemning Putin’s war and signing up for the political isolation of Russia. EU foreign ministers are also expected to signal their approval of a further €500m (£420m) to fund weapons and military equipment for Ukraine, after Borrell announced the funding earlier this month before it had been agreed. The €500m adds to €450m in weapons and €50m in non-lethal aid, promised to Ukraine at the start of the war, but the new sum must be approved by the German Bundestag before it can be rubber-stamped in Brussels. Baerbock confirmed on Monday that EU funding for military procurement would increase to €1bn to “stand in full solidarity with Ukraine”. Ministers will also sign off an EU security and foreign policy strategy for the next decade, which was drafted months ago, but heavily rewritten following the Russian invasion.

3/21/2022,"Gillian Mosely’s thoughtful movie about Israel/Palestine raises important issues and discusses the historical background going back to the British mandate after the first world war – it’s surprising how many British parliamentarians still behave as if all this has nothing to do with them. Above all, Mosely emphasises that eternal liberal imperative: that everyone involved should simply keep talking. The film avowedly comes from the director’s own perspective: having grown up in a Jewish and pro-Zionist family in Britain, she has come to question it all and sympathise with the Palestinians. And if we feel that for all this film’s supposed evenhandedness she is indeed doing exactly this – favouring the Palestinian side – well, perhaps that is inevitably part of the peace process. If the status quo is to be changed then it is the overdogs who have to give ground. Sometimes I felt that her commentary comes dangerously close to faux-naïf: discussing the biblical justification for the Jewish homeland in Israel, she intones: “That is what many Jews – including me – were raised to believe. But is it true?” Oddly, despite Mosely’s emphasis on her own personal story (which is what we are invited to accept gives a particular emotional or moral authority to her criticisms of Israel) she does not actually interview any of her own Jewish family or friends. Instead, Mosely ranges far afield in Israel and Palestine, interviewing Jews and Palestinians of differing views and does so with scrupulous sympathy and fairness. What her film gets right is the importance of the friendship between Jews and Palestinians which does actually exist, ignored by the news media who see things in black and white. Her best interview is with the Israeli heavy metal band Orphaned Land who have Jews and Palestinians in their lineup. Just as there is such a thing as cultural soft power, there could also be soft reconciliation, soft dialogue. As to the subject of antisemitism under the guise of anti-Zionism, this is raised just once in this film: with a closeup of the nauseating swastika-equals-Star-of-David banner that still gets hoisted at demonstrations.

Prep 10 minCook 10 minServes 4For the dressing1 large garlic clove, peeledA thumb of ginger, peeled3 tbsp soy sauce2 tbsp rice-wine vinegar2-3 tbsp toasted sesame oil2 tsp honey3 tbsp tahini1-2 tsp chilli oil, plus extra, to serveFor the soup4 spring onions, slicedA big handful each of coriander and mint, chopped250g soba noodles400g purple sprouting broccoli, roughly choppedSesame seeds, to serve For the dressing, finely grate the garlic and ginger into a large bowl, then stir in the soy sauce, rice-wine vinegar, sesame oil, honey, tahini and chilli oil, and set aside. Slice the spring onions and wash, pick and chop the herbs. Bring a pan of salted water to the boil, then cook the noodles for five to six minutes, until tender but not mushy. While they are cooking, fetch a colander and a large bowl of cold water. Once the noodles are cooked, drain them through the colander, then tip into the water and, using your hands, wash them of their starch. This will keep them silky and stop them clumping together. Now steam the broccoli for a few minutes until tender, adding the noodles to the steamer after one or two minutes, to heat them through again. (Or serve the noodles cold, if you prefer.) Add the noodles and broccoli to the dressing and toss with the spring onions and herbs. Taste and add a splash more vinegar or soy, if needed. Transfer to a plate and serve with extra chilli oil drizzled over the top and a scattering of toasted sesame seeds. This salad is delicious with slivers of bashed-out pork tenderloin served on the side, or serve it as a side for pieces of sticky roast chicken.
