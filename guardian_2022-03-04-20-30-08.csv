3/4/2022,"There is still the possibility of a diplomatic settlement that would bring an early end to this dreadful war and Russian military withdrawal while safeguarding the vital interests of Ukraine. Indeed, if the Russians are ever to withdraw, a diplomatic agreement on the terms of withdrawal will be necessary. The first round of Ukrainian-Russian talks has now taken place in Belarus, and a member of the Ukrainian delegation has stated that “The parties identified a number of priority topics in which certain solutions were outlined”. The West should back a peace agreement and Russian withdrawal by offering Russia the lifting of all new sanctions imposed on it. The offer to Ukraine should be a massive reconstruction package that will also help Ukraine to move towards the West economically and politically rather than militarily – just as Finland and Austria were able to do during the Cold War despite their neutral status. The demands by the Russian side are that Ukraine should sign a treaty of neutrality; engage in “demilitarisation” and “denazification”; and recognise Russian sovereignty over Crimea, which was seized back by Russia after the Ukrainian Revolution. These demands are a mixed bag of the acceptable, the unacceptable, and the undefined. The option of neutrality for Ukraine has often been called “Finlandisation”, and perhaps the determined and unified Ukrainian response to Russian aggression over the past week has given a new meaning to that term in the case of Ukraine. For like the Finns in the “winter war” of 1939-40, the Ukrainians have also been abandoned militarily by the West, which has declared publicly and repeatedly that it has no intention of fighting to defend them. On the other hand, it seems that the extraordinary courage and resolution with which the Finns fought convinced Stalin that to rule Finland would be too much of a challenge. Finland became the only part of the former Russian Empire not to be incorporated in the USSR, and during the cold war, though neutral by treaty, was able to develop as a successful social market democracy. Similarly, we must hope that the courage and determination of the Ukrainians has convinced Putin that it will be impossible to run Ukraine as a Russian client state, and neutrality is the best deal he is going to get. President Volodymyr Zelensky has publicly hinted that a treaty of neutrality may be on offer; and he is right to do so. For two things have been made absolutely clear by this war: that Russia will fight to prevent Ukraine becoming a military ally of the West, and the West will not fight to defend to defend Ukraine. In view of this, to keep open the possibility of an offer of Nato membership that Nato has no intention of ever honouring, and asking Ukrainians to die for this fiction, is worse than hypocritical. As to “demilitarisation” and “denazification”, the meaning and terms of these will have to be negotiated. Demilitarisation is obviously unacceptable if it means that Ukraine must unilaterally dissolve its armed forces; but the latest statement by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has suggested that Russia would accept a ban on missiles based in Ukraine. This could be modelled on a similar guarantee to the US that ended the Cuba Missile Crisis. As for “Denazification”, this presumably means that Ukraine should ban extreme right wing nationalist parties and militias at Russia’s behest. This is a completely unacceptable interference in Ukraine’s internal affairs; but perhaps Ukraine could make a counter-offer that would meet Moscow’s concerns about the rights and future of the Russian minority in Ukraine by guaranteeing these under the Ukrainian constitution – which, by the way, is something that the West should support anyway, in accordance with its own principles. There remains the demand for recognition of the Russian annexation of Crimea. Here, respect for international law (slightly ambiguous in the case of Crimea, which was only transferred from Russia to Ukraine by Soviet decree in 1954) must be tempered by considerations of reality, the prevention of future conflict, and the interests of ordinary people in the region – which is essentially what we have been asking Russia to do in the case of Kosovo. Ukraine has already lost Crimea, and cannot recover it, as Serbia cannot recover Kosovo, without a bloody and unending war that in this case Ukraine would almost certainly lose. Our principle in all such disputes must be that the fate of the territories concerned must be decided by local democratic referenda under international supervision. This should also apply to the Donbas separatist republics. These proposals will be denounced as “rewarding Russian aggression”; but if Putin’s original aim really was to subjugate the whole of Ukraine, then by such an agreement Moscow would fall far short of its maximal goals. Moreover, such an agreement would give Russia nothing that it had not in practice already achieved before launching the invasion. The West is morally right to oppose the monstrous and illegal Russian war and to have imposed exceptionally severe sanctions on Russia in response, but would be morally wrong to oppose a reasonable agreement to end the invasion and spare the people of Ukraine terrible suffering. America’s own record over the past generation gives no basis for such self-righteous hyper-legalism.

3/4/2022,"The first time we meet the Macbeths in Amy Leach’s production, they are mourning the loss of a child. Parenthood, progeny and posterity are at the heart of this new version of the Scottish play. Anxieties about lineage always haunt Macbeth, but here they’re brought to the fore. Leach’s production opens with men being ripped from their families to go to war. The upturned chairs that scatter the stage suggest domesticity disrupted, as wives and children are left behind. In the crucible of conflict, a new sort of family is forged between Duncan and his thanes. In just a few brief scenes, these men become a believable band of brothers, making the bloody rupture of Macbeth’s betrayal all the more shocking. Another relationship that’s utterly convincing is between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth – a partnership on which productions can rise or fall. Their scenes together radiate passion, tenderness and a fierce hope for the future, which pushes them to their murderous deeds. When first informed of his fate, Tachia Newall’s Macbeth seems startled by his own dark ambition, which gradually consumes him. As a pregnant Lady Macbeth, meanwhile, Jessica Baglow brings new shades to this character. Here’s an intelligent, striving woman who, if she must be defined by the role of mother, is determined to birth kings. Hayley Grindle’s striking set design distils the play’s opposing elements: sky and ground, ethereal and earthy, vaulting ambition and grubby misdeeds. The stage is covered with dirt, above which rise metal towers topped with lights that reach towards the heavens. This space is dominated by a platform that raises and lowers to suggest blasted heath, castle drawbridge and the stage within a stage upon which life “struts and frets his hour”. Like Leach’s taut production of Hamlet in 2019, this Macbeth is thriller-like and almost cinematic. Its driving momentum is only briefly punctured by a couple of lulls in the second half, when the action occasionally falters. The central theme of legacy is sometimes over-emphasised, and the witches aren’t entirely convincing in their otherworldliness. But while Leach doesn’t solve all the theatrical problems of Shakespeare’s play, she does make it newly compelling.

3/4/2022,"Istarted writing this piece in an underground garageturned bomb shelter in the western Ukraine city of Lviv. Situated about 80km from the Polish border, it has not yet been shelled by the Russian military. While the air-aid sirens were going off every day during the first week of the full-scale invasion of my country, Tuesday night was the first time I bothered to take cover. I was trying to score responsibility points with my parents: they were about to go over the border to Poland and needed to see that their daughter, bent on remaining in Ukraine, was not putting herself in harm’s way. Yet the harm is all over my country. Vladimir Putin, better known in Ukraine as khuilo (“dickhead” – my people have never been known for their deference), planned to conquer this land in two days. His delusion has been exposed by a pre-written article, Offensive of Russia and the New World, which was mistakenly published by one of the main Russian news outlets on 26 February. Having failed to crush the armed forces of Ukraine with his murderous blitzkrieg, Putin is terrorising its civilian population. Thousands of civilians arrive here in Lviv every day from the east as well as the capital. They sleep on the floors in theatres and research institutions. Local businesses are transforming their operations to support the war effort. Instead of beer, a trendy brewery is filling bottles with molotov cocktails. A metallurgical plant specialising in copper cable is producing anti-tank obstacles. Teenagers are fortifying checkpoints with sandbags instead of going to school. Hundreds and hundreds of volunteers are queueing at military registration offices to sign up and join the army. And while the most vulnerable are fleeing westwards, more than 80,000 Ukrainian economic migrants, mostly men, have come back home to fight. I can relate to their sentiment, having come here from London at the beginning of February in anticipation of the big war to come, looking for a way to be of help. Whereas Lviv has been spared the artillery fire so far, my home region of Zaporizhzhia, in the east of the country, is the scene of active fighting. The Russians have been shelling the nuclear power plant there – the largest in Europe, and the source of a fifth of Ukraine’s power. Before the shelling began, peaceful residents gathered at the entrance to Enerhodar, the small town where the plant is based, to meet the invaders – a few handfuls of civilians trying to shield the world from a nuclear catastrophe with their bodies. An initial fire caused by the shelling has now been extinguished, but the Russians have seized the plant and the danger is far from over. Ukraine’s military and civil society should not be facing the Kremlin’s madman and his troops alone. It is bad enough that the international community has been looking in the other direction for eight years, since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine. It is bad enough that the world has failed to protect Ukraine as it promised when, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country gave up the world’s third-largest nuclear arsenal in exchange for security assurances. This is the choice that Ukrainians have been deprived of by the western appeasement strategies and inaction. Further and ever more painful sanctions, enforcing a no-fly zone over Ukraine to protect civilians, halting all business with Russian companies, stopping trading in oil and gas and ramping up the military support of Ukraine will force the aggressor to negotiate a ceasefire instead of turning up to negotiations with grotesque ultimatums. I said goodbye to my parents on the seventh day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. They have now crossed the border into Poland, and are about to join my husband in Germany. I am staying in Lviv to help coordinate displaced people coming from the east and reporters coming from the west. I promised to meet my family under the peaceful sky and raise a glass to Ukraine’s victory. They know that I am obsessive about keeping my promises. However, I will require an unprecedented global effort to help me with this one. Sasha Dovzhyk is special projects curator at the Ukrainian Institute London.

3/4/2022,"We have no choice but to show respect. To be clear, it is unequivocal good news that The Godfather is being rereleased. The pretext is its 50th anniversary but, really, it should be reissued every year for the sheer cinematic hell of it. Excellent, too, that it is being followed by both sequels. (Yes, The Godfather III deserves your love.) To see these genius films on a big screen, in a dark room, the way they were intended, etc etc: bellissimo! And yet on another level: irrelevant. In 2022, we are watching The Godfather all the time already. The influence is everywhere; in movies but far more than that. For now, let’s stick with entertainment and consider Succession. Deep inside 2022’s most state-of-the-art storytelling are Francis Ford Coppola’s 50-year-old themes: the boss and the shadow his power casts across cursed adult children. The dramas of Waystar Royco have their own energy, but also enough of a debt for each run to end in homage. Warning: spoilers. The first season finale took place backstage at a wedding, how The Godfather began; in the second, a Fredo-style kiss preceded betrayal; in the third, another wedding, more treachery and a closing shot that winked so hard at Coppola, fans called Matthew Macfadyen’s family-by-marriage sap “The Tomfather”. The Godfather is right here and now. And how odd that can seem, not just from the half century between it and us, but because it was old world even in 1972. The original came in a burnished past tense, set in the 40s and 50s; The Godfather II rewound decades more. Then the movies themselves became nostalgia trips. For years, they have been symbols of the high ground of 70s cinema, to many film lovers a lost Eden after which movies were wrecked by merch and franchises. The truth is trickier. The Godfather itself was nothing if not a slab of blockbuster, a pricey adaptation of Mario Puzo’s salacious bestseller. Now, we would call it an event movie: Jaws before Jaws. Then, it towered over the box office. And if Star Wars is blamed for Hollywood “sequelitis”, The Godfather II gave it the bug beforehand. Coppola also sold the studios on a particular profile of director: young, movie-obsessed, frantic with big ideas. Steven Spielberg, say, or Coppola’s business partner George Lucas. Cue most of multiplex cinema history. There are the endless mob movies, of course. But more potent than mere weight of numbers is the scale of influence exerted by just one dynasty. Like a remarried parent, The Godfather has the original offspring, II and III. Then it has more: Goodfellas and The Sopranos. Scorsese’s masterwork is the coked-out angry son, upending Dad’s view from the top. The onward connection to David Chase’s Tony Soprano meant Coppola helped change not just film but TV, too. And like Tony, the show spent much of its time unpicking its inheritance. Not least the lot of Italian-Americans. The mass appeal of Puzo’s novel lay in an illicit glimpse of a hidden culture. But with Coppola, something loving was at work as well. The immigrant experience of untold millions arrived from Sicily or Abruzzo was spotlit at last. A byproduct of the hubbub around the first two Godfathers was that a group long kept at America’s margins finally got membership. It doesn’t feel coincidental that, with only rare exceptions, such as James Caan and Andy Garcia, Coppola insisted that Italian-Americans be played by Italian-Americans. The understanding of identity and representation was years ahead of its time. It was also double-edged. By the time the credits rolled on The Godfather II, the tropes were fixed. A whole diaspora was tied to crime and murder. Your horse was unsafe with Italian-Americans. But double edges always were the deal with The Godfather. Coppola’s old-world vision was released to an America convulsed by Vietnam, economic turmoil, racial tension and a sense of lost order. The past filled cinemas and a pining for tradition seeped into the world beyond. Among the things the film was about, one was patriarchy: power in the hands of one white man. Women stayed marginal. The Godfather helped put nostalgia in the middle of modern life. And when politics felt useless, it offered Don Corleone. He was not refused. And eventually, politicians caught up. Boris Johnson always names the climactic bloodbath of The Godfather as his favourite film scene. Just this January, a journalist reported him quoting the movie at a hapless photographer, Marlon Brando impersonation and all. Naturally, a joke is made of it. Still, the similarity with his style of government is obvious: a circle of cut-throats and suck-ups, rule by threat and favour. As ever, he echoes Donald Trump, whose whole shtick is Corleone cosplay. (“Classics,” Trump says of the first two films.) And then there is Vladimir Putin, his Russia long called the definitive “mafia state”. A Putin of a different era met Coppola over tea at the Kremlin in 2005. He namechecked The Godfather. Ukraine is sadder than any movie, but to watch the three films now is also to see the poisoned result of when killers dream of legacy. In the course of the first film, Corleone tells Al Pacino’s Michael he had hoped his son would become a politician. Instead, politics became The Godfather. We are ruled by men who do impressions of the Don. And kissing the ring crosses party lines. The first two films are also the favourites of Barack Obama. But politicians’ weakness for attention would make them poor mafiosi. A Cosa Nostra relies on silence: omertà. Invisible power thrives elsewhere. Because another literal subject of The Godfather is capitalism; Coppola said it was his biggest theme. There, omertà remains the watchword. How many of us could identify the heads of the companies whose products we buy? How much corporate skulduggery remains out of sight? And if the first lesson of The Godfather is trust no one, the second is that each generation ends up living the life of the one before. So it has proved. Fifty years after Don Corleone, the mafia is a husk; America itself is coming undone. But the birthright of The Godfather keeps being handed down. Now as then, our world is strictly business.

3/4/2022,"Morris Day, frontman of the Prince-formed group the Time since 1981, has alleged that the late musician’s estate has forbidden him from performing under the name Morris Day and the Time. “I’ve given 40 years of my life building up a name and legacy that Prince and I came up with,” Day wrote in a Facebook post. “A name that while he was alive, he had no problem with me using. “However, now that Prince is no longer with us – suddenly the people who control his multimillion dollar estate, want to rewrite history by taking my name away from me, thus impacting how I feed my family.” The Prince estate told Vulture magazine that Day’s post was “not entirely accurate” although added no further detail. A representative said the estate had had “amicable discussions” with Day over his use of the name and was “surprised and disappointed” to see his post. Prince conceived the Time as an outlet for the material he wrote earlier in his career, allowing him to experiment with other styles. He sourced some members of the group from the local Minneapolis funk band Flyte Time – among them Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis – and added others including Day, a childhood friend. As teenagers, Day and Prince formed their first band, Grand Central, which they later renamed Champagne. Day’s mother managed the group. In the Time, Day was the only band member allowed to perform on their self-titled 1981 debut album. Prince played all the instruments and instructed Day to follow his vocal demos note-for-note. The group had a tempestuous relationship with Prince and his band that resulted in rivalries and disciplinary actions being handed down from the rock star. Day played Prince’s nemesis in the 1984 film Purple Rain, but quit the band a year later after arguing with Prince. The band split and Jam and Lewis became the biggest music producers of the era, working with the likes of Alexander O’Neal (an early member of Flyte Time), Janet Jackson and Day, now a solo artist, on the single Fishnet. The Time reunited for the album Pandemonium in 1990 – a tie-in with Purple Rain sequel Graffiti Bridge – but soon had another acrimonious split.

3/4/2022,"London’s ultra-low emission zone will be extended to the whole of Greater London by the end of next year under plans set out by the mayor, Sadiq Khan. City Hall said “bold measures are required” to reduce toxic air pollution and cut congestion in the capital, as well as tackling the wider climate emergency. Khan has ruled out a proposed £3.50 boundary charge for motorists to enter Greater London, as well as a daily clean air charge, to apply to all except zero-emission vehicles. The two alternatives were under consideration to raise revenue for Transport for London (TfL), before the latest round of emergency funding from the government. Instead, the mayor has instructed TfL to consult on expanding the ultra-low emission zone (Ulez) from the inner boroughs to the whole of London. The Ulez, in which drivers of all but the newest diesel vehicles, and some older petrol vehicles, are liable to pay £15.50 daily for cars, and more for larger vehicles, was expanded to the north and south circular roads last October. City Hall said toxic air caused by traffic was leading to stunted lung growth in children and almost 4,000 premature deaths a year – mainly in London’s outer boroughs. It has found that all of London’s hospitals, medical centres and care homes are in areas that breach the World Health Organization’s guidelines for nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. The expanded Ulez would cut the number of the most polluting cars on London’s roads by a further 20,000-40,000 daily. Khan said he would help charities, small businesses and vulnerable Londoners to adapt with a scrappage scheme. The mayor said: “The triple challenges of tackling toxic air pollution, the climate emergency and congestion mean we need to further reduce emissions from vehicles in London. We simply don’t have time to waste. “This is also a matter of social justice – with air pollution hitting the poorest communities the hardest. Nearly half of Londoners don’t own a car but they are disproportionally feeling the damaging consequences polluting vehicles are causing.“We have too often seen measures delayed around the world because it’s viewed as being too hard or politically inconvenient but I’m not willing to put off action we have the ability to implement here in London.” With other research putting the cost of congestion in London at £5.1bn last year, Khan said the fairest long-term solution would be smart road-user charging – but said TfL was years away from being able to run such a scheme.

3/4/2022,"The words “caught Marsh, bowled Lillee” encompassed a world of cricketing pain for batsmen during the 1970s and 80s, as the ferociously fast Australian bowler Dennis Lillee combined with the stockily acrobatic wicketkeeper Rod Marsh to claim more Test match victims – 95 in total – than any other pairing in history. Marsh, who has died aged 74, was the perfect tough sidekick for Lillee, with whom he shared a scowling, moustachioed Aussie pugnaciousness and a ferocious will to win. While Lillee stood menacingly with the ball at the end of his run, incoming batsmen could expect to be met with a pithy comment or two from Marsh about the future likelihood of their need for emergency dental work or a prolonged spell sampling hospital food. Even if Lillee failed to deliver on such prophecies, there were good odds on a snick going through to Marsh’s gloves as another statistic was added to the pile. “I’ve played with Dennis so much that most of the time I know what he’s going to do before he’s bowled,” Marsh once said. The number of their Test victims was matched by a more or less equal total of dismissals for Western Australia, for whom they played in further deadly combination when not on international duty. During a Test career that ran from 1971 to 1984, Marsh was responsible for more than 350 dismissals – a world record at the time and still the fourth highest tally ever. Although his thickset build was not ideally suited to duties behind the stumps, he was superbly nimble in all facets and at his most impressive when diving full length to retrieve a wayward delivery or take a spectacular catch. Complementing his athleticism with fierce concentration and a natural belligerence, after a shaky start at international level he was able to make himself into one of the most admired keepers in the history of the game. In addition he was a more than useful left-handed batsman whose stock in trade was the forceful rearguard action lower down the order. Later on he made a successful transition into coaching and administration, including as head of the Australian Cricket Academy and, in a surprise move, as a selector for the old enemy, England. Born in Perth, Western Australia, to Ken, a truck driver, and Barbara, Marsh went to Kent Street senior high school, captaining the Western Australia schoolboys’ team at 13 and playing for West Perth’s first XI as a specialist batsman at an early age. He made his first-class debut for Western Australia a year before Lillee in 1968, batting at No 5, and when he was picked for his first Test in Brisbane against England in 1970, again just prior to Lillee, it was as much for his batting as his wicketkeeping. Marsh had a disconcerting start to his Test career with the gloves, dropping several chances in his early games and earning himself the derogatory nickname “Iron Gloves” in the press. But his batting was more successful, and in his fourth Test, in Melbourne in 1971, he made 92 not out, only missing out on a century because the skipper, Bill Lawry, declared the innings closed. Against Pakistan at Adelaide in 1972 he became the first Australian wicketkeeper to hit a century – 118 – and by then, through hard work and application, he had begun to put his keeping mistakes firmly behind him. As Marsh’s confidence grew, so too did his combativeness, particularly in harness with Lillee but also, from 1972 onwards, with another aggressive fast bowling figure in Jeff Thomson. Any good Test wicketkeeper would have profited from working with such a fine opening bowling partnership, but it would be difficult to imagine anyone other than Marsh serving them with such memorable and feisty impact. Despite his gladiatorial nature, however, Marsh’s bark was often worse than his bite, and he was capable of great sportsmanship. In the Centenary Test between Australia and England at Melbourne in 1977, with England going well and Derek Randall in imperious form on 161, a ball from Greg Chappell took the edge of Randall’s bat and Marsh tumbled to hold the catch. When the umpire Tom Brooks gave Randall out, the Englishman began to walk back to the pavilion to a standing ovation, until Marsh stepped in to tell Brooks that he had failed to catch the ball cleanly, bringing the batsman back to continue his innings. It was a heart-warming moment that did much to soften the pantomime villain image he had acquired among many England supporters. Marsh’s last match, against Pakistan in Sydney in January 1984, was also Lillee’s swansong, and they walked off the field together. In 96 Tests he had claimed 355 dismissals, including 12 stumpings, and had a batting average of 26.51, with three hundreds. He also played in 92 one-day internationals, where his aggressive batting was especially useful, and was one of the rebel Australian players who spent two years out of the mainstream game playing for Kerry Packer’s rival World Series cricket circus between 1977 and 1979. In all first-class cricket he was responsible for 803 dismissals with a batting average of 31.17. Post-retirement Marsh had a spell as a cricket commentator for Channel Nine (1986-90) before becoming coach and director of the Australian Cricket Academy (1990-2001). There he helped bring through a generation of world-conquering players, including Ricky Ponting, Glenn McGrath and Adam Gilchrist. In late 2001 he was a surprise appointment to a similar job heading the England and Wales Cricket Board National Academy, the following year also becoming a Test selector and holding both roles until he left in 2005, having helped England to regain the Ashes. Later he had a consultancy role with the South Australian Cricket Association and spent time as head coach of the global ICC cricket academy in Dubai before being appointed in 2011 to a newly created post overseeing the entire cricket coaching network in Australia. He served as chairman of the Australia selectors for two years from 2014. Made MBE in 1981, Marsh was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. He is survived by his wife, Roslyn, a PE teacher whom he married in 1969, their sons, Dan, Jamie and Paul, and his brother, Graham, the former European Tour golfer.

3/4/2022,"With Russian forces pushing deep into Ukraine, bombarding Kharkiv, Kyiv and other cities, and an unprecedented wave of western sanctions pushing the rouble down to an all-time low, it is hard for any of us to tear our eyes away from the news. But the currents of history that led up to this crisis are deep and complex, and understood in profoundly different ways in Moscow and Kyiv. The Gates of Europe: A History of Ukraine by Serhii Plokhy is a great place to start reading up on the background to the crisis. It tells the story of this large but less well-known country without the Moscow-centric bias that many of us Russian speakers have long struggled to free ourselves of. It is learned and considered, but lightly written and leavened by anecdotes. If you want to understand how Putin’s claims to be denazifying Ukraine are so offensive to ordinary Ukrainians, as well as his insistence that they actually want to be Russian, it’s important to read about the country’s experience in the first half of the 20th century, when Bolsheviks and Nazis alike rampaged over its flat terrain, killing millions upon millions of people. Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin, by Timothy Snyder, is that rare thing – a history book that makes you totally re-evaluate what you thought you knew. The history of Russia is better known than that of Ukraine in the west, but what about that of Vladimir Putin, who has hidden many of the details of his own career? The essential book to understand the Russian president is Putin’s People: How the KGB Took Back Russia and Then Took on the West by Catherine Belton, which begins with his time in the St Petersburg administration before telling the inside tale of how he built a nuclear-armed mafia state, cowing his allies and rivals alike. If you want to understand why Putin has long been so popular, it’s useful to know what Russia was like before he came to power, and how a small group of oligarchs came to own all the country’s most valuable resources in a period of chaos and misery. The best book on this is Sale of the Century: The Inside Story of the Second Russian Revolution by Chrystia Freeland, who worked as a journalist in Moscow and is now deputy prime minister of Canada. A crucial weapon that Putin’s Kremlin deployed in defanging the – albeit rickety and imperfect – democracy that grew up in Russia in the 1990s was his control of the press. No one has written about this better than Kyiv-born Peter Pomerantsev in Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible, a hilarious but terrifying account of his own career in the Russian media. Joshua Yaffa did a fantastic job of exploring how ordinary people navigated the system Putin built in Between Two Fires: Truth, Ambition and Compromise in Putin’s Russia. But the west is very much not guiltless in supporting the corrupt systems that have bedevilled both Russia and Ukraine (anger at which drove Kyiv’s 2014 revolution). To understand how kleptocracy is enabled out of western capitals, and, above all, out of London, read Kleptopia by Tom Burgis. The oligarchs from both sides employ western lawyers, accountants and wealth managers to hide the money they stole, then spend it on property, luxury goods, fine art and more. All of these books will help you understand where this crisis came from, but none of them will quite conjure up the profound shock that Ukrainians and Russians alike feel at the outbreak of war between their nations. There are many monuments to their shared culture, but my favourite is my collection of Nikolai Gogol’s short stories. Raised in Ukraine, discovered in Russia, adored in both, Gogol conjures up the absurdity of life under autocracy better than anyone. It is hard to spend time in Kyiv without falling in love with it. The location of the city, on a hill above the Dnieper, is extraordinary. And its residents, with their deep-rooted and apparently unconscious bilingualism, and their absurd sense of humour, have a unique culture all of their own. Only Kyiv would overthrow a kleptocrat, then put his vulgar swag on display in the art museum as immersive conceptual art. I don’t know of any book that perfectly captures the wonder of the Ukrainian capital, but Andrey Kurkov’s Death and the Penguin, a gloriously odd novel about a penguin employed to go to mafia funerals, first introduced me to it, and for that I adore it.

3/4/2022,"For almost two years, our lives have been dramatically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with millions of us changing the way we live, work and interact with each other on a daily basis. But now, as the last remaining Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted in England and Northern Ireland – with Scotland scheduled to follow – self-isolation for those with the virus is no longer a legal requirement. So, as we move towards the next stage of the pandemic, it’s still crucial to remain vigilant, taking care to protect our health and others. Behaviours that build protectionDespite the rules changing, vaccines and boosters remain our best defence against Covid-19, significantly reducing the risk of serious illness from the virus. Research shows that unvaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalised with the virus than those who have had both doses of the vaccine and a booster. Being vaccinated also means there’s a much smaller chance of developing long Covid, too. It’s still important to take up vaccinations and boosters if they are overdue – and to encourage loved ones to do the same, says GP Dr Thuva Amuthan. “Over the last few years, we have learned so much about coronavirus and have become very well informed of infection control precautions. It’s crucial we continue to follow these,” he adds. “Boosters allow our bodies to prepare a more robust and protective immune response, even against some variants, meaning your immune system is likely to be much better prepared,” he says. “Vaccinations have been very effective at reducing Covid-related hospitalisations and deaths. Studies have actually shown the risk of developing long Covid was reduced by approximately 50% in those who were double vaccinated.” Another GP, Dr Amina Ahmed, adds that it is important to remember that viruses can mutate and evolve. “These are called ‘strains’ and sometimes boosters will include small changes to teach the body to manage these strains,” she says. “The aim of Covid-19 vaccines is to minimise the growth of the virus when your body comes into contact with it, which prevents the spread of Covid because the body kills it. As the body can kill the virus more swiftly, the virus does not get the chance to do as much damage or cause long-term symptoms.” Behaviours when illEven with all restrictions ending, it doesn’t mean the virus has disappeared – and the reality is, many of us are still likely to become infected over the coming months. So it’s important we continue to recognise symptoms and adapt our behaviours where possible, even when it’s not a legal requirement. Symptoms of the virus can vary from person to person, but the main symptoms should still be easily recognisable, says Ahmed. “The main symptoms of Covid are a new and continuous cough – so coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours; a high temperature – feeling hot to the touch on your back or chest; and changes to your taste and sense of smell.” For anyone experiencing symptoms, make sure to minimise your contact with others – even though it is no longer a legal requirement. “This is because you may have the infection and these measures will prevent the infection spreading to others,” says Ahmed. “You should take these measures even if you are fully vaccinated because you are giving your body time to kill the virus and will not be spreading it while your body upscales its infection-fighting systems. If your test is positive, then follow government guidance, but take measures to prevent the spread, too.” Amuthan adds: “Just as you would if you had a cold or a stomach bug, it is vital we continue to practise stringent hygiene measures to avoid the spread of coronavirus. “Rest will not only help your body recover but also avoid spreading it to others. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water and eating well, too.” Always-on behavioursA major stumbling block around slowing the spread of Covid-19 has always been people who have the virus but show no symptoms at all, spreading the virus unintentionally. Without realising you have Covid-19, it’s very easy to infect others, which is why it’s so important to practise simple, helpful behaviours that stop the virus hanging around. The first is face coverings or masks, which are especially useful in enclosed public spaces. Wearing a face covering over your nose and mouth in an enclosed space helps stop the spread of the virus, since anyone with Covid-19 releases contagious droplets when they exhale, which spread quickly. “Wearing masks helps because if you have the infection, the mask keeps the droplets from spreading,” says Ahmed. “If you don’t have the infection, the mask will prevent you from inhaling airborne infected droplets, too.” Ventilation is incredibly important as well, since when indoors, coronavirus particles hang around in the air like smoke. Letting fresh air in when meeting indoors could be the difference between spreading the virus or not, since fresh air disperses Covid-19 particles. If an area is enclosed, all the individuals in that small space are likely to come into contact with contagious droplets, whether they are in the air or on surfaces,” says Ahmed. “Instead, we should meet in open spaces, or ensure indoor spaces are well-ventilated, so that infected droplets are dispersed widely and quickly, reducing the risk that we come into contact with them.” Even small actions such as opening windows for 10 minutes every hour when visitors are over, or letting fresh air into rooms before and after visits, helps dilute any virus particles. Likewise, leaving extractor fans running in bathrooms and kitchens can help spread fresh air around the home. The same advice applies to car-sharing, and in the workplace. Meeting outside where possible is not only helpful for our mental wellbeing but will also reduce the spread of coronavirus,” says Amuthan. “If you have coronavirus, it’s really important you follow these behaviours to reduce the spread as much as possible. Until enough of the world is vaccinated for us to develop herd immunity, we need to continue these practices to avoid further variant pandemics.” Regular handwashing is another habit well worth continuing, says Ahmed. “It is important to wash hands to prevent the spread if you are infected, but also to prevent the virus entering your body,” she says. “Washing your hands regularly will ensure infected droplets are washed off before they reach your mouth and nose. This is also why we advise people not to touch their face when their hands aren’t clean.” If you’re worried that some of your good habits are starting to slip, Ahmed suggests a creative approach to envision how the virus spreads: “Try imagining infected droplets as honey that sticks to whatever it touches,” she says. “An infected person will have honey on their hands and leave it in areas they touch, such as door handles, switches and so forth. Instead, prevent spreading it by washing your hands regularly. The idea for those not infected is to avoid getting that honey on their hands from these surfaces. And if you do, wash it off before honey ends up on your face.” For more information on how to stay safe as the Covid-19 rules change, visit gov.uk/coronavirus.
