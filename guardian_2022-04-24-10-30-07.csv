4/24/2022,"Sheryl Scharkie knows she isn’t the typical Elvis tribute artist. “Female Elvis tribute artists aren’t necessarily well-received,” she tells Guardian Australia. In fact she’s one of only two in the country. “Ten years ago, it was basically unheard of. It took a while for people to get used to me.” “The guys who hold the festivals and that, they don’t really know what to do with me. They don’t know if I can perform by myself or if I should just be an opener. I mean, I do three or four-hour shows,” she says, with the roll of an eye. “The other thing is that I can sing most of the boys out of the park.” She may be different, but Scharkie is doing just fine. Under her stage name of “ShElvis”, she was recently inducted into the International Elvis Tribute Artist Hall of Fame, and has twice placed in the top 10 of Elvis tribute artist competitions in Surfers Paradise. Today, though, she is playing outside a cafe, serenading the small but passionate legion of fans who follow her around Australia. Scharkie fields audience requests to sing classics like Hound Dog and He Touched Me, stopping after the set to take selfies and sign CDs. A selection of entrants who participated in Parkes’ Miss Priscilla contest. This is just one of 10 gigs she’ll play across five days for the Parkes Elvis festival, which for four days each year triples the population of a small regional town in central-west New South Wales. Parkes is a hallowed annual event for Elvis tribute artists (or ETAs, as they refer to themselves; many consider the term “impersonator” offensive, as it doesn’t capture the respect with which they try to embody the King). Australia doesn’t have a full Elvis circuit like the US, where ETAs can make a living off touring year-round. We have the Blue Mountains Elvis festival, a smaller wintertime affair, and in Coolangatta, there is a 50s festival called Cooly Rocks On, which the Elvii are slowly starting to infiltrate. But “Parkes is always going to be number one” Scharkie says. 2022 is her ninth year at the event. Sheryl ‘ShElvis’ Scharkie is a rare female Elvis tribute artist, who brought a small but passionate fanbase to her gigs at Parkes. The Parkes Elvis festival attracts around 25,000 visitors annually; accommodation in Parkes, along with the neighbouring towns of Forbes and Orange, books out months in advance. So too do tickets for the Elvis Express, a train that departs Sydney’s Central station packed with hundreds of costumed fans and a handful of tribute artists, who perform in the aisles of swaying carriages throughout the seven-hour journey. Many travel circuitous routes to Sydney instead of going direct to Parkes, just to be part of the ride. An unnamed Elvis on the Elvis Express. In Parkes, just about every venue in town gets into the spirit. Pubs, RSLs, bowling clubs and street corners are taken over by performers doing their best baritone. The local Vinnies dresses up its second-hand frames by stuffing them with photos of Elvis, and the bakery cinnamon dusts his image onto the top of custard tarts. The official program includes a main stage with live music from 9am-10pm daily, plus markets where you can pick up a chip-on-a-stick or a pamphlet for in-home aged care. The festival also facilitates events like the Miss Priscilla pageant, where local brunettes stroll the stage at the Services Club to be judged on who best resembles Presley’s wife; and the Ultimate Elvis Tribute Artist Competition, where tribute artists face off for the opportunity to progress to a global competition in Memphis. Unofficial events include Elvis karaoke, Elvis rugby and Elvis trivia. Emilio, a 22-year-old Elvis tribute artist, with local Rafa Thomson. It is a festival beloved by all who experience it, but the weekend really belongs to the tribute artists. And after a Covid-enforced hiatus last year, they are thrilled to have Parkes back. “We’ve all been dying for this,” Scharkie says. For tribute artist Lenard Connolly, the return of Parkes has brought particular relief. When he’s not singing The King, Connolly is a frontline healthcare worker. “This is my escape,” he says. Every tribute artist has their own origin story – the tale of how they discovered Elvis and eventually decided to zip up a jumpsuit of their own. For Wiradjuri, Yuin and Ngunnawal man Connolly, it was hearing Presley on his parent’s radio. Tribute artist Lenard Connolly on the Elvis Express. “I just thought, who’s this guy? I really liked the sound of his voice. Soon I was singing Elvis before I went to school. Just a little Aboriginal kid shaking his leg,” he says. But the road to becoming a professional tribute artist requires commitment. A custom-made Elvis suit – you can’t buy off the rack if you want it to fit properly – can cost upwards of $3,000. You’ll have to grow your sideburns and dye them black, or stick hair on where the real thing is missing. You’ll pay slavish attention to detail, ensuring even the rings you wear match the Elvis era you are replicating. Years are spent perfecting not just the vocals but the gyration of hips, the way Presley moved his eyebrows, the looks he’d throw the crowd. Elvis tribute artist Al Gersbech. “You’ve got to love him,” tribute artist Paul Fenech, the winner of this year’s Ultimate Elvis Competition, tells me. “You’ve got to have been watching him as you grew up. You’ve got to watch all the movies or put on a concert of his every night before you go out. If you’re not doing that, then you’re not really in it for the right reason. And I don’t think you will ever, ever grasp the real feel of Elvis.” Among tribute artists, the reverence for Elvis is real. “I believe he’s one of the most important human beings ever. Other than Jesus Christ,” Connolly says. While Connolly describes himself as “older than Elvis ever was” – a descriptor that could apply to most ETAs – there are a few at the other end of the age spectrum. One is Penrith’s Emilio Prince, a fast-rising 22-year-old tribute artist who wants to bring The King to people his age.

So festivals like this make it so much easier, because so many young people come with their families.” Prince takes his work seriously. Pre-Covid he was playing around six shows a month; under the guidance of a manager, he hopes to soon make this his full-time career. He knows he has a lot to learn from those who came before him. “There’s no jealousy … it’s all about supporting each other,” he says. “They teach me their tricks. They’ve been doing it for over 40 years so obviously you’re going to take that advice and you’re going to cherish it.” For tribute artists, it’s not just a community they are part of – but something greater. “We call it the Elvis world,” Connolly says. “And we live in it.” The Parkes Elvis festival closes on Sunday 24 April",Arts/Music,‘This is my escape’: scenes from the Elvis festival that takes over a small town,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/24/this-is-my-escape-scenes-from-the-elvis-festival-that-takes-over-a-small-town
4/24/2022,"And so in the end, there it was: the most famous smile in Spanish football. Late, very late on Saturday, Joaquín Sánchez lifted the Copa del Rey into the sky in Seville, his city, having become the only player in Real Betis’s history to win the competition for a second time. It took 17 years and two days but Betis have the third cup in their history and their captain has the perfect last dance. He was there when they won it in 2005, and he was there again last night, two months off his 41st birthday as a dramatic penalty shootout delivered his dream. This final, he had said, was a reward for 20 years of love for the game and it was hard not to love this moment, his moment. All of theirs. Hard too not to feel sad for Yunus Musah, whose missed penalty saw the trophy slip from Valencia’s grasp. Joaquín, who missed the vital spot-kick that put Spain out of the World Cup 20 long years ago, knows how that feels. He almost felt it again too, his own effort here just squeezing in at the post. He escaped, Musah didn’t, and at 12.50am Juan Miranda scored to spark wild scenes, people running across the pitch. He had also been there in 2005, last time Betis won this competition — as a fan, aged five. Manuel Pellegrini, too, had done it. After 63 years and having taken charge of almost 2,500 games between them, this was a first Copa del Rey final for both coaches, and the Chilean came dressed for the occasion. The stats showed that Betis win 63% of matches when he wears the club’s tracksuit, and only 39% when he doesn’t. So here he was, Kappa’d up on the touchline, celebrating at the start and at the very end. Only 10 minutes had passed when Nabil Fekir released Héctor Bellerín up the right, and he delivered the perfect cross for Borja Iglesias to rise and thump a header into the net. Another 110 more minutes would go by plus penalties before it was eventually done. Betis had control earlier than they could have imagined, Valencia uneasy when they were put under pressure. Mouctar Diakhaby in particular appeared a little lost in those opening minutes, although he would recover. He had already been caught in the middle of the pitch, unaware of the opponent behind him and he almost gifted Iglesias a second with a dreadful back-pass. This was an enjoyable opening and there were other chances, Juanmi heading wide from Álex Moreno’s cross before a lovely touch from Iglesias saw Bellerín dash deep into the Valencia area, where he was just unable to complete the cut-back. But then, suddenly, without warning, momentum shifted to José Bordalás’ team. The move was as superb as it was swift: Carlos Soler to Ilaix Moriba and on to Hugo Duro, sprinting clear right through the middle to lift a gorgeous, calm finish over Claudio Bravo. Betis had lost the lead and seemingly the game with it, the passing less crisp now, their dominion diminished, although Sergio Canales hit the post just before half-time. Emboldened, Valencia took a step forward that became even more determined as the second half began. Twice inside 10 minutes they should have added to the scoring. The first time, Duro turned over from close range after Bravo got a hand to José Luis Gayá’s pull back. The second a surging run from Dimitri Foulquier, made the space from which Soler and Gonçalo Guedes combined to create for Moriba. The ball dropped for him at the far post, asking to be hit but he almost missed it entirely, swiping at the volley. Warming up on the touchline, Joaquín appealed for Betis’ fans to get behind the team. If their relative quiet was understandable given the way this game had moved away from them, it was only temporary and soon they were taking the roof off again, hardly able to believe it when another exceptional touch from lglesias didn’t bring them the lead. His backheel went through the legs of the defender to Juanmi seven yards out, but Giorgi Mamardashvili saved, as he would do often. Canales then shot wide as the game swung back again, Iglesias especially active, before Juanmi hit the post. Valencia were forced ever further back, perhaps fortunate not to see Hugo Guillamón receive a second yellow. It was all about holding on now, although the threat on the break was always there. Iglesias shot over, having briefly paused to ask for a penalty – not entirely without reason – and William Carvalho smuggled the ball to Fekir, who was denied by Mamardashvili. He should have scored; with two minutes left, Valencia might have done, but Thierry Correia chose the wrong option when he was sent running through. That was just the start of a wild minute in which Iglesias drew yet another save from Mamardashvili at one end and Bryan Gil outran Bellerín in the middle of the pitch to set up what might have been a dramatic end. Guedes found Soler, the cup appearing in front of him – but Bravo doing so too. This was fun and there were going to be 30 minutes more. And the rest. Tense, tired, barely able to walk, it would come down to penalties, and the kind of ending that had been waiting a long time to be written.",Sport/Football,Joaquín joy as Real Betis beat Valencia on penalties to lift Copa del Rey,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/real-betis-valencia-copa-del-rey-final-match-report
