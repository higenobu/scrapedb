1/22/2022,"The Wiggles have taken the top spot in the Triple J Hottest 100 with their cover of Tame Impala’s 2012 song Elephant. The children’s performers had a viral hit in March when they transformed the track for Triple J’s cover series Like a Version, infusing it with the chorus from their song, Fruit Salad.  The group posted their delight at the victory on Twitter. We're so absolutely chuffed! Number 1 in @triplej's #Hottest100 in 2021! A big thank you to everyone who voted for us. We loved singing ""Elephant"" by @tameimpala and we're so glad you all loved it too! 💛💜💙❤🐘🎸 #TheWiggles pic.twitter.com/4tAF6GvCgY While it might seem like an unlikely victory, it’s not the first time a Like a Version cover has done well in the Hottest 100. As Shaad D’Souza points out, covers with novelty value often resonate with listers – DMA’s cover of Cher’s Believe got to No 6 in 2016 and Alex Lahey’s cover of a My Chemical Romance track went to No 83 in 2020. The Wiggles did, however, edge out the song that was widely tipped to win the annual poll. The Kid Laroi and Justin Bieber were favourites to win with their collaboration Stay, which has now hit No 1 on song charts in over 20 countries worldwide. Stay instead came in second place. Had Stay topped the poll, it would have made 18-year-old Kamilaroi rapper Laroi, who grew up in the Sydney suburb of Waterloo, the first ever First Nations artist to reach No 1 in the Hottest 100. Perth four-piece Spacey Jane placed at No 3 with their track Lots of Nothing, one of three songs they had featured in the countdown. Disney actor turned popstar Olivia Rodrigo was another of the big winners in this year’s poll. Her song Good 4 You placed at No 4 in the countdown, with a further four tracks from her debut album, Sour, also making the Hottest 100. Commercial pop acts Bieber and Rodrigo both placing in the top five is reflective of a shift in the station’s attitude towards mainstream pop music – in 2015, Taylor Swift’s track Shake It Off was banned from entry into the Hottest 100. Another pop favourite, Billie Eilish, who topped the poll two years ago and was the most played artist on Triple J in 2021, placed at No 5 with Happier Than Ever. Local acts like Rüfüs Du Sol, Lime Cordiale and Ocean Alley also each had multiple tracks in this year’s poll. Further down the poll, Genesis Owusu, who collected four Aria awards at last year’s ceremony for his acclaimed debut album Smiling With No Teeth, placed at No 75 with Gold Chains. Amyl and the Sniffers landed at No 28 with their track Hertz. The Hottest 100 wasn’t the only countdown under way on Saturday: on Twitter, the account @OzKitsch provided comic relief with its “Coldest 100”, which looked back on curious Australian music moments. In a nod to the Wiggles cracking this year’s Triple J poll, their countdown was topped by a 2014 video of the group performing a musical number about poppadoms. The Hottest 100 comes after another difficult year for Australia’s music industry. The pandemic forced the widespread cancellation of music festivals and live tours in 2021, costing thousands of industry professionals their livelihood and prompting some artists to find work elsewhere. The I Lost My Gig collective has estimated that since March 2020, the Australian live music sector has lost an average of $64m in income each month. More than 2.5m votes were submitted in this year’s Hottest 100. On Friday Triple J aired the Hottest 200, revealing the songs that placed from 200-101 in this year’s poll, with Sydney pop artist May-a placing at No 101 with her single Time I Love to Waste.",Arts/Music,Australian children’s group the Wiggles top Triple J Hottest 100,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/22/australian-childrens-group-the-wiggles-top-triple-j-hottest-100
1/22/2022,"With Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal conviction working its way toward an appeal, and Virginia Giuffre’s civil case against Prince Andrew caught up in arguments over evidence and depositions, another high-profile case linked to the convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein is working through the New York court system.  It too is dragging in some of the biggest names in elite New York society, in this case sending shockwaves through the rarefied world of Manhattan finance. Leon Black, one of New York’s wealthiest men with an estimated net worth of $13.2bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and formerly chief of Apollo Global Management and chairman of the Museum of Modern Art (Moma), is locked in a bitter dispute with Guzel Ganieva, a Russian model and former mistress who accused him of sexual violence and claims she was pressured by Black to engage in sex acts with Epstein. Over recent months, the dispute between Black, 70, and Ganieva has escalated with a series of back-and-forth lawsuits in which the accusations have grown ever more serious, and spiraled out to draw in figures from some of Manhattan’s most powerful social circles. Ganieva’s initial allegations of defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, gender-motivated violence and retaliation, were first revealed in tweets early last year, and followed revelations about $158m in payments Black made to Epstein for tax advice and financial services that precipitated his stepping down from Apollo and Moma. In June, Ganieva sued Black in New York state court, described above, claiming he forced her to sign a 2015 non-disclosure agreement about their six-and-a-half-year relationship, and had defamed her by claiming she tried to extort him by threatening to go public with their relationship. Lawyers for Black have said Ganieva’s lawsuit is “a work of fiction” and said he made payments only to secure her silence about their relationship. Black has said he refused Ganieva’s initial demand for $100m, but reached an agreement that in exchange for a confidentiality deal he would forgive $1m in loans and pay her $100,000 a month for 15 years. He also gave her $2.75m to help her obtain a British visa or passport. Now the dispute has become even more acrimonious. After Ganieva accused him of sexual abuse, Black did not merely reject Ganieva’s accusations or counter-sue in New York civil court – the same jurisdiction that she sued him – but filed a US federal lawsuit under conspiracy and racketeering statutes normally used for busting mobsters and drug traffickers. Ganieva’s complaints “are shams”, Black’s attorneys countered in the federal case, and though they said his relationship with Ganieva was “regrettable”, they said her claims were “fraudulently designed to mislead the New York state court and (more directly) to defame and bully Mr Black into adding to the extortionate payments he already has made to prevent Ms Ganieva from further destroying him”. In the lawsuit, Black claimed that Ganieva and her lawyers at Wigdor – a firm that has been at the forefront of civil settlements with men accused of sexual misconduct during the #MeToo era, such as the disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein – conspired with others to extort him and destroy his reputation. Black’s lawyers said in the complaint: “They waged war on multiple fronts and had multiple goals – among them, to get more money through extortion or a fraudulently induced litigation award; to destroy the reputation of Mr Black and his business; to undermine his career; to interfere with his business relationships; and to raise concerns about his leadership of the company he created and nurtured for the last 30 years.” Black’s attorney in the federal action is Susan Estrich, a legal scholar who became known as manager of Michael Dukakis’s 1988 presidential campaign and later defended the former Fox News executive Roger Ailes against claims of sexual harassment. In court papers, filed in Manhattan, Estrich has described Ganieva and her lawyers at Wigdor as perpetrators of a wide-ranging extortion scheme “to try to get even more from Mr Black – or destroy him in the process”. The defendants “duped and manipulated the media and the courts, using the mails and the wires, to orchestrate an assassination of Mr Black on every level”, according to Black’s lawyers. But Estrich has also alleged that the conspiracy includes unnamed co-conspirators or “John Does”, that include two “flacks”, or PR specialists, and a financial backer with deep pockets to “go head-to-head with a billionaire”. Black’s lawyers have also said they plan to find out who is paying Wigdor’s fees in Ganieva’s action against him. Ganieva has agreed to pay Wigdor 38% of any money she received from Black, according to an agreement letter filed in the case. Ganieva and Wigdor deny the claims against them. Wigdor filed a motion to dismiss, calling the action “frivolous as a matter of law” and arguing that “Black and his counsel know that there is no evidentiary support or good-faith basis for their contrived and defective ‘Rico’ [Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act] and ‘defamation’ claims.” Lawyers for the financier say an amended complaint will be filed in the coming days that will further expose the alleged conspiracy against Black. Recent court disclosures offer a clue to which direction that may be headed. Black’s lawyers have requested that the presiding judge allow them access to private records involving some of New York’s most prominent businessmen, including his partner at Apollo, Josh Harris, the owner of the Premier League football club Crystal Palace, who agitated for Black to step down after Black’s payments to Epstein were revealed. Jonathan Rosen, an attorney for Harris, described Black’s insinuations as “desperate and absurd” and denied any connection between Harris and Ganieva or her lawyers. “Mr Harris has nothing whatsoever to do with the deeply troubling situation Mr Black finds himself in, and any statement or implication otherwise is unhinged at best,” Rosen told the Guardian. Others included in Black’s Rico action are Steven Rubenstein, the New York public relations executive whose clients have included Rupert Murdoch, Bill Gates and Donald Trump; and Michael Rubin, a sports merchandise billionaire and co-owner, with Harris, of the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers. According to court documents, Black’s attorneys wanted to know of any contact that Rubenstein had with nine named individuals, including Ganieva, her attorneys and reporters. Rubenstein and Rubin have also objected to being dragged into the case. Rubenstein’s attorneys said in court filings that “any private citizen should be aghast that [a bystander to a lawsuit] could be made the subject of a subpoena calling for all their telephone records simply at the whim of a litigant.” Jeanne Christensen, a lawyer at Wigdor named in the action, believes that instead of filing a counter-claim in Ganieva’s original state court claim against the financier, Black had filed a new case in federal court that potentially moves faster. “He’s basically just trying to intimidate our client by filing a separate lawsuit against her,” Christensen told the Guardian. “It’s a tactic to cause potential division between her and her lawyers. He’s hitting her from as many sides as he can. It’s pretty bad.” Bennett Gershman, a former prosecutor in the New York state anti-corruption office who teaches law at Pace University, said he could not think of another civil sexual harassment case that has been returned in another court with a Rico complaint. “This is well beyond what you usually see,” Gershman told the Guardian. “I’ve never seen a litigant bring a Rico action against a woman who we thought had settled to the tune of a million dollars a year. It’s spinning out of control in terms of being personal, vindictive and inflammatory. US litigation is often adversarial and contentious, but this is well beyond that. They’re going at it tooth and nail.”",News/US news,"‘Personal, vindictive, inflammatory’: Epstein-linked legal battle ratchets up",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/22/new-york-leon-black-court-case-scandal
1/22/2022,"In February 2020, when the novelist and doctor Roopa Farooki first sat down to write her latest book, coronavirus was “something that was kind of buzzing around” in the background. “Those of us going to work every day in a hospital, we weren’t really aware of it; we were just blindly doing our job, day by day, patient by patient. Knowing there was this thing happening, but it was insidious. There was a clue here or there, but we weren’t absolutely sure how far it would affect us, or how far it would change us.”  Farooki’s sister Kiron had just died of breast cancer. Kiron was 48, a solicitor and a mother. She had previously been unwell, but the cancer had gone into remission. “We thought she had beaten this thing,” says Farooki. Her sister was straight-talking, fierce in her love, prone to doling out advice whether Farooki wanted to hear it or not. “She was super-amazing at everything she did.” To process it all, Farooki did what she has done since she was a little girl: she wrote about it. “Before she passed away, she saw that I was thinking about her and writing about it. She wasn’t angry about it. But you always worry when you write about someone that you’re twisting yourself into someone else’s tragedy.” Weeks later, buffeted by grief, Farooki would find herself working on the frontline of the Covid-19 pandemic, covering the acute medical ward in an A&E department at a hospital in the south-east of England. At night, bone-tired, she would come home, attempt to spend a few precious minutes with her four children, aged between nine and 14, and then type late into the night, frequently waking up with her head on the keyboard. The resulting memoir, Everything Is True: A Junior Doctor’s Story of Life, Death and Grief in a Time of Pandemic, is an attempt to make sense of a bewildering and frequently terrifying period in Farooki’s life, as the grief-stricken doctor grappled with the loss of her beloved sister and the realisation that she might become one of the 850 healthcare workers thought to have died in the first wave of the pandemic. Over Zoom, Farooki tells me she is exhausted, and possibly unwell, although she does not seem it, speaking in long, forceful bursts of high-tempo, uninterrupted speech. It is her first day off in a run of nine days, and she is worried she may be about to develop Covid symptoms: one of her colleagues recently tested positive, “so everyone on the ward is counting down to when they’re going to get symptoms again.” We speak as Britain is witnessing the start of a wave of Omicron infections: later, checking back in, Farooki tells me that her Trust is on the brink. “Bed availability for new admissions is compromised,” she says, “meaning that, in practice, there just isn’t the space, so patients who’ve been admitted may have to wait hours receiving treatment in a chair until someone else is discharged.” A disturbing number of patients have not been jabbed. “The only patients since the summer that I’ve had to admit for oxygen or treatment with Covid are the unvaccinated. Some were in their 20s and 30s and had freely passed the infection to their families.” Before retraining as a doctor in her 30s, Farooki authored eight books, writing her first novel, the well-reviewed Bitter Sweets, while she was pregnant with her first child and renovating a house in France. Her novels, which often examine complicated and shifting family dynamics, have won her comparisons to Monica Ali and Zadie Smith. She was nominated for the Women’s prize for fiction three times. But despite the critical acclaim, the life of a novelist wasn’t enough to sate Farooki’s ambitions. “I’ve actually always wanted to be a doctor,” she says. “It was just one of those things that wasn’t possible when I was younger.” She won a scholarship to a private girls’ school, but on the condition she chose arts subjects for her A-levels, which she was strongest at. “With those A-levels,” she explains, “you don’t go into medicine.” In 2014, she published what she thinks now might be her final novel, The Good Children. “It’s hard to think about writing novels at the moment. You need a lot of space and clarity to create and inhabit an imaginary world,” Farooki says. Her children were all in school, and suddenly medicine seemed a possibility. “I studied physics, biology and chemistry books I took out of the library for about three to six months,” she says proudly, “and I sat the graduate entry exam for medicine. And with that I could go to medical school. It was that straightforward.” Everything Is True is written in a fragmented style, with snippets of imagined conversations with Kiron interspersed with details of the patients Farooki treats and the occasionally fraught conversations she has with her husband, who is concerned she will bring a deadly virus into their home. At times, the stoical medical professional is undone by the horror she witnesses. “Death is all around,” she writes as the toll passes 40,000. “It’s everywhere, and the air is constantly crackling with the expired electricity of it. The sound of breaking hearts is deafening.” The memoir covers the first 40 days of lockdown. While the public sat at home, baking and Zooming, “we all marched into hospital and kept going”, says Farooki, “day after day”. She wrote Everything Is True for an imagined “future self who wouldn’t believe this had happened. I thought I was writing it for someone who would have forgotten all these terrible things, like you forget things that are tragic. Like you forget the pain of childbirth. To remind me that these terrible times happened, because it’s important to take account and to bear witness to this.” She never intended for it to be published. “It was a cathartic outpouring,” she says. “I was writing it for me. I started writing about Kiron and it just unleashed itself, like a flood around me. And I found some comfort in trying to make sense of the insanity of the day. To try and put it in some kind of form.” More than anything, Everything Is True is an attempt to elude the smoothing passage of time. “I was afraid we would forget,” she says. “Forget what this felt like. And forget to hold those accountable. And [I was] holding myself accountable as well in some way. To say: ‘This was an extraordinary time and this is what I did. Did I do enough? I don’t know.’” In the book, Farooki writes of being exposed to Covid-19 repeatedly when admitting patients to the acute medical ward. “You’ll soak it [the virus] up in your hair like a sponge,” she writes. “You’re going to get it, too. It’s inevitable.” The PPE provided is inadequate. “What was considered the appropriate PPE,” she says, “was always based on what was available … it was certainly not fully safe.” Staff secretly stashed scrubs in their lockers, as there weren’t enough to go round, and joked about whether their colleagues would save ventilators for them should they sicken. Inevitably, Farooki fell ill with Covid-19, even discussing her funeral plans with her sons in the event of her death. “I remember being kind of annoyed and hugely relieved at how normalised it had been for them,” she says. “They could say: ‘OK, Mum, if you want to talk about your funeral, what kind of cake do you want? Let’s get it right.’ I was thinking: ‘Oh my God, you’re monsters,’ but I was also thinking: ‘This is what the pandemic has done for us – we can actually accept and talk about death.” Farooki rejects the hackneyed battle metaphors so overused by politicians throughout the pandemic, and the corollary sentiment that the public should somehow accept doctors and nurses dying while executing their duties. “We’re not soldiers,” she says. “We signed up to care for people. This is all we signed up for. [The government] felt like they could take advantage of the fact that no one would ever not go in or not look after their patients … so the whole narrative about the bravery – we weren’t brave. We didn’t do it with any particular consent or decision-making. We were just put in that position because of the career we’ve chosen, because we’re in a caring profession, because we would never let someone deteriorate and die if we could do something about it.” She found the weekly clap for the NHS a performative, futile gesture. “It meant nothing,” she says. “It felt like it was a way to pretend that you were doing something, without actually having to do anything concrete. It felt like someone rewearing last year’s poppy. It was symbolic just for the person doing that, but it didn’t actually mean anything for the person who was on the receiving end.” What stands out from reading Everything Is True is how flattening the portrayal of NHS staff as heroic, willing lambs to the slaughter truly is. Farooki writes about how some doctors faked illness to avoid working on the most dangerous wards, and others contemplated leaving the profession entirely. A continual theme is the doctors’ anger at being forced to work for weeks without a day off, while their managers protect their own leave. “There was a point where it just felt that we were relentlessly being told that it had to be all hands on deck, and there wasn’t really informed consent about it,” she says. Farooki remembers one particularly strung-out colleague. “She said: ‘I didn’t even want to come in today. I just wanted to resign.’ There was this sense of unbearable fatigue.” She is also unflinching when it comes to documenting the strain Covid puts on her relationship. “Your children’s father is scared of you … He barks: ‘You’re putting our lives at risk,’” she writes. She recounts how Kiron told her that she thought they should separate, before she died. Are they still married? “We’re still together,” she says. “We have our four children. And I will say this: it was a very, very difficult time for everyone … we’ve all had times where relationships were absolutely pushed to breaking point, going through all of this.” Everything Is True is at its most affecting when Farooki writes about the patients she couldn’t save. Not all of them died of Covid; she is at pains to emphasise the hidden victims of the pandemic, from the person who wasn’t able to be assessed for a life-saving liver transplant to the elderly woman who stayed away from hospital for fear of burdening the NHS, until it was too late for doctors to save her. “This is how Covid was taking people from us, because of not being able to provide them the care they needed,” Farooki says. Farooki describes herself as “not generally political”, though she expresses frustration at the mishandling of the pandemic and the government’s sluggish response to unfolding events in Italy and China. “It’s a story of poor communication and mismanagement,” she says, “and the people who did actually have information, not doing enough and not doing it in a timely way.” She is alarmed by the fact that, more than a year on, it does not appear that politicians have learned their lesson. “There are still learnings that are not being put into action,” Farooki says. “We are still not learning about how to communicate the risk, how to effectively care for each other, about something even as straightforward as acknowledging the increased risk to people of BAME origin.” Although Farooki spent most of the first wave of the pandemic in a haze of exhaustion and overwork, one news story did cut through: that of Boris Johnson’s admission to intensive care. “I don’t want to criticise whatever decision the physicians in charge of his care made … but in my very limited experience of working in ITU, you would not have taken that bed from someone if it was just for oxygen,” she says. “You can provide that in most wards in the hospital. I felt that it was another example of something feeling unfair, I think. Of there being one rule for them and another rule for us.” She wrote Everything Is True in the sincere belief that, by the time it was published, the pandemic would have receded from UK shores. Nearly two years on, that seems like a touchingly naive hope. “It’s quite hard to think about,” says Farooki. “But it’s not really over. I still have colleagues literally a few days ago who are PCR positive. My daughter was PCR positive. There are new variants. You don’t know whether it will ever actually be over. So we live still with the possibility of death.”  Everything Is True by Roopa Farooki is published by Bloomsbury.",Arts/Books,‘The clap for the NHS meant nothing’: novelist turned doctor Roopa Farooki on her frontline experience of Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/22/the-clap-for-the-nhs-meant-nothing-novelist-turned-doctor-roopa-farooki-on-her-frontline-experience-of-covid
1/22/2022,"It was not meant to fall apart as fast as this. After Boris Johnson won the general election in December 2019, he declared in a victory address: “I, and we, will never take your support for granted.” The prime minister’s 80-seat majority, a victory for the “get Brexit done” campaign, appeared to leave him impregnable. For 18 months after, Johnson continued to defy political gravity despite repeated missteps, as the pandemic came to Britain’s shores.  “Johnson eyes decade in power,” splashed the Times in May after the Conservatives routed Labour in the Hartlepool byelection, a seat held by Labour for 47 years, with a swing of 16 points. “Jabs, jabs, jabs to jobs, jobs, jobs,” Johnson said, optimistic that a talent for soundbites could amount to a delivery programme for government. Less than four months ago, the Conservatives were again riding high at their party conference in Manchester. Johnson delivered a policy-light, joke-heavy speech on 6 October – this was “politics as light entertainment” said the Guardian sketch writer John Crace. The government’s wildlife plans were described as “build back beaver”; renewing UK beef imports to the US as “build back burger”. The moment it turned is clear: November’s misguided attempt to overturn the punishment for Owen Paterson, after the Tory MP was found to have breached parliament’s longstanding ban against paid lobbying. His case was taken up by a group of his Brexiter allies. Johnson backed it, the vote in parliament was won – and the argument in the country immediately lost. “Shameless MPs sink back into sleaze,” splashed the Daily Mail. “That is not what we do in this country, it’s what they do in Russia,” the Labour MP Chris Bryant said. Labour refused to work with the Tory proposals and the Paterson plan had to be embarrassingly withdrawn. Johnson blamed colleagues afterwards – he had been led to believe there would be cross-party support for the plan. “It was put to me by colleagues,” he later sheepishly told MPs. At first the return of sleaze allowed journalists to write broadly about Tory MPs’ second jobs, including the near £6m earned by the barrister and MP Geoffrey Cox. Labour started to tick ahead while Johnson’s jokey touch deserted him in a rambling speech about Peppa Pig World – “my kind of place” – to the CBI conference. It got close to home in December. A Daily Mirror story about Johnson and Downing Street staff attending Christmas parties a year earlier, when London was under Covid restrictions, led to a drip-drip of revelations. But this time it was about the conduct not of other Tory MPs but of Johnson himself and the No 10 he ran. “All guidance was followed,” Johnson said. Downing Street even tried to deny parties took place. That was utterly undermined by the emergence of a video showing the former press secretary Allegra Stratton joking about “a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night”. A tearful Stratton quit the next day. Voters with their own very different memories of lockdown were already unimpressed. Paterson had been forced to resign and his North Shropshire seat, normally one of the Conservatives’ safest, fell to the Lib Dems on a 34-point swing. “Boris Johnson, the party is over,” the winning candidate Helen Morgan declared – except that it wasn’t. Days later the Guardian published a picture of the prime minister having wine and cheese with his wife and staff in the Downing Street garden on 15 May 2020, the tail-end of the first lockdown. It was a work meeting, No 10 said, but the public reached their own conclusions. Johnson limped on to Christmas, while Sue Gray, the civil servant tasked with investigating, had an expanding list of parties to look at. There was little respite in January as the focus concentrated on the prime minister. Lord Geidt, his ethics adviser, concluded Johnson had acted unwisely in failing to disclose a WhatsApp exchange the prime minister had with Tory donor Lord Brownlow, who provided £58,000 of the cost of refurbishing the Downing Street flat. Johnson had previously said he did not know where the money came from and says he thought Brownlow was organising, not providing, funds. The message showed him asking the donor for the cash because the flat was “a bit of a tip”. Giving a “humble and sincere” apology, Johnson said he “did not recall” the begging message because it was contained on an old phone. Next came the email. “Please join us from 6pm and bring your own booze!” wrote Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, as he invited staff to an event on 20 May 2020 in a missive obtained by ITV News. Within minutes journalists were reporting Johnson himself was there. After a day in hiding Johnson apologised, although he still argued he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. While people around the country had been fined for breaching lockdown, discipline at Downing Street appeared nonexistent. Two drinks parties were held on 16 April 2021, the night before Prince Philip’s funeral, where the mourning Queen had stood alone. Johnson wasn’t present this time but staff had slipped off to the Co-op on the Strand armed with a suitcase to stuff full with bottles of wine, it was said. Even Johnson gave the impression he could not take much more, admitting he had to apologise to the monarch, and staring downcast with bloodshot eyes in an excruciating 16-minute Sky News interview. “Nobody told me that what we were doing was, as you say, against the rules,” Johnson said, although it was he who had been setting them for the country. The problems have mounted at a time when the cost of living is rising by 5.4% and energy bills are soaring. The current count of Downing Street lockdown-breaching parties stands at 15, but there is still a belief at Westminster there are more to emerge. Gray’s inquiry is yet to report and parts of the Conservative party are in open revolt, with dozens of letters of no confidence sent in by disgruntled MPs. But overriding all is the damage to Johnson’s reputation from the misjudged manoeuvres, evasive answers and revised declarations. “The public connected with Johnson on an emotional level like no other politician before,” said Martin Boon, a founder of polling firm Deltapoll. “Quite simply, he has taken a machete to that.”",News/Politics,From conference highs to the abyss: the swift undoing of Boris Johnson,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/22/from-conference-highs-to-the-abyss-the-swift-undoing-of-boris-johnson
1/22/2022,"Juuso Westerlund was passing his family bathroom when he noticed his youngest son, Antero, had climbed up on to the toilet seat. The six-year-old had just finished his evening bath; he didn’t notice his father in the doorway. As the boy studied his body in the steam-clouded mirror, the Finnish photographer snapped a silent photo. It would later become part of his Heartbeats collection, which is being exhibited at the Latvian Museum of Photography, in Riga. “The collection is the story of my boys,” Westerlund says. “The photographs are like love poems to my sons.”  Westerlund says he wouldn’t have dreamed of putting away, or later editing out, the half-empty handwash bottle or unplugged toothbrush charger. “I’d never stage a photo like this, and I’d never tidy up the space,” he says. “The world is filled with pictures of kids, and I don’t want mine to be polished or perfect. I just want to capture everyday moments and their special magic.” Westerlund always asks Antero, and his elder son, Erkki, permission to share pictures of them, but says they have become less interested in his exhibitions as the years have passed (Antero is now 10). This doesn’t bother him: “They’re my memories, not theirs,” he says. He does, however, hope they will treasure them once they reach adulthood. Reflecting on the photo five years after it was taken, Westerlund is struck by how sincere his son looks. “I’m not a big man, so it’s not that he’s comparing himself to me. Instead, he is asking himself: how do I look today? How do I appear to other people?”",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I want to capture everyday moments and their special magic’: Juuso Westerlund’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/22/i-want-to-capture-everyday-moments-and-their-special-magic-juuso-westerlunds-best-phone-picture
1/22/2022,"Just to the south of London’s great stations for the north – Euston, St Pancras and King’s Cross – an old and rather careworn neighbourhood serves the traveller’s needs. Cheap beds, cheap food and drink, drugs probably, sex formerly. Finer amusements had been planned for the site: in 1830 a project known as the Royal Panharmonium Pleasure Gardens, which was to include a theatre, ballroom and music gallery, went bankrupt before it was finished. In its place came a square and a few streets of modest brown-brick houses, built just before flat-fronted Georgian went out of fashion. Knowing no better, I stayed in a comfortless room there on a winter’s night in the 1960s. Shillings fed the meter for the gas fire, a light bulb hung from the ceiling, and in the early hours of the morning the door shook with a tremendous banging as a man’s slurred voice called out for a woman. The area is more respectable now, but in some ways nicely unchanged. True, there’s a Travelodge and a Comfort Inn, but also a Macdonald hotel and a Jesmond Dene hotel, which speak of a time when travellers coming or going from stations north of the Tyne liked to be reminded of home.  Thomas Morris and his wife Eileen (nee Shakespeare) moved to the district just before the second world war. Morris was a Londoner of Welsh ancestry, whose father had migrated from rural Cardiganshire and set up shop as a grocer and dairyman in the East End somewhere around 1900: a typical story of a time when Welsh migrants were estimated to own half the dairies in London. His wife died soon after Thomas was born in 1908. Father and son went on living together in Hackney until 1934, when Thomas married Eileen, daughter of a printworks compositor. He and his bride moved first to the set of parallel streets in north London known as the Harringay Ladder, and then to Birkenhead Street and its fine view north to the facade of King’s Cross station and the occasional drift of steam and smoke escaping through its arched roof. Their daughter Gillian was born here in 1939, with her father’s occupation described as “motor lorry driver” in the register. But he got on. He became a car salesman for an Austin dealership, joined the Conservative party, won a seat on St Pancras council and eventually served a year as its mayor, by which time the family had moved a few hundred yards from Birkenhead Street to a flat in Queen Alexandra Mansions, a giant slab of Edwardian red brick behind St Pancras town hall. The car showroom was only 10 minutes’ walk away, the council chamber lay just across the street, and, when the time came, Gillian found a job around the corner in Gray’s Inn Road in the offices of the Sunday Times. She was hired as a secretary to the city editor, William Rees-Mogg. Their subsequent courtship was prompted by his colleague, the writer Hunter Davies, who tipped him off that she was threatening to quit; he was so absorbed by the gold standard that she might as well not have existed. (In his written account, Davies said: “Hey, have you heard about Gillian? She is going to leave.” “Who?” “Your blooming secretary, that’s who! You have missed your chance there, William.”) And out of this happenstance came a long and happy marriage and five children, the fourth of them christened Jacob William. So far as I can tell, the leader of the House of Commons and lord president of the council rarely mentions this side of his ancestry. Not, I suspect, because he’s ashamed of it – a lorry driver’s rise to town mayor perfectly illustrates the Tory faith in individual enterprise – but because it doesn’t fit the caricature he has made of himself. The top hat, the tailcoat, the waistcoat, the striped trousers, the white tie, the six elaborately named children (one of them Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius), the drawl, the languor: matched with a grandad who drove a lorry, such a creation becomes a pitiable mountebank, Alfred Doolittle dressed for a wedding, rather than the courtly eccentric, the “honourable member for the 18th century”, which is how Rees-Mogg likes to present himself. His paternal forebears are a greater support, having lived in large stone houses that, though no longer in Rees-Mogg ownership, still stand and bear names. The manor at Farrington Gurney, Cholwell House at Temple Cloud, Ston Easton Park (“exceptionally sumptuous” – Nikolaus Pevsner) near Bath – a train of Somerset dwellings that began in the 17th century, to be joined by a second train of a similar kind when in 2007 Jacob married Helena de Chair, the daughter of Somerset de Chair and his fourth wife Lady Juliet Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, previously the Marchioness of Bristol. He is said to have proposed at Lady Juliet’s country house under one of its six Van Dycks. The weight of all this social connection and genealogy – the coats of arms, the Latin mottos, the drinks trolley – might weaken the mind of most of us, like a blow to the head with a Debrett’s Guide. Rees-Mogg, despite his enthusiastic immersion in it, remains as sharp as a tack. His assets include a £5m house in Westminster and the freehold of a building in Pall Mall, reported to be worth £4m. In 2020 his dividend from Somerset Capital Management, the investment firm he co-founded, came to £800,000 (last year he’s thought to have made £200,000 less). He has a London flat. When in Somerset he and his family live at Gournay Court, a 17th-century house that was restored and enlarged by King George V as a home for his epileptic youngest son, Prince John, who died before it was ready. A household presence is his old nanny, Veronica Crook, now nanny to his children; the same nanny that he took canvassing with him when he contested the former mining constituency of Central Fife in the 1997 election, perhaps in a misplaced attempt to be lovable or, more probable, to be noticed. We met once, at a village hustings in North East Somerset during the 2010 election campaign. A predictable sentiment follows: he was charming. But onstage I notice he said something twice for emphasis: you don’t make the poor rich by making the rich poor. Nobody in the audience looked particularly rich but there were sounds of agreement. With 41.3% of the vote, he took the seat from Labour and went on increasing his majority with a 49.8% share in 2015 and 53.6% in 2017, dropping only 3.2 percentage points in 2019. And during these years he praised Donald Trump (“our greatest ally after Brexit”), questioned the effects of climate change, suggested that his party should collaborate with Ukip, praised Nigel Farage, fought for the hardest of Brexits, and doubted the “common sense” of the victims of the Grenfell fire. The people of North East Somerset seem to like him. This week, walking around the streets of King’s Cross to see where his grandparents had lived, I began to hum the old music hall song: “I’m Burlington Bertie, I rise at ten thirty / And saunter along like a toff / I walk down the Strand with my gloves on my hand / Then I walk down again with them off …” The male-impersonator Ella Shields made the song popular towards the end of the first world war. Like Rees-Mogg, she favoured a top hat and tails while performing – a swell’s outfit and a disguise.
