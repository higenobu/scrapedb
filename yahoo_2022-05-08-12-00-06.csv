5/8/2022,"Aerial footage released by the Ukrainian military on May 7 shows strikes on a vessel and a structure on Snake Island in the Black Sea, which had been occupied by Russian forces since late February. Snake Island, or Zmiinyi Island, became a symbol of Ukrainian resistance to Russian aggression when, on the first day on the invasion, a viral audio recording depicted a Ukrainian soldier stationed on the island replying with an expletive as the crew of a Russian warship warned Ukrainians to surrender. The Ukrainian defense ministry said strikes carried out by a Bayraktar TB2 drone hit one of Russia’s Serna-class high-speed landing craft and two “Thor” anti-aircraft missile systems. The footage was released on May 7 by the Ukrainian military’s Operational Command South on May 7, but the date of the strikes has not been independently verified.
