1/20/2022,"The government should adopt a programme of “helicopter money” to support households hit by escalating energy bills, according to a leading thinktank with Labour and Tory MPs on its advisory board. The Social Market Foundation (SMF) said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, should support millions of low- and middle-income households through the cost of living crisis with a simple programme of US-style one-off cash payments worth £8.5bn. The proposal comes two weeks before the energy regulator, Ofgem, announces a rise of as much as £500 on the annual price cap on energy bills from April.  In a blog written by the SMF chief economist, Dr Aveek Bhattacharya, the thinktank urged Sunak to reject the overcomplicated solutions being put forward by the energy industry that would encourage people to use more energy and prop up ailing suppliers. Bhattacharya said a cheque for £300 should be sent to households that did not have a higher rate taxpayer, with an additional £200 for those on universal credit or legacy benefits, helping those who rely on the basic state pension or disability benefits. He said: “An emergency cash payment would also have the benefit of being a clear one-off intervention, whereas other proposals would risk committing the government to costly ongoing subsidies, that it would find politically difficult to end.” When the pandemic hit in 2020 the Trump administration in the US rejected mechanisms to subsidise workers through a furlough scheme or welfare benefits, preferring a system of oneoff cash payments, described as “helicopter money”, to taxpayers on low and middle incomes. Bhattacharya suggested the payments could be styled “Rishi’s cola (cost of living assistance)” and bear the chancellor’s signature. The proposal follows calls from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, for an “immediate emergency payment for people on the lowest incomes” to help them through the coming months. Sunak is known to be considering a deal with energy companies to reduce the price cap to prevent inflation from escalating in April. A loan of as much as £20bn would be needed to maintain bills near current levels, according to energy industry leaders. Inflation rose to 5.4% in December and, according to the Bank of England, will reach 6% in April when the energy cap is raised. Bhattacharya said that by staggering the payments over several months “any contribution to rising inflation can be minimised, and potentially avoided”.

1/20/2022,"When a blizzard struck Toronto earlier this week, Greg Cooke did what he and his neighbours knew was expected of them. They grabbed their shovels and worked for hours to clear the sidewalks from snowdrifts that nearly reached their knees. Mindful of elderly residents with trouble walking, they made sure to clear all the way to the edge of the street. The next morning, Cooke went outside to find a snowplow had passed through once again to widen the road and pushed all the snow back on to the sidewalk.  “They push up these solid, chunky boulders of snow. And so it was even worse for people to pass through than it would have been if we hadn’t done anything,” said Cooke. “It was comically absurd.” Yesterday at noon. Did my civic duty. The road had been plowed, emergency vehicles could get through, cars were fine once they got out of driveways. Today? Plows made sidewalks impassable. Drivers are pampered, pedestrians get nothing.@gordperks #TOpoli pic.twitter.com/Pt9ssGHtaS Monday’s storm battered the country’s largest city for less than a day, but its effects have nonetheless highlighted Toronto’s infrastructure vulnerabilities, its lingering inequities – and its dependence on cars. While the city’s struggles with snow have often prompted sneers from other regions of the country – Toronto’s government is still mocked for calling in the army to help dig it out from a series of relentless snowfalls in 1999 – critics say many of the challenges are the result of policy failures that prioritize vehicles over pedestrians. At its peak, Monday’s blizzard left hundreds of cars stranded on roads and highways across the city, with many of the vehicles simply abandoned by frustrated drivers The city’s transit commission said during the worst of the storm, 540 buses were stranded on the road for hours – including one salvaged by a group of Torontonians – and the subway system was forced to shut down. The city’s mayor, John Tory, warned on Tuesday that it would take days to get the roads fully cleared, and 600 road plows, 360 sidewalk plows and 200 salt trucks were deployed. But on Wednesday, residents were still posting images of sidewalks and bike lanes fully covered in snow. Meanwhile, the city’s school board announced eight schools would remained closed for a third day after the contractor hired to remove snow was unable to complete the work. “The last couple days have highlighted how close to failure our transportation system operates all the time – because we base it around cars,” said Shoshanna Saxe, a civil engineering professor at the University of Toronto. “For those of us who had the privilege of not needing to drive anywhere, it was a fun day in the snow. But for people who needed to drive, they were forced to take risks. Some were stranded for hours on highways. Doctors and nurses had to abandon their cars in the road to get to hospitals in the middle of the biggest wave of Covid we’ve ever seen,” she said. Saxes pointed to recent efforts in Sweden, where sidewalk clearing is prioritized ahead of roads. The aim of policies is to address systematic shortcomings that have an outsized effect on people with mobility issues, including those in wheelchairs, health issues and parents pushing small children in strollers. “When you decide not to plow a certain neighbourhood for a few days, you’re also now limiting the ability for someone with a disability to actually leave their home,” said Maayan Ziv, a Toronto-based photographer and founder of AccessNow. “Accessibility, in general, is often an afterthought.” Because she relies on a power wheelchair to move around the city, Ziv says the snow often forces her to cancel meetings and appointments and can strand her at home for days. Toronto city council recently approved nearly C$1.4bn ($US1.1bn) in spending on future snow clearing – a victory for residents who have long complained that sidewalks are inaccessible. But the winning bidders in the contract have warned it could take more than a year to obtain the hundreds of vehicles needed to do the job. “We live in this cold part of the world where it does snow every year, and yet, we’re still facing these issues. And when the city is failing to recognize those needs, it falls in on kind of the goodwill of neighbours,” said Ziv. “There is beauty in that and people working together and supporting each other. But an entire city can’t – and shouldn’t – rely on good Samaritans with their shovels”",News/Weather,Toronto’s struggles with blizzard highlights its dependence on cars,https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2022/jan/20/toronto-struggles-blizzard-dependence-cars
1/20/2022,"The team behind Disney+’s highly anticipated drama about Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee have revealed there was pushback about one possibly controversial scene. According to the show’s makers, a scene featuring Sebastian Stan (who plays Lee) having a conversation with an animatronic version of his own genitals initially baffled the network who commissioned the programme. “There was gentle pushback, because you’ve got to push back a little when a talking penis is presented to you. But Hulu was extremely supportive,” writer Robert Siegel told Variety, of the network who produced the show, before Disney+ decided to bring it to the UK.  Siegel says the scene was not his own invention, but hails from Lee’s autobiography, Tommyland. “As much as I’d like to take credit for that, I was simply adapting a chapter from [Lee’s] memoir,” says Siegel. “I think it might be a first [for television].” Pam & Tommy tells the tale of Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee’s infamous 90s sex tape, which became publicly available after it was stolen from a safe in their house. Starring alongside Stan is one-time Downton Abbey star Lily James as the ex-Baywatch actor. It is based on a 2014 Rolling Stone article, Pam and Tommy: The Untold Story of the World’s Most Infamous Sex Tape, which details how, once they discovered the tape was missing, they tried to contain the leak. Shooting the scene involved a team of specialist technicians, responsible for bringing the replica genitals to life. “You’ve got four puppeteers working with an animatronic penis,” commented director and executive producer Craig Gillespie, who described the shooting process as “just awkward”. The programme was created without involvement from the real-life celebrities who inspired it, with Anderson not responding to the show’s attempts to contact her. “She’s chosen not to engage,” says Siegel. “So we’ve respected her desire not to be involved.” Her friend Courtney Love has previously commented on the show’s production, however. In May, she wrote a now-deleted Facebook post stating that the sex tape was a “form of sexual assault”, being highly critical of Pam & Tommy for revisiting the incident. “My heart goes out to Pammy, further causing her complex trauma,” Love wrote. According to Stan, Lee had a slightly warmer reaction, being “touched and appreciative that I took the time to even reach out and connect”. However, he didn’t want to become formally associated with the project. The contentious scene appears in the second of the series’ eight-episode run. The genitals are voiced by actor Jason Mantzoukas, whose credits include playing The Good Place’s Derek and Adrian Pimento in Brooklyn Nine-Nine.",Arts/Television & radio,‘There was pushback’: Pam & Tommy makers open up about show’s animatronic talking penis scene,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/20/there-was-pushback-pam-and-tommy-makers-on-talking-penis-scene
1/20/2022,"There have been signs of a growing return to office working in London, with 8% more journeys recorded on the London underground network compared with a week ago. The increase came after the government ended work-from-home guidance immediately on Wednesday afternoon, with Sajid Javid claiming the Omicron coronavirus variant was “in retreat”, despite the number of new infections running at more than 100,000 a day.  Transport for London said 1.09m entry and exit “taps” with contactless cards or Oyster were recorded up to 10am on Thursday on the tube – about 80,000 more than last Thursday’s morning peak. Bus journeys were up 3% week on week, with 1.19m boarding taps recorded this morning. There had already been signs of growing weekday journeys in London throughout the month, with total tube journeys throughout Wednesday up 4% week-on-week – despite the partial closure of the Bank branch of the Northern Line, a vital commuter line serving the City. A four-month closure to complete the upgrade of Bank underground station started on Sunday. Bus journeys were likewise up 2% on Wednesday. No data was yet available from railways, although anecdotally operators said they had not seen significant signs of an uplift. Trains in particular were hit hard by the reimposition of work-from-home guidance in December, in response to the spread of the Omicron variant. Journey numbers had reached 70% of pre-pandemic levels in November, but fell to below 40% in January, with services affected by staff absences as well as people working from home. Latest provisional numbers showed just over 50% of passengers on trains overall, at the start of this week. The ending of work-from-home guidance will be followed next week by the lifting of rules making face masks mandatory on public transport from next Thursday. The change was welcomed by the Rail Delivery Group, with some in the industry saying the Covid regulations deterred passengers by implying trains were less safe than other environments. Nevertheless, user groups said removing masks would make many passengers feel less safe.

1/20/2022,"The company co-producing Tom Cruise’s forthcoming space film has unveiled plans for a film production studio and a sports arena in zero gravity. Space Entertainment Enterprise (SEE) has said their planned completion date is December 2024 for the module, named SEE-1, which will dock on Axiom Station, the commercial wing of the International Space Station (ISS).  The site will host films, television, music and sports events – although on-site audience capacity is yet to be determined – as well as content creators who want to develop, produce, record, broadcast and livestream 250 miles above Earth. Third-party providers will be able to use the facilities, but SEE also intends to make its own content. Axiom Station will then separate from the ISS in 2028. Axiom won the contract to develop the commercial wing earlier this month. “SEE-1 is an incredible opportunity for humanity to move into a different realm and start an exciting new chapter in space,” said SEE co-founders Dmitry and Elena Lesnevsky. “It will provide a unique and accessible home for boundless entertainment possibilities in a venue packed with innovative infrastructure, which will unleash a new world of creativity. “With worldwide leader Axiom Space building this cutting-edge, revolutionary facility, SEE-1 will provide not only the first, but also the supreme quality space structure enabling the expansion of the two trillion-dollar global entertainment industry into low-Earth orbit.” Axiom is the company that intends to send Tom Cruise and director Doug Liman to the International Space Station this year to shoot what will now be the second movie to be shot in space. Cruise had been planning to jet off in October 2021, but the trip was put back a few months for reasons reportedly relating to the $200m budget. Meanwhile, a Russian film crew successfully flew to the ISS earlier in October for a 12-day shoot on The Challenge. That film, about a surgeon who has to operate on a sick cosmonaut in space because his medical condition prevents him from returning to Earth to be treated, is scheduled for release later this year. Although documentaries featuring footage filmed by astronauts are now common – and live, global television broadcasting took a giant leap forward with the Apollo moon landings – only modest attempts have been made to film fiction beyond the final frontier. Despite films set in space being a staple of the industry, logistical and financial barriers meant the heavy lifting was done by creative prop departments and special effects teams to help audiences suspend their disbelief. A seven-minute short called Apogee of Fear was made in 2008 by space tourist Richard Garriott, featuring acting debuts by various baffled astronauts Some scenes from 1984 Soviet film Return from Orbit were also shot in space. Recent attempts to re-create zero gravity – and the claustrophobia – of space have paid dividends for mainstream film-makers. Years of research and effort and million-dollar innovations were behind the verisimilitude of Sandra Bullock and George Clooney’s weightlessness – and inter-orbit freefalls – in Alfonso Cuarón’s 2013 film Gravity.

1/20/2022,"Good morning. There was a lot of initial excitement around the House select committee tasked with investigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol securing the cooperation of former White House press secretary and longtime Donald Trump insider Stephanie Grisham.  According to sources, Grisham has told the committee that in the days leading up to the attack, Trump hosted secret meetings in the White House residence. Grisham was Melania Trump’s chief of staff when she resigned on 6 January 2021, the day Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in a bid to halt the election certification of Joe Biden’s win. Her interview with the House committee was more significant than expected, according to sources, with her informing investigators that details of whether Trump actually intended to march to the Capitol after his speech at the Ellipse rally would be memorialized in documents provided to the US Secret Service. What took place and who took part in these secret meetings is still unknown, but Grisham purportedly provided the names of other Trump aides who would have that information, including Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and former chief usher, Timothy Harleth. The supreme court has rejected Donald Trump’s request for an emergency stay to block the release of White House records to the House select committee tasked with investigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol – a blow to the former president that could shed significant light on his role in the events of the deadly day. This order allows the committee to obtain from the national archives more than 700 documents of some of the most sensitive White House records from Trump’s administration, including call logs, daily presidential diaries, handwritten notes and memos from his top aides. Yesterday Senate Democrats failed again to pass sweeping voter rights protections, as all 50 Republicans in the chamber united in opposition against the measure, as they’ve done for the past four months. Republicans once again blocked debate by relying on the filibuster, a Senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation to a final vote. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer’s plan to advance voter rights by amending the filibuster ultimately failed, with moderate Democrats Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema defending the parliamentary tactic, despite heavy pressure from the party and Joe Biden. This failure to pass voter rights protections was not just a loss for Democrats, but for Joe Biden, whose prospects look worse than ever.

1/20/2022,"As the tide rose, it began to look perilous for Millie the jack russell terrier, who had defied the efforts of police, firefighters and coastguards to pluck her from treacherous mudflats. So the rescuers had to think imaginatively, and came up with the idea of attaching a sausage to a drone and hoping the scent of the treat would tempt Millie to safety. It worked gloriously and Millie has been reunited with her grateful owner after following the dangling sausage to higher, safer ground.  Millie disappeared after slipping her lead in Havant, Hampshire, and after frantic public appeals was spotted on the mudflats, in danger of being engulfed by the tide. She resisted efforts to encourage her to a safer spot until a drone pilot suggested attaching food to one of the unmanned aerial vehicles that had been used to track the dog. “It was a crazy idea,” said Chris Taylor, the chair of the Denmead Drone Search and Rescue team. But they pressed ahead and after checking Civil Aviation Authority regulations, and the MTOW [maximum takeoff weight] of their machines, the rescuers calculated they could attach a single sausage to a drone. Taylor said: “One of the local residents on the beach where we were flying from supplied us with the sausages – I think they were from Aldi. The woman cooked them up for us and we attached them with string.” To the joy of the rescuers, Millie took the bait. “If we hadn’t had got her away from that area the tide would have come in and she would have been at risk of drowning,” said Taylor. “It was something we had never tried before – the sausages were the last resort, as we couldn’t reach her by kayak or any other means. “Because Millie was hungry it worked at luring her away from the danger to higher ground, which wouldn’t go underwater. We certainly would consider using sausages again: every dog and search operation is always going to be different, but if we were ever in a similar situation again we would employ the same methods to lure the dog.” Though the sausage worked, skittish Millie raced off again but was finally reunited with her owner, Emma Oakes, after being spotted inland from the marsh. She ran towards Oakes’s father, Tony, and jumped into his arms. Emma Oakes, a care manager, said: “Relief just poured over me. It was just absolutely fantastic to have her home.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Stranded dog saved from rising tide after rescuers attach sausage to drone,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/20/stranded-dog-saved-from-drowning-after-rescuers-attach-sausage-to-drone
1/20/2022,"The ECB has revealed a tweaked county structure for 2022 that returns more red-ball cricket to mid-summer but does not rip up everything and throw it to the wolves. After the summer scheduling came in for heavy criticism following England’s 4-0 Ashes drubbing, Neil Snowball, the ECB’s managing director of county cricket, accepted that change was on the way. He confirmed that 2022 was an interim year based more on autumn reaction from the counties than the winter’s mishaps.  “We’re still putting together the feedback from the tour,” he said, “and then we need to get the first-class counties, the ECB, the PCA and the other stakeholders together and work out a plan through this year so hopefully we can start making some changes from 2023. “So, whether it’s teams or whether it’s actual fixtures, I think we probably need to play less and focus on high intensity. A lot of this is about quality – it’s the quality of the cricket that we’re playing in the right conditions. I think that’s what we need to try to focus on. “I think what we need to do is have a comprehensive look at the picture and at all the things that we’ve talked about – whether it’s the ball, the pitches, the coaching, the domestic structure.” The County Championship will return on 7 April, with seven rounds in the June and July window when the weather and pitches should be palatable. There is a return to two division cricket, after the Covid-enforced group stages, with 10 teams in the top division, and eight in the second, the promotion and relegation places based on the results at the end of the 2019 summer.

1/20/2022,"The US state department has described the Uyghur human rights issue as a genocide and the largest-scale detention of an ethno-religious community since the second world war. And yet to hear one leading professional sports owner tell it, “nobody cares”.  Chamath Palihapitiya, a billionaire investor in the NBA’s Golden State Warriors, used the most recent episode of his All-In podcast to weigh in, dismissing the Uyghur crisis as “a very hard, ugly truth” that’s “below my line”. When his co-host David Sacks countered that the Uyghurs were a great, if not pressing, concern, Palihapitiya dug in: “If you’re asking me do I care about a segment of a class of people in another country? Not until we can take care of ourselves will I prioritise them over us.” There’s no doubt Palihapitiya’s comments were callous, selfish and confirmed popular suspicions of how the 1% views the world. But they were also an honest reflection of the NBA’s attitude towards the Uyghur genocide and China more generally. As Palihapitiya’s soundbite went viral over the weekend, the Warriors were quick to minimise his role with the team. “As a limited investor who has no day-to-day operating functions with the Warriors, Mr Palihapitiya does not speak on behalf of our franchise, and his views certainly don’t reflect those of our organisation,” the team said in a statement on Monday. Hours later, Palihapitiya circulated his own statement, recognising that “I come across as lacking empathy” upon re-listening to his comments. For the past seven years, Xi Jinping’s Chinese Communist party has advanced policies aimed at the Turkic Muslim Uyghur minority in the western Xinjiang region, marginalizing them to the brink of extinction. It’s believed that at least 1 million Uyghurs have been arbitrarily detained inside government internment camps. At more than 380 government black sites, Uyghurs have been subject to psychological indoctrination and forced sterilisation, while those detained have been coerced to manufacture clothing, face masks and other products. Ever since the Washington Bullets made history in August 1979 as the first US pro sports team to be invited to China following an ease in diplomatic relations, the NBA has owned the inside track on the sports world’s most coveted growth market. State media carried NBA games in the 1980s, fueling the game’s popularity. The global success of the 1992 USA Olympic squad, aka The Dream Team, inspired a generation of Chinese players. In 2002 the Houston Rockets chose Shanghai native Yao Ming with the draft’s top pick, marking the first time an international player had been selected that high without having previously played at a US college. And while China has not produced many NBA-calibre players besides Ming, a 2016 Naismith Hall of Fame inductee who chairs the Chinese Basketball Association, Stephon Marbury, Gilbert Arenas, Steve Francis and many others Americans have been enjoying blockbuster second acts playing in China after their NBA careers were done. This two-decades long cultural exchange has set the foundation for the NBA’s China operation, which has been valued at more than $5bn. But as the league’s interests in China have deepened, it has struggled to walk the line between respecting the free speech rights of its core stakeholders and appeasing its sensitive Chinese partners. Three years ago the Philadelphia 76ers’ Daryl Morey, one of the league’s most respected general managers, tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protests. The message cost him his position with the Houston Rockets and resulted in a temporary ban of NBA games on state TV – an estimated $400m hit. When LeBron James towed the company line and said Morey was “not really educated on the situation”, his standing in China took a major hit, and Hong Kongers took to the streets again to protest him. Last fall Chinese TV blacked out a Boston Celtics games after centre Enes Kaenter Freedom, a Swiss-born Turkish Muslim who has been a strident CCP critic, assailed the state’s human rights record in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. In 2020 allegations of child abuse surfaced at NBA-supported, CCP-run basketball academies, including one in Xinjiang. And while the NBA closed the Xinjiang academy in the wake of those allegations, its business relationship with China did not fundamentally change. The Guardian emailed the league for a statement on Palihapitiya; it did not respond. Given the efforts the NBA has made to market itself as a league that’s more attuned to injustice than others – two years ago the Milwaukee Bucks led a weekend long sports walkout following the shooting of Jacob Blake, for example – some critics including Ted Cruz, Tucker Carlson have claimed the NBA only care about social justice when it isn’t bad for business. They have a point. But where they lose it is in trying to hold into account Black players, coaches and team executives who prioritise the fight against racism in America (something they experience in their daily lives) over a genocide halfway around the world. If anyone should take responsibility, it’s Silver and the league’s owners for putting profits ahead of the human cost. It’s not just the NBA. Late last year tennis pro Peng Shuai, mysteriously disappeared after she made sexual assault allegations against a Communist Party leader. This issue has yet to be fully resolved, yet only the WTA stopped their activities in China in response; other leagues have not stopped their relations with China in solidarity. Beijing is weeks away from hosting the Winter Olympics and in December, the Biden administration cited the “ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity … and other human rights abuses”, as the reason they wouldn’t be sending a government delegation to the games. But that boycott has been denounced by World Athletics president Sebastian Coe as “a hollow, meaningless and damaging gesture”— a stance that could have something to do with the two Diamond League athletics events that are slated for Chinese soil this summer. Hence why it’s so surprising that Palihapitiya would be the one to give voice to the sports world’s apathy toward the Uyghurs. Until he opened his mouth, few NBA fans knew him. A founding member of Facebook’s management team, Palihapitiya helped spearhead the portal’s transformation into a $100bn business – only to come to regret that effort. “The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works,” he told an audience at Stanford’s business school in 2017. Last January, Palihapitiya announced plans to challenge incumbent Gavin Newsom in California’s gubernatorial recall election, promising to bump the state tax down to 0 from 16% if elected. But he pulled out less than a month later. Palihapitiya, whose family fled Sri Lanka for Canada when he was a child, acknowledged this history in his clarifying statement on Monday. “As a refugee, my family fled a country with its own set of human rights issues so this is something that is very much a part of my lived experience,” he wrote. “To be clear, my belief is that human rights matter, whether in China, the United States, or elsewhere.

1/20/2022,"There is a terrific warmth and tenderness to Kenneth Branagh’s elegiac, autobiographical movie about the Belfast of his childhood: spryly written, beautifully acted and shot in a lustrous monochrome, with set pieces, madeleines and epiphanies that feel like a more emollient version of Terence Davies. Some may feel that the film is sentimental or that it does not sufficiently conform to the template of political anger and despair considered appropriate for dramas about Northern Ireland and the Troubles. And yes, there is certainly a spoonful of sugar (or two) in the mix, with some mandatory Van Morrison on the soundtrack. There’s a key climactic scene about how you disarm a gunman in the middle of a riot if you have no gun yourself, which has to be charitably indulged.  But this film has such emotional generosity and wit and it tackles a dilemma of the times not often understood: when, and if, to pack up and leave Belfast? Is it an understandable matter of survival or an abandonment of your beloved home town to the extremists? (Full disclosure: my own dad left Belfast for England, though well before the era of this film.) It is 1969 and Jamie Dornan plays a man who lives in north Belfast, a largely Protestant district but still with some Catholic families. He is an easygoing charmer, away in England a fair bit during the week, doing skilled carpentry work and harassed with the need to pay off a tax bill. When his long-suffering wife (Caitríona Balfe) writes to the Inland Revenue asking for confirmation that his debt is finally paid off, it prompts the authorities to look further into his murky affairs and decide he owes another £500. This is such a horribly unglamorous, un-cinematic moment that it surely has to be taken from real life. The family includes two boys, the older Will (Lewis McAskie) and younger Buddy, played by newcomer Jude Hill, whose stunned, wide-eyed incomprehension sets the tone. The grandparents live with them under the same roof and are played with beguiling sweetness by Ciarán Hinds and Judi Dench (the latter pinches every scene by deflating the menfolk with wisecracking remarks from behind her copy of the People’s Friend). Violence explodes when unionist hardmen burn the Catholics out of their homes and set up barricades to protect their new fiefdom against republican retaliation – a gangsterism that requires payments from local families, enforced by tough guy Billy Clanton (Colin Morgan), accepted more or less pragmatically by local man Frankie West (a great cameo from Michael Maloney) but resented by Dornan’s character. He starts showing his wife and kids assisted-emigrant brochures for Vancouver and Sydney: places beyond the reach of the terrorists and the taxman but so alien they might as well feature on Star Trek, which the boys watch on TV every week. And poor Buddy just has to carry on with his life, which involves much unrequited pining for a girl in his class. The film moves with an easy swing from home to street to schoolroom to pub and back home, and it’s perhaps fullest and richest when nothing specifically tragic or Troubles-related is happening. I loved the scene in which Buddy is schooled on what to say if a stranger demands to know if he is Protestant or Catholic: does he lie or double-bluff with the truth? (I was reminded of the Dave Allen routine about what happens if you try sitting on the fence and claiming you’re Jewish – the hard man replies: “Are you a Protestant Jew or a Catholic Jew?”) The family get some escapism at the movies: Raquel Welch in her furry bikini in One Million Years BC, the flying car going over the cliff in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, and High Noon on TV. There’s a trip to the theatre to see A Christmas Carol; the late John Sessions gives his final performance as the Belfast stage actor Joseph Tomelty playing Marley’s ghost. But inevitably Buddy gets drawn into some scrapes: nicking a bar of Turkish delight and then getting involved in looting a box of washing powder from a riot-hit supermarket. It’s not quite right to say that there’s a streak of innocence in the nightmare of this film, but certainly a streak of normality and even banality, which assumes its own surreal tone. Love letters to the past are always addressed to an illusion, yet this is such a seductive piece of myth-making from Branagh.  Belfast is released on 21 January in cinemas.",Arts/Film,Belfast review – Kenneth Branagh’s euphoric eulogy to his home city,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/12/belfast-review-kenneth-branagh-jamie-dornan-judi-dench
1/20/2022,"On Tuesday evening, Nick Kyrgios was leaning into the stands taking swigs of a spectator’s beer. Two days later there was none of the showboating he so relishes at John Cain Arena. “Kyrgios Court”, as he calls it, is not the same as centre court, and a qualifier is not the same as a world No 2. Against Daniil Medvedev there were none of the cheeky antics displayed as he defeated Brit Liam Broady in the first round. Indeed, any hint of that signature jaunty smile during his more masterful moments – and there were a few during this belter of a second-round battle – vanished during those that were left wanting.  By the end of the two hours and 58 minutes, Medvedev had simply produced more of the former and fewer of the latter. He is, after all, the reigning US Open champion and the tournament favourite. Pre-match, his Australian opponent described him as “probably the best player in the world at the moment”. Which, with the benefit of hindsight, is another way of saying Kyrgios is a pretty good player too. This 7-6 (1), 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 contest was one of fine margins between two players separated in age by only 18 months. Both boast big serves and a brilliantly varied technical repertoire. Only one has a big personality. And so the home crowd, sold out at 50% capacity, felt every emotion of the man they had come to see, who both celebrated and berated his supporters depending whether he was on the ascension or self-imploding. Medvedev, conversely, was a picture of unyielding calm, of almost machine-like consistency. In what gear he was operating we may never be sure. “I think no matter what the score is or how much pressure he’s under, he never kind of gets flustered,” Kyrgios said. “He just has so much belief in his game. I think he led the tour in wins last year. He’s just so confident right now. To be honest, I threw everything I could at him.” As it turned out, Medvedev simply saved his verbals for the end, when he complained to everyone who would listen that the now-infamous “siuuu” calls which have overtaken Melbourne Park and often came between his serves were disrespectful. “I guess some people just have a low IQ,” he told Eurosport, shortly after writing “siuuuu” on a broadcast camera lens above his signature. Like other players in the opening days of competition, he thought he had been booed. “[Remaining calm and focused] is the only choice when you get booed between first and second serve. You have to stay calm and win the match,” he told Jim Courier in his on-court interview. That prompted an avalanche of either boos or siuus, which drowned out Courier’s next question. “Sorry, I can’t hear you. Show some respect for Jim Courier. Let him speak please,” Medvedev added. “If you respect somebody, at least respect Jim Courier.” Cheers followed. The US great was quick on the uptake. “I think they are saying ‘siuuu’ which is a soccer, football, thing … I don’t think they are booing you.” Kyrgios felt it was the chair umpire’s job “to control the crowd and monitor it” but said the atmosphere was “awesome”. “You’ve got, like, you know, the most entertaining player playing in his home slam on Rod Laver – you’d expect the crowd to be like that,” he said of himself. “I can understand it’s a gentleman’s game, but it’s about time that people embraced some sort of different energy in this sport, otherwise it will die out.” On the court, the respect between Kyrgios and Medvedev was evident. That was clear in the way Kyrgios only feigned a tweener in the very first game, rather than actually going through with it. He failed to convert two break points in the second, was broken in the third, lost the fourth almost to love and won the fifth with an underarm serve. At times Kyrgios hypnotised the Russian with deliberately slow groundstrokes, forcing him to make the first move and then quickening the pace and ferocity in an instant. He toyed with his opponent’s serve, sending down a top-spin forehand, a sliced backhand and then a delicate volley. Medvedev, being Medvedev, responded with two aces (he served 31 all up). When Kyrgios broke back to level the score at 4-4 it seemed as if something magical might happen. When he lost the tie-break 7-1 a meltdown felt imminent. A spectator squawked for him to “serve underarm” and he gave them an expletive-ridden piece of his mind. The crowd can be inconvenient sometimes. Medvedev again rose to the occasion in the second set. Up 4-3, he drew Kyrgios in and then spat him back out, sent him scurrying in vain to the baseline for one of the less aesthetically pleasing tweener attempts on his resume – a genuine one this time – before digging his own hole to climb out of. Three deuces later he did, and set about a victory dance, his racket and towel flailing up and down with his arms. The crowd once again had permission to engage. Two games later the inner monologue must have been even louder as he shot an anguished look to the heavens for some assistance to save him from two set points. When Medvedev converted the second he slumped to the changeover, muttering “I can’t serve any bigger” and using his arms to motion Medvedev’s relentless returns. And it was true – Medvedev kept hitting them back. The admirable restraint also remained throughout the hoo-ha up the other end. The gesticulations and code violations, whooping and cursing. Sometimes Kyrgios was in a rivalry with himself. Sometimes it was with the serve clock. Nevertheless, the third set was his, sealed with a drop shot. But Medvedev would not be beaten. In the fourth stanza he earned the crucial break to go up 4-2. When he made it 5-2 to love Kyrgios smashed his racket, pulled out a new one and then lost his final service game via two unforced errors. Medvedev flicked his hand like a rapper and swaggered, cool as a cucumber, over to where Courier was waiting for that interview. “You have tough opponents like Nick here,” Medvedev said. “That is why we love tennis. Any match, anything can happen. I just want to play my best and try to run good, to hit good shots, hit some winners and hopefully this can be enough to do something big.” He will next face Botic van de Zandschulp of the Netherlands, with likely more scalps to come. But if this is not the match of the tournament by the end of next week, it will certainly come close.",Sport/Sport,Daniil Medvedev sees off Nick Kyrgios and takes swipe at ‘low IQ’ crowd,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/daniil-medvedev-sees-off-nick-kyrgios-and-takes-swipe-at-low-iq-crowd-australian-open-tennis
1/20/2022,"On Wednesday, Boris Johnson’s government announced that plan B measures for England, which were put in place in December, will be scrapped. This includes mandates on face coverings, which will no longer be compulsory in indoor public spaces from 27 January or for secondary school classrooms from 20 January. The Department for Education is likely to remove guidance on their use in school communal areas in the coming days. This is in stark contrast to what other countries are doing in the midst of the Omicron pandemic – and let’s not forget, this is still a pandemic. With daily Covid-19 case numbers in the UK still above 100,000, and more than 400 deaths a day, our situation is among the worst in the world. Though our case numbers are indeed falling, this may well be partly due to the measures imposed in plan B, such as wearing face masks and working from home. There is a risk that the removal of these measures could reverse this trend.  Scotland is mitigating against this risk by maintaining the face mask mandate when it removes most restrictions from Monday. The US, meanwhile, is an example of a country enacting more stringent measures in order to bring the pandemic under control. Next week, the Biden administration will make 400m N95 (FFP2) masks available for free in the largest deployment of PPE in US history. We know that, when they fit well, these high-efficiency masks do an excellent job of protecting wearers and preventing the spread of infection. In fact, on 17 January, the UK Health Security Agency changed its guidance for healthcare workers so that FFP3 respirators (EU-certified masks) must be worn by staff when “caring for patients with a suspected or confirmed infection spread by the airborne route”. This is long overdue. And yet when it comes the public, the government seems much happier to throw caution to the wind. For people in England, the use of face coverings – of any sort – is no longer required. This does not mean that the risk of transmitting Covid-19 or being infected by it has reduced. Omicron continues to be the most infectious variant of Covid-19. While the mask mandate may have gone, and some people will joyously doff their masks, many will remain rightly concerned about Covid-19, the potential for getting long Covid and the effect that the lack of restrictions will have on the lives of vulnerable people. People will also be keen to avoid time off work isolating with Covid and recovering from the illness. So how can you protect yourself when most people stop wearing masks? The best way is to wear a mask that is designed to protect the wearer: an FFP2 or FFP3 mask. These are available in pharmacies, supermarkets and online, but you may need to try a few to find one that fits the shape of your face. If you want to avoid exposing others to your exhaled breath, make sure you choose a valveless mask. Although “disposable”, these masks can be reused until they break or become visibly unhygienic. I recommend using several in rotation, to allow them to “decontaminate” between uses. Masks with head straps will fit better and may last longer. Metal nose clips (as opposed to plastic ones) usually mould better to your nose, providing a closer fit – but unfortunately it can be hard to know before buying them which type of clip is used. While many industry-certified masks come as a standard size, smaller-sized masks are increasingly available. Nondisposable masks (sometimes called elastomeric respirators, if they are made from rubber) are also available. While these may resemble gas masks, with external cartridges that hold the filters, manufacturers are now designing these for public use, with simple, replaceable FFP2 or FFP3 filters that slot into the plastic frame and look no more threatening than disposable high-efficiency masks. The government says that it’s now up to us to assess our own risk and how we will mitigate it (although people are still advised to continue to wear face coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces and when meeting strangers). While we may not have choices about going to work or school, or how we get there, if we choose to, we can continue to use face masks to protect ourselves effectively. And don’t forget, anyone can have Covid … not just strangers.

1/20/2022,"Kate Clanchy and her publisher Pan Macmillan will no longer be working together, and distribution of all of her titles is to cease, following widespread criticism last summer of her book Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me. Readers took to Goodreads and Twitter to point out racial tropes and ableist descriptions in the Orwell prize-winning book about Clanchy’s experience as a teacher. For example, one child was described as being “so small and square and Afghan with his big nose and premature moustache” while two autistic students were said to be “jarring company”.  As a result of the complaints, Clanchy issued an apology in August and announced that her publisher had given her the opportunity to rewrite parts of the book. However, in a joint statement by Clanchy and Pan Macmillan published in the Bookseller on Thursday, it was revealed that plans for the revised version, which had been due to come out in autumn 2021, have now been scrapped. “By mutual agreement, Pan Macmillan and Kate Clanchy have decided to part company,” the statement reads. “Pan Macmillan will not publish new titles nor any updated editions from Kate Clanchy, and will revert the rights and cease distribution of Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me and her other works.” “Pan Macmillan wishes Kate Clanchy all the best for the future.” This means that Friend: Poems by Young People, an anthology of work by Clanchy’s pupils, will no longer be published by Pan Macmillan in March as planned. Debates over Clanchy’s work and wider issues around sensitivity in the publishing industry were reignited in December when Clanchy wrote an article for Prospect magazine entitled “Ostracised, disinvited, rescinded: what it’s like to get cancelled”. This followed a feature in the Telegraph about the “crisis” facing literary fiction, in which Pan Macmillan publisher Philip Gwyn Jones expressed “regrets” about how he and his colleagues had handled the initial criticism of Clanchy’s book. “We weren’t clear enough in our support for the author and her rights,” he told the newspaper, before later apologising for the remarks on Twitter. After the initial complaints about Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me surfaced in August, writers such as Philip Pullman and Amanda Craig came to Clanchy’s defence, while three of the book’s critics, Chimene Suleyman, Monisha Rajesh and Sunny Singh, received racist abuse from social media users. This led to an an open letter in their support, which was signed by more than 1,000 people. The events prompted an open invitation signed by the authors Nikesh Shukla and Yara Rodrigues Fowler among others which proposed the formation of a group that would “change the UK publishing industry for the better”. “Writers and workers frustrated by injustice in publishing should join a union and organise,” Rodrigues Fowler told the Guardian. “It is the only way to change the industry. History shows us that politely asking profit-driven corporations to change never works, but building collective power does.”",Arts/Books,Kate Clanchy ‘parts company’ with publisher after discrimination row,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/20/kate-clanchy-parts-company-from-publisher-after-discrimination-row
1/20/2022,"Commuters have welcomed their freedom to return to the office, despite many believing the government’s motives had more to do with political expediency than science. “We’re opening back up today for a mixture of reasons, the biggest of which is that the government needs a distraction because of all the things that have been going on in Downing Street,” said Marianne Phillips, an accountant on her way to the office for the first time since the pandemic began, at Euston station on Wednesday morning.  “But even though they might be opening up for the wrong reasons, it’s still the right time for people to get back to the office. Especially as any responsible company will be taking precautions – we’re being allowed to work flexitime, so we can avoid rush hours. I am slightly nervous because it’s been a long time but it’s the right thing to do, to get back to the office, and I’m happy I’m doing it,” she said. Emma Reeves, who works in the charity sector, was taking the opportunity to go to the office to collect some equipment before returning to work from home. “The government has only told us it’s OK to come back to the office because they want to be seen to be doing something,” she said. “We’ve had the same rules in place for ages and they need to change them every so often, to look like they know what they’re doing. “Having said that, the economy does need to recover and as long as I’m not required to commute during rush hour, I don’t mind coming in a few days a week.” Diana Ursachi, an accountant, said she wanted to return to her workplace full-time. “We lost my dad from Covid during the pandemic, so it’s not been easy,” she said. “But I’ve had Covid, I’ve had my three jabs, and it’s time to get back to normal. We live with other diseases. We need to learn to live with this one now.” But others were more sceptical. “How can they change the rules from one day to the next after just one little speech?” asked Yasmine Ikhlef, a business developer for the construction industry, who was at East Finchley station in north London. “It’s not right or fair to spend two years telling people that they can’t leave their house for fear of dying – and then suddenly say it’s OK to go back to work. I don’t trust this decision has anything to do with the science,” she added. “I fully expect that, in a few months, we’ll be told we need to all work from home again.” Others said they have made the decision for themselves already. Paul Lin, a website developer who was at Euston station, said: “I used to spend a fortune to waste between two and four hours commuting into London every day from Bedfordshire,” he said. “But the pandemic has changed all that. “I wouldn’t take any contract now that required me to work more than one day a week in the office. There’s still some resistance to that idea in my industry, but as far as I’m concerned, the pandemic has proven it’s not necessary for us to work in offices for even the majority of the time – my sector especially can work from home perfectly efficiently. “The old ways are gone now,” he added. “Employees’ attitudes have changed and employers are just going to have to catch up.”",News/World news,London commuters welcome office return but some say move is No 10 diversion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/20/london-commuters-welcome-return-to-work-but-some-say-move-is-no-10-diversion
