1/9/2022,"Practically everyone has a view on Boris Johnson. Far fewer, whether friend or foe of his party, have much clue what binds Johnsonism together or even if this is a meaningful taxonomy at all. Whether a leader has an “ism” to their name does not always matter very much in the scheme of political success. Blair’s “traditional values in a modern setting” could just as easily be described the other way round, but the blend was the point. Among Tory progressives, the Cameron era is lauded by rose-tinted memories as a much clearer ideological prospectus than the pragmatic pick-and-mix it was. Angela Merkel’s near decade and a half in power in Germany was a mix of stolid instinct and sudden pivots. And yet the quest to understand what Johnsonism means looms larger at the start of 2022 as the prime minister faces resistance to Covid-era restrictions in his ranks. The introduction of the vaccine passport limiting access to big events to the jabbed has infuriated traditional allies, leaving the PM’s loyalists crossing fingers that the calculation of modest restrictions pays off if the Omicron variant declines in the next few weeks and overloaded hospitals are finally relieved. If, as one of his oldest friends and backers put it to me, his present curse is that “Tories think he is doing unTory things they don’t understand”, he can change those things. Or alternatively, he can explain his narrative more persuasively to keep his internal coalition intact and avoid more uprisings of the kind that left him relying on Labour votes to get his latest Covid measures through the Commons before Christmas.  Covid management dominated the end of the year, but the twin squeezes of inflation (predicted by the Bank of England to reach a peak of 6% by the spring) and soaring energy bills have moved higher up the worry list as the Commons returned last week. That provided the political box-office highlight of the week At prime minister’s questions, Labour’s deputy leader, Angela Rayner, stood in for Keir Starmer. The result was a zesty Beatrice-versus-Benedict encounter Shakespeare might have applauded: “Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes.” Rayner hit a nerve with a question that might well be on Tory MPs’ minds too. The 2016 version of Johnsonism had highlighted potential “Brexit dividends”, including the ability to vary or remove VAT rates, currently at 5% on fuel bills. So why not do so? That was the subject of a long debate in cabinet too and the result remains in the balance. Surging global energy price rises are bedevilling leaders across Europe and while the energy price cap has given consumers some protection this winter, many household fuel bills will double by April – the time when national insurance rises will also kick in and May elections will look like a punishing midterm test. This impending “Krakatoa moment”, as one minister put it, means that priorities (cutting NHS waiting lists) collide with a pledge the PM gave his colleagues after the budget to avoid further tax rises to pay for more spending. These choices are also consolidating fresh alignments in the Conservative party. The north-west MP Jake Berry has just accused the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, of introducing “stealth tax” – his rises will affect well over one million taxpayers on the basic rate. The demand MPs are finding in their inboxes, replacing pre-Christmas outpourings of anger about No 10 social gatherings, is for a swift announcement on some form of help to offset the domestic hit of oil energy prices. Unusually, Johnson and Sunak share the same caution on the “simple” solution of removing VAT on energy bills. The PM is wary of a cut that would be both small (relative to the size of galloping bills) and poorly targeted, benefiting consumers with bigger homes; he would rather means-test any relief. Sunak, too, wonders whether removing a relatively small VAT component from household bills would not get the government much thanks. But more targeted relief for poorer households inevitably leaves those just above thresholds aggrieved. While the government equivocates about options, Labour can wield pressure on a subject it knows gets the electorate’s attention. More than any other present-day politician in Britain, Johnson understood a shift in relations between the public and politicians, namely that swing voters were unbothered by inconsistencies so long as they liked the bearer of the message and his eclectic mix of attitudes. The Johnson I have known since his university days has repeatedly applied a vigorous cocktail shaker of aspects of various political philosophies to his purpose. His stump speeches condemned footling bureaucracy whether in Whitehall, local councils or Brussels as constraining innovation and prosperity. In practice, during his exercise of limited but symbolic power in two terms as London mayor, very often his quest was for more money from central government for grands projets – from dockland development to infrastructure schemes like a London airport in the Thames estuary (theoretically not a terrible idea, but destined for the “never gonna happen” file). The objection to criticism of Johnson as a caricature of Tory stinginess is that he has, in fact, turned out to be rather fond of spending other people’s money. And that is precisely the pain point now, as the emergency period of Covid abates and decisions about wider spending priorities cannot be fudged or delegated. The “conversion to (higher-tax) Brownism” is now a frequent jibe from disappointed fiscal hawks, which must be an enjoyable moment for the former Labour chancellor to savour. It is true that Johnsonism remains an edifice built on a complex construction of paradoxes. A freewheeling UK that has shaken off EU constraints via the Brexit he championed ends up raising the minimum wage and the signs are that levelling up will endorse the European habit of guiding industrial policy towards investment in stressed regions. A plan to “rouse Britain in the world” as a mercantilist revival (recall Liz Truss’s valiant dining out at a glitzy private restaurant in her days as trade secretary to coddle US favours on commerce) has so far not offset a sharp fall of imports and exports relative to comparable countries. Getting stuff in and out of the UK has got harder – and often more expensive. A burst of spring inflation plus an energy squeeze sounds like the most miserable bits of the 1970s in one inglorious go. Any leader would struggle with that prospect and the challenge is of allocating resources between an NHS in need of funds or help directed to voters via tax relief or offsets to fuel bills. With a party divided between those who see looser spending as inevitable or even welcome and those who see it as a betrayal of fiscal discipline, Johnson finds himself riding two unruly horses pulling in opposite directions. These differences can be managed, but to do so the tousled helmsman will need to explain which recipe for “cake-ism” he has plumped for. If there is a philosophical core to the Johnsonian creed in power it is “unite and level up” the country. It was the centrepiece pledge of the PM’s conference speech – “the magic sauce – the ketchup of catch-up”. He might propose in the poetry of Edward Lear, but levelling up in practice means governing in the prose of local devolution, including to parts of the country controlled by political rivals. Michael Gove has been entrusted with the detail, working with Neil O’Brien, a shrewd import to the No 10 policy unit with a solid track record in exploring ways to address regional imbalances. Of the everlasting Johnson-Gove frenemy relationship, one veteran who has worked for both notes that “Boris treats Michael like the swotty boy whose essays he borrows in a hurry for exam time”. Financial relief for leaseholders threatened with punitive costs by landlords to replace risky cladding, due to be announced next week, exemplifies Gove’s role as problem solver for the PM. It’s also the first time I remember the Johnson government acting against the interests of property developers, a heavily influential lobby when Johnson was in City Hall. That exam deadline is getting closer if the resulting legislation is to have real impact before the next elections in stressed parts of the country and boost the Tories’ hopes of retaining a swathe of the trophy seats they won from Labour at the last election. Winners and losers will soon become apparent, personal affinities and aversions too. Ministers like working with Dan Jarvis, the affable Labour mayor in South Yorkshire, but find Andy Burnham in Manchester “trying because he’s on a permanent war footing”. The reality is that “rebalancing” the country will demand that ministers and mayors of different politics find ways to pursue common interests. Most likely, the delayed launch of the draft legislation in December was driven by a desire to avoid a keystone policy colliding with headlines about rule-breaking parties and probes into Johnson’s foolish handling of an expensive domestic refurbishment. Much more delay though will make levelling up look like a metaphor in search of a meaning. The redistribution of opportunity, education and affluence can help fill out the hollowness at the heart of the Johnsonism. Tick tock.

1/9/2022,"Hair trends in 2021 ranged from the “shallet” – a shaggy mullet preferred by Miley Cyrus and Rihanna – to the buzzcut, as seen on Iris Law and Adwoa Aboah. But this year it’s a technique, rather than a style, that is increasingly likely to be requested at salons. The phrase you’ll need to know is: “instinctive cutting”. This technique is not for the faint-hearted. It involves a hairdresser cutting freehand, based on their thoughts on a client’s face shape, hair type and product routine. This differs from the typical “picture” first approach, where a client shows an image of a celebrity with a haircut they want. With instinctive cutting, the goal – and the aspiration – is a haircut as unique as its wearer.  George Northwood, whose celebrity clients include Alicia Vikader, Rachel Weisz and the Duchess of Sussex, practises instinctive cutting. The result, he says, is that “the client will emerge from the chair with hair that works specifically for them; rather than with a reproduction of something which doesn’t look or feel right”. Jacqueline Kilikita, the senior beauty editor at Refinery29 feminist website, recently wrote about the trend, saying she had first encountered the phrase on the websites of fashionable hairdressers such as Northwood, Adam Reed and Hare & Bone. She experienced the technique herself at The Hair Bros. “They chopped inches off of my lengths, layering and razoring as they went,” she says. “The result was a cut that complemented me perfectly and I love it. I haven’t straightened my hair since - huge for me, as I used to do that every day – because the cut allows me to embrace my natural waves.” Kilikita says the growing popularity of such a technique can be seen as part of the wider impact of the pandemic on self-image. “We want low-maintenance hair that’s going to look effortless in real life and on Zoom,” she says. “For many, being isolated has allowed us to be our most authentic selves, and instinctive cutting is all about embracing individuality.” Northwood says more clients are becoming aware of the technique, which tallies with other trends: “Now that personalisation is more commonplace, everyone seems to have higher expectations. Bespoke styling responds to the needs of the individual and rarely disappoints.” A good relationship between client and hairdresser is essential. “More successful hairdressers will have an immediate instinct for what will work best for their client,” says Northwood. “Without this, the outcome can be safe or at worst, unsuitable.” Showing pictures can still be useful. “Bring pictures of haircuts you love so that the stylist can get a feel for your aesthetic,” says Kilikita. “While they probably won’t refer to those images during the cut, they’re likely to take elements of the style – a fringe or layers – and make them unique to you.” Northwood cautions: “Not all hairdressers are aware of what instinctive cutting is, so I recommend that you just ask your stylist to follow their instinct. Be sure to offer a yardstick in the form of images you like, to ensure that both of you are in a similar territory beforehand.” Tom Warr, the academy director at London salon chain Blue Tit, doesn’t use the term “instinctive cutting”, but he encourages trainees to think on their feet when presented with a picture: “If someone shows you a picture of like a really sharp fringe, and you notice they have a massive cow’s lick, that’s something that you may want to talk about with the client in terms of their expectations.” Warr uses images to give him an idea of his client’s ideas and dislikes. “I like to see if I get their personality [so] there’ll be a lot of icebreaker questions, trying to get to know them,” he says. “You’re weighing up their vibe. That can help loads with the end result.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,"Chop, chop … Why unique haircuts are in vogue for 2022",https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/09/chop-chop-why-unique-haircuts-are-in-vogue-for-2022
1/9/2022,"This week I have been wishing people a happy new year so regularly and so earnestly that the phrase has chipped off in my mouth and come loose like a bad tooth. I need to put it together again, piece by piece. It requires elaboration, this year more than most, because a happy new year for me may be an entirely awful one for you, and if the pandemic has taught us anything beyond the benefits of opening a window, it is clear and present empathy. So, to clarify: Happy new year to you if you’re a parent of a primary school-age kid. Yours has been a year lived as if sleeping with one hand in warm water, leaping up desperately at regular intervals convinced you’ve pissed yourself. Being the parent of a young child is stressful at the best of times. At the worst of times it is a struggle akin to trying to cross a motorway in bare feet after too much coffee. The year 2020 saw you teaching them trigraphs while nodding along to a Zoom meeting on mute. Then 2021 saw you watching their classmates’ positive test results flash up on your WhatsApp while nodding along to a Zoom meeting on mute. As you gratefully offered your arm for a vaccine, then another, then another little one for luck, each sharp scratch a little crumb of Valium, your young children were still waiting for their first. Were trotting alongside you, reeling off facts about photosynthesis or how to make purple, every now and then stopping to quietly note the unmasked status of a stranger. Were waking in the middle of the night from surreal nightmares where death arrived on a crowded bus or where they were the monster. It was not a case of whether Covid would visit your house, it was a case of when. Where’s Covid? Is it behind the tree? No! Is it under the rug? No! Is it sweeping through the school canteen like the smell of chips? You’ll find out on Friday. I wish you a new year of vaccinations and small relaxations, and a gradual slowing of your very tapping leg.  Happy new year if you’re a Tory MP. Can’t be worse than last year can it? Happy new year if you’re the owner of a lockdown pet. It was a good idea. No! No, it was, it was a good idea. You made the right choice. You did! You did. It’s going to be fine. This year your cat will stop staring at you with those “how dare you?” eyes. Your new sofa will not be gutted like the last, which you rose one morning to find disembowelled, its foamy guts now strewn across the carpet, the cat surveying the devastation from her post on the counter. This year your puppy will listen when you say, “Down!”, will not take it as a challenge to see how many steaks he can grab from the table, will not reply at a volume that causes neighbours to stick livid little notes through your letterbox, will not whine like Veruca Salt. This year your allergy will disappear, your eyes will dry, your itches cease. Your dog will finally become comfortable around men with beards, simply sitting quietly and allowing them to talk to you in the street, the urge to protect you from their aggressive facial hair by leaping up and barking like a fire alarm having passed by mid-Jan. The pressure of having to train and manage them will this year be eclipsed by the comfort of their warm body and hot meat breath. Their grand love will bury the burden like a bone. Happy new year if you’re self-isolating. The stages of self-isolation – anger, fear, boredom, cheese – became blurry the second or third time round and now, as a new year breaks like an egg on your forehead, the feeling is one of cold, white numbness. Long ago you stopped arguing with the internet, shouting at the prime minister that before telling us to get tested and self-isolate it was his responsibility to make sure we had the ability and support to do either. That our “resilience” is running low. It is tempting to slip into familiar psychological patterns of doom, where feelings of pointlessness and anxiety dance badly together across the filthy kitchen table, but I wish you a happy new year, where isolation breeds, not quiet, but creativity. Whether you’re alone or among an overheated family, I wish you… OK not a whole year, too intimidating, but instead a series of hours that spread into days then months, where you’re able to replace the discontent of lockdown with moments of meditative peace, cosiness, time spent counting your various and disparate blessings, before returning to something quite good on TV. Happy new year if you’re a new variant. Ah, come in, we’ve been expecting you. Good journey? Sorry – no spikes on in the house. If you wouldn’t mind just snapping off that one, and that one, yes, all of them off, sorry. Sorry! And then if you just want to pop through to the boiling vat of drugs we’ll meet you in there in a sec. Yep, just behind you. See you in there.

1/9/2022,"Hanya Yanagihara’s debut novel taught her not to give up her day job as a travel writer and editor. The People in the Trees was the story of a scientist jailed for sexually abusing children he adopted during his Nobel-winning research on a Pacific island. It impressed reviewers with its exhaustive inventiveness and its refusal to offer redemption or solace, but sold only a few thousand copies when it was published in 2013. Two years later, the Manhattan-based writer released a novel that was twice as long and even less forgiving. It was about the fallout, among four college friends, from the appalling childhood sexual abuse of one of their group, and it hit the jackpot, becoming one of those vanishingly rare literary break-outs. Victoria Beckham and Dua Lipa declared themselves fans, while an equally passionate group of readers condemned it as gratuitous, even “evil”. A Little Life sold a quarter of a million print copies in the UK alone, where it was shortlisted for the Booker and the Women’s prize for fiction. But far from giving up her day job, Yanagihara took on a bigger one, as editor-in-chief of T, the New York Times style magazine.  When we meet up, at an upmarket London hotel in October, she is combining a whistlestop publicity trip for her third novel, To Paradise, with two weeks of European fashion shows that have left her with “a mysterious illness” which, she hastens to add, is definitely not Covid. The jaunt is a twice-yearly ritual: menswear and furniture shows the spring and summer, then women’s ready-to-wear in the autumn. “I do New York, Milan and Paris, and I always end up getting sick. Usually it’s a cold or flu, so this is a new one for me,” she says, brandishing hands flushed with tiny red spots. She is determined not to let her mystery ailment get in the way of a promotional campaign that began six months earlier when news of To Paradise was teased to the book trade. “Do you remember where you were when you finished A Little Life? And where were you when you heard that Hanya Yanagihara’s new novel arrives next year? Right here,” tweeted Waterstones at the time – an enthusiasm rewarded by Yanagihara in proof copies of To Paradise, with a personal note of thanks to all the booksellers who had pressed her work into readers’ hands. Like its predecessor, To Paradise is a brick of a book that checks in at well over 700 pages and is set largely in New York. But there the similarity ends. This is a very different city, which is seen in three different iterations in a trio of time zones. There’s perhaps another motive behind Yanagihara’s note to the booksellers: until you get the hang of it, which takes the length of an ordinary-sized novel, it’s all a bit disorientating, not least because – for reasons to do with its preoccupation with inherited privilege – the protagonists in all three timezones are all named David, Edward and Charles/Charlie Bingham. It is, however, most definitely worth hanging on in. “It’s a mature masterpiece, which makes A Little Life look overcaffeinated,” says veteran novelist Edmund White, who emerged as an early champion with a Facebook post that To Paradise was “as good as War and Peace”. In the first section we’re in 1893, at the heart of fin-de-siècle society with clear Jamesian resonances (it centres on a big family house in Washington Square), except that this New York is a breakaway republic where same-sex marriage is the norm. “I’d always wanted to write a marriage story, but marriage stories are about money, and I wondered, if you wrote one that wasn’t about gender norms, and gender rules, what would that marriage story be? And beyond that, what would that history be?” says Yanagihara. In the second section we move to 1993, where an unnamed plague is laying waste to the complacency of the next generation of Davids, Charleses and Edwards. In the third section we’re in a dystopian 2093 where the personal and social freedoms of David, Charles and his granddaughter Charlie have been sacrificed to the demands of controlling wave upon wave of pandemics. It’s all scarily plausible: a “what if?” novel combined with a “what when?” one, I suggest. “And what is,” says Yanagihara. What it is not, though, is a response to Covid. She had the idea of the novel in 2016 and started researching it in earnest shortly after the election of Donald Trump, at a point when “history suddenly started to move very quickly, raising questions about whether we were who we had always thought we were”. She can’t explain why she started interviewing scientists about the probability and likely consequences of the next pandemic. “But I can say that it didn’t arise from any special oracular powers,” she wrote in her note to booksellers. By the time New York was locked down, the novel’s structure, characters and themes were in place, the first part was finished and the other two were partly written. “Of course, it would occasionally strike me as strange that I was writing about this pandemic in the midst of one, but not terribly,” she says. “And listen, there’s no way to say this without sounding completely heartless, but Covid really gave me a lot of time. It was not an anxious period for me, because I was extremely lucky to have a job that I knew was secure. I had health insurance, I had savings. I had a place to live that was safe. And suddenly, as someone who needs eight or nine hours’ sleep a night, I had time.” After the taxonomical precision of The People in the Trees, where scientific identification and naming is central, and the introversion of A Little Life – in which external history is airbrushed out, leaving no distraction from the agonies and ecstasies of Jude, JB, Willem and Malcolm, over three decades – the bleaching out of identity associated with names in To Paradise is particularly striking. One of the Davids is actually a descendant of Hawaiian royalty, the reluctant centre of a running argument about sovereignty and the appropriation of people and objects. Nor is this anonymity limited to the novel’s characters: in the world of the 19th-century Binghams, there is no word for “gay”, while the diseases that sweep through the later sections are never named. It’s a bold formal move for a writer whose breakout readership is likely to be expecting another agonised circle of friends. For Yanagihara this play with naming represents one of many negotiations with America’s idea of itself. “We’re often renaming things in the United States, either to eradicate a bad memory or to try to dissociate it from a person who history has not treated kindly or who deserves to be treated with more respect. There’s this idea that naming something changes the fundamental nature of it, but does naming who we are make us more real to others? Or is it simply a way of making ourselves more real to ourselves? Above all, To Paradise offers a profound challenge to the idea of democratic society. The very concept of paradise, she says, is that it is not for everyone but for the chosen few. “The idea of sacrifice for a kind of freedom, the idea of personal freedom, as opposed to social freedom, the idea of a freedom for some, but not for all – these are questions that are integral to the founding, and continuation, of America.” The current disarray around management of wave after wave of Covid pandemic bears out her point, giving the novel a shadow that seems to have warped and elongated even in the two months since I first read it. This is particularly true of its chilling representation of a young woman whose independence, and capacity to make adult relationships, have been sacrificed by her doctor grandfather to the task of keeping her alive. Did Yanagihara have any qualms about being seen as playing to the anti-vax gallery? “I didn’t think about it that way,” she says firmly. “My father’s an oncologist. He doesn’t treat children, but there are certain forms of treatment, as I understand it, that save children while really hurting them and causing long-term complications: I was thinking about the sacrifice that Grandfather, and unwittingly Charlie, end up making for her life. He has a much colder and more clinical idea of meaningful life until she gets sick.” For all this book’s differences from Yanagihara’s previous novels, all three have one striking thing in common: they barely touch on the consciousness of women. Rendered infertile and perpetually childlike by the antidote to the virus, Charlie has little agency. Why such an absence? “You know,” says Yanagihara, “after you’ve written your third book, certain patterns and motifs begin to announce themselves that you’re not conscious of. Sometimes they have to do with your biography, but sometimes they don’t. I don’t know why there’s a grandparent in each one of these books, because I wasn’t close to my grandparents. There are no mothers in any of my books, and I’m not sure why, because I have a perfectly fine relationship with my mother. There are very few women and again I’m not really sure why, but there’s always disease and the body falling apart. The short answer is I’m not sure why Charlie is the only woman.” If one were to go down the psychoanalytical route, one could cite the many interviews in which she has spoken extensively of the influence of her father, who – when she displayed an interest in art at the age of 10 – took her to a pathologist’s lab so that she could draw a cadaver. “I was always interested in the disease, not the human,” she told one interviewer. “I always say that my father came from the last generation of quasi-intellectual men who were completely open and saying that they expected one thing from their daughter, and another thing from their wife,” she says now. “I didn’t want to be a wife and a mother, and was probably very dismissive of the lessons my mother had to teach me, which I regret. And so I deliberately never learned how to do certain things like cook or clean. And as a teenager everything seems like such a binary: you would either be at home cooking and cleaning, or you would be out doing what you wanted, and I wanted to be out doing what I wanted.” Yanagihara was born in Los Angeles, one of two children, to a family that had lived in Hawaii for three generations but were not of Hawaiian blood. Her childhood was itinerant, following her father’s jobs across the US, though she spent three high-school years at the private school in Honolulu that Barack Obama had attended a decade earlier. Punahou School was founded on land given to an American missionary called Bingham, whose grandson, an explorer turned US senator, is listed among its famous alumni (all the surnames in the novel, it turns out, are from prominent 19th-century missionary families in Hawaii). Does she feel American? “Yes, 100%,” she says, though she has Japanese ancestry and considers Japan to be “the country of my heart”. Travelling abroad, she admits, disarmingly, “is a process of constant humiliation. I feel very gauche most of the time. This ugly American behaviour which I can see in myself is kind of what people expect. Especially if you are a non-white American, you will never feel more American than that when you go back to the country of your ancestry, as I do to Japan.” In Hawaii, she grew up at the height of the sovereignty movement with parents who were “classic liberal boomers” and favoured the less radical state-within-a-state solution. In the second section of To Paradise, a range of hopelessly naive separatist movements lay claim to the islands. “I hope the book offers no moral judgment about a craving to return to this era in which things seemed simpler and more noble and respectful. It only says something about how hard it is to try to go back, when history is always in the way,” she says. The Bingham house is stuffed with Hawaii artefacts, which become part of a larger conversation about the ethics of protectiveness: or, as she puts it, “who gets to decide what’s best for people and for cultures”. There’s an unflinchingness in Yanagihara’s writing that can seem gratuitously punishing – a reminder of the little girl who was more interested in disease than people. By the third section of To Paradise, Hawaii has been destroyed. In A Little Life, she pushed the torture and self-flagellation of lawyer Jude so far that some readers recoiled while others hung on in horrified fascination. “This book and its champions seem bound to each other by their mutual disgust and discomfort,” wrote Daniel Mendelsohn in the New York Review. “It’s rare to encounter literary discussion of such dissonant zeal, such enthralled distress,” observed the Australian critic Beejay Silcox, in an essay summarising the Little Life phenomenon. How did Yanagihara herself feel about inspiring such strong feelings? “I don’t read anything about my books and I’m not on Twitter, which is, as I understand it, where the majority of these conversations tend to get slugged out,” she says. She is particularly impatient with the #ownvoice movement, which might question her right, as a woman, to tell the stories of gay men. “It’s very dangerous. I have the right to write about whatever I want. The only thing a reader can judge is whether I have done so well or not.” While A Little Life was a dark adolescent fairy story of a group of friends who attempt to hold historical institutional evil at bay by making their own family, To Paradise takes a more history-hardened view of relationships. People always ultimately choose their family over friends, asserts one of the Charleses. Though Yanagihara says that she disagrees with that position, I wonder how much – as someone who is resolutely single and lives alone – her own idea of friendship has altered during the pandemic. “I think if people did live with someone, whether it was their partner, their family, or so on, they almost always prioritised those people over their friends,” she says. Does that mean she personally lost friends? “It led to some meaningful conversations,” she replies, “…and then there were friends who I became much closer to.” She is wearing a chunky gold necklace featuring her star sign, Virgo, given to her by a friend who is the artistic director of a leading couture house. “I don’t have family,” she says, correcting herself a beat later to: “I do, but they’re in Hawaii and they’re fine.” (She spent two Covid summers there, watching the wildlife return to tourist-bare beaches and disappear again as the industry returned.) Her point, she clarifies, is “I think people divided according to grades of fear, and who they had to protect”. It’s hard to imagine how the 47-year-old author manages to combine such a high-profile, jet-setting job with writing such big books, but she says that being the boss has its advantages, as everything works around you. “I’m not the smartest or hardest-working or most educated person, but I am the best at time management,” she says. “It’s a skill that I’ve worked hard to develop, which is not to say that I’m disciplined. I’m not really that disciplined. But once I set aside time for myself, I know how to sit down and use it.” And besides, she adds, journalism has made a valuable contribution to her writing: “It teaches you to be respectful of grammar and spelling, which sounds like a small thing, but really isn’t. It teaches you structure, which I think is an underrated skill. It teaches you how to turn things in on time. And it teaches you that at a certain point, you have to let it go.” After three novels, her project is becoming clear: as Edmund White puts it, she is chronicling her country just as panoramically as Tolstoy did his, with a similar confidence that the story is interesting. “I’ve really thought about how young America is as a nation,” says Yanagihara. “Despite the frustration and despair – even in countries like France, which pretend they don’t care about it – there is such an admiration for America. It’s our vitality, our childlike qualities, you know – our optimism and generosity, but also our spoiltness, our tantrum-throwing, our inwardness, our myopia. I really do think of it as a precocious and quite bratty child, heading into adolescence: every quality that you would admire in that child and every quality that will frustrate you exists within America as well.” The issues to which America is now applying this adolescent brattiness are undeniably global. “The arguments we’re having about vaccine mandates; the ones we’re having about the kinds of sacrifices we might make to effect greater global change and deal with the climate crisis; the ones that involve a reframing of history, especially when it comes to race and immigration. Those questions feel more urgent now because the threat is much more intense, especially when it comes to climate change and disease,” says Yanagihara. They are questions that fiction needs to address, because there are no easy answers in fact. To Paradise is published by Pan Macmillan on 11 January (£20).

1/9/2022,"Movies that have the appearance of being filmed in a single continuous take usually raise two questions. First, is this actually a “one-shot” production (and if not, can you see the joins)? Second, does the format actively benefit the drama or is it merely a gimmick? Alfred Hitchcock famously referred to his experimental 1948 stage-to-screen adaptation of Rope as a “stunt”, and admitted to François Truffaut: “I really don’t know how I came to indulge in it.” More than six decades later, Alejandro González Iñárritu’s wildly overrated 2015 best picture Oscar-winner Birdman felt similarly indulgent – technically dazzling but ultimately hollow. Perhaps the greatest compliment I can pay actor turned director Philip Barantini’s low-budget Brit pic Boiling Point (co-written with James Cummings) is to say that I frequently forgot I was watching a brilliantly orchestrated one-shot film. Not that the format isn’t effective – far from it. It’s utterly immersive, conjuring the raw experience of an inexorably accelerating panic attack. Yet, like the 2015 German thriller Victoria, which was similarly captured in an authentic single take, this is first and foremost a gripping and gritty drama in which the spiralling descent of the narrative is enhanced and enriched by uninterrupted digital photography.  Stephen Graham, who was so brilliant in last year’s BBC mini-series Time, and who gets an executive producer credit here, is on fire as Andy Jones, the already rattled head chef whose world is teetering on the brink of chaos. We first meet him scurrying through the crepuscular streets of London – late for work and ensconced in some on-the-hoof phone pleading that succinctly establishes the collapse of his family life. In the restaurant kitchen where his arrival is overdue, stalwart team leader Carly (Bifa winner Vinette Robinson) and her exasperated colleague Freeman (Ray Panthaki) are holding the fort, something that’s clearly become an increasingly common situation of late – another deftly delivered detail. Andy is overwrought (the Friday-before-Christmas rush is upon them), and swearily takes his stress out on others, his anxiety levels stoked by a visit from a patronisingly pernickety environmental health officer. Meanwhile, out in the restaurant, a rogues gallery of customers must be served. They range from a gaggle of social media influencers who are indulged rather than ejected, to an irate, racist patriarch performatively throwing his weight around on table seven. As for the soon-to-be engaged couple on table 13, they’ve flagged up a nut allergy that needs to be prioritised by the already overworked staff. And then there is Alistair Skye, a celebrity chef to whom Andy is uncomfortably indebted, played with brilliantly passive-aggressive smarm by Jason Flemyng. On the surface, Alistair is all smiles, assuring Andy that “we’re here to support you”, and insisting that he needn’t worry about the feared food critic with whom he has arrived (“You don’t need my endorsement, there’s such a buzz in this place!”). Yet soon enough, Alistair is taking credit for Andy’s menu (“I recognise all these dishes”) and offering smug serving suggestions (“Could I just get a little ramekin dish with some za’atar?”) while making increasingly threatening noises that reveal a deeper, more desperate purpose. Bifa-winning director of photography Matthew Lewis (who also shot the 2019 short from which this feature was born) leads us with superbly unobtrusive skill through this wholly believable hectic world. It’s a world in which everyone has a story, from the nervous young saucier hiding his forearms beneath untucked sleeves, to the game-faced maître d’ weepily phoning her father from the toilets, and the cocky chancer indulging in covert backstreet liaisons by the bins. Subplots about overdue pay increases and overstretched ambitions swirl amid the cacophony of standoffs and service bells (plaudits to the sound team), each thread skilfully interwoven into a complex mosaic of individual voices, all rising to a single scream. The result is a spicy nerve-jangler served with a chargrilled side order of jet-black gallows humour – a divine comedy barrelling towards inevitable tragedy, played out in hell’s kitchen where someone is bound to get burned.

1/9/2022,"As a leading art historian, Christopher Wright has uncovered several old master paintings in public and private collections over five decades. Now he has discovered that a copy of a painting by Sir Anthony van Dyck, which he bought for himself for £65 in 1970, may actually be an original by the 17th-century Flemish court painter to King Charles I. “I bought it from a jobbing dealer in west London,” he said. “I was buying it as a copy, as an art historian. I took no notice of it, in a strange way. The syndrome is the cobbler’s children are the worst shod. So the art historian’s collection is the least looked at.” Wright estimated the painting might be worth around £40,000, although some Van Dycks have fetched seven-figure sums.  The painting, a portrait of Isabella Clara Eugenia, Infanta of Spain and Regentess of the Spanish Netherlands, has been hanging in his sitting room for years. Now, having realised its significance, he wants it to go to a public institution. He is putting it on permanent loan to the Cannon Hall Museum, Barnsley, which boasts a collection of fine 17th-century Dutch and Flemish paintings. Wright’s previous discoveries include a Stubbs portrait in the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull, and his publications include studies of 17th-century artists such as Rembrandt. He looked at the infanta’s portrait more closely only after it caught the eye of a visitor to his home, Colin Harrison, senior curator of European Art at the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. “He comes to see me. We chat. He says, ‘I really think your picture is by Van Dyck,’’’ said Wright. “When you own something, you don’t take any notice of it. It was the sitter’s hands that set it off. That’s what Colin noticed.” Harrison recalled: “In the normal way of a museum curator, Iimmediately was looking around the walls. It seemed to me that this was an interesting and possibly good picture [and] that, if you got the hands right, Van Dyck may very well have painted them.” When buying it, Wright had assumed that it was one of numerous copies of Van Dyck’s infanta portraits in various formats, including full, three-quarter and half-length versions. His is half-length, an oil on canvas measuring 81.5cm by 70.5cm. In each, she appears in a nun’s habit, signalling her mourning and piety after the death of her husband, Archduke Albert VII of Austria, in 1621. She became Regentess of the Netherlands and ruled in her own right until her death in 1633, abandoning the lavish jewellery and clothing in which she had been painted in her younger days. Wright acknowledged that she had been a pious woman, a good administrator and an arts patron, but he never particularly liked the portrait. “My nickname for it was ‘Er Indoors’ after Rumpole of the Bailey. She’s a kind of doom-ridden personality.” But, inspired by Harrison, he took it to the Courtauld Institute of Art in central London, where it has been examined and restored. “It was dirty and had yellow varnish, but it was in decent condition,” he said. “The whole thing looks absolutely magnificent now.” It is thought to date from between 1628 and 1632. Van Dyck had by then worked in England for King James I and as court painter to the infanta and, in 1632, he returned to England, where Charles I appointed him “principalle Paynter” and knighted him. The Courtauld’s report, by Kendall Francis and Timothy McCall, notes that Van Dyck and his workshop produced many such infanta portraits and that it can be “very challenging” to determine the extent to which assistants were involved. They conclude: “The adroit skill leads us to tentatively propose that [it] can be attributed to Van Dyck’s workshop and that it was completed during his lifetime and under his supervision.” Wright noted that, while some believe that the half-length version in the Walker art gallery, Liverpool, is by Van Dyck, “that is not an opinion held by the Walker”, whose online description refers to it as from Van Dyck’s studio and “possibly” the artist. Discussing the qualities of his version, he said: “The hands are beautiful. When it’s a studio execution, the hands, they can’t do them. The structure of the face is right, her clothes are beautifully done. There’s no copyist busy here.”",Arts/Art and design,Art historian discovers that £65 painting on his wall is work of Flemish master ,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/09/art-historian-discovers-that-65-painting-on-his-wall-is-work-of-flemish-master
1/9/2022,"Six matches into a stewardship may seem premature for an inquest unless the club is Manchester United and the manager was brought in to administer a quick fix before a permanent No 1 is hired in the close season. Yet when Aston Villa arrive for Monday’s FA Cup third‑round tie a long week will have passed since the 1-0 capitulation to Wolves at Old Trafford that greatly increased scrutiny of Ralf Rangnick’s interim tenure. Such is the reality for the 63-year-old, who arrived on a much-trumpeted ticket of being a coach whose use of a vaunted high press would whip a listing squad into shape. Except the intense closing‑down game seen during his opening match – a win over Crystal Palace – has since vanished, causing some to venture that Rangnick’s “godfather of gegenpress” tag may be one of football’s great misnomers.  If this is confusing so, too, is the picture offered by those at United about the German’s nascent regime and the squad’s reaction to it. Rangnick, according to one international, knows precisely what he is doing and is admired for a structured tactical approach. Other senior players, having experienced Chris Armas’s coaching, are unimpressed by the former New York Red Bulls and Toronto FC manager appointed as his assistant by Rangnick, whose thinking and decision making are consequently being questioned. But while there are strong claims that the German’s training methods are causing some discontent, a few are hardly enamoured of Cristiano Ronaldo. Since his arrival in the summer, Ronaldo’s presence can be seen as a boon for United’s emerging talent due to positive interactions with junior squad members. Others, despite his 14 goals, see him as an aloof signing who illuminates the executive’s muddled thinking. If there are grumbles about Ronaldo’s static play, there is also confidence that Rangnick possesses the backbone to drop United’s superstar forward if he decides that is required. This swirl of contrasting opinions would not matter if United were sailing serenely along, giving Manchester City the run for their petrodollar Liverpool and Chelsea are currently unable to do and challenging for a 21st championship. But they have not really been in position to do so in the nine years since Sir Alex Ferguson retired and it is certain to reach a decade, at least, before another title is secured. Instead, before Thursday’s announcement that Ed Woodward’s troubled time as United’s most powerful executive will end on 1 February, the man he signed to be a mid-season Mr Fixit has already reached a juncture where he is conceding his players “didn’t at all” employ the press against Wolves because they were unable to occupy the positions to do so. Rangnick’s admission is particularly mystifying given it casts a coach five decades into the high press as being unable to drill it into a talented group. Ronaldo’s ageing legs suggest he might be a fall guy in the efforts to make United an energised, harrying side, but Mason Greenwood, whose five goals make him United’s joint-second highest scorer with Bruno Fernandes, is among those now considered expendable instead. Against Wolves, Greenwood was the sole outfield player who performed to the Rangnick blueprint. Yet the 20-year-old was substituted on the hour, a jarring moment that provoked further questions regarding the manager’s reputation for being a clear-eyed watcher of players. Greenwood’s whirring feet, menacing passes and ability to close down fast appeared an ideal fit for Rangnick. When asked why Greenwood had lasted barely an hour he replied: “His effort and performance was not outstanding but he was one of the better players today.” Rangnick chose not to replace the faltering Jadon Sancho, the other “No 10” in his 4-2-2-2. That formation had, before the Wolves game, enabled his side to go five matches unbeaten – which is good – but has not allowed his proposed style to prosper – which is not so good. Rangnick has demanded more consistency from Greenwood and said the youngster still needs to develop physically. If the latter part is a job for the club’s sports science department, the former is tricky if you are being substituted when performing close to your best. Defeat Villa and the noise around United may well quieten but elimination from the one competition United can still realistically claim and the volume will be turned up.",Sport/Football,Pressing problems a real headache for Ralf Rangnick at Manchester United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/09/pressing-problems-a-real-headache-for-ralf-rangnick-at-manchester-united
1/9/2022,"It was Roger Federer who first coined the term “Happy Slam” to describe the Australian Open – a phrase that perfectly encapsulated the first grand slam of the year, a time when the players are feeling fresh and simply happy to be there. For those coming from the European winter the warm sunshine offers rejuvenation, mentally and physically, while the players have also been well treated by Tennis Australia, particularly over the past 15 years or so since Craig Tiley became the tournament director.  It was Tiley who introduced a blanket payment of $1,000 to every player in the main draw, singles and doubles, which was strongly appreciated by those further down the rankings who made the long trip to Australia knowing that their first-round loser’s cheque would probably barely cover the expense. In 2018, Tiley pledged to eventually raise the prize money from its figure of Aus $55m to Aus $100m, which would put the Australian Open above the other three grand slams. (This year, it is Aus $75m.) The players love Melbourne’s restaurants, they love the climate and everything about it. The facilities, vastly improved over the past decade, are second to none, including three covered courts as well as outstanding gym and recovery rooms. But as Novak Djokovic sits in his quarantine hotel in Melbourne, awaiting Monday’s appeal against the rejection of his visa – for not providing sufficient evidence that he merited an exemption from the country’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate – things don’t quite seem quite so happy any more. While the Happy Slam has been enjoyable for players to play and for journalists, broadcasters and fans to attend, things have changed. Rose-tinted glasses may be in play here, but many who covered the event in the 1980s and 1990s will tell you how officials have been more officious, how flexibility has been replaced by rigidity. Rules are rules. It has hardly been without its share of controversy. In the past 16 years, the Australian Open has endured at least two strike threats (with Djokovic as a key figure) as well as failed drug tests, natural disasters, homophobia and match-fixing. In 2005, the buildup was dominated by a drugs scandal, sparked by the Belgian sports minister, Claude Eerdekens, who announced that women’s US Open champion at the time, Svetlana Kuznetsova, had tested positive for ephedrine at an exhibition event in Belgium. Journalists landing in Melbourne joined local reporters in chasing the story for three days and though the Russian, who said she had been prescribed a cold remedy that might have caused the failed test, escaped a sanction because ephedrine was only banned in competition, it set things off on a dark note. The Australian Open’s slot in the calendar, held in the second half of January, may be one reason why it attracts controversy. By the time players arrive it is more than four months since the end of the US Open, the last time they have all been in the same place. The ATP and WTA hold player meetings on the eve of the event and that timing can often lead to explosive moments. In 2012, tensions were high at the US Open over prize money, in particular the percentage of revenue that was given to players. A strike threat – aimed at the 2013 Australian Open – was averted after Federer and Djokovic led the negotiations with the grand slam tournaments. In 2018, the threat of a strike reared its head again, this time in Australia, when Djokovic led calls for a vast increase in prize money. The Serb said he wanted to spread the wealth further down the rankings, while he also threatened to form a breakaway union to have an independent body that represents players alone. The threat was averted when Tiley promised to increase the prize money. Djokovic later followed through with the formation of the Professional Tennis Players Association (PTPA) in September 2020, though it remains in its formative stages. Even Australia’s heroes have not always helped. Margaret Court, a legend of Australian tennis on the court and the holder of a record 24 singles grand slam titles, has long been a polarising figure thanks to her vocal stance against gay rights. Her name still adorns the Margaret Court Arena but in 2018 there was an embarrassing moment for Tennis Australia when Billie Jean King, invited to Melbourne to receive the inaugural Australian Open woman of the year award, said Court’s name should be removed. “It’s really important if you’re going to have a name on anything that you’re hospitable, you’re inclusive, that you open your arms to everyone who comes to a public facility,” she said, as it slowly dawned on Tennis Australia officials what might be about to go down. “I was fine until lately when she said so many derogatory things about my community, about the LBGT. That really went deep in my heart and soul. I don’t think she should have [her name on it] any more.” In 2016, a match-fixing scandal broke on the eve of the event. In 2020, devastating bushfires threatened the Australian Open before clearing just in time and last year, the event was held in a pandemic thanks to incredible efforts from all concerned. As Djokovic awaits his fate, he may just wonder what happened to the Happy Slam.",Sport/Sport,From strike threats to bushfires: how Australia’s ‘Happy Slam’ lost its cheer ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/09/from-strike-threats-to-bushfires-how-australian-open-happy-slam-lost-its-cheer
1/9/2022,"In the spring of 2020, Hart Island, a mile from City Island in the Bronx, was a focal point of grief in New York. It was here, at the city’s public cemetery or potter’s field, the final resting place of more than a million people, that officials ordered trenches dug to accommodate those the coronavirus was expected to kill.  The trenches were never filled. Many bodies were returned to funeral parlors or stored in mobile freezers on Randall’s Island, better known for music festivals and the Frieze art fair than cold storage of corpses. Last week, as New York was once again in the grip of a pandemic spike, the ferry jetty was devoid of morbid feelings, even with infections running at a 35% positivity rate, close to five times the peak of last winter. “We haven’t seen anyone here – or any of the trucks coming like they used to,” said one Hart Island worker. The winter Covid wave has hit the Bronx hard. The borough has the city’s highest positivity rate, in some neighborhoods near 50%. But for many this wave feels different, not least in the way leaders and health officials are treating it. Last week, Governor Kathy Hochul ordered hospitals to start reporting numbers of patients being treated for symptoms of Covid-19 separately from those who test positive after being admitted for other reasons. The general sense of weariness – and wariness – around official guidance may have reached a breaking point when the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that quarantine times for anyone testing positive would be cut from 10 days to five – guidance interpreted by many to mean that Omicron was milder than its predecessors. In New York the number of hospital admissions is similar to the peak in April 2020 – 11,000 – but fives times more people are being found to have the virus. Stays in hospital, at least for the vaccinated, are shorter. The virus is still causing havoc. The state reported 130 deaths on Thursday, the highest single-day toll since the vaccination rollout. New York City has reported service suspended on three of 22 subway lines and reduced on others, because 21% of operators and conductors are sick. In the most recent figures, 21% of the NYPD was out, as were 30% of emergency medical service personnel and 17% of fire officials. But under new mayor Eric Adams and Hochul, the message is different from former governor Andrew Cuomo’s “New York tough” message or that of Bill de Blasio, the former mayor who ordered a million public school students into remote learning for more than a year. Adams said plan A was for classes to remain in person. The city, he said, had put 1m Covid tests in schools. “The safest place for a child is in school,” Adams said – scaring many parents, especially those with children too young to be vaccinated. Fifteen miles south of the Bronx, in lower Manhattan, some said Covid was losing some of its power. “People are doing what they need to do to stay safe,” said Courtney McCleskey. “This seems like the new normal.” Visiting from Georgia, she said she planned to attend Broadway musicals on three consecutive nights, even as many stages have been forced to close by cast and crew infections. Charley Bailey, also visiting from the south, said New Yorkers seemed more adapted to masking and vaccine requirements. “It’s seems like people are taking it way more seriously than they do in east Tennessee, where getting people to wear masks is impossible. People here seem much more agreeable to protecting to each other.” Others said that after the CDC cut quarantine in half, they stopped taking government directives so seriously. “The reality is that everyone is fatigued by the pandemic, and at this point everyone knows they should be doing what they can to stay safe. But at this point we’re in a ‘fuck it’ phase,” said Ben Martin, visiting from Boston. On Friday, CDC director Rochelle Walensky said she would assume greater control over messaging.To Yascha Mounk, a professor at Johns Hopkins University, one measure of when a pandemic ends is when people become accustomed to it. “By that definition, the massive surge of Omicron infections coursing through scores of developed countries without eliciting more than a half-hearted response marks the end of the pandemic,” Mounk wrote in the Atlantic. Politicians are singing a similar tune, with a back-to-normal message subject to masking and vaccination. “We are refining everything, our whole quarantine idea,” Hochul said. “Everyone was staying home for 10 days; they might be asymptomatic for five days and still have five days, which was paralyzing to our economy. Staying at home is widely disruptive. We can’t do that. That is as disruptive as saying stay remote.” Adams has said it is his priority to get New Yorkers back to work, proposing a three-day office week, expanding to five. “Covid is here. We have to learn to live with it in a smart way,” Adams said.The issue, the mayor said, is that 30% office occupancy cannot sustain businesses. Restaurants which boomed in the fall are now emptying again. Having survived the first, crippling phases of the pandemic, they are seeing business dry up. At Pardon My French, a restaurant in the East Village, business was good from March to December. Just before the holidays, it dried up. “Discussions always become about Covid but there are so many other things touching people’s lives way more profoundly,” said owner Valentin Leleu. New York is a long way from March 2020, when the city was in the grip of a paralyzing fear, residents haunted by a near constant wail of sirens. But the city is not normal either, despite many residents’ efforts. At Lovely Day in Nolita, owner Kazusa Jibiki said that combined with rising overheads, Omicron was a cruel blow. “We are concerned how we’ll survive if this lasts,” he said.",News/US news,Omicron drives Covid surge but New York a long way from pandemic’s early days,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/09/new-york-omicron-coronavirus-covid-pandemic
1/9/2022,"Climate justice is the theme of this year’s Guardian and Observer charity appeal and with a week to go we have so far raised more than £725,000 for four environment charities: Practical Action, Global Greengrants Fund UK, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, and Environmental Justice Foundation. Nearly 7,000 readers have already donated. Here, they tell us why.  Pam MacLeod, 79, TruroPam MacLeod was motivated to donate to this year’s appeal because she and her family have been directly affected by the climate crisis. She grew up in southern Africa and while at school in Zimbabwe in the 1950s she witnessed the consequences of drought. The memory of that time has remained with her. She says: “My older brother still lives in southern Africa and he sees effects of a lack of rain which is increasingly a problem. My other brother lives in California. Last year, he and his wife were told to leave home because the wildfires had got so close.” Her son lives in British Columbia, in Canada where he works as a nurse practitioner. The clinic where he’s based is in an area that has been badly affected by flooding. “He’s been very aware of the effects of flooding on the lives of his patients,” adds MacLeod. “The necessity for doing something about climate change is absolutely pre-eminent in our thinking. It was an obvious choice [to donate to this year’s appeal] for me.” Jennifer Labwo, 29, east London“Climate change underpins everything,” says Labwo. “It is the single most important issue that we face. She says that without tackling the climate crisis, it is impossible to get justice for other social problems. “It’s all interconnected,” she adds. Without seeking redress to climate justice, we can’t spur self-determination for women in the global south because they’re concerned about accessing resources like clean water. “We can’t begin to talk about a post-racialised society when we [in the west] are actively propping up our lifestyles on the backs of people in the global south.”We can’t talk about creating an equitable society for disabled people because we’re not taking their needs into consideration.” Margaret Turner, 82, ExeterIn November, Margaret Turner, who belongs to Exeter’s Extinction Rebellion, went to Glasgow to attend the second week of Cop26. There, she heard speakers from Nigeria and Brazil, among others. She says: “I was impressed by their awareness, commitment and knowledge regarding their own part of the Earth. “I believe that we in the rich nations should support those who know better than we do how to take care of their own land and environment – this charitable appeal works by giving more agency to these people to care for the Earth.” Clive Quick, HuntingdonFor Clive Quick, the appeal was a chance to donate to Practical Action – a charity whose work he has been supporting and following for decades. Quick, a retired surgeon, has taught in Africa and Sri Lanka, and has witnessed how some people are desperately trying to make a living. “[Practical Action] starts at the bottom rather than at the top,” he says. “It helps people to help themselves.” “Having seen the effects of climate change I can see that what they’re trying to achieve is beneficial in that respect. They help people cope with what they’ve got, rather than what they might have,” he says. Quick has seen some of the work Practical Action has done in Nepal and Peru, among other countries, and credits it with enabling people to achieve amazing results. Dede Liss, 67, Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire“I feel strongly that the west and northern countries owe a debt to people in the global south because we’re responsible for the climate change that is happening,” says Liss. She feels that although the UK government should take more responsibility and action, individuals can also play a role. “I do feel people have an individual responsibility.

1/9/2022,"Those shining orbs, the Golden Globe awards, have well and truly lost their lustre. Unloved and almost unattended, the prize-giving ceremony that once promised more Hollywood entertainment value than any other, with closeups of tipsy stars in unguarded moments, will not even be screened on network TV. Its demotion follows a series of rows over its dubious practices and lack of diversity. Yet the event at the Beverly Hilton hotel comes as Hollywood tries to cling on by its glistening fingernails to all the traditional allure and hoopla of the awards season. After two years of film-making against a background of Covid infections and international restrictions, the industry sorely needs to keep up the illusion of glamour and fun that helps to bankroll its biggest productions.  Despite efforts to quickly reconfigure the nomination and voting processes behind the awards and to emphasise its philanthropic arm, the 2022 globes are likely to make a fairly lame first outing, with no red-carpet buildup or even a livestream. As campaigner Melissa Silverstein, founder and publisher of Women in Hollywood, told the Observer this weekend: “If an award is handed out alone in a forest, with nobody looking, did it really happen at all?” Silverstein, who also directs the Athena film festival, added: “The Globes were always the awards where the nominees would be a little drunk by the time they got up for their awards and people would turn up to enjoy themselves, but they have really fallen away this year. They can’t get anybody to go to it. “It’s sad, but they deserved it as they treated people horribly. When women actors were put up in front of the press in the past they had to answer questions about their babies and their personal lives. The awards organisers felt they had all the power. Shame on everybody, though, for letting it go on for so long. I’m sure many nominees will be relieved they don’t have to go through that any more.” The awards are run by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), which was last year called to account for its ethical failings and failure to reflect the wider film world, as well as answer questions about its finances. In 2019 none of the 87 members was black and the recruitmane of 21 more to improve diversity has been dismissed as tokenism. These claims, echoed by stars such as Scarlett Johansson, who refused to take part in their events claiming that “sexist questions” from members “bordered on sexual harassment” and Tom Cruise who returned his three awards, led to boycotts from most of the leading public relations firms with which the HFPA was once hand-in-satin-glove. None of the industry magazines is promoting the event this year, NBC has pulled out of a broadcast arrangement, and A-list stars have refused to attend. “The Globes have been the big loser of the season,” said Jeremy Kay, US editor of Screen Daily. “For months, the HFPA has been furiously issuing press releases to show it’s undergoing fundamental structural change to course-correct, bring in new membership and ingratiate itself with Hollywood, but it got the cold shoulder. The Globes nominations passed by with little fanfare and it is hard to see tonight’s ceremony registering anything like the level of interest it has enjoyed over the years. Its influence on the Oscar season seems negligible.” It is possible, though, that this reversal of fortunes has had the accidental effect of modernising the Globes and making them more suited to our sombre, mid-pandemic era. Critic Robbie Collin suggested last week in the Telegraph that their low-key look would be more apt: short on pizazz, short on self-congratulation, and, most importantly he seems to feel, just plain short. Yet the annual awards season is a key component of the marketing machine in Los Angeles, and organisers of the Critics Choice awards were hoping to benefit from the Globes’ loss of status this time around. The Critics Choice ceremony was also due to take place this month but a fresh surge in Omicron cases has seen it postponed. So maybe it is now the Baftas, held in London on 13 March, that has the best chance of attracting attention before the Oscars on 27 March. The British academy has already undergone its own hefty shake-up and self-examination, following recent accusations that female directors and black artists were under-represented. It will also inevitably gain kudos this spring from the number of British actors winning plaudits. Among them are Olivia Colman, for The Lost Daughter, Benedict Cumberbatch, for Jane Campion’s The Power of the Dog, and Kenneth Branagh, for Belfast, starring Jamie Dornan and Ciarán Hinds. Each is in the running for a string of prizes, potentially culminating in golden statuettes at the ceremony that still outshines them all. “Despite an ongoing decline in the TV audience for the Oscars telecast, the show remains the pinnacle of the US awards season,” said Kay. “But there’s also now a lot of love for other events, like the indie-skewing Spirit awards in Santa Monica, scheduled to take place in early March, and for last November’s Gotham awards in New York.” For Silverstein all the jockeying for prominence between the awards is an unwelcome distraction: “I hope the really big story will also be noticed; the fact we could have a woman, Jane Campion, winning the Oscar for directing twice. If that happens it would also be the second year running it goes to a woman. And her cinematographer is a woman too. That would be monumental.” But the thirst for red carpet footage of women in frocks, she knows, will not go away. “It’s because of the pressure for eyeballs. The television networks are very worried about the disconnect between the films that make money at the box office and those that win awards.” Silverstein argues that audiences can find quality content without any emphasis on glamour and high heels. The achievements of women behind the camera, as well as in front, should be marked, before the film industry then concentrates on opening its doors to a wider group of people and on moving away from the financial imperatives that drive a conveyor belt of action and superhero films. “I’m really hoping to see a change in the way we define a successful film now. You really can make a profitable film without having a big budget. If you make any money, then you’ve had a successful film. So how do we de-couple the movie industry from this expectation of really big profits?” Whether the tarnished Golden Globes can be buffed-up again next yearto help with this shift in perspective remains in doubt. “It’s too soon to say whether the HFPA will be embraced and welcomed back into the awards community next season,” said Kay. “At a time when content creators and actors from under-represented communities have been making their voices heard, Hollywood finally is very publicly moving to a place where any whiff of inequity will no longer be tolerated. “Over the past five years or so diversity has become the watchword and the industry has been vocal in wanting to embrace change. You see it in awards season and in the reporting of awards season, where outlets are quick to tot up how many women or people of colour, for example, are among nominees and winners. The Gotham awards recently announced their first gender-neutral winners in acting categories and I wouldn’t be surprised if other groups follow suit in future and we see new, ‘woke’ awards shows spring up.”",Arts/Film,Golden Globes lose their shine as A-listers shun ‘unethical’ ceremony,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/09/golden-globes-lose-their-shine-as-a-listers-shun-unethical-ceremony
1/9/2022,"France is both beautiful and brutally bleak. It is a country studded with towns and rural vistas that take your breath away, but pockmarked with districts of soulless, desolate concrete, especially in the suburbs of its cities, the banlieues. It’s as though French planners and architects, in their embrace of modernity, lost touch with what it means to be human. It has been an important trigger for a toxic brew of Islamophobia and wider cultural despair. The political consequences, now playing themselves out, will ricochet around Europe and the west. The presidential elections this spring will be dominated by the right, overtly mouthing implacable opposition to immigration that even Nigel Farage, who shares similar sentiments, dares not use so openly in Britain.  French socialism has collapsed before the onslaught, while the mainstream right candidate – Valérie Pécresse – is compelled to shore up her position by echoing the same tropes. The pace is being set by presidential candidate and TV celebrity Éric Zemmour, who burst on to the scene last autumn. He is a hardline Islamophobe who argues that France is about to be overrun by Islam, dignified as “the great replacement”. He is joined by the longstanding representative of the nativist right, Marine Le Pen, who has been saying similar things, echoing her father, for years. Extraordinarily, together they command just over 30% of opinion poll support. President Emmanuel Macron, seen only five years ago as representing a new, self-confident majoritarian blend of liberal social democracy and liberal conservatism, is only just ahead of them both, polling around 24%. It is hardly a ringing endorsement of his years in office or his aim to transcend left and right. Macron may have governed competently, but the abolition of the wealth tax and an attempt to create more consensual trade unions have trashed whatever reputation he had on the left, while on the right he is seen to temporise too much on immigration, asylum and Islam. France is home to Europe’s biggest Muslim population, but many French people think Islamic values are incompatible with core French values – notably laïcité, born of the 1789 revolution, that religion should be kept out of public and cultural life, to which a fading Catholicism presents no threat. Islam should fade too. French Muslims, for their part, are disproportionately crowded into the soulless concrete jungles of the banlieues – marginalised, segregated and isolated into what the former prime minister Manuel Valls called “territorial, social and ethical apartheid”. Add to the mix the fallout from the rise of militant Islam in the Middle East and there is the perfect recipe for a dark, vicious circle of marginalisation that is feeding Muslim extremism. Macron has found himself impossibly squeezed. No extra powers to deport, to investigate, to arrest, to attempt to assimilate before this evident threat are enough for the Islamophobes. Speeches proclaiming faith in republican western values seem beside the point. And all against a wider sense that France is in decline. It is potent material for ideologues. Terrorism has risen exponentially – the fastest rise of any country in Europe. France arrests four times more Islamic suspects than any other country in Europe, according to the Institute of Economics and Peace. At the last count, 47,000 out of a prison population of 67,000 were Muslim. The unemployment rate of 14% among Muslims is almost twice the national rate. France’s political and media culture exacerbates the problems. Zemmour made his name on cheap chat shows on the multiplicity of tiny TV stations that screen current affairs discussion as inflammatory infotainment; think a plethora of GB News channels, only worse. An electoral system organised around presidentialism, with a first and second round of voting, encourages a figure such as Zemmour to build a personality cult, just as Macron himself did in 2017. Macron created En Marche. Zemmour has created Reconquête. It is sheer racist poison. Reconquête is so named to “reconquer” a France at risk of being “overwhelmed” by Muslims. Zemmour celebrates the “great leader” doctrine of history, a France led by Napoleon, Joan of Arc and de Gaulle. The country now needs another great leader – not the weird centrist Macron but passionate Zemmour – to recover its lost greatness, but based on racial and cultural purity. Assimilation should be complete, down to changing forenames. Immigration should cease. All welfare support and budgetary aid for anything foreign should stop. Free trade is anathema. He would freeze relations with the EU and pursue an independent foreign policy. Only the disaster of Brexit has checked the ambition for a “Frexit”, once pushed by Marine Le Pen. Somehow, the politics of tolerance and of mutual respect have to surface, and triumph, otherwise western democracies, with their multiracial populations, are in real trouble. Macron’s compromised decency and competence are of course preferable to the politics of hate and exclusion that can only lock France – and Britain, if it were in any way repeated here – into a self-fulfilling vortex. Aid to Europe, France and even Britain is coming unexpectedly from the unfolding, self-defeating debacle of Brexit, driven by parallel anti-immigrant instincts morphing into near racism. Without its grim warning, Zemmour and Le Pen’s grip on French politics, even if they lose to Macron or his probable rightwing challenger Pécresse, might undermine France as a pillar of the EU. As it is, the threat remains all too real. Equally, in post-Brexit Britain, opinion polls show some softening in anti-immigration views. We may live in rightwing times, but one of the right’s greatest triumphs – Brexit – may prove to be the trigger for a rebirth of a better, less hateful politics. Pray Macron, battered perhaps, survives.
