3/17/2022,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Federal officials confirmed Wednesday that the U.S. Department of Justice has reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with the families of most of those killed or wounded in a 2018 Florida high school massacre over the FBI's failure to stop the gunman even though it had received information he intended to attack. Attorneys for 16 of the 17 killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland and some of those wounded previously announced in November that they had reached a monetary settlement with the government over the FBI's failure to investigate a tip it received about a month before the massacre. The 17th family chose not to sue. The government's announcement Wednesday said the settlement resolves 40 cases connected to the shooting for $127.5 million. The settlement does not amount to an admission of fault by the United States, according to a Justice Department news release. About five weeks before the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting, an FBI tip line received a call saying a former Stoneman Douglas student, Nikolas Cruz, had bought guns and planned to ""slip into a school and start shooting the place up.” “I know he's going to explode,” the caller told the FBI. But that information was never forwarded to the FBI's South Florida office and Cruz was never contacted. He had been expelled from the school a year earlier and had a long history of emotional and behavioral problems. Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty last October to 17 counts of first-degree murder. He will receive either a death sentence or life in prison after a penalty trial that is scheduled to start in April.",U.S./Associated Press,Florida massacre families to get millions for FBI's inaction,https://news.yahoo.com/florida-massacre-families-millions-fbis-222317418.html
3/17/2022,"The mystery munitions are decoys meant to trick air-defense radars and heat-seeking missiles. They are each about a foot long and shaped like a dart with an orange tail, American intelligence officials say. One expert called the discovery of these decoys an ""intelligence bonanza"" for the West. Russia has deployed a mystery munition in Ukraine that's stumped ballistic experts. The munitions are decoys meant to trick air-defense radars and heat-seeking missiles, the New York Times reported, and are released from Iskander-M short-range ballistic missiles. They are each about a foot long and shaped like a dart with an orange tail, American intelligence officials say. The devices produce radio signals to confuse enemy radars attempting to locate the missiles, and they also contain a heat source to attract other missiles. Experts were confused by the munitions, which began circulating on social media a few weeks ago, many mistaking them for bomblets from cluster weapons, reported the Times' John Ismay, a US Navy veteran who was qualified in explosive ordnance disposal. They are similar to Cold War-era decoys known as ""penetration aids"" that were designed to bypass antimissile systems in order to reach their targets. The Iskander is a short-range ballistic missile system developed soon after the fall of the Soviet Union and has a range of more than 400km, or roughly 250 miles. Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, called the discovery of these munitions an ""intelligence bonanza"" for the West. He said it is rare to see technical information about adversaries' ballistic countermeasures, as their effectiveness is drastically reduced when their secrecy is compromised. ""Decoys like this can be effective in terms of fooling radars or infrared seekers on kill vehicles, but they need to be kept secret,"" Lewis told Insider. ""Because if your adversary or if the defender has access to the countermeasures, then they can adapt their missile defense systems so that they're not fooled."" To Lewis, it's a puzzle why Russia would use these decoys against Ukraine, which he says does not have the military capabilities to successfully shoot down Iskander missiles. ""It's a very curious decision by the Russians,"" he said. ""In using missiles with these decoys, they're really compromising their own ability to defeat much more sophisticated missile defenses that the United States and other NATO countries might use.""

3/17/2022,"Have you seen the tanker ship anchored just north of the Pell Bridge with the big ""Z"" freshly painted on its smokestack? Those who are up on current events know that ""Z"" has become a symbol for those who support Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A lot of people have taken to Facebook and Twitter and elsewhere online to wonder about the 600-foot oil tanker, called Galassis, parked in Rhode Island waters. One of them is Mike Ritz, executive director of Leadership Rhode Island, who was alerted to the vessel's presence by a professor at the Naval War College who had gone through Leadership RI's program. ""Well, what's going on with that?"" Ritz asked The Providence Journal in an interview Wednesday, after emailing the paper about the ship. ""The port authority could refuse [to let] it dock if it's really a Russian ship."" ""Should we meet at the tavern?"" Ritz asked. He was referring to Sabin Tavern, in Providence, where Colonial Rhode Islanders plotted how to welcome another ship to Narragansett Bay: the British customs schooner Gaspee, which, of course, they burned to the waterline in 1772. Before you grab your pitchfork, though, a few additional facts: The Galissas, which has been in Narragansett Bay about two weeks now, is Greek, not Russian. And the freshly painted ""Z""? It's the corporate logo of the ship's owner, Zeus Lines Management, which recently acquired the tanker. While an exact date of sale couldn't be confirmed immediately, it's so recent that online ship-tracking services still list its previous owner: Benetech Shipping, also a Greek company.
