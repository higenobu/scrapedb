3/20/2022,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China stands on the right side of history over the Ukraine crisis as time will tell, and its position is in line with the wishes of most countries, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said. ""China will never accept any external coercion or pressure, and opposes any unfounded accusations and suspicious against China,"" Wang told reporters on Saturday evening, according to a statement published by his ministry on Sunday. Wang's comments came after U.S. President Joe Biden warned his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, on Friday of ""consequences"" if Beijing gave material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. During the video call, Xi told Biden the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible and called on NATO nations to hold a dialogue with Moscow. He did not, however, assign blame to Russia, according to Beijing's statements about the call. Wang said the most important message Xi sent was that China has always been a force for maintaining world peace. ""We have always stood for maintaining peace and opposing war,"" Wang said, reiterating that China will make independent judgements. ""China's position is objective and fair, and is in line with the wishes of most countries. Time will prove that China's claims are on the right side of history."" Also on Saturday, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said that sanctions imposed by Western nations on Russia over Ukraine were increasingly ""outrageous"". The United States and its European and Asian allies have imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia for the Feb. 24 invasion of its neighbour, which they call a war of aggression by President Vladimir Putin. He says he launched a ""special operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. While saying it recognises Ukraine's sovereignty, Beijing has repeatedly said that Russia has legitimate security concerns that should be addressed and urged a diplomatic solution to the conflict.

3/20/2022,"President Biden and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke for nearly two hours on Friday to discuss Russia's unprompted invasoin of Ukraine, CNBC reports. The strategic conversation ""was seen as a critical test of whether Biden can convince China to stay on the sidelines of the conflict in Ukraine, and to turn down Russian requests for military or economic aid,"" CNBC writes. Here's what we know about the conversation so far. The White House has not yet issued a formal readout of the call, but did note the conversation began after 9 a.m. and lasted just under two hours — ""an unusually long time for a presidential call with the leader of a U.S. adversary,"" CNBC notes. According to a summary of the conversation from the Chinese, however, Xi reportedly told Biden that both the U.S. and China had an obligation to promote peace between Russia and Ukraine. ""The world is neither peaceful nor tranquil,"" the Chinese leader is said to have told Biden, per CNBC, and ""the Ukraine crisis is not something we want to see."" Xi also reportedly told the president that, as economic behemoths, both the U.S. and China ""must not only lead the development of China-US relations on the right track, but also shoulder our due international responsibilities and make efforts for world peace and tranquility,"" per the Chinese summary of the call. Beijing has thus far refused to explicitly condemn Russia's actions against Ukraine, but is still calling for a diplomatic solution to the crisis, Reuters writes. The Biden administration previously warned China not to aid Russia in the war.

3/20/2022,"Russian cosmonauts were wearing yellow suits with blue accents when they boarded the ISS Friday. Many people online assumed the suits were meant as a show of support for Ukraine. But it's unclear if the suits were intended as a political statement. Russian cosmonauts boarding the International Space Station on Friday were wearing yellow and blue — the colors of the Ukrainian flag that many have been using to show support for the nation as it faces a Russian invasion. Some assumed the cosmonauts – Oleg Artemyev, Denis Matveev, and Sergey Korsakov – were showing solidarity with Ukraine, but it's unclear if that's the case. —Eric Berger (@SciGuySpace) March 18, 2022 The cosmonauts launched from a facility in Kazakhstan Friday evening and arrived at the ISS three hours later, the Associated Press reported. They were the first new arrivals to the ISS since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24. Multiple former NASA astronauts, including Scott Kelly and Terry Virts, tweeted about the yellow suits with blue accents, assuming they were intended as a show of support for Ukraine. —Scott Kelly (@StationCDRKelly) March 18, 2022 —Terry Virts (@AstroTerry) March 18, 2022 But the cosmonauts themselves did not say anything that implied the suits were a political statement. After boarding the space station and making a video call back down to earth, Artemyev was asked about the suits during a broadcast aired by Roscosmos, Russia's government space program. ""It became our turn to pick a color. But, in fact, we had accumulated a lot of yellow material so we needed to use it,"" he said, according to AP. ""So that's why we had to wear yellow."" Eric Berger, a space reporter at Ars Technica, said the spacesuits are typically picked out and packed months before a mission, but that it was possible the cosmonauts smuggled them on. Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics, noted that yellow and blue are also the colors used by Bauman University in Moscow, which all three cosmonauts attended. —Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) March 18, 2022 The cosmonauts will spend six and half months on the space station, where they joined two other Russian cosmonauts, four NASA astronauts, and one German astronaut with the European Space Agency.

3/20/2022,"Marie Yovanovitch wrote that she lost her appetite while watching Trump's 2018 presser with Putin. It was ""a spectacle that left observers pondering the depths to which Trump had sunk,"" she wrote. ""God only knows what Trump said"" to Putin in private, the former Ukraine ambassador wrote. The US's former ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, writes in her new book that she lost her appetite and couldn't finish her french fries while watching then President Donald Trump's joint press conference with Russian leader Vladimir Putin in 2018. Yovanovitch was serving as the US's ambassador to Ukraine when Trump and Putin held a bilateral summit in Helsinki in 2018. At the time, she writes in her memoir, ""Lessons From the Edge,"" the US Navy was conducting maritime exercises with Ukraine in a show of solidarity against Russia's aggression. ""It was quite a show, and as I watched the display of US sea power and leadership ... I was proud to be an American,"" the book says. But the same day, Trump held ""what turned out to be a disastrous meeting with President Putin in Helsinki,"" she continues. ""The summit wrapped up with a joint press conference between the two leaders, a spectacle that left observers pondering the depths to which Trump had sunk in his pandering to Putin."" ""I watched the infamous Trump-Putin press conference at my Odesa hotel that evening while pecking at room-service french fries,"" the book says. ""I quickly lost my appetite as I saw our president toady up to Putin and take the Russian's word over that of our own intelligence agencies, which assessed that Russia had interfered in the 2016 US presidential election."" Trump's presser with Putin shocked US allies and provoked severe backlash from national security and foreign policy experts, and even some of Trump's own supporters. Among other things, he said he didn't ""see any reason"" why Russia would have meddled in the 2016 election. When asked whether he believed the US intelligence community or Putin, Trump said Putin was ""extremely strong and powerful in his denial."" Trump also recycled nonsense conspiracy theories about the FBI and the Democratic National Committee, and refused to say he supported the findings of US officials over the Russian leader's claims. And those statements were ""what was said publicly,"" Yovanovitch writes in her memoir. ""God only knows what Trump said in the two-hour one-on-one meeting with Putin, a meeting unusual not only for its length but because Trump did not brief US officials on the discussion later. That raised all sorts of questions."" After being roundly criticized for his handling of the press conference, Trump read from a written statement, saying that he misspoke when he said he didn't see why Russia would have interfered in the 2016 election. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said he had ""full faith"" in US intelligence agencies and wanted to clarify his statements from the bilateral summit. ""I've said this many times,"" Trump said, reading from the written statement. ""I accept our intelligence community's conclusion that Russia's meddling in the 2016 election took place. Could be other people also. There's a lot of people out there."" Yovanovitch, meanwhile, made headlines as one of the key witnesses in Trump's first impeachment inquiry, which centered on his efforts to strong-arm the Ukrainian government into publicly announcing investigations into the Biden family ahead of the 2020 US election. More than a dozen witnesses, including Yovanovitch, testified about Trump's pressure campaign, which included withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and dangling a White House meeting for Ukraine's president while demanding the investigations. Yovanovitch's testimony focused on her work as ambassador to Ukraine and how corrupt forces — both in the US and Ukraine — led to her unceremonious ouster and abrupt recall back to the US before the end of her term. She also described how ""shocked and devastated"" she felt when she learned the details of a July 2019 call between Trump and Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which Trump pressured Zelenskyy to investigate the Bidens, called Yovanovitch ""bad news,"" and said that she was ""going to go through some things."" While she testified, Trump lobbed attacks against Yovanovitch on Twitter in a move legal experts said amounted to witness intimidation. Yovanovitch, when asked to respond to the attacks mid-testimony, said they were ""very intimidating."" Trump's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

3/20/2022,"This year in particular, it’s more important than ever to pay special attention to how you file your taxes; as a result of last year’s stimulus bill, you could be entitled to credits and rebates you don’t usually qualify for. These special credits are available to you even if you receive Social Security Supplemental Income and/or do not make enough money to file a tax return — or simply do not file one. Getting Money Back? How You Should Use Your 2022 Tax Refund, According To Experts
Also See: Here’s the Average IRS Tax Refund Amount by State Here are the big two credits to watch out for this tax filing season if you receive SSI or Social Security benefits. As part of the stimulus relief bill, the child tax credit was expanded to $3,600 per eligible child under the age of six and $3,000 per eligible child ages six to 17. Advance monthly portions comprising half of this credit began going out to families in July 2021 and were paid out through December 2021, with the other half of the credit available now, during tax filing time. If you did not claim this credit last year, fret not — you can simply claim it now, although it might be called a rebate credit depending on what you claimed last year. Your child tax credit payments will not affect your Social Security benefits, the Social Security Administration noted in a blog post. If you receive SSI, any child tax credit you receive, including advance payments received in 2021, won’t count as income or resources for 12 months after you receive it when considering income eligibility for SSI. This suggests the SSA wants to see that you needed the money and are not simply holding it in a bank account. See: Social Security Schedule — When the First COLA Checks Will Arrive in February 2022
Find: Social Security Refund — Here’s Why Some College Students Can Get Money Back The EITC provides low-to-moderate-income workers and families certain program-specific tax breaks. You can use the credit to reduce the taxes you owe to the IRS, which could in turn increase your overall tax refund. Like the CTC, the EITC is determined by your income and the number of qualifying dependents. You can still receive the EITC if you receive Social Security or SSI, as long as you meet the rules for the EITC program. Sometimes, if you have a child with a disability, you can claim the EITC. Social Security benefits and SSI do not affect one’s eligibility for the EITC. Your disability insurance or SSI payments might be counted as earned income for the EITC, but that will depend on a number of factors. To claim the EITC, the first step is to make sure you file a tax return for 2021. More From GOBankingRates Walmart Accepts EBT/SNAP Food Stamps As Payment -- What Are the Restrictions?
