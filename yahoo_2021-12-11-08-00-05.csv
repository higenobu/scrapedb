12/11/2021,"Digging into your family’s ancestry might be a fun hobby, but it might also inadvertently turn up some long-kept secrets.  That’s what happened to Emily Glankler, a high school history teacher who runs the podcast and TikTok account known as Anti-Social Studies. She shared her story with her followers. “The craziest ancestry story you will hear today (it involves world wars and FAKE DEATHS),” she wrote in the post. Taking a long flight home for the holidays? Here are some hacks to make your journey bearable She further explained the situation in an interview with In The Know. The story revolves around her great-grandfather, who she knew as Alfred.  “My dad doesn’t remember a lot about him. He died when he was pretty young. But he does remember that he was very quiet and spoke in a ‘strange accent’ that sounded vaguely Eastern European, which is weird because they always told us that his last name, my maiden name, was French or French Canadian,” she said. She explained that, 20 years ago, her dad (Alfred’s grandson) met another man with the same last name, which had never happened before. They began chatting, and the man described his own father in a way that reminded Glankler’s dad of his grandfather. The man then explained that it couldn’t have been the same person because his father had died many years ago in an oil rig explosion in Texas. Glanker’s dad grew up in Texas, so he thought it seemed pretty suspicious. Create sweet treats with the kids this holiday season with help from Walmart: Separately, Glankler said her grandmother was looking through old items when she found a photo of Alfred from World War I listing him under an entirely different name: David. Members of her family brought this information to Glankler. A major history buff, they suggested that she should figure it out. That’s when she first started working through the mystery on Ancestry.com. She dug through old censuses, military documents and other records. Eventually, she found that “Alfred” was actually “David” all along. He wasn’t French either — he was Jewish and Eastern European. She claimed she found that “David” got married in Maine then left to fight in World War I but never returned. Actually, he did return… to Texas, where he got married and took on the name “Alfred.” There, she claimed he faked his death and took on a new identity as the great-grandfather she thought she knew. “That’s two fake deaths and three families — we’re the third,” Glankler said. She told In The Know that she’s been doing this research for a while. She recently logged in to Ancestry.com again and found tons of information supplied by other users. She praised the collaborative nature of the site. “I found all of these, like, newspaper clippings about him passing bad checks around places right after World War I,” she said. “There was also a registration card for World War II. As my dad put it, he thought his military length of service was just a suggestion.” Ancestry.com reached out to her to help her do more research thanks to her viral post, which now has nearly 2 million views.  “Everyone’s very fascinated by my great-grandfather… the scoundrel,” she joked. Glankler’s research is still unfolding, and the best way to get updates on her story is to follow her on TikTok. Commenters are certainly invested in the drama. “I feel like I need a whole Netflix series on this,” one wrote. “Real life Don Draper,” another said. “Unbelievable,” a third commented. “That’s so messed up.”  In The Know is now available on Apple News — follow us here!

12/11/2021,"The leadership of the Oklahoma National Guard has acknowledged that its fight with the federal government over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate ultimately may lead to ""career ending federal action"" for troops.  Brig. Gen. Thomas Mancino, the top officer for Oklahoma's Guard, released a statement Thursday that opened with a forceful defense of service members under his charge exercising their ""personal responsibility"" and ""the right to not take the vaccine.""  However, the message quickly pivoted as Mancino began to note that his and Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt's authority is limited.

When under their governor's authority, the Guard is said to be operating under Title 32. However, when deployed by the federal government, they operate under so-called Title 10 orders and are commanded by the president.  ""The Governor has used his authority under Title 32 to grant you a limited safe harbor within his authority to not be subject to Title 10 negative actions for not taking the vaccine,"" Mancino explained.   This distinction -- whom an individual Guard member ultimately takes orders from and when -- has been the crux of the fight between Oklahoma and the Pentagon. That fight now includes a lawsuit launched by Stitt and threats from the Pentagon to withhold pay.  In one of the last paragraphs of his message, Mancino noted that he is ""fully vaccinated, plus the booster.""  ""I believe the vaccine to be safe and effective against COVID-19 based on the millions of doses administered,"" he wrote.  In his message, Mancino admitted that, ultimately, ""continued service in the national guard will require connections with Title 10 authority.""  ""Such connections including training events, schools, and mobilizations are going to eventually force you out of that safe harbor, and subject you to title 10 authorities. This is reality,"" his statement said. Increasing politicization of the National Guard means that Oklahoma Guardsmen aren't the only troops stuck between state and federal posturing. A spokesperson for Stitt told Military.com last week that at least five other Republican governors are considering similar moves.  While Stitt and other governors may be eager to test the limits of their authority against the Pentagon and the rest of the federal government, Mancino's message makes it clear the struggle could have consequences for Guard members.  ""It is important you do not mistake my vigorous defense of the Governor's rights under Title 32 as a guarantee you will not face consequences from Title 10 authority,"" Mancino wrote. ""I have no such power.""  -- Konstantin Toropin can be reached at konstantin.toropin@military.com.
