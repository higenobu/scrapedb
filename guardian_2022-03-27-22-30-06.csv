3/27/2022,"The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has called for the immediate suspension of charging for NHS maternity care for migrant women because members say this government policy is harming the health of pregnant women and their babies. The RCOG has urged the government to change its policies towards charging some migrant women for maternity care and to carry out an urgent review of how maternity care is provided to the group. It is the first time the health professionals’ body has issued a position statement on this issue. The charity Maternity Action and the Royal College of Midwives have long expressed concern about the impact of NHS charging on this group of women. Charging forms a key plank of the Home Office’s hostile environment for migrants. The government says the charging policy is in place to deter health tourism but medics treating migrant pregnant women say there is little evidence that previously free NHS maternity care for all attracted health tourists. Under current NHS rules, some groups of migrant women including those who are undocumented or who have been refused asylum are expected to pay for NHS maternity care. Bills typically start at about £7,000 and can rise to tens of thousands of pounds if complex care is required. NHS trusts can report debts of £500 or more to the Home Office, which can threaten a woman’s present or future immigration application. According to the 2019 MBRRACE-UK confidential inquiry into maternal deaths, three women were found to have died between 2015 and 2017 who may have been reluctant to access maternity care due to fears about charging and impact on their immigration status. Dr Brenda Kelly, an NHS consultant obstetrician working in Oxford, treats many pregnant migrant women. She is calling for the barriers to them accessing maternity care to be removed urgently. She described the case of one migrant woman who arrived in A&E shortly before delivering a stillborn baby. The woman had been fearful of coming forward for antenatal care although she was suffering from multiple, pregnancy-related health problems. “I hope I never have to hear cries like that woman’s cries ever again,” said Kelly. “The way to safeguard these women is to build up trust. If they are landed with a bill of several thousand pounds they will disengage. They are not health tourists, they are desperate. The commitment to maternal health equity means ending charges for maternity care. The time for action is now.” Along with immediate and permanent suspending of charging some migrant women for NHS maternity care, the RCOG is calling for a review by NHS trusts to improve practice when dealing with this group of women. It wants the introduction of minimum standards for interpreting services for women who do not speak English and an urgent review by government of how they care for pregnant, migrant women – including those who do not have to pay for maternity care, such as asylum seekers, but who are often moved around the country at short notice by the Home Office severing ties with the maternity team looking after them. The Department of Health and Social Care said: “All refugees, asylum seekers and victims of modern slavery are exempt from NHS treatment costs. While some other migrants or visitors to the UK may be required to contribute – in which cases they’ll be told if costs apply to them – we’ve always been clear urgent care should never be delayed or withheld over charges, including all maternity services. Trusts can also write off owed payments if someone is genuinely unable to afford it.”",News/Society,"Stop charging migrant women for NHS maternity care, RCOG urges",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/27/stop-charging-migrant-women-for-nhs-maternity-care-rcog-urges
3/27/2022,"The simmering row between London’s political leaders and central government over transport funding is escalating on a fresh battleground: possible legal action over suburban station car parks. London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has urged the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, to rescind his decision to block a planned affordable housing development on a tube station car park. Khan has instructed TfL to “explore all options” including seeking a judicial review after Shapps stepped in to veto the building at Cockfosters, north London, using a clause in the 1999 GLA Act. The development was approved by Enfield council last month and would have brought 351 new homes as well as open spaces. In a letter to Shapps seen by the Guardian, Khan said he was “deeply concerned” at the move. He said: “At a time when London is facing a serious housing crisis, I cannot understand why you would prioritise keeping a car park over building desperately needed new homes.” Khan said he was “very surprised … given the very positive conversations I have had with the secretary of state for the Department for Levelling Up, Homes and Communities [Michael Gove] about the government’s ambition to build the new homes families in this country need.” The development would have retained 47 parking spaces at the Piccadilly line station, out of the current 336. About 2,000 local residents opposed the scheme, with support from Theresa Villiers, the MP for the nearby marginal Chipping Barnet constituency, where similar plans to redevelop car parks at High Barnet for housing are proposed by TfL. Villiers, a former transport minister, has argued that the car parks “perform an important park-and-ride function, helping people get on to the public transport network”. After Shapps issued his veto earlier this month, she said: “We have saved Cockfosters from tower blocks.” The row comes as TfL is pushing for a long-term funding settlement from the Department for Transport as it recovers from the loss of billions in fare income during the Covid-19 pandemic. It is dependent on emergency financial help. It was given £200m last month by Shapps to last until June, which was granted with conditions that Khan raise revenues. Khan said in his letter, which was also sent to Gove, that prioritising “car parking spaces over hundreds of much-needed homes sends a worrying and frankly contradictory message from government. The scheme would also have generated much-needed revenue for TfL to reinvest in public transport, so this decision also undermines the agreements we are negotiating regarding TfL housing delivery.” The mayor said he had “asked TfL to explore all available options to ensure that this development can go ahead”. Responding to questions in the Commons this month, Shapps wrongly claimed the plan would have “removed all but 12 car parking spaces”, adding: “While I am keen to get people using active travel and all forms of travel, the idea that only 12 cars a day would turn up was ludicrous.” He added: “It would just have meant other cars parking on the streets and inconveniencing residents. I encourage the mayor of London to come forward with better plans than that.” A Department for Transport spokesperson said: “When redeveloping land used by transport hubs, the transport secretary must approve of all plans but in this case the application did not provide adequate parking for passengers. Transport for London can submit alternative plans should they wish to do so.” Gove’s department has been asked to call in the planning process for a ministerial decision. It declined to comment.",News/UK news,London mayor threatens legal action over minister’s veto on housing plan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/27/london-mayor-threatens-legal-action-over-ministers-veto-on-housing-plan
3/27/2022,"At the bustling tea stands and roadside eateries of Delhi, European politics is not a regular topic of conversation. But with wall-to-wall coverage of the war in Ukraine on television and in the newspapers, petrol prices rising and pressure growing on the prime minister, Narendra Modi, to denounce Russia, Indians are starting to grapple with the consequences of the conflict 2,800 miles away. Ram Agarwal, a shopkeeper, does not condone the loss of civilian life but nor can he bring himself to criticise Russia. He grew up in the 1950s and 60s when India and the Soviet Union were such close allies that Nikita Khrushchev coined the slogan “Hindi Rusi bhai bhai” (Indians and Russians are brothers). “I am 74 and my generation grew up with Hindi Rusi bhai bhai. It’s like attacking a dear old friend,” he said. Arvind Maurya, an electrician, also expressed the even-handedness that has marked much of the public response. “I hear that Ukraine used to be a part of Russia, but instead of respecting that, Nato is pulling Ukraine into its own orbit. But war is never good for anyone and the Russian bombing of civilians is not the way to solve these differences. They must sit down and talk,” he said. But away from the street, feelings are stronger. Indians from the right and left have converged on the war, the former because of their antipathy towards western culture and the latter because of their anti-Americanism, particularly in relation to foreign policy. For these two groups, the war has exposed what they see as the west’s double standards and hypocrisy. Its interventions in other countries and campaigns of regime change are acceptable, but not Russia’s. In a column, Abhijit Iyer-Mitra, a senior fellow at the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, contrasted western support for sanctions against Iraq before 2003, which he said had killed “hundreds of thousands of children”, with the indignation over Ukraine. “Compare the outrage over bombs falling on Ukraine, which have resulted in around 200 civilian deaths (as of February 22) – not even a fraction of the deaths caused by the US invasions, occupations and attacks on Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Libya,” he wrote. There is considerable support for the claim that Ukraine and Nato provoked Russia to the point where it had no choice but to invade. These views, expressed by analysts, politicians and retired military officers, have featured prominently in television debates. Vinod Bhatia, a former air marshal, said Nato had promised Soviet leaders and later Putin that it would not keep expanding eastwards, but had reneged on its promise, a claim that has been pushed by the Kremlin. Nato denies it ever made such an agreement. “The west is equally responsible, with Putin, for this totally avoidable and unnecessary war,” Bhatia said. The claims of hypocrisy also extend to how European countries continue to buy Russian oil and gas while expecting India to impose sanctions on Russia. “Why should India pay for US folly in drawing Ukraine into Nato? US sanctions are hurting us and we should support them?” the former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal asked in the Times of India. Given the mood, Modi is under little public pressure at home to get off the fence, though some editorials have called India’s position “tragic” and “untenable”. India has abstained from condemning Russia at the UN while trying to keep the west happy with talk of peace. It is a balancing act with which Joe Biden may be losing patience. Last week, Biden described India’s stance as “shaky”. American prodding of India to toe the western line and denounce Russia can evoke an irascible response. Brahma Chellaney, a strategic affairs analyst, asked why India should line up with the west when no one, least of all America, speaks up for India over Chinese aggression on the border with India, where a standoff has lasted almost two years. “At a time when India confronts China’s border aggression, including its threat of a full-scale war, Biden won’t open his mouth on that but he calls India’s response ‘shaky’ to a distant war he helped to provoke,” Chellaney tweeted. The war rhetoric has alarmed some commentators who have flinched at the portrayal of Putin and Russia as evil. For one, the epithet does not resonate among Indians, where China that is seen as the biggest threat. Parsa Venkateshwar Rao Jr, a columnist, has been dismayed at how “the United States is turning Putin into a Saddam Hussein and how, when Biden calls Putin a ‘war criminal’, it leaves no space for negotiation. It is deeply alarming, the American rhetoric, because unlike Saddam, who had no weapons of mass destruction, Putin does. The whole pitch borders on hysterical.” Up to a point, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, one of India’s foremost commentators, agrees with these criticisms. Europe, he says, is caught between its desire to send a strong message to Russia and sanctimonious moralising. Its credibility is impugned because it is simply not willing to pay even the minimal economic price for a strong stand. Yet for Indians to expose western hypocrisy is not enough for Mehta because it fails to answer the wider question of what kind of world order Indians want to build. Writing in the Indian Express, he said: “An America losing capital outside the west because of its hypocrisy, a Europe still speaking in forked tongues, a Russia that would rather see the world and its own citizens suffer, and India and China using western hypocrisy as a cover for displaying an outright cynicism, is not a good portent for a world order.”",News/World news,Indians reluctant to denounce Russian ‘brothers’ over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/indians-reluctant-to-denounce-russian-brothers-over-ukraine

3/27/2022,"Many of the pupils who arrive in Gemma Patel’s classroom at Birmingham’s City academy don’t speak. “When students first come to us, they often don’t talk, they don’t communicate,” she said during a break from teaching a lesson on verbs. “It’s not because they can’t, but because they haven’t necessarily felt able to before.” She is the assistant head of Core Hello, a pioneering programme set up by the Core Education Trust in September 2021 for newly arrived refugee and migrant children who need extra support settling in to school life in the UK. Over 12 weeks, pupils are taught basic survival language skills, taken on trips into the city centre to help with cultural acclimatisation, and are given support for any trauma they may have experienced, before returning to mainstream school. The trust has taken on a number of pupils who came to the UK after the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan last year, and said it was open to hosting Ukrainian refugees. “It’s not just language that’s the barrier, it’s dealing with everything that they’ve gone through. Just moving and resettling is very traumatic for young people, let alone maybe coming from a country which is unsettled or has experienced war,” said Rekha Shell-Macleod, the head of school at City academy. “But we’ve found with Core Hello, in a short period of time they make the progress that in a normal school setting may take a year or two.” With three members of staff to 20 pupils, it was a “huge investment as a trust”, she said, but it had made it much easier to spot signs of trauma and ensure pupils were able to integrate into normal school life when they were ready. “When they first arrive, we do an activity where we ask them about themselves, and we’ll ask them who their friends are. Often they won’t be able to name anybody,” said Patel. “And then we say, but you’ve got 19 friends here in this room. And it’s really nice for them to realise that.” Previous research has shown refugee and asylum-seeking children face long delays accessing education after arriving in the UK, while their learning is affected by trauma and mental health difficulties, bullying and a lack of awareness and expertise among some school staff. With the number of migrants and refugees arriving in Birmingham increasing, Core Hello hopes to provide an example of how schools can better help these pupils. During a Wednesday morning English lesson, students use timelines they have drawn to explain their journey to the UK. Most have drawn flags from around the world, perhaps their home country’s highest mountain or national sport, in some cases war and invasion, and all culminate with a picture of a home Britain. “In school in Afghanistan, I had friends and was captain of the cricket team,” said Salman, a year 9 pupil who started attending the City academy with his younger brother Noaman after their family fled the Taliban last summer. “We had to come to the UK on a flight and stayed in a hotel in London where it was very busy and crowded. I started school here and now we can finally live safely.” In a piece of school work, Salman wrote about how “Birmingham is a lot safer than Afghanistan because here is traffic lights to cross the road”, something he was not used to. At the Jewellery Quarter academy, one of the Core trust’s schools, Sayed, a year 10 pupil, said he had travelled across Europe alone and spent months in a Calais refugee camp after his parents sent him away from Afghanistan for safety. “I didn’t want to leave my parents, but I had to,” he said, speaking in Pashtun translated by a fellow pupil. “I had to travel alone and I was scared. [In Calais] the police kept hurting us and pushing us back. There was no food, so we had to eat apples and drink rainwater.” He now lives with his uncle in Birmingham and is slowly settling in to school life, where his favourite subject is maths. He says he enjoys going to the park and playing cricket after school. Jamie Barton, the headteacher of the Jewellery Quarter academy, said: “It’s our duty to support children who have fled persecution. Take Sayed – someone who travelled unaccompanied to flee the Taliban for thousands of miles – if we can’t give him a home as a school, then who will?”",News/Education,‘You’ve got friends’: Birmingham school scheme aims to ease refugee trauma,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/27/youve-got-friends-birmingham-school-scheme-aims-to-ease-refugee-trauma
3/27/2022,"Why do restaurants give us bread at the start of the meal? I can never resist eating it, but it means I fill up and don’t appreciate the meal fully. It seems counterproductive for both restaurateur and diner. Colin Woodcock, Beaconsfield Send new questions to nq@theguardian.com. Because more food is eaten. Bread causes a glucose and insulin spike, which results in you eating more and subsequently a blood-sugar crash 90 minutes later, so you are also more likely to order dessert. Vaz Frigerio To keep us buying more drinks while they delay taking our orders. Paul Reid It’s cheaper to serve bread than to increase portion sizes, I guess. London25 It’s to go with the circuses. BaddHamster I love bread, especially artisan sourdough, with hard crusts and totally aerated pockets of wheat. However, I have discovered that I have a gluten intolerance. I now believe that restaurateurs place the bread before meals just to watch me salivate with envy and desire as my companions chomp on that delicious filler. Joe Grennell The bread is put there to accompany the meal. Either with the starter and/or the main meal. It’s not meant to be eaten as a pre-starter. Susan Holland Here in Italy, they always bring bread before the meal, but no one eats it before the meal – they eat it with the meal, especially anything with a sauce, obviously. Having said all that, they do also have breadsticks sometimes, and of course it’s impossible not to eat those as soon as they’re in front of you. PortEllen57 I was told that it was to discourage people from changing their mind and leaving; once you’d got stuck into the bread, you were committed. I’ve no idea how true this is. Is there a single reason? pol098 As a culinarian and chef working in the business for more than 40 years, I would say that, in some cases, an establishment has a good baker and a great recipe and just want to showcase. In other cases, it might be to reduce consumption in an “all you can eat” situation. In other cases, it is simply a delightful pairing to get the taste buds flowing and might induce further requests for other options or courses. But I will say: if the bread is not good at the start of any meal, it can easily spoil the entire meal. Ken Grant A hungry customer is an impatient, angry beast. What better way to ensure that your customers don’t go crazy about slow service or long ticket times than by taking the edge off of the hunger with some bread? Paul McNally In France, bread is also placed on the table before the main dishes are served. This is because the bread is to be eaten with the meal. You can always spot the Britons because they immediately butter the bread and start chomping on it as if it’s a starter. All other Europeans wait. Margaret Boudra I was a waiter for 30 years. In my experience, when customers come in hungry, they are cranky and bitchy. Low blood sugar does that to you. An alcoholic beverage does nothing to improve their mood, but some food starts to get them back to their lovely, friendly selves. It’s a metamorphosis from crank to charming. dancog The questioner has already supplied the answer: bread is not an appetiser and, yes, it does fill you up and reduce appetite for the main meal. This works to the restaurant‘s advantage. Assuming that bread is a cheap item for the restaurant to produce (compare the raw material costs of, say, 100g of cooked bread, which is 50% water, with the cost of things such as fish, asparagus, meat, eggs, etc) then it is in the restaurant’s interest to see you take 100g of substance off the main course in the form of cheap bread. It can reduce portion sizes and make more profit on the mains, but overall you will still feel sated. And (last twist of the knife) don’t forget that you usually pay for the bread as well. Jeffrey Cosser I have worked in many restaurants in my life and in some (not all) we served bread at the start of the meal. The only reason I can give is that many guests are a bit cranky when they are hungry. When the restaurant is busy, food sometimes takes longer. If they have something to nibble on, they are more relaxed. And happier. Nicolas Cazcarro I always thought it was a courtesy thing going back to biblical times. You offered your guests bread and something to drink as they entered your home. Catherine McCall It’s because bread defrosts quicker than the meal. Philip Barnett If people arrive hungry and their first course takes time to cook and prepare, they will remember the wait and leave a negative review and/or a small tip. If they have drinks and some good bread with a tasty butter, they are less likely to notice how long they wait. Antoinette Moses They serve bread at the start for a few reasons. First, it’s a cheap gesture that symbolises hospitality. Second, as soon as you’ve had something in your stomach, you’re more likely to throw some wine in on top of it. Third, the margins on wine are far, far more than bread (or most other food), so it’s an inducement to buy more high-margin products. Mike Wilson Your customers do not want to sit with an empty table in front of them, while your kitchen might be under pressure, so the stuff they order might take a bit of time. So, put something on the table: bread or grissini, a bowl of olives, the wine order or just some fizzy water. Quick and easy and they won’t get frustrated waiting. It enables them to give the partly sated diner smaller starters and main courses and thus save on their more expensive ingredients. Those who enjoy puddings will usually order them even if they feel full. Thomas Boyd I live in France, where every meal – including a sandwich – is accompanied by a basket of bread. This bread is always gooood. But I don’t think it’s the done thing to eat it before the actual food arrives. And there’s never any butter, unless what you’ve ordered is oysters. I sometimes eat out here just for the bread. May it never stop! stimpyyouidiot As a matter of interest, talking about France: the law of 8 June 1967 mentions it is mandatory for restaurant to offer bread. gregoire I do understand the point that it may blunt your appetite, but recently I went to Tom Kitchin’s place in Edinburgh and we got the most lovely basket of bread – warm with a little side dish of soft salted butter, not the freezing hard pellets that you used to get. We fell in love with the place immediately. I think it’s a pretty inexpensive way of giving you a wee warm welcoming hug, which settles you in and makes you trust that they know what they’re doing. ciaran1968 Most restaurants in the UK don’t do this now, in my experience. Bread is now one of the starters listed. Even in places where it appears to be complimentary, you are generally charged for it. CroneRanger I was once told by a serious French wine drinker: “Never drink wine when you are thirsty.” It’s perhaps the same with really good food?

3/27/2022,"Tom* started working for Amazon as a delivery van driver in Norfolk nearly three years ago. Since then, his rates of pay have been revised numerous times, including at least four changes since September. He and his partner are probably going to have to abandon hopes of buying a home together, as the money Amazon had promised was not sustained. “All of us are constantly terrified of never having enough money to survive,” he said. “It really is the most toxic industry.” Amazon is the largest private parcel courier in the UK, delivering 15% of the estimated 5.4bn packages in 2021 – the equivalent of more than 2m items a day. They range from Prime next-day deliveries to the last mile of packages shipped from thousands of miles away in China or India. Volumes rose dramatically during the pandemic, and again as the British economy reopened and competition for labour to meet demand during the rush last Christmas led Amazon and other employers to increase rates of pay. To deliver a service of this scale and complexity, Amazon relies on a network of thousands of drivers. Rather than keeping these workers on its books, it manages them through what are called delivery service providers, small companies that handle groups of drivers, who work as self-employed independent contractors with no right to holiday pay, sick pay or the “national living wage”. Now the winter rush is over, Amazon drivers are raising the alarm, reporting significant drops in pay and in the number of shifts being offered, while others say petrol payments have not increased to reflect soaring fuel prices. Hourly rates are on average just over £14.60 per hour – about £2 an hour less, or 12% below, rates in October and November during the Black Friday and pre-Christmas rush. Some drivers say pay was cut back in December and others in January or February, despite a nationwide shortages of skilled workers. Drivers say they have been handed a pay cut equivalent to an average £20 a day from the temporary “peak” rates introduced in October despite, some say, being asked to deliver up to 60 more parcels per shift. Pavlina Draganova of campaign group Organise said that while pay was returning to the same levels as before the Christmas peak season, for many it still represented a real-terms cut. “We’re in quite a different world now than we were last summer, and even if the salary now is the same [per hour] as it was then, this is a real-terms pay cut in the face of soaring inflation and rising petrol prices, that is only likely to become more untenable in the coming months,” she said. More than 39,000 people have signed a petition via Organise – more than 250 of whom are Amazon workers – calling on the online retailer to review pay rates. “As delivery drivers we are exhausted, we’ve worked tirelessly through a pandemic only to come out of the other side and receive a kick in the teeth,” the petition says. Drivers say rates of pay are constantly fluctuating – with one driver experiencing five different changes in day rates since September while others had had two or three adjustments in that time. The uncertainty makes it hard to budget. Several drivers who said while they had not seen a drop in daily pay compared with pre-“peak” levels, they were getting one or two fewer shifts each week. Some said shifts were being dropped or offered at very short notice, making it difficult to plan ahead. Rates of pay can differ radically around the country, as small groups of drivers are managed by small companies known as “delivery service partners”, rather than directly by Amazon. Drivers receive just over £14 per hour on paper, but many say they work longer than the hours they are paid. They say “a nine hour delivery round” does not include time waiting to load vans or dealing with undelivered parcels at the end of the day. While some drivers said their driving time was only eight hours, more said they were likely to spend 10 hours on the road including re-deliveries and hold-ups such as traffic jams and parking. Drivers also have to pay costs such as insurance, van rental and maintenance, as well as parking tickets, which are often an unavoidable part of completing a job. They get extra for fuel but say the per-mile rate doesn’t always cover actual costs, particularly since the increase in fuel prices. Several drivers said they received 21p per mile in fuel payments but would need at least 25p per mile to cover their actual costs as petrol prices have soared during the war in Ukraine. “As a single person I don’t think I could survive on this money,” said Tom in Norfolk. “They want you to be available seven days a week at the drop of a hat for them but they give you no guarantees.” Sam*, another driver near Birmingham, said: “In 2020, when we were in serious [pandemic] lockdown, I got £160 a day and after that it has got less and less. It is hard work and they follow [your progress on the route] on the computer so you can’t have even one minute break.” The driver said their pay rate had dropped to £120 for at least 10 hours a day and they were getting one day a week fewer shifts. “We don’t know what is going on with Amazon and if you ask a question you never get an answer,” the driver said. Kate Robinson is a lawyer at Leigh Day who is leading legal action by Amazon drivers who say they should be entitled to basic employment rights such as the national living wage and holiday pay. These are denied as Amazon says they are self-employed independent contractors. The drivers she represents have reported the same issues, with constantly changing rates of pay and rounds that take longer than they are supposed to. “The rates are usually calculated on the basis of nine-hour [rounds] but in our experience most drivers will take several hours more than that with loading and redelivering items,” said Robinson. “With expenses and the hours worked some drivers are coming in quite significantly below the national minimum wage. Because they are not classed as employees or workers they don’t have any right to be paid that.” Amazon said the latest pay changes were not a pay cut but a return to usual rates after the peak Christmas period. It said it had taken action to support delivery service providers over increased fuel costs. “Delivery service providers offer drivers incentives at different times and locations throughout the year to meet operational needs and this is clearly communicated to them at the time. To suggest the end of these incentives are cuts to drivers’ earnings is wrong,” Amazon said in a statement. “We are committed to ensuring that the people contracted by our independent delivery providers are fairly compensated and are treated with respect, and this is reflected by the positive feedback we receive from drivers every day,” the company said, adding that it used “sophisticated technology to plan delivery routes to ensure that drivers aren’t receiving and driving with too many packages”. * The drivers’ names have been changed ",News/Technology,Amazon delivery drivers in UK raise alarm over real-terms pay cut,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/27/amazon-delivery-drivers-raise-alarm-over-real-terms-pay-cut
3/27/2022,"Civil war brings devastation to one close-knit family in Deirdre Kinahan’s latest history play for Fishamble theatre company. In a production that presents conflicting viewpoints in kaleidoscopic form, we see how the bonds between two sisters, and between husband and wife, are pulled apart under extreme duress. Commissioned as part of Ireland’s Decade of Centenaries programme, it focuses on the period from the end of the war of independence in 1921 and the truce that followed, to the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty that precipitated the bitter Irish civil war. While the opening scenes are necessarily heavy on exposition, director Jim Culleton and the tremendous cast succeed in balancing the factual background with vivid, gripping drama. Based on Kinahan’s research into military archives, the central characters of two Dublin women, Nell (Mary Murray) and her sister Alice (Caitríona Ennis) were inspired by an amalgam of several women’s testimonies, from the pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty sides. In interwoven dialogue, Nell, Alice and Alice’s husband, PJ, (Naoise Dunbar) tell their story of idealism, passion and disillusionment, shifting between past and present, narration and enactment. Staged across a warehouse in Dublin’s docks, designer Maree Kearns’ set, Kevin Smith’s lighting and Carl Kennedy’s sound composition create a fluid performance space that evokes a barricade, burning buildings, or a makeshift office where Alice dispatches bulletins on the latest atrocities. Drawing on recent work by historians and sociologists documenting the sexual violence and abuse experienced by women during these revolutionary years, this unflinching production helps to bring previously hidden histories to the surface, inviting us to trace horrific legacies of the civil war in the decades that followed.

3/27/2022,"A rise in anti-Islam rhetoric in the French presidential election campaign risks creating a “spiral of hatred”, scapegoating law-abiding Muslims in a similar way to the discourse against Jews in the 1930s, the rector of the Paris mosque has said. “I’m extremely worried,” said Chems-eddine Hafiz, the rector of Paris’s historic Grande Mosquée. “We’re in a society that is fractured and searching for itself, a society that is weakened and fearful after the pandemic. The fact of looking for a scapegoat – there have been precedents to that: in 1930 when the finger began to be pointed at Jews who became ‘the problem of a whole society’ … Today it’s no longer Jews, it’s Muslims … I thought in the 21st century we’d be safe from that type of discourse.” Hafiz published a book this month, With All Due Respect, We’re Children of the Republic, to counter what he called heightened anti-Muslim rhetoric sweeping across the French right during the election campaign. With the centrist Emmanuel Macron leading the polls and favourite to win re-election next month, some rival candidates have focused on Islam and immigration. The far-right outsider candidate Eric Zemmour, a former TV pundit who has convictions for inciting racial hatred, refers regularly to the discredited conspiracy theory of the “great replacement”, in which he claims local French populations could be replaced by newcomers, making France a majority Muslim country on the verge of civil war. In a TV interview after declaring his candidacy, Zemmour called on Muslims in France to renounce the practice of their religion. In a TV debate last month, he told a voter he was standing to “save France from Islam” and from French people’s “replacement”. The far-right Marine Le Pen, who intends to hold a referendum on immigration and ban the Muslim headscarf from all public places, is shown by polls as the most likely candidate to face Macron in the final vote on 24 April. Valérie Pécresse, who is running for Nicolas Sarkozy’s traditional right party, Les Républicains, has been criticised for referring to the great replacement theory at a Paris rally. She has vowed to limit the wearing of the Muslim headscarf in some public spaces, including by athletes in sporting events. All candidates on the right have referenced a mood of fear in France after the Islamist terrorist attacks in Paris 2015 and the horror of the decapitation of a French secondary schoolteacher, Samuel Paty, in 2020. Hafiz said he was the first to condemn Islamist terrorism and his mosque was at the heart of work to combat radicalisation in France. But he feared that the majority of law-abiding Muslim French citizens were being conflated with terrorist attacks, despite often being the victims of terrorism themselves. “For several years now, at every election in France, certain candidates have spoken of the ‘problem’ of Islam, linking Islam to immigration or to terrorism,” he told the Guardian. “French Muslims have faced stigmatisation or insults or the view that Islam is incompatible with the rules of the French Republic, or with the west. But in this election, it’s much more serious because there is a candidate who completely lets loose and talks of the ‘great replacement’ and who affirms with vehemence that Islam and Muslims can’t stay in France, that their place is elsewhere, and if they want to stay in this country they must no longer practise their religion.” Hafiz said other candidates on the right appeared to compete with Zemmour on Islam, such as during Les Républicains’ internal primary race to choose a candidate. He said that despite the main concerns of French voters being issues such as making ends meet, it had become “almost fashionable” for candidates “to criticise Islam and Muslims, to see them as non-desirables who are dangerous or who bring insecurity.” He said: “We’re in 2022, we’re in the fourth, even fifth, generation of Muslims in France and they are still considered foreigners.” There are estimated to be between 800,000 and 1 million people who attend mosques or Muslim prayer rooms in France. Hafiz said he feared there could be an increase in anti-Muslim acts after the election. He said other elements of Zemmour’s discourse were worrying, including his claim that the Nazi collaborator Marshal Philippe Pétain saved French Jews rather than aiding their deportation to death camps. Zemmour, the Paris-born son of Jewish Berbers who emigrated from Algeria in the 1950s, last week responded to Hafiz’s call for Muslims to turn out to vote in the April elections in order to counter hatred. Zemmour tweeted: “The rector of Paris’s Grande Mosquée has appealed to vote against me. Do you intend to obey him?” Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist party candidate, who is languishing in the polls, visited the Paris mosque recently where she warned against presidential candidates “scapegoating” Muslims. She said she was extremely worried about “hateful” political discourse that damaged “fraternity” in France.",News/World news,"Anti-Islam rhetoric in French election risks ‘spiral of hatred’, says Paris mosque rector",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/27/anti-islam-rhetoric-in-french-election-risks-spiral-of-hatred-says-paris-mosque-rector
