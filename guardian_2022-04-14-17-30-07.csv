4/14/2022,"The head of Australia’s peak medical body will meet with the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to urge him to reconsider his “small target” strategy on health. Dr Omar Khorshid will warn that substantial funding is urgently needed to address the crisis in the country’s hospitals. The message from the Australian Medical Association president comes after Albanese called him on Thursday morning in response to the association criticising Labor’s $135m urgent care clinic policy, announced this week, as “incoherent”. Albanese was in the marginal seat of Hunter on Thursday, announcing that one of the 50 clinics would be built in Cessnock to take pressure off the local hospital’s emergency department. Khorshid told Guardian Australia he expected to meet with Albanese and the party’s shadow health minister, Mark Butler, in the coming days about the party’s health platform. He said the association had not been so far consulted on any of Labor’s proposed health policies. He said while the urgent care clinics might be popular with the public, they would not make any difference to the pressure on emergency departments. He added that he would be encouraging Labor to be more “courageous” on the issue of health. In the lead-up to the election, both major parties have told the association they will not commit to the 5% boost to public hospital funding being demanded by states as they deal with a “logjam” of patients – leading to ambulance ramping, and patients unable to be admitted for treatment. This 5% funding boost, which would lift the commonwealth’s share of public hospital funding to 50%, would cost about $5bn a year. “50-50 hospital funding has not been accepted by either party as part of their platforms, and we’ve pushed it hard with both and we’ve had ‘noes’ from both so far,” Khorshid told Guardian Australia. “We’re not giving up just yet – which is why we’re doing all this work, because we think it’s a no-brainer, basically. And the states agree with us, so we’ll keep pushing … But at this stage, we’re not expecting it to be part of either party’s announcements.” Khorshid added that Labor had still not told the AMA what the party would be doing. “But I’m pretty sure it won’t include 50-50, unless we are amazingly successful in the next few days,” he said. “Neither party is interested.” Khorshid said he would be asking Albanese – who has been pursuing a small target strategy, eschewing the multibillion policies Labor took to the last election – to “stand for health”. “We have not seen their vision for healthcare; we have seen a few small, piecemeal announcements,” he said. “We’re hoping that that will be a broad vision tackling the real problems, rather than a clinic here, a small thing there: marginal, seat-focused campaigns which might win elections, but won’t fix the health system. “If [Albanese] can actually show that he stands for health, rather than spin and manipulating numbers and all this other stuff that the pollies normally do, [he needs to) actually stand up and say, ‘We will pay for it and we will find a way to pay for it.’” Khorshid said that without the urgent injection of federal funds, which the AMA has said should be directed to increasing state hospital capacity, the crisis gripping Australia’s hospitals will worsen. He warned this would be exacerbated by a surge in unmet demand for surgery which had been postponed as a result of the pandemic, as well as an ageing demographic. “We’ll see a situation where you basically can’t access low-urgency elective surgery in public hospitals. You’ll just have to go private if you want a cataract or a hip replacement,” Khorshid said.

We are going to see that more and more. “I think it actually won’t be allowed to deteriorate much more than it is at the moment because it’ll just be untenable. How can you justify watching people die in emergency departments when you could do something about it? It’s at your fingers, the solution. “I think it’ll just get so bad that eventually the crisis will create a response. But let’s get in there now, because we’ve got plenty of indicators and almost no disagreement.” The call comes as ambulance ramping becomes an increasing problem for state governments, with the new South Australian Labor premier, Peter Malinauskas, winning the recent election largely on his commitment to fix the ramping crisis in the state. The Queensland government has also called for the federal government to commit to the 50-50 funding pledge. It is also under pressure about the growing issue of hospital ramping, with reports this week of 000 calls going unanswered.",News/Australia news,Health sector disappointed by major party funding inaction amid hospital crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/14/health-sector-disappointed-by-major-party-funding-inaction-amid-hospital-crisis
4/14/2022,"Few authors today write about fear as vividly as Kosovan-born Pajtim Statovci. For Arsim, the Albanian protagonist in Statovci’s latest novel Bolla (translated by David Hackston), fear is not a passing impulse in his nervous system but its very substance. There are two types of people, Arsim suggests: “People who don’t need to fear anything and people who ought to fear everything.” He is one of the latter. “That’s how fear works,” he adds, “it arrives all at once, and it is indivisible.” Arsim’s fear could be attributed to environmental factors. It is 1995, and war is on the verge of breaking out in Pristina, Kosovo, where he lives with his devoted wife Ajshe, whom he doesn’t love. To make matters worse, he is a father-to-be, a future that fills him with dread. He embarks on a love affair with Miloš, which is doubly illicit, not only because he’s a man, but also because he’s a Serb. “We always exit the apartment at different times: once we’ve made sure, one ear against the door, that there’s nobody in the corridor.” Forced by society behind closed doors, their love finds space to breathe in Statovci’s sensitive prose. He writes beautifully about the ecstasy of early passion through surreal, painterly detail. Miloš’s irises “look like a sky preparing for a storm”; his torso is “long, like a horse’s”. In these images, the picture of Miloš may remain amorphous and vague, but we feel the load of Arsim’s longing – we see Arsim seeing. When war inevitably comes to Pristina, their union is cut short, sending Arsim to an unnamed country abroad and Miloš to the front line. Cultural alienation, enforced separation, the persistence of trauma; these are the abiding themes of Statovic’s writing. Bolla’s narrative alternates between Arsim’s account and more intimate, impressionistic chapters from Miloš. This technique, which recalls Statovci’s award-winning earlier novels My Cat Yugoslavia and Crossing, creates a psychological proximity that stands in opposition to their physical and temporal distance. There is a subtle gesture to ideas of return and reunion in the book’s title, too. In Albanian mythology, a bolla is a snake-like figure that, each year, opens its eyes and devours anyone in its sight. Arsim writes a short story based on this myth, in which a blind girl befriends a bolla; they agree to meet every year, in the bloom of spring, in the same forest, on the same path. He shares the story with Miloš, the bolla becoming a symbol of hope for the two men that their relationship will follow the same arc. This, however, feels more like wishful thinking. After all, bolla can also mean “alien”, as Statovci tells us in his epigraph. Bolla’s strongest moments come when describing the totalising effects of fear related to Arsim’s situation as a refugee in exile. “One raised with fear never learns to live without it,” says Arsim. “It is the neighbour with a better parking space because this is his country, not yours; it is a dog walker nodding in your direction as you pass each other and squinting, not to say hello but because you are a foreigner.” Statovci, whose family fled to Finland from Kosovo when he was two, describes a refugee’s identity not as an outfit that can be modified with ease, but a skin that can only be shed with great difficulty. When a hook-up with a guy he meets online gets him in trouble with the authorities, Arsim faces incarceration, deportation and, worst of all, the prospect of the truth getting back to his wife and extended family. Catastrophe after catastrophe threaten to erode Arsim’s humanity, but his acute perception prevents him from sinking into glassy-eyed indifference: “I can see her sorrow,” says Arsim about a woman he visits. “I see how it travels with her everywhere she goes, it is there when she takes the house keys from her pocket, when she prepares a meal for her family, when she shakes the rugs.” Statovci keenly observes how the after-effects of war pervade every corner of its victims’ world. When Arsim finally decides to seek out Miloš after the war, we suspect there won’t be a storybook ending; Bolla shifts from being a dream-filled anticipation of the future to a taut negotiation of the past. Only in escaping the deadening circuitry of fantasy, suggests Statovci, can we begin to bear reality.  Trespasses is published by Bloomsbury (£14.99).

4/14/2022,"Two men are meeting on Zoom, as they have done twice a week for the past two years. One of them is in northern France, his cottage bathed in bright spring sunshine, two portraits of a craggy Samuel Beckett behind him. The other is in a chilly Sussex, his window casting a dull grey light. The first starts to recite. “Before Pim long before with Pim vast tracts of time,” he says. “A few traces that’s all seeing who I always.” The second interrupts to correct him. “Thoughts,” he says. “Kinds of thoughts.” The first man begins again. “Before Pim long before with Pim vast tracts of time kinds of thoughts same family diverse doubts emotions too yes emotions …” And so it goes until it is the second man’s turn to incant these mysterious words. An hour later, they are still in full flow, a ritual as mesmerising as it is strange. Phrases loop and repeat. Themes fade in and out of focus. Rhythms emerge from the unpunctuated text to form a dreamy, austere poetry. It must be hellish to memorise, which is why these two men must test their recall so frequently. The words are from Beckett’s novel How It Is. The first man is Conor Lovett, who with his wife, Judy Hegarty Lovett, is the driving force behind Gare St Lazare Ireland, a company renowned for facing Beckett head-on. The second man is Stephen Dillane, the screen star and National Theatre regular. “If you’re not careful you’ll go off on page 23 instead of the page you’re actually on,” says Conor Lovett before their line run. “You have to be on the ball.” “There are many occasions when both Conor and I feel exposed on the stage in a way that you don’t in a conventional piece,” says Dillane. “There’s no character. You’re not even sure that you’re there. You’re not sure if it’s the past or the present, so how on earth can you possibly speak?” The staging has a long history. In 2018, towards the end of a three-year residency, they performed How It Is (Part One) at the Everyman, Cork, as well as at London’s Coronet theatre. They had just given the second part an airing when the Covid pandemic struck. That led to a six-hour online version for the Dublin theatre festival in 2021. The Irish Times said it was “difficult to click pause”. Now, they are bringing the second part to London, with music by Mel Mercier and the Irish Gamelan Orchestra, and setting their sights on a live staging of the whole book. “It’s a wonderful text to stay with and revisit,” says Dillane. “It’s continually shifting, continually revealing itself and disguising itself again, while always, because of the sheer perfection of the language, maintaining your faith that there is something worth staying around for – and more.” As a veteran interpreter of Beckett works, including First Love, Molloy and The Unnamable, director Judy Hegarty Lovett is unfazed by the novel’s open-endedness. “Very often the characters in those prose works are nameless and aren’t drawn that heavily,” she says, and is delighted to have been awarded a doctorate for her PhD on the making of How It Is (Part One). “It’s less to do with specifying character and more to do with expressing thought.” Published in English in 1964, the three-part novel features an unknown narrator speaking from the darkness, his circumstances reduced to a sack, a few tins, the mud beneath him and the memory of meeting someone called Pim. With not so much as a comma, never mind a full stop, it is wide open to interpretation, even if its rhythm points to units of meaning. “Rightly or wrongly, we have both identified where the full stop is, where the paragraph break is, where the turns are, but they are entirely provisional,” says Dillane. “There are syntactical arrangements that are self-explanatory and have to be the way they are, but it’s by no means all of them.” When commentators attempt to suggest a meaning for this elliptical work, their claims can seem nebulous. Critics talk vaguely about the “human condition”. Summing up Beckett can make him seem banal. What interpretation do the actors have? “It’s something to do with a mind trying to understand itself and recognising the absurdity of that task,” says Dillane, whose repertoire also includes TS Eliot’s Four Quartets. “It seems to be an attempt by a binary, logical mind to make sense of stuff in order to continue to exist while recognising that it can’t possibly do that.” Yet, even then, the book resists. “There is no point at which you say, ‘Ah, that’s it,’” says Conor Lovett. “We go through moments when it’s crystal clear what it’s all about and then a day later we say, ‘Why did we think that?’” How It Is (Part Two) is at the Coronet theatre, London, from 20 April to 7 May",Arts/Stage,Waiting for Beckett: Stephen Dillane and Conor Lovett stage the great playwright’s novel,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/14/waiting-for-beckett-stephen-dillane-and-conor-lovett-stage-the-playwrights-novel-how-it-is
4/14/2022,"Boris Johnson should hold a vote of confidence to confirm his leadership after the conclusion of the police investigation into parties at No 10 and if local elections go badly for the Conservatives, a Tory MP has said. Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the Commons defence committee, warned that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, could “exploit” the prime minister’s image as a law-breaker following the fixed-penalty notices for attending parties in No 10.Ellwood, the MP for Bournemouth East, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think the prime minister has made his intentions clear – he wants to stay – but this is bigger than the prime minister.”He said that since the scandal risked harming the party’s reputation, Johnson owed it to the parliamentary party to hold a vote of confidence. He added that the Partygate scandal undermined the UK’s image as a “beacon of democracy” by eroding the high standards that politicians have set themselves and historically upheld. He warned that “this is something Putin will no doubt exploit – how can a lawmaker also be a law-breaker? This is not a good look.”Ellwood said he thought Johnson should resign now since the war in Ukraine was likely to continue for some time, adding it was not unprecedented for leaders to be replaced in times of crisis, citing the replacement of the UK’s head of the armed forces in December with an admiral with no combat experience. He said: “Every month, every year, European security is going to deteriorate well beyond Ukraine.“Our formidable government apparatus, our well-oiled MoD [Ministry of Defence] machine, allows us to do just that – to replace people if that is required. Our approach to Ukraine would remain consistent, so I do hope that we won’t use the war as a fig leaf to dodge these tough questions that, absolutely, we must address.” The Scottish National party’s Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, said Johnson’s position was no longer tenable. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I think the court of public opinion will give that judgment on the prime minister.“Everybody knows that parties were taking place at 10 Downing Street, everybody knows that the prime minister has been convicted.“We can talk about parliamentary procedure and the fact he has broken the ministerial code as a consequence of his behaviour. But the fundamental point here is we have the first prime minister in history who has been found guilty of breaking the law. The prime minister is there to, first and foremost, uphold the law.” It comes after the Conservative peer David Wolfson quit his role as justice minister on Wednesday following the news that Johnson and Rishi Sunak had been given a fixed-penalty notice for breaking their own Covid laws by attending a party for the prime minister’s birthday in No 10. Wolfson said he was resigning not only because of the prime minister’s own conduct but also the official response to what took place. He said the behaviour stood in stark contrast to many in society who “complied with the rules at great personal cost, and others were fined or prosecuted for similar, and sometimes apparently more trivial, offences”.",News/Politics,Senior Tory urges PM to call confidence vote if local elections go badly,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/14/senior-tory-calls-confidence-vote-pm-local-elections-badly
