3/24/2022,"A man moved out of his apartment without telling his roommates. Now he’s wondering if it was a poor choice. He took to Reddit’s “Am I the A******? (AITA)” forum for advice. His twin brother and two friends moved in with him temporarily. But when they became nightmare roommates and decided to live there permanently, the Reddit poster came up with an escape plan. Auto insurance rates are increasing in 2022 — here’s how to prepare “I moved out of my parent’s house two years ago into my own apartment,” he explained. “During this time I worked night shifts for an internet service provider as a lineman. I would frequently work from 10 p.m. until 7 a.m. or 12 a.m. until 9 a.m. When it came to renting, my contract was that I would pay rent every two months at the request of the landlord. I would frequently have my girlfriend over as she shared a similar work schedule.” “Everything changed six months ago when my twin brother and two friends who also happened to be twins decided to follow my stead and move out for the next university semester. For two months they had no issues in their own apartment. [Then they] pleaded with me to let them move in for two months so they could find a cheaper apartment as they were worried about inflation.” Buried in debt? A financial expert weighs in on how to get back on track He agreed to let them move in as long as they agreed to cover their share of the rent and groceries, help with chores and cooking and maintain a five-hour quiet period after he got back from work. “The problems began in the second month, it started with the twins quitting their jobs at the request of their mother,” he wrote. “Then their mother began to visit every two to three days and would always come during the quiet period. Aside from the visits, they all began to game with voice chats so that it would frequently wake me up. I tried to remind them of the rules only to be met with excuses.” “Behind my back mine and the twin’s mother decided that the current living situation would be permanent. I was having none of it, I secretly made preparations and plans with my girlfriend so that I could move in with her. When the twin’s mother planned an impromptu trip to their cottage I seized the opportunity and within a day I moved out. I left a note saying that I would no longer be living there and that the current rent has been paid. The next rent period and utilities are theirs to handle.” Redditors thought the poster did what he had to do. “Your brother and his friends sound like HORRIBLE roommates,” someone wrote. “They basically took the apartment from you, ignored the rules, changed their agreement without asking, and now they can pay for it,” another said. “They didn’t consult you about the situation being permanent so you granted them the same courtesy when moving out,” someone added.
