2/15/2022,"Flowers, chocolates, poetic ditties. When it comes to romantic gestures, there are no shortage of options to embrace. But perhaps nothing says “I love you” quite like embroidering a bedsheet with a message in human hair. Set to feature in a new exhibition this autumn at the Museum of London Docklands, the unusual, if macabre, token of affection is a 300-year old memento of a story replete with romance, tragedy and insurrection.  The sheet was taken from the Tower of London, where it had been used on the bed of James Radclyffe, the third Earl of Derwentwater, who was awaiting execution for his involvement in the first Jacobite rebellion in 1715, an attempt to put the “Old Pretender” – James, son of James II and VII of England and Scotland – on the throne. Despite raising troops, Radclyffe and the other Jacobite rebels were defeated at the Battle of Preston. While efforts were made to secure a pardon for Radclyffe, the aristocrat – a grandson of Charles II by the monarch’s mistress Moll Davis – was beheaded for treason on 24 February 1716, aged just 26. Radclyffe was later featured in numerous novels and ballads, from Sir Walter Scott’s Rob Roy to Lord Derwentwater’s Farewell. But his story was also immortalised in his laundry. In a gesture of remembrance, Radclyffe’s young widow, Anna Maria Radclyffe, embroidered the bottom of the linen sheet in cross-stitch with the words: “The sheet OFF MY dear dear Lord’s Bed in the wretched Tower of London February 1716 x Ann C of Darwent=Waters”. “The interesting thing is that it doesn’t look as if [the sheet] was used for very long. So it’s likely that it was only used for the four months that he was in [the Tower], awaiting execution,” said Beverley Cook, curator of social history at the Museum of London. Cook added that Radclyffe’s wife was allowed to stay with him during that time. “It would be lovely to think that they were lying together beneath this sheet,” said Cook. “Obviously, we can’t prove that, but it’s likely that she conceived their daughter at that time.” Cook said the message is thought to have been embroidered by Anna Maria after she fled to Brussels to raise her children as Catholics. She died of smallpox in 1723. While the handiwork may seem romantic, it is also somewhat macabre: instead of using linen thread – as was used, possibly by nuns, to embroider hearts and flowers on the sheet – the message was stitched with human hair. But quite whose hair remains something of a mystery. When the sheet was presented to the museum in 1934 it came with the message that the hair was Anna Maria’s. However, there is another possibility. After his death, Radclyffe’s heart was given to an Augustinian monastery in Paris, but his body – with his head sewn back on – was given to his wife. “That would have given her the opportunity of removing some of his hair. And we do know that, obviously, taking locks of hair was quite a common thing for people to do,” said Cook, adding that Anna Maria is known to have kept some of Radclyffe’s hair in a locket. Another possibility, said Cook, is that the hair was from both husband and wife, noting that it appears to have two different colours. But Cook said the bedsheet is more than a symbol of love. “It is also a sort of relic to Catholic martyrdom,” she said. Among other items in the Executions exhibition is clothing said to have been worn by Charles I when he was beheaded, as well as love tokens – discs resembling flattened coins that were inscribed in their cells by those condemned to death or transportation. One token, dated 1826 and given by the 20-year old thief George Wright to Ann Lee, bears, like the Radclyffe bedsheet, a poignant message of heartache: “In my dismal cell I lie / In sorrow grief and woe, / For my time it seems so long, / My doom I wish to know.”",Arts/Culture,Love note to Jacobite rebel embroidered in human hair to go on show,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/14/love-note-to-jacobite-rebel-embroidered-in-human-hair-to-go-on-show
2/15/2022,"Hundreds of yellow-headed blackbirds have been filmed appearing to fall from the sky, some of them dying, in mysterious circumstances in the northern Mexican city of Cuauhtémoc. The cause of death remains unclear but experts said it was most likely the flock was “flushed” from above by a predatory bird swooping down to make a catch.  The footage from a security camera shows a flock of migratory birds descending on to houses like a cloud of black smoke. Most birds manage to fly off but subsequent footage shows carcasses of the distinctive black and yellow birds scattered on streets of the city. WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENTSecurity footage shows a flock of yellow-headed blackbirds drop dead in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua pic.twitter.com/mR4Zhh979K The incident happened on the morning on 7 February, according to local reports. The birds tend to breed farther north, in the US and Canada, and migrate south for winter in Mexico. According to the local paper El Heraldo de Chihuahua, which first reported the story, a veterinarian suggested blame for the incident could lie with high levels of pollution, driven by the use of wood-burning heaters, agrochemicals, and cold weather in the area. Another suggestion was that the birds were electrocuted while resting on power lines. There was speculation on social media that it could have been caused by 5G technology. But Dr Richard Broughton, an ecologist with the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, said that although he could not see a raptor in the footage, he was 99% sure it was caused by a predatory bird. A predator could have made the birds swirl tightly and driven them towards the ground, with higher birds forcing lower ones to crash into the buildings or the ground. “This looks like a raptor like a peregrine or hawk has been chasing a flock, like they do with murmurating starlings, and they have crashed as the flock was forced low,” he said. “You can see that they act like a wave at the beginning, as if they are being flushed from above.” Dr Alexander Lees, a senior lecturer in conservation biology at Manchester Metropolitan University, agreed. “For my part and from one video and no toxicology, I’d still say the most probable cause is the flock murmurating to avoid a predatory raptor and hitting the ground,” he said. “There always seems to be a kneejerk response to blame environmental pollutants, but collisions with infrastructure are very common. In a tightly packed flock, the birds are following the movements of the bird in front rather than actually interpreting their wider surroundings, so it isn’t unexpected that such events happen occasionally.” The deaths of 225 starlings in Anglesey in December 2019 were later discovered to have been caused by them diving into the tarmac, possibly after being chased by a predatory bird and failing to pull up in time.",News/Environment,"Why did birds fall from sky in Mexico?

2/15/2022,"After a relatively light year at the Super Bowl for Hollywood, thanks to Covid, of course, the studios and streamers were back to business at the weekend, securing $7m spots for their shiniest of wares.  Here’s a rundown of what you might have missed: The phenomenal success of the most recent Spider-Man instalment (about to take over Avatar’s mammoth box office) and the film’s many, many cameos have upped the ante for the next Marvel adventure, something the new tease of Sam Raimi’s Doctor Strange 2 is certainly aware of. While we knew from the last trailer that Elizabeth Olsen’s tortured Wanda would be a major part, the new ad has confirmed a rumour that Patrick Stewart would be starring as well. It was a mere voice tease (and not enough to 100% confirm that he’ll be playing X-Men’s Professor Xavier although it seems very very likely) but just that alone managed to briefly break the internet. We’ll find out how their worlds collide in May. The Super Bowl also offered up a new look at Amazon’s ambitious new Lord of the Rings series, which has cost a reported $465m to make. It certainly looks epic in scale, but the niggling question remains: do we really need this? Peter Jackson’s original series remains virtually perfect and still all-too-recent and nothing yet, not even this handsome trailer, has shown us that Middle Earth needs revisiting. A quick look at Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum’s The Lost City, a knowing spin on Romancing the Stone, doesn’t really offer us that much we haven’t already seen in the initial trailers. The story of a romance novelist who finds herself in a real adventure has plenty going for it – Bullock returning to physical comedy, Daniel Radcliffe as a bad guy, a role for the extremely funny Patti Harrison, a piss-taking cameo from Brad Pitt – but three trailers have now shown essentially the same moments on a loop (someone over at Paramount is very proud of the line “What is this, Taken? Am I took-en?”) so let’s hope there’s more to be found when it hits cinemas next month. Probably the most anticipated trailer of the evening (that actually dropped in the morning) was for the film that had been most shrouded in secrecy up until now – Jordan Peele’s latest “social thriller” Nope, out this summer. The rather divisive title is not really explained in the first tease, but it’s quite likely meant to mean Not Of Planet Earth. Maybe. Because the Oscar-winning film-maker has turned his sights up to the sky, after going underground with Us, for a film that’s about something evil sucking people up from above (comparisons to 2004’s The Forgotten are already clogging up Twitter). Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer, Steven Yeun and some very scared horses star. After the success of last month’s Scream, the legacy sequel – aka the one that brings back the old to mingle with the new – continues with force this year with our first real look at the inevitable greatest hits sequel Jurassic World: Dominion. The last film brought back BD Wong and a cameo-ing Jeff Goldblum to join Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard but this time they return with both Sam Neill and Laura Dern, an exciting prospect for hardcore fans. The trailer has some promising moments but there’s an awful lot here to be juggled – despite the familiar faces, it’ll be the lesser-known DeWanda Wise who leads – so whether all balls can be kept up in the air remains to be seen. Despite all of the pre-release fun-poking (fans ripped the character design in the trailer so much that Paramount tweaked it for the actual movie), 2020’s Sonic the Hedgehog became one of the year’s biggest, and sadly only, hits with $319m worldwide. The inevitable sequel is being rushed out this April and a headache-inducing Super Bowl spot, introducing new villain Knuckles voices by Idris Elba, does little to explain the appeal to OG game fans who wisely skipped the last film. It’s looking like a rather dark year for Marvel, after the night’s horror-tinged Doctor Strange 2 tease and now this, a second look at their new Disney+ series, Moon Knight, recently described as “brutal” by Marvel boss Kevin Feige. Oscar Isaac’s British accent remains … a decision, but there’s plenty to get excited about here, including a grizzled Ethan Hawke and some stunning on-location imagery.",Arts/Culture,Super Bowl 2022: the biggest new movie and TV trailers,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/14/moon-knight-nope-lord-of-the-rings-trailers-super-bowl-2022
2/15/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has turned to his sports psychologist Sascha Lense to try and rebuild Manchester United’s confidence and end their habits of losing leads. United have drawn 1-1 in each of their last three games, all after scoring first and having an advantage at the break, resulting in the loss of four points and their elimination from the FA Cup. In Rangnick’s brief reign, they have already drawn five times after being ahead and the interim manager accepted their belief has suffered.  He brought in Lense, who had worked with him at RB Leipzig, to address the mental side of the game and has turned to an old ally to address his players, both individually and as a squad, in an attempt to make United more resilient. Rangnick said: “In 11 of 13 games since I arrived we score the first goal and were 1-0 up but we only won half. When you are 1-0 up in three consecutive games concede an equaliser, this affects the mindset of the players. They say: ‘We should have been 3-0 or 4-0 up and all of a sudden it is 1-1.’ If we concede early in the second half, it affects the confidence of the players. They are human beings, not robots. I spoke to Sascha and we speak regularly about that. The only thing we can do is speak to the players, one by one, to the group and the whole team. “Number one, we have to be more effective to score a second and a third goal and just kill a game off. But if that doesn’t happen, stick to the gameplan, stay solid, stay tactically disciplined. I look to all those goals we conceded in the second halves and it was just too easy.” United face Brighton in the Premier League on Tuesday night.",Sport/Football,Rangnick turns to sports psychologist to end Manchester United’s drawing habit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/14/rangnick-turns-to-sports-psychologist-to-end-manchester-uniteds-drawing-habit
2/15/2022,"Coleen Rooney has suffered a serious setback in her legal battle with Rebekah Vardy, after a high court judge refused to grant permission to add Vardy’s former agent to the legal proceedings. Rooney’s lawyers had attempted to bring Caroline Watt into the “Wagatha Christie” case, alleging she misused Rooney’s private information and worked in cahoots with Vardy to leak stories to the Sun.  However, Justice Steyn refused the request to add Watt on the basis that the application had been made too late and would delay the main libel trial by up to a year, which would be unfair on Vardy. The judge’s 25,000-word ruling followed two days of hearings at the high court last week, where some of the UK’s most expensive lawyers battled over which WhatsApp messages should be admissible evidence, who exactly called whom a “nasty bitch”, and how a mobile phone containing potential evidence was accidentally dropped into the North Sea. The case is due to go to a full trial in May. Despite repeated pleas by judges for both women to settle the case, neither side has been willing to back down. The total costs have run into millions of pounds – dwarfing any likely financial damages that may be awarded at the end of the case. The complete collapse in the relationship between the two women began at the end of 2019, when Rooney ran a sting operation to identify who had been leaking stories from her private Instagram to journalists at the Sun newspaper. This led Rooney, the wife of the Derby County manager Wayne Rooney, to make the now-infamous accusation: “It’s……… Rebekah Vardy’s account”. Vardy, the wife of the Leicester City footballer Jamie Vardy, strongly denied she was the individual leaking stories to the Sun and responded by suing Rooney for libel over the accusation. More than two years later, the case continues to wind its way through the court system, with ever more excruciating details being revealed to the public. An earlier ruling in the case found that the meaning of Rooney’s post was that Vardy was herself personally leaking stories to the Sun. As a result, any libel trial could hinge on proving who – if anyone – was using Vardy’s Instagram account to obtain and leak information to the Sun. Rooney’s representatives told the court that if Vardy won her claim on the basis that she was not the specific individual who leaked the information to the Sun, then Rooney would be left without “vindication”. Last week’s hearings turned the spotlight on Watt, Vardy’s long-term agent, with the court hearing the pair discussed Rooney and whether to leak material to the media. It was told the pair described Rooney as a “cunt” in private WhatsApp messages, had an ongoing financial relationship with the Sun, and discussed providing stories to the newspaper’s journalists. The court heard Vardy and Watt had discussed a post on Rooney’s private Instagram when her car had been damaged in January 2019. Vardy told Watt she “would love to leak those stories”. The case has been plagued with issues around lost evidence. Shortly after Rooney’s lawyers asked to search Watt’s mobile phone for potential information, the agent accidentally dropped the device into the North Sea from the side of a boat when it was hit by a wave. Data from her backup messages was also accidentally deleted while in the process of uploading it to her solicitors. A request to search messages on Jamie Vardy’s phone was also refused, with the footballer stating his WhatsApp account had been hacked. The laptop used by Vardy during the crucial period also “no longer functions”, while messages between Rebekah Vardy and the Sun journalist Andy Halls also appear to have been deleted.",News/UK news,‘Wagatha Christie’: blow to Coleen Rooney as judge refuses to bring in Rebekah Vardy’s ex-agent,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/14/wagatha-christie-case-coleen-rooney-rebekah-vardy-ex-agent
2/15/2022,"Though the exact centenary does not fall until October, the BBC is spreading celebrations of its anniversary throughout the year and across its networks. The BBC orchestras, some of which are as old as the corporation itself, got their contribution in early, with a weekend of concerts from each of the seven current ensembles, all broadcast live on Radio 3 from their home halls. The importance of these orchestras in serious music-making in the UK across the past 100 years can’t be overstated. While their independent counterparts around the country have always had to keep one eye on the box office, mindful of the need to attract audiences and to tailor their concerts accordingly, the BBC bands have always had a freer hand, and have consistently been able to tackle more ambitious repertoire – works that were more demanding of resources and rehearsal time, or were unlikely to attract large audiences. And though their programmes nowadays may be less adventurous than they were, say, in the 1960s and 70s, when William Glock was the controller of music, the BBC remains the most important champion of large-scale new works in the UK, responsible for more premieres each year than all the country’s other orchestras put together.  But though this collection of anniversary concerts had been coordinated to some extent – each programme included at least one work composed or first performed around the time of the BBC’s foundation, and one more or less new piece – it never seemed to generate the sense of pioneering ambition it perhaps ought to have conveyed. Not many of the rather motley collection of works felt truly celebratory or adventurous, and disappointingly few received performances that were truly memorable either. The subfusc tone was set on the opening evening, in the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s concert conducted in the Barbican by Semyon Bychkov, which ended with the most lugubrious performance of Ravel’s orchestration of Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition (first performed in 1922), one could imagine. Before it, the pianist Kirill Gerstein had been the nimble soloist in Strauss’s Burleske, while the concert had begun with the UK premiere of Bryce Dessner’s Mari, which Bychkov had first performed last year with the Czech Philharmonic, and which like several of the new works in the series was composed during lockdown, and intended as a “reflection on the pastoral”, though it begins with rather threatening Sibelius-like brass, before quoting Dvořák and Mahler. The BBC National Orchestra of Wales’s concert from Hoddinott Hall, Cardiff the following lunchtime opened with the UK premiere of another lockdown piece, Sebastian Hilli’s Miracle, another rather indulgent, stylistically diverse piece of orchestral rhetoric. Conductor Ryan Bancroft followed it with Copland’s Appalachian Spring (the suite only, alas), Grace Williams’s Elegy for strings, and the suite from Stravinsky’s ballet Pulcinella, diverse 20th-century repertoire that seems to bring the best out of him, and from his orchestra too. Later that day, after the BBC Concert Orchestra had joined the party from the Colosseum, Watford with a programme that began and ended with Eric Coates, and also including film music by Anne Dudley, and a short piece, Brink, by the winner of the BBC’s Young Composer Competition, Xia Leon Sloane, the focus switched to Manchester. In the Bridgewater Hall the BBC Philharmonic and its chief conductor Omer Meir Wellber offered another rather arbitrary programme. But this one was redeemed by the sheer panache of the performances, from Hindemith’s brittle, manic Kammermusik I to Tippett’s sumptuous Ritual Dances from his opera The Midsummer Marriage, via the baroque potpourri of Aziza Sadikova’s BBC commission, Marionettes, and a dashing account of Schumann’s Piano Concerto, with Giulia Contaldo as the last-minute replacement soloist. The Ulster Orchestra’s Sunday-morning contribution from the Ulster Hall under Andrew Gourlay was entirely home grown, pairing Michael McHale’s heroic performance of Hamilton Harty’s overblown Piano Concerto – the only piano concerto I know that includes a tam-tam in its orchestration! - with Conor Mitchell’s rather John Adams-like Democracy Dances. Later in London’s Milton Court, the BBC Singers built their programme around Vaughan Williams and Howard Goodall, interleaving movements from Vaughan Williams’ Mass in G minor with a variety of short choral settings in the first half, and devoting the second to the European premiere of Goodall’s rather beautiful and touching Unconditional Love, a cantata setting poems written during lockdown. That left the BBC Scottish Symphony to end the weekend, with a programme from City Halls, Glasgow, which was also the orchestra’s first appearance with Ryan Wigglesworth since he was announced as its next chief conductor from September. Here finally was a programme with a real shape and sense of purpose, with three works from the early 1920s – Kurt Weill’s rarely heard suite Quodlibet, Strauss’s Hymne an die Liebe, with Katherine Broderick as the radiant, soaring soloist, and Berg’s Three Fragments from Wozzeck – and Wigglesworth himself supplying the new work in the form of his epigrammatic Five Waltzes for viola and orchestra, played by Scott Dickinson. Even with highlights such as this, though, there was something a little random about the weekend, rather less of a celebration and statement of intent than it could have been.

2/15/2022,"Petrol prices have surged to a record high and are expected to climb further in coming weeks, adding to the burden on UK households’ already squeezed budgets. The AA said petrol surpassed 148p a litre on Sunday, rising above the previous record high of 147.72p on 21 November last year.  Diesel prices have also risen, with the average price for a litre at 151.57p, compared with 151.10p on 20 November 2021. The increases have been driven by growing demand after the reopening of global economies and mounting tensions between Russia and Ukraine. A barrel of Brent crude, the global benchmark for oil, traded above $95 (£76.25) a barrel on Monday, its highest in seven years. “The cost of living crisis has been ratcheted up yet another notch, tightening the vice on family spending when it faces other pressures from impending domestic energy cost and tax increases,” said Luke Bosdet, the AA’s fuel price spokesperson. A poll conducted by the AA on 15,335 of its members found 43% of motorists were cutting back on car use, other consumer spending or both. This figure rose to 59% among younger drivers and 53% for lower-income motorists. Inflation is running at an almost 30-year high of 5.4%, and official figures on Wednesday are expected to show more pain for households and heap pressure on the Bank of England to increase interest rates again. An RAC’s fuel spokesperson, Simon Williams, said: “Petrol has unfortunately hit a frightening new high of 148.02p which takes filling a 55-litre family car to an eye-watering £81.41. With the oil price teetering on the brink of $100 a barrel and retailers keen to pass on the increase in wholesale fuel quickly, new records could now be set on a daily basis in the coming weeks. “The oil price is rising due to tensions between Russia – the world’s third-biggest oil producer – and Ukraine, along with oil production remaining out of kilter with demand as the world emerges from the pandemic. As a result drivers in the UK could be in for an even worse ride as pump prices look certain to go up even more. “On a positive note, retailer margins – which were the reason drivers paid overly high prices in December and January – have now returned to more normal levels of around 7p a litre. “We urge the big four supermarkets, which dominate fuel sales, to play fair with drivers and not to make a bad situation on the forecourt any worse by upping their margins again.”",Lifestyle/Money,‘Tightening the vice on spending’: UK petrol prices hit all-time high,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/14/uk-petrol-prices-hit-all-time-high
