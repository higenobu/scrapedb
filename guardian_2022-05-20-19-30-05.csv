5/20/2022,"I have just got back from a gorgeous weekend in Bath, after doing a book event with proper writers Marian Keyes and Nina Stibbe at the literary festival. I was high as a kite on my return. Because sure, I love to talk about books and writing, meet amazing authors and fellow bookworms, and revel in the cornucopia of delights offered by reading temples such as Toppings bookshop and Mr B’s Emporium. But do you know what I really, really love? A hotel. An hotel, if you’re a bit of a twunt, but either way – a place where you can go and eat, drink, sleep between clean sheets, shower in an immaculate bathroom, breakfast from a variety of increasingly decadent choices (fruit-toast-cereal-full-English-attenuated-as-best-suits-you-and-any-hangover’s-requirements) and repeat without having to do anything at all for yourself. One 24-hour span on your own in a hotel is equivalent to one week’s holiday en famille. The restorative bang for your buck ratio is unsurpassed. At least until a friend remarked that this was because “staying at a hotel is the equivalent of having a wife”. And this irrefutable truth unrestored me immediately and absolutely. Well, I’m enjoying this new laissez-faire version of the Queen we’ve got, aren’t you? First there was last week’s announcement that she wouldn’t be attending any of this year’s garden parties – despite them being, yunno, just out in her back garden. Then she binned off the state opening of parliament. Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown – but not if you send it as your stand-in and make your son read out the speech instead. “Episodic mobility problems” were cited by the palace, which I like to think is royal-speak for “ballasted with sudden contempt for the whole goddamn lot of ya”, as she rallied sufficiently to attend the Royal Windsor Horse Show a few days later and whoop it up when her horse was declared a supreme champion in the Highland Class 64 event. And then there was her deadpan shrug at the end of Alan Titchmarsh’s emetic speech at the opening of the platinum jubilee celebrations declaring her to have been “the constant heartbeat in this nation” for the last 70 years. If you haven’t seen it, do take a look. I cannot do justice to the majesty of Her Maj’s moment. It’s as if at 96, after a lifetime of dutiful dutying, she has decided to have her rebellious teens, carefree 20s, menopause madness and merry widowhood all at once. For the first time in my life, I find myself looking to the monarch as an inspiration. Carpe diem, crown or no. I took one of my occasional deep dives into the recesses of my 11-year-old son’s schoolbag and brought out – along with some unidentified rotting organic matter, forgotten homework and Shergar – an invitation to an end-of-year junior disco organised by the school. “Why didn’t you give me this?” I said, despite knowing full well why (it is because, like his parents, he can’t dance, hates noise and pales with fear at the thought of enforced fun). “Because I’m not going.” “Why not?” “Because of the disco. And everyone will be there.” “The Edwardian actor Ernest Thesiger,” said my husband, who prefers to swoop in to dispense his six penn’orth of wisdom only when it is least wanted, “when asked on his return from the trenches halfway through world war one what it was like, replied: ‘Oh, my dear, the noise! The people!” We waited for him to leave. “I think,” I said carefully, “that you should go.” “Would you have?” he asked. “Did you, ever?” I did indeed go to my first disco at 11. My attendance was the result of a knockdown, drag-out fight between me and my mother, and there was only ever going to be one victor. “You’re going,” she snarled as she hauled my protesting form down the front path, “if I have to drag you there myself.” But by going, I came to know myself. I look at my child. The 35 years I have lived since then concertina, shrink and vanish. I don’t have a leg to stand on. But he should go, and for the same reasons I did. And he might enjoy it once he’s there. If not, well, we all need some iron in the soul eventually. But I have neither my mother’s will or conviction. “Here,” I say, handing him my phone. “Give Grandma a ring. Tell her all about it.” In the ne plus ultra of power moves, Coleen and Wayne have gone on holiday for the last day of the Wagatha Christie (AKA The Scousetrap) trial, leaving Rebekah Vardy to listen to closing statements on her own. For those of you to whom the above sentence means nothing – ‘tis fine. Go on with your lives. Nothing about them needs to change. But for those of us who have been gorging on the only news story of 2022 that is of gloriously little import, this final flourish as the curtain falls on the Rooney v Vardy libel trial is everything we could have hoped for. They say there are never any real winners in litigation (apart from the lawyers) but that’s only if you think in narrow terms of verdicts, damages and the like. Here, high-street fashion has won, amateur detective skills have won, the viewing public has won. And, of course, whoever came up with Wagatha Christie and, especially, Scousetrap should win a lifetime’s supply of Primark tops and Chanel handbags. It’s been a joy. After watching the odd new sci-fi/love story/conspiracy drama Night Sky on Amazon Prime, I find myself disappearing down a rabbit hole and binge-watching The X-Files. It is a very convoluted exercise in nostalgia. It speaks of a long-lost time when the idea of a government competent enough to engage in large-scaleenduring cover-ups was unproblematic, and outlandish beliefs and crazy conspiracy theories were imaginative feats by the writers to be enjoyed as just that. Now, of course, thanks to the advent of the internet and the retreat of democracy, the situation is almost entirely reversed. The good thing is that since Mulder and Scully first appeared in 1993, I have acquired my own home, a fridge filled with wine, and independent agency. In other words, I can drink to forget the new truth that’s out there. Happy weekend, everybody!",News/UK news,Digested week: this laissez-faire version of the Queen is an inspiration | Lucy Mangan,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/digested-week-this-laissez-faire-version-of-the-queen-is-an-inspiration
5/20/2022,"A deadly bacteria outbreak in baby formula and an ongoing formula shortage stem from issues some economists characterize as “rot” in the nation’s economic system: prioritization of shareholder wealth and consolidation. The embattled baby formula producer Abbott used windfall profits to enrich investors instead of replacing failing equipment that was likely injecting the dangerous bacteria into its infant nutritional products, financial records and whistleblower documents show. Abbott detected bacteria eight times as its net profits soared by 94% between 2019 and 2021. And just as its tainted formula allegedly began sickening a number of babies, with two deaths reported, the company increased dividends to shareholders by over 25% while announcing a stock buyback program worth $5bn. “Abbott chose to prioritize shareholders by issuing billions of dollars in stock buybacks instead of making productive investments,” said Rakeen Mabud, chief economist for the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic advocacy group. “It’s important that we have high standards for something as vital as baby formula.” Abbott denies share buybacks hurt safety but the controversy has some economists calling for stricter anti-trust enforcement, bans on buybacks and limits on dividends. The tainted product triggered a February recall of three popular Abbott infant formulas, including Similac, when batches likely tainted with the rare Cronobacter bacteria killed two infants and sickened two more. The FDA and CDC reported the babies “consumed formula produced at the Sturgis, Michigan” facility before they got sick, and the bacteria “may have contributed” to their deaths. Abbott halted production at the Sturgis plant, the nation’s largest, but the company has since downplayed the controversy and claimed “there is no evidence to link our formulas to these infant illnesses”. Federal investigators said it was not clear either way. “Right from the get-go we were limited in our ability to determine with a causal link whether the product was linked to these four cases, because we only had sequences on two,” FDA’s food director Susan Mayne said in a media briefing on Monday, ABC News reported. Regardless, the operation remains paused, and the deep cut into the nation’s formula supply is partly a result of consolidation: Abbott and three other companies control nearly 90% of the market, Mabud said, and Abbott alone makes 43% of US formula. “When Abbott halted production that whole market was disrupted, and the result was desperate parents around the country couldn’t feed their babies,” Mabud added. “We don’t have a resilient supply chain, not for baby formula and not for a whole host of other goods.” In the two years ahead of the recall, Abbott’s net profits jumped from $3.6bn to $7.1bn, its operating margins improved, and revenue in the US pediatric nutritional division increased by about 16%, Securities and Exchange Commission filings show. Company executives in earnings calls attributed the new pediatric nutritional revenue to market share gains and price increases, while covid tests were a boon to the parent company. The federal whistleblower complaint alleged some of the Sturgis plant’s equipment that caused the bacteria to get in the product “was failing and in need of repair”, and company management was aware of the issue for up to seven years ahead of the outbreak. “A number of product flow pipes were pitting and leaving pinholes. This allowed bacteria to enter the system and, at times, led to bacteria not being adequately cleaned out in clean-in-place washes,” the report reads. “This, in turn, caused product flowing through the pipes to pick up the bacteria that was trapped in the defective areas of the pipe.” The problems are not limited to ageing equipment, according to the whistleblower. Management at the plant also falsified records, improperly trained employees, and successfully hid health and safety risks from the Food and Drug Administration auditors in 2019. Companies like Abbott are “using every product as a personal ATM” by cutting corners to maximize profits, said Moe Tkacik, a senior fellow at the American Economic Liberties Project. In the short term, Joe Biden has invoked the Defense Production Act to speed production of infant formula and authorized flights to import supply from overseas, while the FDA approved a deal with Abbott to bring the Sturgis plant back online within several weeks. But long-term solutions will require more bold steps, Tkacik said, like a ban on buybacks and restrictions on dividends. She acknowledged such ideas are dismissed as “socialistic”, but noted buybacks were illegal until 1982 because they were considered a form of manipulation. Annual buyback program expenditures among S&P 500 companies are often exceeding research and development or other investment, Tkacik said. Restrictions on dividends are reasonable for companies that receive federal funding or whose largest customers are federal programs, like Abbott, she added. A spokesperson for Abbott said: “Stock buybacks are not impacting our ability to invest in or reopen our Sturgis manufacturing facility; in fact, our strong balance sheet has allowed us to invest in our facilities, including in Sturgis, and will help us make additional investments and more quickly restart the facility.” The Senate Finance committee chair Ron Wyden on Wednesday requested information about Abbott’s stock buyback program. Mabud said Congress and the president need to use the “wide array of policy tools that are on the table” to address consolidation, including breaking up companies when appropriate, empowering the FTC, taxing companies appropriately, and investing in diversification in consolidated industries. “We need to make sure children can get the nutrients that they need – I think we can all agree on that – and these giant corporations … need to be held to account for the vulnerabilities that they’ve created and the quality of the product that they put on the market,” Mabud said.",News/Environment,"Abbott enriched shareholders as faulty plant needed repairs, records show",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/20/abbott-baby-formula-shareholder-profits

5/20/2022,"Imagine being one of the more than 200,000 people in America sentenced to life in prison. And then, after decades behind bars, laws are changed, your sentence is shortened, and the parole board approves of your release. You become tasked with reentering society, finding stable housing, employment and a healthy social life. These are things that everyone seeks, formerly incarcerated or not. But for people who’ve spent time behind bars, and more specifically the people who were serving life sentences – the lifers – these challenges can be insurmountable. To the many lifers released early in California in recent years, their prison record is like a scarlet letter following them wherever they go – a different sort of life sentence. Last month, photographer Brandon Tauzsik and I published the multimedia documentary project, Facing Life. The Pulitzer Center-backed project follows the paths of eight people who served decades behind bars, mainly as lifers. All eight have been recently released, due to a decades-old supreme court ruling, changed California laws and improved individual behaviors, as well as connections to advocacy groups championing the causes of incarcerated people. Most of them were given a $200 debit card upon leaving the prison gates, directions to a halfway house to live in for six months and a parole officer to check in with. Beyond that, they had their connections to friends and family, but a question remains unanswered for them: who is there to ensure their successful return to the community? The eight people hail from across California, have spent time in different prisons, and they all represent a small part of the state’s massive prison population – the second largest in the US, a country that incarcerates the most people in the world. In 2011, the US Supreme Court ruled in Brown v Plata that health conditions within California’s overcrowded prisons were a violation of people’s eighth amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. At the time of the case, the state’s prison system, which was designed to hold roughly 85,000 people, was housing 156,000 people. The state was ordered to decrease its prison population by a minimum of 46,000 people, with the target population of 137.5% of the capacity the system was designed to hold, or a max of roughly 110,000 people behind bars. The state later passed a handful of laws and made efforts to reduce the population in its facilities. The Covid-19 pandemic further forced prison officials to attempt to create space within the state’s overcrowded prisons by releasing people, moving people to other facilities and slowing the intake process. In 2020, the state’s prison population dropped by more than 27,000 people, the largest ever one-year dip in the state’s prison population. But even with these changes to laws, “realignment” efforts, closures of prisons and more, the prison population – which finally dropped to about 102% capacity, or just over 95,000 people at the end of 2021 – has recently begun to rise once again. As of 11 May, the state’s prison population is currently at 113% of its designed capacity, or 97,074 people in a system supposed to house nearly 85,330 people. That’s an increase of 579 people since this time last year, and more than 270 people since just last week. In California, as is the case in most states, people of color – specifically Black people – are overrepresented in prison populations. As of March of this year, Black people accounted for 29% of the state’s prison population, but only 6% of the state’s overall population. The legacy of mandatory minimums and the war on drugs, coupled with the three strikes law, which advocates are currently fighting to overturn, are still impacting communities in California – inside and outside of prison walls. Travielle Pope swims with his sons James and Dmonta near their home in West Covina, California. Originally sentenced to life without the possibility of parole, Travielle served 26 years in prison before being released in 2018. The state is currently experiencing a push-and-pull when it comes to theories on what justice looks like. On one side of the coin, there’s the “tough on crime” approach, and on the other there is the “restorative justice” ethos. This is a battle that’s reflected in prisons, communities and legislative sessions all across the country, according to Alexandra Bailey, campaign strategist for the End Life Imprisonment campaign at The Sentencing Project. Bailey said it’s clear that this country’s carceral rate hasn’t improved public safety and falls severely short of adequate solutions. She believes being reactive to tough on crime legislation is imperative to keep the US from moving backward, but it is important to push for progressive laws. “This is not working. Mass policing. Mass incarceration. Mass supervision has not worked, so we need to move on to something else,” Bailey said. “This is not solution-oriented, this is punishment-oriented. And we have already spent as much money as anyone else in the world on punishment, to no avail.” Several Second Look bills, which would allow people who are incarcerated for long periods of time to apply to a judge to determine whether or not continued punishment is necessary, are making their way through the legislative process in a number of states, including Oregon, Vermont, Washington and Virginia. It’s a mechanism to gain release, added Bailey, whose main focus is serving those sentenced without the possibility of parole (LWOPs). She is often asked: why them? Bailey brings up the example of Jamie Meade, who was recently featured in The Sentencing Project’s report, Felony Murder: An On-Ramp for Extreme Sentencing. Bailey said Meade is incarcerated for the commission of a crime, meaning he wasn’t the person who pulled the trigger. “He’s serving a life without parole sentence, and during that time he’s got time he’s gotten a Bachelor’s degree, a Master’s degree, and is currently working on (another) Master’s degree in the Chicago Theological Seminary,” Bailey said, adding that the program made alterations to allow him to participate. And then there’s Susan Brown, another person serving life without parole. While she was pregnant her former spouse stabbed and sexually assaulted her. Brown was later convicted for killing him during that attack, Bailey said, adding that Brown is also an extraordinary artist. The amount of people serving life sentences is staggering. About one out of every seven people behind bars, over 200,000 people, are serving life sentences, according to a 2020 report by The Sentencing Project. In California’s state prisons, about 33,000 people are serving life sentences, according to this report by the Public Policy Institute of California. Add to this discussion that former lifers have a recidivism rate of around 1%, and the picture becomes even more clear. “If we really believe that people need to pay a penance to society, sitting in there really doesn’t make our society better. Them being out here and taking people off of that bad path – that’s what we need from them. And that’s why we should focus on the lifer population,” Bailey said. Facing Life was made possible with support from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. On 11 May, Alexandra Bailey hosted a panel discussion with Myra Burns and Fahim Reese, two of the eight people from Facing Life. They were joined by the creators of the project, writer Pendarvis Harshaw and photographer Brandon Tauszik. To view this discussion, click here.

5/20/2022,"The California poppy, Eschscholzia californica, is one of those easy, breezy things that no garden should be without. It has the laid-back, sunny attitude you might expect from a Californian. All you have to do is sow direct by scattering some seeds in the right spot. If it is left to set seed, it will effortlessly dance around the garden and appear exactly where it should. It loves to bask in the sun in free-draining soil – for example, on a gravel path edge, a rock garden or even a crack in a wall; but will do equally well in a container with plenty of grit added for drainage. It hates disturbance – even the gentlest of handling as you remove it from a module tray can throw it off course. Which is why I like to sow it now, when the soils are warm and germination is quick, and keep sowing through to the end of June. It is important that the seedlings don’t get shaded out by other emerging plants, which is the only other way to upset it. Don’t bury the seed – it needs light to germinate; make sure that the ground is weed-free, removing the roots of anything like dandelion or docks as they are the sort to do the shading out. Scatter the seed liberally, water in, and that’s it. The searing orange flowers of these poppies works well alongside purple: the combination of verbenas and California poppies is an instant winner. And they can mingle well with lavenders and salvias, such as Salvia nemorosa ‘Caradonna’. I love the subtle combination of underplanting them with Echinacea paradoxa, which has reflexed, pale buttery ray florets: the two offset each other perfectly. There are some lovely California poppy cultivars out there; from the palest ‘Ivory Castle’ and ‘Rose Chiffon’ to the deep orange peel of ‘Aurantiaca’ or ‘Orange King’. There are the ruffled petals of ‘Frilled Rose’ in pink and brilliant yellows in among orange shades of E. californica subsp mexicana ‘Sun Shades’, and the unusual ‘Purple Gleam’, which has managed to pull a lovely deep lilac out of the gene pool and works very well with the blue-grey lacy foliage. But if you want to grow for wildlife, stick to the species. It’s actually very low in nectar, but what it doesn’t have in sweetness it has in protein, which is essential for egg production. It is one of the most pollen-rich plants you can grow, but because it is not wind pollinated, won’t cause allergies. Finally, the species makes the most wonderful tea. You can use aerial parts: flowers, stems, leaves, fresh or dried. It is a gentle tea that can reduce anxiety and aid sleep. It contains none of the alkaloids associated with opium poppies, so it’s safe for everyone, including children. It tastes delicious and is utterly uplifting, much like these sunny blooms.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Now is the perfect time for some California poppy dreamin’ | Alys Fowler,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/20/most-versatile-flower-in-your-garden-california-poppy
5/20/2022,"When it comes to taboo-busting, Anupama Chandrasekhar has form. She refashioned Ibsen’s Ghosts into a reflection on the sexual violence in India. Now she finds a paradigm for Hindu nationalism in the man who in 1948 assassinated Gandhi. It’s exhilarating to see such big, bold political history commanding the National Theatre’s largest stage. Nathuram Godse was born in Maharashtra to parents so traumatised by the deaths of three baby sons that they raised him as a girl to propitiate the goddess who might otherwise take him too. This early emasculation, Chandrasekhar suggests, sent him on a quest for identity and purpose that led him first to Gandhi’s unifying movement of peaceful resistance and then to the divisive politics of Vinayak Savarkar, who built the foundations of Hindu nationalism as a prisoner of the British raj. We meet Godse as a child who supports his family by channelling the goddess as a village fortune teller, while earning the respect of his peers with his prowess at spitting. On Rajha Shakiry’s rotating stage, elegantly framed by the strings of a weaving loom, the children romp around in scenes that are interleaved with political debates between a darting-eyed Gandhi (Paul Bazely) and a sleek, grounded Nehru (Marc Elliott). A joke about “that phoney Attenborough film with Sir Ben Kingsley” points to the challenge of squaring up to such well-documented history, but Chandrasekhar does it her way, packing in so much background that at times it seems like an illustrated lecture on the commodities market: first indigo, then cotton and salt. By using a timeframe that darts around, and a focus that zooms in and out from village streets to thousands-strong historic marches, she keeps the drama ticking along. She is brilliantly served by director Indhu Rubasingham, with a staging that conjures multitudes from 19 actors while making clear that revolutionary politics are backroom affairs, conducted by players whose personal foibles will shape the course of history. While Gandhi capers around, almost childlike in his unworldliness, Sagar Arya’s Savarkar is a chilling figure whose lofty contempt calls forth the latent paranoia in his followers. The insidious power of this tactic is demonstrated in close-up scenes at the tailor’s shop where Godse works, turning the goofy young apprentice into an inquisitor, to the horror of his gentle, camp boss, as all the Muslim clients leave. The games of Godse and his childhood friend Vimala (Dinita Gohil) develop into a dialectic of political style and content: she is the open-hearted embodiment of Gandhian peaceful protest, he is a small man trying desperately to control the narrative and swat her out of his story. It needs a powerful actor to hold the centre as Godse, and in Shubham Saraf it gets one. He allows playfulness to billow through his body before resentment starts to corrupt it into a cock-strut of childish vindictiveness and finally into the farcical posturing of a desperado who knows he’s been had, but can’t work out by who, or what to do about it other than to pull the trigger. This isn’t just a chapter in the sad history of the 20th century, but a story of division and whipped-up animosities that has its roots in colonialism and is repeating itself throughout the world today – not least in the UK’s own grubby politics.

5/20/2022,"Amonth ago, I wrote about Better Call Saul’s final stretch. The crux of the piece was that the show has long revelled in telling a story as slowly as possible; how it steadfastly refuses to cut corners by denying us a single element of its overarching narrative. But with so much left to tell, and such a short amount of time to do so, I thought that was all over. This last season was going to be a full-blast rocket ship, I figured, and we would all have to strap in or miss out. Clearly, I was wrong. Rather than rush to its big finale, Better Call Saul’s six most recent episodes have been as methodical as usual, with just about every character meticulously plotting out various unexplained endgames in granular detail. Jimmy and Kim have spent the entire season piecing together an elaborate plot to bring down Howard Hamlin. Lalo Salamanca is roaming the world as part of an impressive big-picture scheme to take revenge on Gus Fring. Fring is busy, too, fortifying himself against the inevitable attack. Lots of pieces are in motion – but Better Call Saul is being exceptionally cagey about where they will end up. But at the end of episode six, things took an ominous turn. Kim Wexler, the breakout character of the entire show and – thanks to her lack of visibility in Breaking Bad – the subject of myriad panicky fan theories, spent the episode being shown a way out. The opportunity of a lifetime came her way, a post that could have underlined her position as a reputable force for good. But something went wrong with her plan to topple Hamlin, and the final shot of the episode was (literally) a drastic U-turn as she went back to fix it. Forget driving away into the sunset. Kim has made her decision to remain in the murk. The episode that is released next week will be a miniature season finale, before the show picks up for its final six episodes in July. There is still a long way to go to connect Better Call Saul with Breaking Bad, and this seems like a logical moment to finally explain why Kim doesn’t make the jump. So what exactly is going to happen to her? Glad you asked, because I have some thoughts. The worst theory is that we’re about to see Kim die. There has been plenty of dark talk of this season being “tragic”, and what could be more tragic than killing off the most beloved character, played by the best actor on television (Rhea Seehorn), long before the final episode? Perhaps something goes awry during their plot to take down Howard. Perhaps Howard, who we recently saw beating up Jimmy, flips and murders her. That would certainly explain why Jimmy goes off the deep end so wildly, in the G-string and Viagra-filled mansion we saw a glimpse of in this season’s first episode. But is that what we want to happen to Kim? Isn’t it a bit expected? And wouldn’t it be tonally jarring for a show that rejects such easy answers? Another theory is that she simply breaks bad. The plot goes off without a hitch and, like almost everyone else who falls into Saul Goodman’s orbit, she simply loses a bit of her soul in the process. There have been a few nods to this – Kim has spent this season so far telling Jimmy who Saul should be – so perhaps she will end up becoming the Evil Emperor of Breaking Bad, guiding Jimmy’s path unseen by all the other characters. Again, though, this feels like a cop out, an instance of the writers keeping a character around because they love her too much to do anything interesting with her. Something the producers said a while ago has stuck with me: what ending does Jimmy deserve? Call me an old-fashioned fool but, after seeing his early good intentions, not to mention his years spent in Cinnabon purgatory, I think he deserves a modicum of happiness. So here’s what I think will happen to Kim. In episode 7, Jimmy and Kim’s plot is going to go majorly wrong and Howard will try to get them arrested. Kim will be the only one who goes to jail, either because she sacrifices herself to save Jimmy, or because Jimmy throws her under the bus. Without her around, Saul’s mask ends up eating Jimmy’s face.

5/20/2022,"Nationwide executives have said they are “highly concerned” about the outlook for inflation, warning that rising costs could harm already struggling customers and drag down house prices. In its annual earnings report, the member-owned building society said it had not yet experienced an increase in defaults on loans or mortgages. However, it warned that surging inflation, which hit a 40-year high of 9% last month, would put “significant pressure” on household budgets, particularly for people on lower incomes who built up less savings during the Covid lockdowns. “Obviously we are highly concerned about the outlook environment,” chief executive Joe Garner told journalists. “And we are very focused on leaning into our members, and really underlining the emphasis of contacting us as early as possible.” He suggested lenders like Nationwide were better equipped to handle the cost of living crisis today, having already helped customers through periods of uncertainty including Brexit and Covid lockdowns. Garner explained that the building society was ready to offer a range of options to struggling customers, including interest-only payment holidays. However, the building society, which is the UK’s second largest mortgage lender behind Lloyd’s Banking Group, explained that higher property prices, rising interest rates, and the “steep increase” in the cost of living meant housing had already become less affordable for consumers. Those financial pressures will also mean people will be more cautious about spending money on new homes, which was likely to impact house prices. “There is a risk of a downward movement in house prices, given the pressure on household budgets”, Nationwide said. “We expect housing market activity to slow and the rate of house price growth to moderate in the coming quarters,” it added. Nationwide’s monthly housing survey showed that the average amount paid for a home in the UK climbed 0.3% to £267,620 in April on a month earlier, though that compared with a 1.1% rise in March. It was also the smallest increase since September last year. It could impact Nationwide’s profit growth, having nearly doubled its annual profits in 2021 when it benefited from stronger economic conditions and a buoyant housing market. Nationwide said on Friday that annual pre-tax profits grew from £823m to £1.6bn. “While the outlook remains challenging, the society continues to demonstrate its resilience,” it said.",News/Business,Nationwide warns of impact of inflation on struggling customers,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/20/nationwide-warns-of-impact-of-inflation-on-struggling-customers
5/20/2022,"Elon Musk has denied claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016, calling the accusations “utterly untrue”. Business Insider reported earlier on Thursday that the billionaire’s SpaceX paid $250,000 (£200,000) in 2018 in a severance settlement following a sexual misconduct claim to an unnamed private jet flight attendant who accused Musk of exposing himself to her. The article quoted an anonymous person who said she was a friend of the flight attendant. The friend had provided a statement as part of the private settlement process, according to the article. “I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me ‘exposed’ – describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so, because it never happened,” Musk tweeted. The Guardian has not been able to verify the Business Insider account. SpaceX has been approached for comment. In addition to allegedly exposing himself, Business Insider quoted the friend of the flight attendant as saying Musk rubbed the flight attendant’s thigh and offered to buy her a horse if she would “do more” during an in-flight massage. The flight attendant came to believe that her refusal to accept Musk‘s proposal had hurt her opportunities to work at SpaceX and prompted her to hire a lawyer in 2018, according to Business Insider. The rocket company made the settlement out of court and included a nondisclosure agreement that prevented the flight attendant from speaking about it, Business Insider said. The news site did not name the friend or the flight attendant. The attendant told her friend that she was asked to go to Musk’s cabin during a flight to London to give a “full body massage”. Upon entering the cabin, she found Musk was “completely naked except for a sheet covering the lower half of his body”. The declaration says that during the massage Musk “exposed his genitals” and “touched her and offered to buy her a horse if she would ‘do more’, referring to the performance of sex acts”. The attendant, a horse rider, declined and continued with the massage without any sexual activity. According to the declaration, in the wake of the incident the attendant felt she was being marginalised in her job. She felt “she was being pushed out and punished for refusing to prostitute herself”, said the declaration. The attendant hired a lawyer in 2018 and sent the allegations to SpaceX’s human resources department. The complaint was resolved after a session with a mediator attended by Musk, according to Business Insider. In November of that year, Musk, SpaceX and the attendant entered into a severance agreement that involved a $250,000 payment in exchange for a pledge not to sue over the claims. Musk, who is also chief executive of Tesla and is in the midst of a contentious effort to buy Twitter, said on Wednesday he would vote Republican instead of Democrat, predicting a “dirty tricks campaign against me” would follow. In the Business Insider article, Musk was quoted as saying the flight attendant’s story was a “politically motivated hit piece” and that there was “a lot more to this story”. He wrote: “If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light.” On Thursday evening, Musk first tweeted: “The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens – this is their standard (despicable) playbook – but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech.” In the initial tweet, he did not specifically mention the allegations in the Business Insider article. “And, for the record, those wild accusations are utterly untrue,” Musk added in another tweet. He also tweeted that the article was meant to interfere with the Twitter acquisition. Musk had agreed to buy Twitter, the social media company with 229 million users, for $44m but has said the deal is “on hold” until he receives further details of the number of fake and spam accounts on the platform.",News/Technology,Elon Musk denies he sexually harassed attendant on private jet in 2016,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/20/elon-musk-denies-he-sexually-harassed-attendant-on-private-jet-in-2016
5/20/2022,"It took being beaten up on London’s Victoria line aged 13, in front of his mum and two sisters, for Jeshi to change tack. “I was sitting on the train, eating McDonald’s; I think we were going to the cinema. I look up and there’s all these guys in front of me. By the time I’d taken my headphones out, they’d punched me.” He chose not to retaliate. “Ego says: go and do something back. But I thought: ‘Who cares? I’m here, I’m alive, there’s no problem.’ I am a rarity in that situation.” This moment, he says, was “this pivot”, away from a life of retaliatory violence and towards his current career as a strikingly singular rapper. Growing up in a deprived part of Walthamstow, east London, he started carrying a knife aged 11, something that “just feels so normal. You never really leave this two-mile radius where everyone is like you, and you find yourself in situations that are quite fucked up. But when you’re in them you’re like: this is just life. You’re born into situations where you have problems with people you don’t even really know, but you want to kill each other.” Now 27, radiating zest in his record label offices, he is well aware of the path he could have gone down; an old schoolfriend was stabbed to death two years ago. “You feel guilt: he could have been me. He wasn’t some drug lord. It’s just as you get older these things get more intense: instead of being punched a couple of times on a train, you’re getting stabbed outside a club. It’s just a natural progression of that stuff, if you don’t remove yourself from it.” Knife crime is one of the social ills Jeshi explores on his superb debut album Universal Credit, but as with its other subjects – such as living amid austerity, or self-worth being eroded by social media – he documents it plainly. “When it feels like someone’s preaching at me, I switch off,” he says. Inspired by Radiohead, Pink Floyd and Amy Winehouse while sounding nothing like any of them, and in its own hook-strewn lane somewhere between UK drill and underground US hip-hop, the album rivals the Streets’ Original Pirate Material or Dizzee Rascal’s Boy in Da Corner for frank, sometimes bleak but often funny framings of UK city life. Jeshi stumbles around in a druggy fog, going clubbing, driving, working and listlessly watching Phillip Schofield and Loose Women, a portrait of the hand-to-mouth existence you live when you’re poor. “Everything’s about today – what’s going to make me look good, or feel good, right now,” he says. A frequent assertion by the comfortably middle class is that the perpetrators of knife violence (or other predominantly working-class crime) should simply choose not to be criminals – easier said than done in an environment where social mobility is close to nil and retributive violence can circle for years. “I love that people are that idealistic,” scoffs Jeshi, putting on a Jacob Rees-Mogg voice: “‘You should just stop doing that and go off to school, young sir.’ And I don’t like it when people say: ‘Well, they need to open youth clubs.’ Open as many as you like: you think all these kids are going to be like: ‘Let’s drop the knives and go and play pool?’” To try to succeed in a music career, for instance, particularly a style of rap that doesn’t sit in the mainstream, “you have to be a bit crazy”, Jeshi says. “The odds of it working out are slim; you have to be naive. I hate whenever anyone says ‘Plan B’ to me – shut the fuck up. I always took it as an insult: why should I not think I can do this?” He talks, tongue half in cheek, about the “superpower of poverty: what it does, sometimes, is that it gives you nothing to lose”. But he is scathing about a UK that leaves behind those who can scarcely risk that kind of fearlessness. “You can work in this country five days a week, in most places, and never hope to get a house. The other thing I hate: if you’re on benefits – ‘How dare you get your nails done?’ Well, maybe it makes them feel good. That £25 getting their nails done brings them some kind of happiness. “The world of the lower class, of knife crime, of drug use: all these are people who have had the humanity ripped away from them. No one cares why they’re doing it, or what makes them feel like that. They just want to hit them with the ‘bad’ sticker: outcast, goodbye, stay over there.” Jeshi’s success – some of his tracks nose into millions of streams – is hard won. He has never met his father, who was deported to Jamaica in his very early youth; he was raised by his mother – after she had a spell in prison – and grandmother, who are hymned on his track Two Mums. “In the community I’m from, [not having a dad] was so normal, it never felt weird. If someone was like: ‘I live with my mum and my dad’, you’d be like: really?” His mum never finished school; when Jeshi did, he didn’t know where to go next. “You don’t know how to manoeuvre your child through that – it’s foreign territory,” he says. “There’s not this thing of: now I’m going to buy my first house. All these things were completely alien concepts.” In the late 00s, Jeshi’s peer group were making the most of free recording technology to create their own grime tracks: “To see it in such a tangible, accessible way it was like: whoa, these are people I’m in science classes with.” As his tastes expanded, he realised he didn’t want to make straightforward music. “When you’re from those kinds of environments, the mind-state is very limited. You do what everyone does, because if you don’t, people are going to look at you and say: that’s weird. I distanced myself from everyone I was around. I wanted to mould my own opinions before I let other people.” Beginning with the Pussy Palace EP in 2016, his atmospheric tracks did touch on topics shared by his peers, with lyrics about getting high and/or horny, and listlessly attempting to manifest material things – Prada glasses, champagne, marble floors. “I was drawing from nothing in particular,” he says. “I got to a point where I wasn’t happy with where things were going for me, and it’s human instinct to blame everyone else: label, manager.” To make Universal Credit, “I snapped out of it: how can I put in more energy, effort, thought?” His previous EP, 2020’s Bad Taste, didn’t set the world alight. “You have these grandiose ideas: I’m going to put this out and I’m going to ride off into the sunset. And it’s very grounding when it doesn’t happen. Everything I’ve ever released has been painful: you’re still in the same jobs you hate, getting fired and having to get a new one, having to borrow money off people.” He went on universal credit while he made his album – the cover shows him receiving a cheque for the benefit’s monthly payout, cut to £324.84 after the Tories removed the temporary Covid uplift – and then worked in a warehouse for £8.50 an hour, “barely any different” in terms of take-home pay. “That cut to universal credit, it wouldn’t have made a difference to the government to have not done that,” he says. “That extra bit wasn’t debilitating the UK economy, and £20 a week means a lot to people. Unfortunately, this is a cold, callous world.” Jeshi says that at 27, he doesn’t remember a time before the Tories’ austerity measures, the unspoken central thesis of which is to lower the threshold of what people find acceptable. “There’s this hopelessness, that this is just what people expect it to be at this stage.” In his lyrics, his solution is frequently to use ecstasy or alcohol to blot this all out, as on the exceptionally good single 3210, which evokes the grey sweat of bad pills. “Sometimes when you don’t have money, you go out, you get pissed, and that [stress] all disappears. You’re tapping that Monzo until the overdraft maxes out: ‘It don’t matter, we’ll fix it tomorrow.’” These snapshots are all part of his central project: “I have a duty to open a window to my world. I don’t want it to feel vague, or,” – he grins righteously – “fucking American.” He admits that he doesn’t have any solutions to inequality; but, while you suspect the Tories would rather citizens and the private sector take responsibility for working them out, nor should he. Instead, his self-portraiture is inspiring in its craft and damning in its truth. “Anything hard that happens in your life shapes who you are,” he says. “You just learn to wear this stuff, and walk through life with it.”  Universal Credit is released 27 May on Because Music",Arts/Music,"‘We’ve had our humanity ripped away’: meet Jeshi, the rapper raging at the cost of living crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/20/jeshi-uk-rapper-universal-credit-interview
5/20/2022,"Six years ago, Mia Hansen-Løve went to a little Baltic island to write a screenplay. On the face of it, a terrible idea. Fårö is not just any island, but the place Ingmar Bergman lived, worked, died and is buried. Like a cinephile Goldilocks, Hansen-Løve slept in a bed in his old house, which may have been haunted. “One night I was alone watching a documentary on Bergman. He was talking about ghosts and sitting in his kitchen. Exactly where I was sitting! I freaked out, and fled to a B&B. I’ve never felt so close to believing in ghosts.” How on earth did she expect to get any work done, haunted by the ghost of a narcissist? “When I think about it rationally it should have been awful,” she says over a video call from Paris. “The burden of Bergman’s heritage! This big male genius!” Bergman was one of those annoying people who find creativity easy: “For him it was a constant flow of ideas.” For Hansen-Løve, now 41, it is the opposite: “I always feel I have the one thing to say but always that it will be the last thing. And I always think this will be the last film I write. All that makes every new writing process tense and somehow painful. I feel very jealous of Bergman” She had a simple premise for her screenplay. Amazingly, in Bergman’s house, she managed to develop it into her new film, a clever, playful postmodern work about sex, relationships, the anxiety of influence, how reality makes art, and vice versa, and how artistic couples help and hinder each other’s creativity. Most of all, though, it is about how making movies is a different business for women than for men like Bergman. It begins with a couple, Tony (Tim Roth) and Chris (Vicky Krieps), both film directors, arriving one summer on Fårö to write their screenplays – just as Hansen-Løve did. Tony is older and more successful, and his screenplay spools out of him seemingly unbidden. Chris struggles, worrying if her sliver of an idea is any good. Bergman Island has been taken by some as a “film-à-clef” about Hansen-Løve’s relationship with the French film director Olivier Assayas, who is 26 years her senior. In 1998, aged 17 and still a lycéenne, she made her screen debut in Assayas’s Late August, Early September. Two years later she appeared in his Sentimental Destinies, by which time they were lovers. After studying dramatic art and writing for Cahiers du Cinéma, Hansen-Løve directed her first film, All Is Forgiven (2007), followed by The Father of My Children (2009). Her recent films have drawn on intimate relationships. In 2011’s Goodbye First Love, the architect, who becomes a young student’s mentor and lover, is modelled on Assayas; in Eden (2015), the DJ is modelled on her brother Sven; and in Things to Come in 2016, Isabelle Huppert plays a character inspired by Mia’s philosopher mother. In Bergman Island, which she wrote the year she and Assayas broke up, the couple’s marriage is unravelling: his emotional chilliness with her contrasts with the intense bondage-sex drawings she discovers in his notebook, while she seems liberated by a flirtation with a gawky film student she meets on the island. She draws a parallel between her couple and the lovers in Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut. “Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman meet again after years of alienation. He says to her: ‘What shall we do now?’ and she says: ‘Let’s fuck!’ The couple are very close, yet very distant. It’s a paradox and yet I understand it very well. Tony and Chris are like that – a couple who are remote, yet intimate. That sort of paradox is very much what my film is about. “But it isn’t autobiographical,” she adds. Not at all? “ I understand why people would say that and, of course, Olivier has certainly inspired some aspects of the character of Tony.” In one scene in the film, Tony tells an admiring audience after a screening that his films always have to have a female lead. A quick look at Assayas’s filmography - Maggie Cheung in Irma Vep, Emmanuelle Béart in Sentimental Destinies, Juliette Binoche in Clouds of Sils Maria or Kristen Stewart in Personal Shopper – suggest that Tony’s creative tastes mirror Olivier’s. But Tony and Olivier are very different, Hansen-Løve insists. “Olivier never set foot on the island, though he is an admirer of Bergman’s work. Maybe he would have been scared to. For me, maybe it’s easier because I’m just like this female director so there no chance that I would compare myself to Bergman.” Certainly there is no oedipal score settling in Hansen-Løve’s film. But there is something more interesting – a meditation on what it means to be as cruel and ruthless in life and art as Bergman, and where it’s necessary to be a narcissist to be truly creative. Early in the film, Chris and Tony have dinner with the leading members of the Ingmar Bergman Foundation , who tell her that the great genius directed more than 60 films and 170 plays, while fathering nine children with six women. “How do you think he could have done that if he was also changing diapers?” asks one of them, rhetorically. The question goes to the heart of Hansen-Løve’s concerns. She has a daughter with Assayas and a son by her current partner, the film-maker Laurent Perreau. “When you are a woman and you make films and you make kids, you have these worries. Does being a mother mean I’m not going to be involved enough in my films? Can I be a director in the way I want to be – passionately, psychically and spiritually engaged? “It’s fucking difficult!” she shouts. It wasn’t for Bergman. He let his partners – including the stars of his films Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson - do the child-rearing, while he made three films a year, many of them deranging studies of female experience. “I haven’t put an ounce of effort into my families,” Bergman once said. And yet, she refuses to be judgmental. “I would probably not have liked to have been one of his women, but then I am very happy he made 60 films that I can watch and enjoy.” She says she takes succour from the fact that one of his sons, Ingmar Bergman Jr, has revived his father’s film production company. “He seems to be at total peace with who his father was. I find that quite beautiful. We can forgive even bad fathers.” Nor is she critical about the transformation of Fårö, since Bergman’s death in 2007, into a secular shrine. Today, you can go on a “big Bergman safari” bus tour of his film locales. There are conferences about his films and retreats for artists just as he wished. Screenings take place at his home cinema, though visitors are warned not to sit in the great man’s seat. When I giggle over this, Hansen-Løve demurs. “This kind of sacralisation of the cinema and of the director is something that I don’t want to spit on. I think it’s important for the kind of film-lovers that I belong to. It’s part of the beauty of the relationship to this art.” Happpily, Mia Hansen-Løve was not crushed by the great man’s burden while she worked on Fårö. Instead, she was creatively catalysed to write with unprecedented freedom. “I can’t explain really, but I never felt so much lightness and peacefulness and I would even say playfulness.” That beguiling playfulness comes out clearly in how the film blurs fiction and reality. When Chris describes her scenario to Tony, her idea comes to life before us as a film within the film we’re watching. It’s the story of a woman called Amy (Mia Wasikowska), who rekindles an affair with an old flame, Joseph (Anders Danielsen Lie), when they both attend a friend’s wedding on Fårö. Then, Hansen Love’s film gets even more imaginatively playful. We see Chris shooting the film she described to Tony. Wasikowska and Lie appear as themselves, and Chris flirts with Lie. It’s more than a Brechtian demolition of the fourth wall. “It is a very complex conceit, but there is nothing intellectual about how I wrote it. It was something mystical, like a vision.” Her latest film, One Fine Morning, which premieres at Cannes this month, was made in lockdown and stars Léa Seydoux as a single mother. Once more, it draws on the director’s own life and explores another emotional paradox. “It’s the portrait of a woman whose father is dying, and she’s overcome with grief and yet she is also falling in love at the same time. It’s about those two impossible emotions existing together. Impossibility,” she laughs, “is what I want to show in cinema.”  Bergman Island is in UK cinemas from 3 June.
