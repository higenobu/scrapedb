2/1/2022,"After arriving in A&E in December 2020, June Roche’s husband, Jake, sat alone and in pain for nine hours before being transferred to a cardiology ward after suffering a heart attack. He died 36 hours later, aged 48. Jake died at a time when there were at least 4,000 extra deaths in hospitals in England during the first year of the pandemic, according to new research, due to inadequate care brought on by the strain on health services.  “I know they can’t save everybody and I know that he may have died anyway. But I just feel that on that Friday night, he did not need to sit there for nine hours, they needed to make him comfortable,” Roche said. “But it wasn’t the doctors making him sit there. It was the system. They were overwhelmed. They couldn’t do anything. They couldn’t get around to people.” She added that there was only one doctor on shift that evening, and that “nobody on the ground in that place could have done anything different”, but she often looks back and wonders whether she could have “kicked up a fuss” to try to get him seen more quickly. “They all say with a heart attack the first hour is the most important,” she said. “You just assume that if someone is having a heart attack, they’ll rush them through, they’ll work on them and make them comfortable but nothing was happening. “My husband was there huddled up in his coat, they had the doors open for ventilation because of coronavirus and it was freezing cold,” she said, adding that she wished she could have livestreamed the situation to the public to show the importance of taking Covid precautions to ease pressure on the health service. A year on – and despite mass vaccinations reducing Covid hospital admissions – staff absences and a shortage of workers mean that many services are still struggling. Colin*, 63, lay in an ambulance outside A&E for 10 hours before he was admitted to hospital in November last year. Once there, he lay on a bed in a corridor, undiagnosed, for three days suffering from septicaemia. “They were that backed up they had to just leave me. To be honest, I was that gone I just didn’t care,” he said. “Because I was there instead of on a ward, I couldn’t get the attention of a nurse so I peed myself and that’s very degrading, really. “It’s not their fault, but it’s not a one-off. If you haven’t got the staff and the infrastructure because you keep cutting it then what do you expect?” A report in November found patients were dying in the back of ambulances and up to 160,000 more people a year were coming to harm due to being stuck outside hospitals unable to be offloaded to A&E. “The paramedics said they’re quite used to having seven to 10 ambulances stacked back outside. I asked the bloke what happens if you have a heart attack while waiting and he said, ‘Well, you just die.’ They just sit there, totally unable to go out on other calls,” he said. Akshay Patel said he and his family had lost faith in the system after his mother, Bina, 56, died waiting nearly an hour for an ambulance to arrive in October while she suffered a heart attack and stroke. He made six 999 calls during that time while his mother shouted in pain. “I kept looking out the window for the blue lights but they never came. My mum was screaming for help, and kept asking ‘Where are they?’,” he said. He said he was frustrated that it was only on his second call that the call handler mentioned there could be a long wait. “They never told me there was going to be a delay and to make my own way there. If they had told me that on the initial call, potentially I could have done that,” he said. “By the time they told me, I couldn’t move her. On the final call I said she was gone, she was dead.” More than 40,000 people in England who called 999 with a “category 2” condition, such as a stroke or a heart attack, waited more than an hour and 40 minutes for an ambulance in November, data showed, significantly higher than the NHS target to reach them within 18 minutes. Heart attack patients calling 999 in parts of northern England have also been asked to get a lift instead of waiting for an ambulance. “It’s not an isolated case, it’s happening up and down the country. After this happened, I got private health [insurance] straight away. The system, in my eyes, it’s broken,” Patel said. “From a young age we all get told, any kind of emergency, ring this number and someone will be there for you. And it just didn’t happen in my case.” Sue Atkins said her family also had developed doubts about the effectiveness of the NHS after 27-year-old son, Norman Barker, collapsed and died outside A&E after being told there was a four-hour wait to be seen in September 2021. She had driven Norman, also known by his friends as James Salvator, to hospital after he was told it was a two-hour wait for an ambulance. “I can’t say anything bad about the resus [resuscitation] team, they worked really hard to try and get his heart beating again. But I feel like the NHS wasn’t there when I needed it for my son,” she said. “We’re still sore, we’re still feeling angry. Maybe they could have saved him, maybe not, but we will never know that do we?” Throughout the pandemic the government has stressed the importance of protecting the NHS, and although he said parts of the service might become overwhelmed in January, Boris Johnson insisted that the system was strong enough to “ride out” the latest Covid wave. But for families with experience of trying to get care on the NHS frontline, the situation already feels critical. “The conclusion I’ve come to is that this is what overwhelmed looks like,” said Roche. “I don’t know what I thought it would look like, maybe I thought that it would all just blow up or every department would fall down at once. But it’s not that, it’s single departments falling down at different times and they struggle back up. This is what it is, this is the problem.” *Some names have been changed to preserve anonymity",News/Society,‘They were overwhelmed’: Families tell of deaths waiting for NHS urgent care,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/01/overwhelmed-families-deaths-waiting-urgent-care-pandemic
2/1/2022,"Almost 1,500 jobs are at risk at Tesco as the supermarket ditches night shifts in more than 80 stores and almost 40 petrol stations. The potential job cuts emerged only a day after the UK’s biggest supermarket chain said it would be shutting its Jack’s discount chain, with the potential loss of about 130 jobs, and closing more of its deli and meat counters.  Overnight stock replenishment will now be done during the day in 36 large stores and 49 convenience stores. At 36 stores, petrol stations will be converted to be “pay-at-pump only” overnight. Jason Tarry, chief executive of Tesco’s UK and Irish business, said: “We operate in a highly competitive and fast-paced market and our customers are shopping differently, especially since the start of the pandemic. “We are always looking at how we can run our business as simply and efficiently as possible, so that we can re-invest in the things that matter most to customers. The changes we are announcing today will help us do this.” The retailer said it had 3,000 vacancies in the business and aimed to work with each affected member of staff to try to help them find another role. Daniel Adams, national officer of shop workers union Usdaw, said the union was engaging with the supermarket in an effort to protect jobs and secure the best deal for those affected. Adams said: “Tesco has informed us that they are looking to undertake a number of restructures across the business … Clearly this will be incredibly unsettling for those who may be affected. “We should not forget the role that key workers have played throughout the coronavirus pandemic and to receive this news is devastating. Tesco has nearly 3,000 stores in the UK in total, including 800 large supermarkets, and it is not clear if it will adjust night shifts in further stores in future.",News/Business,"Tesco ditches night shifts putting 1,500 jobs at risk",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/tesco-ditches-night-shifts-putting-1500-jobs-at-risk
2/1/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine will be responsible for its own destruction if it undermines existing peace agreements, a senior Russian diplomat has warned at a combative UN security council debate on the crisis.  The warning from Vasily Nebenzya, Russia’s permanent representative to the UN, came on a day of continued high-level diplomacy aimed at defusing the Ukraine crisis. The state department said it had received a response from the Kremlin to a document the US delivered in Moscow last week, formally outlining areas where the Biden administration believes the two countries could find common ground. US officials would not disclose the contents of the Russian letter, saying they would not “negotiate in public”. Russia’s state news agency RIA reported that Russia had sent follow-up questions rather than a response, and that Moscow was still working on a response. What did Nebenzya say about Ukraine? “If our western partners push Kyiv to sabotage the Minsk agreements, something that Ukraine is ... willingly doing, then that might end in the absolute worst way for Ukraine. And not because somebody has destroyed it, but because it would have destroyed itself and Russia has absolutely nothing to do with this.” What happens next? The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, are due to talk on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, may meet in person soon. Boris Johnson has been challenged by a Conservative backbencher to commit to publishing the full report on Downing Street parties, as his deputy, Dominic Raab, said it was “unclear” if there was further evidence to come. Mark Harper, a former Conservative chief whip, told the Guardian he had asked Johnson to reiterate at Wednesday’s prime minister’s questions his promise – made in private to MPs – to publish the full report. A party in Boris and Carrie Johnson’s flat is one of 12 events being investigated by the Metropolitan police over alleged lockdown breaches, it has emerged, as the Sue Gray report into breaches of lockdown rules found “failures of leadership and judgment” in No 10. Gray, a senior civil servant, criticised the culture in Johnson’s Downing Street that allowed social gatherings to take place during lockdown, which were “difficult to justify”. The findings were released on the government’s website in a shortened and redacted form, after the Met last week said it was investigating some of the gatherings. In a dramatic moment in the Commons where the report was being discussed, Johnson was challenged by Theresa May, his predecessor as prime minister, who said either he “had not read the rules, didn’t understand the rules or didn’t think they applied to No 10”. The police have obtained more than 300 photographs and 500 pages of documents in their investigation. The images include pictures taken at alleged parties and from security-system cameras. The US talkshow host and actor Whoopi Goldberg has offered her “sincerest apologies” after saying the Holocaust “isn’t about race”. She said Jewish people around the world had “always had my support”, in a statement after her remarks led to a backlash online. Goldberg, who co-hosts The View on ABC, said the atrocity was about “man’s inhumanity to man”. She made the comments on the show during a discussion about a Tennessee school board’s decision to ban the Pulitzer prize-winning Holocaust graphic novel Maus. In a statement posted on Twitter, Goldberg said: “On today’s show I said the Holocaust ‘is not about race, but about man’s inhumanity to man’. I should have said it is about both. As Jonathan Greenblatt from of the Anti-Defamation League shared, ‘The Holocaust was about the Nazi’s systematic annihilation of the Jewish people, who they deemed to be an inferior race’. I stand corrected.” What did she say on the show? She said: “Let’s be truthful, the Holocaust isn’t about race, it’s not. It’s about man’s inhumanity to man, that’s what it’s about. These are two groups of white people.” The Azimuth music festival in Saudi Arabia, a government-backed event that cost $20m, was secretly organised by the youth media company Vice, as part of the organisation’s push to make money in the Middle Eastern state despite its poor human rights record, it has emerged. A video of a woman apparently locked against her will in a filthy shack has gone viral in China, prompting an investigation as well as a conversation about the country’s treatment of people with mental illness. Standing in freezing conditions, the woman appeared to be chained by her neck to a concrete wall. The New York Times has acquired the viral word game Wordle for an undisclosed seven-figure sum, the publisher announced. The newspaper promised Wordle would remain free to play for new and existing players and no changes would be made to its gameplay. The threat to the west from the Chinese government is “more brazen, more damaging” than ever, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, has said, accusing Beijing of stealing American ideas and innovation and launching massive hacking operations. This weekend, the Mattel Films executive vice-president, Robbie Brenner, gave an interview to Variety, during which she laid out her ambitious plans for cinematic domination. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling have signed on to star in a Barbie movie directed by Greta Gerwig, working from a script she co-wrote with Noah Baumbach.

2/1/2022,"Joe Rogan isn’t a far-right ideologue, pushing a consistent political agenda. Rather, he is a grifter, who hides behind excuses like curiosity, entertainment, freedom and neutrality to push whatever controversy that sells. Now, that controversy is hurting Spotify’s bottom line, which is why they have pushed him to publicly apologize and pledge to “try harder”.  Obviously, that will not end the disinformation on his show, on Spotify, or on the many other platforms (like YouTube). Joe Rogan is not the problem, he is the symptom. The symptom of a society in which pandering to a mostly rightwing, but certainly anti-left, minority can be highly profitable. Just like the current Republican party, they live off liberal outrage rather than any consistent political message. This is not to minimize the problem. In fact, this problem is much larger than a disinformation-spreading grifter with millions of listeners. The real problem is not the supply of disinformation but the demand for it. As long as there is a mass demand, you can neither ban nor boycott your way out of disinformation. This is not to say that the boycott of Neil Young and other artists wasn’t useful – it was. It shifted the cost-benefit analysis of the controversy and pushes grifters like Rogan and their promoters like Spotify away from the most egregious disinformation. But it does not weaken the breeding ground. For this, a much more challenging approach is needed, which accepts Rogan and Spotify for what they ultimately are, nihilist capitalists driven by greed, and focuses primarily on their potential audiences instead. Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the school of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia I admire the musicians who have withdrawn their music from Spotify in protest over the spread of Covid misinformation on Joe Rogan’s podcast. But I myself believe that free speech is indivisible. Rogan should stay on Spotify, though with his $100m salary sensibly brought in line with that of, let’s say, an NPR intern. Spotify shouldn’t silence Rogan. First he goes, then someone else’s podcast seems … sketchy, and there’s that slippery slope. So here’s how it might be handled. Before Rogan’s podcast, there should be an announcement, not by Rogan himself, but by the painfully loud, electronic bear-horn voice that interrupts our regular broadcasts with hurricane warnings and Amber alerts. The electronic voice should say: “What you are about to hear about Covid and the vaccine is total and absolute bullshit. If you believe these lies and act on them, you are gambling with your life and the lives of all the people you love.” This warning should be repeated, word for word, every five minutes during the Rogan podcast. If Joe Rogan objects, he can leave Spotify and take his show elsewhere. But if he agrees to remain, the solution (and the publicity it generates) would turn the Rogan podcast from a bad thing into a good one and maybe save a few lives. Francine Prose is the author, most recently, of The Vixen. She was also the president of PEN America Yes, people are trying to censor Joe Rogan. I know many in liberal circles would counter that only the state can censor, therefore attempting to get Spotify to “deplatform” America’s most polarizing podcaster can’t be anything of the sort. “Don’t you know that Rogan is a millionaire with many ways to reach his legions of supporters with his scientifically dubious views and guests?” they say.We’ve seen enough examples throughout history of censorship not involving the state. Think about the protests of Universal Studio after The Last Temptation of Christ in 1988, or the more dramatic book burnings and boycotts of the 20th century. The question, then, is whether censorship is ever justified. I think it can be. Actions undertaken by Lincoln’s government to censor the press and mail were part of winning a civil war that ended with republican liberty expanded, not destroyed. Actions taken by leftwing groups to deny Nazis platform in the media or in academia can sometimes work too (at other times, it might be better to deny the attention that being censored often affords the censored). But is anyone seriously arguing that the stakes of the Rogan affair rises to this level? Or that pushing Rogan off Spotify will slow down the spread of vaccine skepticism and make a material difference in the wellbeing of ordinary Americans? What’s indisputable is that the debate contributes to the further cementing of American politics as a spectacle of culture war without the possibility of shared, mass politics around common issues. Time spent demanding that Spotify do something about Joe Rogan is time we’re not spending demanding the US state guarantee things like universal healthcare. And that’s the surest route I know to defeat not only vaccine hesitancy, but the broader conspiratorial drift of US politics. Bhaskar Sunkara is the founding editor of Jacobin magazine and a Guardian US columnist. He is the author of The Socialist Manifesto: The Case for Radical Politics in an Era of Extreme Inequality In a pandemic, misinformation’s pernicious effect is to offer false hope to the anxious; to dissuade people from following guidance from public health professionals; and to make people hesitate before taking a vaccine that has saved millions of lives worldwide.Right now, as you read this, there are people gasping for breath in ICUs because they heard misinformation online or heard it in a podcast like Rogan’s, broadcast to millions.If I ran Spotify, I’d be worried. Sure, legally, thanks to quirks in US law (a 25-year-old provision called section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 1996) they cannot be held liable for the content they host. But what about the rest of us? Can we hold them liable for the fact they continue to happily profit from his show? Worse still, that they paid him a ton of money so that he would bring his enormous audience to their company. Can other artists? Listeners? Shareholders? Activists? Well, yes we can, we should, and we have.This story is a synecdoche of big tech’s arrogance, indifference and greed over the past decade. They are the custodians of the most powerful communication technology in history. But their business model is a short-termist grab for cash that, ironically, destroys their long-term brand value. We should do everything we can in society to force reform. And Congress should repeal section 230, so people can sue if companies have not acted reasonably in their duty of care to users harmed by big tech’s failure. Imran Ahmed is Chief Executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate American institutions and media have long ago lost the public trust. Post-pandemic, state level incompetence and partisan opacity have driven vast numbers of people out onto the web in search of alternative narratives. Joe Rogan is a popular source of news and editorial opinion because, contrasted against an increasingly illegitimate mainstream, he appears as a curious and honest narrator in search of a hidden truth. The last few years have seen a narrowing of political speech online. In some cases, such as post-vaccine immunity or the lab leak hypothesis, this has been to the detriment of the public discourse. Expert opinions may now be overturned. Why was this questioning not allowed before? The slow enclosure of online political speech is being offered as a Band-Aid solution for the much more difficult but necessary task of earning the public’s faith in their state and media. Until we are able to address the problem further upstream, it seems to me that we are watching the slow erosion of liberal freedoms without anything being offered in return.

2/1/2022,"On 1 February 2021, Myanmar’s military seized power in a coup in the dead of night, hours before the newly elected parliament was due to convene for the first time. The military alleged voter fraud in the November 2020 election, when its proxy party was trounced by the National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, which won a landslide re-election victory. A few days after the coup, mass protests erupted in Yangon and across the country. While there were some isolated incidents of violence, security forces largely allowed peaceful demonstrations to take place throughout the month of February. But towards the end of the month, the junta deployed increasingly violent tactics, from water cannon, beatings and rubber bullets to live ammunition.  On 28 February, at least 18 people were killed in clashes across the country; from there the violence escalated. The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a rights monitoring group, has documented more than 1,400 civilians deaths during military crackdowns on the pro-democracy movement. As of 10 January, 103 of those killed by the military were women. In total, 239 people have died in military custody, of whom 91 were tortured to death during interrogation, according to the AAPP. More than 11,000 people have been arrested, of whom more than 8,700 remain in detention. Despite these brutal tactics, even after a year, the military has been unable to quell the resistance and is struggling to contain uprisings across multiple fronts. In February 2021, Myanmar's progress towards democracy was brutally stalled when the military seized power and took control of the country.   In the year since, the country has been plunged into violence, poverty and mass displacement as the military attempts to crush widespread resistance to its rule.  Internet blackouts, arbitrary arrests, a ruthless curtailing of freedom of speech and escalating military attacks on civilian areas have silenced the voices of people from Myanmar.   For this special series, the Guardian’s Rights and freedom project has partnered with a diverse group of journalists from Myanmar, many working in secret, to bring their reporting on life under military rule to a global audience. Journalists in Myanmar are working in dangerous and difficult circumstances, as the military government attacks the free press and shuts down local media outlets. Many reporters still inside the country fear arrest, with others forced to leave their homes and go into hiding in areas increasingly under attack from military forces.  All the reporting in this series will be carried out by journalists from Myanmar, with support from the editors on the Rights and freedom project. These are the stories that journalists from Myanmar want to tell about what is happening to their country at this critical moment. The violent crackdowns have inevitably sparked armed resistance, with civilians forming militias mostly in rural areas, and often allying with major ethnic armed groups, which have fought for greater political rights for decades. The military have responded with typical brutality, allegedly targeting entire civilian populations in an attempt to snuff out resistance, displacing hundreds of thousands. Tactics including airstrikes, shelling, arson and mass arrests and killings have caused hundreds of thousands to flee their homes, most of whom are sheltering in the forest or in makeshift displacement camps where the military is also blocking their access to essential food and medical care, rights groups have found. A further 19,000 people have crossed into neighbouring countries since the coup. Those newly displaced since February add to 340,000 people who were already living in protracted displacement situations before the coup, including more than 100,000 Rohingya people in Rakhine State. As part of its broader attacks on civilian populations, the military has burned homes and buildings, including churches. In the town of Thantlang in Chin state, it has launched 18 arson attacks since September, which have destroyed more than 900 homes and displaced all of the town’s 10,000 residents, according to the Chin Human Rights Organisation. As of 27 December the United Nations had identified more than 2,200 houses and civilian properties burned or destroyed since the coup. Coming on top of the Covid-19 pandemic, the military coup has had devastating effects on incomes and has caused a climb in food insecurity across Myanmar. A survey conducted by the UN Development Programme in May and June 2021 predicted that urban poverty would triple by early 2022 compared with 2019 levels. The UN has identified 14.4 million people across Myanmar in need of humanitarian assistance in 2022, according to its Myanmar Humanitarian Needs Overview, which described an “unprecedented political, socioeconomic, human rights and humanitarian crisis” as a result of the coup and Covid-19. Factors including increasing armed conflict and displacement, as well as deteriorating access to essential public services, have deepened pre-existing needs among already vulnerable groups, including Rohingya people and other populations living in protracted displacement. Under military rule, an economy already racked by Covid-19 has further cratered. Hundreds of thousands of civil servants refused to work for the military regime, crippling the public sector, while many others have refused to cooperate with public services, for example by no longer paying electricity bills. In rural areas, military attacks have displaced farmers from their land, leaving hundreds of thousands struggling to plant or harvest their crops. A World Food Programme report covering August to November 2021 identified Myanmar as a “hunger hotspot” and warned of an increase in acute food insecurity; media reports indicate that hunger is already increasing. The UN found prices for key household commodities have risen significantly in some parts of the country, while farming incomes have been negatively affected by factors including lower wholesale prices for some crops, higher input prices and limited access to credit. Further violence and financial hardship look inevitable for people across Myanmar as the junta struggles to maintain its grip on power.",News/Global development,Myanmar’s coup: a year under military rule in numbers,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/01/myanmar-coup-a-year-under-military-rule-in-numbers
2/1/2022,"A few months ago, I decided I wanted to drive the entirety of Highway 12 – a slim highway that snakes along North Carolina’s barrier islands – before the climate crisis alters it further. Though I spent much of my childhood on the southern part of North Carolina’s coast, these overdeveloped, humid islands have piqued my imagination for decades. I wanted to witness what remains, and what is likely to disappear.  You can see the precarity of those islands (also known as the Outer Banks) on a map. The nearly 200-mile stretch of barrier islands runs the length of most of North Carolina’s coastline. Around here, change is non-negotiable: the highway lies atop a series of barrier islands – dynamic mounds of sand designed by nature to shift. Plus, the Outer Banks are the most regular hurricane target north of Florida. I knew I had to brace myself for the fact that the islands would no longer resemble what I knew as a child: roadside produce stands, small miniature golf courses, the occasional surf shop. Those flecks of Americana are still there, but the holiday homes are larger and more numerous; the restaurants and surf shops are grander and more corporate; the churning sea has carved up the coastline a little more. I stopped by my sister’s house in Wilmington, North Carolina, in early November, where I planned to start my trip up Highway 12. Northern Buxton, Hatteras Village and Northern Rodanthe had just reported ocean overwash from a nor’easter, and the road was closed. North Carolina’s Highway 12 runs 148 miles, a system of two-lane highways, ferries and bridges connecting islands and peninsulas. It’s a lifeline for the nearly 20 communities, 57,000 residents, small businesses and tourists – but high tides and storms gnaw constantly at the road. Dr Stanley Riggs, a geologist who runs an organization devoted to sustainable practices along North Carolina’s coast, tells me there are “numerous portions of this highway with serious problems that require severe ongoing maintenance. Some segments require total rebuilding multiple times a year. The yellow bulldozers work all year long now. “Before the major economic development boom of the 20th century,” Riggs said, “these islands were allowed to respond naturally to storm dynamics … The barriers are both the ocean’s speed bumps and the land’s safety valves, and must be able to move in response to the storms’ energy.” However, the fixed structures of ocean front development and Highway 12 now lock the barrier islands in place. Nature’s strength and will is undeniable, despite human intentions. In recent years, Hurricanes Irene and Isabel carved Hatteras Island in half, causing locals to use emergency ferries for weeks until the highway was restored. In September 2019, Hurricane Dorian destroyed 1,000ft of Highway 12 in Ocracoke. The road reopened months later, in early December. “We must learn to live with storm dynamics,” Riggs says. “The beach will move, villages will flood, and storm surges will open new inlets to let storm surge water both into and out of the estuaries.” However, the government has allowed further development and built higher dune dykes to protect the highway and homes, which essentially traps storm surge during weather events, making flooding much worse over time. “Before World War II,” Riggs explains, “all the old villages were built on the backside of the islands. Now the oceanfront is totally built out and has locked the system into a guaranteed natural disaster zone.” Development and climate change are straining the islands. Up until the 1990s, about 15 miles of North Carolina’s ocean beaches required re-nourishment sand on an irregular basis in order to have what Riggs calls “a wide and healthy beach for a successful economic year”. Now he says there are over a 100 miles of beaches that need re-nourishment every couple of years, at the cost of $3m to $6m a mile. Static landscapes remind us of who we were; shifting landscapes remind us that we have changed, or perhaps that we have not cared for what matters to us enough. The day before my trip, the North Carolina department of transportation indicated that Highway 12 would reopen earlier than expected, but drivers would need to beware of standing salt water and evening high tides. I set out the next morning at 6am, knowing I had at least a 10-hour driving day ahead of me, and two ferries to catch. First I drove to Beaufort, a small town located on an inlet, where I spent much of my childhood summers. Once quiet and historic, the town is now beloved by developers for its charm and association with the pirate Blackbeard. I drove through the heart of town and past the docks, where I first fell in love with maritime culture. Then, I turned toward Cedar Island to catch the ferry to Ocracoke. The closer I got to the ferry terminal, the more development slowed. I drove past a monument to a seafood processing family, a solitary shrimp boat, houses haphazardly raised on stilts – some looking like a Hail Mary DIY-job. Signs advertising church services rose from the salt marsh. I drove my car on to the hulking ferry, cormorants shooting low over the water next to the boat. A ferry employee asked me what I was doing. I shared that I was an environmental journalist. He pulled me inside the ferry to show me a picture of an island that had disappeared under the rising seas. “I believe in climate change,” he told me, quietly, as if he was afraid someone might overhear him. “But I’m an ugly American. I don’t like to be told what to do. Ask me nicely to wear a mask or recycle. Then I’ll do just about anything for you.” His tone reminded me of the fraught political moment. The Outer Banks locals vote conservatively, and often view environmental policy as liberal overreach. The boat docked slowly at Ocracoke. The town’s recent population hovers near 700, declining roughly 25% in the last decade – though nearly 10,000 tourists inhabit the island during the peak summer season. The Hatterask Indians, known as Croatoan people, once hunted and fished here prior to colonial intrusion. Blackbeard favored the treacherous shoals and was killed near the island in 1718. Now island pastimes include sport fishing and kiteboarding. I stopped at one of the only open restaurants for lunch. Country music blared from a speaker. No one was wearing a mask. I decided to eat a granola bar instead and drove Highway 12 through bits of maritime forest – salt-pruned oaks and low cedars – and high dunes. I pulled over and walked out onto the mostly deserted beach. A few people fished from the open beds of pickup trucks. Sand blew across the road as I moved toward my final ferry, from Ocracoke to Hatteras. A long line formed to board; I was 20 cars back from the cutoff. Those of us in line accepted our fate, turned off our cars, stretched on the road and socialized. Time slowed; I watched an old dachshund stick its head out of the moonroof in the car in front of me. I made the next ferry – the W Stanford White. My car shook as it pulled away from the dock. A faint moon hung over the sea and a spit of land covered in pelicans and cormorants. The sun was beginning to set as I drove slowly through Hatteras. Standing water pooled in front of new construction. At some points, I could see water on either side of the road. I stopped for gas and dinner at a bait shop. “A lot of places are closed,” I said as I paid for a beer. “The workers need rest,” the woman said. She looked tired. I sensed it had been a long year for her, too. As the sun went down I came to the part of Highway 12 I most wanted to see. My headlights illuminated bright yellow signs that warned of “high water”. Moonlight fell upon the bulldozers parked in the dunes. The strip of highway that moves through Rodanthe felt impossibly slim, as if the black water on either side of the road might close in. High tide was coming, and pools of water on the road sprayed upward with oncoming traffic. I could see the dark shape of the new bridge being built alongside the road. In 2017, after a decade of costly work on the so-called S-Curve section of the highway in Rodanthe – including a $3m emergency repair after Irene, and a $20m beach nourishment project in 2012 - North Carolina’s department of transportation commissioned a $145m project to raise 2.4 miles of Highway 12. Certain portions of the oceanfront along the S-Curve were losing 11-12ft a year, and forecasts predicted similar scenarios along the corridor. As with many projects in environmentally and culturally sensitive areas, legal action followed. A group of private landowners contested the Bonner Bridge, saying it was rushed to appease environmentalists, who wanted to protect sensitive nesting areas for birds. The Trump administration called it an example of “excessive environmental planning”. Conservation groups, led by the Southern Environmental Law Center, sued to ensure the bridge project moved forward in a climate and wildlife-smart way, ultimately returning 19 acres to the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge, a critical area for migrating and threatened birds like the American Oystercatcher and Least Tern. The bridge is opening this fall, ahead of schedule. I drove through Nags Head and turned into town, marveling at the golden sunset and the wild, artificial glow of a Wings Surf Shop. In the Outer Banks, the natural coexists with the artificial, like the grace of a heron as it flies over a miniature golf course. Still, I appreciated the off-season quiet of the drive, locals wishing each other happy birthday on business signs, retired couples making a slow visit to a small post office. Beneath every tourist economy is a town’s old self – what’s left of its traditions and elders, its hospitality workers, the people who are left to pick up the pieces after a hurricane, or care for each other in the winter of a pandemic. As I pulled into my lodging for the night, a tiny cottage underneath a live oak on the outskirts of Kitty Hawk, I thought about the layers of change and loss on islands like these, especially in a time of compound disasters, where both a pandemic and a changing climate press down on small communities. “An economic-system based on unlimited development on mobile piles of sand doesn’t have a very bright future as we know it,” Riggs tells me. “At the present rate of change, North Carolina’s coastal system is looking at a possible one meter rise in sea level by 2100.” This increase is already well underway. “We’ve built ourselves into a situation we can’t engineer our way out of,” he says with a sadness in his voice. When I was younger, I played a part in a play about the Lost Colony, the doomed English settlement on Roanoke Island (every kid who grew up in eastern North Carolina probably did.) At the time, we marveled at how an entire village could just disappear. These days, I am beginning to understand. The Outer Banks have seen waves of Indigenous inhabitants, violent colonization, fishing villages, tourism and intense development – all a struggle for power and resources in a mercurial natural environment.",News/US news,North Carolina’s coastal highway is disappearing – so I took a road trip,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/01/north-carolina-highway-climate-crisis-road-trip
2/1/2022,"Boris Johnson’s efforts to present himself as a key diplomatic player in the Ukraine crisis have been struck a blow after the Kremlin refused to reschedule a call with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, that the prime minister had been forced to cancel on Monday. The call was cancelled so Johnson could make a statement to MPs in parliament over Downing Street parties during lockdown.  No 10 had said it intended the call, previously set for Monday afternoon, to go ahead on Tuesday but the Kremlin rejected the request. It is not clear if the call has been delayed due to genuine scheduling issues or is a calculated snub by Moscow to highlight Britain’s irrelevance, and Johnson’s weakness. The Kremlin said a call could take place at a future date. Instead of speaking with Putin on Monday, Johnson had to spend two hours answering MPs. questions over his role in a succession of Downing Street gatherings held during lockdown, The news came as the prime minister flew to Kyiv on Tuesday offering the Ukraine government £88m to fight corruption, part of a British show of solidarity with the country in its threatened confrontation with Russia. Johnson will be hoping the brief visit takes attention away from his domestic political travails over sanctioning Downing Street parties during lockdown. The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, had been due to accompany Johnson to Ukraine, but was forced to cancel after she tested positive for Covid. Truss appeared unwell as she delivered a Commons statement promising Russian oligarchs would have nowhere to escape UK sanctions if they invaded Ukraine. Britain is seen as one of the staunchest supporters of Ukrainian sovereignty, providing military aid, and its stance has been compared favourably by some Ukrainian politicians with that of Germany, where a debate still rages about whether the government in Berlin can help militarily if at all. Since 2015, British armed forces have trained more than 22,000 Ukrainian troops to defend themselves, as well as providing soft loans for the country to strengthen its navy. The Ukrainian army is already training with new anti-tank missiles provided by the UK. Johnson is one of many European politicians pouring into Kyiv this week, including the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and numerous foreign ministers. The £88m of new funding to combat corruption is taken from the UK’s good governancefund. The US Treasury is waging a relentless campaign of sanctions and forfeiture against Ukrainian oligarchs, including Igor Kolomoisky, who has been accused of embezzling state funds. The money is also intended to help Ukraine diversify away from its reliance on Russian gas, seen as one of the structural weaknesses in the geopolitical struggle with Moscow. Johnson will need to strike a delicate balance between highlighting the massing of Russian troops at the border and welcoming the continued diplomacy under way between the US and Russia. President Volodymr Zelenskiy has urged Europe not to be hysterical about the Russian threat fearing a sense of panic could drive the delicate Ukrainian economy into a tailspin. In advance of his visit, Johnson said: “It is the right of every Ukrainian to determine how they are governed. As a friend and a democratic partner, the UK will continue to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty in the face of those who seek to destroy it. “We urge Russia to step back and engage in dialogue to find a diplomatic resolution and avoid further bloodshed.” The UK defence secretary, Ben Wallace, is in discussions with Nato about what further British military support can be offered to support the bloc’s eastern flank. He visited Hungary on Monday, one of the countries in the European Union closest to Putin. Its prime minister, Viktor Orbán, was due to meet the Russian president on Tuesday and Hungary has so far ruled out the deployment of more Nato troops inside its country and appeared lukewarm about imposing further sanctions on Russia.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson rebuffed in bid to play key role in Ukraine diplomacy,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/01/boris-johnson-rebuffed-in-bid-to-play-key-role-in-ukraine-diplomacy

2/1/2022,"Streets were deserted and shops abandoned across many of Myanmar’s towns and cities on Monday, as the public defied threats by the military junta and stayed at home in a “silent strike” on the first anniversary of the country’s coup. Images posted on social media showed usually congested roads with no traffic and stores shuttered. In a photograph shared by Khit Thit Media, the usually busy Sule Pagoda road in downtown Yangon was completely empty. In Mandalay, the second largest city, a normally bustling market had virtually no customers.  Images posted online showed similar scenes across the country: from Myitkyina and Namati in Kachin, Myanmar’s northernmost state, to Dawei and Myeik in Tanintharyi region in the south of the country. The military, which has struggled to control widespread opposition to its rule, had threatened charges of sedition or terrorism against anyone who participated in the stay-at-home protest. Business owners had also been told their properties would be seized if they participated. Some opened their stores but left them unattended to get around the threats. In one image shared widely on social media, a seller mockingly left a sign next to their food stall that said: “All menu items are available.” Beside it, empty bowls were labelled “beans”, “tofu” and “kale”. The military ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on 1 February 2021, and has inflicted deadly violence and terror in an attempt to crush opposition. A 27-year-old resident in Yangon’s Sanchaung township, who asked not to be named, said he had stayed at home, along with his family members and neighbours. “I heard some voices around by lunchtime from the main road, with people singing a military anthem. They might be military supporters marching on the street to break the silent strike,” he said. He said he was afraid to go out even after the protest had ended. “I don’t want to get into any trouble or get arrested,” he said, adding that soldiers were patrolling. Since the coup, more than 1,500 people have been killed, and at least 11,838 people have been arrested in military crackdowns, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. Detainees have been subjected to torture and mistreatment, including beatings, gender-based violence and prolonged stress positions, according to research by Human Rights Watch. Despite the risk of further military violence, some activists held small rallies prior to the silent strike on Tuesday morning. Protesters, led by students, sprinkled the streets of Yangon with red paint, the colour associated with Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy. Activists shared images of the act on Facebook, writing: “Our blood is red and we will march towards our enemy.” In Mandalay, protesters marched in the morning, chanting: “Who dares to live on the opposite side of the people?” Alongside peaceful protest movements, civilians, including many young people, have taken up arms and formed people’s defence forces. In Yangon several bombings thought to have been carried out by such groups were reported by local media on Monday. Another reportedly occurred at a police station in Myitkyina. Armed resistance groups target the military with guerrilla attacks against military targets and key infrastructure. The military, in turn, has responded by launching airstrikes, burning villages, and blocking aid to civilians. As of 27 December, about 320,900 people were internally displaced across Myanmar, as a result of the crisis and escalating conflict, according to the United Nations. A further 340,000 people were already displaced before the coup. A statement from the office of the UN secretary general António Guterres on Monday warned of “an intensification in violence, a deepening of the human rights and humanitarian crises and a rapid rise of poverty in Myanmar”. Before the anniversary of the coup, the US, Britain and Canada announced new, coordinated sanctions against Myanmar officials, including the attorney general, Thida Oo, the supreme court chief justice, Tun Tun Oo, and the anti-corruption commission chair, Tin Oo. The US said they were closely involved in the “politically motivated” prosecution of Aung San Suu Kyi. The ousted leader faces wide-ranging charges that have been widely criticised and faces spending the rest of her life in prison. The measures were welcomed by Anna Roberts, the executive director of Burma Campaign UK, who said countries should impose sanctions on companies and individuals that were financing the military. However, Roberts added that the new sanctions needed to be introduced more quickly. “It is vital to maximise pressure now while the military are more vulnerable,” she said. Rights groups have also called for further measures to block the junta’s access to foreign revenues from oil, gas, and other resources, and for the UN security council to pass a resolution instituting a global arms embargo on Myanmar, and which refers military atrocities to the international criminal court.

2/1/2022,"An independent publisher, Swift Press, has acquired Kate Clanchy’s Some Kids I Taught and What They Taught Me, after she and her original publisher Picador “part[ed] company” last month following controversy over the racial tropes and ableist descriptions in the Orwell prize-winning title. Swift Press, which was set up in June 2020, said it approached Clanchy after reading that she and Picador were no longer working together. Its reissued version of the title, which details Clanchy’s experiences as a teacher, removes the words and phrases which had prompted widespread criticism from readers and contains a new afterword from Clanchy in which she writes of how she “still think[s] that my beleaguered, faulty text is worth reading”.  The announcement about the split with Picador on 20 January followed months of controversy over Some Kids. The title won the Orwell prize and was a bestseller, until Clanchy announced on Twitter that she had wrongfully been accused of racism on Goodreads by reviewers. But readers pointed out racial stereotypes in the book such as “almond-shaped eyes” and “chocolate-coloured skin”, a reference to one student being “so small and square and Afghan with his big nose and premature moustache”, while two autistic students were said to be “jarring company”. Picador initially said the book would be updated, but subsequently announced it would be stopping distribution and returning the rights to Clanchy. Now, Some Kids has been released as an ebook by Swift Press, which said in a statement today that “it is our fundamental view as a publisher that readers should be able to make up their own minds”. According to the independent press, another indie publisher has also approached Clanchy to publish her poetry. “I was pleased to have been approached by Swift Press, and that they will allow my work to remain available to readers, who will be able to judge it for themselves,” added Clanchy. None of the phrases mentioned above, included in the original, are in the new version. “I was glad to re-engage with the text – it is a privilege for any writer – and I have listened to and benefitted from other people’s readings,” Clanchy writes. “The storm focused on particular words and phrases which I have been happy to change.” Swift Press said that Clanchy “writes about her students with deep affection, and it is clear that she wants them to do as well as they possibly can”, pointing to testimonies from her pupils about her “unequivocal care and support” for them. “Partly because she writes with an often self-lacerating honesty, and in a way that explicitly shows her moving from positions of ignorance – or even prejudice – to ones of understanding, reasonable people have disagreed as to whether she was able successfully to capture the potential tensions between difference and sameness without exacerbating them,” said the publisher. “But it is our fundamental view as a publisher that readers should be able to make up their own minds.’",Arts/Books,Kate Clanchy’s controversial memoir reissued by independent publisher,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/feb/01/kate-clanchy-independent-publisher-some-kids-i-taught
2/1/2022,"The average annual grocery bill is on track to rise by £180 this year as the UK’s worsening cost of living squeeze continues, according to the consultants Kantar. Grocery prices rose 3.8% over the four weeks to 23 January compared with the same period last year, according to the market research firm. Prices are rising fastest for fresh beef and poultry, savoury snacks, crisps, skincare and cat food but are falling for fresh bacon, vitamins and beer.  Fraser McKevitt, Kantar’s head of retail and consumer insight, said: “Prices are rising on many fronts, and the weekly shop is no exception. Taken over the course of a 12-month period, this 3.8% rise in prices could add an extra £180 to the average household’s annual grocery bill. “We’re now likely to see shoppers striving to keep costs down by searching for cheaper products and promotions. Supermarkets that can offer the best value stand to win the biggest slice of spend.” The UK’s official inflation rate hit 5.4% in December, the highest since 1992, and is on track to head above 6% in coming months as energy costs soar. Supermarket sales fell by 3.8% over the 12 weeks to 23 January, according to Kantar, because of a tough comparison with the start of 2021, when coronavirus lockdowns boosted shopping, but grocery spending remains 8% higher than pre-pandemic times. As more people embraced Veganuary or Dry January after an indulgent Christmas, sales of plant-based products and no- or low-alcohol drinks rose. Sales of alcohol-free beer climbed 5% and retailers’ own-label ranges marketed as healthy increased by 8%. While fresh fruit, salad and vegetable sales were down compared with last year, plant-based products proved more popular than ever. A record 10.7 million households bought at least one item that was a dairy alternative, a meat substitute or labelled as plant-based this January. The Kantar data also points to more people going out to socialise as Covid-19 restrictions were relaxed. The supermarket sales figures do not include on-the-go food and drink purchases, which are likely to be higher than last year, the firm said. McKevitt said: “Increasing confidence about heading out and about, combined with the return to the office, means we’re starting to see pre-pandemic shopping patterns once again. “Since the first lockdown in March 2020, shoppers have been buying in bulk and visiting the supermarket less often. But basket sizes are now 10% smaller than this time last year, hitting their lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic, while footfall increased by 5% as every major retailer was busier in their stores.” He said changing habits were most marked in London, where take-home sales of food and drink fell by 11%. “This suggests that people in the capital were the quickest to embrace eating out in cafes, pubs, and restaurants as many of us returned to city centres.” There was also evidence of people scrubbing up, as the work from home directive ended and socialising increased. Razor blade sales rose by 14%, while spending on deodorant increased by 20%.",News/Business,Annual UK grocery bill could rise by £180 amid cost of living squeeze,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/01/annual-uk-grocery-bill-could-rise-cost-of-living-squeeze
2/1/2022,"Zumretay Arkin is remembering the day she thought she might change the International Olympic Committee’s mind. It was October 2020, and human rights groups, representing Uyghur Muslims, Tibetans, and the democracy movement in Hong Kong, were granted a meeting with senior IOC figures to discuss their concerns about the Winter Olympics in Beijing. “I explained how millions of Uyghurs are being arbitrarily detained in concentration camps,” she says. “The IOC was told survivors’ stories of rapes and torture, forced sterilisation and repression. And about families who have not heard from relatives for years.  “All of us shared personal experiences of loss and sacrifice,” adds Arkin, who fled Xinjiang when she was 10 years old. “And do you know what the first thing that [the then] IOC vice-president, Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, said?” She pauses. Shakes her head. “‘The world is a complicated place’.” “That was the tone in which the IOC addressed us throughout the meeting,” she says. “It was extremely condescending. They were just like: ‘Yes, OK, but we’re not here to change the world’.” Mandie McKeown, of the International Tibetan Network, was there too. “I remember an Uyghur colleague of mine telling them about her situation, and how she had many family members missing. And the IOC simply turned around and said: ‘Many countries have had bad human rights – look at Guantánamo.’ It was unbelievable whataboutery.” The IOC did offer their sympathies, according to those present. But it also stressed that it was not the United Nations, and its primary role was to bring people together through sport. McKeown felt at the time that the IOC was burying its head in the sand. She still does. “The IOC is in a massive hole,” she says. “And it is trying to get out of it by ignoring it.” China has consistently denied human rights abuses, of course, and an informed take on the IOC’s thought gymnastics in response is offered by Michael Payne, a former senior marketing executive at the organisation who still has close ties in the Olympic movement. “The IOC has a very fine line to walk, between standing up for its values, and ensuring that during the Olympics are not subject to a given political agenda, while also respecting its host,” he says. “Anything the IOC said supporting the human rights groups would have been immediately leaked to the media and opened up a huge can of worms.” There are some in the IOC who privately believe it is unfair they get so much criticism while multinational groups operating in China rarely suffer opprobrium. Perhaps they have a point. But the IOC made its bed by awarding the Games to China. Now it has to lie in it. The only consolation is that it could have been even more of a public relations disaster. Last month 225 people died during protests in the Kazakhstan city of Almaty, which narrowly lost out to Beijing in 2015. Meanwhile, a lingering question hangs uneasily in the air of the Chinese capital before Friday’s opening ceremony. Will many of those closely associated with these Games take a harder line than the IOC? It is not looking encouraging. Sponsors have been conspicuously quiet. Some broadcasters too, although the BBC is a notable exception. Perhaps the best hope is that athletes speak out. If not, these Winter Olympics will be regarded as another Great Leap Backwards for human rights. One person determined to shake the world out of its apathy is Lhadon Tethong, an exiled Tibetan who made international headlines when she blogged on her travels through Beijing before the 2008 Olympics – until she was deported. Tethong is the co-founder of the Tibet Action Network, which recently released a report on China’s colonial boarding schools in Tibet which makes for disturbing reading. The network ‘conservatively estimates’ that at least 800,000 Tibetan children, 78% of them between six and 18, are separated from their families for weeks and sometimes months to live in schools intended to replace their Tibetan identity with a Chinese one. But there is something new and worrying she is hearing, she says: that kids as young as four and five are now being sent to boarding preschool from Monday to Friday. “Can you imagine it?” she asks. “These are the years when language is most critically being formed, and their identities are being formed, and they’re living in Chinese schools with Chinese teachers speaking Chinese, and not with their parents where they should be. “The numbers are not clear just yet. But we’re talking about, in essence, babies that are being taken from their families, being made to live in these schools, to speak another language, facing political indoctrination at the absolute tenderest age in years in such a extreme environment that even after a few months, Tibetans are reporting that their children can’t engage with their families in Tibetan any more. They just want to speak Chinese or Mandarin.” But it is not just Tibet or Xinjiang. It’s Hong Kong. And it’s the troublesome case of three-time Olympian Peng Shuai – whom Bach is meeting in person in the coming days. Before the 2008 Games in Beijing, the former IOC president Jacques Rogge suggested that hosting the Games might help China liberalise. The current incumbent, Thomas Bach, has wisely made no such promises. He would be laughed all the way back to Lausanne. However, there is little to joke about for the athletes and journalists who have travelled to Beijing with burner phones and laptops, with warnings that they face an “Orwellian surveillance state” and potential trouble for speaking out ringing in their ears. The trust in the host nation is low. And so, as the most controversial Olympics – certainly since Moscow 1980, and arguably Berlin 1936 – rumbles closer, those present face a stark choice: to speak out or stay silent. It is not as straightforward as it sounds given that some groups have urged those in Beijing to hold their tongues for their own safety. “Journalists and athletes are heading into a hazardous environment,” says Minky Worden, the director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch. “And the thing is, no one knows just how hazardous it is. All this is unprecedented in the modern Olympic era.” It is hardly encouraging either that China is ranked 177th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders’ Press Freedom Index – ahead of only Turkmenistan, North Korea and Eritrea. However Payne, who as well as being an Olympics insider recently wrote a punchy history of the Games, Toon In!, maintains the IOC will ensure that athletes and media are safe to speak out, even if that occasionally irritates the Chinese authorities. “The IOC, over 100 years, has worked very hard to prevent the Games – and, in particular the host, from being politicised,” he says. “As an example, when the head of state opens the games it’s already scripted by the IOC as to what he can say. In Salt Lake, President Bush tried to change it. And the IOC vetoed it.” Meanwhile, the old canard that sport and politics don’t mix will again be shattered again at Friday’s opening ceremony, which will be boycotted by bureaucrats from many western countries, including Britain and the US, which has referred to these Olympics as the “genocide games”. Some say it is a tribute to Bach’s negotiating skills and the power of sport to unite people that no country has opted for a full athlete boycott. Perhaps. But the IOC is not out the woods yet. Over the next three weeks it will try to perform a high-wire juggling act while being buffeted from powerful forces from all sides. In a statement to the Guardian, the IOC confirmed it had met with the human rights groups and told them that the Olympic Games are the only event that brings the entire world together in peaceful competition. “The IOC has neither the mandate nor the capability to change the laws or the political system of a sovereign country,” it added. “Given the diverse participation in the Olympic Games, the IOC must remain neutral on all global political issues.” Perhaps. But here the words of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a great friend of the Olympic movement, also come to mind. “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor,” Tutu famously warned. “If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.”",Sport/Sport,Spectre of 1936 and 1980 haunts Beijing 2022 as fear and repression breed silence,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/01/spectre-of-1936-and-1980-haunts-beijing-2022-as-fear-and-repression-breed-silence-winter-olympics
2/1/2022,"In recent months, Michigan should have been a hotbed for attempts to rig elections, like it was in 2011. That year, the Republican-led legislature distorted the voting maps so that the GOP was able to win nine of Michigan’s 14 congressional seats despite never earning more than 50.5% of the vote statewide.  A decade later, as the redistricting cycle has come around again, the dynamics are just as toxic. The battleground state broke for Joe Biden by fewer than 155,000 votes, and the Republican-controlled legislature has fought endlessly with the Democratic governor about election “audits”, voter IDs and absentee ballots. But this cycle, the state’s redistricting commission has pulled off something remarkable. Despite a flurry of legal action and very public disputes between members, it has produced some of the fairest maps in the US. How did it manage it – and will the maps survive? Neither party was involved in drawing new maps, a process that is open to abuse if politicians are allowed to allocate particular voters to particular districts in order to guarantee a win there. Instead, the responsibility fell to 13 Michiganders – four Democrats, four Republicans and five independents – who were randomly selected by the state. The Michigan Independent Citizens’ Redistricting Commission (MICRC) includes a foster care worker, a retired banker, an aspiring orthopedic surgeon, a mother of six, a college student and a real estate broker. MICRC, and the approach it epitomizes, came about thanks to Katie Fahey, a Michigan resident and political novice who posted a message on Facebook two days after the 2016 presidential election. She said she wanted to take on gerrymandering and eventually recruited more than 14,000 volunteers to campaign for an amendment to the state’s constitution. It passed with 61% of the vote and created the commission, one of the most successful ways to unrig the redistricting process so far and a potential model for other states. Combatting gerrymandering is no small feat. In 35 states, partisan politicians in the legislatures are mostly or fully in charge of redistricting, and of the maps that have been released and evaluated by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project so far, the average grade is a “D”. States led by both Republicans and Democrats – including Maryland, Texas, North Carolina, Oregon, Ohio, Wisconsin and Illinois – earned the lowest possible grade. While Republicans haven’t gerrymandered as much as Democrats originally feared – in fact, the number of Democratic-leaning seats could increase by a few this year – both parties have nearly eliminated their competition. Of the 287 completed congressional districts, only 42 (14.6%) are competitive, and 13 states have passed maps with zero competitive districts, according to an analysis from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project and RepresentUs. Part of MICRC’s success is that it’s almost entirely insulated from the legislature. In December of 2019, applications to MICRC were randomly sent to 250,000 citizens. The pool of respondents was then trimmed (at random) to 200, though 60 of the applicants had to self identify as Republicans, 60 as Democrats, and 80 affiliated with neither party. At this point, Democrats and Republicans in the legislature were allowed to strike up to 10 commissioners each, after which the final 13 were then chosen, again at random. The results were nearly revolutionary. During perhaps one of the most contentious political processes of the decade, MICRC was able to find cross-partisan agreement. Their final congressional map was approved by eight of the commission’s 13 members – two Republicans, two Democrats, and four independents – and will go into effect before the primaries this year. The congressional map was graded “A” by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. However, the process still has its critics. Republicans filed a lawsuit claiming that the map arbitrarily “fragments counties, townships, and municipalities” and that it allows too much population deviation between congressional districts. Meanwhile, good government groups were upset about the committee’s first closed-door meeting, and several media outlets sued to have records from the event released to the public. In late December, MICRC turned over documents showing that it was preparing for litigation about how it split Black voters across different districts, while previously they were geographically more concentrated. On 5 January, ​​members of the Michigan house of representatives representing Detroit and others challenged the commission’s maps, arguing that they dilute the voting strength of Black voters, particularly in and around Detroit. However, proving that point in court will be difficult, expensive and time-consuming, says Michael Li, senior counsel for the Brennan Center’s Democracy Program. Federal law dictates that minority voters have the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice, but it doesn’t set a specific threshold for what percentage of voters in a district need to be of that minority group. Li suggested that even if the challenge succeeds, it will probably lead to relatively minor changes around Detroit, as opposed to the commission having to start from scratch. Still, the pressure of drawing – and then having to defend – the map seems to be wearing on the commissioners. One accused the group’s chair of bullying her and introduced a motion to censure her, and members have even disagreed over whether to produce a “lessons learned” documentary about the process, with two refusing to participate at all. Since at least early December, commissioners have also voiced skepticism of their general counsel, who resigned abruptly last week. The episode underscores a potential lesson for states looking to adopt a similar style of commission: non-politicians may be better able to work across party lines but might must be prepared for the rancor, criticism and partisan lawsuits that follow. If the goal is fairer maps, though, the trade-off may be worth it. “On the whole, these maps are really good maps,” says Li, “and markedly different than what we’re seeing around the country.”",News/US news,The US state that fought back after Republicans tried to rig its elections,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/01/michigan-republican-effort-rig-elections-voting-rights
