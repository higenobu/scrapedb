5/2/2022,"Victoria’s budget will include a $250 payment for every household that seeks out a better power deal, along with measures to ease cost of living pressures and billions of dollars for health services, the premier, Daniel Andrews, has revealed. From 1 July until June 2023, households that log on to the government’s Energy Compare website will get a $250 one-off payment, with the government committing $250m for the scheme in Tuesday’s budget. On Monday, Andrews said the budget will include further “practical, commonsense initiatives” to deal with cost of living pressures, including an expected interest rate rise and soaring fuel and food costs thanks to inflation. But the centrepiece of the budget will be a “massive investment in health and hospitals to repair the damage that [the] pandemic has done”, he said. “Tomorrow’s comprehensive pandemic repair plan will be all about more nurses, more ambos, better care and catching up on care that could not be delivered because of Covid,” Andrews said. He said the budget will address issues such as elective surgery delays and deferred GP care, which experts say is leading to increased emergency department presentations. According to government figures released on Saturday, there are 89,611 Victorians on the waitlist for elective surgery, including about 2,700 of the most urgent category one patients. Andrews again called on whichever side wins the federal election on 21 May to continue to pay for half of the cost of running state hospitals. “No matter who [wins] the federal election, I will always argue, together with my first minister colleagues and we are very united on this, that health is core business and we need as a nation to fund this properly,” he said. The commonwealth has for years contributed 45% of hospital funding, as well as placing a funding cap when growth is above 6.5%. It lifted this to 50% during the pandemic but that arrangement is to end in September. Andrews said this decision would cost the nation about $5bn, including $1.5bn in Victoria. “That’s equivalent to the amount of money we’re spending on the biggest reform and boost to elective surgery that our state has ever seen,” he said. Announcing the $250 payments for those who log on to the Energy Compare website, Andrews said seven out of 10 households could go on to save an average of $330 each year by switching providers. “Between the average savings and the bonus, [that’s] almost $600 in your pocket that otherwise wouldn’t be there,” he said. “There’s a lot of talk about cost of living, but this is a practical action to make the energy market work for working people.” He said this would help mitigate the impact of “big energy companies, who often trade off the fact that people are too busy … [and] don’t shop around”.

There was also a $50 bonus introduced in the 2018/19 budget for every Victorian household that used the Energy Compare website. Andrews said households that have previously claimed those payments will also be eligible for this new one. While the premier would not speak to the state’s fiscal situation before the budget, he defended the debt bill, which according to the December budget update will hit $104.5bn, or 21.1% of gross state product by June this year. “We used the state budget to protect and safeguard household budgets. We make no apology for that,” he said. He said the state would grow rather than cut its way back towards a balanced budget with investments in hospitals, schools, TAFE, road and rail projects.",News/Australia news,Daniel Andrews announces $250 payment to help ease cost of living pressures,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/02/daniel-andrews-announces-250-payment-to-help-ease-cost-of-living-pressures
5/2/2022,"A leaked report commissioned by the AFL has revealed complaints made by girls and women in football umpiring who allegedly experienced sexual harassment from spectators, umpire coaches and fellow umpires. Girls and women interviewed for the study – undertaken by the University of Sydney between late 2020 and early 2021 – said they had experienced discrimination through gender-based harassment. There were also instances of racial vilification reported. Some participants said they questioned their involvement in umpiring because of the alleged abuse, according to the report which was published in August, but only made public by News Corp on Monday. The report – titled Girls and women in Australian football umpiring: Understanding registration, participation and retention – was based on the accounts of 26 current and former women umpires and one non-binary umpire across Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and ACT. Those who took part did so in the hope their experiences “may positively influence the game that they love”, the report said. “Beyond that, many expressed hope that their participation in this project might make a difference to the girls, women and other minorities that umpire in the future.” The report was commissioned by the AFL to better understand the low take-up numbers of women and girls in umpiring, which contrasts with the exponential rise in participation in women’s footy. The league said in a statement in response to the News Corp report: “The report has been a valuable resource for our team in prioritising the key initiatives to accelerate the growth in women and girls taking on umpiring roles across the country and ensuring we have a safe and welcoming pathway that allows women and girls to progress from community to AFL and AFLW level.” The report included claims of unsolicited sexual images being sent to umpires, women and girls receiving sexualised comments from spectators and fellow umpires, and repetitive unwelcome approaches from fellow umpires and umpires coaches. One umpire was quoted in the report as saying: “I used to receive messages of nudes that other umpires would send to me. And umpires during games would inappropriately touch me, like when we’re umpiring together and things like that. That’s what made me quit.” Another said: “I openly overheard a group of guys talking about my boobs at training one night … I was walking up the stairs, and I overheard them being literally like, ‘Oh my god, have you seen [redacted] tits?’” The AFL said the findings from the report have formed the basis for a number of initiatives that have been included in the Women and Girls Game Development Action Plan, which is in its final stages of completion. “The initiatives in the plan are designed to increase representation of women and girls in all parts or our game from players to umpires to coaches and administrators and are aimed at ensuring a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment for women and girls, including to lift the number of women umpires to 40%,” the AFL said.",Sport/Sport,Girls and women in umpiring allege sexual harassment in AFL-funded study,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/02/girls-and-women-in-umpiring-allege-sexual-harassment-in-afl-funded-study
5/2/2022,"The plan is clear as mud. Robbie Williams is making his biopic Better Man in Melbourne and he’s putting on two concerts to film a recreation of the 1998 Brit awards. So please wear 90s clothes – or don’t, no one will mind. You might be in the film, but the first rows will be filled with extras. And the concert is not just a concert; it is An Evening with Robbie Williams, which means we’ll also get a Richard Wilkins interview with him, plus the promise of “a guest appearance from a spokesperson from the set”. The Guardian is offered free tickets, on the condition we promise not to write anything. I buy one instead, because we have so many questions: why is one of the UK’s most successful musicians making his movie in Melbourne? Is it true that Williams will be played by a CGI monkey? Bohemian Rhapsody, this is not; I suspect Better Man will be closer to the out-and-out weirdness of Aline, which saw an adult actor play Celine Dion as a baby. At least the fashion rules are clear. On Sunday night, the second of the two shows, a sea of flannel flows towards Rod Laver Arena; there are more mullets here than the Saints’ changing room. It is easy to spot who won’t make the final edit: the fan in her “Williams ’03” jersey for instance; same for the guys puffing away on vapes, or those who won’t put down their iPhones. But even Williams is an incongruity here: a craggy 48-year-old recreating a performance from when he was 22. He doesn’t seem to have a better grip on what is happening: he tells a story about the previous night, when he came out and noticed how young the crowd was. “I was like, ‘Look at me in Melbourne, being a young person’s thing!’ It’s like I’m fucking TikTok. Then I realised, they’re all actors.” Then later, to someone at the front in the middle of a song: “Are you an actor? No? Well can you act like you’re having a good time, for fuck’s sake?” An evening with Robbie Williams turns out to be chaotic in the best possible way. Williams is 40 minutes late; two friends next to me have a fight, cry and make up all in the time it takes for him to come out. More than one person is double fisting Canadian Club. But as soon as he arrives, the bored, drunk energy in the room immediately dissipates: how can you not be swept away by a man who comes out to his own name being sung to O Fortuna? “I’m Robbie fucking Williams!” he bellows, as way of introduction. “This is my band, this is my arse, and tonight, Melbourne is ours!” We’re there to film a recreation of Williams’ performance with Tom Jones at the 1998 Brits – his first appearance at the awards after Take That split. Williams doesn’t remember it: “I don’t know what you can remember after doing three grams of coke and drunk a bottle of sambuca. I’ve seen it on telly.” Jones isn’t there because “he is too fucking expensive” – so instead we get “Australia’s premier Tom Jones impersonator”, who comes out to sing Land of a 1,000 Dances with Williams. We do the scene twice, everyone hooting and cheering with gusto. It is bewildering. It is great fun. And holding the night together is our mad ringmaster, who flashes his nipples and gallops around the stage and, occasionally, forgets why we’re all there: he sings the opening lyrics of Angel, then remembers he was supposed to tell everyone to sing along so they can film it and has to do it again. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Better Man will be for “the over 18s”, Williams tells Wilkins – “because it is my life, it is what I got up to. It’s not anodyne, it’s not vanilla, it is not PH7. It is warts and all. It is the drugs, the ups, the downs, the women, the sex.” While the British press became preoccupied with his interest in UFOs and sniffy about his move to LA, Australia has always loved Robbie unconditionally, I suspect because of a nationwide belief that he’d be good fun at a barbecue. So no one at Rod Laver minds the stop-start nature of the evening, or leaves when our “spokesperson from the set” comes out: the film’s director Michael Gracey, who made The Greatest Showman. We all want Robbie’s mad monkey film to be good. “You have been trojans,” Williams says. “I am so grateful, Melbourne.” On the walk home, I watch the 1998 Brits performance. The crowd was good, I think, but maybe we were better tonight. And Robbie, so beautiful and manic then, is probably better now too: less wild-eyed and more settled, and just so happy to be there on stage, beaming down at the wall of faces smiling back at him.",Arts/Music,"My chaotic night in the Robbie Williams biopic: tears, Tom Jones and … a CGI monkey?",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/02/my-chaotic-night-in-the-robbie-williams-biopic-tears-tom-jones-and-a-cgi-monkey
