1/8/2022,"Manchester City do not take these assignments lightly, even when presented with some unhelpful hurdles in the buildup to this game and, perhaps unsurprisingly, almost half a billion pounds’ worth of talent came out on top against a Swindon Town team 72 places below them in the pyramid. Ultimately City punished Swindon’s attempts to play them at their own game and Bernardo Silva, Gabriel Jesus, Ilkay Gündogan and Cole Palmer earned a victory that saw them ease into the FA Cup fourth round. Regardless of defeat, Swindon supporters will always cherish the moment Harry McKirdy streamed through on goal, amid the backdrop of fans collectively rising to their feet, and drilled the ball into the City net before a jam-packed Town End.  Whatever the score, Swindon supporters were determined to savour the occasion after a miserable couple of years following a team that were unceremoniously relegated to the fourth tier last season, plagued by off-field chaos. Ben Garner insisted his side would play their normal game and not resort to dirty or direct tactics but, at the same time, the closest they came to rolling out the red carpet was ordering two bins from a waste management company to provide City with the means to enjoy a post-match ice bath. This ageing, sold-out stadium was rocking at kick-off. A glance at the teamsheet made it hard to believe a Covid outbreak had decimated City’s numbers and inevitably disrupted their preparations, with Pep Guardiola and seven players among 21 of the first-team bubble that were absent here because they are isolating. Guardiola was in dialogue with the City staff crammed into the away dugout. In the end City made only four changes from the team that overcame Arsenal in the Premier League last time out as they named a starting lineup that cost a £425m to assemble, including Kevin De Brunei and Rúben Días. On paper it was a total mismatch – Swindon paid a nominal fee for just one of the players that started this game, the captain Dion Conroy – and the League Two side remain under a transfer embargo owing to the previous regime failing to pay players and staff. Despite the financial gulf both teams have the same number of players at the Africa Cup of Nations – one, with Riyad Mahrez and Jojo Wollacott away with Algeria and Ghana respectively – which meant Swindon named their 43-year-old goalkeeping coach Steve Mildenhall among the substitutes. Mildenhall’s legendary status in these parts increased tenfold when he assumed the role of de facto manager last summer after an exodus of staff and key figures – Swindon had eight contracted players in pre-season – before a takeover that led to the arrival of head coach Garner. Rodolfo Borrell, the assistant coach who took charge of City in the absence of Guardiola, had suggested they made to lean on the under-18s because players in the development squad had tested positive for Covid but the only youngster to start the game was the 19-year-old Cole Palmer, who made his league debut in November. There were seven teenagers on the bench, including the Brazilian striker Kayky, alongside two goalkeepers. It was Palmer who helped City stride into the lead on 14 minutes, the England Under-21 midfielder waltzing past Ellis Iandolo, Swindon’s longest-serving player, before sending in a delicious cross into the six-yard box, where Silva was on hand to tap in. City, as expected, dominated possession and doubled their lead without breaking sweat, seizing on a Swindon lapse. De Bruyne picked out Jesus with a diagonal pass and the striker slid the ball past Lewis Ward in the Swindon goal. Swindon struggled to get near City but the strikerMcKirdy, who scored four against Northampton last weekend, was lively and, in the first half, tried to lob Zack Steffen in the City goal. As Garner had promised, they were not going to be shy, even if sometimes their daring was to their undoing. But amid a brilliant atmosphere, it became clear Swindon supporters are grateful just to still have their club. A rousing chant of “stand up if you love the Town” brought almost everyone bar the 2,300 away supporters in the uncovered Stratton Bank End to their feet. Gündogan added a third, effortlessly dispatching a free-kick low into the corner following a clash of heads between De Bruyne and Iandolo and then City missed the chance to add to their tally. Silva was fouled by Lyden inside the box but Ward dived to his right to deny Jesus, who staggered his run up. City were comfortable and Palmer added a fourth but the Swindon substitute Jonny Williams played in McKirdy to ensure Swindon departed with a moment to remember, when the former Aston Villa striker fired through the legs through Steffen.",Sport/Football,Cole Palmer leads Manchester City’s big guns past Swindon in FA Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/07/bernardo-silva-leads-manchester-citys-big-guns-past-swindon-in-fa-cup
1/8/2022,"Dry January? Austere new year? If this stretch of the calendar is about replacing indulgence and cheer with a cold slog, it’s fitting that it sees the return of A Discovery of Witches (Sky Max/Now), telly’s most conservative supernatural saga. Pour a herbal tea, put on a cardigan that does not sparkle, and head back to a world where mythical beings, unencumbered by time, death or physical laws, use this epic freedom to argue irritably among themselves. This is the fantasy show that treats blood, lust and grotesquery as faux pas to be carefully avoided. It isn’t funny, sexy or scary, not because it fails at those things but because it refuses to attempt them. It also doesn’t think fantasy should be a gateway to anywhere. On the surface it’s about witches, daemons and vampires, but dig for subtext, search for the soul of the creation, and it’s about … no, it’s still just about witches, daemons and vampires.  Mainly, it’s about acting in a specific mode, familiar from a million earthbound terrestrial dramas shown at 9pm on wet Tuesday evenings, which is: vexed. Miffed. Positively cheesed off. A bit stressed. Many, many lines are delivered in portentous murmurs while the speaker inspects the middle distance or, in times of confrontation (“Nobody’s beyond reproach – not even YOU!”), through weakly clenched teeth. The chief beef is between a gang of compassionate Ws, Ds and Vs led by the show’s romantic protagonists – aeon-spanning vampire Matthew (Matthew Goode) and his increasingly powerful witch wife Diana (Teresa Palmer) – and the Congregation, a reactionary council dominated by smugly cunning vampire Gerbert d’Aurillac. Gerbert is played by Trevor Eve, who knows his way around a drama that takes itself too seriously and is in his element here, often having fun with line readings by inserting a … colossal pause where the viewer, and indeed recognisable English idiom, least expects … it. His sidekick in the pursuit of mild evil: Owen Teale as senior witch Peter Knox, disgruntled and crass like a resentful divorcee. Even the arch villains are less awesome monsters than slightly annoying gits. Anyway, where are we as the third – to some extent climactic – and final season begins? We’re around a long oak table in a luxurious French castle retreat and, although the characters in this show seem as if they could simply own a holiday home there, there is dark business to discuss. This is the HQ of vampire matriarch Ysabeau (Lindsay Duncan), where all three types of creature have gathered to plot their response to a rare and shocking killing at the end of season two. Millennia of passive-aggressive narking are about to come to a head. Key to the ultimate resolution of the story will be Diana’s quest to find the lost pages of The Book of Life, a mystical tome carrying secrets that perhaps only she has the ability to unlock. That strand might not cohere very effectively as it winds along – it’s a magic book that fixes stuff and tells people things when the narrative requires it to – but it does prompt Diana’s last push towards self-actualisation. There’s a satisfying neatness in the way someone who began as a blushing newcomer steadily becomes the strongest player in the game. The looming denouement also obliges Matthew to atone for the carnage he has wrought across the centuries, this being the dire consequence of the “blood rage” – basically, a catastrophic loss of manners, which is a big deal in this show. It has dogged him and his family, and may be connected to a series of murders in present-day Oxford. But there is a problem. One that has hampered A Discovery of Witches since season one, episode one: Matthew Goode plays this undead beast as clipped and inert, you cannot buy him as having unleashed any chaos. He’s aristocratic, but not in the classic vampire mould, ie, a parasitical outcast who envies feeling, fallible humans while his pale influence hovers half-seen over countless benighted generations. It’s hard to imagine Matthew having a strong view either way. Matthew does, however, want to undo his clan’s bloodlust by harnessing genetics, an odd concession to reality that leads eventually to a showdown: Diana storms into the Congregation’s premises and demands to speak to the manager. Here, A Discovery of Witches finally finds its point: witches, daemons and vampires should renounce their rivalries, interbreed, live in tolerant harmony and forget all this eternal blood-war nonsense. Which is just as well, because no one seemed that bothered by it in the first place.",Arts/Television & radio,A Discovery of Witches review – hide the sex and blood!
