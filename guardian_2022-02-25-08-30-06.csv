2/25/2022,"It is undoubtedly one of the more remarkable managerial appointments in recent history, and Mark Hughes’s unveiling as the new Bradford City manager may not have been possible at all had the Bantams’ chief executive, Ryan Sparks, not been so thorough when it comes to checking his email account. The League Two strugglers caused a huge shock on Thursday when they announced that Hughes, the former Manchester City and Southampton manager who has never taken charge of a club outside the Premier League, had been appointed as Derek Adams’ successor on a deal until the summer of 2024.  The move marks Hughes’s return to management since being sacked by Saints over three years ago, but it almost didn’t come to fruition at all after the initial contact between Hughes’s representatives and Bradford was nearly ignored after the email in question went straight to the junk folder of Sparks, the youngest chief executive in the EFL. Thankfully, he managed to spot the email in time. “The truth of the matter is when it actually came through, we’ve had some issues with our emails and it was in my junk folder,” Sparks explained. “I go through that every day and obviously I made a call very quickly to his representatives and explained: ‘Apologies for the three-hour delay, I’m usually on it but I would like to have a conversation with Mark.’” Hughes says he will not enter with preconceptions about the job and the players he is inheriting. “I’m not going to come in here and compare and contrast,” he said at his unveiling on Thursday. “I will work with what I’ve got in front of me and that’s the best way to approach things. “I’ve managed at the top level but even there you had differing levels of ability within groups. It’s about maximising the opportunity we have here and giving them a plan and an understanding of what to do to win games. Hopefully we’ll be able to implement that and if you’re clear in your mind over what’s expected, we’ll be in a good place.” Hughes insisted he always felt he would return to management, even if his arrival at Bradford is something of a shock. “I always envisaged I’d get back in at some point,” the 58-year-old said. “It’s fair to say it’s been longer than I anticipated and there are reasons behind that. I’ve still got many years left and I wasn’t prepared for the game to retire me. I’m still a young man in football terms. I’d like to have the option to retire myself when I feel it’s time rather than the game do that for me.”",Sport/Football,Mark Hughes off managerial junk heap after Bradford CEO spots filtered email,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/mark-hughes-bradford-manager-shock-return
2/25/2022,"Sydney has experienced its wettest summer in three decades and the most humid season in 10 years with more torrential rain forecast for the New South Wales north coast and south-east Queensland over the coming days. Weatherzone meteorologist Ben Domensino said Sydney had received 570mm of rain so far this summer – the highest total since 1991.  It has also been the most humid summer in a decade. Domensino said Sydney hadn’t been as sticky since 2011 which was also a La Niña summer. Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Dean Narramore said rainfall totals in some areas stretching from Byron Bay in NSW up to Fraser Island in Queensland could exceed 300mm in the coming days. “This is a dangerous setup as very heavy rainfall falls over already saturated soils,” Narramore said on Thursday afternoon. He warned people living near rivers or creeks their homes could be inundated and there was a risk of dangerous flash flooding. The body of a motorcyclist missing in the Queensland floods was found on Thursday after his bike was swept away by rising water the previous day. A 63-year-old woman was also killed in the floods. Her body was found in her car submerged in floodwaters west of Eumundi on the Sunshine Coast on Wednesday morning. The Bureau of Meteorology said “very dangerous, slow-moving storms” were forecast to hit west of the Sunshine Coast on Friday morning. A severe thunderstorm warning was also listed for south-east Queensland, parts of Gympie and Noosa, with intense rainfall projected to lead to “dangerous, life-threatening flash flooding” in the area. A severe weather warning projecting damaging winds and intense rainfall remained in place for Wide Bay and Burnett, the south-east coast and parts of Darling Downs and Granite Belt, including Brisbane. “Heavy rainfall which may lead to flash flooding is forecast to continue over parts of south-east Queensland today and potentially through Saturday morning,” the BoM warned. “Locally intense rainfall leading to dangerous and life-threatening flash flooding is possible with thunderstorms during this period, particularly over areas north of Brisbane. Six-hourly rainfall totals in excess of 300mm are possible. “Damaging wind gusts with peak gusts in excess of 90 km/h are possible over areas east of about Seventeen Seventy to Brisbane, although most likely near the coast north of Maroochydore.” More than a dozen flood warnings were in place across Queensland, with heavy rainfall in excess of 200mm recorded over the past 24 hours in the Mary River catchment at Gympie. The mid-north coast and central coast copped the brunt of the NSW rain on Thursday with more than 100mm falling in several areas in the space of 24 hours. On the central coast, Bateau Bay recorded 116mm, Erina Heights 136mm, Mount Elliott 115mm and Wamberal Reservoir 140mm since 9am on Thursday. Further north, Bellingen recorded 173mm, Bowraville 112mm, Dorrigo 103mm, Glennifer 135mm and Gosford 136mm. An offshore surface trough near the Queensland-NSW border is expected to bring further downpours to northern NSW and south-east Queensland on Friday. The NSW SES issued an evacuation warning for low-lying areas along the Nambucca River and door knocked homes overnight. Some 630 callouts were received by the SES in the 24 hours to 6am on Thursday with 27 flood rescues – predominantly from vehicles. Many of the calls for help were for sandbagging to protect against flooding and for damaged roofs. The northern rivers, mid-north coast and central coast are the areas of concern for the SES on Friday. Assistant commissioner Dean Storey told the ABC there was a “very concerning weather system ... sitting just off the coast and due to make landfall”.",News/Australia news,Life-threatening floods forecast for Queensland as Sydney records wettest summer in 30 years,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/sydney-records-wettest-summer-in-30-years-with-nsw-and-queensland-facing-further-torrential-rain

2/25/2022,"Marco Fusinato is counting on his forthcoming show at the Venice Biennale being immediately disliked. Outlining his contribution as Australia’s representative at the world’s oldest art show this week, the 57-year-old Melbourne-based contemporary artist and noise musician said Desastres was the product of a nightmarish two years enduring the world’s longest lockdown.  “There’s [been] no site visits, you just have to imagine this piece, how it’s going to sit in the pavilion,” he said. “There’s no meetings with any engineers or technicians on site. It’s all been done from a bedroom through a pus of Zoom meetings.” The Australia Council describes Fusinato’s Venice exhibition as an “experimental noise project that synchronises sound with image and takes the form of a durational solo performance as installation”. The noise will be generated by the artist improvising on an electric guitar, using the instrument as “a signal generator”, he explains, “that will produce slabs of noise, saturated feedback and what I call discordant intensities, that will then trigger a deluge of images”. The artist spent much of Melbourne’s marathon 262-day lockdown collecting images already in the public domain from the internet, a practice he admits has become something of a compulsion over the years. His exhibition/installation, which will open in Venice on 23 April and run through until 27 November, will feature “a morass of disparate and disconnected images that have no real theme as such, but I collect images that I think are fucked, whatever that may mean”. The press kit accompanying the announcement contained a selection of these black and white images, which are presented as a score and include a photo of a cat vomiting, another of a dead swan, and a third of a pile of faeces. Fusinato said he was not concerned about how his audiences might react to his work – which he describes as “bleak, marginal and unpopular” – as long as they do react. “I really want the audience to remember they’re alive – that’s really important for me in my work, that [the audience] has a pulse,” he said. “There’s an assumption that an artist makes work to be liked, which I find completely absurd.” Museum and gallery spaces have gone from places of contemplation to ones of entertainment, he said. “And I’m interested in playing with that idea. A lot of older people get pissed off that this shift has happened. Well, deal with it. I want to amplify that and really play with it … I want to saturate the audience with spectacle.” Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning Fusinato’s curator, Alexie Glass-Kantor, said the Venice Biennale required all contributing countries to produce a stakeholder matrix. “Apparently we were the first artistic team for whom 60% of our first stakeholders were people who don’t like the work,” she enthused. It’s all about grabbing the audience’s attention, she explained. “We are aware that when people walk into a pavilion at Venice they look for three seconds. “There’s so much work in Venice that people judge quickly. We want you to walk in and if you’re going to hate it, then hate it right away. And if you’re going to like it and want to stay longer or push yourself, do that, come back the next day, it’s up to you.” Glass-Kantor cited Fusinato’s background – the son of Italian immigrant peasants, raised in Melbourne’s working-class suburb of Noble Park – as evidence the artist’s work is neither inaccessible nor elitist. “But it’s not just there to reduce the complexity of the times in which we live,” she said. “It completely engages with the full and layered and granular and constantly shape-shifting nature of the times in which we find ourselves.”",Arts/Art and design,"‘Bleak, marginal and unpopular’: Australia unveils divisive exhibition for Venice Biennale",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/25/bleak-marginal-and-unpopular-australia-unveils-divisive-exhibition-for-venice-biennale
2/25/2022,"Leeds will have to defy history if they are to win the Super League title after labouring their way to a third successive defeat to start the new season, this time coming unstuck against Catalans Dragons on a frustrating evening for the eight-times champions. No team in the modern era has ever reached the Grand Final, let alone won it, having lost their first three games of a season, and here the Rhinos were beaten by two tries to one to remain winless in 2022. While nothing is won in February, these are concerning times for Leeds supporters, whose side are yet to click and were largely ineffective against a Catalans side that have won two of their opening three games.  Their only points of the night came when Blake Austin scored in the first half and at that stage, Leeds led 4-0. But tries either side of half-time from Fouad Yaha and Joe Chan consigned the Rhinos to a third straight defeat, and their night was made even worse after a potentially serious injury to forward Alex Mellor, who was stretchered from the field and then taken to hospital with a neck injury, though Leeds are hopeful that is a precautionary measure. “The game never got any real flow to it, and we said at half-time that the first team to get some tempo in their game would bring it home, but it never really got that far,” their coach, Richard Agar, said. “Our ability to execute was so far off the mark. There were times when it was painful to watch.” Catalans, much like Leeds, were way below the form which took them to last year’s Grand Final. But they were just about good enough here to pick up a second win of the season, with their defensive effort in particular well worthy of a mention on a stop-start night at Headingley. Without a number of key forwards, Catalans withstood pressure aplenty from the Rhinos in the final minutes, not least when their half-back, Mitchell Pearce, was sin-binned for a dangerous tackle. Steve McNamara, the Catalans coach, described that moment as “pathetic”, before being equally critical of a disallowed try for Yaha in the second half which would have put the result beyond doubt. “Wow,” he said. “Our owner is recovering in France and I hope he wasn’t watching at that point or it would have set him back.” Catalans also have a concern to a key player, after the reigning Man of Steel, Sam Tomkins, left the field with a knee injury which will be assessed in the coming days. “We haven’t been great defensively so far this season and we had to withstand a lot of pressure at the end,” McNamara said. “We were out on our feet. I was sick of hearing about the players Leeds had not playing, it’s all you guys talk about. We’re concerned with the players who are playing, not who aren’t.”",Sport/Sport,Joe Chan’s try for Catalans edges messy match to keep Leeds winless,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/24/leeds-rhinos-catalans-dragons-super-league-match-report
2/25/2022,"For weeks, Joe Biden has issued urgent warnings that a Russian invasion of Ukraine could happen at any moment. The moment came overnight, when Russian troops began attacking Ukraine by land, air and sea. For the US president – increasingly embattled at home by a resurgent Republican party – it was evidence that the White House had largely assessed the Ukraine crisis correctly, even though their preference would have been to be wrong about their predictions of a disastrous war in Europe.  Now the conflict has dumped a huge foreign policy crisis into an already difficult second year in office for Biden, with a likely backlash looming in November’s midterm elections. With few exceptions, though, he largely has the Democratic party behind him and the Republicans are split, with many backing Biden even as others take various potshots at his presidency. But, for the moment, there is the immediate invasion to deal with. On Thursday morning, Biden met in the Situation Room with his National Security Council to discuss the latest developments in Ukraine. He then met virtually with the leaders of the G7, where they agreed to move forward on “devastating packages of sanctions”. Biden was preparing to deliver remarks from the East Room of the White House this afternoon. “President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering,” Biden said in a statement. “Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.” Biden has pledged that the US would not send troops to Ukraine, warning that to do so would risk a wider war in Europe. But the US has provided arms supplies and sent additional troops to the Baltic states as part of his promise to “defend every inch of Nato territory”. “Sacred” was how the US president described the US commitment to Nato’s article 5, in which an attack on any member nation triggers an allied military response. Domestically, the Biden administration has so far been praised for its decision to quickly declassify intelligence, revealing Putin’s secret plans in real time. Though it was not enough to deter Putin, it helped Washington forge a united front against Moscow in the shadow of the administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan last year that left the US weaker in the eyes of many allies and foes around the world. But after multiple high-profile intelligence failures, the US’s assessment proved largely correct. And when Biden said he believed that Putin had already made the decision to attack, it appears he was right. The accuracy of the intelligence shared by the US, and the unity of the transatlantic alliance, may help give the US renewed credibility on the world stage, where Biden has repeatedly warned that democracies are under threat. In Congress, members have broadly condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine and urged the Biden administration to implement the long-promised paralyzing sanctions. Many Republicans have criticized the administration’s response so far as too little too late, even though senators failed to agree to a bipartisan sanctions package against Russia before leaving Washington for a week-long recess. They settled instead for issuing a strongly worded statement. Underscoring the deep polarization Biden faces at home, a number of Republicans tried to blame him for enabling Putin, including many of the same officials who remained silent as Trump praised and flattered the Russian president. “I have earlier criticized the president and I will repeat some of that,” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said Thursday. “I think the precipitous withdrawal from Afghanistan in August … was an invitation to the autocrats of the world that maybe this was a good time to make a move.” McConnell nevertheless claimed to be united with Biden. “We are where we are… We’re all together at this point and we need to be together about what should be done.” House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, however, made no mention of the US president in a statement condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as “reckless and evil”. “Putin’s actions must be met with serious consequence. This act of war is intended to rewrite history and more concerning, upend the balance of power in Europe. Putin must be held accountable for his actions,” he said. In a bizarre interview on Fox News, Donald Trump mistakenly stated that it was the US, not Russia, invading Ukraine. He was quickly corrected, but spent much of the appearance airing old grievances and attacking his successor. Repeating the baseless claim that the election was stolen, Trump concluded: “It all happened because of a rigged election.” US stock markets dropped sharply on Thursday as investors waited to hear more about what sanctions Biden would impose on Russia. After the assault began, the price of oil passed $100 a barrel for the first time since 2014, a rise that will drive up fuel prices even as the US wrestles with the worst inflation in decades. Investors were reassured by Biden’s comments that sanctions would not affect the oil and gas markets and stocks recovered their losses as the oil price fell. US trade with Russia is relatively small but the conflict’s impact on oil prices was driving up gas prices even before the invasion and there will – no doubt – be more troubling days ahead. In a press conference last week, Biden warned Americans that war in Europe would have consequences for US consumers, already suffering from soaring inflation. “I will not pretend this will be painless,” he said. The federal government has also warned government agencies and operators of critical infrastructure to take proactive security measures against potential cyberthreats from Russia. Biden said he would do everything to alleviate the economic pinch, including to tap the US national oil reserves, which he has already done in his effort to combat the fastest increase in US inflation in three decades. Higher prices pose an immediate political and economic challenge for the president, whose approval ratings have slumped amid rising gas and food prices. Republicans have blamed Democrats for inflation, which is top of mind for voters ahead of this year’s midterm elections in November.

2/25/2022,"Cyber experts have identified a new strain of computer-disabling malware unleashed on Ukrainian targets as part of Russia’s offensive, as the UK government and banks said they were on alert for online attacks. Russia was widely expected to launch a cyber assault alongside its military campaign, and the run-up to the invasion of Ukraine was marked by the deployment of “wiper” malware . A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, which paralyses websites by bombarding them with spurious information requests, also hit Ukrainian government sites.  On Wednesday, ESET Research Labs, a Slovakia-based cybersecurity company, said it had detected a new piece of data-wiping malware on hundreds of machines in Ukraine. ESET said large organisations had been affected, while security experts at Symantec’s threat intelligence team said the malware had affected Ukrainian government contractors in Latvia and Lithuania and a financial institution in Ukraine. ESET has called the malware, which renders computers inoperable by disabling rebooting, HermeticWiper. The NotPetya attack of 2017, which devastated Ukrainian businesses, was a wiper attack that encrypted computers irretrievably and spilled over into other countries, causing $10bn (£7.5bn) of damage worldwide. Alexi Drew, a senior analyst at RAND Europe, a research institute, said cyber offensives carried the risk of escalating rapidly if attacks spill over widely into other countries, although in the case of HermeticWiper the malware does not appear to be self-propogating, whereas NotPetya was able to spread. Further attacks, however, could be different, she added. “There’s a history of cyber-attacks not staying where they’re meant to go. If you look at NotPetya, the splash damage there was significant. There is a danger here of escalation because offensive cyber activity is fundamentally not very good at staying where you put it.” Priti Patel said officials were on alert for cyber-attacks and disinformation campaigns from Moscow. “As we monitor developments, we will be especially mindful of the potential for cyber-attacks and disinformation emanating from Russia,” the home secretary said. The chief executive of Lloyds Bank, Charlie Nunn, said on Thursday the lender was on “heightened alert … internally around our cyber risk controls, and we’ve been focused on this for quite a while”. Preparation for potential cyber-attacks was discussed in a meeting between the government and banking industry leaders on Wednesday, Nunn added. According to Symantec, the wiper attack that hit Ukraine this week had been planned for some time. One Ukrainian organisation suffered an initial hack in December last year that was related to the recent attack. DDoS attacks were also deployed ahead of the military offensive in order to spread confusion, according to the US cybersecurity firm Mandiant. In a DDoS attack, websites are deluged with vexatious requests for information and become unreachable. The targets on Wednesday included the Ukrainian defence ministry and PrivatBank, Ukraine’s largest commercial bank. “It’s not so much the technical disruption, it’s what it does to undermine confidence, like in the financial sector. It gets people quite nervous. It’s more that kind of secondary impact,” said Jamie Collier, a Mandiant consultant, who described a DDoS as akin to stuffing a thousand envelopes through a letterbox every second. However, Dr Lennart Maschmeyer at the Center for Security Studies at the Swiss university ETH Zurich, said Russia’s cyber strategy so far seemed more improvised. “A plausible scenario for more devastating cyber-attacks was that Russia had planned this invasion for a long time, and prepositioned implants across Ukraine’s critical infrastructure in order to cause mass disruptions coinciding with the military invasion. That does not seem to be the case. The cyber operations we have seen do not show long preparation, and instead look rather haphazard,” he said.

2/25/2022,"After warning medical professionals to be on the lookout for a baffling neurological condition that produced memory loss, muscle wasting and severe cognitive decline, authorities in the Canadian province of New Brunswick have concluded that no such illness exists, a finding that has prompted skepticism and disbelief as families search for answers. New Brunswick officials last year flagged a possible “cluster” of residents suffering from an unknown neurological syndrome, similar to those of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Symptoms were varied and dramatic: some patients started drooling, and others felt as though bugs were crawling on their skin.  On Thursday, the province released the findings of its oversight committee, concluding that none of the 48 cases met the definition of an unknown brain syndrome and that the victims were instead probably suffering from known diseases. “The oversight committee has unanimously agreed that these 48 people should never have been identified as having a neurological syndrome of unknown cause, and that based on the evidence reviewed, no such syndrome exists,” Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health for New Brunswick, told reporters Thursday. “But I stress again, this does not mean that these people aren’t seriously ill. It means they are ill with a known neurological condition.” But the province’s conclusion is unlikely to satisfy family members, many of whom have watched helplessly as those close to them quickly deteriorate. A previous report released by the province found no environmental exposures that linked the patients together, leading families to suspect the province was prepared to rule out existence of a cluster. “You always hang on to a sliver of hope and [that] they’ll reverse course,” said Steve Ellis, whose father Roger was diagnosed in 2019. “But they did the opposite.” Ellis said he and other families met the province’s health minister and chief medical officer before the release of the report. “They didn’t answer any of our questions. It was political theatre at its worst,” he said. “I knew it wasn’t going to be good. But I didn’t expect it to be this hurtful.” In recent weeks, families of those within the cluster, including Ellis, received letters from the provincial government, suggesting they may have a yet-undiagnosed condition. The report also cast doubt on the work of Dr Alier Marrero, the New Brunswick doctor who first flagged the cluster and has treated most of the patients, saying it “could not conclude that the main referring neurologist had sought second opinions” when diagnosing cases. In the future, the committee recommended a second specialist review cases to determine whether a patient has a new and unknown disease. The Guardian has seen a letter sent last week in which Marrero pleaded for help to Canada’s chief public health officer Theresa Tam, and to Russell, New Brunswick’s chief medical officer. Marrero wrote that he had a backlog of 100 patients referred to him by other doctors whose symptoms appeared to fit the case description, but lacked the resources to investigate each case. Marrero wrote that he was “quite concerned” by how many young people were in that backlog of cases. Officials at Thursday’s press conference disputed they had been advised that multiple households had more than one member showing neurological symptoms. But Marrero’s letter warned of at least 12 households with multiple cases, a finding he said raised concerns over “potential human-to-human transmission or a possible common root cause” of the suspected illness. “With these latest developments, I am concerned for my patients and, from a public health standpoint, for the general population,” he wrote. “I believe there is an urgency to act promptly and use all means necessary to investigate and get to the roots cause or causes of the above issues.” Kat Lanteigne, executive director of Bloodwatch, said officials presenting the report had “misled the public” about the scope of possible cases, and said the latest report lacked scientific rigour. “It’s a sham. It’s an absolute public health sham,” said Kat Lanteigne, executive director of Bloodwatch. “They haven’t done any additional testing. They have not tested for neurotoxins. They did not run a control group for their epidemiological study. Their data is wholly insufficient.” Experts have previously told the Guardian it is possible for patients to have known diseases that are triggered by a common cause. Lanteigne, who has been in contact with families, says she has advised them to get legal counsel as they explore their options to “hold both the government of New Brunswick and the Public Health Agency of Canada accountable for their failings”. “These families are being crushed and they need help,” she said. “They need answers.”",News/World news,Victims dismayed as Canadian inquiry finds mystery syndrome does not exist,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/canada-new-brunswick-mystery-illness-syndrome
2/25/2022,"Borussia Dortmund were the favourites to win the Europa League before this tie with Rangers. By the time it concluded, sadly though that was for neutrals, the German side were eliminated from the competition. For Giovanni van Bronckhorst, who has watched Rangers stutter on the domestic front, this felt a timely success.  Rangers had the aim of not wasting the lead earned by an outstanding display at Signal Iduna Park and duly delivered. Dortmund’s showing amid a raucous atmosphere on Glasgow’s south side was markedly better than in front of their own support but they proved unable to turn the tide. Over 180 minutes, Rangers played the more effective football. Van Bronckhorst and his team will bounce into the last 16, with Marco Rose left to field questions about an embarrassing outcome for Dortmund. “This is a big moment for us as a club,” said Van Bronckhorst. “Last 16, there are only really tough teams left. We are just happy to be among them.” High praise of Rangers’ first-leg performance, while valid, required context. Unfortunately for Van Bronckhorst and his players, 90 minutes of the tie remained against a free-scoring side. Dortmund recovered from their home loss to Rangers by trouncing Borussia Mönchengladbach 6-0 at the weekend. Prior to this game, Dortmund had played seven in 2022 that had featured more than 40 goals. Unsurprisingly, they opened positively. Jude Bellingham bundled the ball against Allan McGregor’s left-hand post from a Julian Brandt corner inside four minutes. Donyell Malen’s snapshot from just outside the area bounced narrowly wide. Rangers had been forced into their defensive third for the majority of the first quarter, adding to the craziness of Brandt’s next moment. Ryan Kent was facing away from goal and offering no particular threat at all when Brandt dropped a lazy leg into his path. As Kent toppled, a penalty was the straightforward outcome. James Tavernier slotted it home, high beyond the diving Gregor Kobel. Rangers, having been outplayed, now held a three-goal advantage. Brandt stung McGregor’s palms as Dortmund pursued swift salvation. It arrived after 31 minutes, Bellingham enjoying the break of the ball from Connor Goldson before beating McGregor with a calm finish. Rangers could rue the softness of the goal but parity was valid. Scott Arfield was denied by Kobel and Alfredo Morelos blasted the rebound against Mats Hummels. Arfield should, in truth, have squared to Kent. McGregor produced a terrific diving save to deny Malen. Before a pulsating first half closed, Dortmund edged in front on the night. Brandt played a ball into the six-yard area that was flicked beyond McGregor by the impressive Malen. Dortmund’s collective reaction demonstrated their belief that the last 16 was now a wholly legitimate aspiration. Real Betis advanced by holding Zenit St Petersburg to a goalless draw at home and winning 3-2 on aggregate. The Russians were denied a late goal that would have sent the game into extra-time as a VAR review spotted a foul in the build up to Dmitri Chistyakov's strike.Earlier, six-times winners Sevilla were made to sweat to reach the last 16 as they were beaten 1-0 at Dinamo Zagreb and had to survive a nervy finale with 10 men before progressing 3-2 on aggregate. Sevilla's Marcos Acuña was punished when the ball bounced on to his hand and Mislav Orsic slotted home the penalty in the 65th minute. Thomas Delaney was sent off for a second booking in the 91st and Dinamo hemmed the Spaniards into their area for the six minutes of added time, even throwing their goalkeeper up to contest a late free kick.Porto also had to scrap deep into added time to earn their place in the last 16, drawing 2-2 at Lazio to squeeze through 4-3 on aggregate. RB Leipzig won 3-1 at Real Sociedad to progress 5-3 on aggregate while Atalanta hammered Olympiakos 3-0 to complete a 5-1 aggregate win. Braga needed a penalty shootout to defeat Sheriff Tiraspol after drawing 2-2 over the two legs. The interval switch to five at the back by Van Bronckhorst was to prove a tactical masterstroke. “We didn’t have the same vibe in the second half,” admitted Bellingham. Morelos twice came close to extending Rangers’ lead within 10 minutes of the restart. Tavernier prevailed where his teammate could not, with a fierce back-post finish after Hummels swiped at and only partly connected with a Calvin Bassey cross from Rangers’ left. Dreadful defending had been a feature of Dortmund’s play a week earlier. Tavernier had no cause to care; the full-back has scored three goals in two games against one of Europe’s elite teams. The visitors’ situation was now desperate. Marco Reus stumbled after rounding McGregor, with the experienced forward due credit for not tumbling under an earlier challenge from Leon Balogun that could have resulted in a penalty. Controversy did follow. Emre Can won a free-kick, via VAR, after appearing to kick the ground before Morelos stole possession just inside the Dortmund half. Rangers had briefly celebrated a third, Morelos having marched down on goal before passing for Kent to tap home. They were denied that lead, which appeared unfair on further viewing. Dortmund still needed two to force extra time. Their chances of scoring had been reduced by Bellingham’s lack of prominence during the second period. Equally ominous for them was the recurring menace shown by Rangers on the break. There was to be no further scoring; the historic result was greeted by Ibrox euphoria.",Sport/Football,James Tavernier’s double for Rangers dumps Dortmund out of Europa League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/rangers-borussia-dortmund-europa-league-play-off-second-leg-match-report
2/25/2022,"This could be the difference between fourth place and frustration. Arsenal looked on the verge of defeat here until Nicolas Pépé, with his first Premier League goal since May, equalised Hwang Hee-chan’s early effort and at that point consolidation of fifth spot hardly seemed the end of the world. It would prevent Wolves leapfrogging them, at least, but much better was to come. Deep into six minutes of injury time, Alexandre Lacazette was freed by slick interplay between Martin Ødegaard and Eddie Nketiah, dinking an effort towards goal. The shot was going wide but José Sá, the away keeper, deflected it in with his right glove and a wild set of celebrations underlined what this meant. Mikel Arteta had promised that their top-four pursuit would be a rollercoaster ride but it remains firmly in Arsenal’s hands. The horrendous events in Ukraine meant football felt of scant consequence in the buildup to this match but, in its specific context, the ramifications for the Champions League race would be significant. Arsenal had squeaked past Wolves at Molineux but the sides were only separated by two points at the outset here, even if the hosts had played a game more.  So Hwang’s opener ratcheted the tension skywards. Arsenal’s defensive security has been admirable in recent months, not least when holding out with 10 men against the same opponents almost a fortnight ago, but they were undone by an uncharacteristically shoddy error from Gabriel Magalhães. The centre-back had been the matchwinner in the previous encounter but here, guarding a long pass down the left as Raúl Jiménez gave chase, he was sloppy. An attempted backpass to Aaron Ramsdale was executed without enough purchase or, crucially, a look up. In nipped Hwang with the keeper stranded and his tightly-angled finish was made to look simple. Arsenal had already been warned when Romain Saïss diverted past Ramsdale and, having been flagged offside, saw the ensuing VAR review continue for longer than Arteta might have felt comfortable. Their defence was giving space up liberally and, in the 13th minute, Wolves should have gone two up. Jiménez was playing here for the first time since, in November 2020, he fractured his skull in a sickening clash of heads at the Clock End; having marauded with intent from the off he profited from a smart through pass from Daniel Podence, who had occupied a clever position on the inside right, but dragged wide when a goal seemed likely. Having shaken off these episodes, Arsenal did not play badly. A side less adept than Wolves at crowding, blocking and scrambling clear inside their own penalty area would have conceded before half-time. Jose Semedo had made a crucial challenge on Gabriel Martinelli inside the opening half-minute while, in a high-octane spell after the quarter-hour, Alexandre Lacazette screwed wide from a difficult angle and Saïss blocked brilliantly from Ødegaard. Max Kilman did even better to deny Lacazette in the 32nd minute after Kieran Tierney had capitalised on Sá’s misreading of a high ball, while Martinelli stabbed over shortly afterwards. Emile Smith Rowe’s illness meant Martinelli returned to the side after serving a one-game ban for being dismissed at Wolves’ home. His sending-off was among the recent calls that led Arteta to ask for a meeting with Professional Game Match Officials Limited, a request to which the referees’ body has agreed. The Emirates seethed with righteous indignation, a powerful tool when used well, at the merest hint of injustice here but there was little room for griping by the interval. Sá denied Martinelli but Wolves had not been outrageously lucky. The devilishly clever Podence released Hwang with a sumptuous reverse pass straight after the restart but, as the forward ran out of room, Ramsale diverted his shot agonisingly wide. It was another reminder for Arsenal that Wolves’ construction can be devastatingly precise. Arsenal’s became frayed. There was no doubting their workrate, as Lacazette showed when haring back to his own byline to dispossess Joao Moutinho, but Arteta’s discussions with his assistant Steve Round grew increasingly urgent. When they did create a reasonable opening, just before the hour, Lacazette spun onto Martinelli’s cross but was off target again. Lacazette, whose night was mixed until that last-gasp flourish, won a free-kick 22 yards out after a determined burst but subsequently wasted it. Wolves looked assured, not to mention happy to run down the clock when it suited, and were hardly under siege as the closing stages approached. Arteta foraged among an outwardly uninspiring set of substitute options and sought a turn from Pépé. Lacazette almost equalised, forcing Sa to parry, and a late storm seemed inevitable. Wolves looked capable of holding out, though, until the Ivorian struck. His finish was marvellous, turning and finishing in one movement after a cutback from another replacement, Nketiah. Chances came and went at either end in a frantic finish, Pedro Neto and Bukayo Saka coming close, but then arrived the kind of intervention that defines a season.",Sport/Football,Lacazette forces late Arsenal winner to complete comeback against Wolves,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/arsenal-wolves-premier-league-match-report
2/25/2022,"A juror in Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal trial who might not have disclosed childhood sexual abuse during jury selection for the high-profile case will now be questioned publicly as Maxwell’s team seeks a retrial, court papers released on Thursday said. One newly released document also includes the written questionnaire that Juror No 50 completed during the selection process. In response to the question “Have you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” the juror marked the “no” box.  Maxwell was found guilty on 29 December of sex trafficking and other related counts for coordinating disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls, some as young as 14. Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose social circle was a roster of powerful and global figures, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking of teen girls. He killed himself about one month later in a Manhattan jail pending trial. Controversy over Juror No 50, who has identified himself in media interviews as Scotty David, unfolded shortly after Maxwell’s trial. David told journalists that he was sexually abused in childhood. David alleged that he told other panelists about this abuse – helping them view things from a victim’s point of view. Juror 50 will undergo questioning on 8 March, the papers said. “Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his own experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection,” Judge Alison Nathan wrote in a decision released Thursday. Nathan added: “Juror 50’s post-trial statements are ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety’ – namely, a false statement during jury selection – has occurred.” She said: “To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be explored.” Nathan also said that she cannot make a decision on Maxwell’s request for a retrial solely based upon David’s statements in the press and so ruled that he be questioned in court. “The court therefore orders that a hearing take place at which the court will question Juror 50 under oath,” Nathan wrote. David’s statements about possible previous abuse spurred questions as then-prospective jurors filled out questionnaires during selection proceedings – which directly asked about sexual abuse. David maintained that he did not recall the question on abuse but said he had responded to every question honestly. Following David’s interviews, prosecutors requested that Nathan investigate his statements; Maxwell’s lawyers swiftly asked for a hearing and new trial. In their request for a new trial, which was also unsealed Thursday, with redactions, Maxwell’s lawyers said: “The sixth amendment to the United States constitution guarantees trial by jury. Fundamental to that guarantee is the promise that the jury will be comprised of twelve dispassionate individuals who will fairly and impartially decide, based on the evidence or lack of evidence and not on their personal predilections and biases, whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.” They wrote: “Voir dire plays an essential role in this process, and it depends on potential jurors to truthfully answer material questions put to them by the court and the parties. That did not happen here. Juror No 50 did not truthfully respond to perhaps the most important question put to potential jurors about their personal experiences – a question that pertained directly to the core allegations against Ms Maxwell: whether they had been a victim of sexual assault or abuse.” “Juror No 50’s false answer undermined voir dire, resulted in a jury that was not fair and impartial, and deprived Ms Maxwell of her constitutional right to trial by jury.” In an email, when asked about Nathan’s decision, David’s attorney said: “No comment.”",News/US news,Ghislaine Maxwell juror to be quizzed in court as lawyers push for retrial,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-juror-50-court-hearing
2/25/2022,"From his home in Key West, Florida, Billy Connolly describes what he used to get up to after a standup gig had finished. He would continue on into the night, and “find some tavern where people were happy to listen to a tale or two”. Billy Connolly Does ... (Gold) is just that: prodded by his long-time director Mike Reilly, he reminisces about the past, telling tales gathered together on a certain theme, illustrated by a pacy mix of animation, library clips and archive footage. Sometimes these hybrid compilation/interview shows work well – French and Saunders did a great one on women in comedy last year – and sometimes they feel like a long-expired rock band repackaging their greatest hits for the ninth time. Connolly is such a charmer that this one works beautifully. Subsequent episodes will cover fatherhood, marriage and home, but the theme tonight is bad behaviour, which shows off Connolly at his most raucous, and allows for a spot of profound reflection at the end.  Reilly explains that he has made this show because he has worked with Connolly for 10 years, and all anyone wants to know from him is: “What’s Billy Connolly like?” His answer? “He’s everything you want him to be.” Connolly retired from standup in 2018, having been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2013, but after 50 years of shows, there is plenty of material to look back on. What’s striking is how familiar much of it is, how woven into the fabric of British comedy culture his work has been. Bad behaviour is a great topic because it gives him free rein to cover all the naughty stuff. He talks about getting sidetracked by lesbian bus drivers in Wellington, New Zealand, and about the appeal of pubs and bars. He does his famous “drunk walks” bit, riffs about life on tour and the shenanigans that bored and overindulged people are likely to get up to. Being on tour is the whole world for people in the thick of it, although it’s usually of little interest to anyone who isn’t. Few can spin gold out of an environment that is notoriously monotonous; that Connolly is an exception to this rule just proves his greatness. The anecdotes are criminally entertaining, though I am not sure how necessary the animations are: just hearing him describe a trifle down the trousers is enough. Michael Parkinson recalls a wild night out with Connolly in Sydney, when the comedian appeared to be drunkenly goading police to arrest him, in the middle of the road. Parkinson says it was his job to get Connolly back to the hotel before he was locked up, but Connolly only agreed to go with him if they danced all the way back. “Billy in the wild days,” as Parkinson puts it, warmly, seemed like a limitless adventure. The wild days did not last, of course. His wife appears in this first episode via “Pam-Cam”, providing biscuits, and Connolly recalls the time she told him she did not want to be with a drunk, and so he stopped drinking. The discussion about that is almost a match for the peerless comedy clips from across the ages. “People don’t mind if you give up drinking so long as you buy your round,” he jokes, before offering up an honest consideration of the role alcohol played in his career. He was worried that without it, he would not be the man he was, but he reasons that in the end it is “pretendy wildness”, and that he knows how to turn it on, with or without the drink. Pretendy wildness, real wildness: all life is here, and it all amuses him greatly. Amid the nostalgia, there is time for reflection, and plenty of the memories are as moving as they are funny. Many of the people Connolly speaks of are now dead. He reminisces about a silly hotel game invented by his old soundman, Malcolm Kingsnorth, who spent 10 years on the road with Status Quo before moving to Connolly’s tour. The days of comedians as rock stars, so intertwined that they could share a stage together, as Connolly did with Led Zeppelin, are a relic of another age, but it’s fun to remember him as the first rock star comedian. He recalls a night out with John Hurt and Keith Moon, with whom he clicked instantly, and anticipated a long and fruitful friendship. But Moon died before they could meet again. “I was really looking forward to having him as a friend,” says Connolly, sadly, before letting us in on what he did for his own, small personal tribute. I’ll admit that I had a lump in my throat, but the real pleasure here, I think, is that Connolly had a twinkle in his eye.",Arts/Television & radio,Billy Connolly Does ... review – criminally entertaining yarns from the Big Yin,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/24/billy-connolly-does-review-criminally-entertaining-yarns-from-the-big-yin
2/25/2022,"Courtney Lawes has described the recent injury problems that left him with persistent headaches and affected vision caused by “headrush”, having been restored to the England captaincy for Saturday’s key Six Nations clash against Wales. Lawes has been cleared to make his first appearance in six weeks at Twickenham this weekend, having been sidelined with a head injury since Northampton’s European Cup defeat by Ulster on 16 January. After arriving into camp with England later that month Lawes had a scan and visited a specialist who identified that the problem was with his vestibular system, or in his own words, “the connection between your eyes, ears and neck”, which had been “rattled”.  Jones believes Lawes will hit the ground running against Wales, describing his captain as someone who “tends to play pretty well fresh on to the paddock” and the Northampton loose forward, renowned for his tough tackling, is adamant he has no concerns over jumping back in at the deep end. Lawes – who was cleared to return to full training last Friday – painted a candid picture of his symptoms over the past month and a half, however. “I guess pretty much the day after [the Ulster match] I had headaches which didn’t go away for a little while,” said the 33-year-old. “I also had headrush-like symptoms. It was explained to me that with the vestibular system you get headaches because the connection’s been rattled and your brain is having to compensate. Maybe your neck doesn’t think your head is in the position it is. “When your brain has to compensate for that you get things like headaches and trouble with the eyes, which is why I was getting headrush or those kinds of symptoms. It was all explained quite well so I knew exactly what was going on. It gave me a bit of peace of mind. It wasn’t in one particular game. I had just taken a couple of little knocks the past month or two or so. I was a little worried, obviously because it is to do with your head, but I came into camp and we got a scan and saw a specialist and he said it was nothing to do with my brain which was a massive relief. We have been going pretty hard this week [in training] and I have come through it fine, I am pretty confident.” England v Wales teams, 4.45pm GMT kick-off, Saturday 26 February England (TBC): Steward; Malins, Slade, ????, Nowell; Smith, Randall; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Sinckler, Ewels, Itoje, Lawes (capt), Curry, Dombrandt.

Replacements: Lake, G Thomas, Brown, S Davies, Morgan, Hardy, Anscombe, J Davies. Tom Curry captained England in the defeat by Scotland and the victory over Italy but Jones revealed it was always the plan to turn to Lawes once he had recovered. Lawes proved a popular captain for the autumn victories over Tonga and South Africa, with 90 caps he brings considerable experience to a game England must win if they are to keep alive any realistic hopes of winning the title, and a lightness of touch around the dressing room. Jones conceded that Ben Youngs was “not happy” to be named only on the bench as he prepares to break Jason Leonard’s all-time England caps record but Lawes believes the current England squad has a more compassionate side than in years gone by. Asked if that was the case, he said: “I’d say so, yeah, definitely. The motivation now is to play for each other and we really do have that nailed on now. We commit to everything we do in the week, we buy into each other and therefore we owe it to each other to turn up on the weekend. “Obviously [Ben] will be disappointed, he won’t show it. He’s still going to give everything he can to the team and that’s credit to himself and the team, because I would expect every one of the players to be disappointed, definitely, but to still contribute to the efforts at the weekend.”",Sport/Sport,Courtney Lawes ready to lead England against Wales after head injury all-clear,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/24/england-wales-rugby-union-six-nations-courtney-lawes
2/25/2022,"There would seem no immediate link, at first glance, between the quicksilver Harry Randall, England’s starting scrum-half against Wales, and Jack Leach, the bespectacled Somerset and England left-arm spinner. In the constantly whirring mind of Eddie Jones, though, a significant connection exists which is set to shape the outcome of Saturday’s pivotal Six Nations fixture at Twickenham. As an avid cricket fan Jones took his usual keen interest in the recent Ashes series, not least the calculated way in which Australia sought to hit Leach out of the attack early in the series at The Gabba. This week Jones has dug out those clips again to illustrate to his squad the importance of meticulous, smart preparation and the effect it can have on major sporting outcomes.  The point was less about Australia’s plethora of left-handers deliberately trying to dent Leach’s confidence – which they successfully achieved – and more the broader importance of having a plan in place at international level. “That didn’t happen by chance,” said Jones, having announced perhaps the best balanced England starting XV available to him. “That was a plan by the Australian team’s leadership to get Leach out of the attack. They didn’t want him in there and they wanted to make sure England’s four medium pacers had to keep bowling.” Which is a not dissimilar rationale to the one Jones has applied to his selection this week, prior to the hammer blow of Manu Tuilagi’s hamstring strain which has now ruled him out of contention. His analysis of Wales has reinforced his view of a team who are tough to put away in tight games, as shown by a series of close contests in recent times and again against Scotland in Cardiff last week. The Jones plan, therefore, is to rush out and grasp the early initiative via a combination of pace, power and purpose. Hence the choice of Randall ahead of Ben Youngs, who must now wait to overhaul Jason Leonard’s record as England’s most-capped player from the bench. Randall is nothing if not rapid and England’s second-half go-slow against Italy in Rome with Youngs on the pitch has also trumped any sentimental feelings. The layers of tactical nuance, though, do not end there. England are already well aware of Wales’s preference for keeping the ball infield against them rather than supplying them with plenty of lineout possession from which they so often build. The aerial skills of Dan Biggar and Liam Williams are further incentives to hoist the ball skywards and seek to compete, with a hard-working defence in support. Factor in Jones’s belief that the first 20 minutes are an increasingly prime time to attack in the modern game and the head coach believes supporters would be wise to take their seats early. “You generally find that, if you can get some good quality ball early, the defences are not as quickly set,” confirmed Jones. “The first 20 minutes of a Test match is always the quickest. I think the stat is that 78% of teams who score the first try win the Test, so it is really important for us to have a fast start. We have to get out of the blocks pretty quickly.” And if that fails, Jones also has Plan B waiting. Modern stats indicate a tendency for more lineouts to occur late in games, for which Jamie George’s throwing accuracy is perfectly suited. It leaves Luke Cowan-Dickie to roar from the start alongside the equally rumbustious Ellis Genge, with Joe Marler on hand to inject extra second-half scrummaging oomph if needed. Youngs, while disappointed not to be starting, is also no stranger to last-quarter pressure while Elliot Daly has been a late thorn in Welsh sides in the past. Much time and effort, furthermore, continues to be spent on enhancing England’s leadership depth, with Simon Scott, a former Royal Marines officer and corporate leadership consultant, and the former national captain Will Carling helping to improve both communication and the squad’s operational structure. England v Wales teams, 4.45pm GMT kick-off, Saturday 26 February England (TBC): Steward; Malins, Slade, ????, Nowell; Smith, Randall; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Sinckler, Ewels, Itoje, Lawes (capt), Curry, Dombrandt. Replacements: George, Marler, Stuart, Isiekwe, Simmonds, Youngs, Ford, Daly. Wales: L Williams; Cuthbert, Watkin, Tompkins, Adams; Biggar (capt), T Williams; W Jones, Elias, Francis, Rowlands, Beard, Moriarty, Basham, Faletau. Replacements: Lake, G Thomas, Brown, S Davies, Morgan, Hardy, Anscombe, J Davies. The upshot, slightly counter-intuitively, is that England now boast no fewer than four official vice captains supporting Courtney Lawes – Tom Curry, Henry Slade, Genge and Cowan-Dickie – with the Owen Farrell-George Ford decision-making axis no longer holding the balance of power. Where precisely that will leave Farrell when he is back from injury remains an interesting question but the more collegiate approach encouraged by Scott appears to suit all concerned. “Simon brings a very modern perspective of leadership to help create an environment where the players can grow,” explained Jones. “He’s a corporate guy who loves his rugby. Communication is one thing [but] it’s about being intentional in your planning. Nothing ever happens unless you plan it.” On the aforementioned Scott’s website his personal mantra sounds simple enough: to help “ordinary people to achieve extraordinary performance over and over again through deliberate, rigorous, quality practice – and to stay cheerful, even in adversity”. England have endured a touch of the latter in this championship so far but, if they win well this weekend, their title destiny will still be very much in their own hands.

2/25/2022,"Joe Biden on Thursday announced a fresh round of what he said would be crippling sanctions on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, declaring that Vladimir Putin “chose this war” and that he and his country will bear the consequences. The sanctions target Russia’s largest banks and companies, cutting them off from western financial markets, while imposing export controls and sanctioning Russian oligarchs and their families.  “Putin is the aggressor. Putin chose this war,” the US president said. “And now he and his country will bear the consequences.” Part of a coordinated response with allies and partners, Biden said the measures taken by the US and allied nations around the world were meant to “maximize a long-term impact” on Russia, extracting severe costs on Moscow immediately and over time for what Biden called its “brutal assault” on a sovereign nation. Biden warned that Putin’s “desire for empire” extended beyond Ukraine, saying the Russian leader sought to re-create the former Soviet Union. But the president was emphatic in his vow that US troops would not engage Russia in Ukraine, but he again affirmed the US would defend “every inch of Nato territory”. The commitment was underscored by an announcement that Biden had authorized the deployment of additional US troops to Germany as part of Nato’s response. As Biden addressed the nation from the East Room of the White House, the Ukrainian government reported mounting casualties as Russian troops unleashed a punishing offensive on the nation, advancing on the nation’s capital, Kyiv. Biden’s remarks came hours after he held a virtual meeting with the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy and Japan. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, European Council president Charles Michel, and Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg were also in attendance. Earlier on Thursday, he convened a meeting of the US national security council. The penalties come a day after the White House unveiled an initial “tranche” of sanctions in response to Putin’s recognition of two breakaway republics in east Ukraine. The sanctions announced on Thursday aim to further destabilize Russia’s financial system while starving the country of technology critical to its economy and military. The US Treasury said the latest round of sanctions against Russia would impact nearly 80% of all banking assets in the country, fundamentally threatening the Russian economy and weakening the Kremlin’s geopolitical posture. “Treasury is taking serious and unprecedented action to deliver swift and severe consequences to the Kremlin and significantly impair their ability to use the Russian economy and financial system to further their malign activity,” said Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary. Biden said the purpose of the sanctions was to limit “Russia’s ability to do business in dollars, euros, pounds and yen to be part of the global economy”. But they are not as forceful as some elected officials in the US and Ukraine have called for, steps that would include removing Russia from the Swift international banking system and targeting Russia’s energy sector or leveling sanctions against Putin personally. “We demand the disconnection of Russia from Swift, the introduction of a no-fly zone over Ukraine and other effective steps to stop the aggressor,” the Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a tweet. On Thursday, congressman Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, called on the US to “dramatically escalate” its response to Moscow and endorsed calls to remove Russia from the international banking system and its ability to access western capital. Biden argued that time was needed to the current round of sanctions to take their desired effect, and said the US was “prepared” to impose more severe penalties on Russia. The president defended his administration’s response. For several weeks, the US has declassified and made public Putin’s secret plans, while moving quickly to blame Russia for a series of cyber-attacks against Ukrainian banks and agencies. The purpose of the approach was to expose the Kremlin’s justification for war as baseless, he said. “Now, it’s unfolding largely as we predicted,” the president said. Asked by reporters whether he was consulting China to isolate Russia, Biden would not comment. He also said he was working to persuade India to join the western-led push against Russia. Biden said he had no plans to talk to Putin. The US president also urged resolve among the American people, who he said would likely face economic consequences as a result of what Biden called Putin’s “naked aggression”. The US has also warned government agencies and operators of critical infrastructure to take pre-emptive actions to safeguard against a potential Russian cyber-attack. In a stark contrast to Donald Trump, who has repeatedly assailed Biden while badly mangling the facts surrounding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Barack Obama called on “every American, regardless of party” to support the president’s efforts to punish the Kremlin. Echoing Biden, Obama acknowledged that there would likely be economic consequences for Americans, but that it was a “price we should be willing to pay to take a stand on the side of freedom”. As Biden has warned throughout his presidency, he said democracies around the world were being tested and threatened by Putin’s “sinister vision for the future of our world”. He said there was never a question that the US would respond to Russia’s assault on Ukraine. “This aggression cannot go unanswered,” Biden said. “America stands up to bullies. We stand up for freedom. This is who we are.”",News/US news,Biden imposes new sanctions on Russia: ‘America stands up to bullies’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/joe-biden-us-russia-sanctions-ukraine
2/25/2022,"Ron DeSantis, the right-wing Republican governor of Florida, has fueled speculation about a future US presidential run with a high profile speech lambasting Joe Biden, the media and what he termed “wokeism”. DeSantis, who is both an ally and possible rival to Donald Trump, delivered the attack at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the biggest annual gathering of grassroots conservatives in the US.  The governor was speaking in Orlando in his home state, but the broad and national sweep of his address, which did not mention Trump by name, was consistent with eyeing a potential White House run in 2024 or 2028. “I can tell you there’s one fellow that just hates Florida: his name is Joe Biden,” said DeSantis, setting himself up as the voice of opposition to the incumbent US president, whose name elicited boos in the cavernous ballroom. “Always trying to take pot shots at Florida and he does things like take our medication. He stiffs storm victims of relief just because he doesn’t like the governor. He doesn’t like Florida. He doesn’t like me because we stand up to him.” The crowd cheered and applauded DeSantis, 43, who went on to rail against Biden over border security, crime and the economy. “The inflation is because of his policies and we’re not going to let anyone forget that. So all told, he’s had the worst first year of any president since the 1800s. “And as Biden flounders, Florida is leading on issue after issue ... We are in the process of getting money from the legislature so that if Biden is dumping illegal aliens into Florida from the southern border, I’m rerouting them to Delaware. We’ll do some in DC and Hollywood as well.” The reference to Biden’s home state was a populist crowd pleaser – it produced a resounding roar of approval – that Trump himself would have envied. Indeed, DeSantis’s speech was a model of Fox News talking points that mocked “lockdown” politicians for holidaying in Florida, which he declared the least restrictive state in the nation during the coronavirus pandemic. In an attack on Biden’s chief medical adviser, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci, DeSantis declared: “From the very beginning, we refused to let this state descend into some type of Faucian dystopia where people’s freedoms are curtailed and their livelihoods are destroyed ... Florida has defeated Faucism. Freedom has prevailed in the sunshine state.” He added: “I really believe had Florida not led the way, this country could look like Canada or Australia.” Florida is such a bastion of freedom, he claimed, that people are settling there as they flee from “leftist governments” in America and around the world. The slogan at this year’s CPAC, where Trump is due to speak on Saturday, is “Awake not woke”. DeSantis tapped into the resentments of the audience – some of whom wore “DeSantisLand” caps and flags – by launching a broadside at so-called “woke culture”. He boasted about banning critical race theory (CRT), an academic discipline that studies how racism is embedded in US law and institutions that, despite not taught in America’s public schools, has been caricatured and demonized by the right. “They want us to be powerless, they want us to be voiceless, they want us to be second-class citizens,” said DeSantis, who is running for reelection as governor this year, “And what are these ideological aims? The woke is the new religion of the left, and this is what they have in mind.” Many major institutions – including big tech companies – have become “infected with this woke virus”, the former Republican congressman added. “You look at the corrupt and dishonest legacy media in this country and what they’re doing to divide us and what they’re doing to prop up the regime”.",News/US news,Ron DeSantis fuels US presidential run speculation with CPAC speech,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/ron-desantis-cpac-speech-florida-joe-biden-media
2/25/2022,"Ukraine was fighting for its survival after Vladimir Putin unleashed a punishing offensive on the country that left hundreds dead or injured, and world leaders warned that Moscow had embarked on a dangerous new era of imperial expansion. The continent awoke to the shock of scenes it once believed it had left in the 20th century: helicopters strafing homes outside the capital, long lines of tanks ploughing ever deeper towards Ukraine’s heartland, roads choked with refugees, and civilians huddled in underground stations to escape bombardment.  The west scrambled to respond with a range of new sanctions against Moscow, with the US also announcing it would send 7,000 more troops to Germany to shore up Nato’s eastern borders. But even after the invasion there were divisions on the strength of the response, as Russian forces advanced undeterred by the threats. With ferocious fighting on multiple fronts, Putin’s ultimate war aims were not entirely clear, but they appeared to be ambitious. Russian airborne forces descended on a military base at Hostomel, just outside Kyiv, with the possible objective of forcing open a pathway to the capital. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken said that “all evidence suggests that Russia intends to encircle and threaten Kyiv”. “We believe Moscow has developed plans to inflict widespread human rights abuses – and potentially worse – on the Ukrainian people,” Blinken told a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Russian troops were also clearly attempting to cut off Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, with a population of nearly 1.5 million, in the east. Ukrainian authorities said one Russian column had seized control of the Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of Europe’s worst environmental disaster in 1986, and an emblem for many Ukrainians of the incompetent despotism of rule from Moscow. Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to the head of the president’s office in Kyiv, admitted it was “impossible to say” whether the site, where the remains of its radioactive reactor core lie buried, was safe. The port city of Mariupol, which lies between the two regions of Ukraine already occupied by Russia, Crimea and the Donbas in the east, was also reported to be under heavy fire. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, declared martial law and pledged that his government would arm every Ukrainian willing to defend their country. In a late-night address, he said that 137 people had died in fighting, and claimed that Russia had named him “target number one.” As Ukrainian diplomats pleaded with the world to stop the Russian aggression, Zelenskiy warned of a bleak return to the past. “What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft,” he said. “This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world. Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.” Many of Putin’s keenest observers had thought the Russian leader would hesitate before ordering an all-out land war to subjugate Ukraine because of the potentially catastrophic consequences for Russia as well as Ukraine, but he proved them wrong. While Russia was chairing an emergency session of the UN security council that was tasked with finding a way out of the crisis the Kremlin had engineered, Putin broadcast a declaration of war he had recorded three days earlier, underlining the futility of the global diplomatic efforts to dissuade him. The US and Europe sought to inflict punitive measures on his regime with the aim of ensuring that Putin’s war of choice became his worst strategic blunder, by crippling the Russian economy. “Putin’s aggression against Ukraine will end up costing Russia dearly economically and strategically,” Joe Biden warned. “We will make sure of that. Putin will be a pariah on the international stage.” Biden said he was sending 7,000 more troops to strengthen Nato’s eastern borders, expelling Russian diplomats, imposing sanctions on Russia’s two largest banks and almost 90 financial institution subsidiaries around the world. Asked if the invasion marked the start of a new cold war, Biden replied: “That depends. It’s going to be a cold day for Russia.” At the same time, the UK announced its “largest ever” set of economic sanctions on Russia, freezing assets of all major Russian banks and limiting cash held by Russian nationals in UK banks and sanctioning more than 100 individuals and entities. However, clear divisions remained among western countries, with the US and European allies concerned about the global economic ramifications of some of the stronger sanctions. Biden admitted for example that exclusion from the Swift global electronic transactions system was not in the present package of sanctions. It was not, Biden said, the “position that the rest of Europe wishes to take”. Nor did the sanctions announced on Thursday include restrictions on Putin himself. The omission of Swift sanctions enraged the Kyiv government. The foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said that those opposing the move had to “understand that the blood of innocent Ukrainian men, women and children will be on their hands too”. In announcing the sanctions on Thursday, Biden suggested that a wider conflict was possible, given Putin’s aspirations. “He has much larger ambitions than Ukraine. He wants to reestablish the former Soviet Union – that’s what this is about,” he said. Late on Thursday, French president Emmanuel Macron called Putin “to demand an immediate halt” to Moscow’s offensive, the Elysee Palace said. The Kremlin, meanwhile, said only that the two leaders had a “serious and frank exchange of views” about Ukraine. In his speeches, Putin has portrayed the Ukrainian government as a mortal threat to Russia, and hinted heavily at his desire for regime change. He claimed that the Kyiv government had ambitions and means to acquire nuclear weapons, and was run by Nazis – claims so outlandish that they triggered questions about the Russian leader’s mental stability. By mid-afternoon on Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems. Ukrainian authorities said Russia had carried out 203 attacks and that fighting was raging across almost the entire territory. Military sources in Ukraine said 20 Russian helicopters and Mi-8 aircraft had landed paratroopers at Hostomel airport in the Kyiv region, where forces from both sides were fighting for control. They said Ukrainian forces had killed 50 Russian troops, destroyed four Russian tanks, and downed six Russian planes and four helicopters. Zelenskiy also said Ukrainian forces were fighting to prevent Russian troops capturing the former nuclear power plant at Chernobyl. The early hours of the invasion appeared to have claimed dozens of civilian lives in Ukraine. According to the authorities, 18 people were killed in a missile attack in the southern Odessa region, six people were killed in the town of Brovary, near Kyiv, and four people were killed and 10 injured after an “occupier’s shell” hit a hospital in the city of Vuhledar in Donetsk. Air raid sirens sounded in Ukraine’s major cities, and civilians in Kyiv and Kharkiv sheltered in the cities’s metro stations – scenes that have not been seen in those cities since 1941. Kuleba urged the world to wake up. “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine,” he said “Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes. This is a war of aggression. Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.”",News/World news,Ukraine fights for its survival as Putin presses forward,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/ukraine-fights-for-its-survival-as-putin-presses-forward
2/25/2022,"It was in early November that US president Joe Biden took the rare step to dispatch CIA director Bill Burns to Moscow. The spy chief’s message – in part – was to warn his Kremlin counterparts that the West was concerned about unusual troop movements it was seeing near Ukraine’s border.  British officials were anxious, too. “We keep on coming back to crises over Ukraine,” one said later that month. “President Biden does not send Bill Burns to Moscow unless he is very worried about something. And so, you know, without being able to go into the full details, there is enough substance to this to make us concerned.” A few days later, in early December, the Washington Post reported that US intelligence had found that the Kremlin was “planning a multi-front offensive as soon as early next year involving up to 175,000 troops”, from the north, east and south. The intelligence warnings continued into January, increasingly to the irritation of Kyiv, whose president Volodymyr Zelenskiy complained that acute tensions with Russia were nothing new. “We have been in the situation for eight years,” he said at the time, referring to the start of the 2014 war with Russian-backed separatists. At the time, some were considered outlandish. Britain warned that Russia was contemplating a coup plot, involving four exiled politicians, while the US said plans were afoot to create a pretext for an invasion using a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack. It turned out that Russia did try to create false pretexts, but with none of the production values – or credibility – the US warning implied. The debacle of the buildup to the war in Iraq, where claims of weapons of mass destruction turned out to be baseless, has hung over US and UK agencies for two decades. This time, unfortunately, their warnings about Vladimir Putin’s intentions have proved uncannily accurate.",News/US news,US and UK intelligence warnings vindicated by Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/us-uk-intelligence-russian-invasion-ukraine
2/25/2022,"England have been dealt a colossal blow before Saturday’s crunch Six Nations match against Wales with Manu Tuilagi ruled out by a hamstring injury – just hours after he was recalled to the side by Eddie Jones. Tuilagi was in line for his first England appearance since November, as well as a first Six Nations start for two years, but Jones’s plans have now been ruined after the centre’s injury curse continued.  Joe Marchant has been summoned to join the squad but Jones will not finalise his team until hours before kick-off on Saturday with Elliot Daly another option to come into the centres. Either way, Tuilagi’s absence creates a monumental headache for Jones and little time to resolve it as England seek to keep their Six Nations title hopes alive against Wales. During training on Thursday afternoon Tuilagi suffered a low grade tear to the same hamstring he injured in the first 10 minutes against South Africa, in the process of scoring the opening try, and a subsequent scan confirmed the extent of the injury. Though England hope the 30-year-old will return before the end of the Six Nations, his absence on Saturday is a devastating setback. Jones had enthused about the unique threat of Tuilagi, and over the prospect of seeing a 10-12-13 axis with Marcus Smith and Henry Slade on either side of the Sale centre. Now the head coach must decide whether to put Marchant straight back into the side after he was released back to Harlequins earlier in the week, or opt for the versatile Daly instead. England’s attacking plan requires major surgery regardless. England v Wales teams, 4.45pm GMT kick-off, Saturday 26 February England (TBC): Steward; Malins, Slade, ????, Nowell; Smith, Randall; Genge, Cowan-Dickie, Sinckler, Ewels, Itoje, Lawes (capt), Curry, Dombrandt. Replacements: George, Marler, Stuart, Isiekwe, Simmonds, Youngs, Ford, Daly. Wales: L Williams; Cuthbert, Watkin, Tompkins, Adams; Biggar (capt), T Williams; W Jones, Elias, Francis, Rowlands, Beard, Moriarty, Basham, Faletau. Replacements: Lake, G Thomas, Brown, S Davies, Morgan, Hardy, Anscombe, J Davies. “Manu is a gain-line accumulator isn’t he,” Jones had said. “He wins the gain line consistently, draws defenders in which creates space for other options. He does that better than anyone else in the world when he’s at full tilt.” Jones did, however, ­acknowledge that while Tuilagi is, in effect, ­irreplaceable, England have often had to cope with his absence. Since Jones took over in 2016, Tuilagi has been available for just 50 of 71 matches prior to Saturday’s clash but such is his value, England have not lost at Twickenham for 10 years when he has been in the side. “The only thing I know is that he gives us a lot of confidence because he has that physical power and when he plays the players feed off that,” added Jones. “But also we’ve learned to play without him. We’ve played most of the last two years without Manu. But when he’s there we intend to use his power and if he’s not there we find another way to manufacture power.” His latest blow will also be keenly felt among the rest of the squad given his popularity among his peers. Ellis Genge, formerly a teammate at Leicester Tigers, said earlier this week: “Besides being a world-class player he is a world-class teammate. He is probably one of them you would think because of his genetics he doesn’t do the graft off the pitch. But he is relentless with his recovery.” Jones has handed the returning Courtney Lawes the captaincy but left Ben Youngs – is in line for his record-breaking 115th cap – on the bench with Harry Randall continuing at scrum-half. Lawes comes straight back into the side at blindside flanker, having been sidelined with a head injury since mid-January, and takes back the captaincy from Tom Curry. Randall impressed against Italy last time out, making only his third start, and his fledgling partnership with Smith has evidently impressed Jones. His selection is a signal of intent given the tempo that Randall brings with Youngs now poised to surpass Jason Leonard’s caps record from the bench. Max Malins and Jack Nowell are on the wings and Freddie Steward continues at full back. In the pack, Alex Dombrandt keeps his place at No 8 ahead of Sam Simmonds while Maro Itoje returns to the second row where he joins Charlie Ewels. Genge and Luke Cowan-Dickie – both been named among the four vice-captains – are alongside Kyle Sinckler, who makes his 50th appearance, in the front row. Slade and Curry are the other two deputies while Joe Marler, Jamie George, Will Stuart, Nick Isiekwe, George Ford and Elliot Daly join Simmonds and Youngs on the bench.",Sport/Sport,Manu Tuilagi’s latest hamstring injury hits England’s plans for crunch Wales tie,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/24/england-harry-randall-ben-youngs-six-nations-wales-twickenham-rugby-union

2/25/2022,"Actor Sean Penn is on the ground in Ukraine making a documentary about the Russian invasion, Vice Studios confirmed to Variety on Thursday, as Russia began a full-scale attack on its neighbor. The Oscar-winning star and longtime humanitarian activist appeared at a press briefing by the Ukrainian government in Kyiv on Thursday, listening to government officials speak about the crisis many world leaders are calling the worst conflict in Europe since 1945.  Penn previously visited Ukraine in November 2021 to research for the film. His visits with the Ukrainian military were documented by the Ukrainian joint forces operation press service, which posted photos of the meetups on social media at the time. According to Newsweek, Penn arrived in Kyiv earlier this week and met with deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, as well as local journalists and members of the military. The office of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a statement through the Ukrainian embassy in praise of the actor and director, who “specially came to Kyiv to record all the events that are currently happening in Ukraine and to tell the world the truth about Russia’s invasion of our country”. “Sean Penn is among those who support Ukraine in Ukraine today. Our country is grateful to him for such a show of courage and honesty,” the translated statement read. The statement also said Penn “is demonstrating bravery that many others have been lacking, in particular some Western politicians. The more people like that – true friends of Ukraine, who support the fight for freedom – the quicker we can stop this heinous invasion by Russia”. This is not the first time Penn has put himself in the center of a crisis. The 61-year-old actor directed the 2020 Discovery Plus documentary Citizen Penn, about the process of establishing his non-profit Community Organized Relief Effort, or Core, in the wake the devastating earthquakes in Haiti in 2010. Core also helped deploy teams for Covid-19 testing and vaccination during the pandemic. In January 2016, Penn published an exclusive – and highly controversial – interview with Mexican drug kingpin Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán in Rolling Stone; Penn’s covert journey to visit with the Sinaloan cartel leader, who escaped from prison in 2015, contributed to his arrest by Mexican authorities. Penn later said he had “terrible regret” that his interview and 10,000-word article did not achieve its true purpose of changing the conversation about the war on drugs.",Arts/Film,Sean Penn in Ukraine to film documentary on Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/24/sean-penn-ukraine-documentary-russian-invasion
2/25/2022,"News of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shaken members of Canada’s Ukrainian community, the largest diaspora population outside of Ukraine and Russia. “I have a knot in my stomach. I can only imagine what it’s like for people in Ukraine who are living with the shelling,” said Taras Kulish, a Toronto-based charity lawyer and member of the Ukrainian Canadian Congress. “We’re all concerned and there’s a definitely a shock factor in processing it.”  Announcing new sanctions on key Russian figures, Justin Trudeau on Thursday condemned the “horrific, unprovoked attack” on Ukraine. “We stand united and steadfast in our support of Ukraine’s sovereignty,” the prime minister said. “And we stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people’s right to decide their own future in a free and democratic state.” Canada’s sanctions will target wealthy Russians, large banks and members of the Russian security council, including the defence minister, the finance minister and the justice minister. Canada will also halt export permits to the country. The deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, who is of Ukrainian descent, said Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine placed him in the ranks of the “reviled European dictators” who caused mass death and carnage in the 20th century. At times speaking in Ukrainian, Freedland also called on fellow members of the Ukranian Canadian community to show strength and to support loved ones affected by the war. “The Ukrainian people, like all people, must be free to determine their own future,” she said. “We know that the people of Ukraine … are fighting for us too. They are fighting for democracy and we stand with them.” Canada’s new sanctions comes after it previously pledged C$500m (US$780,770) in financial support Ukraine C$7.8m worth of lethal equipment and ammunition. For Ukrainian Canadians, news of the invasion has been devastating. A number of organizations across Canada are quickly raising funds for relief projects, organizing rallies and assisting those with families affected by the war. The prairie province of Alberta announced it would donate C$1m to the Ukrainian Canadian Congress, a recognition of the large diaspora population in the region– and the long history Ukrainian residents have farming the area. Kulish, who works closely with humanitarian organizations in Ukraine, says colleagues on the ground have described the surreal experience of shelling near their homes and the constant worry of loved ones. “I’ve been checking in with colleagues telling them we’re here. We’re praying for you. We’re looking to see what we can do in response. We’re trying to give them that knowledge that people are concerned about them and who love them,” said Kulish. “But you can’t imagine what it’s like. It’s almost unfathomable.” For the last eight years, Kulish has been involved in work providing trauma therapy clinic’s in the country’s eastern region. “We’ve been living this for the last seven years, so in one way, we’re terribly prepared for it.”",News/World news,‘A knot in my stomach’: Canada’s Ukrainian community shaken by Russia invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/canada-ukrainian-community-russia-invasion
2/25/2022,"Minutes after Vladimir Putin ended weeks of agonised speculation by announcing a “special military operation” at dawn on Thursday, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. According to Ukrainian officials, the initial wave of strikes appeared to involve cruise missiles, artillery and airstrikes, which struck military infrastructure and border positions, including airbases. Russian troops have entered the country from the north, east and south, seemingly targeting the capital, Kyiv and the cities of Kharkiv and Kherson respectively. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, responded to the invasion by declaring martial law and saying Kyiv would issue weapons to every Ukrainian who wanted to defend their country. As Ukrainian diplomats pleaded with the world to stop the Russian aggression, Zelenskiy warned of a bleak return to the past. By mid-afternoon on Thursday, Russia’s defence ministry claimed to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems. Ukrainian authorities said Russia had carried out 203 attacks and that fighting was raging across almost the entire territory.  Thousands of Ukrainians are already on the move and leaving the country, with tens of thousands more preparing to flee, after the Russian attack ordered by Vladimir Putin. Videos and photos on social media show lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west, as well as an increase of people on foot near the southern and western borders. Joe Biden ordered broad new sanctions targeting four Russian banks, oligarchs and high-tech sectors. The US president also said 7,000 additional troops would be deployed to Germany. “Putin is the aggressor,” Biden said. “Putin chose this war, and now he and his country will bear the consequences.” The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, announced the “largest ever” set of economic sanctions on Russia, including pushing to end Russia’s use of the Swift international payment systems, freezing assets of all major Russian banks, limiting cash held by Russian nationals in UK banks, and sanctioning more than 100 individuals and entities. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, voiced his anger as EU heads of state and government appeared to hold back from imposing the potentially most damaging sanction on Russia. With casualties mounting, Kuleba warned that European and US politicians would have “blood on their hands” if they decided against blocking Russia from the Swift system, through which it receives foreign currency.",News/World news,Russia has invaded Ukraine: what we know so far,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/russia-has-invaded-ukraine-what-we-know-so-far
2/25/2022,"The clues had all been there. The buildup of troops on the Ukrainian border. The increasingly bizarre, stage-managed television appearances of Vladimir Putin. The movement of troops into the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Yet still there was a belief that diplomacy and reason could somehow win through and that Russia would pull back from all-out war. That hope died early on Thursday morning when Putin launched a ground, sea and air offensive on several Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. Just after midday, Boris Johnson delivered his own televised statement from behind a small table hastily positioned in front of a doorway in Downing Street. Presumably his office was too much of a tip for him to be filmed there. There was an early reference to Neville Chamberlain, who in a 1938 radio address had described the dispute over the Sudetenland as “a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing”. Johnson stressed that Ukraine was neither far away nor a country of which we know nothing. But otherwise there was little of the Churchill tribute act that has characterised his recent Commons appearances.  Instead we got something more restrained. More hesitant, even. As if even he couldn’t quite believe it had come to this and was uncertain of what steps to take beyond a vague aspiration to defeat Putin. He talked the talk. Bodies – not ours – would mount up and Russia would be hit with massive sanctions. Yet there was a dissonance. A disconnection. It was almost as if he was aware that these were desperately serious times and he needed a different persona to his naturally glib self. Yet he couldn’t conjure one that was entirely convincing. Johnson did rather better when he faced the Commons to make a statement on Ukraine in the afternoon. Possibly because he had had a quick lesson in statesmanship from a crisis management expert, though more likely because he had accepted a few home truths. This was one of the few occasions when it didn’t matter that most of the country didn’t rate him at all and believed his first instinct was always to protect himself. In a straight fight with a delusional, narcissistic dictator who had just invaded another country and had blood on his hands, the UK’s very own narcissist was going to win hands down. Put simply, Putin was in a totally different league of sociopath. So Johnson only had to stand up to look good. It also helped that this time, Boris actually had something substantial to say. On Tuesday, he had talked a good line about Ukraine’s independence and democratic freedoms, only to come up with a list of sanctions that were about as effective as pissing in the wind: five small banks and three individuals who had already been sanctioned by the US back in 2018. At the time, the Suspect had tried to make out that this was part of a carefully gradated response, but he had clearly been taken aback when almost the entire house – the Lib Dems had been the most hawkish of the lot – thought the government was useless and it was only a matter of time before Putin invaded the rest of Ukraine. After he had recovered from nearly dying of laughter. Johnson wasn’t going to make the same mistake twice. So he followed up his tough words on Putin with equally tough sanctions. Dozens of companies and individuals would have their assets frozen – possibly even some that had donated to the Tory party, though that wasn’t made entirely clear. He also made it clear that the UK had been pushing the EU and other Nato countries to block Russia from the Swift international money transfer system – something the EU and the US were so far reluctant to do. Maybe if things got worse … The Suspect was for once ahead of the curve. He promised to bring forward the economic crime bill to next Monday, having promised it some time in the next session earlier in the week. He also hinted that the sanctions would hit UK citizens’ cost of living. For someone pathologically averse to telling people things they don’t want to hear, this was a huge step forward. Though not one necessarily to be repeated. Keir Starmer was also in his comfort zone, relishing the chance to show that Labour could be trusted in matters of defence and security. So much so that he had threatened to withdraw the whip from the 11 of his MPs unless they took their names off the Stop the War statement they had signed. He too condemned Putin and promised to back all the sanctions. And any others Johnson happened to want to bring in at a later date. You couldn’t put a cigarette paper between Starmer and Johnson, and much of the rest of the session developed into a love-in, with everyone falling over themselves to agree with one another in their determination to defeat Russia. Occasionally someone would seek clarification that people or businesses hadn’t been left off the sanction list, and the Suspect duly wrote down their names and added them to it. Even the most hawkish seemed to have decided that Nato being militarily involved was a bad idea. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, just looked glum as he sat next to Johnson. Then maybe he was still kicking himself for making a twat of himself by telling the army that he would kick Russian backsides just like in the Crimean war. Anyone for the Charge of the Light Brigade? There were only two small moments of tension. Alba MP Neale Hanvey looked disappointed he didn’t get more applause for having persuaded his leader, Alex Salmond, not to broadcast on Russia Today. And Labour’s Clive Lewis had to be reminded that the time for negotiation was generally before an invasion, not after it. But otherwise it was all sweetness and light.

2/25/2022,"Rishi Sunak has been sent a questionnaire by the Metropolitan police over his attendance at a birthday party held for Boris Johnson while tough Covid restrictions were in force. The chancellor has not yet responded but has seven days to do so, and will be able to set out why he was at the gathering in a bid to avoid being fined £100.  It comes nearly two weeks after the prime minister received a questionnaire from Scotland Yard as part of its Operation Hillman investigation into a dozen alleged parties that may have fallen foul of rules on social mixing. Sunak is understood to have attended a gathering on 19 June 2020 in the cabinet room, along with the prime minister’s wife, Carrie, the interior designer Lulu Lytle and other Downing Street staff. A cake was presented to Johnson, but ministers have sought to dismiss the significance of the event. One, the Northern Ireland minister Conor Burns, said the prime minister was “ambushed by cake”, while another, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the gathering lasted only 10 minutes. Sources close to Sunak have said he simply happened upon the celebrations, and believed it was inevitable he would receive a questionnaire given that he both works and lives in Downing Street. However, the Mirror reported earlier this month that police had obtained a photograph of Johnson holding a can of beer while standing next to Sunak. Scotland Yard has said that being handed a questionnaire is the equivalent to being interviewed under caution. All recipients of the form are asked what the purpose was of their participation in the event under scrutiny, how long they were there, who else was there and, crucially: “What, if any, lawful exemption applied to the gathering and what reasonable excuse did you have for participating in said gathering?” More than 88 questionnaires have reportedly been sent out so far, with the outgoing Met commissioner, Cressida Dick, suggesting earlier this month that “some – but probably not all – may very well end up with a fixed penalty notice”. The fine it carries is £100, though those who wish to appeal against it will see the issue referred to court. Sunak was asked several weeks ago if he was worried that the string of Downing Street parties had damaged public confidence in the government. He told the BBC: “Yes, I think it has. I can appreciate people’s frustration. And I think it’s now the job of all of us in government, all politicians, to restore people’s trust.”",News/Politics,Rishi Sunak receives Partygate questionnaire from Met police,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/rishi-sunak-receive-partygate-questionnaire-from-met-police-boris-johnson-birthday-party

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has continued with Russian forces seizing control of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and Russia’s defence ministry claiming to have “neutralised” Ukraine’s airbases and air defences, destroying 74 military ground facilities, including 11 airfields. Russian forces have attacked Ukraine on the orders of Vladimir Putin as world leaders warned that it could spark the biggest conflict in Europe since the second world war. Within minutes of Putin’s short televised address, at about 5am Ukrainian time, explosions were heard near major Ukrainian cities, including the capital, Kyiv. Ukraine’s interior ministry reported that the country was under attack from cruise and ballistic missiles, with Russia appearing to target infrastructure near major cities such as Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and Dnipro. Tens of thousands of Ukrainians were fleeing or preparing to flee the country with videos and photos on social media showing lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west. Ukraine’s president has said Kyiv would issue weapons to anyone who wanted to use them to defend the country’s sovereignty.  Western leaders have pledged far-reaching sanctions but the EU is wavering on banning Russia from Swift payment system, which is key to the movement of funds to Russia’s oil and gas sector. Meanwhile, European stock markets continued to tumble as the crisis fuelled a near-40% rise in gas price and pushed oil to $105 per barrel. The Russian central bank has bought millions of roubles to prevent the collapse of the Moscow stock exchange and prop up the currency after it plunged to an all-time low of 89.60 against the dollar. In Australia, Scott Morrison has promised “further waves of sanctions” against Russians, including hundreds of members of parliament, as he condemned Putin for the brutal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The conflict is also likely to reignite concerns about Australia’s energy security with petrol prices at the bowser already north of $1.80 and headed to $2 as the expected invasion has added to global oil price pressures. The prospect of sanctions is hurting one of Australia’s largest alumina refineries, Queensland Alumina Limited, part-owned by a Russian firm. If you are struggling to get your head across the scale of the invasion, see this visual guide to the conflict. The collapse of construction giant Probuild could be just the start of financial trouble across the Covid-ravaged industry, the construction sector’s peak body warns. Probuild, which directly employed about 750 people and had annual revenues of more than $1.4bn, was placed into voluntary liquidation by its South African owners, Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon (WBHO), late on Wednesday. Contractors and other workers turned up at sites on Thursday in several Australian cities to collect equipment, including at CSL’s $750m proposed new headquarters in Melbourne. The Northern Territory government has been condemned for a “breach of trust” after NT police confirmed that spithoods and restraint chairs remain in use, despite promises to phase out the “inhumane” devices.

In Jamal Smith’s mind sits a tableau of family he’s never really known. From memories stretched by time, he grasps at fragments of an absent father, an abusive mother, cousins he knew as siblings, and a found family of friends he fears to lose. Jamal is the protagonist of Son of Sin, the debut novel from the prime minister’s literary prize-winning poet Omar Sakr. It begins in western Sydney, where Jamal is being raised by Lebanese aunties, uncles and grandparents – the extended family of his estranged mother, Hala. Guarded by religion and propriety, they keep the past hushed, and brand Jamal as different. But from whispers, the threads of their secrets unfurl, revealing the sprawling traumas that broke them apart.

A political wedge is a tactic usually used to stir up controversy and debate with an opposing party. Over the last few weeks, the Coalition has attempted to “wedge” Labor on various policies. So why have we seen so much of it lately, and what are the risks involved in playing into this kind of cynical politics?

2/25/2022,"Russia’s attack on Ukraine began at about 5am local time, with multiple missile and air raids and a three-pronged invasion from the north, east and south that appeared to be targeting the capital, Kyiv, and the cities of Kharkiv and Kherson respectively.  As of Thursday evening, a fierce battle for the strategic airbase close to Kyiv appeared to be continuing after Russian helicopters and airborne troops attempted to establish a bridgehead outside the city. Videos on social media – among the most dramatic to have emerged since the invasion began – depicted a swarm of Russian Ka-52 and Mi8 helicopters descending on the Antonov military airfield. Ukraine said it had downed three helicopters in the initial assault, but a lunchtime report from CNN showed Russian forces in control of at least some of the base. Shortly after, however, Ukraine’s armed forces chief said Kyiv’s forces were fighting back in a critical early battle. Justin Bronk​, of the Rusi thinktank, said if airborne assault troops could take and hold the airbase, the Russians could use it to rapidly build up forces ahead of heavy ground troops to put pressure on the capital. “However, it’s high risk because until ground forces link up, the airborne assault forces are deep in Ukrainian territory and dependent on aerial resupply, casualty evacuation and fire support,” he said. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said Ukraine had lost control of the Chernobyl nuclear site in the north, where fighting raged after Russian troops crossed the border from Belarus. The adviser said authorities did not know the current condition of the facilities at the site of the world’s worst nuclear disaster. Ukraine’s interior ministry warned that if artillery fire was to hit waste stored after the 1986 disaster, it could lead to “radioactive nuclear dust” being spread “over the territory of Ukraine, Belarus and the countries of the EU”. The Chernobyl exclusion zone lies directly in the path of what western experts believe is the principal invasion route from Belarus to the west of Kyiv, where Ukraine’s presidential palace and key buildings are located. Russian troops also advanced from the north on the city of Chernihiv. One axis of advance appears to have centred around the Senkivka border crossing to the north-east of Chernihiv. Crucial, perhaps, in this calculation is the fact that south of Chernihiv – which lies to the east of the Dnieper river – lies the E95 highway to Kyiv. A substantial attack appeared aimed towards the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has a population of more than 1 million. Multiple reports from Kharkiv described explosions nearby – while Ukraine’s defence ministry said mid-morning that “fierce fights” were taking place in that area. Andriy Zagorodnyuk, Ukraine’s former defence minister, said Russian forces were trying to surround Kharkiv. “It seems like Kharkiv at the moment is the main target,” he said. Russian forces heading north into Ukraine from Crimea were not meeting any obvious resistance, at least initially. Border guards released security camera footage on Thursday showing a line of Russian military vehicles crossing into Ukraine’s government-held territory from Russian-annexed Crimea. Social media footage appeared to show Russian forces reaching the city of Kherson on the Dnieper, 80 miles (130km) inside Ukraine. Shortly after, around lunchtime, the presidential adviser said fierce fighting was taking place there. Film posted online was said to show Russian helicopters over the nearby Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant. Russian forces had also moved north-eastwards from Crimea to Melitopol, where the presidential adviser said they would meet resistance. Zagorodnyuk said: “They are quite close to the city of Kherson now. The situation is really critical there.” Air and missile strikes appear so far to be mostly focused on military targets, including an air defence site in the frontier down of Mariupol, the Ukrainian naval base in Ochakiv and an arms depot in Kalynivka, 124 miles (200km) south-west of Kyiv, according to the defence intelligence specialists Rochan Consulting. Russia’s defence ministry said its forces had destroyed 74 “objects of above-ground military infrastructure”, though this could not be confirmed. The US said it believed Russia launched 100 missiles and used 75 aircraft in the first wave of bombing. Information on casualties has been hard to verify, though on Thursday evening Ukraine’s health minister said 57 people had been killed and 169 injured. Ukraine’s armed forces earlier reported that at least 40 soldiers had died. The Ukrainian presidential adviser said up to 10 civilians had been killed. The mayor of Mariupol said three civilians had been killed there and emergency services in Kharkiv said a boy had been killed after shelling struck an apartment building. The local administration in Odesa said 22 people had died in a strike on a military base. Russia has amassed more than 150,000 combat troops on the borders of Ukraine, with a further 34,000 lightly armed separatist forces in the pro-Russian self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk. That amounts to an estimated two-thirds of Russia’s total ground forces. Half of Moscow’s air force is also deployed in the region. Ukraine’s forces are considerably smaller. It has a regular army that numbers 125,600, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, but has mobilised reserves of at least 36,000. Some of the Russian ambition has been aimed explicitly at demoralising Ukrainian civilians with the reach of the offensive. While much of the initial barrage was aimed at the east of Ukraine, so far, more sporadic strikes on cities in the west, from Uman to Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk, seem designed to demonstrate the reach of Russian weapons.",News/World news,War in Ukraine: where has Russia attacked?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/war-ukraine-kyiv-map-where-has-russia-attacked

2/25/2022,"Boris Johnson has said it is time to “squeeze Russia from the global economy, piece by piece,” as he announced a wide-ranging sanctions package against Moscow, including freezing the assets of all major Russian banks and banning hi-tech exports. “Putin will stand condemned in the eyes of the world and of history: he will never be able to cleanse the blood of Ukraine from his hands,” the prime minister told MPs as he announced the swingeing package of measures.  Pointing to sharp declines in Russian stock markets and the value of the rouble since the invasion of Ukraine, Johnson said, “we will continue on a remorseless mission to squeeze Russia from the global economy piece by piece, day by day and week by week.” He had earlier tried and failed to convince fellow G7 leaders to shut Russia out of the Swift global payments system, though his spokesperson said he would continue to press the issue in the coming days. Johnson announced 10 measures the UK was taking immediately. The assets of all major Russian banks in the UK will be frozen, including VTB, the country’s second largest bank with assets totalling £154bn. Individual sanctions will be imposed on over 120 individuals, entities and subsidiaries, including Rostec, the country’s biggest defence company, which exports £10bn in arms a year, as well as four other defence companies. Legislation is expected be tabled next week to ban major Russian companies from raising finance on UK markets and to prevent Moscow from raising sovereign debt in London. Oligarchs who will be sanctioned include Putin’s former son-in-law Kirill Shamalov, Russia’s youngest billionaire; Denis Bortnikov, the deputy chair of VTB Bank’s management board; and Yury Slyusar, the director of the United Aircraft Corporation. The Russian airline Aeroflot will be banned from landing in the UK. A diplomatic source said: “These are people who have international lifestyles. They come to Harrods to shop, they stay in our best hotels when they like, they send their children to our best public schools, and that is what’s being stopped.“So that these people are essentially persona non grata in every major western European capital in the world. That really bites.” What is it? Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38m transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars worth of deals. Who owns it? Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members. Why would a Swift ban be so serious? Boris Johnson told MPs it would harm the Russian economy if it was locked out of Swift. Run of the mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays. Why is the US reluctant to effect a ban? One reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries which have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage to the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies. The UK will suspend and prohibit all dual-use export licences to Russia, which covers items that could have civilian or military use. There will also be legislation to prohibit a wide range of hi-tech exports to Russia, including semiconductors, aircraft parts such as Rolls Royce jet engines, and oil refinery equipment. Number 10 said it would set out more detail in the coming days about new legislation to limit the deposits that all Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts to £50,000, intended to choke off the ability of Russians to raise finance and keep their money in London. The measures will also apply to Belarus, which Russian forces have used to invade Ukraine. The government will also bring forward the economic crime bill, before Easter recess, aimed at making assets more transparent. Labour leader Keir Starmer said his party would support the measures, saying the public would face “economic pain,” as a result, but “the British public have always been willing to make sacrifice to defend democracy on our continent and we will again”. Johnson had faced criticism from across the political spectrum earlier this week for introducing sanctions that many MPs, including in his own party, felt were too weak. Responding to Johnson’s statement on Thursday, former prime minister Theresa May said “every possible economic sanction” should be levied on Russia so it “absolutely feels the cold wind of isolation” and understood it had become a “pariah state”. Jeremy Hunt, the former Tory foreign secretary, said economic sanctions would not go far enough and that a “fundamental review of our military capability” was needed, as well as a revisiting of the “out of date” Integrated review of the UK’s defence policy. Some Conservative MPs called for the UK to increase military aid to Ukraine, including the former cabinet minister David Davis, who said the UK should consider providing air support to the Ukrainian armed forces. Davis said that even the most “ferocious sanctions … are no longer a deterrent, they are a punishment” and that the invasion of Ukraine meant Vladimir Putin had “effectively declared war on the west”. 1. An asset freeze on all major Russian banks, including VTB, the country’s second largest bank, which has assets of £154bn. 2. Legislation will be introduced to parliament on Tuesday that will prohibit the ability of all major Russian companies to raise finance on UK markets, and for the Russian state raise sovereign debt on UK markets. The aim is to pass the legislation in one day. 3. A set of individual sanctions on over 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries, when also counting the measures unveiled on Tuesday. The new targets include the Russian state-owned defence giant Rostec, its subsidiaries, and a group of oligarchs seen as particularly close to the Kremlin. These are: Kirill Shamalov: Russia’s youngest billionaire and Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law. Petr Fradkov: head of Promsvyazbank, one of the banks sanctioned, and the son of the former head of Russia’s FSB intelligence service. Denis Bortnikov: deputy president and chair of VTB bank. Yury Slyusar: head of Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation. Elena Georgieva: board chair of Novikombank. More people will be named in the weeks to come. The individuals will be banned from all UK transactions – meaning those with children in UK private schools will be unable to pay future fees. Relatives will not, however, be sanctioned personally. 4. Immediately ban the ability of Russian airline Aeroflot to land in the UK. 5. An immediate suspension of all dual-use export licences to Russia. This covers items that could have a civilian or military use, such as electrical components and truck parts. 6. In the coming days, legislation to prohibit a wide range of hi-tech exports, and the export of equipment connected to extracting oil and gas. This is being done in concert with the US. 7. Looking into a way to limit the amount of deposits Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts. The details have to be decided, and also whether this will cover dual nationals. 8. A plan to work with allies to shut off Russia’s access to the Swift international banking system. This would have a major impact, but can only be done effectively if other countries agree. 9. Extending the full range of sanctions to Belarus, given the integration of the nations’ military forces. 10. The UK’s economic crime bill, which will strengthen areas such as unexplained wealth orders, will be brought forward.

2/25/2022,"From Thursday, people who test positive for coronavirus are no longer required to self-isolate by law in England. Free mass testing for the general public in England will end on 1 April. The change is part of the government’s new “living with Covid” plan, announced earlier this week, which will see the end of all pandemic regulations.  Five people share their reactions below. “I wouldn’t go out if I tested positive for Covid. I’d worry about spreading it to people who could suffer dire consequences. There’s still a high death rate and a lot of people who are compromised, who haven’t got much freedom to be on public transport or in the workplace. So if I knew I had Covid, I would certainly not go out and about with it. “I have the luxury of taking that view, because my employer would accommodate it and I also have sick pay. It just worries me that other people won’t have that choice. “I think, by and large, people are trying to be decent and mutually protect each other. In a way, we’re being exhorted to drop that, but I think people will continue to do their best.” Kathy, 59, administrator, London “I’ve been shielding for two years, but think I will be returning to the office part-time in the middle of next month. I am worried about people at work testing positive. The current plan is that I will be working a good distance from everyone else at a desk right beside a large window I can open. I will probably remain masked, too. But the problem will be after April, when people won’t know if they are infected. “My greatest anxiety is about commuting on public transport and being in close contact with unmasked people. I also have to deal with members of the public in my role, but I have been assured that I will not be required to meet them face to face. My employer has been quite understanding so far and if the work from home guidance hadn’t been withdrawn then I think they would have kept me at home. Harry*, 34, working in local government, Durham, who is considered clinically extremely vulnerable “I’ve not been testing and never have. The only time was when I came back from Spain because I had to in order to travel. I want to stress that I’m not anti-vaxx, as I’ve had all my jabs. “It’s all madness. This ridiculous desire to test for Covid is insanity and has really affected people’s mental health and should’ve stopped a long time ago. If I’m unwell, whether it’s with Covid or the flu, I will just stay at home until I feel better. It’s the way I’ve done it in the past and I seem to have survived. “I know asymptomatic transmission of Covid is possible, but it seems to be very, very unlikely. The only time I would really have an issue with it is if someone came out with a streaming cold when they should be at home.” Norma, Cotswolds “I guess I would fall into the more cautious spectrum, in terms of Covid. And so, I’ve been pretty careful all the way through. I don’t think I’ve had it, and I don’t think I would want to go out if I was ill, let alone the risks to the rest of the population. “If I contracted Covid, I wouldn’t be wanting to pass it to anyone else. I wouldn’t want to pass any illness on to anyone else now we’ve gone through this. “I received an email from my work today saying that, even though the rules have changed, the company will continue to follow the guidance. That sort of sensible, head-screwed-on approach is, as I see it, the way forward for the time being until something changes. Ben, 42, Bristol, record label employee “There’s no way I would go out infecting other people, and I think everyone should be supported to make that choice. I just feel that it’s very unfair. We’re in a situation where we had children perhaps later than we would have liked, which meant we’ve been able to pay off our mortgage. We can make decisions that better protect my mother, ourselves and society. “Others aren’t in that position. Statutory sick pay is just [under] £14 a day. Testing is going to be something that people have to pay for. People aren’t going to be aware that they’re positive, and they’re not going to be able to afford to stay at home even if they want to. The message is ‘Just get on with life. It’s just like the flu.’ It’s clearly not. It’s clearly still causing a lot of damage. It just seems barbaric really.” Sarah, Nottingham, 44, teacher and stay-at-home parent *Name has been changed",News/World news,‘People won’t know if they are infected’: Britons on the end of Covid controls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/people-wont-know-if-they-are-infected-britons-on-the-end-of-covid-controls
2/25/2022,"Vladimir Putin has said there is broad public support for the invasion of Ukraine that he announced just before dawn on Thursday morning. But by evening, thousands of people in cities across Russia had defied police threats to take to central squares and protest against the military campaign. Police had made at least 1,702 arrest in 53 Russian cities as of Thursday evening, according to the OVD-Info monitor, as they cracked down on the unsanctioned protests. Most of the arrests were made in Moscow and St Petersburg, where the crowds were largest.  The protesters chanted: “No to war!” as they exchanged shocked reactions to the attack on Ukraine. In Moscow, Alexander Belov said he thought that Putin had “lost his mind”. “I thought that we would never see a war like this in the 21st century,” said Belov, who arrived early at Moscow’s Pushkinskaya Square to find it surrounded by police vans. “It turns out we live in the Middle Ages.” The mood in Moscow was dark and sombre hours after Putin had announced that he was launching a broad military offensive targeting Ukraine. “I am embarrassed for my country. To be honest with you, I am speechless. War is always scary. We don’t want this,” said Nikita Golubev, a 30-year-old teacher. “Why are we doing this?” His anger and hopelessness were shared by many commuting to work down central Arbat Street. At the Ukrainian culture centre just down the road, the mood was even grimmer. The Ukrainian administrator said the centre, which aims to promote the language, traditions and identity of a country Vladimir Putin denied the legitimacy of as a modern state in his speech on Monday, would be shut for the “coming period”. “We are being bombed as we speak. Of course we are closed! Jesus, what is happening?” the administrator, who did not want to give his name, shouted. There were already signs that Russians were uncomfortable with Putin’s initial decision to recognise the two self-proclaimed republics in Donbas. On Tuesday, Yuri Dudt, one of Russia’s most popular media personalities, said he “did not vote for this regime” and its need for an empire, and felt ashamed, in a post that received almost a million likes in 24 hours. A fresh poll by the independent Levada Center released on Thursday showed that only 45% of Russians stood in favour of the recognition move that preceded Thursday morning’s dramatic events. “I didn’t think Putin would be willing to go all the way. How can we bomb Ukraine? Our countries have their disagreements, but this is not a way to solve them,” said Muscovite Ksenia. But outcries of anger were not only felt on the streets of Moscow, where the Guardian did not encounter support for the military assault. Russia’s cultural and sporting elite, usually firmly behind Putin and often called upon by the president during election campaigns to gather popular support, also expressed their deep worries about Russia’s invasion. Valery Meladze, arguable the country’s most beloved singer, posted an emotional video in which he “begged” Russia to stop the war. “Today something happened that should have never happened. History will be the judge of these events. But today, I beg you, please stop the war.” Likewise, Russian football international Fyodor Smolov posted on his Instagram channel: “No to War!!!” US intelligence has for months warned that Russia would seek to fabricate a major pretext before launching an invasion of Ukraine. In the end, no major false flag came, and experts now believe that Putin decided to act without gathering the backing of his own electorate. “Putin seems totally indifferent to approval on the street. He’s acting not like a politician in need of public support, but like a figure from national history books who cares only about the approval of future historians and readers,” tweeted Alexander Baunov, a political analyst at the Carnegie Moscow Center. The Russian leader looked to have also surprised some of Russia’s most prominent oligarchs, who saw their wealth tumble as the country’s financial markets collapsed. Just on Monday, after Putin recognised the independence of the two Donbas territories, Oleg Deripaska, a Kremlin-friendly oligarch who once said that “he does not separate himself from the Russian state”, exclaimed on his Telegram channel that “war had been averted”. He has since deleted the post. On Russian state television, the invasion was framed as a defensive mission aimed at preserving Russian lives. “What’s the point of a major first strike? However strange or cynical it sounds, it’s actually humane because it allows everyone around to prevent a large massacre. By immobilising Ukraine, life is being preserved,” said pundit Vladislav Shurygin on the Channel One programme Vremya Pokazhet. Some risked arrest on Thursday evening in order to voice their opposition to the invasion. Zhargal Rinchinov from Buryatia arrived on the square in a jacket with the inscription: “No to war.” If he held up a sign, he said, he would be arrested. “Everyone is scared,” he said. “They know if they say something bad then they’ll be put in jail. So people pretend they don’t notice we have started a war, so they don’t have to speak up about it.” For Ukrainians, public messages of opposition to the war will come too late. The country has said that at least 40 soldiers have already been killed and many more civilians injured, as it is threatened with being overrun by a much larger military force. Yet, sensing that a genuine large-scale pushback against war might be Ukraine’s best bet, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, on Thursday morning urged Russians to speak up. “If the Russian authorities don’t want to sit down with us to discuss peace, maybe they will sit down with you.”",News/World news,Thousands join anti-war protests in Russia after Ukraine invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/we-dont-want-this-russians-react-to-the-ukraine-invasion
2/25/2022,"It began an hour before dawn, airstrikes and missiles raining down on military bases, airfields, border posts and cities across Ukraine, explosions lighting up the still-darkened sky from Odessa to Mariupol, Kharkiv to Dnipro, Lutsk to the capital, Kyiv. In the grey early light that followed, Russian tanks and troops began rolling across the border, columns of soldiers pouring into the eastern regions of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Luhansk. Others landed in the ports of Odessa and Mariupol.  In Moscow, shortly before 5am, Vladimir Putin had announced the launch of the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since the second world war. “I have decided,” he said, “to conduct a special military operation.” The assault, the Russian president said, was aimed at “the demilitarisation and denazification of Ukraine”, and any foreign country that tried to interfere risked “consequences you have never seen”. Barely an hour later, at 5.58am in Kyiv, as explosions rattled the city and sirens blared, Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted: “Putin has just launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Peaceful Ukrainian cities are under strikes.” This was “a war of aggression”, Kuleba said. “Ukraine will defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.” Minutes afterwards the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, addressed his nation in a tense video, saying explosions were now being heard “in many cities across the country”. He declared martial law. On the overnight train from the south-eastern port city of Mariupol to the capital – the last, perhaps, to make the journey for some time – passengers woke up to news from the now besieged city they had left behind. There was an air of grim calm; no shouting or weeping, no explosions of emotion. People flicked through their phones, watched snatches of video showing shelling; held long, subdued conversations with those now stuck behind the frontline and wondering what they should do next. The south and east were not the only regions of Ukraine under attack; reports soon began coming in of an armoured incursion, backed by Belarusian troops, through the Senkivka border crossing in the north, as well as of Russian armour moving into Ukraine from Crimea. By 7am, two hours into the assault, Russian-backed separatist rebels were launching multiple attacks on Ukrainian military positions around the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk in the south-east. Video footage showed Russian rockets hitting populated areas in major cities, despite Moscow’s claims that it was only targeting military infrastructure; pictures from Kharkiv showed the tail section of an unexploded rocket sticking out of the pavement close to an Orthodox church. Russia has amassed more than 150,000 combat troops on the borders of Ukraine, with another 34,000 lightly armed separatist forces in the self-proclaimed republics: an estimated two-thirds of the country’s total ground forces. Half its air force is also deployed in the region. As Europe awoke, leaders denounced the assault, warning of heavy casualties and a huge economic impact. Financial markets opened – and instantly plunged. Oil prices soared. Governments convened emergency meetings and readied new sanctions. In Kyiv, a city of three million people, the city’s mayor, Vitaly Klitschko, urged residents to stay at home unless they were involved in critical work and to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents in case they needed to evacuate. Some headed underground, seeking refuge in the metro. With reports suggesting Russian tanks were advancing on Kyiv from Belarus, barely 93 miles (150km) and two and a half hours’ drive and away, others hurriedly packed suitcases and took to trains, cars and buses; main roads leading out of the city started to back up from mid-morning. “We are facing a war, and horror. What could be worse?” said one resident, Liudmila Gireyeva, 64. She said she was planning to travel later in the day to the western city of Lviv, and then to try to move on to Poland to join her daughter. Putin “will be damned by history”, Gireyeva said. “Ukrainians are damning him.” As the train from Mariupol pulled into Kyiv, only an hour late, at 11am, those on board tumbled out into a city reeling from the start of hostilities few believed would reach such a terrifying scale. The station was crammed with people desperate to get on a train out – in almost any direction but eastwards. “My parents called me around 5am to say war is coming and I didn’t believe them,” said Anna Bolosheva, 27, taking a train to stay with relatives in a rural area to the north of Kyiv. “I opened the news and there wasn’t much about it – but then I heard the explosions. I couldn’t imagine it, and I can’t understand it. Yesterday I didn’t think this could happen.” Eight hours’ drive and 340 miles (550km) to the west, in the city of Lviv, near the Polish border, the queues for banks and pharmacies and supermarkets were already snaking round the block. Lviv had long seemed one of Ukraine’s safer cities, prompting several western embassies concerned about a possible Russian invasion to relocate there from Kyiv, but morning air raid sirens and news of Russian strikes in Lutsk to the north and Ivano-Frankivsk to the south had punctured that illusion. Glued to his phone was Ivan Taibov, 27, from Odessa. His screen showed video of a plume of smoke rising from his home city. “They’re calling for people to come to its defence,” he said. “I’m trying to see if it is possible to get back. There will be a fight.” Tanya Hrunyk, a 43-year-old economist waiting in one of the bank queues, was wondering whether to stay in Lviv and for how long. “I have family in the country where I could go. I’ll go if there’s an evacuation. Until then, I’m not sure,” she said. Asked what she thought of Putin’s reasons for attacking her country, Hrunyk said sharply: “He’s a crazy man. He’s mentally ill. Our task is to stay calm and united.” Ivan Borislavsky, a bartender who is expecting a baby with his partner in a month, said he was staying. “I need to fight for my wife and children and my land,” he said. Ukrainian officials confirmed video footage from several sources of a Russian helicopter assault at Hostomel, barely four miles from Kyiv. At least 20 Mi-8 and Ka-52 helicopters flew in from Belarus to attack an airfield that is home to the Antonov aircraft maker and has a runway long enough to handle big cargo planes. By lunchtime, casualties were starting to mount: 18 dead in a missile attack near Odessa, according to authorities; six more in Brovary, half an hour’s drive north-east of Kyiv. In Vuhledar, near Donetsk, an occupier’s shell hit the hospital, killing four people and injuring 10, including six doctors. Russia’s military claimed to have wiped out Ukraine’s air defences; Ukraine’s to have shot down five Russian aircraft and killed 50 soldiers on the eastern front. In Mariupol, in the far south-east, close to Russian-occupied territory, Yulia, a local journalist, said she had heard multiple heavy explosions on the opposite side of the city from the western Primorsky district where she was with her young son. “We’ve collected our stuff and are ready to run to a bomb shelter if necessary,” she said. But she added she was worried because she could not reach her mother, who lives in the eastern part of the city, by phone. “I hope it’s just because her phone battery has run out,” she said. In Kherson, east of Odessa, Svitlana described a column of Russian tanks, APCs, military trucks and rocket launchers moving inexorably north in the direction of Nova Kakhovka. “We are just sitting in our houses,” she said. “The shops are closed, nothing is working.” There was shelling earlier, but now it was quiet. Nearly 560 miles away in Moscow, banks and exchange bureaux opened for business but rapidly ran out of dollars as the Russian rouble plunged to an all-time low. Despite a barrage of state media propaganda, many residents expressed profound shock that Russia should have launched a full-scale attack on its neighbour. “I didn’t think Putin would be willing to go all the way. How can we bomb Ukraine? We have our disagreements, but this is not to a way to solve them,” said one appalled Muscovite, Ksenia Fadeeva. Another, Nikita Golubev, said: “I am embarrassed for my country. To be honest with you, I am speechless. War is always scary. We don’t want this.” Tatyana, who asked for her surname not to be published, said she “couldn’t believe the news I read this morning. A war with Ukraine? What are we doing? I feel powerless.” Ordinary citizens were not alone. Valery Meladze, arguably Russia’s most popular singer, posted an emotional video in which begged Russia to stop the war. “Today something happened that should have never happened. History will be the judge of these events. But today, I beg you, please stop the war,” he said. By 2pm, Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defence minister, was describing a situation that was still “extremely tense. There are thrusts happening. They are quite close to Kherson; the situation is critical there. They are trying to surround Kharkiv. Ukrainian armed forces are fighting quite seriously. There is no panic.” Shortly after, Ukraine called on the EU to urgently provide air defence and anti-missile systems, as well as use “all means” to jam Russian satellite signals, requesting an “end to business as usual” with Russia and “fierce measures against Belarus, which directly supported Russia’s full-scale invasion”. Russia’s defence ministry, meanwhile, claimed about 12 hours into the attack to have destroyed 74 Ukrainian military ground facilities, including 11 airfields, three command posts and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft missile systems. Back in Kyiv, the capital’s central railway station, Kyiv-Pasazhyrskyi, was crowded with hundreds of passengers seeking to leave. There were long queues for tickets and information. Several trains had been cancelled, marked red on the departure board, but others were functioning as normal. By 6pm, there were still huge queues of cars trying to escape the capital and head westward, with the main road out jammed with vehicles. Drivers stood next to their vehicles, patiently waiting for the route to clear. Mayor Klitschko ordered a 10pm-7am curfew but said metro stations would stay open all night for shelter. As darkness began to draw in at the end of the first day of what analysts have said may prove Europe’s fiercest conflict for more than 75 years, Zelenskiy turned to an earlier dark era, and a celebrated phrase from the end of that war. “What we have heard today are not just missile blasts, fighting and the rumble of aircraft,” the Ukrainian president warned. “This is the sound of a new iron curtain, which has come down and is closing Russia off from the civilised world. Our national task is to make sure this curtain does not fall across our land.”",News/World news,Airstrikes at dawn as Russia begins ‘war of aggression’ with Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/airstrikes-dawn-russia-begins-war-aggression-with-ukraine-vladimir-putin
2/25/2022,"Nearly every UK bank has struggled over the past decade managing the fallout of multibillion pound taxpayer bailouts, business scams or devastating IT meltdowns. But few have faced quite as many scandals, near-failures and turnaround efforts as the Co-operative Bank. During that period the mid-size lender has teetered on collapse, its former chief executive was charged for drug possession, it has been bailed out by a group of hedge funds and it has changed its boss six times in nine years.  But the bank, which has its roots in the ethical co-operative movements and was formed in 1872, has survived the fallout of the so-called Crystal Methodist scandal and is now enjoying relative stability under its hedge fund owners, who have seen it to its first profit in a decade. Its newest chief executive, Nick Slape, is insistent that the bank’s 150th anniversary this year will be a turning point. He says it is an opportunity to look beyond recent scandals and spark new excitement over the UK’s “original ethical bank”, which reported on Thursday a £31m profit for 2021 – its first since 2011. The Co-op Bank also more than tripled its bonus pot for bankers to £13.3m after what it described as a “milestone year”. Slape’s team have been rifling through archives to prepare for November’s anniversary. The bank traces its origins to the 1872 establishment of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, the body that would become the Co-operative Group. It was meant to provide financial services to the wider co-operative movement in Britain, in which member-owned businesses worked for the common good. While the bank has since separated from the group, having been taken over by its hedge fund investors as part of a £700m rescue deal in 2017, and no longer counts itself as a member-owned organisation, it has tried to maintain its ethical roots. Although hedge funds and private equity investors are often slated for their focus on maximising profits and short-term gains, Slape is quick to emphasise that the bank’s ethical policies are enshrined in its articles of association, which its shareholders have in effect signed up to. “We take it seriously: with real policies that are approved by the board, and a values and ethics committee that monitors it all, and we report it to the Co-operatives UK,” Slape said, referring to the national industry body that monitors and coordinates on behalf of co-operatives across the country. In 2019, the bank agreed to formally recognise a customer “union” aimed at protecting its ethical policies, which was formed out of the Save Our Bank campaign after the Co-operative Bank’s near collapse in 2013, the year the lender’s financial troubles first came to light. That year, a £1.5bn hole was discovered in its accounts after the disastrous 2009 takeover of the Britannia building society. “That led to its own kind of crisis over the next few years,” Slape said, resulting in the first rescue deal that started the bank’s disentanglement from the larger Co-operative Group. Its troubles were compounded when the bank’s former chair, the ex-Labour councillor and Methodist church minister Paul Flowers, nicknamed the Crystal Methodist, pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine, crystal meth and ketamine in 2014. Slape said Flowers’ charges drove away more customers than the bank’s balance sheet woes ever did. “The only time that they ever really moved away was with the news of the previous chairman that was in the tabloids,” he said. “That clearly played very much on the ethics and the values of the bank. So that’s when my predecessors saw [customer] attrition. Other than that, we’ve got really loyal customers that have stuck with us.” That loyalty was maintained even after the hedge funds took full control nearly five years ago. The group, which includes Silver Point Capital, GoldenTree, Anchorage Capital and Cyrus Capital and the fund manager Invesco, now collectively owns 85% of the bank, with the remainder held by a range of undisclosed institutional investors. Every Co-operative Bank chief executive since has been dogged by questions about when its hedge fund owners will plot an exit. They came close in November 2020, when the New York-based private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management offered about £270m to buy the lender. However, those talks broke down a month later. No further offers have been made and Slape, a former Lloyds, Deutsche Bank and Merrill Lynch banker, is setting his sights on future growth. Having already built up more capital – the​ financial cushion banks must hold to protect them from risky loans and products on their balance sheets – the Co-operative Bank has an opportunity finally to return some cash to its shareholders, or, as Slape puts it, “invest in something”. That could mean buying a loan portfolio or buying another bank to merge with the lender, which on its own has 3.2 million personal customers, 95,000 business clients and 50 branches across the UK. Slape’s team in October tabled a tentative offer, which has since been rejected, for the takeover of the banking rival TSB. But with the Co-operative Bank’s credit rating on the rise – Moody’s upgraded the bank’s unsecured debt rating by two notches last month – Slape says it has further opportunities on the horizon. “We’ve got some big enablers that have been put in place that are allowing us to sort of think about things that we couldn’t think about before, when we weren’t profitable. So all of these things are positive,” he said. Moody’s credited the bank’s upgrade on its “continued progress towards a more sustainable business model” and its improving profitability, but added that the latter could remain “very weak” during the next 12-18 months and that a further downgrade could be possible if profitability proved unsustainable beyond 2021. However, those risks seem unlikely to phase Slape, who is toying with the idea of a stock market flotation that would allow the Co-operative Bank’s longstanding hedge fund investors to exit by 2023. “We’ve got a strong board, we do all our reporting completely consistent of what you do as a public company. So it’s not a big step-change for us,” Slape said. “This is clearly an option.”",News/Business,"‘Milestone year’: in its 150th year, the Co-op Bank can see a brighter future",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/24/milestone-year-hedge-funds-mull-future-of-revived-co-op-bank
2/25/2022,"A group of 11 Labour MPs from the left of the party have removed their names from a statement about the invasion of Ukraine, which heavily criticises Nato after being warned they risked losing the party whip. In a rapid victory for Keir Starmer over MPs still linked to Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour chief whip wrote to the 11 backbenchers asking them to remove their signatures from a statement drawn up by the Stop the War group.  It is understood that Alan Campbell told the group, including Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Richard Burgon, that they risked losing the Labour whip if they did not remove their names. A party spokesperson later said all the MPs had agreed to do so. The Stop the War statement, which accuses the UK government of “sabre-rattling” over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, also criticises it for saying Ukraine has a right to join Nato if it wishes. It says the alliance “should call a halt to its eastward expansion and commit to a new security deal for Europe which meets the needs of all states and peoples,” adding: “We refute the idea that Nato is a defensive alliance, and believe its record in Afghanistan, Yugoslavia and Libya over the last generation, not to mention the US-British attack on Iraq, clearly proves otherwise.” While Corbyn is a long-term Nato sceptic, Starmer has stressed his support for the organisation. Writing in the Guardian earlier this month, the Labour leader said the party’s commitment to Nato “is unshakable”. He was also heavily critical of Stop the War, which first emerged before the 2003 invasion of Iraq by US and UK forces, and which Corbyn chaired before becoming Labour leader. The group did not represent “benign voices for peace”, Starmer said, adding: “At best they are naive, at worst they actively give succour to authoritarian leaders who directly threaten democracies. There is nothing progressive in showing solidarity with the aggressor when our allies need our solidarity and – crucially – our practical assistance now more than ever.” A Labour spokesperson said: “The small number of Labour MPs that signed the Stop The War statement have all now withdrawn their names. This shows Labour is under new management. With Keir Starmer’s leadership there will never be any confusion about whose side Labour is on – Britain, Nato, freedom and democracy – and every Labour MP now understands that.” The other MPs who signed the Stop the War statement were Tahir Ali, Apsana Begum, Ian Lavery, Ian Mearns, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, Zarah Sultana, Mick Whitley and Beth Winter. Other signatories included Corbyn, who is sitting as an independent after losing the Labour whip for refusing to rescind comments he made in the aftermath of the publication of the Equality and Human Rights Commission report on Labour’s handling of antisemitism complaints. It was also signed by Claudia Webbe, the Leicester East MP who was elected for Labour but sits as an independent after being found guilty of a campaign of harassment, including threatening an acid attack, against a woman. Andrew Scattergood, co-chairman of left-wing campaign group Momentum, said: “These MPs’ steadfast commitment to the Ukrainian people and against Russia’s invasion is beyond question. Indeed, many of them have led the criticism of Putin’s act of aggression today, forcefully and without reservation. “It beggars belief that the Labour leadership instead focuses on a week-old statement in an attempt to wage factional warfare against them, while a real war wages on against the Ukrainian people.”",News/Politics,Labour MPs drop backing for statement criticising Nato after Starmer warning,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/labour-mps-drop-backing-for-statement-criticising-nato-after-starmer-warning
2/25/2022,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has amplified pressure for tougher economic sanctions on Moscow. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, was among many to call for Moscow to be shut out of Swift – the world’s main international payments network – with the aim of hitting Russian trade and making it harder for its companies to do business.  Swift (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is the main secure messaging system that banks use to make rapid and secure cross-border payments, allowing international trade to flow smoothly. It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, about 38 million transactions were sent each day over the Swift platform, facilitating trillions of dollars’ worth of deals. Swift, founded in the 1970s, is a cooperative of thousands of member institutions that use the service. Based in Belgium, it remains neutral in trade disputes, being run principally as a service to its members. Boris Johnson told MPs it would harm the Russian economy if it were locked out of Swift. Run-of-the-mill transactions would need to be conducted directly between banks, or routed through fledgling rival systems, adding to costs and creating delays. One reason is that the impact on Russian businesses might not be so serious. The head of a large Russian bank, VTB, said recently he could use other channels for payments, such as phones, messaging apps or email. Russian banks could also route payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions, such as China, which has set up its own payments system to rival Swift. A ban on Russia using Swift could accelerate a the use of China’s rival Cips system. There is also a fear that it could damage to the US dollar’s status as the global reserve currency, and accelerate the use of alternatives such as cryptocurrencies. The Biden administration is also concerned that a ban could harm its allies as much as it does Russian firms. Russia is a big buyer of foreign manufactured goods, especially from the Netherlands and Germany. Russia is the main EU supplier of crude oil, natural gas and solid fossil fuels, and European countries could find it harder to find replacement suppliers. In the past, Swift has resisted calls to impose bans on certain countries, describing itself as neutral. But in 2012, the European Union barred Swift from serving Iranian firms and individuals sanctioned in relation to Tehran’s nuclear programme, setting a precedent for action against Russia. A Swift spokesperson declined to say how the organisation would respond to any US sanctions, Reuters said.",News/Technology,What is Swift and what would shutting Russia out of it achieve?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/24/what-is-swift-international-payments-network-russia-sanction
2/25/2022,"Wealthy undergraduates in England will be better off while women, disadvantaged students and those from the north and Midlands are most likely to be worse off under proposed changes to student finance, according to the government’s own analysis. After the official announcement of an overhaul of how graduates in England will repay tuition fee and maintenance loans in the future, ministers also urged universities to make “efficiencies” to cope with the reduced income they faced from a prolonged freeze on tuition fees.  The changes would result in students who enrol in 2023-24 having to make repayments for 40 years rather than 30 under the student loan system that has been in place since 2012. Save the Children labelled the reforms as “among the most regressive yet”, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that high-earning borrowers “stand to benefit substantially”. According to the IFS, graduates on lower-middle earnings would suffer the biggest proportionate loss, the equivalent of more than a penny in every pound they will ever earn during their lifetime. Middle and lower income graduates would also be hit by the government’s move to lower the repayment threshold from its current rate of £27,000 to £25,000 as the point at which graduates must use 9% of their income to repay loans. An equality analysis on the proposals by the Department for Education, states that “those likely to see some negative impact with increased lifetime repayments under the reforms” include younger and female graduates as well as graduates “from disadvantaged backgrounds, or reside in the north, Midlands, south-west or Yorkshire and the Humber”. The analysis shows that the lifetime repayments of a graduate in 2023-24, earning £22,000 in current prices with projected lifetime earnings of £850,000, would rise by 150% – from just below £9,700 now to £24,000. In contrast, the loan repayments of a graduate in the top 10% of earnings with an annual pay of £88,000, who would enjoy lifetime earnings of £3.5m, would drop from £53,000 to £39,000. Wealthy graduates particularly benefit from the government’s decision to stop charging higher earners an extra 3% interest rate. The changes will set interest at the rate of inflation, which the universities minister Michelle Donelan hailed as “injecting fairness into the system”. The IFS’s analysis said the changes would substantially increase the proportion who pay off their student loans, which now average close to £50,000. Students from a wealthier background tend to have lower borrowings as the amount of maintenance loan is linked to parental income. Whereas only a quarter of graduates are expected to have repaid their loans in full within 30 years of graduation, under the new system 60% can be expected to. “The long-run benefit for the taxpayer will be modest at around £1bn per cohort of university entrants, as higher repayments by borrowers with low or middling earnings will be mostly offset by lower repayments of high-earning borrowers,” the IFS said. On top of higher repayments, the institutions at which students study will receive less in real terms. Donelan confirmed that tuition fees will remain frozen for a further two years, at no more than £9,250 for English universities, meaning an effective cut after inflation. “We’re asking everybody to share this balance, and we want to continue to drive the sector to find efficiencies. There are more efficiencies that can be found and it is important that students get value for money for their degree,” Donelan said. The government is to commit an extra £900m over three years, including £750m for teaching targeted at science, technology, medicine and other high priority subjects. But the Russell Group of research universities said inflation meant the extra grant would not be enough to compensate for the cost of such courses. The Department for Education also published a controversial consultation to restrict numbers on certain courses, and set minimum criteria for school leavers to qualify for student loans, such as requiring at least a grade 4 in GCSE maths and English. Martin McLean, of the National Deaf Children’s Society, said: “This misguided proposal would make it even harder for deaf young people to reach higher education and it must not go ahead.” The government also announced that a consultation on shifting the university admissions process until after A-level results had been dropped because it was too complex.",News/Education,"England student loan changes will hit poor hardest, official analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/24/england-student-loan-changes-will-hit-poor-hardest-official-analysis-finds
2/25/2022,"Thousands of Ukrainians have left the country and as many as 100,000 are internally displaced after fleeing their homes following the attack ordered by Vladimir Putin, the UN refugee agency has said. Videos and photos on social media show lines of cars moving out of cities and heading west, as well as an increase of people on foot near the southern and western borders.  The United Nations refugee agency said on Thursday that the situation was quickly deteriorating after Russia’s invasion, estimating that several thousand had already fled with more expected to follow. It appealed to neighbouring countries to keep their borders open to people seeking a safe haven. “We have already seen reports of casualties and people starting to flee their homes to seek safety,” said Filippo Grandi, the UN high commissioner for refugees. At the Luzhanka border crossing with Hungary in western Ukraine, hundreds of cars waited in a queue snaking more than 2 kilometres back from the border on Thursday afternoon. People said they had been waiting over six hours in line to cross. A steady stream of people crossed on foot, carrying suitcases and holdalls stuffed with belongings. Many were Ukrainians from the Hungarian minority that live in the west of the country, and said they were traveling to stay with relatives for a few days in the hope the danger would pass. Others had come from other parts of Ukraine and planned to drive on to Western Europe. “The people who have money are leaving,” said one of the customs officials at the post. He said over 1,500 people had left through the crossing by 4pm on Thursday, as opposed to just a few hundred on a normal day. One 19-year-old man from the town of Svyalava said he had left both because he was scared of Russian assault and of potentially being called up to the Ukrainian army. “My brother lives in Hungary and I’ll stay with him as long as it takes,” he said, waiting at the border post. He asked not to use his name. Others also said they were fleeing before receiving army call-ups. People carrying luggage and accompanied by children crossed into the Polish city of Medyka, and lines of cars stretching for miles were reported on the approach to Ukraine’s border with Moldova. For weeks, central European countries on Ukraine’s western border have been making preparations for a potential influx of millions of refugees. Authorities in the countries next to Ukraine have already identified border crossings through which people can leave the country by land, such as Vyšné Nemecké in Slovakia, Záhony in Hungary, Siret in Romania, and Palanca in Moldova. Maia Sandu, the president of Moldova, said on Thursday there was an increase in traffic flow on the border. Poland is preparing a train, with medical equipment, to transport wounded civilians from the Ukrainian border to Polish hospitals, said the country’s health minister. “We are preparing a sanitary train with full rescue service and medical equipment to transport the injured,” said Adam Niedzielski. “This solution was created completely from scratch and, so far, has not been used in Poland. At the same time, we already have a list of 120 hospitals throughout the country to which victims may go. In total, we estimate at the moment that it would be possible to admit several thousand patients.” Poland, in particular, has been preparing for various scenarios, including a wave of up to a million people fleeing Ukraine, said Maciej Wąsik, the deputy interior minister. Poland is already home to about 2 million Ukrainians, many of whom moved after the 2014 conflict, and they have taken advantage of a relatively easy scheme to gain work permits. The government has said it is planning to house Ukrainian refugees in hostels, dormitories and sports facilities. A few days ago, local authorities in the countries bordering Ukraine were asked to indicate the list of accommodation facilities for refugees, the number of people it would be possible to accommodate, the costs involved and the timeframe for the adaptation of buildings. The ground floor of the exhibition centre in the south-eastern Polish city of Rzeszów has been equipped to receive people who may flee Ukraine, about 30 miles to the east. Germany has said it will offer support to countries in eastern and central Europe, especially Poland, facing an influx of refugees. German media have cited estimates that between 200,000 and a million people may flee to the EU from Ukraine in the event of a war. “We will offer massive support to the affected states – especially our neighbour Poland – in the event of large refugee movements,” the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said in a statement, adding she had been in touch with the Polish government and the European Commission. Franziska Giffey, the mayor of Berlin, told news outlet RBB 24 that the German capital was preparing for the arrival of refugees. “For next week, we have set ourselves the goal of discussing concrete implications, what preparations we can make, especially in the event of people fleeing this situation,” Giffey said. Other countries in Europe have offered support to countries in eastern Europe in case of a wave of refugees leaving Ukraine. António Costa, the prime minister of Portugal, said potential refugees from Ukraine were welcome in the Iberian country, home to a large Ukrainian community. “Ukrainian citizens who have family, friends and acquaintances here are welcome in Portugal,” Costa said, promising to facilitate the issuance of entry visas.",News/World news,Thousands of Ukrainians flee country after Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/ukraine-russia-flee-country-invasion
2/25/2022,"There is no shock today, only profound horror at what Russia has already unleashed upon Ukraine, and at what is to come. The invasion launched in the early hours is illegal, immoral and outrageous. It is, above all, a catastrophe for Ukraine: a massive assault by an aggressor with a well-documented ruthlessness and disdain for civilian lives. But as the country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned: “The fate of not only our state is being decided, but also what Europe will be like.” A country that endured so many 20th-century traumas is now experiencing the continent’s biggest attack by one state on another since the second world war.  The unprovoked assault does not merely destroy the hopes of 1991. It is also a terrible blow to the broader international system. Vladimir Putin launched this attack even as the UN security council made its last desperate attempts to stave it off, and as the secretary general, António Guterres, pleaded with him publicly to call off his troops. It is true that the rules which prevailed after 1945 have been honoured perhaps as often in the breach as the observance. But the Russian president has spelt out his utter contempt for the teetering rules-based international order at its very heart. Russia claimed for months that it would not invade; its assurances that it will not occupy Ukraine are worth nothing. Even on its own supposed logic, the request for military help from the breakaway “republics” in the east cannot explain why troops are advancing from the north and south, and bombarding targets across the country. Mr Putin says that he wants to “demilitarise” and “de-nazify” a democratic country that freely chose its Jewish president. Kyiv believes his aim is to topple the government and install a puppet regime. How far the Russian president goes may be determined in large part by the Ukrainian response, and the costs its military can inflict. Mr Putin warned against other countries “meddling”, with the chilling warning that otherwise there would be “consequences you have never encountered in your history” – a barely coded nuclear threat – though Ukraine has long known it will fight alone, albeit strengthened by the recent influx of arms and advice. A brave minority in Russia have publicly decried this war. Even allowing for his work to insulate his country – amassing foreign currency, reducing western imports and increasing links with China and others – it is likely to pay for this assault with a weakened economy, increasing isolation, a reinvigorated Nato and a bitterly anti-Russian Ukraine. Though state media is pumping out propaganda, and internet censors threatened others with fines if they used non-official sources in their reporting, Mr Putin has done strikingly little to prepare the public for the invasion, or its costs. Yet a president who has twinned aggression abroad with repression at home seems indifferent not only to those costs, but also to the public response to them. Ukrainians now need and deserve the staunchest support. Those who flee must be given a true welcome by western Europe as well as neighbouring countries. But the big question is what price Ukraine’s backers are willing to pay. The UK and EU promised “massive” sanctions, but hours after the invasion, states were still bickering over how far to go. A further hike in energy prices could tip countries into rampant inflation and potentially recession, with the danger of political destabilisation and further division as citizens struggle to get by. Mr Putin has reason to believe that he can weather the reaction. Nord Stream 2 is now on hold; yet its construction began just one year after Russia annexed Crimea. Ukraine’s friends must make clear that this time is different, with a sustained as well as large-scale response. Serious attempts to counter Moscow’s aggression must start now, but will be the work of years. It will take years, too, to understand the new era on which we are all now embarking.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Putin’s war in Ukraine: a bleak new beginning | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-putins-war-in-ukraine-a-bleak-new-beginning
2/25/2022,"Boris Johnson was quickly out of the blocks when the news arrived from Ukraine before dawn. By 5am, a tweet was out in his name condemning Russia’s military invasion and promising a decisive response. He spent the morning getting briefed and on the phone to other leaders, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. At midday he broadcast to the nation, and in the early afternoon he took part in a virtual G7 meeting to coordinate sanctions against Russia with the US, the EU, Japan and Canada. By 5pm, he was spelling out the UK’s new plans in the House of Commons. Mr Johnson is a prime minister on probation with his own party. His initial announcement of sanctions against a handful of Russian banks and oligarchs had been scorned, including by Tories, as underwhelming.  So Thursday night’s new package went further, as it should have done even without Russia’s assault. Although the G7 failed to agree to exclude Russia from the Swift international banking system, the package they agreed is substantial. Mr Johnson announced new curbs covering banks, exports, the freezing of assets and a ban on the Russian airline Aeroflot. Whether this will “hobble the Russian economy”, as Mr Johnson promised in his broadcast, remains to be seen. But the exercise shows the incomparable value of working together with allies. These were the easier bits. Warm words are Mr Johnson’s comfort zone. But the invasion of Ukraine is not a verbal joust. It is a violent and dangerous fact. It will not be reversed by sonorous phrases. To do that requires serious planning, deliverable agreements, effective deeds, the building of trust with allies, and sustaining the effort over a long period, if necessary at some financial and human cost. This is the bit where Mr Johnson always falls down. Nevertheless, these leadership qualities are essential in the dangerous new world that Russia created this week. This is, as Keir Starmer said, a turning point. Mr Johnson talked some of the talk in his broadcast, with references to “our European continent”, about Ukrainian “neighbours and co-workers”, and about responding “in concert with our allies”. He was quite right. But is he capable of turning words into consistent realities? To do so will demand a major change in approach from the government and the prime minister. In particular, it will mean working hard, consistently and reliably with the EU and allied European governments on big issues like defence, intelligence, energy, sanctions and the treatment of refugees. It will require an end to smug claims to be world-leading, to threats to break treaty commitments, and to public digs at neighbours and allies. It is a tall order. Dangerous times demand it all the same. There were hints of a new approach on Thursday. But Mr Johnson remains very much on probation.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Britain and Ukraine: play our part | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-britain-and-ukraine-play-our-part
2/25/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s decision to launch a catastrophic new European war, combined with the sheer weirdness of his recent public appearances, has raised questions in western capitals about the mental stability of the leader of a country with 6,000 nuclear warheads. They worry about a 69-year-old man whose tendency towards insularity has been amplified by his precautions against Covid, leaving him surrounded by an ever-shrinking coterie of fearful obedient courtiers. He appears increasingly uncoupled from the contemporary world, preferring to burrow deep into history and a personal quest for greatness.  The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is well-placed to analyse changes to Putin’s demeanour. Macron once drove a cooperative, if self-conscious, Putin round the gardens of the palace of Versailles in a tiny electric golf cart in the summer of 2017 and welcomed him to his holiday residence at a fortress on the Mediterranean coast the following summer, where Putin descended from a helicopter carrying a bunch of flowers and complemented the Macrons on their tans. After Macron held five hours of talks with the Russian leader in Moscow at opposite ends of a 15-metre table, he told reporters on the return flight that “the tension was palpable”. This was not the same Putin he had last met at the Elysée palace in December 2019, Macron said. He was “more rigid, more isolated” and was off on an “ideological and security drift”. Following Putin’s speech on Monday, an Elysée official made an unusually bold assessment that the speech was “paranoid”. Bernard Guetta, a member of the European parliament for Macron’s grouping, told France Inter radio on Thursday morning, after military invasion began: “I think this man is losing his sense of reality, to say it politely.” Asked by the interviewer if that meant he thought Putin had gone mad, he said “yes”. Guetta is not alone. Milos Zeman, the Czech president and long one of Vlaldimir Putin’s staunchest supporters, denounced Putin a “madman” after the invasion. “All our Russia-watchers, watching his press conferences, think that he’s descending even more into a despotic mindset,” another European diplomat said. Vladimir Ashurkov, a close aide of Alexei Navalny, Putin’s most prominent opponent who is now in a penal colony, described Monday’s rambling speech by the Russian president about Ukraine as “really bizarre”. “It’s unprecedented in the rhetoric of world leaders, but also for Russia. It’s quite strange,” said Ashurkov, who is executive director of Navalny Anti-Corruption Foundation, and lives in exile. “Why would you spend so much time, you know, looking back into the past, when we now live in the 21st century? We should be looking into the future. It puzzles me as to what audience is intended for such as speech, because it’s not going to resonate with Russians and it’s rubbish for an international audience. “I think he’s in some sort of self-induced concept of reality that is very revanchist, based in the past, and in the trauma of the dissolution of Soviet Union,” he said. “Frankly speaking, we are in a situation where the leader of a major nuclear country is living in his own world.” According to an estimate by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads, even more than the US, its own rival in that field. Putin frequently refers to that huge arsenal, and made a thinly veiled reference to them when he launched the war on Ukraine. He said: “Whoever would try to stop us and further create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia’s response will be immediate and lead you to such consequences that you have never faced in your history. We are ready for any outcome.” Nato’s North Atlantic Council responded with similar open-ended language, saying: “We have increased the readiness of our forces to respond to all contingencies.” The US and Nato have made it very clear that they will not intervene directly in Ukraine, but their forces are in ever closer proximity and they have vowed to keep sending arms to Ukrainian forces if they become a guerilla resistance to Russian occupation. An errant Russian missile hit a Turkish-owned cargo ship in the Black Sea off the coast from the port city of Odessa on the first day of fighting. There have already been close encounters between Russian and Nato planes, while their naval forces will brush alongside each other. Ukraine has asked Turkey to close the Dardanelles Strait to Russian warships, to stop them moving from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. Putin could also see the Nato provision of weapons, or certain types of sanctions as strategic threat, and respond in an unpredictable way. Emma Claire Foley, a researcher at Global Zero, a disarmament advocacy group said she worries about “the risks of having all these troops, all this material, in close proximity plus the sort of the ambiguity that an actual war introduces for people who are trying to understand the meaning of the other side’s actions, especially when communication is limited.” Hans Kristensen, director of FAS’s nuclear information project said that any unintended clash would have to go through several phases of escalation before nuclear weapons would be contemplated, but he cautioned: “If a direct clash happened, that escalation to that point could happen quickly. “It doesn’t necessarily have to go according to plan.” In a crisis, it would be very much up to Putin how to react and whether to escalate. Like a US president, he has access to a nuclear briefcase, the Chegets, with nuclear launch code. According to an analysis by the Middlebury Institute for International Studies at Monterey, the defence minister and chief of staff of the armed forces are also supposed to be involved, but in Putin’s Kremlin it is unclear whether they would act as any kind of brake on his actions. “Nuclear weapons are an interesting exception to the general rule that the psychology of world leaders is less important than the systems they work in,” Foley said. “Don’t assume that this could proceed in an orderly fashion. It could spin out of control very easily.”",News/World news,Decision to invade Ukraine raises questions over Putin’s ‘sense of reality’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/putin-russian-president-ukraine-invasion-mental-fitness
2/25/2022,"Boris Johnson has been formally reprimanded by the official statistics watchdog for the second time in a month after he misleadingly claimed that there are now more people in work in the UK than before the start of coronavirus. The reproach from Sir David Norgrove, the head of the UK Statistics Authority, follows concerns he raised with Johnson at the start of February about an incorrect claim that crime levels were falling.  In his new letter to Johnson, Norgrove noted that at prime minister’s questions on Wednesday the PM had said there were now more people in employment than before the pandemic began. However, Norgrove said, this was only the case if you considered only workers on payrolls, which was misleading, as it was more than offset by a drop in numbers of self-employed people – if you include them, the total is now 600,000 lower. “If, as seems to be the case, your statement referred only to the increase in the number of people on payrolls, it would be a selective use of data that is likely to give a misleading impression of trends in the labour market, unless that distinction is carefully explained,” Norgrove told Johnson. He added: “I hope you will agree that public trust requires a complete statement of this important measure of the economy.” Johnson has made the same misleading claim at earlier editions of prime minister’s questions. On 3 February, Norgrove announced that he would be writing to the offices of Johnson and Priti Patel, the home secretary, to highlight what he called a “misleading” use of crime statistics. Speaking in the Commons, Johnson had said the government was “cutting crime by 14%”, a reference to statistics between September 2019 and September 2021, a claim echoed in a Home Office press release. However, this was only the case if the statistics excluded fraud and computer misuse, which have risen quickly over the Covid period.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson again reprimanded after misleading employment claim,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/boris-johnson-again-reprimanded-after-misleading-employment-claim
2/25/2022,"Warren East picked a bad day to announce he’ll be off from Rolls-Royce at the end of the year but, then, his entire spell as chief executive has been an exercise in managing the unexpected. He inherited troublesome Trent 1000 engines, issued two profits warnings in his first six months in 2015 and had to cope with a thumping fine from the Serious Fraud Office for events before his time. Just when the clouds cleared, and £1bn of annual cashflow could be glimpsed, the pandemic struck, obliterating income that depended on aircraft with Rolls engines recording hours in the air. By the autumn of 2020, the company’s survival was in doubt. The painful remedy was a £7bn package comprising a hefty rights issue, extra borrowing, asset disposals and a heavy round of job losses.  Against that backdrop, the direct fresh uncertainty for Rolls created by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could almost be viewed as modest. Annual revenues from Russian airlines may dwindle towards zero with sanctions, but the current figure (£170m) is tiny in a group context. A more serious problem may be sourcing titanium for engines since Rolls buys 20% of its supply from Russia but, in the end, that headache ought to be manageable. The effect of indirect uncertainties, though, is hard to assess. Further delay to the recovery in the long-haul civil aviation market is now the way to bet, especially if oil prices stay above $100 a barrel, but the degree is anyone’s guess. In the circumstances, an underwhelming forecast of “positive free cashflow” and “broadly unchanged” operating profit margins of 3.8% in 2022 wasn’t much comfort for investors who crave medium-term predictability. The shares fell 13%. The shame is that East has done an excellent job. The boast that Rolls is now “a more balanced and more sustainable business” is basically correct, especially the second part thanks to net zero efforts in electric power systems, clean jet fuel, small modular reactors and the like. East has 10 months left, which probably won’t be long enough for him to prove his point in terms of the share price. Keep going, though. Chris O’Shea, chief executive of Centrica, owner of British Gas, is displaying more savvy than his predecessor. Outrage over boardroom bonuses was almost an annual occurrence during Iain Conn’s ill-starred reign of credit downgrades, dividend cuts and a crumbling share price. By contrast, O’Shea is forfeiting a £1.1m bonus in sympathy with customers facing rocketing energy bills. Sensible. It remains to be seen whether the move, plus a return of £27m of furlough money, will count for anything amid continuing talk of windfall taxes, where Centrica is theoretically exposed thanks to its remaining North Sea oil and gas fields that were the biggest driver of the group’s doubled operating profits of £948m for 2021. But one has to concede that O’Shea has a point about regular taxes looking windfall-ish from the point of view of the Treasury: Centrica’s bill was £480m, versus virtually nothing a year ago. Whatever happens on that front, O’Shea is definitely correct in his call for banking-style “prudential regulation” for retail energy suppliers given that failed companies invariably impose costs on everybody’s customers. He means “fit and proper” tests and, crucially, ring-fencing of customers’ deposits. Centrica has recently adopted the latter policy voluntarily but all firms should be made to fall into line sharpish. Critics may spy a plot to favour large suppliers. Actually, it’s a matter of treating punters fairly. The entire UK financial industry seems obsessed with the idea of catering for the needs of the “mass affluent”, by which they mean people with investable savings of more than £75,000, and here comes Charlie Nunn, new chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group with his version. One sees the appeal. We’re told that, on average, Lloyds customers hold 2.4 financial products with the bank but have seven overall. So use all those data insights to grab a bit more business from a semi-captive audience. That’s the theory, but banks (including Lloyds) have been round this cross-selling track in the past and have found that specialist providers tend to defend their territory fiercely. To be fair, Lloyds, by virtue of its sheer size, probably stands a fair chance of success. And Nunn set a few hard targets for extra revenues from a £4bn investment plan that, it should be said, is wider than just wealth management. After almost a decade of no growth at Lloyds during its recovery phase, he had to try something new. But one can’t call it a bold new direction. That may be a good thing, of course.",News/Business,"East’s departure from Rolls-Royce is bad timing, but he’s done well | Nils Pratley",https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/24/easts-departure-from-rolls-royce-is-bad-timing-but-hes-done-well
