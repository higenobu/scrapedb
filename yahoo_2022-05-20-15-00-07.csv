5/20/2022,"Less than 48 hours after his shocking defeat in North Carolina’s primary election, Rep. Madison Cawthorn took to Instagram to post a defiant, vengeful, and typo-riddled message promising a “Dark MAGA” comeback. After decrying the establishment-driven campaign to unseat him following a long series of scandals, Cawthorn credited those he called his true allies, specifically naming figures like former President Donald Trump, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), “the great Charlie Kirk,” and Tucker Carlson. “I am on a mission now to expose those who say and promise one thing yet legislate and work towards another, self-profiteering, globalist goal,” Cawthorn said. “It’s time for the rise of the new right, it’s time for Dark MAGA to truly take command.” Before vowing that this Dark MAGA would “defeat the cowardly and weak members of our own party,” Cawthorn said the “time for gentile politics as usual has come to an end,” presumably not in reference to the politics of non-Jews. GOP state Sen. Chuck Edwards defeated Cawthorn by 1.5 percentage points in Tuesday night’s primary election, and the 26-year old incumbent may serve out his term until January 2023.

5/20/2022,"CONCORD, N.H. (AP) — The wife of a New Hampshire man accused of killing her co-worker after he discovered they were texting — and then forcing her to behead him — denied shooting him Wednesday, and testified that both were brutally assaulted by her husband in the hours leading up to the death that night. Britany Barron, 33, testified at her husband's first-degree murder trial that he choked and punched her and eventually put his gun into her mouth. “You know that you’re going to die tonight, right?” she testified her husband, Armando Barron, said in September 2020, not long before the two left the house to go to the park where he allegedly used her phone to tell the co-worker to meet her there. “Don't do anything stupid or the girls are going to walk into something (expletive) gruesome,"" she testified he said as they were leaving. He had sent the couple's three young children to go to their grandmother's home next door. On the way to the park, he read the texts aloud, striking her after finishing each one, she said. Britany, who asked a prosecutor in the Keene courtroom to address her by her maiden name, Mitchell, also testified that just a week earlier, she had told Armando she no longer loved him and wanted a divorce. When he heard that, he grabbed her throat and started choking her, saying, “Are you serious?"" She denied early in her testimony that she was the one who shot Jonathan Amerault, as a defense lawyer alleged during opening statements Tuesday. She pointed to her husband as the shooter. Barron pleaded not guilty to killing Amerault, 25. He acknowledged in court Tuesday that he had struck Britany, broke her nose, attempted to strangle her, and kicked Amerault in the head. Prosecutors allege that Armando Barron, 32, used his wife's cellphone to lure Amerault to the park just north of the Massachusetts state line the night he discovered the texts, beat and kicked Amerault and and tried to force his wife to shoot him. She refused. He also forced her to stand on his neck and slit his wrists, they said. Armando Barron forced Amerault into the back of the victim's car and told Britany to get into the driver's seat, she testified. At one point, he left them alone, she said. There was a machete inside and Britany testified that Amerault told her to pick it up and kill her husband, but she said no. “I wasn't going to test him,"" she said. She said Armando Barron eventually got into the car and shot Amerault three times. Barron had his wife drive the car back to their home in Jaffrey to pack some supplies, and he followed in the couple's car. They then headed 200 miles north (322 kilometers) to a remote campsite, with Barron talking on the phone with her throughout the trip, she testified. There, Armando Barron allegedly forced her to cut off Amerault’s head and bury it and wrap the body in a tarp. He left her to dispose of the body and returned home, she testified. “He said that we needed to cut off his head so that there would be no dental records of the body,"" Britany testified, saying she used a saw brought from home. She testified that they both destroyed evidence. The body was found by New Hampshire Fish and Game officers in a swamp after they found Britany at the campsite, where she was not allowed to camp. Britany testified that she and Amerault got to know each other better while working on a project in the days leading to his death and communicated via texting and social media apps. One afternoon, they drove to a nearby park after work and talked. She described him as kind, sweet and funny. “I said I couldn't offer anything more than friendship,"" she testified, and later gave him a quick kiss when he returned her to work so she could get her car. They shared one more kiss during a work break that week, a day before the texts were discovered. Britany pleaded guilty last year to three counts of falsifying evidence and was released from jail on parole last month. She apologized to Amerault’s family during her sentencing. The Associated Press had not been naming the couple in order not to identify Britany Barron, who said she suffered extreme abuse. Through her lawyer, she recently agreed to the use of her name.",U.S./Associated Press,Wife denies shooting co-worker in beheading case,https://news.yahoo.com/wife-denies-shooting-co-worker-170511760.html
5/20/2022,"On a sunny day at The Boathouse, a Santa Barbara restaurant, a Karen decided to cause an unnecessary ruckus. In a five-minute video recording of the incident, the woman confronts the person recording, a Black man, and takes things to another level.
 On May 11, Ian Soleimani, a local DJ, shared to his Instagram the footage he caught of the incident. The Daily Dot reported the woman had tried to pay at the restaurant with a PayPal card but the transaction declined. The restaurant allegedly held her ID and told her to come back the next day with another payment method. In the video, the woman goes back and forth with the manager asking for her ID and insisting she paid.

Toasted: Jerk Chicken Empanadas and Mango Chili Sauce “What part of you rejecting the payment don’t you recall because I know it wasn’t you, it was your Dr. Phil,” the woman said in the video. Then, she notices Soleimani recording her. More from the Daily Dot: “Hi, one of four black men in Santa Barbara,” she tells him. “Oh, now I’m a racist, terrible person. Oh, sorry, just because you’re an obnoxious guy. It’s not your fault that you’re black, of course.” “I’m against obnoxious people to be fair, not against black people,” she continues. The woman then turns to Soleimani and once again mentions his race amidst sarcastically calling him Mother Theresa for recording. “Again, don’t you have some fish to catch, African-American man?” she says. According to one of Soleimani’s comments on his Instagram post, he was wearing a Santa Barbara Fish Market sweater which may have prompted the woman’s fishing comments. “Don’t you want to go on a boat and do some African-American fishing?” It’s not your fault you’re Black?? African-American fishing?? Watch the full video from Soleimani’s Instagram page. Anywho, the situation concluded with the woman getting her ID back while also being told she’s not allowed at the restaurant again. Soleimani told The Daily Dot this wasn’t the first time somebody racist was kicked out the establishment. “People have been kicked out of boathouse a few times for [racially] motivated comments towards myself unfortunately. After experiencing stuff like that on and off for as long as that restaurant has been open, just doesn’t surprise me. Just learned how to deal with it better,” said Soleimani. Oh! And apparently the restaurant manager’s husband confirmed the woman’s name was in fact, Karen.",U.S./The Root,"“Don’t you have some fish to catch, African-American man?” says Santa Barbara Karen",https://news.yahoo.com/don-t-fish-catch-african-200112161.html
5/20/2022,"Ukrainians have been forced to turn every aspect of their life into methods of fighting the Russians, leading to some innovative weapons and tactics developed from everyday civilian items. In something more reminiscent of a video game or action movie it has been reported that Ukrainian soldiers have been using e-bikes armed with missiles to take out Russian tanks. The bikes have been given to the military by e-bike maker Delfast. Soldiers have then modified them to carry NLAW rockets or other anti-armour weapons. The UK has supplied thousands of NLAW missiles to the Ukrainian army since the start of the conflict. Read more: What is an anti-tank weapon and how do they work? They are delivered in the handheld launcher which can only be used a single time. They are designed to be operated by a single person and are relatively light - but still cost tens of thousands of pounds each. The use of the anti-tank missiles has been a key player in Ukraine's ability to slow the Russian advance on several fronts. NLAWs (or Next Generation Light Antitank Weapons) deliberately target the soft spot between the turret of the tank and the body. The targeting computer does 95% of the work, meaning all the soldier needs to do is find a safe place with a clear view of the target to fire from.

The military has utilised the silent nature of the e-bikes and their mobility to help get their soldiers into position. Militaries across the world have begun trailing e-bikes in their arsenals, usually to assist with getting soldiers quickly into position or to assist with patrols. The conflict in Ukraine is now mostly concentrated in the east and south of the country as Russian forces gave up on their wider ambitions of conquering the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv.",World/Yahoo News UK,Ukrainians using e-bikes mounted with missiles to blow up Russian tanks,https://news.yahoo.com/ukrainians-e-bikes-mounted-missiles-blow-up-russian-tanks-175221749.html
