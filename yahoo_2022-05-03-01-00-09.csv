5/3/2022,"A veteran rattlesnake handler died on Saturday, April 30, hours after a snake bit him during a show, Texas officials say. Eugene De Leon Sr. was bitten on the shoulder during the Rattlesnake Roundup event in Freer, police told KII-TV. He was flown to a Corpus Christi hospital, where he died, police told the station. Organizers of the Kendall County Fair Association say De Leon died “doing what he loved, being with the rattlesnakes.” Rattlesnake Roundup is put on by the Freer Chamber of Commerce, which mourned De Leon’s death in a post on Facebook. “The love and dedication he displayed for his community was witnessed everyday from being a member of the Freer Vol. Fire Department to being a call away for local residents to assist with removing snakes from their property,” the chamber of commerce said. “He was always ready to help. We will never forget his excitement during Roundup time, from doing interviews with television stations to appearing on televised wildlife shows, he did it all.” His sister said De Leon “had a passion for snake handling” and handled rattlers for “many years.” “He was well loved by those who knew him,” added U.S. Congress candidate Sandra Whitten. “My family and I enjoy watching him handle these deadly snakes with ease, almost like he was simply dancing with them. He had a smile on his face and clearly joy in his heart.” Freer is in southern Texas about 110 miles south of San Antonio.",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,Rattlesnake handler dies ‘doing what he loved’ after being bitten during Texas show,https://news.yahoo.com/rattlesnake-handler-dies-doing-loved-144307836.html
5/3/2022,"AOC said student-loan forgiveness is good, even for those who have already paid off their loans. Biden is getting closer to acting on debt relief, saying a decision will be made in the coming weeks. He told reporters he isn't considering $50,000 in forgiveness — an amount progressives have pushed for. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez says student-loan forgiveness is good for everyone — even those who already paid off their debt. ""Maybe student loan forgiveness doesn't impact you,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote in an Instagram story, in response to a question on the benefits of debt cancellation for those who already paid off their loans. ""That doesn't make it bad. I am sure there are certainly other things that student loan borrowers' taxes pay for. We can do good things and reject the scarcity mindset that says doing something good for someone else comes at the cost of something for ourselves."" ""It all comes around,"" she added. ""It's okay. We can support things we won't directly benefit from."" The student-loan forgiveness conversation is picking up steam after President Joe Biden told reporters last week a decision on relief will be made ""in the next couple of weeks."" While he said he is not considering canceling $50,000 in student debt for every federal borrower — an amount many progressives have been pushing for — a number of reports have suggested the president is considering at least $10,000 in relief that will likely be tied to income limits, and it will be implemented before the pause on payments expires after August 31. While broad loan forgiveness is something many Democrats would like to see carried out, Ocasio-Cortez told the Washington Post she has concerns with subjecting the relief to income thresholds. ""I don't believe in a cutoff, especially for so many of the front-line workers who are drowning in debt and would likely be excluded from relief,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""Canceling $50,000 in debt is where you really make a dent in inequality and the racial wealth gap. $10,000 isn't."" Republican lawmakers feel differently. Since the news came out that the president is considering canceling some amount of student debt this summer, many of them slammed the possibility of broad relief. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton, for example, wrote about the cost to taxpayers forgiving debt would have on Twitter: ""Why should those who didn't go to college or responsibly paid their loans be responsible for $13,000 in new debt?"" Utah Sen. Mitt Romney said broad relief would be a ""bribe"" to voters — an attempt by Democrats to win the midterm elections. Maine Sen. Susan Collins previously told Insider student-loan forgiveness is ""not fair"" to those who have already repaid their debt and argued people with higher incomes shouldn't qualify for the broad relief Biden is considering. But most Democrats want to see Biden enact broad student-loan relief for everyone, free of thresholds. ""Instead of continuously extending the pause under pressure,"" New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman recently tweeted, ""he needs to cancel all student loan debt.""

5/3/2022,"Life in the suburbs has never seemed more appealing. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the popularity of remote work, more and more Americans are choosing to leave the big city and move to smaller communities with larger homes, better schools, and a laid-back lifestyle. This, coupled with lower mortgage rates, has led to unprecedented demand for single-family homes in specific neighborhoods across the country, which, in turn, has driven home values to record highs. ""Coupland and Bear Creek, Texas, two small communities in the Austin metro area, have seen home values grow the fastest over the past year. Following closely behind are Hungry Horse and Whitefish, Montana, both of which are in the Kalispell area,"" said Nicole Bachaud, an economist with Zillow. But when it comes to the priciest suburb, the undisputed winner is the beachfront enclave of Montecito, California, where the median sale price this March was more than $5 million. For comparison, the median home value in California was $758,360, which was also the country's second-highest, according to data from Zillow. The state with the highest median home value was Hawaii, with $842,487, while the District of Columbia ranked third, with $703,116. But economists are finally starting to see signs of slowing down. As mortgage rates surpass 5%, online searches for homes on sale are down compared to this time last year, according to Redfin. ""In addition, we are seeing a fast-growing amount of sellers dropping their prices. These are all things that show a cooldown in the market after more than 18 months of a housing frenzy,"" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist. ""There's still way more demand for housing than supply, but these early signs of a slowdown indicate that sellers can no longer overprice their home.""
