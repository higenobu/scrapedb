4/14/2022,"The contours of the high-stakes legal battle between Johnny Depp and his former wife, Amber Heard, became clearer on Wednesday, as Depp’s older sister sought to refute Heard’s claims that her brother was a violent, unaccountable, childlike drug addict. Christi Dembrowski, who is also Depp’s personal manager, said she did not share Heard’s concerns – also advanced by a doctor who was treating Depp’s addiction to pain medication – that the actor was dependent on drugs and that he despaired of ever kicking his habit. Earlier, she had testified that her brother had sworn to never perpetrate domestic violence after he was a victim of it himself. But under questioning from Heard’s lawyers on Wednesday, Dembrowski conceded she had been concerned about the pain medication he was taking. Dembrowski also struggled on cross-examination when shown texts she had written to Heard soon after the couple returned from Australia, where, Depp has claimed, Heard severed his finger with a vodka bottle. “I love him so much but he needs help,” Dembrowski wrote. In a second text, she advised Heard to tell her husband: “I’m scared and I can’t deal.” Heard’s attorneys claimed that Depp was routinely late for work, including on one occasion being seven hours late on shoot-day on Disney’s Pirates 5 in Australia. Dembrowski, meanwhile, testified that he was pushed to complete a certain number of movies a year to keep his ex-agent’s income up, hinting that Depp and his ability to earn millions was part of a larger star ecosystem dependent on him. Dembrowski, 61, had earlier testified that Heard had referred to her husband as “an old, fat man” and was outraged when he, not her, was offered business with the French luxury house Dior. “They’re about class and style and you don’t have style,” Heard is alleged to have told her husband. The court in Fairfax, Virginia, also heard from Isaac Baruch, the former manager of Depp’s Viper Room club in Los Angeles, whom Depp set up in a penthouse apartment so he could paint. Depp was doing this as a friend, Baruch said, “as he has done for many other friends”. He testified that he had witnessed Depp and Heard argue twice, but never violently. “His family has been completely wrecked by all of this stuff, and it’s not fair,” Baruch said. “It’s not right, what she did. ... It’s insane.” Baruch, a scene-stealer in Hollywood terms with a forthright Brooklynese manner, said Heard was never anything but friendly to him. “I fell in love with her, just like Johnny fell in love with her. She was totally gracious, respectful, she had great teeth, and treated me with great respect, and humor – total locker-room, demented humor.” Baruch’s testimony was presented to illustrate Depp’s contention that his part in the marriage to Heard was peaceful and that his wife was the abusive party. Baruch testified that Heard had told him that her husband threw a phone at her and hit her inside the couple’s Los Angeles penthouse. He said he never noticed any evidence of abuse on Heard’s face. “I’m looking, and I inspect her face,” Baruch said of the alleged May 2016 incident. “And I don’t see anything. ... I don’t see a cut, a bruise, swelling, redness.” Two years after they broke up, Heard wrote a 2018 opinion article in the Washington Post that claimed she’d become “a public figure representing domestic abuse” – a libel against him, Depp claims, upon which the lawsuit is based. In a statement on Tuesday, Depp’s spokesperson said Heard’s account of abuse “follows a pattern of her elaborate, erroneous claims which have continued to change and evolve over time for the purpose of Hollywood shock value”. In 2016, Heard withdrew a petition for a restraining order against Depp and dismissed the domestic violence case against him. “Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,” they said in a joint statement following their divorce agreement. “Neither party has made false accusations for financial gains. There was never an intent of physical or emotional harm. Amber wishes the best for Johnny in the future.” Efforts by Dembrowski and Baruch to paint Depp as a mild, if troubled, man, are designed to counter devastating claims issued by Heard lawyers who contend that Depp’s career deteriorated as the result of his drinking and abuse of drugs – and that her Washington Post piece was not what had made him an unreliable commodity to the movie business. The court has been presented with Heard’s claims, part of a $100m counter-suit, that Depp physically and sexually abused his then wife during drug- and alcohol-fueled binges that turned him into a “monster”. Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, one of Heard’s lawyers, told the jury they would be shown graphic photographs. “They show bruises, they show cut lips, they show hair pulled out,” Bredehoft said. “They show two black eyes when he headbutted her.” “He has an enormous amount of rage,” Bredehoft added. “It’s during these rages that Mr Depp engaged in verbal, emotional, physical and sexual abuse of Amber.” Heard’s attorney’s have said the actor and L’Oréal model would always carry a makeup kit around with her to hide bruises. Under cross-examination on Wednesday, her lawyers made little headway with Baruch on whether he had ever witnessed Heard applying foundation, concealer or any other kind of makeup. Baruch did, however, testify that he had seen the Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, in the couple’s apartment. Musk is scheduled to be called by Heard’s defence team, who have already told the jury that “Johnny Depp is obsessed with Elon Musk”.",Arts/Film,"Johnny Depp was not violent drug addict, sister tells defamation trial",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/13/johnny-depp-amber-heard-defamation-trial-sister-christi-dembrowski

4/14/2022,"Chris Mason’s journey to the job of BBC political editor has been two decades of incremental promotions followed by a very rapid final ascent. Two weeks ago, he hadn’t even formally applied for the political editor role, according to individuals with knowledge of the process, because he had not expected to be in contention. But BBC bosses, suddenly concerned that he could become the latest big name to leave the national broadcaster for the private sector – having previously been wooed by Times Radio – suggested he might want to reconsider and reopened applications for his benefit. On Tuesday he was formally interviewed by senior management. And just 24 hours later Mason was announced to the world as the new political editor, succeeding Laura Kuenssberg and upending months of very public speculation over who would get the job – and beating the previous all-female shortlist in the process. Asked to sum up the appointment, one colleague said simply: “Nice guy gets job.” Internally, he is seen as the ultimate safe pair of hands – with both the pluses and minuses that entails – for a BBC news operation in transition. The nearest Mason has come to troubling the online news clickbait factories is when he said he had never watched an episode of Friends on an episode of the Brexitcast podcast. The most salacious detail offered up by one colleague was Mason’s unfortunate habit of leaving half-chewed carrots around the newsroom. “He’s basically been a 50-year-old man since he was a student,” said an individual who has known Mason since university. “But a genuinely lovely person and untouched by fame … Unlike some of his colleagues, I genuinely never hear a bad word about him.” Iain Dale, the former Conservative parliamentary candidate turned LBC presenter, said: “To this day I have no clue what his politics are, and that’s a great thing.” This could be because Mason started working for the corporation long before the social media age, joining its Newcastle newsroom in 2002 after a year at ITN. As a result, when pro-government researchers comb through the Twitter accounts of BBC journalists for evidence of political opinions, they have nothing to go on. Unlike other potential candidates for the job – such as the Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar or ITV’s Paul Brand – he has not recently broken stories that infuriated the government. The other side of this is that he is known more for being a broadcaster than an investigative journalist. Colleagues describe him as the sort of person who can keep an audience on side while filling time for hours in the rain outside Downing Street then rapidly explain what an announcement means. But he’s not known as the sort of person who regularly lands big exclusives. This perhaps raises wider questions – which the BBC struggles with internally – about what the role of their political journalism should be. The holder of the political editor job can still reach tens of millions of people a day with their broadcasts, articles, and blogs, giving them enormous power to shape public attitudes towards government policy. In turn, the holder has to navigate the enormous pressure that Downing Street puts on the corporation’s Westminster news operation. In recent years the BBC has come under scrutiny for whether it is getting the balance right between explaining the news through a Westminster lens and declaring what is really happening. As a child, Mason would watch ITN’s political editor Michael Brunson while attending the local state grammar school in Skipton. Although his father is a Dalesman, his mother is from Hull and he speaks with pride of his connections to the county, despite leaving to study geography at the University of Cambridge. He still ensures that every print copy of the local Craven Herald and Pioneer newspaper is posted down to his south-east London home. In a BBC that is constantly embarrassed about its lack of on-air regional accents, some parts of the corporation’s management have sometimes spoken about Mason’s Yorkshire accent as a prized curiosity rather than an unremarkable characteristic. When Dale interviewed Mason about his background for a podcast, the future BBC political editor made clear that he was never expected to join the media – but it was enthusiasm that had carried him to the top: “I don’t know where that passion for radio and news and politics and current affairs came from. There isn’t any journalistic or media heritage in the family. “My parents are both primary school teachers, my grandad was a builder. I got a little white radio when I was seven and just got obsessed with it.”",News/Media,The startling ascent of new BBC political editor Chris Mason,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/13/the-startling-ascent-of-new-bbc-political-editor-chris-mason
4/14/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article is for people watching Moon Knight on Disney+. Do not read unless you have seen episodes one to three. And so to episode three. Prior to the series starting, Disney made the first four episodes available to reviewers. Many claimed that this episode was where things went a little askew – Empire said this is where the plot became “nebulous and occasionally hard to follow” – and while I did share that view when I watched the first four episodes in one go, my opinion has changed since rewatching one a week in order to write these recaps. Maybe bingeing on a show hampers your enjoyment and understanding. We began with Layla getting a fake passport and confiding in the forger about how confused she is by her husband’s alter ego, Steven – while making reference to the dangers of going back to Egypt. Out in the field, Harrow and his acolytes celebrated the fact that they had found Ammit’s tomb, in a scene that could have come straight from Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. David Ganly as Billy even laughed like Sallah. During the rooftop fight, we saw Marc doing the scrapping and Steven in the reflection, then when Marc jumped out of the taxi and the thugs ran off looking scared, he said, “That wasn’t me.” Later, when he came to with a knife in his bloody hands, bodies all around him, he had no recollection of killing those men and neither did Steven. Who did it? Is Khonshu taking more direct control of his avatar, or is there a third ruthless personality we haven’t seen yet? The moment the thug fell to his death reminded me of a scene from The Spy Who Loved Me, only “Where’s Harrow?” was the twice-repeated question rather than “Where’s Fekkesh?” Khonshu’s signal of causing an eclipse prompted a meeting with the other Egyptian deities, the ones who banished him the last time they saw him. So Steven went inside the Great Pyramid of Giza with just an excited Marc for company and met his fellow avatars. Yatzil, the avatar of Hathor, the goddess of music and love, was friendlier than the others, even hinting at a romance between her boss and Khonshu once upon a time. We also learned that the gods had abandoned Earth, which explains why they didn’t intervene when Thanos decided to wipe out half of the universe’s population. (How many of future MCU plotlines will have to introduce narrative points to explain why entities with supreme powers didn’t step in to stop the mad Titan? First Eternals, now this.) Once accused, Harrow denied that he was hoping to resurrect Ammit, and that Khonshu – jealous, paranoid and unhinged – was not to be trusted, nor was his avatar, an unwell man who doesn’t know his own name. As if proving the charges levelled at him, Marc tried to strike Harrow. “We will not tolerate violence in this chamber,” was perhaps a deliberate nod to “You can’t fight in here, this is the War Room,” from Dr Strangelove, or perhaps it wasn’t and I just couldn’t take it seriously. Whichever, the trial was over and Khonshu/Marc/Steven left disappointed, but not before Hathor revealed that there was another way to find the tomb of Ammit. He must find Senfu’s sarcophagus, recently sold on the black market – Senfu being the only person to record the location of Ammit’s tomb. Given Harrow is nearby and has located Ammit’s tomb, would it not have been easier to track him down, rather than chase after the sarcophagus? Marc Spector is supposedly an expert tracker, and by this point had Layla to help him, not to mention the assistance of a god. While I enjoyed the episode, this seemed like a strange plot development. There is something about men who ride horses shirtless then slip on a silk robe, still sweaty from the mock jousting competition they’ve been staging in their palace compound while surrounded by henchmen, that makes me think “This guy seems like a baddie.” I was right – such instincts! Anton Mogart is clearly not a good person, and will be back to settle his obvious beef with Layla, if nothing else. Harrow, meanwhile, hinted at knowing the truth about the murder of Layla’s father, and Marc’s reaction to the topic suggested that he, too, knows exactly what happened. The fight scene in the compound gave us more of a glimpse of Moon Knight’s powers, and showed better cooperation between Marc and Steven when in their Moon Knight/Mr Knight guises. Finally, to the desert, where Steven came into his own and even won over Khonshu, who had previously described him as “the worm”. Khonshu turned back the hands of time to show the position of the stars 2,000 years ago, thereby angering the gods. Again, wouldn’t it have been easier just to find Harrow and steal back the scarab than reposition every star in the galaxy and have Khonshu locked in stone? Is Marc dead without Khonshu’s power, or merely unconscious? We left the episode with Harrow issuing a chilling warning to Khonshu’s statue, that he was going to do what Khonshu could not, but that he owed his victory to him and the torment he suffered while serving as Khonshu’s avatar. Episode four can’t come soon enough. Fans of Orange Is the New Black might have recognised the forger in the opening scene. That’s the British actor Barbara Rosenblat, seen sans hair as Miss Rosa in the prison drama. Meanwhile, Ann Akinjirin, who plays Bobbi, is best known for playing Alissa in I May Destroy You. The information on Layla’s passport states that she will be 28 on 28 October – the same birthday as the actor May Calamawy (although she is slightly older in real life). Given the issue date and expiry on the passport, it suggests she survived Thanos’s finger-snap. That said, this is a fake passport, so it could be all incorrect. One thing that is correct is the seven-year validity – that’s how long Egyptian passports last. That date of birth was the day Stargate was released in cinemas, which stars Kurt Russell and James Spader, and features a whole host of Egyptological imagery and references. Back to Moon Knight and in the scene with the other avatars, we see representatives of Hathor, Horus, Tefnut, Osiris and Isis. When Layla is greeted by Bek at Mogart’s yard, he mentions Madripoor. It’s a fictional island in south-east Asia seen extensively in X-Men comics and, more recently, as the place Power Broker operated in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier. At last, a tie-in to the wider MCU. What did you think? Were you confused? How will Marc free Khonshu and how will he manage without his Moon Knight powers?

4/14/2022,"The National Union of Students (NUS) is to open itself up to an independent investigation into allegations of antisemitism after a wave of complaints from Jewish students and interventions from former NUS presidents and senior political figures. The announcement was made after a crisis meeting on Wednesday of the NUS board, which issued a statement reiterating there could be no place for antisemitism within the student movement and promising to address any wrongdoing. “We are listening to the concerns being raised and we’re very concerned about the pain and hurt being expressed,” the statement said. “We will take any and all actions that are needed to remedy any wrongdoing and rebuild trust with Jewish students, as well as our members, partners and stakeholders.” The announcement came after more than 20 former NUS presidents, including three former cabinet ministers, sent an unprecedented private warning to the organisation’s trustees, urging them to address concerns from Jewish students. Among those who signed the letter, leaked to the Guardian, were the former cabinet ministers Jack Straw, Charles Clarke and Jim Murphy, the shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, and Labour peer Maeve Sherlock. “This is not just a matter of protecting NUS’s reputation, but honouring NUS’s proud anti-racist principles,” the letter said. The NUS said the investigation would cover all public allegations made about the NUS and its president-elect, Shaima Dallali, over the past two months – in particular, the decision to invite the rapper Lowkey to one of its events, as well as allegations of a wider culture of antisemitism within its ranks. “In relation to the president-elect, the independent investigation will look into a range of comments and actions that are alleged to have taken place over the last decade,” the NUS said. Complaints have been made by the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) about comments by Dallali on social media, including a post from when she was a young teenager, which read: “Khaybar Khaybar O Jews … Muhammad’s army will return Gaza,” referencing an AD628 massacre. She has since apologised for the post. In addition to the independent investigation, the NUS promised to meet regularly with the UJS to “hear concerns, receive input, and explore how we move forward together from here”. “We will be appointing a highly regarded independent party to undertake the investigation and we will be consulting with the UJS in making the appointment,” the NUS said. “Whoever is appointed must have the confidence of Jewish students.” The NUS added that it had adopted the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism in 2018 and that, in the recent past, it had acted on antisemitism, removing a member of the national council in 2018 and removing an election candidate in 2019 in line with policies on antisemitism. The chair of the Commons education committee, Robert Halfon, has called for the NUS to be investigated by the Charity Commission over the allegations. The NUS responded that it was not a charity and therefore not subject to such an investigation. “However, NUS willingly holds itself to the highest standards,” it added. Last week, the higher education minister, Michelle Donelan, warned that the government could suspend engagement with the union over the allegations. Donelan also called on student unions across the country to “consider disaffiliation, unless matters improve quickly”. The NUS responded: “We hope that this will not happen and that colleagues in government will be satisfied that we are taking swift and appropriate action to address the allegations.”",News/Education,National Union of Students to be investigated for antisemitism,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/13/national-union-students-investigated-antisemitism
4/14/2022,"My friend George Montague, who has died aged 98, was a gay rights campaigner known affectionately in Brighton as “the oldest gay in the village”. He even wrote a book of that title, published in 2014. He was a regular and popular participant in Brighton’s Pride parade, latterly riding his mobility scooter decked out with rainbow flags and banners. George was born in Hackney, east London, and brought up in Hitcham, Buckinghamshire, the son of Nellie (nee New) and George Montague. Both his parents worked on the Hitcham House country estate – his father as a gardener and his mother in the laundry. George left the village school in Taplow, near Maidenhead, at the age of 14 and embarked on an apprenticeship in pattern making with the Machine Pattern company in Slough. At the age of 18 he joined the RAF and served during the second world war in Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) as a PT and drill instructor, training aircrew. After the war he completed his apprenticeship and became a fully qualified pattern maker in 1949. Then he started his own business, Montague Pattern and Casting, and ran it for the next 47 years. George knew he was “different” from an early age, but the pressure to conform in postwar Britain, when homosexuality was illegal, led to his marriage in 1961 to his friend Vera Drye. They settled in Buckinghamshire, and had three children. In 1974 George was charged and convicted of gross indecency – a traumatic event that caused him to reappraise his the direction of his life. In 1976 he became smitten with sailing and set about building his own boat, Woody. Then in the early 1980s, after the death of his mother and with his children becoming adults, George and Vera parted. They never divorced and remained friends until her death in 2001. I first met George in 1982 when he joined the Sailing and Cruising Association, a national LGTBQ+ sailing group. George quickly became an active member of the club. Many cross-Channel trips to France followed from his base in Brighton marina, as well numerous trips along the south coast. Although Woody was sold in 2000, George remained a member of the club for the rest of his life. In 1997 George retired from his business. In the same year he met Somchai Phukkhlai, and in 2001 they set up home in an apartment on Brighton sea front. George was determined to heal the injustice of the past. When, in 2016, the government pardoned gay and bisexual men who had been convicted under historical anti-gay laws, this was not good enough for George, who believed that a pardon implied guilt. He drew up a petition calling for an apology, which he delivered to 10 Downing Street. Eventually, in 2017, George received a full apology from the Home Office, in a letter that said the treatment of George and others had been entirely unfair and was “a matter of the greatest regret”. George and Somchai became civil partners in 2006 and married in 2015. George is survived by Somchai, his daughter, Paula, his sons, Martin and Edward, and three grandchildren.",News/World news,George Montague obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/13/george-montague-obituary
4/14/2022,"The main problem with The First Lady, the Showtime series focused on three past presidents’ wives – Michelle Obama (Viola Davis), Betty Ford (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Eleanor Roosevelt (Gillian Anderson) – is evident in the first few seconds. The pilot, directed by The Night Manager’s Susanne Bier, opens with a camera flash sometime in the late 2010s. Michelle Obama sits for a photoshoot by the portraitist Amy Sherald in a pose familiar to most Americans – long, flowing gown with a geometric print, hair in loose waves, chin resting on the back of her hand. Asked by Obama why she didn’t want to paint her husband’s portrait, Sherald responds: “I don’t want to just paint the official. I am in interested in the real.” That “real” is doing a lot of heavy lifting, both here and over the course of 10 episodes that struggle to find anything interesting, thorny, complicated – one might say authentic – under history-class pull-quotes, chaotic timeline shifts and ill-fitting accents. There’s the difficulty of narrativizing real events, particularly the very recent history portrayed by the Obama third of the show. The 2018 Sherald portrait is classic Obama iconography – stately yet inviting, intellectual, a delicate balance. That balance is off in The First Lady; as any viewer knows, it is not Michelle Obama in this famous pose but an actor pretzeling herself into the role. Suspension of disbelief is difficult when the character is a well-known figure, and nearly impossible with one as publicly vibrant, oft-photographed, and still relevant as Michelle Obama. It’s an awkward fit from the jump, and perhaps the best example of a recent-history performance that’s simply too soon. Then there’s the issue of the show’s intent to offer a “revelatory reframing of American leadership” through the lens of three first ladies, to cast their personal struggles and triumphs – Roosevelt’s independent thinking in a man’s world, Ford’s groundbreaking candor on addiction and cancer, Obama’s resilience in the face of persistent racism – as historical anchors. There is absolutely a noble intent here to recenter women too often pushed to the margins of history, even with immense privilege. But noble intent in the name of women, even Obama, cannot recuse a series from cringeworthy dialogue, scrambled pacing and parody-level performances (Kiefer Sutherland as FDR is particularly bad; watching anyone play Barack Obama at this point feels like a less effective Key & Peele sketch, and this applies to O-T Fagbenle and Julian De Niro as older and younger Baracks). The series, created by Aaron Cooley and executive-produced by Davis, toggles between melodramatic historical soap (for the early Roosevelt days, it’s The Gilded Age without any humor) and staid hagiography. Think a sanded down, flat version of Mrs America, the FX-on-Hulu limited series on the 1970s fight over the equal rights amendment that also spanned multiple timelines and an all-star female cast while adding new depth to famous real-life figures. It’s a shame, because the cast is unreasonably good for a show to be this much of a drag. To name a few actors under-served by this disappointing show besides Anderson, Pfeiffer and most especially Davis: Ellen Burstyn, as FDR’s overbearing socialite mother; Sharp Objects’s Eliza Scanlen as a young Eleanor, somehow with scenes only 15 years apart from an aged-up Anderson’s; Aaron Eckhart as Gerald Ford, little more than a distracted but devoted husband to Betty; Dakota Fanning as their daughter, Susan; Regina Taylor as Michelle’s mother, Marian; Jayme Lawson as young Michelle; and Kristine Froseth as young Betty. Davis is undoubtedly a national treasure, and her intent here seems spiritually aligned with both Obama the icon and Obama the real person, but the performance, especially against Fagbenle’s spottily accented Barack, is unsettling, never transcending the uncanniness of impersonation. If there is a bright spot to The First Lady, it’s the attention paid to Betty Ford, the least known and least politically ambitious of the three. Though hemmed in by bold underlining of themes (Betty waves around a copy of the Feminine Mystique, because the 1960s), the Ford third at least hints at a woman with a real personality beneath all the famous references. Pfeiffer’s Ford is vulnerable, flawed, and fascinatingly uncalculated in public, though that performance is scattered among flashbacks and potentially complex dynamics – her friendship with her Black housekeeper, Clara, for example – reduced to a few conversations. Such is the standard for The First Lady. You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here.
