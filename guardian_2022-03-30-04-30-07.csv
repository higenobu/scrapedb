3/30/2022,"Free Covid testing will end for most people in England from Friday, ministers have confirmed, meaning most people who want to know if they are infected will have to pay for a test, whether they have symptoms or not. Details of the new testing regime, released in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday, reveal that from 1 April, free symptomatic testing will be available only to hospital patients when it is required for their care and to people living or working in “high-risk settings”, such as care homes and prisons. Symptomatic testing will also continue to be provided to those already eligible for Covid-19 treatments in the community because they are at higher risk of becoming seriously ill if they contract the virus. Free asymptomatic testing will only be provided to people in particularly high-risk settings, such as care home staff and patient-facing staff in the NHS, and only when prevalence is high and there is a risk an infection will spread rapidly. The shift is part of the UK government’s plan to “live with Covid”, which argues that it is time to manage the virus as we do other infectious diseases such as flu. It means free testing for Covid should be for those in at-risk groups. However, scientists have warned that slashing access to free lateral flow and PCR tests could put vulnerable people at risk and undermine efforts to understand the virus. Announcing the change, the government noted that more than 55% of people currently in hospital who have tested positive are not there with Covid as a primary diagnosis, although experts say current infection rates are still causing problems including staff absences and delays to services. Charities have also raised concerns about the move, with the Alzheimer’s Society having warned that care home visitors may have to pay about £73 a month – a sum it described as “a cruel tax on care”. Welcoming this announcement, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, welcomed the announcement. “Health leaders will be relieved that the government has seen sense and confirmed at the eleventh hour that NHS staff in patient-facing roles will continue to have access to free testing against Covid-19. This is a victory for common sense,” he said. “As rates of coronavirus and hospital admissions continue to be high and with one in 16 people in England believed to have the virus currently, stripping this access from those who care for some of the most vulnerable in our society would have been a massive error. Christina Pagel, professor of operational research at University College London, said: “The government praise public understanding about how to manage the risk of Covid, but knowledge is only helpful if you can do something with it. “With the ever worsening cost of living crisis, millions will not be able to afford to test themselves if they have symptoms or before visiting vulnerable people. With one of the lowest sick pay rates in Europe, millions will not be able to follow government advice to stay home if sick. “With record infections and rising hospital admissions, this is not the time to remove free access to one of the most fundamental public health tools.” Lateral flow tests are already available to buy on the high street, with Boots announcing in February that it will sell the devices at £2.50 for one or £12 for a pack of five. Those who wish to have the option of sending their results to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) can pay £17 for a pack of four tests. The announcement comes at a time when Covid infections are once again rife. According to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), infection levels are at a record high in Scotland and about one in 16 people in England had Covid in the week ending 19 March, compared with one in 20 the week before, a rise from about 2,653,200 to 3,485,700 people. The number of Covid patients in hospital is also rising, with some NHS trusts having suspended visiting as a result. The secretary of state for health and social care, Sajid Javid, said: “Thanks to our plan to tackle Covid we are leading the way in learning to live with the virus. “We have made enormous progress but will keep the ability to respond to future threats including potential variants. “Vaccines remain our best defence and we are now offering spring boosters to the elderly, care home residents and the most vulnerable – please come forward to protect yourself, your family and your community.” The government also announced that free parking for NHS staff working in hospitals in England will end on Friday. Parking fees were waived during the pandemic, but Javid said that the benefit would end this week.",News/World news,Free Covid tests to end for most people in England on Friday,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/free-covid-tests-to-end-for-most-people-in-england-on-friday
3/30/2022,"Sipping on a tulip-shaped glass of Turkish black tea, Roman Abramovich sat on the sunlit terrace of Istanbul’s Shangri-La hotel on Tuesday afternoon and talked intently with the Ukrainian negotiating team. Despite the seafood and burger restaurant’s extensive menu and large fridge advertising its stock of dry-aged meat, the Russian oligarch did not appear to eat during the entire meeting. Less than 24 hours had passed since he was reported to have suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning. Abramovich has emerged as an unofficial channel to Russian president Vladimir Putin. He was present on Tuesday at both the formal Turkey-hosted morning talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators at Istanbul’s Dolmabahçe Palace and the informal huddle at the adjacent Shangri-La in the afternoon. At the hotel, the billionaire former Chelsea owner sat and talked with Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov, who was also reported to have suffered symptoms after their previous series of unofficial talks. Abramovich, who was surrounded by heavy security, leaned in to talk with Umerov, later joined by Ukrainian parliamentary leader and head of the delegation David Arakhamia. The rest of the Ukrainian delegation – including the defence minister, Olekseii Reznikov, wearing military green – were seated at the far end of the terrace, and later got up to reveal a forest of half-empty wine glasses. The restaurant’s long terrace overlooks the Bosphorus and the adjacent bustling Beşiktaş ferry stop, with travellers hurrying past seemingly unaware of their proximity to the group or their furtive negotiations. Russia has denied any poisoning plot, and the claims remain murky. Umerov himself has since said he was “fine” and called on people not to trust “unverified information”. However, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told Ukraine’s Channel 24 television prior to the meeting: “I advise anyone going through negotiations with the Russian Federation not to eat or drink anything, and preferably avoid touching any surface.” At the earlier official meeting at the palace, some progress appears to have been made. Despite the difficulties of the talks, the results appeared warmer and more productive than previous sessions in Belarus or talks between the Russian and Ukrainian foreign ministers in the southern Turkish city of Antalya. The delegations conducted delicate negotiations facing one another at a long conference table inside a stone-walled room, with pictures of the meeting showing Abramovich seated at a small nearby table alongside the Turkish presidential spokesperson, İbrahim Kalın. The discussions followed a short opening speech by the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who addressed them from a lectern, saying: “the world is waiting for good news, and good news from you.” The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, told a press conference that “we see with satisfaction that both sides are getting closer at every stage”. He expressed hopes that the foreign ministers and later perhaps even the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Putin would meet. Later at the hotel, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, resisted further questions from journalists and disappeared from view under the crystal chandeliers in the hotel lobby. After talking on the terrace, many from the Ukrainian delegation moved into the restaurant’s interior away from public view, to a large table laden with food. Once inside, Abramovich peeled off to sit on a plush sofa alone to make a phone call, accompanied only by his glass of tea. He later followed Umerov and other members of the Ukrainian delegation, clutching stuffed blue binders, to another area of the restaurant to continue their discussions well into the late afternoon, hours after the official talks had ended. Outside, under the bright lobby lights, a Ukrainian general strolled across the marble floor past an accompanying diplomat, who fell asleep in an armchair while clutching a briefcase, exhausted from the day’s events.",News/World news,‘The world is waiting for good news’: Russia-Ukraine peace talks press on in Turkey ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/the-world-is-waiting-for-good-news-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-press-on-in-turkey
3/30/2022,"The denial was near total. You’d have thought that Boris Johnson would have had plenty of time to prepare a response to the Metropolitan police’s decision to issue the first bang-to-rights 20 fixed-penalty notices. After all, they can hardly have come as a surprise. Only it seems that everything is a surprise to the Suspect – or the Criminal as we may soon have to call him – these days. So much so that he’s still not sure if he actually went to a party during lockdown even though the police have concluded that loads of people did. Even now he’s swearing blind that no one did anything wrong in No 10. The police must have made a mistake. If it wasn’t already before, it really is now one rule for him and another for the rest of us. Imagine the scale of the delusion. It had been a lovely sunny day and “Party Marty”, aka Martin Reynolds, had suggested that the Downing Street staff get a bit pissed together in the garden after work. Just to cheer everyone up a bit and to thank them for all their hard work. And he had even been sure to ask everyone to bring their own booze because he had been thoughtful enough to remember that the Suspect was quite mean and didn’t want to have to pay for people to get trashed. Party Marty had even sent around an email confirming all the details. But for some reason Boris had not only failed to read the email, he had totally forgotten there had been a party arranged for that evening. So when he had wandered outside with Carrie, he had been totally baffled to discover the garden of No 10 full of people, along with trestle tables weighed down with food and drink. Obviously he had been too polite to ask what everyone was doing there, so he just went along with it. As you do. And it goes without saying that it had also completely slipped the Suspect’s mind that he had introduced legislation preventing people socialising and that parties were illegal. Now it gets positively spooky. Because the same thing kept happening time and time again and each time the prime minister forgot about the pandemic. There were at least 12 parties in Downing Street – Johnson attended at least six of them – and the Suspect was somehow convinced that no parties had ever taken place. And, bizarrely, still is. Despite the police having now concluded the first stage of the investigations and found the law had repeatedly been broken at No 10, Boris is still adamant that he had only ever attended work events. It was totally normal for staff to get roaring drunk, break the toddler’s swing and toss the empties into the flower bed at pandemic planning meetings. What happened in No 10, stayed in No 10. And that also went for the fixed-penalty notices. Anyone who got fined would not be obliged to resign or even admit they had broken the law. This was government as the wild west. No wonder then that Labour have become ever more inclined not to take the prime minister at his word. If the police don’t feel they can trust him, why should anyone else? Either the Suspect is a lying, narcissistic sociopath who has no idea of the boundaries between right or wrong, or he’s out of his head on psychotropic drugs and is living in a parallel, hallucinatory universe. Or both possibly. So Angela Rayner turned an opposition day debate into a humble address to force the government into releasing information about the appointment of Evgeny Lebedev to the Lords. Just to make sure there was no wrongdoing. You could sense that Rayner would rather have been letting rip about the FPNs and Johnson having lied to parliament than debating Lebedev, but the Commons had been warned not to stray off topic – even to join the dots about the prime minister’s lack of judgment – so Labour’s deputy leader stuck to her brief. Her request was simple. The Guardian and Sunday Times reported that the intelligence services had originally recommended Lebedev as unsuitable for a peerage. Indeed the head of MI6 had even refused to have lunch with the oligarch. So Rayner just wanted to check whether their concerns were genuine and the Suspect had doctored their recommendations in forcing the Lords’ appointments committee to change its mind. Or whether Johnson was just shallow, venal and corrupt and wanted to reward someone who invited him to flash parties – the lengths he might have gone to drop his security detail after the Nato meeting to get trashed in Lebedev’s castle in Italy – and gave him good coverage in the Evening Standard. As for Lebedev, was he in hock to Putin like his dad or was he just a spoilt airhead? As so often, it fell to paymaster general, Michael Ellis, to defend the indefensible in the Commons. Fortunately, Ellis has no sense of self-worth and will say almost anything to advance his own career. Though this time he was almost on his own as many of the rest of the Tory backbenchers had decided – after the Owen Paterson lobbying fiasco – that it wasn’t a good look to be seen to be trying to cover up possible wrongdoing and had said they would vote with Labour. If there was dirt on Lebedev, then so be it. And if there wasn’t, then there was no harm in making the details of his appointment public. Weirdly, there are some Tories who feel the probity of the prime minister still matters. Ellis tried to make the case that even the Suspect had given up on. There was nothing remotely abnormal about Lebedev becoming a peer, he said sotto voce. If the prime minister’s brother and Zac Goldsmith could become Lords then anyone could. Perhaps one day, even Ellis himself might reach such heights. He could dream. Lebedev had just been your everyday billionaire who had taken pity on a down-on-his-luck London mayor and backed him through thick and thin. The intelligence services were just guilty of Russophobia in turning him down. It didn’t help that Lebedev was busy tweeting that it was an outrage the Commons was debating his peerage. You can take the boy out of the Kremlin but you can’t take the Kremlin out of the boy. Only two Tory MPs bothered to speak up for Ellis and for the rest of the debate he cut a lone figure. Just waiting for the moment his own party chose not to vote with him at the division. Like so much of his life, his contribution had been entirely pointless. Though Ellis wan’t the only one to stick up for the Suspect’s inherent honesty and magnificence. Over on the BBC, Matt Hancock, whose skin-crawling neediness is in a league of its own, was saying that he didn’t care if Boris had lied or broken the rules. Johnson was the right person to be leading the country regardless. Just gizza job. Or a peerage.

3/30/2022,"The French president Emmanuel Macron is aiming to kickstart his re-election campaign this week with walkabouts outside Paris and a big rally in the capital, after the diplomatic pressures of the war in Ukraine limited his canvassing at home – leading to a dip in the polls and worries of a low turn-out. Macron, 44, is hoping next month to be the first French president to win re-election in 20 years, but he has recently dropped two to three points in the polls as the gap between him and the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen narrows. While he remains favourite the next 10 days of campaigning are seen as fraught and risky amid anger over the cost of living, disillusionment with the level of campaign debate and politics in general. “I adore rallies – but let’s be clear-headed: I can’t do many!” Macron recently said on TV, explaining that he had instead been at international summits and engaged in diplomacy on Ukraine. “No one would understand if I wasn’t there to protect the French.” Macron, after sweeping to power in 2017 promising to transform France with a new brand of politics that was neither left nor right, is polling at about 27% in the first round, followed by Le Pen on about 17%. Le Pen is gaining ground after campaigning hard on France’s cost of living crisis. But if Macron faces Le Pen in the final round runoff on 24 April, the result is predicted to be much closer than when he won five years ago with 66%, with one poll this week putting Macron at 53% to Le Pen’s 47%. A third candidate, the hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon, is also steadily rising, and abstention could be as high as 30%. Of those who say they will vote, four in 10 are still not sure for whom – adding to a greater degree of unpredictability. Most French voters trust Macron to lead on the issue of war in Ukraine, which initially appeared to cement his position, and at campaign events will regularly says he’s off to speak to a world leader on the phone straight afterwards. His presidential rivals on the right and left however accuse him of ducking the political debate at home. When Macron rolled up his shirtsleeves and went for his first walkabout to meet the public in Burgundy this week, he was met by complaints about fuel prices, the cost of living and shouts of “We’re taxed all year round!”. He said France had spent €20bn (£17bn) in measures to help those who were struggling and “France has done more than its neighbours”. Macron’s challenge in the coming days is to drum up enthusiasm for his election platform. Polls show that the manifesto details that have stuck in voters minds are his measures on the right – raising the retirement age to 65 and requiring unemployed people to undertake 15 to 20 hours of work or training a week. Macron’s support on the centre-left – which was crucial for his election in 2017 – has dipped, while his support on the centre-right has risen. But after promising novelty and fresh ideas at the last presidential election, a recent Elabe poll found that, this time, fewer than one in five people thought Macron’s programme was innovative. Analysts say Macron – whose early labour and tax reforms saw him labelled “president of the rich” – must show he is listening to people on the ground, and their concerns. On a recent local radio phone-in, one woman working in the health service told Macron she felt he “wasn’t there for us”. Afterwards, in a behind-the-scenes video for his campaign, he lamented that she felt that way saying he’d heard the same kind of comment “in lots of places”. Opposition figures, including Le Pen, Mélenchon and the far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour, have attacked Macron over a senate report that French ministries have more than doubled spending on international consultancy firms, including the US firm McKinsey, between 2018 and last year. Macron’s government has been accused of paying millions for advice on what was criticised as a slow rollout of Covid vaccines. The Green party candidate, Yannick Jadot, called it indecent to pay private consultants. Macron said all contracts respected the rules. Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant at the pollsters Viavoice, said Macron’s current polling remained higher than his first-round score five years ago of 24%. Chau said Macron faced a challenge: “The international crisis has allowed him to rest on his presidential stature and legitimacy on the world stage. But, in the tight time-frame of the campaign, he still has to create an effect of ‘desirability’ among voters. He has to both say ‘I’m the right person for the current international context’ and at the same time elicit some positive emotion from voters, with proposals seen as improving people’s lives. That double situation is not easy.”",News/World news,Macron kickstarts re-election campaign as Le Pen gains ground,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/macron-kickstarts-re-election-campaign-as-le-pen-gains-ground
3/30/2022,"Jackie Weaver – if you recall the dialogue from the jaw-droppingly chaotic parish council meeting – had “no authority” to remove councillors from the meeting. “No authority at all.” More than a year on, newly published independent investigation reports have revealed the complainants were correct: the muting of microphones and removal of individual councillors “was without authority”. Weaver, it seems, did not have the authority to do what she did. But the report also has considerable sympathy for Weaver’s situation. Its author writes: “Faced with what were unusual and difficult circumstances, and the deep-seated issues underpinning those circumstances, we can understand why JW [Weaver] acted as she did, despite her action being without any formal footing in terms of appropriate process and procedure.” The Handforth parish council zoom meeting of December 2020 was one of the internet sensations of lockdown, shared by millions across the world. Weaver, employed by the Cheshire Association of Local Councils, had been brought in to help run the parish council meeting amid accusations of poor councillor behaviour. The low-quality footage shows Weaver being told by the council chair that he was the only one who could remove people from the meeting. “You have no authority here Jackie Weaver. No authority at all.” Soon after, he was removed. Another councillor urged Weaver to read the standing orders, yelling: “Read them and understand them.” Other councillors could be heard muttering under their breath. One gets up to answer the door. Some struggled with their mute button. In the background was the sound of a flushing toilet. The viral success of the meeting led to T-shirts being made that read: “You have no authority here Jackie Weaver.” Weaver herself published a self-help book titled “You Do Have the Authority Here!” The chaos led to six independent investigation reports into councillor misconduct that were published in May 2021, but not publicly released. The audit and governance committee of Cheshire East council agreed this year that those reports should be published. The six reports investigating multiple complaints run to 146 pages in total and are dizzying in their detail of local government process. Three of the reports focus on the infamous meeting. It emerged earlier this month that the formal investigations into Handforth councillor behaviour had cost Cheshire East council more than £85,000. Reacting to the reports Weaver told the BBC that she felt the jury was still out on precise procedure. “We were still very vague about how virtual council meetings worked and I did not actually remove them from the meeting, in my opinion, I moved them to the waiting room,” she said. “A little later in the meeting the remaining councillors voted to remove them. “So I welcome the findings of the report but am deeply saddened that it took so long and cost so much to get there.”",News/Society,"Jackie Weaver had ‘no authority’ after all, investigation finds",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/29/jackie-weaver-had-no-authority-after-all-investigation-finds
3/30/2022,"Prince Andrew has long been known as the Queen’s favourite son – which may help explain why she wanted him by her side at the Duke of Edinburgh’s memorial service six weeks after he reached a multimillion-dollar settlement with a woman who accused him of sex assault when she was 17. But Andrew may be hoping other elements of his reputation have a lot less sticking power. Last month, he announced that although he denied all allegations of sexual abuse, his friendship with the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein made continuing his royal duties untenable. He later agreed a settlement, thought to be well over $10m (£6.5m), with his accuser, Virginia Giuffre. It was widely suggested he might never be seen in public life again. His appearance in a prominent role alongside the Queen at his father’s service on Tuesday may have been to mark close family bereavement but it sparked concerns about the royal family’s judgment and the message it sent to survivors of abuse. Lisa Bloom, a lawyer representing eight Epstein victims, said Andrew’s appearance showed there was “zero evidence” he was living up to his public promise to demonstrate his regret over Guiffre’s case by “supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims”. She said: “We are watching. We are waiting. As he resumes public appearances, it appears that, like his promise to cooperate with law enforcement, this will be yet another broken promise.” Hera Hussain, a sexual abuse campaigner who founded the Chayn charity, said it was important Andrew withdrew from public life since “his presence is a painful reminder to survivors everywhere about how powerful men are able to absolve themselves from their conduct and use public appearances to rebuild their image”. But Ann Olivarius, the senior partner of the McAllister Olivarius law firm, who has acted in sex abuse cases on both sides of the Atlantic, said Andrew’s appearance was clearly “as a son, in memory of his father”. Survivors, including Giuffre, could take comfort in the fact he appeared as “a much-diminished prince, stripped of his royal patronages who has lost thoroughly in the court of public opinion”, she said. Andrew’s appearance has prompted speculation over whether it was likely to be a one-off given the significance of the family occasion – or if he was testing the water to establish in what capacity he could return to public life. Mark Borkowski, a PR and royal commentator, said the latter would be consistent with the combination of “hubris and arrogance” and poor judgment that Andrew had demonstrated in the past, as shown in his friendship with Epstein and his “car crash” BBC Newsnight interview. “Make no mistake, Andrew would be determined to come back into public life.” He added that the decision to give the prince a prominent role reflected the Queen’s loyalty. However, he questioned her judgment given the difficult year the royals have had after Meghan and Harry’s departure and, more recently, the controversy over the monarchy’s legacy of colonialism following William and Kate’s trip to the Caribbean. “If this is her gesture, it’s a colossal mistake if they’re using a memorial service to rehabilitate this soiled royal,” he said.With the Downing Street Partygate scandal returning to the news on the same day as Andrew’s reappearance, Borkowski said the decision to put the prince front and centre raised broader questions about how long the damage of scandal lasted in an era of fast-moving news cycles.He said: “Do stories move on that quickly? Do we forget about them? I really don’t think memories are short enough to allow that.”",News/UK news,Was Prince Andrew’s role at service a bid to rehabilitate ‘soiled royal’?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/29/was-prince-andrews-role-at-service-a-bid-to-rehabilitate-soiled-royal
3/30/2022,"The architect Christopher Alexander, who has died aged 85, saw buildings and cities as living frameworks for human beings. Through designing, building, teaching and writing, he sought “to provide a complete working alternative to our present ideas about architecture, building and planning”. Like many critics of postwar reconstruction, he saw much that was destructive of community and incapable of elevating the human spirit, and set about a systematic approach to making buildings in which people could feel at home. He wanted to identify the order that lies behind beauty and meaning in the built world, and then learn, as an architect and builder, how to make it. I knew him as a teacher, colleague and mentor. A housing project in the barrios of Lima, the capital of Peru, in 1969 began with his team living for five weeks with different families on site, observing the details of daily life, to develop a what he called a “pattern language” of 67 principles that formed the basis for the design. In a housing project in Mexico in 1975-76 built with steel-reinforced soil-cement blocks and roof vaults of lightweight concrete, families laid out their own houses on the site, and participated in their construction, developing details as the work proceeded. This direct and detailed involvement of both architect and client served to promote a more accurate outcome. His approach provided the basis of an architecture bestseller, A Pattern Language (1977). Each of 253 “patterns”, with its own number, describes a helpful relationship between parts of the environment, and consists of a title – such as Public Outdoor Room, South Facing Outdoors or Windows Overlooking Life – explanatory text, diagrams and photographs. The patterns are linked to each other in a network structure, which gave the book an appeal to the software developers among its general readership. More and larger projects followed – a marketplace and a shelter for homeless people in San Jose, California (1990), the West Dean visitors’ centre in West Sussex (1994-96), an apartment building in Tokyo (1988), a series of houses in California and Washington state, and many others. In them, Chris tried to achieve buildings that are alive and at peace with themselves, what he called “the quality without a name”, as described in his book The Timeless Way of Building (1979). He developed detailed understandings of places, activities and forms at a range of scales and in relationship to each other, and his projects always incorporated construction innovations, ranging from walls made with interlocking soil-cement blocks laid without mortar, to walls made with local flint along with concrete and brick, to digital techniques that aided the design of large timber-framed buildings in Japan. Many of Chris’s sources came from traditional and vernacular buildings, leading some people to see him as old-fashioned or nostalgic. But to him, those buildings were not to be copied, but used to bring to light principles of order that he saw as lacking in contemporary architecture. His was not a reaction against style, but a recognition of the recurrent structure of beautiful buildings and places. His collection of old Turkish carpets contributed to his last major set of books, The Nature of Order (four volumes, 2002-04). Perhaps his most significant project was the Eishin high school, outside Tokyo, designed and built in the early 1980s. A months-long process of involvement with the school’s teachers, staff and students resulted in a project-specific pattern language addressing the several dozen features of the school that the clients saw as most important. Working on the site itself transformed that idealised picture into something that took advantage of the site’s hills and water, while maintaining the essence of the core ideas. And the process of making it brought together Chris’s team with that of a large construction company, working with local craftsmen who did much of the carpentry and the shikkui plaster on the walls of the buildings. The project won awards and was enjoyed by the teachers and students. The buildings and gardens have a strong sense of place, and much of the quality of traditional Japanese building. But it was also large and complex enough to reveal incompletely answered questions: how to reconcile a highly interactive process of design and building, attentive to the emerging feeling of the place, with the practicalities of budget, timeline and the norms of construction. Nonetheless it represents a major achievement. It incorporated the earlier idea of pattern languages as a way of being explicit about human needs in the environment with a later, more inclusive set of ideas about beauty and wholeness – ideas that indeed stretched beyond architecture to the sciences, particularly biology and cosmology. Born Wolfgang Christian Johann Alexander in Vienna, Austria, Chris was the son of Lilly (nee Deutsch) and Ferdinand Alexander, both classical archaeologists. In 1938 Nazi Germany annexed Austria, and the family moved to Britain. Chris’s father told him that if he wanted to study architecture, he first needed to study something more intellectually rigorous. So he took degrees in mathematics and architecture at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in 1958 went to Harvard University, where he took the first PhD in architecture awarded there. In 1963 he was appointed to the architecture faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, and remained there until returning to Britain early in the new century. To many architects and faculty colleagues at Berkeley, Chris violated the conventional wisdom that beauty is subjective and to talk about it is overly sentimental. Working with him was not always easy, but the fact that everyone’s comments were always taken seriously helped make the effort worthwhile. Chris realised that the smallest hint of unease about an idea might be the sign of something important. The office that he founded in 1967, the Center for Environmental Structure, was always small, with a half dozen or so people. Projects were taken up for the opportunity to experiment and advance the theoretical work rather than to maintain cashflow. Chris saw his most important role as that of a writer, and in an age of upheaval his ideas of simple beauty and the need to support the basic humanity of people may become even more influential. In 1980 he married Pamela Patrick, and they had two daughters, Lily and Sophie. The marriage ended in divorce in 2007, and the following year he married Maggie Moore. She and his daughters survive him.

3/30/2022,"A legendary nursery school that has been called the world’s most famous children’s centre and was a blueprint for Sure Start has been saved from immediate closure after an 11th hour U-turn by Tory councillors in the face of widespread public opposition. North Northamptonshire council dramatically announced midway through a packed and emotional public meeting on Tuesday that it would use £650k of reserves to keep the trailblazing Pen Green nursery in Corby and three other state-run nurseries afloat. The council had come under fire from local parents and early years experts who accused it of “levelling down” and being “out of touch” with reality after it proposed to axe £520,000 from Pen Green to prop up the three other cash-starved nurseries. The proposed cuts to Pen Green have become a potent symbol of the government’s alleged neglect of early years services, where more than 1,000 children’s centres have closed over the past decade, and of its failure, in a heavily leave-voting and economically deprived patch of Northamptonshire, to walk its levelling-up talk. Just minutes before the U-turn councillors had been warning financial help was impossible. But the last-minute change of heart was welcomed by Pen Green, though it warned its share of the new funds would still leave it £175k out of pocket, lead to service cuts and not address longer-term funding issues. “They are still levelling down, and there is still no recognition of the importance of our unique integrated services. We are still losing out financially, and while it is great news the other three nurseries are saved, we are still very much in danger,” said Angela Prodger, Pen Green’s joint director. Jason Smithers, the leader of North Northamptonshire council said: “We have seen and heard passion and commitment from all of our nurseries and their advocates … I fully understand the strength of feeling regarding the funding for our maintained nursery schools in North Northamptonshire.” Helen Hayes MP, the Shadow Minister for Children and Early Years, said: “Parents will be pleased and relieved to hear that Pen Green’s immediate future is secured. But this last-minute U-turn illustrates the continual uncertainty faced by nurseries and families. Across the country, thousands of childcare providers are facing a similar cliff edge after a decade of neglect from Conservative governments, making childcare increasingly unavailable and unaffordable for families.” The council said the funding – the three other nurseries, which do not offer wider integrated services were given £100,000 each – was temporary to allow the nurseries “time to adapt”, suggesting that unless there was a boost in the overall funding, Pen Green could find itself in a similar position in a year’s time. Pen Green is a world-leading model of integrated early years care, bringing together high-quality nursery, health, family support and social care services under one roof to provide the best possible start for families in a deprived former steel town scarred by poverty, ill-health and poor educational outcomes. More than 1,000 children a year pass through its many services, it trains thousands of childcare and family workers and spawned a thriving internationally renowned research centre. Hundreds of people visit each year from all over the world, from Auckland to Bologna, Glasgow to Kazakhstan. It is also treasured locally for its everyday successes: reaching out to struggling young parents and families and providing them with wrap-around support, getting their lives on track. A number of parents made emotional speeches to the council meeting about how it had rescued them and their children from despair. A statement was read out at the council meeting from Tess McQuade, headteacher at Prior’s Hall, a Corby primary school. In it, she recalled how she had gone to Pen Green for support as a 17-year-old with twins born 11 weeks early. It helped her negotiate not only an abusive relationship but gave her space to return to her studies. “Without Pen Green I would not be where I am today,” her testimony said. It added: “I can honestly say that the wonderful advocates who work at Pen Green Centre gave me strength and support when I was in need of it most.” As one Pen Green parent told the Guardian, ultimately a Tory-run council was proposing to drastically cut the budget of Pen Green, slap bang in the county’s most deprived area, to prop up three nurseries elsewhere. “If you cut the centre’s funding, it is not levelling up – it’s levelling down.” The latest threat to Pen Green – there have been several – will have reminded politicians in this currently Tory-held marginal parliamentary seat of the deep affection of local people for its famous nursery. One said: “It [Pen Green] is a family. It’s like your nan’s house on a Sunday. You know it is always there for you.”",News/Education,Influential Pen Green children’s centre saved from closure after council U-turn,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/29/influential-pen-green-childrens-centre-saved-from-closure-after-council-u-turn
