3/29/2022,"By Hilmar Gudmundsson, Adrian Jenkins, and Bertie Miles East Antarctica’s Conger ice shelf—a floating platform the size of Rome—broke off the continent on March 15, 2022. Since the beginning of satellite observations in the 1970s, the tip of the shelf had been disintegrating into icebergs in a series of what glaciologists call calving events. Conger was already reduced to a 50km-long and 20km-wide strip attached to Antarctica’s vast continental ice sheet at one end and the ice-covered Bowman Island at the other. Two calving events on March 5 and 7 reduced it further, detaching it from Bowman and precipitating its final collapse a week later. The world’s largest ice shelves fringe Antarctica, extending its ice sheet into the frigid Southern Ocean. Smaller ice shelves are found where continental ice meets the sea in Greenland, northern Canada and the Russian Arctic. By restraining how much the grounded ice flows upstream, they can control the loss of ice from the interior of the sheet into the ocean. When an ice shelf like Conger is lost, the grounded ice once kept behind the shelf may start to flow faster as the restraining force of the ice shelf is lost, resulting in more ice tumbling into the ocean. Ice shelves are sometimes referred to as the “safety band” of Antarctica because they buttress the upstream flow of ice from the bordering ice sheet. Little of the Antarctic ice sheet melts at its surface, where snow piles up. Instead, most of the continent loses ice through calving and melting along the underside of the floating ice shelves. The breaking and detachment of parts of ice shelves is a natural process: ice shelves generally go through cycles of slow growth punctuated by isolated calving events. But in recent decades, scientists have seen several large ice shelves undergoing total disintegration. Along the Antarctic Peninsula, the whip-like land mass which extends from the West Antarctic mainland, these include Prince Gustav ice shelf (from 1989 to 1995), Larsen A ice shelf (1995), Larsen B (2002), and Wilkins ice shelf (2008 to 2009). In East Antarctica, where Conger once was, Cook ice Shelf was partially lost in the 1970s. Taken together, this series of collapses suggests that some underlying environmental conditions, such as ocean and atmosphere temperatures, are changing. It is too soon to say what triggered the collapse of the Conger ice shelf, but it appears unlikely to have been caused by melting at the surface—there are no indications of any ponds atop the ice shelf. The most recent sequence of events also preceded the record high air temperatures recorded in Antarctica on March 18. As glaciologists, we see the impact of global warming on Antarctica in increasing ice loss with time. And what happens in Antarctica does not stay in Antarctica. The consequences of the Conger ice shelf collapse are unlikely to be of global significance as the catchment area feeding ice into the former shelf is small. And due to its shape, the Conger ice shelf was most likely not a significant buttress to the flow of ice upstream. But global warming is making events like this more likely. And as more and more ice shelves around Antarctica collapse, ice loss will increase, and with it global sea levels. There is enough ice in the West Antarctic ice sheet to raise sea levels by several meters, and if East Antarctica starts losing significant amounts of ice, the impact on sea levels could be measured in tens of meters. Not everything that happens in nature is due to global warming alone. Antarctica loses mass through the discharge of icebergs and waxing and waning ice shelves as part of a natural cycle. But what we are seeing now, with the collapse of the Conger ice shelf and others, is the continuation of a worrying trend whereby Antarctic ice shelves undergo area-wide collapse one after another.

3/29/2022,"Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman discusses the AMC stock surge after the company's CEO suggested that more M&A deals are in the works. JULIE HYMAN: According to Reuters, who interviewed CEO Adam Aron, apparently Aron said he would like to think there will be more third party external M&A announcements going forward. He says where AMC can reach for the stars. He says transformational M&A is mandatory. Again, all of this according to Reuters. And this, of course, following AMC's buy of the mining company or investment in the mining company, Highcroft. Those shares, by the way, are surging today, in addition to those AMC shares surging. So I don't know what those transformational acquisitions are going to be, but-- BRIAN SOZZI: I don't think he knows, Julie, I don't think he knows. JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, maybe not. I have to say, I was telling you guys this morning, I went to my first movie in a theater since the pandemic. It happened to be an AMC theater. Man, he's got to work on the popcorn situation. To me, that is the number one transformational acquisition he has to make. It was the saltiest popcorn I have ever had, practically inedible. That, to me, has got to be job one. BRIAN SOZZI: Julie, you should just skip the popcorn, skip that popcorn. Just bring yourself some of that Beyond Meat new plant-based jerky, fill your pocketbook with that. JULIE HYMAN: I could have done that or I could have gone old school and just brought in my own popcorn, which is-- BRIAN SOZZI: No, you don't want to do that. You don't want to be that person, you don't want to be that person. JULIE HYMAN: I 100% want to be that person. BRIAN SOZZI: No! JULIE HYMAN: 1,000%. I'll bring my own, I don't care, I'll bring my own popcorn. All right, on that note.",Business/Yahoo Finance Video,AMC stock soars after CEO teases more meme-stock powered M&A deals,https://news.yahoo.com/amc-stock-soars-ceo-teases-151431058.html
