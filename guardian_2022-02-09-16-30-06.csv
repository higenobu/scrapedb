2/9/2022,"The Conservatives’ birthday gift to the BBC, which is 100 this year, turns out to be culture secretary Nadine Dorries’s promise to abolish the licence fee, the funding mechanism that has allowed it to flourish as an independent institution beloved, trusted and envied across the world. Reading David Hendy’s The BBC: A People’s History in light of this latest attack on the corporation is a sobering experience. The author himself clearly feels the clouds gathering, and at times cannot banish an elegiac tone from his prose. Hendy’s stated aim is a kind of history from below: a counterpoint to Asa Briggs’s magisterial five-volume account of British broadcasting history to 1974, which occasionally gave the impression that the story of radio and TV consisted largely in calm, besuited bigwigs gliding through boardrooms and Whitehall, setting policies and initiating parliamentary committees. Hendy, rather, wants to give a place to the people who actually did the work: what historian Raphael Samuel called “radio’s penny-a-liners, the freelance playwrights and scriptwriters, scraping a living in the republic of letters, the foreign correspondents, the old soaks at Bush House, gathered from the four corners of the world”.  At times, Hendy succeeds magnificently. The picture he draws of the BBC during the second world war, for example, is full of the atmospheres that make Penelope Fitzgerald’s Human Voices, her novel of the blitz-struck Broadcasting House, so compelling. He brings the reader an unforgettable vignette, for example, concerning one Mary Lewis of the “duplicating section” – an all-female department in charge of typing and Roneoing all manner of paperwork. As it happens, Lewis spent 38 years at the BBC, finishing up in a senior position as head of pay policy. Here she is, though, as a young woman, on fire-watching duty with her pals, passing the time by doing a bit of stapling. It’s about 10pm, but the phone rings. A senior colleague asks if anyone’s free to do some work. She tells him the department’s closed, but if he wants, she can probably oblige. Understanding that the job is confidential, she extracts herself with difficulty from her friends, and is handed a document to type and run off. It turns out to be “the actual instructions for D-Day”. The landings will take place the very next morning. She is rewarded for her work with two eggs. And there must be a BBC drama – in tone somewhere between Operation Mincemeat, The Hour and W1A – in the extraordinary story of the coded messages that were slipped into wartime foreign-language services. If some kind of communication had to be got through to occupied Poland, for example, an officer from the Polish army-in-exile would turn up at the BBC just before the news, using the name “Peter Peterkin” and brandishing a record to be played on that’s night bulletin. It was not an infallible system. Once, the producer simply forgot to play the record. On another occasion, a BBC worker unfamiliar with the importance of the system lectured the Polish officer on the frivolity of playing music when there was so much news to report. Sometimes, programme assistants would decide the track specified was too scratchy to be played, and choose another. Thus “the wrong bridge would get blown up in Poland”, as one BBC employee recalled. There are some sobering sections on the BBC’s early attempts to include Black and Asian perspectives, including the melancholy tale of the Black poet and literary publisher Una Marson, who became a BBC producer in the 1930s. She clearly withstood terrible racism. (“Quite frankly I wouldn’t let anybody speak to me in the way Una does, and certainly not a coloured woman,” one colleague complained.) Eventually, suffering from what were described as “delusions” of persecution, Marson was diagnosed with schizophrenia and the BBC paid for her passage back to Jamaica. Hendy does not hesitate to meditate, either, on what now seems like an unthinkably cloth-eared, not to say cruel, position on The Black and White Minstrel Show, which, with its blacked-up performers, ran for two decades until 1978 – a fact that seems incredible until one considers just how racist a country Britain was, and how counterintuitive it would have seemed to the BBC to cancel what was a hugely popular programme, despite the petition against it organised by the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination. “Coloured people”, wrote the director general’s chief assistant, should “for Heaven’s sake shut up”. He was replying to a 1967 letter from the BBC’s chief accountant Barrie Thorne, one of the very few internal voices who showed strong opposition to what he described as an “underlyingly offensive” show. Hendy’s bottom-up approach stutters slightly when he tackles the postwar era. It is as if the BBC becomes so big, so inchoate, and so various in its competing cultures and multifarious activities that he seems slightly to lose sight of Samuel’s “penny-a-liners”. The brief time we spend with foreign correspondent Allan Little in the first Iraq war, for example, or Bridget Kendall in Moscow in 1991, is tantalising rather than especially revealing. He is so eager to show us the depth of the opposition to the corporation under Margaret Thatcher, and to run us through the scandals that have beset the BBC in recent years, that the granular texture of the earlier part of the book is somewhat smoothed out. Nevertheless, these sections do much to demonstrate the strength of the forces ranged against the BBC – and to show what an incredibly fragile position this much loved, much criticised organisation occupies in Britain’s divided polity.

2/9/2022,"Grace Tame has said in a speech to the National Press Club that she received a “threatening” phone call from a senior member of a government-funded organisation warning her not to criticise the prime minister, Scott Morrison, on the eve of last month’s Australian of the Year awards because there was “an election coming soon”. Tame, who attracted criticism from some commentators for her negative body language during an Australia Day reception with Morrison at the Lodge in late January, declined on Wednesday to name the organisation or the person who allegedly made the call in August.  The 2021 Australian of the Year said the caller told her “you are an influential person” and that “[Morrison] will have a fear”. “And then it crystallised, a fear – a fear for himself and no one else,” Tame said in her press club speech on Wednesday. “A fear he might lose his position or, more to the point, his power.” She said the intimidatory behaviour felt familiar to her as a survivor of grooming by a pedophile teacher. “I remember standing in the shadow of a trusted authority figure, being threatened in just the same veiled way.” “I remember [her assailant] saying: ‘I will lose my job if anyone hears about that, and you wouldn’t want that, would you?’” The revelation came during a joint address to the press club by Tame and former Liberal party staffer Brittany Higgins. The social services minister, Anne Ruston, later told Sky News an investigation was under way into Tame’s claim. A spokesperson for the prime minister said the first time Morrison became aware of the claim was at the press club, and added: “The prime minister has not and would not authorise such actions, and at all times has sought to treat Ms Tame with dignity and respect.” The spokesperson said while Tame had declined to identify the person “the individual should apologise”. They characterised the intervention as “unacceptable”. Tame later said on Twitter: “Scott conducting an investigation into who made the phone call is THE VERY SAME embedded structural silencing culture that drove the call in the first place and misses the point entirely.” In her speech, Tame said her objectives as a public survivors’ advocate were clear. She said she wanted “an end to the darkness, an end to sexual violence” and “a better future for all of us” which would be driven by “unity and truth”. She said some members of the media sought to project conflict on to her advocacy, in the process ignoring a record of “frank, productive meetings with politicians on all sides at both the state and federal level”. Tame said she had entered the public arena “because I made a conscious decision to stand up to evil, and I have been calling-out injustice ever since”. “To retreat into silence now would be hypocritical.” She said she was prepared to put her reputation on the line, because “when we act with integrity, the tide rises with us”. “I would rather go down as a disappointment to an institution than sell out as a pandering political puppet to the corrupt forces that coercively control it,” Tame said. “If you don’t take a strong stance to condemn abuse, you enable it.” Wednesday’s press club event followed a statement of acknowledgment in the parliament on Tuesday. Morrison, along with other political leaders, apologised for the “terrible things” that happened in parliamentary workplaces and acknowledged a culture of bullying, abuse, harassment “and in some cases even violence” had built up over decades. The statement was the first recommendation of a landmark review by Australia’s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, into federal parliament’s culture. The review, which recommended a significant overhaul of regulations and practices, found one in three staffers interviewed had been sexually harassed. The Jenkins inquiry was established after Higgins alleged she was raped by a colleague after hours, in a ministerial office in March 2019. Higgins said on Wednesday she chose to speak out “because the alternative was to be part of the culture of silence inside Parliament House”. She said she wanted the next generation of staffers to work in a better place. Addressing some of the moments where Morrison faced significant criticism for his handling of the allegation, Higgins said she didn’t want the prime minister’s sympathy as a father. “I wanted him to use his power as prime minister.” Morrison did not attend Wednesday’s press club event. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, was in attendance. Later, in question time, Labor targeted the government over its response to Kate Jenkins’s Respect at Work report and its commitment to the national plan to end violence against women and children.Albanese called for Morrison to adopt “firm targets” in its plan to end family violence.In response, Morrison said that the government was committed to targets that were “set out collectively and agreed together” and pointed to $2bn in funding towards women’s safety committed since 2013.“So we will be working continually through that cooperative … multipartisan process, and supporting that national plan in a way that no previous government has,” Morrison said.“And we will continue those investments because they are getting those results.” Labor MP for the seat of Lilley, Anika Wells, asked Morrison why the government had not adopted a recommendation from the Jenkins Review for a positive duty on employers to prevent sexual harassment in the workplace.After Morrison said that the government had implemented 42 of the 55 recommendations made in the Jenkins review, Labor again challenged the government on its decision not to accept that key recommendation.The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, said that “no recommendations have been rejected” and work was under way on the recommendations that had not yet been implemented, including on the positive duty requirement.

2/9/2022,"After months of speculation, this week finally gave us some answers, the 2022 Oscar nominations revealing some surprises among the easy-to-predict pack. Jane Campion’s queer psychodrama The Power of the Dog was the big winner, with 12 nominations, a richly deserved haul for a film some wondered might be a little too alienating for the Academy.  But the unusual and unsettling film proved popular, along with Dune, Belfast and West Side Story, dominating categories that had little room for filler. In a competitive year, there was no room for these Oscarbait also-rans: Making two considerably scaled films during the pandemic that were also considerably rather good was an achievement Ridley Scott deserves some sort of honorary Oscar for – an achievement made all the more impressive given the overall shoddiness of so many Covid-era offerings. But while sleek melodrama House of Gucci might have been more commercially lucrative and more prominent during awards season (but not with the Academy, more on that later), it was his ambitious and knotty epic The Last Duel that deserved more recognition. A complex attempt to correct an egregious historical injustice, the film subverted the sexism that so often dominates films of that ilk and elicited A-game performances from Matt Damon, Adam Driver, Jodie Comer and Ben Affleck, who was criminally nominated for a Razzie for his role. The Academy sadly remained as uninterested as audiences. It was a worryingly rocky year for musicals at the box office, with In the Heights and West Side Story hitting a bum note with audiences although both were at least warmly received by critics, the latter going on to score eight Oscar nominations. Left out in the cold by all though, was poor Dear Evan Hansen, the Tony-winning play that became a Razzie-nominated movie, a spectacular fall from grace for a project once primed for big things. The writing was on the wall, and all over Twitter, ever since the first trailer dropped with twenty-something star Ben Platt’s unsettling high school get-up an object of mass ridicule and things only worsened on release when the film surrounding him was unveiled as similarly off-key. Netflix might have picked up multiple nominations for The Power of the Dog, The Lost Daughter and Don’t Look Up but there was, deservedly, no Academy love for its drab Sandra Bullock vehicle The Unforgivable, a misfiring remake of a British miniseries. The actor, a winner in 2010 and a nominee in 2014, went for the well-worn de-glamming route, playing a woman just out of prison after being convicted of murder, but like her last Netflix film Bird Box, she had to settle for stats over statuettes. It was a monster hit for the streamer (Bullock is now the only woman with two films in their all-time top 10 most watched) but critics and voters wisely turned their noses up. There were a number of audible gasps yesterday as the nominations were announced (No Negga! But Buckley! And Drive My Car!) but easily the biggest shock of the morning was the lack of Lady Gaga, a star who’d remained one of the major best actress frontrunners for the entirety of the season. Her performance in House of Gucci had been somewhat divisive (although not as much as co-star Jared Leto’s) as was the film itself and the Academy ultimately decided against it, bar a token nomination for makeup and hairstyling. Twitter raged but Gaga remained ever-professional, wishing all nominees the very best via Instagram. It was the second snub of the year for Ridley Scott but this one was at least moderately successful at the box office. It was a good year for Monsters and Men director Reinaldo Marcus Green. His Richard Williams drama King Richard maintained strong awards buzz from its Telluride premiere right up to the big announcement, scoring six nominations including one for best picture. But as one surfed the highs, his other 2021 film skirted the lows, another well-intentioned star-led biopic, this time about the devastating true story of Joe Bell, the father of a gay teen who killed himself. Premiering at the virtual Toronto film festival back in 2020, the film was met with lukewarm reviews and faded from there, a tiny release with little to no marketing attached earlier this year. Star Mark Wahlberg, who gives one of his best ever performances, was perhaps hoping for a redemption arc that never came. The pandemic hasn’t been kind to director Joe Wright, who last summer saw his starry thriller The Woman in the Window offloaded to Netflix, where it became a giddily mocked hate-watch, recently nominated for a number of Razzies. He also used the time to retell the much-told tale of Cyrano, ambitiously shooting a big and brash musical at the height of Covid’s second wave in Italy. Reviews were mostly positive, if a little muted, after its premiere at last year’s Telluride film festival and for a while, star Peter Dinklage’s name was part of the best actor conversation. But the film emerged with just one nod for costume design, despite superficially ticking a number of Oscar-friendly boxes, ending up as yet another movie musical performed to an empty theatre. It’s been a while since George Clooney has seen himself a part of the Oscar race, an absence that’s not been down to a lack of trying. While the two-time winner (as supporting actor for Syriana and producer for best picture winner Argo) has mostly retreated from acting, he’s made a concerted effort to cement his status as a film-maker instead. But his more recent work hasn’t made much of an impact from The Monuments Men to Suburbicon to The Midnight Sky and now The Tender Bar, a sentimental adaptation of Pulitzer-winner JR Moehringer’s memoir. Ben Affleck, starring as JR’s uncle and surrogate father, picked up a Golden Globe nod but the film was rejected entirely by Oscar voters and met with a shrug from critics. The music biopic, one of the most repetitive and genuinely exhausting genres in Hollywood, still continues to impress Academy voters bringing mostly undeserved awards attention to recent films like Bohemian Rhapsody, The United States vs Billie Holliday, Judy and Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. But this year, former best supporting actress winner Jennifer Hudson couldn’t jimmy her way up into the best actress category with her role-of-a-lifetime work as Aretha Franklin in Respect. The passion project, which Hudson was picked for by Franklin herself, was criticized as being a little too formulaic on release and voters decided to ignore the film entirely.",Arts/Film,And the winners aren’t: this year’s Oscarbait films the Academy shunned,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/08/and-the-winners-arent-this-years-oscarbait-films-the-academy-shunned
2/9/2022,"The Tasmanian government’s back-to-school Covid packs have been mocked after primary school children were sent comically large adult surgical masks. Parents have been assured smaller sizes will be available at primary schools upon request after many took to social media posting pictures of the over-sized masks covering the entire faces of young children.  “A perfect fit, protects the nose, mouth, eyes and probably the ears too,” one person commented on social media. “My granddaughter in grade five got adult masks too, and how long are five masks going to last?” another person posted. “It’s a joke really.” Amy Pennicott tried an adult face mask on her young child and said it was simply unfeasible for her to wear it in or outside of the classroom. “My daughter is 10, 11 in June, and it’s clearly way too big,” she said. “The adult masks definitely are not alright for children.” A spokesperson from the Department of Education confirmed one size of surgical masks -the adult size - was included in the student Covid care packs distributed to families ahead of their return to school. “However, where that size of mask does not fit the student at primary school, there is a supply of smaller masks available at schools to ensure they are accessible for all students who want to wear them given they are not mandatory,” the spokesperson said. “While mask wearing is not mandatory in primary schools, primary schools across Tasmania have received a supply of more than 600,000 junior surgical masks if a child chooses to wear one and does not have their own.” Visitors to schools are required to wear face masks at all times but masks are only mandatory indoors for students aged over 12 years. Shadow education minister Josh Willie said the government was “gaslighting” Tasmanian families by suggesting there were thousands of junior surgical masks available while only distributing adult ones. “It’s like something out of ‘Yes Minister’,” he said. “The idea that they’re the best because they cover the whole face.” Willie acknowledged face masks were optional for children under 12 in Tasmania but said it remained a “perplexing and terrible look”. “My son is in the public system, he received an adult mask in his pack and I’ve been contacted by a lot of parents in the same situation,” he said. “I’ve been informed schools have junior surgical masks that just haven’t been provided.” A survey conducted by the Australian Education Union (AEU) found of its members, just one in five teachers felt safe to return to school in Tasmania and 20% were satisfied with the Tasmanian government’s Covid plan. AEU Tasmania president David Genford said the state government had failed to address safety measures ahead of schools returning this year. “The reality is, not enough has been done in our schools to protect students and teachers against the threat of Covid-19,” he said. “The government has had weeks to improve its Covid Return to School plan, but instead we’ll see students return to classes … with unacceptable, bare-minimum safety measures in place.” Minister for education Sarah Courtney has been overseas on leave. She contracted Covid while in France last week and is expected to return to work from Thursday, 10 February.",News/Australia news,"‘Protects the nose, mouth, eyes’: Tasmanian government sends large adult masks to children",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/09/protects-the-nose-mouth-eyes-tasmanian-government-sends-large-adult-masks-to-children
2/9/2022,"On day two of a protest against New Zealand’s Covid-19 policies on Parliament’s grounds in Wellington, the stamina and consensus of the crowd was fraying. On Tuesday, thousands arrived in convoys from across the country, but by Wednesday just a few hundred were left, despite pleas from protesters on social media for the crowd to “hold the line”. Perhaps it is because the list of complaints is extensive – there are signs about the vaccine mandates and restrictions for the unvaccinated, signs blaring vaccine disinformation, conspiracies that Covid-19 is a “plandemic”, worries about gene therapy manipulation of children, accusations of media corruption, claims of iwi (tribal) groups selling out, and requests to save a Northland oil refinery from closure.Cars are scrawled with imported causes and slogans: “We stand with Ottowa”, referring to the Canadian protests against vaccine mandates and “drain the swamp”, a catch-cry of Donald Trump’s presidency.  A protester stands on Parliament’s steps with a wall of masked police officers behind her and urges unity through a microphone. “Let’s remember why we are all here,” her voice echoes across the crowd, “the mandate”. Her own crowd boos and heckles her. “Don’t yell at me,” she pleads, before getting off. In front of the woman, the grounds look like a small music festival. Roughly 50 tents are erected – people are picnicking, others are hula-hooping, children are playing. A convoy of Winnebagos, caravans and cars clog the streets around Parliament’s grounds. A singer dedicates a song to spirits and faeries, another raps about New Zealand being an apartheid state. A group of children perched on a fence yell: “Got a vaccine pass? shove it up your ass!”. As some speakers preach for peaceful, respectful protest, three others attempt to break through the police barricade and are arrested – just hours after Parliament’s Speaker of the House, Trevor Mallard, issued the crowd with a trespass notice.Others, wielding signs of love and unity, tell journalists they should be executed. A message scrawled in chalk on Parliament’s forecourt reads “Hang ’em high”, next to a smiley face. “Remove your mask,” a man demands, as I walk through the crowd. When I say I would like to keep it on, he immediately asks if I’m from mainstream media. I reply that I am and he says “don’t twist the truth just because you’re on the government dollars”. He is not the only one demanding I remove the mask. Across the road, at the Backbenchers pub, the staff are on high-alert. On Tuesday, they were forced to shut just 15 minutes after opening for the day, after protesters started hurling abuse. “This is the most significant and volatile protest in 30 years,” its general manager and chef, Alistair Boyce, says. “There’s an inherent anger and feeling of injustice and overt intimidation that I’ve never witnessed before.” Usually protesters vent their anger at government, Boyce says, but this time it was turned against the restaurant, which is abiding by mandates and guidelines, including mask-use, vaccine passport scanning and limited gathering sizes. “We’re trying to operate the mandate as the government has required, so we were threatened and victimised.” Staff were told they were Nazis and violating human rights. Boyce is sympathetic to the protesters’ concerns about the mandates, and would also like to see them removed, but adds he cannot support “the anarchy and the mob rule” of the crowd. “We’re a divided country turning on itself.”Late on Wednesday afternoon, the crowd is slowly thinning and the mood is more subdued – less anarchist uprising; more picnic in the park. And while consensus among the protest group is looking shaky, there was unusual consensus from the other side of the barricade: Parliament. Not a single politician met the protesters. The prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, said on Wednesday that New Zealanders had a right to protest. “But New Zealanders also have the right to be vaccinated and the right to be kept as safe as possible in a pandemic and that’s exactly what we’re focused on – and that’s what the vast majority of New Zealanders are doing.” National party leader Christopher Luxon strained to pinpoint exactly what the protest was about. “I think there’s a range of protests out there, it’s very confusing to work out what it is. Essentially I think it’s not fair … when you’re impinging on others’ freedoms as they are, by blocking roads and making it difficult to get to and fro from work – that’s not what it’s about. “I appreciate that there’s a range of views, but bottom line what we’re seeing there is pretty antisocial and pretty abusive.”",News/World news,‘Let’s remember why we are here’: New Zealand anti-vax protest splinters into jibes and jabs,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/09/lets-remember-why-we-are-here-new-zealand-anti-vax-protest-splinters-into-jibes-and-jabs
2/9/2022,"“Idon’t have any dreams for the future because every dream depends on money,” says Resham, a 45-year-old from Banke, a district in Nepal bordering the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. “Time is passing and I’m getting older. Whatever comes my way, I will face it and go ahead with life.” Last year, Resham returned to Nepal after spending 10 years working at Supermax, a company producing medical gloves in Malaysia. In October, the US banned imports from Supermax based on evidence “that indicates the use of forced labour”, and the month after, Canada terminated its contracts. The UK, meanwhile, has named the British subsidiary of Supermax as an approved supplier in a new £6bn contract for gloves for NHS workers.  Like hundreds of thousands of Nepali workers, Resham travelled to Malaysia in search of a decent salary to send home. But after a decade, he returned with nothing. “It’s nice to be back with my family, but I worry about how to face my responsibilities,” says Resham, who needs to pay for his two teenage sons to finish their secondary education. A judicial review of the UK government’s contract award has been filed by Wilson Solicitors, the firm representing a group of workers, and co-claimants the Citizens, a media nonprofit that has investigated UK government contracts awarded through the pandemic. Nusrat Uddin, a partner at Wilson Solicitors, says: “This case is believed to be the first of its kind in the sense that it’s challenging the UK government’s own due diligence in relation to the products they are procuring, and how the processes they have in place adhere to legislation they have enacted themselves.”In 2015, Supermax was awarded part of a £320m to £375m contract to supply gloves to the NHS. In April 2020, the company then won an individual contract for £311m, awarded without tender due to emergency pandemic regulations. Criticisms of the company’s labour standards were well known when, in December 2021, they won a share of the £6bn NHS Supply Chain framework agreement. “It’s not fair,” says Saroj*, 27. “Instead of supporting these Malaysian companies, the UK should support workers who say they have been abused in the past and are being abused currently.” Resham and Saroj are among six former Supermax workers from Nepal interviewed about their time working in Malaysia. The men are mainly from rural areas and grew up in farming communities. Most did not finish or attend school due to their families’ financial situations. They travelled to Malaysia to provide for parents, siblings, spouses and children. But the repatriated workers allege they experienced poor working and living conditions at Supermax, including abuse, detention and salary deductions. Without access to their passports, and on reduced salaries, with debts to recruitment companies, most had no choice but to stay. When he was younger, Resham worked as a police officer in his village, but resigned after his family was violently targeted due to his position during the Maoist insurgency in Nepal. This led him to seek work abroad, eventually choosing Malaysia after a recruitment company told him that the “pay, weather, culture and working environment is good”. According to a 2017 report by Amnesty International, many Nepali migrant workers become “trapped in a vicious cycle of debt and exploitation”, with two-thirds of those surveyed paying excessive or illegal recruitment fees. Dil, a 32-year-old former worker from Nepal’s hilly Dhankuta district, describes how he felt Supermax was a difficult place “to talk with anyone or form friendships”. He says workers at the firm were “fired and abused” for raising concerns or making small mistakes, such as going to the toilet without a pass. Dil was fined four times for “not having a proper haircut”. According to Resham, after “official deductions” for food, accommodation and bills, as well as “unofficial deductions”, such as the haircut fine, he would be left with about £130 each month – well under half of his salary. As well as salary cuts, Resham claims he experienced detention and physical assault for speaking out about conditions, such as the low-quality food, the cost of which was deducted from their salaries. “As I’m speaking right now, it feels like I’m talking about a bad dream,” says Saroj, who tried to get sent home from Supermax by staying at his hostel rather than going to work. “I thought it was better to go back to Nepal instead of working at a company that was abusive and gave a very small income,” he claimed. Saroj says that as he was not working, he wasn’t allowed meals supplied by the factory. At the time, factory meals were automatically deducted from workers’ salaries, limiting their access to food. His friends snuck him some food, but his plan of being sent home failed. He says the company “said I would only be allowed food if I start working again. So I finally decided to rejoin the job”. Due to the pandemic and rising demand for gloves, working days at Supermax increased from 12 to 14–15 hours and workers were not allowed to travel home easily, Sitaram, 36, told the Citizens. “They held our passports forever … I definitely consider their behaviour to be forced labour,” claimed Sitaram, who was unable to go home when his father died last year. “After I requested for urgent repatriation, they suspended me and kept me at the hostel for one month without any salary,” he claims, adding that as part of Hindu culture he needed to be at the funeral as his father’s only son. “The company always used the pandemic as an excuse to hold us, I think, because if we went back, their workforce would be reduced and they wouldn’t be able to produce the gloves,” alleges Resham. “We completely appreciate that there is a global pandemic and there is an increased demand for PPE gloves,” says Uddin. “However, this government has championed itself as being world-leading in the fight against modern slavery, so that same government should surely be ensuring that the products that they are buying to protect their own citizens and medical staff are not being made by putting those across the other side of the globe in dire conditions.” After bans by the US and Canada, independent audits by those countries are being carried out at the Malaysian facilities. Earlier this month, Supermax announced that it was reimbursing recruitment fees to former workers, improving conditions and raising its minimum wage. Wilson Solicitors’ judicial review application states that in September 2021, “NHS Supply Chain received a detailed summary of evidence underpinning growing concerns about Supermax.” After the US decision to ban imports from Supermax, the company gave assurances to the UK that “three audits of its factories were under way and that the results could be provided”. Yet “inexplicably” the UK did not wait for the audits’ findings, finalising its assessment and awarding Supermax the contract. Supermax was approached for comment on this article on 1 February but did not respond. Two days later, the repatriated workers interviewed for this article were contacted by an affiliate of Supermax with an offer of compensation. In a statement on 8 February confirming that compensation would be paid, Supermax said it was setting up “a sinking fund to ensure that it remediates these former workers and all other eligible workers according to the revised eligibility criteria for remediation”. The statement said the company had “implemented a one-off RM5,000 [Malaysian ringgit] ex gratia payment to all its workers and shall add a further element of interest on the amount of past recruitment-related fees and costs paid by workers”. Reports from workers on the current conditions at the factory are mixed. Some claim that those who complained about conditions during an audit three months ago have received death threats from a Supermax supervisor. But one former worker, Jugal, 30, says that friends who remain at the factories are “happy because so many things have improved”, such as workers being allowed to bring their phones into the factories and eat their own food, as well as not having their salaries deducted. A spokesperson for NHS Supply Chain told the Guardian: “We take any allegations of this nature very seriously and do not hesitate to investigate claims made against manufacturers.

2/9/2022,"Amazon has struck a record-breaking deal to lease space at Shepperton Studios in the company’s first long-term commitment to making TV programmes and films in the UK. The company’s multimillion-pound deal with Shepperton, home to productions ranging from Alien to Mary Poppins Returns, will see it join its rival Netflix in having an exclusive contract at the Surrey studio as the streaming wars continue to fuel a race for space to ensure that productions can be filmed without delays.  While details of the deal have not been disclosed, it is understood that Amazon’s lease is for well over 10 years – longer than similar deals struck by Netflix and Disney, which has secured space at Pinewood Studios, the parent of Shepperton – which makes it the biggest vote of confidence to date in the UK’s booming £6bn TV and film production industry. “Shepperton has long been synonymous with top-tier television and movies and we’re proud that it will be home to many [Amazon] Prime Video productions in the years to come,” said Jennifer Salke, the head of Amazon Studios, which started filming productions in the UK in 2016 with The Grand Tour, from the ex-Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond. Amazon said that the next two years were expected be its busiest yet for UK-made productions, with Shepperton due to come online in 2023 when an expansion of the site is complete. The company would not say whether Shepperton would play a major role in the shooting of the eagerly anticipated Lord of the Rings adaptation, after the surprise decision to shift filming of the second series from New Zealand to the UK. While Bray Film Studios and Bovingdon Airfield have been chosen as initial production facilities when filming begins this spring – between them, the locations have been used by productions including Fast & Furious 6, Justice League, Rocketman and Mamma Mia! – regions of the UK including Scotland are hoping to benefit from the big-budget series seeking to ape the New Zealand settings of the Peter Jackson trilogy. For Pinewood, which has spent more than £1bn expanding its studio capacity since 2014, its bet on the streaming-fuelled demand for shooting facilities is paying off. “It is superb for us,” said Paul Golding, chairman of Pinewood Group. “There are essentially five studios out there today with the guarantee, clear visibility and capacity of their production slate to enter into long-term contracts, and we now have deals with three of them.” The other two – the Batman-maker Warner Bros and Universal, home to the Fast & Furious franchise – have their own facilities at Leavesden near Watford and the soon-to-open Sky Studios Elstree in north London. Pinewood and Shepperton will have grown from 29 sound stages across 100 hectares (250 acres) to 63 across 202 hectares (500 acres) when the latest investment programme is complete. “That is not the end of it,” said Golding, who said Pinewood had consent for a further 65 hectares (160 acres) to be developed. “It is a ringing endorsement of not just Pinewood, but also the UK film and TV industry.”",News/Media,Amazon signs record deal to film in Surrey studios for next decade,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/feb/09/amazon-signs-record-deal-to-film-in-surrey-studios-for-next-decade
2/9/2022,"Ihave been on a lot of miserable flights in my lifetime but one of my worst plane experiences is the Screechy Recorder Incident of 2012. It was exactly what it sounds like: a small child seated in my general vicinity played the recorder very loudly for what felt like several hours. Even with headphones on I could feel the screech-screech-SCREEEECH penetrate my skull. The recorder is an instrument of torture, simple as that. Even the most talented musician cannot make it sound pleasant. And, reader, this child was not a talented musician. Looking back at that flight I am amazed the kid stepped off that plane unscathed. Nobody got up and ripped the recorder from her hands (although, I’m not going to lie, I certainly thought about it). Nobody got into a violent altercation with her parents. Nobody had a meltdown. Everyone just gritted their teeth and ignored what was happening.  I have a feeling that things might have unfolded rather differently if the recorder incident had taken place more recently: thanks to the pandemic, a lot of people seem to have forgotten how to control themselves when stuck in a small space with strangers. Last year was a record year for air rage: there are normally around 100-150 reports of air rage on US airlines each year but in 2021 there were more than 5,700. And 2022 is off to a pretty belligerent start: at least two flights in January had to turn around because of unruly passenger behaviour. What do we do about all these angry passengers? Well, Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, wants to put them on a nationwide no-fly list. While airlines already have lists of passengers who are banned from flying with them, Bastian wants to go further and merge these lists so that passengers banned from one carrier will not be allowed on board any US commercial air carrier. On Monday, the US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg expressed support for this proposal: “I think we need to take a look at it,” Buttigieg told CNN. I have a lot of sympathy for beleaguered plane crew. But a federal no-fly list for unruly passengers is a civil liberties nightmare. The fact that Buttigieg is even vaguely entertaining such a terrible idea is alarming. Just look what has happened with the US’s no-fly list for suspected terrorists: the American Civil Liberties Union has gone to court against the government several times because innocent people have been placed on that list with zero information as to what got them on it, or how to get off it. Call me a bleeding heart liberal but I tend to think that putting people on opaque lists that curtail their freedom with no due process is generally a bad thing. If you want to punish unruly flyers, just stick them in cattle class on an overnight flight with a kid playing the recorder. Believe me, that is punishment enough.

2/9/2022,"The government’s withdrawal of the Domestic Renewable Heat Incentive (DRHI) at the end of March is going to penalise people like me whose projects have been delayed by Covid and supply chain shortages. In 2020, work was due to start on energy-saving renovations to our house, including a £22,000 water-source heat pump. We’d budgeted around the estimated £4,400 a year for seven years from the DHRI. The pandemic pushed back the start date to January last year. Supply chain issues and Covid caused further delays, and it’s unlikely the system will be certified by 31 March.IA, Bath, Somerset The DRHI gives householders quarterly payments, over seven years, for every kilowatt hour of renewable energy produced. The deadline for applications was originally March 2021. In March 2020, at the start of the pandemic, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) announced it would extend it by a year, but it could not, then, have predicted the full impact of Covid, coupled with the fallout from Brexit, on supply chains. There must be many others, like you, who began installations in good time to qualify, but who have been caught out by the turmoil. Householders whose installations do squeak through in time may still not be eligible because of the certification process.  BEIS says that the year-long extension was to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. “The scheme will be succeeded by the boiler upgrade scheme (BUS), to provide grants of up to £6,000 for the installation of clean-heat technologies. If consumers are unable to apply to the DRHI before its closure, they may be eligible for BUS grants.” This is good news for those who can’t afford to replace their boilers, because it provides up-front funding, although the £450m pot will only cover 90,000 homes. However, it’s small comfort to those who have nearly completed an installation in the expectation of far bigger subsidies. Environmental campaigners have criticised the government for short-changing households doing their bit to cut carbon emissions. “The government is sending all the wrong signals,” says Doug Parr, Greenpeace UK’s policy director. “While end dates for government-backed schemes do need to be set, arbitrary deadlines, during a post-Brexit pandemic, are unhelpful. “New schemes offering the same level of funding to DRHI applicants should be available, and homeowners who missed out on the DRHI, through no fault of their own, should be top of the list for BUS grants.”Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

2/9/2022,"Hello and welcome again to the Guardian morning briefing with me, Warren Murray.  Boris Johnson is being criticised for giving a plum appointment to arch-loyalist Mark Spencer despite claims, which he denies, that he told the former minister Nusrat Ghani her “Muslimness” had contributed to her sacking. Spencer has been moved aside as chief whip in Johnson’s mini-reshuffle but as compensation receives the prestigious role of leader of the House of Commons. He is replaced as chief whip by Chris Heaton-Harris, part of a team of Johnson loyalists who have operated a “shadow whipping” operation to prevent 54 Tory no-confidence letters being submitted against the prime minister. Heather Stewart and Peter Walker write this morning that the mini-reshuffle, promoting ultra-loyalists who have battled to save the PM’s skin, evidences little in the way of Johnson “fixing it” as he promised to do about dysfunction in Downing Street. “Taken together with allegations about the lobbying efforts of his new director of communications, Guto Harri,” our political team write, “the shake-up has perpetuated the sense that Johnson values loyalty above all else – and takes at best a relaxed approach to propriety and ‘chumocracy’ in government.” Jacob Rees-Mogg, the former Commons leader, has been made minister for Brexit opportunities. On that topic, the public accounts committee says in a timely report that Brexit red tape has damaged Britain’s trade with the EU. It calls on the government to work with Brussels to reduce hold-ups at UK ports. Tory grouping ‘fights net-zero plans’ – A group of Conservative politicians and their allies are attempting to derail the government’s green agenda, leading climate scientists claim. The Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) has gained widespread media coverage in the past month, attempting to link the government’s net zero agenda to the cost-of-living crisis and calling for cuts to green taxes and an increase of fossil fuel production. Michael Mann, one of the world’s leading authorities on the climate and author of The New Climate War, said the group appeared to be attempting to drag climate policies into a culture war, which he described as a “dangerous new tactic being used by those opposed to addressing the ecological emergency”. The 19 Conservatives confirmed to be in the group say they do not dispute climate science or the need to decarbonise.

Europeans ready to oppose Russia – Majorities across Europe think Russia will invade Ukraine in 2022 and believe both Nato and the EU should stand by Kyiv, according to polling for the European Council on Foreign Relations. Its director, Mark Leonard, said the data suggested a “geopolitical awakening” among EU citizens themselves at a time when EU states were being portrayed as “divided, weak and absent on Ukraine”. There was high trust in the EU and Nato to protect Europe from the Kremlin’s aggression, but less trust in the US, while few saw a role for the UK despite London’s “much-publicised show of solidarity with Kyiv”. Warning over bus route cuts – Almost a third of bus services in England could be axed within weeks if the government does not extend emergency funding, operators have warned. Pandemic support for bus routes is due to expire on 5 April, with passenger numbers still only about 70% of pre-pandemic levels. Operators normally have to give a minimum six weeks’ notice of route closures, meaning that many are already having to decide which will not be viable in the spring. A DfT spokesperson said: “We’re working closely with the sector to understand the potential challenges and possible mitigations once it ends in April.” Brit awards – Adele was the runaway winner at this year’s female-dominated Brits, taking home the prizes for artist of the year, album of the year for her fourth record, 30, and British song of the year for its lead single, Easy on Me. Dua Lipa won the fan-voted prize for best pop/R&B act, Lipa’s fifth Brit. Ed Sheeran won none of his four categories but was given the new songwriter of the year prize. In the ceremony’s first year without gendered categories, women and female-fronted acts dominated proceedings, winning 10 out of 15 prizes. The British categories were completed by two first-time winners. Wolf Alice took best group, and independent London rapper Little Simz, AKA Simbiatu Ajikawo, was named best new artist. British singer Becky Hill won best dance act, and best hip-hop/grime/rap act went to Dave. Leading the international awards, Billie Eilish took home best artist.

After the Taliban recaptured Kabul, there was a ceasefire with an initially receptive Pakistani government. But it collapsed within weeks, and on Sunday five Pakistani soldiers were killed in an attack claimed by the Pakistani Taliban, known as TTP. Pakistan has put fences on the porous border and wants the Taliban to crack down on TTP bases inside Afghanistan. The Taliban refuse to recognise a fenced border that both divides ethnic Pashtuns and hampers the militant group’s lucrative and illegal cross-border activities. In one widely shared video a Talib commander is heard saying to Pakistani soldiers: “If you come a step further, I will fight you here. We are happy to fight you.” At the Winter Olympics, favoured Mikaela Shiffrin of the US team has made a shock exit from the women’s slalom.

Jarrod Bowen of last season might not still have been on the pitch. It is not that his 68th-minute strike – the difference between West Ham and Watford on an otherwise nondescript night – was particularly late. But if there was a criticism that could be levelled at the forward it was his lack of endurance; Bowen completed 90 minutes eight times in 2020-21.

2/9/2022,"The European Union has announced a €43bn ($48bn) plan to overcome its dependency on Asian computer chip makers as governments and businesses around the world battle with a global supply chain crisis that experts believe could persist for much of the year. With consumers having to wait months for cars, dishwashers and other durables thanks to chip shortages, the bloc’s plan marks one of the most significant developments yet seen as a result of the tectonic shifts in the global economy set off by the coronavirus pandemic.  European commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday: “Chips are at the centre of the global technological race. They are, of course, also the bedrock of our modern economies. “The pandemic has also painfully exposed the vulnerability of its supply chains,” von der Leyen said. “We have seen that whole production lines came to a standstill. While the demand was increasing, we could not deliver as needed because of the lack of chips.” Von der Leyen said a “chips act” would link research, design and testing and coordinate EU and national investment. The plan pools public and private funds and allows for state aid to get the massive investments off the ground. The plan still needs the backing of the EU parliament and the member states. The EU move mirrors Joe Biden’s $52bn push to invest in a national chip-producing sector to make sure more production occurs in the United States, and one expert said it highlighted how the pandemic was reshaping the world economy. Per Hong, a partner and supply chain specialist with the US consultancy Kearney, said the disruptions could go on for months because the Omicron strain was still having a huge impact on all areas of the economy, especially in China. “We’re still in the early days of the disruption from Omicron running through every stage of the system, from suppliers to distribution to retail,” he said. “China is seeing its most serious surge of Covid cases since the original outbreak in Wuhan. The government is showing little sign of backing down from its zero-Covid approach so mass lockdowns, forced quarantines, and much stricter checks at ports to prevent cases from coming in are continuing.” The impact had been felt particularly in the manufacturing hub of Zhejiang, home to the world’s largest cargo port, Ningbo. Authorities had quarantined tens of thousands of residents and closed shipping terminals and suspended operations, forcing ships to reroute. In Xi’an, Samsung suspended operations at its semiconductor factory and staff were in full lockdown for three weeks in January, with disruptions extended by the week-long Lunar New Year holiday. Supply chain managers were adept at adjusting to unexpected natural disasters such as typhoons and fires, he said, but the consequences of the pandemic had been “far reaching” and went beyond contingencies. Shifts in geopolitics, the rise of nationalism and climate change were adding to the mix and were leading companies – as well as governments dealing with the computer chip crisis – to rethink how they do business. Hong said: “They are looking at shortened lead times, and moving production nearer consumption. But we are moving from just-in-time to just-in-case. There are a number of factors at play reshaping the economy, forcing companies to reassess what they’re doing.” Along with delays with key products and materials, businesses continue to be dogged by labour shortages thanks to ongoing surges of the virus and lockdowns, as well as by inflation not seen for decades. The recent round of company reporting in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific was punctuated by a litany of references to the problems managers are facing because of the supply chain issues. In the US, Harley Davidson said its customers would have to bear the brunt of component price rises, and Starbucks said it was raising its prices for the third time since October, while FedEx’s air cargo arm was booming as businesses sought a way around bottlenecks. In Europe, the UK’s biggest private employer, Tesco supermarket, said food inflation will hit 5% this spring on the back of tighter supply, the price of beer was rising due a “vicious cycle of costs”, and truck maker Iveco reported protracted supply chain issues on Tuesday. In Australia, analysts at Commonwealth bank this week said Covid-induced supply chain disruptions and labour shortages continued to drive a big lift in price pressures for businesses, weakening business confidence. On the upside, small-town butchers were thriving thanks to supply shortages leaving supermarket shelves bare.",News/Technology,EU hopes €43bn plan will fix chip shortages as supply chain crisis bites,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/09/eu-hopes-43bn-plan-will-fix-chip-shortages-as-supply-chain-crisis-bites
