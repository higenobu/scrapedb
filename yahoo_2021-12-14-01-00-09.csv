12/14/2021,"Source: Santiago Felipe / Getty School Principal Brandi Davis of LeBron James’ I Promise School has resigned following a startling accusation. An ongoing investigation was launched into Davis back in September after she was accused of slapping an 11-year-old student in the face for swearing. The mother of the victim released a statement to The Beacon Journal after the incident, claiming that her son “had a busted lip and was bleeding.” The student was reportedly wearing a mask over his face when the public school official struck him. According to the victim’s mother, Back in late September, she received a text message from Davis in the afternoon stating that she had slapped her son for using profanity after she approached him and a group of boys about a mess they left in the boy’s bathrooms. After the incident, the young student’s mother said she allegedly asked Davis why she would put her hands on her child, to which the former public school principal responded that she had “just reacted and slapped him.” RELATED CONTENT: Dana Delane-Williams Is The First Black Woman To Start A K-12 Virtual School Davis was an educator with the Akron Public School district for more than 20 years and was well respected throughout the community, which, the victim’s mother said, made the incident even more shocking. “We looked at you all as family,” she added, demanding for Davis to be held accountable. According to The New York Post, LeBron James’ I Promise School is currently in its fourth year of operation and was created to help “at-risk” students in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. The school released a statement following the incident detailing their commitment to the Akron education system and their “We Are Family” philosophy that strongly believes a student’s entire support system should be involved in the education process. “We are family, and that means we support every one of our I PROMISE educators, students, and family members through anything they may be going through,” the statement said. “In this and in every case, we will always do everything we can to make sure all are loved and supported during these times as we learn and grow as a family.” The investigation results are currently pending, but Davis could face more repercussions, The New York Post noted.

12/14/2021,"A Taiwanese minister displayed a map showing Taiwan and China in different colors at Biden's democracy summit. Several minutes later, when she spoke again, video feed of her presentation was cut. Sources told Reuters it was deliberate. The State Department said it was a technical error. A Taiwanese minister was cut from a video feed of President Joe Biden's democracy summit minutes after she presented a map showing her country as separate from China. The State Department blamed a technical error, though Reuters reported, citing sources, that it was deliberate. China insists that Taiwan is part of the country, whereas Taiwan, which has been self-governing for decades, is fiercely opposed to the idea. Speaking by video link as part of the Summit for Democracy on Friday, Taiwan's digital minister, Audrey Tang, presented a map showing countries ranked by civil rights as part of a ""digital authoritarianism"" discussion. The map, created by the CIVICUS nonprofit and which appeared on screen for about a minute, showed Taiwan marked in green, meaning it was ""open,"" whereas China was marked in red, meaning ""closed."" When the moderator returned to Tang about 20 minutes later, she was heard only on audio, with a visual placeholder reading ""Minister Audrey Tang, Taiwan."" Shortly after, a disclaimer appeared on the video feed, saying: ""Any opinions expressed by individuals on this panel are those of the individual, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the US government."" Watch her presentation of the map around the 4-hour, 24-minute mark, and the moment where only her audio appears around the 4-hour, 45-minute mark: Reuters reported, citing a source familiar with the matter, that US officials were spooked by the map and worried that it appeared to show US as separate from China. As a result, White House officials then told the summit's producers to make Tang's feed audio-only, Reuters reported. ""They choked,"" the source told Reuters, referring to the White House. ""It was clearly policy concerns,"" another source told Reuters. ""This was completely an internal overreaction."" However, US officials denied that the feed was cut deliberately. The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. The State Department told Reuters it was ""an honest mistake"" caused by ""confusion"" over screen-sharing. The White House National Security Council also told the outlet it was caused by confusion. However, according to Reuters, the NSC had sent multiple emails to the State Department over the issue and that the White House later complained to Taiwan. Taiwan responded by saying it was angered that Tang's video was cut, Reuters reported. But Tang told Reuters: ""No, I do not believe that this has anything to do with the ... map in my slides, or US allies in Asia for that matter."" In recent weeks, the Biden administration has tried to avoid committing to whether it supports the notion that Taiwan is independent of China, so as to not upset Beijing. China's aggressive posturing toward Taiwan, meanwhile, has increased in recent months. In October, Biden appeared to suggest that the US would defend Taiwan from an attack by China, prompting the White House to clarify hours later that the US policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" had not changed. And in November, Biden hinted, then appeared to retract, support for Taiwanese independence, prompting Chinese President Xi Jinping to tell Biden during their meeting that he was ""playing with fire."" Later that month, China told Biden that inviting Taiwan to his democracy summit was a ""mistake.""

12/14/2021,"By Nikolaj Skydsgaard COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Former Danish immigration minister Inger Stojberg, known for her hardline stance in that role, was handed a 60-day prison sentence on Monday by an impeachment court for having illegally ordered the separation of under-age couples seeking asylum. Stojberg was accused of knowingly breaking the law in 2016 by ordering the separation of all asylum-seeking refugee couples where at least one was under 18 years of age, a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. Under Danish and human rights law, couples must be assessed individually, implying that the minister's order to separate all underage couples was illegal. A total of 23 couples were separated. ""I'm very, very surprised. I think it is the Danish values ​​that have lost,"" Stojberg told reporters. ""I wished and still wish to protect these girls."" The right-wing politician, minister from 2015-19 for the Liberal Party, has repeatedly denied giving any illegal order, saying the aim was to stamp out child marriages and protect underage girls. Stojberg was considered one of the main architects behind Denmark's tough immigration policies, such as allowing authorities to confiscate asylum seekers' jewellery. ""I'm going to take my punishment with my head held high,"" she said. The case started when a Syrian couple complained to the country's ombudsman in 2016 after they were placed in separate asylum centres. A commission launched to investigate the case, also known as the ""child bride case"", concluded that the order was ""clearly illegal"". Twenty five of the 26 judges agreed to convict Stojberg in only the sixth impeachment court of its kind in the Nordic country in more than 170 years and first since 1995. ""We are satisfied with the verdict,"" prosecutors Jon Lauritzen and Anne Birgitte Gammeljord told reporters. ""It's a historic case."" The verdict is final and cannot be appealed.
