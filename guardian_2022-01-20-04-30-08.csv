1/20/2022,"The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, are to travel to Australia to try to cement security and trade ties in the aftermath of the Aukus deal involving the two countries and the US. The fact that two key cabinet figures are willing to leave the UK at a time of high domestic political tension with Boris Johnson’s future as prime minister in doubt and amid the threat of a Russian invasion in Ukraine shows the importance the Conservative government attaches to the relationship with Australia.  The UK has made a post-Brexit tilt to the Indo-Pacific central to its foreign and security policy, arguing the area represents one of high economic growth through this century. Britain, with its advocacy of free and open seas, has also like Australia shown itself willing to put itself at odds with China over issues such as Taiwan and human rights in the former British colony Hong Kong. In September the UK sprung a surprise by announcing that it was joining the US and Australia in a new security pact in which the central feature was an agreement that the US would share its technology on how to construct and operate nuclear powered submarines. The deal hatched in secrecy meant Scott Morrison’s Australian government cancelled its $90bn contract with the French to build more conventional submarines, prompting Paris to withdraw its ambassadors to Washington and Canberra for consultations, an unprecedented sign of acrimony between allies. France claimed it had been stabbed in the back by three of its closest allies. There were also claims that Australia, a non-nuclear state, was to have unique access to nuclear technology and secrets. There has been scepticism in some parts of the Australian political class whether the pact had enhanced Australian security since the new submarines might have a longer range and be less detectable, but would not be delivered until possibly a decade after the French submarines. But Aukus is intended to be more than an agreement about submarines and will cover the sharing of information in a number of technological areas, including artificial intelligence, underwater systems, and long-range-strike, cyber and quantum capabilities. The UK ministers are to meet their Australian counterparts, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, and defence minister, Peter Dutton. Truss said before the visit: “With malign forces threatening global peace and stability, it is vital that close allies like the UK and Australia show robust vigilance in defence of freedom and democracy. “The Aukus partnership between the UK, Australia and the United States is a clear demonstration of how we will defend our values, protect trade routes and increase stability across the Indo-Pacific.” Truss is also likely to agree to closer cooperation with Australia to boost opportunities for “honest and reliable” infrastructure investment for Indo-Pacific states, especially in the energy and technology sectors. She will discuss how best to strengthen global technology supply chains and tackle malign actors who disrupt cyberspace. “The UK and Australia share one of the oldest and strongest defence and security alliances,” Wallace said. “Operating and exercising side-by-side, we continue to work together to promote stability and tackle our shared threats with our like-minded ally head-on.”",News/World news,Senior UK ministers head to Australia to cement defence and trade ties,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/senior-uk-ministers-australia-defence-trade-ties-liz-truss-ben-wallace-aukus-pact-britain
1/20/2022,"Sajid Javid has set out plans to abolish virtually every existing Covid restriction over the coming weeks in England and “get life completely back to normal”, a course popular with Conservative MPs but which prompted warnings from NHS and public health groups. After Boris Johnson announced the end of all plan B rules, imposed to cope with the Omicron variant, by next week, the health secretary set out the government’s wider vision to go further, with rules on self-isolation expected to be replaced by voluntary guidance in March.  “I will come back in the spring and set out how we will live with Covid,” Javid told a No 10 press conference. “But the way we are going to do this is that we are going to have to find a way to remove almost all of these restrictions, and get life completely back to normal.” While Susan Hopkins, the chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency, told the press conference that any end to self-isolation would have to be based on evidence, Javid was notably bullish, saying he expected would be vaccination and testing would be the only measures to remain. “This plan has worked and the data shows that Omicron is in retreat,” he said. While warning of “bumps in the road”, perhaps including new variants, Javid said the UK “must learn to live with Covid in the same way we have to live with flu”. In a statement to the Commons earlier on Wednesday, Johnson announced that the cabinet had agreed an end to all plan B measures. Advice on working from home would change immediately, while compulsory mask-wearing on public transport and in shops and vaccine certificates would cease next week. To cheers from some on the Conservative benches, Johnson announced an immediate end to the need for pupils to wear masks at secondary schools. Responding for Labour, Keir Starmer said he would back the change as long as it was supported by evidence, saying Johnson must “reassure the public he is acting to protect their health, not just his job”. While Covid rates have fallen in recent days, confirmed daily UK cases remained above 108,000 on Wednesday, with nearly 19,000 Covid patients in hospital. Teaching unions expressed concern about the sudden change, warning that many headteachers in England were still seeing widespread disruption to education owing to Covid. Mary Bousted, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “While the trend amongst secondary aged children is down, it is however uncertain, due to the short time schools have been back since the Christmas holidays, that this trend will continue. Such uncertainty could lead to a pronounced risk of increased disruption with children and staff having to isolate.” Saffron Cordery, the deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, pointed to the high number of Covid-19 patients in hospital “at a time when the NHS is already at full stretch and contending with the toughest winter on record”, and some regions were still seeing increased infection numbers. Pat Cullen, the general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said ministers would “regret sending the wrong signal to the public for political expediency”. Unison, the UK’s largest health union, warned that ditching plan B “in one fell swoop” risked jeopardising progress made. Christina McAnea, the union’s general secretary, said: “Rather than allowing a free-for-all, ministers should be urging caution and encouraging continued mask-wearing on transport, in public places and in schools, where it can still make a real difference.” A director of public health in a city in the north of England said they were also concerned at the move. “This feels like more of a political decision than a decision based on the evidence and the science, and it could be quite London-centric,” they said. “We’re seeing a reduction in cases, but they’re still incredibly high. Taking out all these measures does feel risky. And if our focus is keeping kids in schools as much as possible, this may result in more disruption to education. I worry the decision has not been made for the right reasons.” The changes apply only to England.

1/20/2022,"A 14-year-old schoolboy from Darlington has become one of the youngest people in the UK to be convicted of terror charges. The boy, who cannot be named because of his age, appeared before Westminster magistrates court on Tuesday charged with possessing a terrorist publication.  He pleaded guilty to three offences contrary to section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000. He admitted possessing a record of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism. Police said the charges related to extreme rightwing terrorism. The boy was arrested in July last year, when he was 13, as part of a pre-planned, intelligence-led operation led by officers from Counter-terrorism North East. He will next appear for sentencing on 1 April. Before this case it is thought the youngest person convicted of a terror offence was a teenager from Blackburn jailed for inciting terrorism. The Blackburn boy, referred to as RXG, was jailed for life in October 2015 for convincing an Australian jihadist, Sevdet Besim, then 18, to plot an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day. A court heard that RXG, then 14, exchanged from his bedroom more than 3,000 encrypted messages with Besim, encouraging him to behead police officers guarding an Anzac Day event. Australian police foiled the plot. The court heard how RXG had been radicalised by online Islamic State propaganda. Last year the Parole Board ruled that RXG could be freed from prison under strict licence conditions. His identity will remain a secret for the rest of his life after a high court ruling in 2020.",News/UK news,14-year-old boy one of youngest in UK to be convicted of terror charges,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/19/14-year-old-boy-one-of-youngest-in-uk-to-be-convicted-of-terror-charges
1/20/2022,"MPs have voted to approve a one-day suspension for the Conservative MP Daniel Kawczynski after he “undermined” an apology he gave in the Commons for bullying staff. The standards watchdog found that the Shrewsbury MP had indicated in media interviews that he did not fully mean the gesture, and recommended his suspension should be limited to one day as Kawczynski had committed to undertaking further work on his behaviour.  Kawczynski initially apologised in the Commons in June last year after an investigation found he had ranted at one senior Commons official, called another a “snowflake” and “useless”, and denigrated a third staff member via WhatsApp. He told the Commons: “I have reflected on my behaviour, I accept it constituted bullying and as such was highly inexcusable.” In an interview with his local BBC radio station earlier that day he said the process was unfair and he had no choice but to apologise, prompting a fresh inquiry. In a personal statement in the Commons on Wednesday, Kawczynski said he acknowledged speaking to the media “undermined the sincerity” of his apology and said: “I am sorry that my conduct will have had a further harmful effect on the complainant and that it may have diminished public confidence in the process.” He added: “I accept that speaking out in the way I did to the media had a detrimental effect on the house’s conduct policy by undermining the integrity of the complaints process and I deeply regret my actions. I am committed to learn from the mistakes I have made and to work on my personal development, especially in my communication with others, in every interaction that I have. “I am conscious that my conduct may have merited suspension from the service of the house for a longer period.” The report by the House of Commons standards committee, published last week, found Kawczynski was “still struggling with a capacity for genuine empathy with others, and as a result still has a tendency, which he may not fully realise, to see himself rather than others as the ‘victim’”. The MP said he appreciated “the committee’s consideration of the difficulties that I was experiencing in my personal life of the time and the mental health issues”, having previously said he was in “an emotional and distressed state” on the day of the interview. “A profoundly emotional and devastating family trauma in 2019, coupled with a series of work-related problems, combined to affect my mental health in an unprecedented way,” he said in a statement after publication of the report, adding that he was receiving “abuse in the street” whenever he went out. “I wish to reiterate that nothing I have said about my own mental health struggle should detract in any way from my full acceptance of the committee’s decision.”",News/Politics,Commons backs suspension for MP who ‘undermined’ own apology for bullying,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/commons-backs-suspension-for-mp-who-undermined-own-apology-for-bullying
1/20/2022,"It was fun while it lasted. Unilever says it won’t bump up its £50bn offer for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer products division, so one has to assume that’s the end of the saga. GSK’s board, after all, can’t credibly have second thoughts about entering a negotiation: it had rejected £50bn as a “fundamental undervaluation”. Yet two big questions remain for Unilever’s board. First, why wasn’t the refusal to improve the offer made on Monday this week? On that day, remember, the chief executive, Alan Jope, emphasised exactly the same commitment to “strict financial discipline” but also declined to rule out a higher bid.  The natural explanation is that Unilever’s shareholders lobbied furiously to get the expedition called off. The share price fell 10% in two days, which was a clear sign of little confidence in the plan. At £50bn, investors might have been persuadable, but not at a higher price. In the circumstances, the board had little choice but to retreat. Even so, delivering a minor heart attack to the share price, however temporarily, is not a good look. The out-of-the-blue factor points to the second question: what’s plan B? There has to be one because Jope also said on Monday that there were alternative options to pursue the new goal of being bigger in healthcare. That could mean anything from taking aim at another mega-sized target, such as Johnson & Johnson’s consumer division or Reckitt, or a series of smaller deals. Either way, uncertainty hangs in the air. The shame is that the GSK business looked a good fit. And there’s nothing wrong with the ambition to expand in healthcare while slimming the food side. But after three days of excitement, Unilever has succeeded only in showing how difficult it could be to execute its change of direction. Jope has a trust-building challenge with shareholders. It’s not plain sailing over at GSK either. Hal Barron’s exit as chief scientific officer is a heavy loss in a critical year. Barron was the first major hire by Emma Walmsley after she became chief executive in 2017 and he arrived with a stellar reputation from the US, injecting credibility into Walmsley’s pitch that her top priority was to reinvigorate GSK’s pipeline of new drugs. Since true reinvigoration at a pharma company can take a decade, Barron’s four years in post don’t qualify as a full innings. That is especially so when “new GSK”, without its consumer division (now destined for demerger in the summer unless somebody other than Unilever wants to take a pop), will stand or fall by results from the labs. Barron is 60, so one can speculate that if he’s minded to do another big job, he thinks this is the moment. He’s off to be chief executive of Altos Labs, one of those San Francisco startups backed by billionaires, including Jeff Bezos, that will probably become enormous. It is targeting the hot scientific field of cell rejuvenation. One can also guess that Barron has sufficient zillions to go where his scientific interest takes him: his 16 years at the hugely successful US firm Genentech will have been rewarding. From GSK’s point of view, the best one can say is that Barron is staying until the end of July and will be a day-a-week nonexecutive director thereafter. It’s an unusual arrangement but probably pragmatic. Barron’s successor is an internal appointment, Tony Wood, 56, who has a low profile in the City but may be a name to watch. The last Brit in the same role at GSK was the pandemic TV star Sir Patrick Vallance, otherwise known as the government’s chief scientific adviser. Last year will not have felt like a bonus year for WH Smith’s shareholders. The retail group made a pretax loss of £116m, mostly for obvious Covid reasons. The share price, having been clobbered at the start of the pandemic, went roughly sideways. There was no dividend. WH Smith’s remuneration committee, on the other hand, preferred to emphasise the “outstanding, inspiring and resourceful leadership” of Carl Cowling, the chief executive, and Robert Moorhead, the chief financial officer. Cue bonuses, justified on the ground that EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) targets were hit. Seemingly sensing it might all look odd, the committee knocked 22% off the bonuses to recognise, in the cute phrasing, “the experience of shareholders and other stakeholders”. Well, yes, the experience of taxpayers is one of sending furlough payments to WH Smith staff only to see bonuses of £550,000 and £357,500 emerge for the bosses. Almost 46% of votes were cast against the pay report on Wednesday. It is hard to fathom what the other shareholders were thinking.",News/Business,Big questions for Unilever board after GSK pursuit ends,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/jan/19/big-questions-for-unilever-board-after-gsk-pursuit-ends
1/20/2022,"What a difference a day makes. On Tuesday Big Dog had been Hang Dog. Not remorseful exactly, as that would require a level of empathy and self-knowledge that is well beyond him. But certainly abject. Sorry for finding himself in such a mess, if not for causing it. Sorry that he had reached the end of the road. Come prime minister’s questions, the trademark defences were back in place. The desperation of a leader, already on borrowed time, who is having to beg for yet another last chance. It’s a sight with which countless betrayed wives and girlfriends are all too familiar. First there was the surefire tell that Boris Johnson is about to start lying: the smirk (though these days it’s rarer to find a time when he’s telling the truth).  Then there were the desperate and petulant displays of temper, masquerading as banter, from someone who hates to be challenged. A man who consistently mistakes arrogance for genuine self-worth. Finally, there was the contempt. Not just for opposition MPs but also for his own. Especially for his own. He has even less respect for those who buy his crap than those who call him out for the chancer he knows himself to be. Mostly, though, the contempt is for himself. Deep down, at a subconscious level, Boris knows better than anyone that he degrades both his position and the country. PMQs opened with Christian Wakeford, the former Conservative MP for Bury South, defecting to Labour by taking his seat behind Keir Starmer on the opposition benches. A few Tories jeered as the Labour leader welcomed Wakeford to the party, and Starmer ad libbed that the chief whip must have told them to bring their own boos. That stung. It was meant to be their man, their Big Dog, who told the best gags. Now they didn’t even have that. This was Starmer at his most relaxed. He wasn’t that bothered if Johnson went that day or in a week or month’s time. The exit was now priced in, so he would make the most of it and just have some fun with the prime minister along the way. He ran through Big Dog’s catalogue of excuses. First there had been no parties. Then he had been sickened and furious that others in Number 10 had had parties. Then he had been at some of the parties. Then he hadn’t realised the party he had been at had actually been a party. And in any case he had spent the 25 minutes at the party in a totally dissociated state, so he hadn’t noticed there were tables laden with food and booze and people getting pissed. Then when he had come to his senses and realised he was at a party, he had no idea such gatherings were illegal as no one had bothered to tell him what the rules were. Even though he had made them up and had spent an hour a day at press conferences telling the country what the rules were. The five stages of coming to grief. Big Dog tugged at the toddler haircut and waved a paw dismissively. It all made perfect sense, only the entire country was too stupid to see it. “You’ll just have to wait for the Sue Gray inquiry to report back,” he said. Though even if Gray doesn’t directly apportion blame, it’s hard to see how Johnson comes out of an inquiry with a shred of credibility. Just imagine. The best Gray could say about the prime minister was that he had either been in a fugue state or that he was incapable of distinguishing between a party and a work meeting. Starmer continued to expose the absurdities of Johnson’s lies and all Big Dog had to offer in return was more and more lies. He claimed the Tories had fixed the cost of living crisis when only that morning inflation had risen to 5.4%. He claimed to be proud of the work his staff at Number 10 had done while boasting about how many he was going to sack to save his skin. Keep it classy. He claimed it had been him alone who had made all the right calls on Covid when in the first year he had got most things wrong. He lied about the UK having the highest booster take-up in Europe. We don’t. The SNP’s Ian Blackford mentioned the record-breaking 175,000 who had died. Big Dog just sniggered, pulled faces and played with his watch. Still keeping it classy. There was a small band of Boris loyalists, but most Tories were as unimpressed with their leader as the opposition MPs. None who spoke showed any flicker of support, preferring to keep things neutral. Though not David Davis. He went nuclear. Enough was enough. Quoting both Oliver Cromwell to parliament and Leo Amery to Neville Chamberlain, he said to a hushed chamber: “You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go.” This wasn’t your average Tory malcontent. It was a respected old-timer, an arch Brexiter and longtime Johnson supporter who saw through Big Dog’s pantomime theatrics. Boris tried to shrug off the attack but was visibly shaken. He even said he had no idea where such a famous quotation came from. It makes you wonder if he actually wrote – let alone read – the passages in his book about Churchill that cover the early years of the war. Johnson the Great Pretender. Who can’t even cut it as a pound-shop Churchill. It was telling that after this, only a few Big Dog diehards bothered to stay for his statement declaring that Covid was as good as over. Boris ploughed on regardless. Even though 438 people had died the day before and the NHS was stretched to breaking point, Johnson was removing all remaining restrictions because that was popular with his party. Besides, if you’re incapable of sticking to the rules, you might as well get rid of them.",News/Politics,Big Dog’s contempt comes back to bite him | John Crace,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/big-dogs-contempt-comes-back-to-bite-him
1/20/2022,"Unilever has said it will not increase its offer for GlaxoSmithKline’s consumer healthcare division above £50bn after investors and analysts balked at the risk of it pulling off a large merger. Data shared by GSK suggested the “fundamental value” of the business was no higher than £50bn, Unilever said after the stock market closed on Wednesday.  Unilever, which owns brands ranging from Hellmann’s mayonnaise to Dove soap, made three offers to GSK, the last of which was worth £50bn in cash and Unilever shares. GSK is planning to list its consumer arm, which includes brands such as Aquafresh toothpaste and Panadol, by the summer. News of the bids was leaked at the weekend, forcing Unilever to clarify its strategy. In a hastily arranged announcement its chief executive, Alan Jope, said the company was planning to focus on fast-growing health, beauty and hygiene brands and sell slower-growing operations, with parts of its vast food portfolio a key candidate. However, investors did not appear to welcome Unilever’s ambition. Its share price dropped by almost 11% on Monday and Tuesday, before rallying by 4.5% on Wednesday. The credit rating agency Fitch on Tuesday said a debt-fuelled purchase of GSK consumer healthcare division could trigger a “multi-notch downgrade” of Unilever’s rating, which could make borrowing much more expensive and force some investors to dump the shares. Unilever has struggled under Jope’s leadership, and shares remain almost 30% below their 2019 record high. The market value has fallen by a fifth during the last 12 months even as the FTSE 100 has gained 13%. The company was criticised by Terry Smith, a prominent fund manager, for focusing on sustainability rather than the fundamentals of the business – although Jope argues that environmental, social and governance credentials will protect it financially in the long term. In its statement on Wednesday, Unilever said: “We note the recently shared financial assumptions from the current owners of GSK consumer healthcare and have determined that it does not change our view on fundamental value. Accordingly, we will not increase our offer above £50bn.” GSK said on the weekend that the £50bn bid “fundamentally undervalued” the business, suggesting a merger with Unilever would be unlikely. Unilever added that was “committed to maintaining strict financial discipline to ensure that acquisitions create value for our shareholders”, rather than chasing market share at the expense of profitability. Jope on Monday characterised the approach as “improving the quality of Unilever, not necessarily the size of Unilever.”",News/Business,Unilever will not increase £50bn offer for GSK consumer arm,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/unilever-will-not-increase-50bn-offer-for-gsk-consumer-arm
1/20/2022,"My aunt, Mona Warren, who has died aged 94, recently recalled how, when she was the only female solicitor in Cornwall during the early 1960s, those addressing Cornwall Law Society meetings would begin: “Gentlemen and Miss Warren”. After ill-health prevented her completing a chemistry degree at the University College of South West of England (now the University of Exeter) in the 40s, she learned shorthand working at the Methodist Missionary Society in London before becoming an articled clerk in St Buryan, Cornwall, where she lived, and subsequently a solicitor in Penzance.  Mona experienced severe epilepsy from young adulthood until late middle age. My parents had moved from Cornwall to Stevenage in 1957, and in 1973, when Mona was unable to live alone, she came to stay with us. Despite adversity, Mona was active in many fields, volunteering with the Citizens Advice Bureau (now Citizens Advice) and the Samaritans, and becoming a Labour councillor for Broadwater ward in Stevenage in 1989, and vice-chair of Hertfordshire county council in the 1990s. She was re-elected as councillor for Broadwater in 1993, retiring at the 1997 election. When I was a boy, Mona took me to a court hearing where she was the defence solicitor. Afterwards I asked her how she could defend people who were guilty. Her response stayed with me: “That is not for me to decide – their case should be heard.” Justice was core to Mona’s outlook – but social justice, not just narrow legalism. She gave witness to this in many ways: as a Methodist lay preacher in the 1960s, a national director of CND (1998-2000), and a member of the executive committee of the Christian Socialist Movement in the 1990s. Mona was born on the Isle of Man. Her parents, Lily (nee Radcliffe) and William Warren (known as Norman), were Methodist missionaries. They had to leave their home in China in 1927 when the country was experiencing increasing violence. My mother, Mary, remembered the journey, recounting how, with their mother pregnant with Mona, their father hired a sampan, declining a naval boat proposed by the British consul, fearing this would make things worse. An encounter with “bandits” at one point was resolved, although their luggage was lost. Perhaps learning of this episode contributed to Mona’s tremendous ability in advocacy and negotiation. Mona attended Trinity Hall in Southport, a boarding school for girls provided by the Methodist church in order to avoid any disruption to their education. In the 20s and 30s, Methodist ministers, such as my grandfather, were required to move frequently. After settling in Stevenage in the 70s, Mona remained there, living with a close friend, until moving back to Cornwall, to Saltash, where my parents were then living, in 2003. Mona is survived by her nephews, Rod and me, five great-nephews and two great-great nieces.",News/Law,Mona Warren obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/19/mona-warren-obituary
1/20/2022,"Boris Johnson’s habitual boosterism was back on display on Wednesday after a humiliating TV interview a day earlier raised questions about his state of mind. By scheduling a House of Commons statement on lifting Covid restrictions in England immediately after prime minister’s questions, Johnson’s team enabled him to return to comfortable territory, hailing the UK’s booster vaccine rollout and bashing Keir Starmer.  But the fact it was Sajid Javid, not Johnson, fronting the Downing Street press conference on Wednesday evening underlined the fact that the prime minister remains bruised and reluctant to face a string of journalists’ questions. Those who have worked closely with Johnson describe his changeable moods: a constant tug-of-war between bullishness and insecurity – and a tendency to be thrown off course by negative press coverage. His allies have been rallying round in recent days in an effort to instil some fight in him, something they see as critical to his political survival. “When he’s up he’s very up, and when he’s down it affects everything,” one MP said, adding that the party needed him to “recover his mood”. The MP cited Tuesday’s badly received interview as an example of how the prime minister performs when he is not feeling positive. In the extended grilling by the Sky News political editor, Beth Rigby, a hangdog Johnson repeatedly apologised but continued to defend himself, saying of the 20 May 2020 Downing Street drinks party that “nobody told me it was against the rules”. “I can’t believe we would have gone ahead with an event that people said was against the rules … nobody warned me it was against the rules, I am categorical about that – I would have remembered that,” he said in one rambling answer. The former cabinet minister David Davis cited that interview as he dramatically called on Johnson to resign in the Commons on Wednesday, saying: “I expect my leaders to shoulder the responsibility for the actions they take. Yesterday, he did the opposite of that.” After the awkward semi-contrition of the Sky interview, there had been questions about whether Johnson would even contest a vote of no confidence, triggered if 54 of his MPs send letters in to the 1922 Committee chair, Graham Brady. But asked if he would fight it, his press secretary said on Wednesday: “Yes he will.” She also robustly denied reports that the prime minister had been in tears in a meeting with MPs, insisting “it’s not true”. Johnson spent the afternoon meeting more Tory MPs and peers. “The broad focus of all these meetings will be on what we’ve delivered for the country so far since we were elected, from getting Brexit done to record investments in local transport and infrastructure to tackling this unprecedented pandemic,” his press secretary said. He was keen to show that he could still be the upbeat, charismatic campaigner who helped MPs win their seats, though current polling suggests he may be an electoral liability rather than an asset. With several cabinet ministers including Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss plotting leadership bids – though Truss is currently far from the action in Australia – Johnson appears to have retreated to a small circle of ultra-loyal friends. It is understood he has been seeing a lot of Conor Burns, a minister for Northern Ireland, ardent Thatcherite and very close confidant, who is supporting him through his political troubles. Even his closest allies acknowledge the mood could rapidly darken once again in the coming days as his MPs continue to gossip and plot – and Sue Gray completes her inquiry into the Downing Street parties that have pushed the prime minister into the biggest crisis of his premiership.",News/Politics,Bruised Boris Johnson comes out boosting after TV humiliation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/bruised-boris-johnson-comes-out-boosting-after-tv-humiliation
1/20/2022,"WH Smith has been hit by a massive shareholder rebellion, with more than half its investors failing to back payment of a £550,000 bonus to the retailer’s chief executive after it benefited from tens of millions of pounds in pandemic relief. In the group’s second bloody nose from investors in two years, just over 53% registered their dissent on the remuneration report including those voting against and those withholding their votes. Just over 45% of votes cast were against the retailer’s plans at the annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday.  WH Smith has been a big beneficiary of taxpayer funds via furlough support and business rates relief through the pandemic. The vote came after WH Smith said its chief executive, Carl Cowling, who has led the retailer since November 2019, was in line to receive a bonus of £550,000 on top of a salary of £550,000 for the year to September 2021, as well as benefits and pension payments worth £85,000, according to WH Smith’s latest remuneration report, a total of £1.18m. From April, Cowling’s pay will rise to £600,000 with the potential to earn an annual bonus of £960,000 on top. In January last year the FTSE 250 retailer delayed a £25,000 pay rise given to Cowling in July 2020 after investors expressed anger against the move. WH Smith took £40m in business rates relief and £11m in payments from furlough schemes in the UK and elsewhere in the year to September 2021 according to its annual report. That was on top of £20m in business rates relief in 2020. The company said that it thought Cowling deserved the pay rise, which was delayed until September last year, amid concerns over the top-up when workers had been furloughed and the value of its shares had fallen. A spokesperson for the company, which has long been known for chunky executive payouts including handing former boss Kate Swann £9m after her final year, said there were no plans to alter its pay award for Cowling. “Despite being among the businesses hardest hit by the pandemic, WH Smith has emerged in a strong position and anticipates a return to profit in 2022,” it said. “This is as a result of the hard work of all our people, led by our executive directors. “The remuneration arrangements published in our annual report and accounts are consistent with the remuneration policy which over 98% of shareholders supported in 2019 and come alongside the award of bonuses to approximately 1,750 colleagues across our stores and head office to recognise their exceptional efforts through the pandemic.”",News/Business,WH Smith hit by shareholder rebellion over bonus,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/19/wh-smith-hit-by-shareholder-rebellion-over-bonus
1/20/2022,"Emma Raducanu has cited her reaction to recent adversity as essential in helping her remain on the right track and to arrive at the Australian Open in an optimal frame of mind. Last week in Sydney, Raducanu opened her season with a brutal 6-0, 6-1 loss to Elena Rybakina in less than an hour, a defeat that came at a time when she was still recovering her fitness levels after contracting Covid in December. Minutes after leaving the court, Raducanu returned to practice and she was in a positive frame of mind as she spoke afterwards.  “I didn’t waste any time at all,” she said. “I was constructive and straight back on the practice court working, which was pretty unusual to go out there straight after a loss like that. So I was feeling good, and that’s definitely a moment where I was like, ‘OK, you know where you’re at, let’s just keep working and see what happens next week.’” On Tuesday, Raducanu defeated Sloane Stephens 6-0, 2-6, 6-1 to reach the second round of the Australian Open on her senior debut. Raducanu’s victory marked the first three-set match she has played despite having won a grand slam and reached the fourth round at Wimbledon. Since she arrived in Australia, she has been spending nearly 12 hours on site each day, to the bemusement of her team. “I don’t even hang out and talk to anyone. I’m just doing training. And then in between having lunch, recovery, and then training again. And then gym and then more recovery. So I’m here from 8.30 to 7.30. I don’t know what’s happening.” A newcomer in the locker room, Raducanu says she has been speaking in Mandarin with Chinese players, some of whom have lockers situated near her own, and also her close friend Gabriela Ruse of Romania. Otherwise, she keeps to herself. “I think everyone’s still very nice to me. I mean, going into the locker room, I’m not really hanging out so much. But I’m kind of just at the club to get my business done and then leave even though my business takes 12 hours,” she said, laughing. Raducanu has also been taking inspiration from Andy Murray’s fighting spirit after the Scot survived a gruelling five-set battle with Nikoloz Basilashvili. She told the PA news agency: “When I was in the third set I actually thought: ‘Andy was up a set then he got pushed to five but he fought back so hard and took the decider’, so, when I went to three, I was also thinking: ‘Actually, I can fight back and win, fight like he did’. I was definitely inspired by him.” Meanwhile, Raducanu continues to grow accustomed to her coaching partnership with Torben Beltz. The German is well known for motivating his charges with forfeits and rewards. Raducanu says he has been offering acai bowls and mints for drills well done, and she has been impressed with his positivity. “He brings some great positive energy. So to have that in your corner is definitely an uplifting thing. And when we’re working, for example, last week after a loss, he was like, straight back on it. He was happy, he wasn’t dwelling on it at all. So I think that was great for me to feed off.”",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu used heavy defeat to fuel good start at Australian Open,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/mma-raducanu-good-start-australian-open-helped-by-reaction-to-adversity
1/20/2022,"The Premier League is planning to revise its controversial Covid regulations which have caused the postponement of 22 fixtures over the past five weeks. Rules could be changed for the round of fixtures beginning on 8 February, with the league crediting a recent fall in the number of positive Covid tests among players and staff.  Discussions have taken place with clubs but no changes are expected before this weekend’s matches. Teams will then go on a planned winter break between 24 January and 3 February, with the FA Cup fourth round running from 4-7 February. A shareholders’ meeting could be held next week and any rule change would require the support of 14 or more clubs. Regulations on Covid suspensions were agreed by clubs, who voted them through at a board meeting last year, but they have become the subject of dispute, with Tottenham releasing a statement criticising the decision to postpone their game at home to Arsenal last weekend and calling for “clarity and consistency on the application of the rule”. Spurs said that whereas “the original intention of the guidance was to deal with player availability directly affected by Covid cases”, the “unintended consequences” of the rule meant that decisions were being taken due to “player availability unrelated to Covid”. On Wednesday Mikel Arteta defended Arsenal’s decision to apply for a postponement. “We got to a point where we could not make a squad available with the numbers required in this league to play a game,” the manager said. “That’s why we did not play; it’s as simple as that.” The rules as laid out do allow games to be called off for injuries unrelated to Covid, if they contribute to an overall shortage of players. Applications are considered by the league when a team cannot field 13 outfield players and a goalkeeper from “either its squad list or its appropriately experienced Under-21 players”. The league says its medical team scrutinises all requests and will go back to clubs if they feel there is insufficient clarity on the status of players’ fitness. A Premier League spokesperson said: “The Premier League is consulting with our clubs regarding Covid-19 postponement rules and guidance in light of the changing national picture and the falling number of cases within our squads. “The League’s current guidance was amended in December following the emergence of the new Omicron variant and we continue to monitor the ongoing effects of the virus and will update our guidance accordingly.”",Sport/Football,Premier League plans to bring in new Covid postponement rules,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/19/premier-league-plans-to-bring-in-new-covid-postponement-rules
1/20/2022,"Novak Djokovic is the controlling shareholder in a Danish biotech firm aiming to develop a treatment for Covid-19 that does not involve vaccination, it has emerged. The world No 1, who was deported from Australia this week after the government cancelled his visa in a dispute over a medical exemption relating to his unvaccinated status, bought an 80% stake in QuantBioRes in 2020.  Ivan Loncarevic, the company’s chief executive, confirmed the investment to Reuters. He subsequently told the Financial Times that he had not spoken to Djokovic, who has won more than $150m in prize money, since November and that the tennis star was “not anti-vax”. Djokovic flew out of Australia on Sunday after losing a legal challenge to overturn the cancellation of his visa by Alex Hawke, the country’s immigration minister, who said Djokovic’s presence in Australia might risk “civil unrest” as he was a “talisman of anti-vaccination sentiment”. QuantBioRes has about 11 researchers working in Denmark, Australia and Slovenia, according to Loncarevic, who stressed the company was working on a treatment, not a vaccine. The company’s website says it started developing a “deactivation mechanism” for Covid-19 in July 2020. Djokovic, who may also be barred from defending his French Open title in Roland Garros in May after the French government ruled on Monday that all athletes will have to be vaccinated in order to attend and compete in sporting events, acquired his stake in the company in June 2020. The company is developing a peptide, which inhibits the coronavirus from infecting the human cell, and it expects to launch clinical trials in Britain this summer, Loncarevic said. A spokesperson for Djokovic did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",Sport/Sport,Djokovic has 80% stake in biotech firm developing Covid drug,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/novak-djokovic-stake-biotech-firm-quantbiores-covid
