1/25/2022,"At least 23 people were indicted in connection to pre-planned car accidents, according to the DOJ. They made almost $1 million in insurance claims between 2017 and 2020, according to the indictment. Four of the defendants are considered fugitives and have yet to be taken into custody. The Federal Bureau of Investigation indicted 23 people on more than 100 counts in connection to approximately 14 pre-arranged car accidents that earned them an estimated $1 million in insurance claims, according to a Monday press release. The defendants face 138 counts in total, according to the press release from the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Washington. If convicted, they could spend up to 55 years in prison — 20 years for ""conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud,"" an additional 20 years for ""conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding,"" 10 years for ""conspiracy to commit health care fraud,"" and five years for ""making false statements to the FBI,"" according to the release. According to an 81-page indictment filed last month, the defendants are accused of planning the collisions, orchestrating them mostly on secluded roads where only the accused defendants could be witnesses to the crash, fraudulently making insurance claims, and fabricating or exaggerating injuries between July 4, 2017, and September 25, 2020. In some instances, there were no drivers or passengers in at least one of the cars — in which case they used a weighted object to ensure the car's airbag deployed — and hammers were used to break windows of vehicles, according to the indictment. The defendants range from 20 to 51 years old and hail from Washington, California, Michigan, and Nevada, as well as one defendant from British Columbia, Canada. Four of the individuals have yet to be arrested and are currently considered fugitives, according to the press release. Attorney Alexander H. Fuqua who represents four of the 23 individuals told Insider in an email that the believes the government's case is ""overreaching."" ""From what had been shared with me, the evidence against the people I've represented mainly rely on hearsay statements with scant direct evidence,"" Fuqua said. The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Attorneys representing the other 19 defendants were not immediately available to respond to Insider's emails.

1/25/2022,"As Russian troops ominously mass on Ukraine’s border and the U.S. and NATO steel for a possible invasion, Donald Trump Jr. can think of only one possible culprit (who has not occurred to anyone else): Hunter Biden. “Will it ultimately be Hunter’s lucrative and shady AF business dealings in Ukraine that gets us into a war with Russia?” Trump Jr. wondered, without offering a single reason why that would be the case. In fact, it was his dad who bragged as president about his friendship with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, the clear aggressor in the Ukraine situation, and who accepted Putin’s denials of Kremlin interference in the 2016 U.S. election despite the findings of his own intelligence officials. Former President Donald Trump also denounced Ukraine — and was impeached for threatening to withhold vital military assistance to stave off a Russian incursion unless Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, launched a baseless investigation into presidential candidate Joe Biden’s son Hunter. Hunter Biden was on the board of directors of a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, for five years, ending in 2019. The Trump campaign tried to paint Hunter Biden as a schemer who hoped to leverage his father’s possible influence, but no connections to corruption ever surfaced, and now a connection to a possible Russian invasion appears even more outlandish. Even Florida businessman Lev Parnas, a Ukrainian-born American linked to Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, reminded Donald Jr. that it was his father who was “impeached because he held back military aid to Ukraine.” Parnas has admitted working with Giuliani to try to pressure Ukrainian officials to launch an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden in 2019. Parnas, who has said Donald Trump knew everything they were doing, was convicted last October of illegally funneling money from a Russian financier to Republican politicians in the U.S., among other charges. Did you forget that is was your father(#TFG) who got impeached because he held back military aid to Ukraine because @ZelenskyyUa refused to announce an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden! #LevRemembershttps://t.co/90eTKQQ15Z — Lev Parnas (@levparnas) January 24, 2022 Other critics on Twitter had a field day. “Russia, if you’re listening,” said Trump, looking directly into a television camera, “I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.”Tampa, FL July 27, 2016 — Walter Blake (@WalterBlake1) January 24, 2022 Golden Book that didn't quite make the cut pic.twitter.com/97fPFXdMuU — Brown Eyed Susan (@smc429) January 24, 2022 AHA!
