1/17/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s deportation from Australia on the eve of the Australian Open is bad for tennis and an avoidable issue that could have been addressed long ago, Andy Murray has said. “It’s a tough one for [Djokovic],” said the Scot, speaking moments after the decision to cancel the world No 1’s visa and deport him from Australia was upheld by the courts. “Obviously, it’s not ideal for the tournament, either. I just think, overall, the whole situation has been bad for the sport.”  Murray continued: “Now I hope the tennis is what gets spoken about, and what the players are doing on the court, and all the good stories that are happening. It just feels like the whole thing could have been avoided, or maybe addressed a number of months ago, rather than like it all happening right at the last moment.” One such event filled with good stories, that was overshadowed by Djokovic’s unfolding visa drama, was Murray’s run to the final of the Sydney International, just his second ATP final since 2017. He defeated two top 25 players, Reilly Opelka and Nikoloz Basilashvili before losing in the final to Aslan Karatsev, the top seed. Murray will again face Basilashvili, the 21st seed, in the first round of the Australian Open. The last time Murray was in Melbourne it is fair to say that a few things happened. By the beginning of 2019, Murray had been struggling badly with his left hip for two years, unable to even put on his socks without significant pain let alone contest gruelling five-set tennis matches. He announced in an emotional press conference before the tournament that retirement appeared to be on the horizon and after a classic, unforgettable first-round defeat against Roberto Bautista Agut, the tournament held a mini-retirement ceremony for him. It seemed to be the end. Murray says he does not remember much about what happened after the match, but the buildup to the event was evidently unforgettable. He spent the off-season having frank conversations with his family about the constant pain he was in which was hard to forget. “I’m still surprised that I was able to perform like I did with the lack of practice and preparation, and also how bad my body was feeling at the time. And yeah, it’s a great memory. Obviously, it turned out not to be my last match which I’m really happy about but it certainly could have been. Yeah, it would have been fine. It would have been a good way to finish.” On the subject of the ideal retirement, Murray says he has not thought about it much but he is honest and frank about how increasingly difficult the tour is for a man of his age with a family. “For me, it is becoming harder, like leaving the family and stuff, I find that more difficult now than what I did a couple of years ago. For example, if I had another injury again, which was going to be like a long rehab, or whatever, something happened to the hip, obviously, that would be the end.” Instead of heading home to contemplate the end of his career, Murray underwent hip resurfacing surgery as a new stage of his career began. He says, when comparing those days with now, that it is particularly pleasant not to wake up in pain any more. “Now, I sort of know that, yeah, like the end could be any time really now. So I’m just trying to make the most of every opportunity in terms of my performance and the kind of results whereas in 2019 it’s a good job I didn’t win that match as I wouldn’t have been able to play the next round. Here I can go in and physically I’m in a pretty good place.” The question for Murray remains exactly how good this place is and what his potential is at 34 years old and with a metal hip. Although he was battered by Karatsev in the Sydney final, he played at a high level, particularly in the vintage manner that he dismantled Opelka’s enormous serve in the final two sets of their semi-final. The second half of last season was the first time since 2017 that Murray was able to play regularly and build up his form with every tournament. It was a mixed bag of results: he clinched two top-10 wins in the indoor season, he was competitive against most top opponents and he demonstrated that he still possesses his particular combination of movement, intelligence and elite returning to at least mix with the best. But while his level clearly grew throughout last year, he was ultimately unable to piece together wins and move deeper in tournaments. He either struggled to perform in a consistent string of matches, or else he engaged in far too many long matches that robbed him of the ability to move efficiently through tournament draws. That he has registered a deep run so early in the season was an essential reaffirmation of the positive direction he continues to move in and how much more there could be to come.",Sport/Sport,Andy Murray in ‘pretty good place’ physically on Australian Open return,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/16/andy-murray-in-pretty-good-place-physically-on-australian-open-return
1/17/2022,"Am I alone in meeting news of a solo project by Sue Perkins with delight tempered by anxiety? Delight because I find her a very companionable companion on whatever televisual journey we are about to undertake together – warm, witty, and perceptive without ever veering into condescension or cynicism. And anxiety in case this means that she and Mel Giedroyc have fallen out. As a pair they were closing in on national treasure status during the Bake Off years and the sight of such enduring friendship – the powerful suggestion that once off camera, these two women now in their early 50s, could still enjoy being absolute idiots together – was, and remains important to me. So this is the new outing for what I shall – unless otherwise informed by eight independent sources – cleave to thinking of as the latter half of emotionally inviolate duo Mel and Sue. This time Sue is travelling across California and Colorado as the presenter of Sue Perkins’ Big American Road Trip (Channel 4), setting off from just outside San Francisco in a fairly basic one-person caravan to experience the great outdoors (the girl from Croydon is rightly awed by the sheer size and spectacle on offer along the Pacific Coast Highway) and to talk to people along the way who have, through choice or necessity, taken up #vanlife.  It is mainly those who have taken up the nomadic life by choice who are responsible for the hashtag. Instagram is full of curated grids of (mostly) twentysomethings who have opted out of the rat race and headed out on to the open road and all the opportunities for personal growth and filtered sunset shots it offers. Perkins, fortunately/carefully/generously (delete according to taste and your own weary cynicism levels), finds representatives of the least performative strand of the movement to interview. First come sweet young couple Blix and Bess, who are such wholesome Americans that it is charming to watch them try to work out what to do in the face of a riff by Sue about pubic hair in communal showers. “We’ve gone down a conversational cul-de-sac of my own making,” says Sue, when she realises. The pair are disarmingly honest about their desire to see all the touristy places that they would never have been able to afford to visit in a traditional manner, but also insightful about the more intangible benefits itinerant life has brought. Blix noticed how long it took to relax into the fact that people were just being friendly, often trying to share knowledge and experiences with newcomers – “and I was the jerk rejecting their energy”. Near Yosemite, Sue meets Alexandria, who has garnered 300,000 online followers during her seven years of van living. She shows Sue how best to dig a poo hole. “It’s so small,” says Sue. “Which means I have supplementary questions.” The last third of the programme is dedicated to older campers, who tend to be those who began living a version of #vanlife because circumstances required it. The mood among the community that has cohered around Bob Wells, made famous by his appearance in the Frances McDormand film Nomadland, is quiet, careful and tinged with sadness. Sue doesn’t press them on their individual reasons for coming to this life but it is evident – particularly among the women – that the past casts long shadows and that to live without trappings is not always to be wholly free. The programme is a standard gentle travelogue format done well. A presenter who manages to be irreverent without being disrespectful, who can engage at the right level with any interviewee and ad-lib jokes whenever things might otherwise flag, is always a joy. A willingness to improvise a burlesque routine (alongside Bess, who is a dancer) as “Perry Menopause” is also to be commended. As a fellow south-east Londoner also with “a pelvic floor like wet plasterboard” I can only salute La Perkins and wish her well on her way through Colorado next week, which is – in all but the strictly geographical sense – just about the furthest place from Catford or Croydon there is.",Arts/Television & radio,Sue Perkins’ Big American Road Trip review – a joyful insight into poky caravans,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/16/sue-perkins-big-american-road-trip-review-a-joyful-insight-into-poky-caravans
1/17/2022,"“The plan? I don’t know ... to win,” Carlo Ancelotti had said, and that was what happened. Real Madrid have their first trophy of his second coming. It is a minor one, sure, taken from Spain to Saudi Arabia, but it seems unlikely to be the last. Not least because of the way they claimed the Super Cup: goals from Luka Modric and Karim Benzema inside the first hour were ultimately enough on a night where they had seemed to be easing their way to success, and then Thibaut Courtois appeared just at the moment when it looked like, actually, they might not. The Belgian had just made a couple of saves from substitute Nico Serrano as Athletic Bilbao rebelled against a fate that seemed pre-written and looked for a lifeline in the final 15 minutes. They had been getting a little closer with every minute, “warming me up” as Courtois put it afterwards, and now it seemed they had it when Eder Militão blocked Raúl García’s header with his hand and was sent off. There were five minutes left and Athletic had a penalty. “If they had scored that we would have had seven or eight minutes of heart attacks,” the goalkeeper said.  García hit it to Courtois’s left as he went to the right, but he reacted fast and managed to save it with his left foot, sending the ball way into the air and Madrid to the title – lifted by the club captain Marcelo, sent on late to do the honours. For Athletic, this was a fourth final in a year but the third in a row they had lost. These two teams, historic clubs in Spain, where they have never been out of the first division, had not met in a final since 1958. Now Athletic handed back the Super Cup they had won against Barcelona this time 12 months ago. Madrid had done it their way, which is many ways really and certainly includes the goalkeeper. After a semi-final in which Barcelona had more of the ball but Madrid made it through, Fede Valverde running from his area to the other in extra-time, Ancelotti had sought to decriminalise the counterattack. In a way too few managers have been prepared to do, he calmly admitted that, yes, his team does quite often play on the break. But not always and, besides, with the players and the pace they have got, why wouldn’t they? “I’m not going to win every game on the counter and if I play possession I’m not going to either,” he said, “Let people say we play on the break: I’m delighted, because it’s not so easy, nor so simple.” Especially if your opponents have ideas that are not so different. That might have suggested a meeting in which Athletic and Madrid cancelled each other out, waiting deep for an offensive that never arrived, hoping for the chance to break. Instead the first half of this game was open and enjoyable. Both sides were indeed prepared to run, but that was not the only mode of progression, especially in Madrid’s case. The second half was largely a non-event until that final 15 minutes, Ancelotti’s team seemingly comfortably in control until the closing minutes. Athletic alternated between waiting and pressing high. They also began moves deep, drawing Madrid in, and there was a clarity about their attacks, willing to go for their opponents when the space was created. David Alaba twice had to slide in on Iñaki Williams: once sweeping the ball with his hand, the palm on the floor precluding it being a penalty. And if Madrid have athletes, they also have aesthetes: almost a decade on, that midfield is still perhaps the best, Modric still defying space and time. So of course is Benzema, better even than when Ancelotti last had him. Vinicius, unusually quiet here, gives them velocity but they are happy in possession too, shown when Toni Kroos dribbled his way out of the area on nine minutes and when the move that gave them the lead started with Courtois. Kroos and Casemiro were involved before Modric spread it right, where Rodrygo was running. Athletic backed off to their box, where the Brazilian laid it to Modric, who bent a superb shot into the corner. Madrid, gently tightening the screw as the first half went on, had a lead which doubled at the start of the second half when Yeray Álvarez threw himself into block a Benzema shot with his arm. Benzema put the penalty away and for a while it felt a little like everyone knew this was over. Madrid seemed to be enjoying it, just playing. Which Athletic couldn’t find the space or enough of the ball to do. And yet the danger hadn’t gone. In part perhaps because the belief that it had, Madrid dropping deeper and seemingly content just to see out time; certainly because this is Athletic, a team with limitations but no lack of pride. Yeray headed into the side-netting. Iñigo Martínez’s free-kick hit the wall. And then Serrano had his two efforts. Saving those was simple enough for Courtois. The penalty was different, but somehow he stopped that too, the man against whom Ancelotti took the European Cup eight years ago ensuring the first of a new era with some familiar old faces.",Sport/Football,Modric helps Real Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao to win Spanish Super Cup,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/16/real-madrid-athletic-bilbao-spanish-super-cup-final
