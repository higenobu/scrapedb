3/8/2022,"Donald Trump’s attorney general William Barr told the former US president he was “like a bull in a bull ring” and “someone’s going to come and put a sword through your head”. In return, Trump called his former attorney general a “horse” who had been “broken” by the radical left. Such was the state of debate in the upper echelons of the Republican party on Monday as it digested the latest round of reporting from Barr’s promotion of his memoir One Damn Thing After Another, which will be published on Tuesday. It has been extensively trailed – including by the Guardian. On the page, Barr repeatedly describes disagreements with Trump and tactics used by senior aides including then secretary of state Mike Pompeo to distract or obstruct the erratic and often furious president. Speaking to NPR, Barr repeated a passage in his book when he said: “At one point, I said to [Trump]: ‘You know, Mr President, you’re like a bull in a bull ring and your adversaries have your number. They know how to get under your skin, and all they have to do is wave a red flag over here and you go charging and attack it.’ “And I said, ‘At the end of the day, you’re going to be in the middle of the ring sweating and someone’s going to come and put a sword through your head. “He didn’t think much of that metaphor.” Trump evidently no longer thinks much of Barr. This weekend, the former president wrote a lengthy letter to Lester Holt, the NBC anchor who interviewed Barr on TV. “Bill Barr cares more about the corrupt Washington media and elite than serving the American people,” Trump wrote, as reported by Axios. “He was slow, lethargic, and I realised early on that he never had what it takes to make a great attorney general. When the radical left Democrats threatened to hold him in contempt and even worse, impeach him, he became virtually worthless for law and order and election integrity. They broke him just like a trainer breaks a horse.” Trump also said: “I would imagine that if the book is anything like him, it will be long, slow and very boring.” Critics might disagree. Reviewing the book for the Washington Post, Devlin Barrett said that though Barr’s book was self-serving, he “was easily Trump’s most effective and important cabinet member” and his memoir showed he could “tell a good yarn and has a penchant for deadpan punchlines”. That said, Barrett wrote, Barr had really written “a defense of his tenure to fellow conservatives”. “Barr bided his time before taking one last swing,” Barrett said. “But as long as there are senior officials like Barr, there will be presidents like Trump.” The book has produced a flood of other media reports, including that Barr thinks Trump should not be the Republican nominee for president in 2024 and criticism that the two-time attorney general is seeking to whitewash his role in some of Trump’s most controversial moments. In the book, Barr defends his handling of the investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. In particular, he focuses on his decision to release a summary of the report by Robert Mueller. In that letter, Barr cleared Trump of seeking to obstruct justice despite the special counsel laying out 10 possible instances of such potentially criminal behavior. Speaking to NBC in interviews broadcast on Sunday and Monday, Barr repeated his conclusion that Trump’s claims of voter fraud in his defeat by Joe Biden were baseless – he has used the word “bullshit” – while skating over criticism for using the Department of Justice to investigate such lies. He said Trump was “responsible in the broad sense of that word” for the deadly Capitol riot that grew from his refusal to concede defeat and over which he was impeached, a second time, for inciting an insurrection. “It appears that part of the plan was to send this group up to the Hill,” Barr said, of the storming of Congress by Trump supporters around which seven people died. “I think the whole idea was to intimidate Congress. And I think that that was wrong.” But he also said: “I haven’t seen anything to say he was legally responsible for it in terms of incitement.” Barr also addressed an incident he left out of his book: the firing of a US attorney in New York, Geoffrey Berman, who was supervising investigations of Trump associates and business affairs as well as an investigation of a Turkish bank which the Turkish president asked Trump to drop. “I didn’t think there was any threat to the president,” Barr told NBC, adding that the decision to can Berman “was my call”. “I hadn’t really thought much of him,” he said. “I wanted to make the change.” Barr remains a staunch conservative. On Monday, he told NBC that despite it all, if Trump was the Republican nominee in 2024, he would vote for him.",News/US news,Bull session: Barr and Trump exchange blows over book and electoral fraud lie ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/07/barr-trump-exchange-blows-book-electoral-lie
3/8/2022,"England may be trying to turn a corner West Indies know only too well, and thoughts of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad kicking their heels at home will take some shifting by their replacements, but the three-Test series that begins at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium on Tuesday has a greater significance. On Sunday evening, the newly minted Richards-Botham Trophy was unveiled by the two cricketing titans who made their debuts together for Somerset in 1974, shared an apparently riotous flat in Taunton and have been like brothers ever since. Richards, 70 on Monday, remains in incredible physical nick, as if he could swagger out to the middle this week with gum in mouth and bat in hand ready to strike the fear of God into his opponents; Ian Botham, four years younger but fuller in figure and with the hobbling gait of an old bowler, would probably still back himself. When has he ever not? Their fortunes during past battles may see some quibble here. Richards dominated England back in the day, a Test average of 62 against them his highest of all teams faced, but Botham less so against the great West Indies team he rates as the best in history. But the renaming of the trophy – if slightly unnecessary given the backstory of the Wisden Trophy and Learie Constantine’s involvement – is about a celebration of friendship between cricket in the Caribbean and England. This was certainly in evidence two years ago when West Indies unflinchingly answered English cricket’s SOS, flying their Test team to the UK during the height of the pandemic. The players took a 50% pay cut in order to help out a board that struggles financially during the good times, let alone when the world has stopped, and the conditions they met were unprecedented. It involved a tour spent in elaborate, restrictive biosecure bubbles at a time when no vaccine for Covid-19 existed. Reticence would have been understandable – indeed, three players opted out – but those who made the trip were impeccable, uncomplaining guests who pulled off a handsome win in the first Test and led the way for other international teams, including their women’s side, to follow. By helping to get the TV money flowing they saved the England and Wales Cricket Board from catastrophe. This debt of gratitude is the reason why the latest encounter, originally slated for two Tests and three Twenty20s, has been fleshed out to three Tests plus the five Twenty20s that took place a few weeks ago. As such, regular grumbles from aficionados about the use of more tourist-friendly islands – Antigua, Barbados and Grenada – and the growing absences from the traditional territories of Jamaica, Guyana and Trinidad should probably be parked this time. If this is the schedule deemed to generate the most money for Cricket West Indies, a board currently $23m (£17.5m) in debt, then who are the visitors to say otherwise? Even if CWI hits its target of $70m in revenues this year, this is still a fraction of the £207m they helped the ECB to secure in 2020/21. Judging by the tour’s first week in Antigua, the estimated 5,000 travelling fans (with more expected to follow in Barbados) will be welcome. The tourism industry is slowly coming back to life on the island but a good number of businesses have not survived the ill-wind of the pandemic and there are some empty hotels starting to be overtaken by foliage rather than Britons and North Americans with bulging wallets. Resilience is the hallmark of the region, however, and cricket-wise this has been needed. The regional four-day competition has only just returned after a two-year absence but though West Indies are languishing in eighth place in the Test rankings, they represent a stiff challenge for an England side that sit below them in the World Test Championship ladder (AKA rock bottom) and are trying to shake off a seven-week post-Ashes postmortem and reboot Joe Root’s captaincy. History says as much, with England claiming one series win in the Caribbean from 10 since 1968. Three years ago, they were completely overwhelmed by a four-pronged pace attack in Barbados and Antigua for a convincing series defeat only mildly offset by a dead-rubber win in St Lucia with Jason Holder, then captain, banned for a slow over-rate and Mark Wood deliver a breakthrough spell of searing pace. There remain concerns over the home side’s batting but Kraigg Brathwaite, who has since taken over as captain, comes into the series in form after a career-best 276 versus Jamaica last month. Holder is a world-class all-rounder, Kemar Roach is 19 wickets away from becoming the sixth West Indian to 250, while in Jayden Seales, the 20-year-old Trinidiadan, they possess a hugely promising, tall, aggressive quick who serves as a reminder of how verdant the Caribbean remains talent-wise. There is a good deal of local surprise England have deemed the elite standards of Anderson and Broad to be surplus to requirements. Richards said he was amazed the pair were left out of the first Ashes Test in Brisbane and figured there must be serious talent coming through. Now, Antigua’s most famous son believes his old team have a “wonderful opportunity” in their absence, describing England as “a little bit flat”. Root’s attack – most likely Chris Woakes, Craig Overton, Wood and Jack Leach initially, with Ollie Robinson yet again unfit – must therefore prove this prediction wrong, while a rejigged batting order with Alex Lees making his debut as opener simply has an initial target of passing 300 for the first time this winter. But whatever the outcome and any repercussions that follow, friendship should be the overriding theme of this tour.",Sport/Sport,Friendship between West Indies and England has a new name,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/07/friendship-west-indies-england-richards-botham-trophy
3/8/2022,"Boris Johnson has said the UK may have to increase its domestic gas and oil production in order to wean itself off Russian resources, despite the opposition of climate campaigners and some scepticism in the cabinet. The prime minister said the UK was looking at increasing North Sea output, although critics say it would take two decades to ramp up significantly and would have little immediate effect on the impending rise in domestic energy bills. Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Johnson said: “One of the things we are looking at is the possibility of using more of our own hydrocarbons, and you’ll have heard already about what the business secretary has had to say about licences for UK domestic production. “That doesn’t mean we are abandoning our commitment to reducing CO2 … We have got to reflect the reality that there is a crunch on at the moment. We need to intensify our self-reliance as a transition with more hydrocarbons.” Johnson said he would be setting out an energy supply strategy in the days ahead “so that people have a sense of how we are going to meet people’s needs over the short, medium and long term”. He insisted the increased focus on North Sea production would not undermine the UK’s push for net zero, but claimed it was a necessary move to ease the transition to renewables and nuclear. Standing alongside Justin Trudeau, the Canadian prime minister, and Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, he said a ban on Russian fossil fuels was “very much on the table”. But he also agreed with Rutte that it could not be immediate and needed to be done “step by step”, with countries each going at their own pace. Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, global oil and gas prices have climbed, with the price of Brent crude at $139 a barrel – its highest level in 14 years – bringing the average petrol price to a record high of 155p a litre. The price of gas has soared by 70% since Friday to 800p a therm – 20 times its level two years ago. The extraction of oil and gas off the coast of the UK may be more economically viable with high oil and gas prices. However, climate campaigners gave a scathing verdict. Greenpeace UK’s head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, said: “Boris Johnson is right that we urgently need to end our dependence on Russian gas, but more drilling in the North Sea is not the solution. It could take a quarter of a century to open up new gas fields, and the product will then be sold to the highest bidder on the global market, having no impact on our energy bills. It makes a lot more sense to reduce our gas dependence by insulating homes, installing heat pumps and boosting renewables. Some cabinet ministers who support the push for net zero are concerned that Tories opposed to the target are using Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to undermine climate goals. The Times reported on Monday that Johnson was prepared to give gas companies a “climate pass” in order to increase reliance on the fossil fuel while the west weans off Russian gas, even at the expense of climate change targets. A source close to one pro-net zero cabinet minister said: “There’s been a resurgence of this kind of argument, but it’s for the birds that anything is going to change. Every G7 country has a net zero target, and we now know, given the circumstances in Ukraine, that getting to net zero is very much in the interests of national security.” Another cabinet source said it made sense to continue North Sea production as it was better to have gas supply domestically than elsewhere, but highlighted that “gas is expensive, and more expensive than any renewable”, adding that there was no quick fix for the problem of high prices. The climate change committee, which advises the government on reaching net zero and other targets, has said the best way of reducing the UK’s exposure to volatile prices was cutting fossil fuel consumption. Overall, it backed a tighter limit on production and a presumption against exploration. “Any increases in UK extraction of oil and gas would have, at most, a marginal effect on the prices faced by UK consumers in future,” it said. However, it has also said the evidence is not clear-cut as UK extraction has a “relatively low carbon footprint [more clearly for gas than for oil] and the UK will continue to be a net importer of fossil fuels for the foreseeable future, implying there may be emissions advantages to UK production replacing imports”. It also highlighted energy security factors.",News/Environment,Johnson hints UK oil and gas output must rise to cut dependence on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/07/johnson-hints-oil-and-gas-output-must-rise-to-wean-uk-off-russian-supplies
3/8/2022,"David Chidgey, who has died aged 79, was the Liberal Democrat MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, for 11 years from 1994 onwards, and a peer from 2005. With a professional background as a chartered engineer, after entering the House of Commons he quickly became the party’s spokesman on transport at a time when the privatisation of British Rail was being debated fiercely. At various times he was also the party’s spokesman on employment, and on training, trade and industry. In 2005 he led the successful campaign that blocked plans by major high street banks to increase charges significantly at cash dispensing machines, which would have disproportionally affected poorer people. During his last four years in the Commons he was a member of the Speaker’s panel, occasionally deputising for the Speaker. Prior to politics Chidgey had been involved as an engineer in major projects to build up water, electricity supplies and transport networks in west Africa, Oman, Bangladesh, Brazil and the Middle East. In parliament he developed his long interest in Africa and became a member of the select committee on foreign affairs. Once he moved to the House of Lords he became the LibDems’ frontbench spokesman on African development and on human rights issues. In 2010 he contributed an article to the Guardian on the difficulties of the countries of Africa’s Great Lakes region. His expertise was recognised by a number of institutes and thinktanks, including the Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit, where he became chair of its oversight committee (2008-11). Born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, David was the son of Winifred (nee Weston) and Cecil Chidgey, an army officer. He attended Brune Park county high school in Gosport and went on to study mechanical and aeronautical engineering as a civilian student at the Admiralty College in Portsmouth, graduating in 1964. He then studied civil engineering at Portsmouth Polytechnic (now the University of Portsmouth). After he met April Idris-Jones, a probation officer, in a jazz club, the couple married in 1965 and had a son, David, and two daughters, Joanna and Caitlin. Chidgey’s initial employment was with Hampshire county council (1965-72) on traffic engineering projects, before going into the private sector, which is when he began his involvement in overseas projects. His professional expertise was recognised by a number of awards, including a fellowship of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Committed to his native Hampshire, Chidgey was elected to his local New Alresford town council in 1976 and then to Winchester city council in 1987. He had wider aspirations than local government, however, and while in the middle of fighting the Hampshire Central European parliament byelection in autumn 1988, he approached the LibDems’ regional chair with a view to becoming a parliamentary candidate. He was adopted by the party for the Eastleigh constituency in 1992, adjacent to his Winchester home, winning it at the second attempt in February 1994 at a byelection triggered by the death of the Conservative MP Stephen Milligan. Chidgey held the seat twice thereafter (in 1997 and 2001), before retiring at the 2005 general election and entering the Lords. As well as international matters, he was active in debates on issues that affected his locality, including through parliamentary speeches on the protection of chalk streams that flowed through Hampshire. His last speech, towards the end of 2021, came in a debate on amendments to the environment bill, in which he played a part in the government’s climbdown in favour of stronger action by water companies on sewage control. Chidgey was a diligent caseworker and a thoughtful and thorough problem solver who was happy to be approached informally by his constituents. His internationalism and attention to environmental issues made him a natural Liberal, and he was much respected by his parliamentary colleagues. He was actively involved in the National Liberal Club, serving on its general committee. He is survived by April, his three children and two grandchildren.

3/8/2022,"A rare brown bear who became famous after breaking into a bakery and feasting on the biscuits has been captured in the central Italian region of Abruzzo, sparking criticism from animal activists. The marsican bear, affectionately known as Juan Carrito by residents in the mountain town of Roccaraso, has been taken to an enclosure for “problem” animals. The two-year-old bear had been tranquillised and banished to a remote area of the national park of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise after his midnight feast at the bakery in early December. But a week later the animal returned to Roccaraso, a ski resort, where he was filmed in the snow shrugging off a dog biting and barking around him. Juan Carrito has been seen in Roccaraso on several other occasions over the past two years, strolling along the streets and drinking from fountains. He was recently spotted near the train station and on Sunday afternoon was captured after being enticed with bait to walk into a “tube trap” – a device commonly used to capture bears. The animal was put to sleep with anaesthetic and taken to the Palena bear reserve in the province of Chieti. The authorities said that while it was a difficult decision, capturing the bear was necessary due to its “confident” behaviour, and for its own protection. “The intervention was necessary to protect the bear and keep it away from potentially dangerous situations and, in general, from an environment where it has been feeding almost exclusively on waste for too long,” said Lucio Zazzara, the president of the Maiella national park, a home to marsican brown bears. Juan Carrito’s stay at Palena, where he will be monitored around the clock by video surveillance, is expected to be temporary. “Now the priority is to work on its return to nature by implementing the procedures that will enable this to happen,” added Zazzara. Over 600 people had signed a petition against the bear’s capture. “Juan Carrito never harmed anyone,” said Luigi Liberatore, the Roccaraso resident who started the petition. The marsican is a critically endangered subspecies of the brown bear living in the Apennine mountains that straddle Italy’s Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise regions. In 2019, the Italian branch of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) warned that the animal faced extinction. The population has dwindled during the past 25 years, with 63% of bear deaths attributed to illegal hunting or being hit by vehicles. Marsican brown bears often gravitate towards towns during the autumn and winter in search of food. They are usually females with cubs or young bears. WWF Italy said Juan Carrito’s capture represented an “alarm signal” for those who care about the species. “Even in the awareness that this complex situation has no simple solutions, it remains to be asked if everything was done to avoid this sad move.”",News/World news,Rare Italian bear famous for bakery break-in captured,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/rare-italian-bear-famous-for-bakery-break-in-captured
3/8/2022,"Policing attracts some men who want “to exert and coerce” vulnerable people, the new national police lead on violence against women has admitted, as she urged officers to create a “call-out culture” to tackle sexist and misogynistic behaviour. Deputy chief constable Maggie Blyth, who took up the post of national lead for violence against women and girls (VAWG) at the National Police Chiefs’ Council five months ago, said it was wrong to dismiss abusive, violent or sexist officers as a “few bad apples”. She added that policing scandals of the past 12 months, including the rape and murder of Sarah Everard by a serving police officer, had been a “stark check”. “That was so shocking to policing that it rocked the whole of the service in a way that we really hadn’t seen since the murder of Stephen Lawrence,” said Blyth in an interview with the Guardian to mark International Women’s Day on Tuesday. “It felt, and continues to feel, like a watershed moment.” Asked whether recent scandals such as revelations of deeply sexist and racist WhatsApp messages from officers demonstrated that the police were institutionally misogynistic, Blyth said policing reflected the “misogyny and sexism problem” found in society. But she added that policing, like other jobs with access to power, could attract people who wanted to “use their power in a corrupt and criminal way”. “There will be some attracted into working in policing, because of the powers that it offers them, the powers to exert and coerce other people, particularly vulnerable individuals. I think we shouldn’t be naive to that,” she said. While proper vetting of officers was vital, it could only provide a “spotlight for a moment” on a potential recruit’s conduct, she said. Fellow officers had to be “upstanders, not bystanders” and feel supported and obliged to take action if they witnessed unacceptable behaviour. Blyth acknowledged that scandals including the jailing of two Met officers for taking pictures of the dead bodies of two sisters had a “significant” impact on women’s trust and confidence in the police. “As much as we are going after dangerous men in society and prioritising VAWG, we are going after dangerous men in policing,” she said. But she insisted that an increasingly vocal and confident majority of officers wanted to change discriminatory cultures – adding that 42% of new recruits were now women, a record level, while 11.8% were from minority ethnic backgrounds. “I see a workforce really angry and upset at the misogynist, racist, disrespectful behaviours of some of their colleagues and I see officers really wanting to demonstrate how different they are,” she said. But Blyth is aware that she is not the first police leader to promise that lessons have been learned, and police culture is changing. She expects more scandals to emerge, adding that the public perception of policing of violence against women is likely to get worse before it gets better as whistleblowers exposed digital evidence of misconduct. “It isn’t helpful to say that these are isolated cases, we now know and we can see that they’re not,” she said. “My view is we have to be very clear that we are going to see more of these cases come to light.” Real tangible progress was being made, she insisted, pointing to Operation Soteria – a pilot study to be rolled out in 14 forces which focuses on a more aggressive pursuit of sexual predators rather than on the credibility of victims – and the recent announcement that VAWG will be given the same importance as counter-terrorism and serious organised crime as a strategic policing requirement. But Blyth stressed that despite a change in narrative and focus, policing alone couldn’t change the way that women and girls are treated, and called for societal change including more education of boys and for more men to speak out against everyday sexism. “I have optimism, I wouldn’t do the job if I didn’t. But we need to really grasp this moment to make those changes, not let anyone off the hook, and not to move on to the next thing. Women’s lives mean more than that,” she said.",News/UK news,Policing attracts men who want to ‘coerce vulnerable people’ says female police chief,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/07/policing-attracts-men-who-want-to-coerce-vulnerable-people-says-female-police-chief

3/8/2022,"The province of Van, in the east of Turkey, is a place of unbelievable beauty, where snow-covered mountains sweep out of the country and into Iran. Turkey is building a six-metre high wall across its border there, and as we reached it, we sank knee-deep into fluffy snow, shivering as the temperature fell to -20C and a bitterly cold wind whipped against our cheeks. In every direction, the view was stunning, mesmerising. But the beauty masks a grim and stomach-turning reality. For many, this landscape is a death trap, part of a terrible and desperate journey that can only be completed by foot. This is a key route for asylum seekers – mostly Afghans – into Turkey and beyond, which is why the wall that snakes along the border is sometimes described as a gateway to Europe. I was there with producer Helen Clifford and cameraman Rob Turner, to make a piece for ITV’s On Assignment programme, and as we lost all feeling in our fingers and then toes within minutes, we asked: why would people attempt this in winter? Because smugglers told them that they were less likely to be caught in such treacherous conditions. The risks people take using this route become clear in spring when the snow melts, uncovering dozens of bodies, including pregnant women and children. Their attempts to flee had failed, leaving just a number carved on a headstone in a nameless graveyard in the city of Van, thousands of miles from Afghanistan. Right now, the story in Ukraine is one of both hell and humanity, with indiscriminate shelling destroying homes, taking lives and forcing millions to flee, and people lining up at borders and train stations with cardboard signs welcoming families into their homes. But even at a time like this, it is important to remember the terrible plight of those fleeing other conflicts. Their stories must not be forgotten. Perhaps the saddest moment in Turkey came as I kneeled on the floor of a play area in a deportation centre, watching a toddler run repeatedly up the green plastic steps of a dinosaur slide and then sliding down. Beside him stood a girl who said she had fled the Taliban because she wanted an education. She and her mother had done that journey, through those same treacherous mountains. She was a child of 10 – around the same age as my oldest son. One man in the same centre told me that those with him died at the border, another described being one of 70 people, packed by smugglers into a vehicle made for 10. “Four people were killed when the car started moving due to lack of oxygen,” he said. And that was not an uncommon story – it was one we heard again and again. Like from Fatima, once a law student and makeup artist in Afghanistan, now hiding in Van after she fled the Taliban who beat her black and blue, twice. After a harrowing journey into Iran, smugglers took thousands of dollars, only to drop her at a crossing into Turkey they knew was impossible. Then they asked for more money to try again. Eventually she scaled the wall and jumped down into a five-metre trench. She and others had to climb on each other’s backs to get out. Then they just ran, to escape the Turkish police. Smugglers took her to the city in a bogus ambulance before holding her in a so-called “shock room”, where refugees are held for weeks or months on end. There they threatened her with rape. We later saw one of those rooms when the Turkish police let us accompany them on a raid into a building with holes in the floor, and shards of ice hanging from the ceiling. Up a flight of stairs, along a corridor covered in a sheet of ice, we discovered 12 men packed into a tiny, freezing room. One man prayed silently in the corner before they were led out into a vehicle that would take them to a deportation centre. Both possibilities – going to the centre or staying with the smugglers – felt hopeless. Britain has set up a resettlement scheme for those who worked for the British government in Afghanistan, but even that seems to be having difficulties. One man has been messaging me repeatedly from another part of Turkey where his temporary asylum period is running out. He has shared letters that he says are death threats from the Taliban, and proof that he worked for G4S, effectively for the British government. But he says he has heard nothing since he applied for Britain’s Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy scheme. In the current crisis, with all eyes on Ukraine, who knows when his circumstances will improve. Turkey’s location means it has been a country into which millions of Syrian refugees have come, with many Afghan refugees now heading in the same direction. Campaigners argue that the hardline response to new refugees is unfair. The governor of Van defended it to me by arguing that his country is full, and saying the migration crisis needs a global response. The issue is not whether we, or any single country, can cope with crisis, it’s how many crises can the world cope with at the same time?

The recent circus of political dishonesty and deceit has rightly evoked condemnation, but the furore has distracted us from the cruel assault this government has made on our poorest citizens. Brown reminds us that access to food, warmth and a reasonable baseline income is the minimum that any government should provide for its citizens. Not only has this government failed to do this, but it has added to people’s despair by increasing taxes, allowing hikes in food and energy prices, cutting universal credit, and taking away much of the safety net of support for those families struggling the most. Politicians never seem to recognise the pain they cause or to hear the voices of those who really suffer from their policies. We should all join Brown in a voluble condemnation of povertygate.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire  In highlighting the extensive evidence of poverty, Gordon Brown should also reflect on Labour’s failure to present a coherent alternative. First, in committing itself to a radical overhaul of a benefits system built on deterrence and punishment, reflected in its failure to ensure the entitlement and dignity of a living wage, and without the subsidy of charitable relief; in how many poor parents blame themselves for not being able to provide the basics of food and warmth for their children and feel shame in seeking help; and in how the system fuels a spectrum of blame heaped on the “feckless poor”. Second, in committing itself to go beyond the relief of poverty, to radically reduce the major inequalities that have such a devastating impact on the health, education and wellbeing of children, families and communities, as evidenced in Sir Michael Marmot’s 2020 review on health equity in England.Prof Mike SteinUniversity of York  Gordon Brown’s article caused me to revisit my letter in 2013. Back then it was charities that reported that half a million people were dependent on food banks (today it is five times that figure), and they did so on the hopeful basis that if the government realised what was happening, it would reverse its welfare cuts. On the contrary, that was all part of David Cameron’s idea of “big society”. Cameron stated that the increase in food banks was proof that big society was working, and his government, with little opposition from Labour, assessed just how much state spending on welfare could be replaced by charitable giving. And so we see more alarm from charities, and former prime ministers, as more responsibilities are delegated to them. This is the Tories’ brave new world – compassionate in giving and conservative in lowering taxes. It is a system that condemns millions to penury.Colin BurkeCartmel, Cumbria  Gordon Brown is undoubtedly right that with so many issues coming along at the same time, some families will fall further and faster into poverty. But simply cancelling the planned national insurance rise without advancing the case for finding the cash that would have been raised is unworthy of him. He should press home the case for taxing the very highest earners more, and a windfall tax on energy companies.Les BrightExeter  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

3/8/2022,"Re your article (More than 1 million girls in the UK lose interest in sport as teenagers, 7 March), it is common for teenagers to have irregular and intense menstrual cycles. No one should be made to feel that they should push past that, or not listen to their bodies at that time. I dropped out of sport as a teenager because I couldn’t be as good as I wanted to be and because (with hindsight) I was emotionally exhausted by school. After only a couple of years, I started being active again on my own terms, without coaching or persuasion, and I have been a non-competitive multisporter for 20 years. Everyone should be allowed to take time out as they grow and figure out their priorities. The focus should be on why people don’t start sport again when they’re ready to. Saying girls “drop out” and are “pushed out” makes it girls’ problem to resist. Let all teenagers learn to listen to themselves, free from judgment. Let them back off in sport, try out other things or simply take time out while they develop. Increase the emphasis on making it usual for people to start or restart sport after the school years are done. And maybe competitive sport should address its attitude to what coaching perceives as critical strength development years in puberty. I suspect that sport’s hang-up about people dropping out when young is more about its fear of the training opportunities that are lost than concern for the welfare of individuals.Emily TaylorEdinburgh  One of the biggest barriers to girls taking part in sport is that so much of it is competitive. If the aim is fitness and good health, then the focus needs to change. Many girls hate getting cold, having to wear revealing or ugly sportswear and not having privacy in changing rooms. Many prefer cooperative rather than competitive activities. So let’s fix that and introduce dancing, yoga, tai chi, long walks, climbing, sailing and group challenges. And let those who want to compete get on with it. I remember on one school journey the girls all succeeding in group challenges while the boys fell out with each other and sulked. “Because”, as one girl said, “they all want to be boss.”Jane LawsonLondon  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

I worked with ministers and senior civil servants to use the system as a force for good – to build relationships with people whose help we needed; to reward innovation, vision, selflessness and hard work; to inspire people working to make energy safer and cleaner and those helping to protect the fuel-poor; and to honour achievements, especially of women, people from ethnic minorities and, ideally, those from outside London.

3/8/2022,"The scenes that shocked Mexico and horrified the world of soccer on Saturday were caught on shaky cell phone videos: men wearing the red and black jerseys of the Liga MX champions, Atlas, lay prone while others in the blue and black of Gallos del Querétaro beat and stripped them. Hundreds of raging fans descended on the pitch in Querétaro’s Corregidora Stadium, chasing their rivals, who sought refuge in the Atlas players’ locker room. Many Atlas fans ripped off their shirts to avoid being attacked. The riot that broke out during the match between the two teams from central Mexico left 26 injured, three in a critical condition, the governor of the state of Querétaro, Mauricio Kuri, told reporters at a press conference on Sunday. Kuri also denied reports that there had been fatalities. While there have been incidents of violence in and around Mexican stadiums in the past, most are linked to the country’s general insecurity than the unruliness of fans. For example in 2011, during a game between Santos Laguna and Monarcas de Morelia, a gun battle started just outside the stadium. Players ran into the locker rooms and fans dove for cover as shots rang out in the parking lot. There have been fights between fans of some of the country’s most popular teams but nothing comparable to the levels seen on Saturday. Stadiums are typically places where families gather safely to enjoy games together. So the question arises: what went wrong between these two teams? Some argue that Saturday’s riot was predictable. While the bad blood between the teams’ fans was not well known on a national level until this weekend – Querétaro have been a yo-yo team for a long time, while Atlas had an unspectacular record until they won their first title in 70 years in 2021 – the rivalry spans more than a decade, with at least two instances in recent years where fights resulted in injuries. According to Mexican writer Pablo Duarte, who grew up in Querétaro and is a lifelong fan of Gallos (Spanish for “roosters”), the rivalry started in 2007. On the last day of that season, Atlas beat Querétaro condemning them to relegation. Then, in 2010, 30 people were injured in a brawl between the teams’ most prominent fan groups, Querétaro’s Resistencia Albiazul and Atlas’ Barra 51. “I would say that was a turning point,” Duarte says in a phone interview from Mexico City, “because it marked a disconnect between the quality of [Gallos], a team with a paltry track record – one-time cup winner and once a finalist for the Mexican championship in 2015 – and the constant violence of the fans.” Querétaro fans also fought with fans of Atlas and San Luis at two separate games in 2013. Indeed, it seemed the only thing that overtook news about Querétaro’s brutal fights was the surprise acquisition of Brazilian star Ronaldinho in 2014. He stayed for a year, taking the team to the league’s final. As the fierce reputation of Querétaro’s supporters grew, Atlas’ ardent fans were never far behind, says Sergio Varela, a professor of sociology at Mexico’s National Autonomous University, who has studied violence in Mexican soccer. Throughout Atlas’ decades in the wilderness, the fans endured. Despite the defeats they continued to sing, cheer and travel with the team across the country. “Some cultural researchers argue that in Latin America, life is lived in a very melodramatic way and part of that melodrama is exaggerated feelings of sadness and defeat,” Varela says. “That could help explain why fans of losing teams seek to emphasize this idea of tenacity by signaling that even through the worst of the worst, they will always be there.” Given the teams’ rivalry, many experts were surprised at the lack of adequate security in the stadium on Saturday. In one video, a security guard is seen opening a gate to let a stream of angry Querétaro fans through to chase down Atlas fans on the other side. Exact details of security at Saturday’s game have yet to emerge but it appears staffing was lagging behind other fixtures in Liga MX. Adolfo Rios, the Gallos general manager, said his team was following the stadium’s rules, which require one security guard for every 25 people. With more than 14,000 fans in the stands on Saturday he said there were around 600 security personnel present, including private guards and state and municipal police. In contrast, Estadio Azteca’s website says a typical derby between Mexico City rivals Pumas and América would have one member of security for every 14 fans. “The rules are clear in defining the number of personnel required for a game, according to the characteristics of each game,” Gallos president Gabriel Solares said on Sunday. The issue, he added, “wasn’t the number of personnel, but their positions and how they structured their operation.” Duarte is dismissive of the amount of security at the game. “It is unbelievable that there was so little security in the stadium when it is well known that this was a rivalry with a lot of bad blood,” he says. The question now is whether Mexican soccer can recover its image ahead of the 2026 World Cup, which the country is set to co-host with the United States and Canada. The Mexican Soccer Federation will meet on Tuesday to announce what measures it will take to prevent future violence and has not ruled out the possibility of expelling Querétaro from this season. On Sunday, the federation announced Corregidora Stadium would remain closed and implemented a temporary league-wide rule that organized fan groups will only be allowed to attend their teams’ home games. The origin of such a distressing outpouring of brutality will most likely be studied for years to come, says Varela, and involves more complex social dynamics like economic inequality, lack of education and pervasive “machismo” in Mexico. But one thing is clear, according to Duarte. As both teams struggle with losing records, the violence gave their fans visibility, as if to say: “We fight, therefore we exist.”",Sport/Football,"‘We fight, therefore we exist’: what lay behind Mexico’s brutal football riot?",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/07/mexico-football-riot-liga-mx-queretaro-v-atlas-soccer
3/8/2022,"Earlier today I set you the following puzzles about dividing up food, inspired by the Lwów school of mathematics, a group of mathematicians who lived in the city that is now Lviv in the 1930s. 1) Three friends each contribute £4 to buy a £12 ham. The first friend divides it into three parts, asserting the weights are equal. The second friend, distrustful of the first, reweighs the pieces and judges them to be worth £3, £4 and £5. The third, distrustful of them both, weighs the ham on their own scales, getting another result. If each friend insists that their weighings are correct, how can they share the pieces (without cutting them anew) in such a way that each of them would have to admit they got at least £4 of ham? Solution The third friend must believe that at least one of the pieces is worth at least £4, since if they didn’t, the total of all the pieces wouldn’t add up to £12. They take this piece. There are now two pieces left. One of these pieces must be a piece that the second friend thinks is worth £4 or £5, and so the second friend takes this one. The first friend takes the remaining piece, which they think is worth £4. 2) Ten plain and 14 seeded rolls are randomly arranged in a circle, equidistantly spaced, as below. Show that using a straight line it is always possible to divide the circle into two halves such that there are an equal number of plain and seeded rolls on either side of the line. Solution The 24 rolls are in a circle. Draw an arbitrary line that cuts the circle in half, as below, dividing the rolls into two sides of 12. If one side has five plain rolls, then we’re done. Let’s say the left side has more than five plain rolls. (The right side, therefore, has less than five plain rolls). Rotate the cut anticlockwise by 1/24 of a full rotation, as shown by the dotted line below, so that the left half loses its roll at the top and gains a roll at the bottom. If the lost and gained roll are the same type, then this half has the same number of plain rolls in total as it did before. If the top one is plain and the other seeded (or vice versa) then the total number of plain rolls reduces by 1 (or increases by 1). If we keep on rotating the line, each time losing and gaining a roll, then after 180 degrees, the section that was ‘left half’ will now be the ‘right half’, which we know has less than five plain rolls. In other words, the section started with more than 5 plain rolls, and then in a process of either adding or losing a single roll, ended up with less than 5 plain rolls. There must have been a step on the way that there were exactly five plain rolls. For readers wanting to know what this has got to the ham sandwich theorem (which I discussed in the earlier post), both of them involve applications of the intermediate value theorem, which states that if a value is moving continuously from A to B, it will pass every value from A to B.

3/8/2022,"The film musical Mary Poppins was instantly recognised as a visual masterpiece on its release in 1964, when it won Julie Andrews an Oscar for her performance as the Banks’s children’s nanny and gave Walt Disney his biggest box-office success to date. Andrews’s then husband, Tony Walton, who has died aged 87 after suffering a stroke, was responsible for the set and costume design that brought a magical look to a screen fantasy combining live action with animation. He was thrilled that the Sherman brothers, Richard and Robert, who wrote the songs, suggested switching the story to late-Edwardian 1910 from the 1930s setting of PL Travers’s original book and its sequels, because Disney had acquired rights to the story but not the illustrations. “I love the turn-of-the-century look,” he said in a 2011 interview. “I loved to design for it, so that was a godsend for me.” Particularly memorable was Cherry Tree Lane, the London street where the Banks family live at No 17. In his teens, Walton had disliked the perfect, flat cobblestone streets he saw in the film musical An American in Paris, starring Gene Kelly. Looking for more realism, he came up with a curved street with a slight incline. Designing the costumes was similarly satisfying for Walton. He went for a mix of “sombre seriousness and playfulness” for Andrews’s garments, in grey, black and slate colours – but hinting at the nanny’s secret life by creating linings that gave flashes of crimson and other bright colours. Daisies and cherries were featured on her black hat. For Mary Poppins’s cockney friend and jack-of-all-trades, Bert, played by Dick Van Dyke (who also acted the ageing bank director, Mr Dawes Sr), Walton came up with a “jolly holiday” design of tangerine, cherry, and raspberry stripes, created by sewing different widths of ribbon on to a white jacket. Meanwhile, Glynis Johns sought to influence her own costume by telling Walton: “Now, Tony, I know I am playing a suffragette, but we are going to make me pretty, aren’t we?” Walt Disney himself worked closely with Walton on Mary Poppins. “Frequently, he was the one who came up with inventive ideas,” said the designer, who insisted that he never sought to imprint his own trademark on any production. “I begin each project as though I’ve never done one before,” he explained. Mary Poppins earned him the first of five Oscar nominations, this and two others – Murder on the Orient Express (1974) and The Wiz (1978) – for costume design. For best art direction, he gained another nomination on The Wiz, and finally won an Academy Award as a member of the design team on All That Jazz (1979), the director Bob Fosse’s autobiographical story starring Roy Scheider. Walton was responsible for the fantasy sequences, which were likened to the director Federico Fellini’s dazzlingly visual 1963 masterpiece 8½. One reviewer remarked that Walton’s sets contributed to the “overwhelming of the eye”. On a rare excursion into television, he won an Emmy for a 1985 screen version of Death of a Salesman. The challenge was to create a set that could instantly transform into different rooms, from an Italian restaurant to a Boston hotel bedroom, to reflect everything happening in the mind of Willy Loman, the self-deluded protagonist in Arthur Miller’s play. Meanwhile, Walton’s long career in theatre garnered 16 Tony nominations, with wins for Pippin (1973), House of Blue Leaves (1986) and a Broadway revival of Guys and Dolls (1992), distinguished by its garish, fantasy-cartoon New York sets – including, wrote one reviewer, “a sewer as epic as the whale’s belly in Pinocchio”. Anthony was born in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, to Hilda (nee Drew) and Lancelot Walton, a surgeon. He was kicked out of his classics class at Radley college, Oxfordshire, at the age of 14 after reading a poem in a Liverpudlian accent, and moved to the City of Oxford School of Technology, Art and Commerce. Although he was expected to follow his father into medicine, his hobbies pushed him towards the stage. He enjoyed making and dressing marionettes and, aged 16, led a group of theatre students putting on puppet shows featuring music hall and the operas of Mozart and Gilbert and Sullivan. Some were performed in the gardens of Christ Church, Oxford, and he created the sets and operated the lighting. When the painter and stage designer John Piper saw one, he told Walton that he should follow a career in production design. By then, he had already met Andrews, a child star whom he saw on the London stage and discovered she lived with her mother in his own town, Walton-on-Thames. More than 10 years later, in 1959, they married. Divorce followed after nine years, but they remained friends and he later designed the sets and costumes for a 2003 New York revival of The Boy Friend directed by Andrews, almost 50 years after she began her Broadway career in the starring role. Following his studies at the Slade School of Fine Art, when he also acted at Wimbledon theatre, and national service with the RAF as a trainee pilot in Canada, Andrews invited him to Broadway, where she was starring in My Fair Lady (1956) and Walton was mesmerised by that and other shows. His early career included designing sets and costumes for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, both on Broadway (1962) and in the West End (1963). For the 1966 film version, he gave a more realistic look to the back streets of ancient Rome compared with what one critic described as the stage show’s “cardboard, vaudevillian unreal quality with colourful baggy pants and houses spilling down a hillside basking in bright sunlight”. In 1975, he was set designer on the original Broadway production of Chicago. Later, he directed New York stage productions. In 1991, Walton married the writer Gen LeRoy. She survives him, along with Emma, the daughter of his marriage to Andrews, and Bridget, his stepdaughter.

3/8/2022,"The UK tax authority has withdrawn petitions to close down four Liberty Steel companies, giving breathing space to the GFG Alliance metals empire presided over by Sanjeev Gupta. Gupta’s group of metals companies, including steel, aluminium and energy plants, has been struggling for finance for a year since the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital. The companies are said to employ as many as 35,000 people around the world. The UK winding-up petitions, revealed last month, threatened the jobs of 3,000 workers across five plants, mostly in the north of England, including relatively large mills that make speciality steel in Rotherham and Stocksbridge in South Yorkshire. That threat appears to have receded with the HMRC deal, although GFG also announced that workers at Liberty Pressing Solutions in Coventry had been invited into consultations about a possible closure of the plant. The factory had 580 employees, according to its latest accounts, for 2019, but it is thought that there are now only about 200 workers who could be made redundant. As well as the financial problems, GFG has a threat of criminal investigations from the UK’s Serious Fraud Office and French prosecutors hanging over it. GFG said it had made a “further significant injection of shareholder capital” into Liberty Steel UK, but did not specify how much or which companies within the loose group of companies had been the recipients. In a statement on Monday, GFG said: “Following positive discussions with HM Revenue and Customs, winding-up petitions have been withdrawn. In parallel, constructive discussions continue with existing creditors to repay liabilities and with new lenders over longer-term refinancing of the business.” In a written statement, Gupta said: “With refinancing initiatives well under way and our businesses performing well, this will be a formative year for our organisation as we work through our transformation plan. “As our restructuring and refinancing programmes continue to progress positively, we are also making operational improvements to further enhance the performance of our core businesses against a backdrop of robust demand for our products.” Alun Davies, a national officer for Community, a steelworkers’ union, said the HMRC deal was “extremely welcome”. “This is the best route to protect jobs, and the deal will increase confidence that GFG is committed to Liberty Steel UK,” he said. “GFG must now make good on promises to refinance Liberty Steel and deliver the investments we need to secure a long-term sustainable future.” Davies added that he wanted the UK government to step in to support the steel industry by providing subsidies on energy prices, which have risen enormously as the recovery from Covid-19 lockdowns pushes up demand and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens gas and oil supplies.",News/Business,HMRC deal saves thousands of Liberty Steel jobs at four UK plants,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/07/hmrc-deal-saves-thousands-of-liberty-steel-jobs-at-four-uk-plants
3/8/2022,"Open source analysts and military experts first spotted the mysterious Z-shaped letter hand-painted on Russian tanks and military trucks massed on the Ukrainian border on 19 February, leading to widespread speculation among western experts as to what the letter meant. As Russia’s invasion began, more military hardware was spotted emblazoned with Zs, as well as other letters, including O, X, A and V. The letters seen on the hardware were usually framed by squares, triangles, and other painted shapes. The letter Z does not exist in the Cyrillic Russian alphabet. The most popular theory used by military experts to explain the letters is that they were written according to the respective areas where the Russian troops are usually stationed, with Z potentially standing for Zapad (west). Others believe the letters were drawn in an attempt to avoid friendly fire, while some pro-Kremlin Russian military experts have speculated that the letter Z stands for the name of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and the letter V for Vladimir Putin. The Russian defense ministry itself has not commented on any of the theories, and instead posted on its Instagram channel that Z meant Za pobedu (“for victory”) and V stood for “power of truth”. In the past two weeks, Z has gone from a military marking to the main symbol of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Just three days after the invasion, the Kremlin-funded state network RT announced on its social media channels that it was selling Z merchandise, including T-shirts and hoodies, to show support for Russian troops. Since then, countless flashmobs across the country have been organised by the authorities, in which young Russians are seen wearing a Z shirt while displaying their support for the war. The Z letter has also been painted on large Soviet-era apartment blocks and posted on street advertisement signs. A number of schools have also posted images of children standing in a Z formation. One image that has been circulating online since Sunday showed terminally ill children from a hospice in the southern city of Kazan forming a Z to support the invasion of Ukraine. Officials eager to show their support for the war have even pledged to include the letter in the names of their region. Sergei Tsivilev, head of the Kemerovo region, announced that he had decided to rename the region and add the letter Z to the region, which might now be listed as KuZbass. The symbol has also had some limited exposure outside Russia. On Friday, thousands of Serbs waving Russian flags and carrying Z letters marched through Belgrade to the Russian embassy in a show of public support for Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine. And on Saturday, the Russian gymnast Ivan Kuliak sported the Z insignia as he stood next to Ukraine’s Kovtun Illia, the gold medallist at a gymnastics World Cup event in Doha. Walking around Moscow, one occasionally spots cars with a Z painted on them, but the sign is yet to see genuine widespread use among the Russian population. Russia has a history of promoting certain signs and symbols to gather support for its military. During the country’s annexation of Crimea, Russia heavily promoted the use of the orange- and black-striped ribbons of Saint George. The ribbon now enjoys wide popularity in Russia as a way to show public support for the Russian government and the military. Some Russians, however, have ridiculed Z. During Sunday’s countrywide rallies against Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, some protesters were seen holding signs with the word Zachem (For what?). Russians have also taken to the internet to post various memes satirising Z. In one, Harry Potter is seen showing Ron his lightning-shaped scar, which has been modified to show the letter Z. More ominously, Z has been used as an intimidation tactic against those who oppose the war. Members of the opposition art collective Pussy Riot, as well as the anti-war NGO Memorial, have said the Z symbol was painted on the door of their flat.",News/World news,Why has the letter Z become the symbol of war for Russia?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/why-has-the-letter-z-become-the-symbol-of-war-for-russia
3/8/2022,"John Oliver explored how difficult it is to appeal a wrongful conviction in the US, even if there’s compelling evidence of innocence, on Last Week Tonight. Though the constitution contains the writ of habeas corpus to protect against unlawful imprisonment – “basically, you have a right to challenge your incarceration, and you can do that in state and federal court,” Oliver explained – there’s a major limitation: in general, innocence itself is not an appealable issue. You can only appeal based on evidence that wasn’t available during your original trial or a claim that your constitutional rights were violated during it. “But that’s already a long shot,” Oliver said. “When the whole criminal justice system is geared toward getting a conviction, it has very little interest in seeing its work undone.” For example, one of the few ways to get a post-conviction appeal is to establish new evidence, but you still have to prove that the new evidence would have changed the outcome of the original trial. “And prosecutors will fight that notion hard,” Oliver said, pointing to an example from the so-called West Memphis Three, who were wrongfully convicted of murdering children in the early 90s and who tried to get a new trial based on DNA evidence in 2010. An assistant attorney general argued against the appeal in the state supreme court, saying the introduction of DNA evidence threatened “the criminal justice system’s interest in finality”. “Hold on – the harm is to the finality?” Oliver fumed. “But if the final decision could be wrong, you should want to make sure that you get it right. There’s a reason that La La Land didn’t just keep the Oscar after Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty skin-smiled their way through that mistake.” Moreover, most judges defer to prosecutors’ arguments “without even changing the heading”, Oliver said; one study in the largest county in Texas found that judges adopted the prosecutors’ findings verbatim in 96% of their rulings. “And if at this point it seems like a whole system is set up to preserve its process even at the cost of human life,” he added, then take the case of Joseph Amrine, wrongfully convicted in 1986 for the stabbing death of another inmate. During his 2003 appeal, the Missouri supreme court justice Laura Denvir Stith said: “You’re suggesting if we don’t find there’s a constitutional violation, that even if we find that Mr Amrine is actually innocent, he should be executed?” To which assistant attorney general Frank Jung replied: “That’s correct, your honor.” “Holy shit,” Oliver exclaimed. “You know you’re on the wrong side of an argument when you’re asked, ‘Should innocent people be executed?’ and you say, ‘That’s correct, your honor.’ That’s the kind of question that only has one right answer, like ‘is the queen dead?’ The obvious answer to that being ‘yes, absolutely, she’s been dead since 2007, and it’s a good thing.’” Federal courts can step in to offer relief, but only if state courts are so out of line that “no fair-minded judge would agree” to the ruling, which is “an incredibly high bar to clear”, said Oliver. “Reasonable people disagree all the time on issues like which way the toilet paper roll should go or how a tortoise should wear clothes. Is it over the shell or under the shell? There’s a vibrant discussion to be had here! There will be dissenting voices.” This is because federal courts are hamstrung by AEDPA, or the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, a 1997 law passed in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombings that was intended to keep death-row terrorists like Timothy McVeigh from endlessly appealing their convictions. Besides the high bar of reasonable dissent, the law also imposed a strict one-year deadline to file a federal appeal once the conviction is finalized. “Which I know might sound like a lot of time to you, but it really isn’t,” Oliver explained. “A federal appeal is a massive undertaking, often involving doing new research, speaking to experts, witnesses, previous attorneys and investigators. One year can not be enough.” Post-AEDPA, the deadline has been missed 80 times in death row cases. “Eighty times death row prisoners went to the trouble of filing an appeal,” said Oliver, “only to be told, ‘Sorry, too late! It doesn’t count.’ “All of that brings us to today, where many wrongfully convicted people are still locked up with a racially disproportionate impact,” he continued. According to a 2017 report by the national registry of exonerations, innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted than innocent white people. So “with a system so fundamentally fucked, what do we do?” Oliver posed, before arguing for the repeal of AEDPA, which “we should do that as soon as possible. “In addition, we should continue to address all of the many factors that lead to wrongful convictions in the first place,” he added, “and when they do happen, we need to make sure that we’ve elected prosecutors who will undertake conviction integrity reviews and governors who will use their pardon power to undo the state’s mistakes.” It needs to be a priority, he argued, “because right now we have a system where people can be wrongly convicted, with bad defense attorneys, and left to fight in a convoluted appeals system with little to no help. “At which point it really feels like our system is essentially guilty until proven rich or lucky,” he concluded. “And that has to change, because we cannot keep letting the most vulnerable be casualties of a system that cares more about quick and final decisions than actually correct ones.”",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver on wrongful convictions: ‘Guilty until proven rich or lucky’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/07/john-oliver-last-week-tonight-recap-wrongful-convictions
3/8/2022,"Ed Sheeran has denied “borrowing” ideas from unknown songwriters without credit. The musician, 31, is in the high court facing accusations of copying parts of his 2017 hit Shape of You from Oh Why, a 2015 song written by Sami Chokri and Ross O’Donoghue and performed by Chokri under the alias Sami Switch. Andrew Sutcliffe QC, barrister for the pair, claimed that Sheeran treated lesser-known songwriters differently from his famous peers such as Rihanna, Jay-Z and Coldplay, and alleged that the songwriting process for Shape of You involved collecting ideas rather than spontaneous composition. Sheeran denied both suggestions. “I have always tried to be completely fair in crediting anyone who makes any contribution to any song I write,” he told the court. “I do refer to other works on occasion when I write, as do many songwriters. If there is a reference to another work, I notify my team so that steps can be taken to obtain clearance. “I have been as scrupulous as I possibly can and have even given credits to people who I believe may have been no more than a mere influence for a songwriting element. This is because I want to treat other songwriters fairly.” Sheeran has already given the writers behind TLC’s 90s hit No Scrubs a credit on Shape of You after comparisons were made between the two songs. Sheeran has previously said he wrote Shape of You in 90 minutes. This was not unusual for him, he told the court. “There is no pre-mediated thought process, I simply make things up as I go along - and if it sounds good, I keep it. “I think of them as sort of ‘excitement bottles’ - if a song is working, the excitement pushes it to the point where it’s finished; if it’s not, then I’ll leave it and move on to something else.” In May 2018, Sheeran and his cowriters John McDaid (of Snow Patrol), Kandi Burruss, Kevin Briggs, Steven McCutcheon and Tameka Cottle asked the high court to declare that they had not infringed Chokri and O’Donoghue’s copyright. The pair issued a counter claim for copyright infringement, claiming that Shape of You infringes “particular lines and phrases” of their song. Sheeran, McCutcheon (known as Steve Mac) and McDaid have been barred by music licensing body PRS for Music from collecting an estimated £20m in royalties from the performances or broadcasts of Shape of You. Sheeran’s lawyers previously told the high court that the singer and his co-writers have no recollection of having heard the song Oh Why before the legal battle and “vehemently deny” the allegations of copying. On Friday, Sutcliffe claimed that Sheeran “borrows ideas and throws them into his songs, sometimes he will acknowledge it but sometimes he won’t”. Sheeran denied this, saying that “if Mr Sutcliffe would have done his research”, he would have found he had cleared parts of songs with “lots” of unknown composers, including a song that sampled an “unknown composer” from the score to Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Sheeran denied Sutcliffe’s allegations that he must have been aware of Chokri because they appeared on the YouTube channel SBTV around the same time, they allegedly had mutual friends, Chokri said he tweeted at Sheeran asking him to listen to his music, and Sheeran allegedly shouted Chokri’s name at a performance. Sheeran said he received “hundreds of thousands of tweets every single day” and stated that he doesn’t do on-stage shoutouts. Sheeran admitted to settling a previous copyright case about his song Photograph on the advice of his lawyers because it was a “nuisance” and “more trouble than it was worth”. Songwriters Thomas Leonard and Martin Harrington sued Sheeran for $20m for copyright infringement, alleging similarities between Sheeran’s hit and their song Amazing, performed by X Factor winner Matt Cardle. Sheeran paid the pair $5m and gave them 35% of his gross publishing revenue – shares they have since returned. He told the high court today that the similarities were a coincidence and that he did not copy the song. He said it was the first time he had faced such a claim and that he felt “bruised” by the experience. “Even though I felt that I had done nothing wrong, we decided to settle the case because of the money and time it would take to fight it. However, that left me with a very bad feeling afterwards. The decision to settle felt morally weird given that we were innocent of the allegations made. It made me feel like I did not want to play the song any more.” The case continues. Sheeran is expected to resume giving evidence tomorrow (8 March).",Arts/Music,Ed Sheeran denies ‘borrowing’ ideas from unknown songwriters without credit,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/07/ed-sheeran-denies-borrowing-ideas-from-unknown-songwriters-without-credit
3/8/2022,"How blessed are the peacemakers? After the first wave of intermediaries led by Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz, a new group have beaten their way to Vladimir Putin’s long table since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or at least sought to intervene by phone. The current crop includes Israeli prime minister Naftali Bennett, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, president of Turkey, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohamed bin Zayed of the UAE and now the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. These countries have all defended their interventions and various shades of neutrality over the war, saying it puts them in a good place to act as honest brokers. Their critics, by contrast, say the peacemaking is a fig leaf behind which to hide moral bankruptcy and to justify the maintenance of deep commercial ties with Russia, still a potential victor from this trial of strength. Bennett’s visit to Moscow on Saturday was the most surprising and consequential. He apparently consulted Macron, Scholz and US president Joe Biden in advance of breaking Shabbat to spend three hours with Putin before travelling on to Berlin to brief Scholz. Erdoğan was also given warning, since he needed to use Turkish airspace. Since the visit, Bennett has spoken to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, twice, and is due to speak to Putin again. His foreign minister Yair Lapid will fly to meet US secretary of state Antony Blinken in Lithuania, suggesting he may be making some progress. Bennett, prime minister since June, is a diplomatic novice, but he was accompanied by Zeev Elkin, a veteran of former PM Benjamin Netanyahu’s meetings with Putin from 2009 onwards and, according to Israeli accounts, is the official who has spent the longest time with the Russian leader. But Bennett’s visit has come under domestic attack from those angry that Israel has in effect decided to stay neutral by blocking arms supplies to Ukraine. Zelenskiy himself complained initially: “I don’t feel Bennett is wrapped in our flag.” His early stance also displeased Washington, but the anger was tempered when Bennett was persuaded to support the UN general assembly resolution on 2 March condemning Russia. Israel has motives to stay onside with Russia. If Moscow can be persuaded not to sign off on a revival of the Iran nuclear deal, currently close to completion in Vienna, that would be a diplomatic triumph for a country that has long opposed it. Israel also needs Russia to maintain a deal inside Syria that allows it to mount attacks on Iranian positions. In a furious piece for Israel’s Haaretz newspaper, the author Uri Misgav complained: “We’re walking on eggshells, wary of offending Vladimir Putin’s inflated honour […] Bennett was even pulled out of a meeting to take an extended phone call from him. The excuse was that it involved Israeli ‘mediation efforts’. Instead of hanging up on a psychopathic, ruthless dictator, Israel is acting like a Russian client state, nearly an ally.” The former director general of the Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs, Alon Liel, was equally scathing. “Can it be that the defence ministry can say that because we need to bomb Syria once or twice a week, we’re going to stay neutral in this war?” he asked. “Bennett’s trip to Russia gave Putin the stamp of neutral Israel’s approval – which we won’t be able to shake.” Bennett denies that his efforts should be seen in such a light, saying he has a moral responsibility to try to bring peace. “I went to Moscow and Berlin to try to help bring a dialogue between all the sides, with the blessing and encouragement of all the players,” he said. “Even if the chances are not great.” Turkey has also been accused of shopping on both sides of the street. The country is battling a financial crisis and has not imposed sanctions or closed Turkish airspace to Russia, even though it has condemned the invasion unambiguously, allowed Turkish-built drones to be bought by the Ukrainian army and closed the Bosporus and Dardanelles under the 1936 Montreux Pact, allowing it, if necessary, to prevent some Russian warships from crossing the Turkish straits. (In practice, Russia has the ships that it needs in the Black Sea to mount an amphibious invasion.) Criticism inside Turkey of Erdoğan has been less intense than of Bennett, but it is noticeable that Boris Johnson spoke to Erdoğan by phone on Friday and Wendy Sherman, the US deputy secretary of state, met Turkish officials that day. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and his Ukrainian opposite number Dmytro Kuleba have agreed to meet at a forum in southern Turkey on Thursday, the first potential talks between the top diplomats since Russia launched its invasion. Putin and Erdoğan, both in their late 60s and in power for decades, like each other’s blunt style. The Russian president once said of his Turkish counterpart: “This is a person who keeps his word – a man.” Erdoğan spoke to Putin on Sunday for an hour, calling for a ceasefire or humanitarian corridors of the kind the two men have negotiated in Syria. Either way, his call achieved little. But Erdoğan has previously taken a bet on Russia. It chose to purchase Russian S-400 air defence systems, prompting US sanctions and Nato criticism. Its tourism sector relies heavily on 5 million Russian visitors annually, and Russia is overseeing Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear plant in Mersin province. Gazprom owns Turkstream, the gas pipeline from Russia that meets 40% of Turkish demand. For Turkey’s right wing, what is at stake is not Europe’s future, but Turkey’s as an ascending power. But Turkey is also a Nato member, looking for a way back with the US, and is Ukraine’s fifth biggest trading partner. Perennially balancing east and west, Turkey is probably not the honest broker that Putin wants. A third mediator has been the United Arab Emirates, close to Moscow and always happy to put out the welcome mat for the Russian elite. The UAE abstained in a UN security council vote on Russia’s invasion, with the country’s senior diplomat, Anwar Gargash, saying in a Twitter post that the Gulf state “believes that taking sides would only lead to more violence”. He asserted: “On the Ukrainian crisis, our priorities are to encourage all parties to adopt diplomacy and negotiate to find a political settlement that will end this crisis.” When the vote returned to the general assembly a few days later, however, the UAE did vote against Russia. Bin Zayed, Abu Dhabi’s crown prince, spoke to Putin, saying the country would “continue its coordinations with the concerned parties in order to help find a sustainable political solution to the ongoing crisis”. The UAE does not want to damage its ties to Russia. They work together in Libya and elsewhere in Africa. Trade between the two countries has grown tenfold since 1997 to $5bn (£3.8bn) in 2021. The UAE accounts for 55% of the total trade between Russia and the Gulf region, and is the largest Arab investor in Russia, accounting for 80% of the total. The fourth and latest mediator is Modi. He spoke to Putin on Monday and urged the Russian leader to hold direct talks with Zelenskiy. An advocate of multi-alignment, India has also faced some obloquy for abstaining both at the UN security council and the general assembly on 2 March. India’s first duty was to evacuate more than 16,000 Indian students trapped in Ukraine. But it feels constrained. Close to 60% of India’s military hardware comes from Russia, and most of its civilian nuclear technology, but it hoped it could persuade Russia to lean away from China. That now looks less likely. India’s refusal to condemn also shows the limits of the Quad, the four-way nascent partnership between Japan, India, the US and Australia supposed to act as a point of light to countries in the region opposed to China.",News/World news,"The world leaders pushing for peace in Ukraine, and their motives",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/07/the-world-leaders-pushing-for-peace-in-ukraine-and-their-motives
3/8/2022,"The mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong have expressed unease at the Morrison government naming their cities as a potential base for nuclear-powered submarines, with one describing the Aukus plans as a “fantasy”. Questions have also been raised about the government’s process for shortlisting Newcastle, Port Kembla in Wollongong and Brisbane for a new east coast base, given that a previous Defence review had not backed them as most-preferred sites. The South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick, a former submariner, said Scott Morrison’s announcement on Monday was “thick with political fog” with an election looming, noting the final site would not be selected until 2023. Patrick said: “Why pork barrel in one electorate when you can – for the same price – pork barrel in three?” Morrison said the government had “provisioned more than $10bn to meet the facilities and infrastructure requirements” for the transition from Australia’s existing Collins-class submarines to the nuclear-powered submarines to be acquired under the Aukus pact with the UK and the US. He said Defence had looked at 19 potential sites and narrowed them down to the three preferred locations. Defence would now discuss the plans further with state and local governments and “begin negotiations on what will be an enormous undertaking”. The moves come amid continuing uncertainty about when the first of the nuclear-powered submarines will be operating. Morrison originally estimated it would be by about 2040 but the government now insists it may be sooner. The new base – which the Coalition wants to build in either Brisbane, Newcastle or Port Kembla – would “enable the regular visiting of US and UK nuclear-powered submarines”, Morrison said in a virtual address to the Lowy Institute. However, the mayors of Newcastle and Wollongong both said they were not consulted about the decision. With both cities historically home to anti-war movements they expected considerable community opposition. Both cities have passed official resolutions to make them nuclear-free zones. There is also believed to be opposition to nuclear power, particularly where it is used to propel a weapon of war – although spent fuel rods from the Lucas Heights reactor have passed through Port Kembla on their way for processing in France. Wollongong’s lord mayor, Gordon Bradbery, an independent, said he was waiting for more detail about the proposal before he would consult the local community. “It’s not only nuclear power and nuclear-powered submarines, but it’s the location of a strategic defence asset and that would make anyone who gets this particular facility a target,” Bradbery said. “International tensions now are playing on a lot of people’s minds and there would be concerns about our city as a location for nuclear-powered submarines.” Bradbery said Wollongong city council had previously worked with Regional Development Australia to make a submission to the federal government to relocate naval activities from Garden Island in Sydney Harbour to Port Kembla, but this was for conventional submarines only. “It just disappeared into the ether at the time,” Bradbery said. “Many suggested it was pie in the sky as the navy wasn’t keen on relocating from Garden Island.” Newcastle’s Labor lord mayor, Nuatali Nelmes, said the city had no intention of giving up its nuclear-free status over a “fantasy”. “The whole deal is a fantasy,” Nelmes said. “This announcement, the Aukus decision and the absolutely hopeless way they have handled this submarine contract – we are not getting lumped with their mess. “It is also typical of the federal government to have unilateral decision making where cities like Newcastle, which have been for many decades, a nuclear-free zone, would even be considered.” But the Liberal premier of New South Wales, Dominic Perrottet, welcomed the inclusion of Port Kembla and Newcastle on the federal government’s shortlist, saying the world faced “very uncertain times”. “Defence protection for our country is paramount and we have worked very closely with the federal government to identify these sites for our state,” Perrottet told the Nine Network. A spokesperson for the Queensland Labor government said it was “yet to receive any detailed information from the commonwealth”. A 2011 Defence report ranked potential options for a new east coast home port for submarines. The top three options were in Sydney Harbour, followed by two options in Jervis Bay, south of Sydney. “Newcastle has its strengths, but the slight edge that it has with respect to positive people factors is compromised by its isolation from any other naval infrastructure, its susceptibility to flooding, and its sometimes difficult harbour entrance,” the future submarine basing study said. Newcastle Port was sixth on the list and the Port of Brisbane was eighth. The report included the caveat that detailed costing and environmental impact analysis “may generate a different outcome”. It placed a priority on the proximity to fleet assets in Sydney. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The same 2011 Defence study said it “would be impractical” to develop a future submarine basing capability at Port Kembla, noting it was previously found to be “a small and congested harbour with little space for substantial expansion”. Patrick, a senator who obtained the 2011 report under freedom of information laws, said it had been “a pure study” completed “without political considerations”. Although that study was focused on a new base for conventionally powered submarines, Patrick said he believed the presence of the Lucas Heights reactor in Sydney and associated specialists would only strengthen the case for Sydney. Patrick accused Morrison of dangling a “carrot” for three electorates prior to the election due in May. “In some sense, it’s a toxic carrot because it will divide communities, but he’s particularly good at that,” Patrick said. In a statement, Morrison said an east coast submarine base “would enhance Australia’s strategic deterrent capability in the Pacific Ocean”. The locations were “selected on submarine basing criteria, which included access to exercise operating areas, proximity to industrial infrastructure, and significant population centres to support personnel and recruitment”. Labor demanded a “proper briefing” on the base plans. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, who has supported the Aukus partnership, said the government had made “an announcement about there being an announcement down the track”. “You can’t actually defend the country with a media release,” Albanese said.

3/8/2022,"Any mention of elastic reminds me of being a child. The snap of a rubber band sling-shot across a classroom. Playing dress-ups in tutus with white elastic running inside the waistband. The wide strap across a pair of jiffies. As an adult, I only ever notice elastic when it has stopped working and the slack material left behind is starting to annoy me. Most elastics are made of natural or synthetic rubber that have been mixed with other fibres. Imagine a very, very thin rubber band that has been woven with cotton or polyester yarn. The key feature of elastic is its ability to stretch and retract to its original size and shape repeatedly. When elastic is damaged or aged this ability lessens. There are steps that can be taken to prolong the life and stretch of elastic, but sometimes it will need to be replaced. This week we got some expert advice on both prevention and the cure. Carolina Quintero Rodriguez, a fashion lecturer at RMIT University says, “when elastic fabrics are elongated beyond their stretchability or over an extended period of time, the fibres can break or lose the capability of returning to their original shape”. The force, frequency and size of the extension will also influence how long the elastic lasts. “It is important to reduce the stress of the fibre over time” she says, “so selecting the correct garment size is an important consideration when purchasing next-to-skin garments such as underwear, bras and swimwear.” According to Quintero Rodriguez elastic fibres can be damaged by heat “so it is recommended to wash the garments with low temperature”. She suggests washing “the garments by hand or in a delicate/gentle machine cycle to avoid breakage of the fibre”. If machine washing is unavoidable, place the garments inside a washing bag to further reduce friction and protect the elasticity. Use a gentle detergent and keep elastic away from chemicals like chlorine and bleach, as they will also reduce its lifespan. Don’t put stretchy garments in the tumble drier for the same reason – the heat will damage the fibres. Instead, hang them up to dry, but be sure to dry anything with elastic or stretch out of sunlight. Nicole Mallalieu, a fashion lecturer at the Australian College of the Arts, warns that when “elastic goes, it goes”. Depending on the garment, replacing elastic can be easy – or very difficult. If the elastic is encased and “you can move the elastic within the folded over edge of the fabric” – like an elasticated waist band on a pair of pants or skirt – replacing it is relatively straightforward. She says to unpick a bit of the casing and pull the old elastic out. It may require a small snip with scissors. Then take your new elastic, thread it through the end of a hair clip or safety pin and feed the clip or pin back through the casing. Do this by pushing the pin along so the fabric gathers up around it, hold the pin while you pull the fabric back over the new elastic. Repeat until the pin emerges around the other side, then knot or stitch the elastic ends together and use a few stitches to close up the hole. If the elastic has been stitched or over locked into the waistband, Mallalieu says “it can be trickier to change it”. If you are confident with a sewing machine and very patient, she says you can unpick it and sew on new elastic. Keep in mind that the elastic will stretch as you stitch it on, so cut it slightly shorter than you need, pin it in place with the desired tension and hold the fabric taught as you feed it through the sewing machine. If unpicking seems too tedious, she suggests seeing it as an opportunity to refashion the garment by cutting the whole section off and sewing on something different like a wide, stretch band. If the straps on a bra or singlet have lost their elasticity, they can be replaced. Mallalieu says you can buy “bra elastic at haberdashery shops and quickly swap those out”. If you’re worried about not doing a good job, it might be worth taking the pieces to a tailor who can do a more polished repair. Mallalieu says once the elastic goes in stretchy garments like swimwear and underwear, or anything with ribbing, there isn’t much you can do. But if just part of the garment – like the cuffs of a hoodie – have become loose they can be replaced as long as you’re handy with a sewing machine. Remove the stretched out ribbing with scissors or an un-picker, fold the new fabric to form a loop that mimics the old one, and use a sewing machine to attach it. She says to look for similar fabric it at your local haberdashery, or pick a contrasting colour that will compliment the piece. “If you can’t match the fabric,” she says, “see it is an opportunity … to refashion the garment … you could put a ruffle on the end or some wild fringing”. Mallalieu points out that by the time the elastic has worn out, the rest of the garment is usually looking pretty tatty anyhow, so it might be time to relegate it to cleaning or gardening attire.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Picking up slack: how to repair broken elastic,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/08/picking-up-slack-how-to-repair-broken-elastic
3/8/2022,"Last year, Hannah Brauer was worried she had made a big mistake. After living in Byron Bay for over a decade, the brand manager had signed on to join the cast of a new Netflix reality show called Byron Baes. But as soon as the show was announced, locals quickly pushed back. There was a protest and a petition calling on the streaming service to abandon its plans. Several Byron businesses announced they would not allow the show to film on their property. The Byron shire mayor asked the council to oppose the production. “It was scary … I started second-guessing my decision to go on the show,” Brauer says now. “I was literally like, oh my god, what have I done? I’ve only ever felt comfortable living in this town. I’ve only ever felt loved within this town. Have I destroyed my Byron life by going on this show?” This week, after months of controversy about the reality show and the alleged conduct of some of the cast during New South Wales’s Covid restrictions, Byron Baes is set to start on Netflix – with both cast and crew hoping the final product will ease doubts about its intentions. Byron Baes follows the lives of a group of the town’s loosely connected social media influencers. Some of them – like Brauer – were approached over Instagram about being part of the series. In classic reality TV style, the cast is young, hot and largely single. There are feuds. There are love triangles. And there is drama over how authentic their social media presences really are. It’s that final point that sparked the protests: with Byron currently experiencing a very real housing and homelessness crisis, prominent locals and Indigenous leaders expressed concerns that the show would glorify Byron’s wealthier residents at the expense of its most vulnerable. Brauer understands the concerns that a glitzy reality show could encourage more to flock to the town and exacerbate its gentrification problem. “I totally get that. Even I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, I don’t want more people moving here when there’s already been ridiculous amounts of people that have moved here,’” she says. But she believes the protests began because of “the way [the show] was promoted” – sentiments echoed by another cast member, Jade Kevin Foster. “I feel like as soon as they heard the words ‘influencer’ and ‘baes’, they were off it,” Foster says. “I think they thought it was gonna take the piss out of Byron. And it’s not like that at all.” Que Minh Luu, the director of local content for Netflix Australia/New Zealand, says Netflix never considered canning Byron Baes, but that the community response did force them to “react, adjust and pivot in certain ways”, including where they would shoot. “I think we were all very, very surprised by it, in terms of the intensity of [the reaction],” she says. “But we also really understood that there is a real curiosity and scepticism of what it is that we’re trying to do. And I think – what I hope, what I feel and really have a lot of faith in – is that when people see the show, they will understand what it was that we were going in to do.” Netflix wants the show to explore the tension between how we present ourselves online and who we really are underneath. Luu believes the show has a cast who, despite their enviable social media presence, many Australians will relate to and connect with. Byron Baes is “in on the joke”, she says; having seen the first two episodes, that description feels accurate. As well as being delightfully funny, the show is self-aware and not afraid to laugh gently at Byron-isms like crystal collections and sound healings. It’s also full of quintessentially Australian moments, lines like “you can’t pay Big W prices and expect David Jones talent”, digs at the nearby Gold Coast for being “all about fake boobs and fake lips”. Those hyperlocal references were something Netflix encouraged, despite the fact that Byron Baes will be available on the streaming service globally (and, given the UK’s appetite for Australian reality television, sure to be devoured by international viewers). “At Netflix, the idea is make local content that is freakin’ local,” Luu says. “They don’t go, ‘Actually, no one [overseas] is gonna understand that Big W reference.’ They’re like, ‘More, do it more!’” Those foreign audiences may only see a certain side of Byron Bay when they tune in. But Luu says it’s unfair to expect the show to be everything to everyone, or to make a reality TV show the centre of debate over who gets access to “brand Byron”. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning “This show is about a particular group and a particular aspect of Byron,” she says. “I don’t think that people hear Real Housewives of Melbourne and assume that [represents] all of Melbourne.” After a tumultuous 11 months, the Netflix boss is excited for audiences to get to judge the show for themselves. Brauer hopes the release of Byron Baes will set the record straight – though she’ll be seeing its eight episodes for the first time as the viewers do too. “I’ve always only been a supporter of my town,” she says. “My friends that are on the show, who have been born and bred in Byron, don’t want people in the town thinking negatively of us, either.

The new program, to be announced on International Women’s Day by the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and the shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek, also aims to help school students seek support if they have experienced violence. Labor’s new commitment to consent education comes after a $32m pledge by the Morrison government to run a campaign targeting young people and their parents. The minister for women’s safety, Anne Ruston, said on Sunday the new campaign would encourage parents to talk to their children about consent, and equip parents “to have conversations with young people over 12 about consensual and respectful relationships through a suite of online resources”. The government will also give the Australian Human Rights Commission $5m to develop a survey in partnership with Chanel Contos, the activist founder of Teach Us Consent. Contos is part of a coalition of prominent women, including the former Australian of the year Grace Tame and the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, who on Sunday launched a fresh call for the Morrison government to implement significant policies to protect women and children from violence, harassment and discrimination. In a joint statement ahead of Tuesday’s policy launch, Albanese and Plibersek said Labor would “partner closely with state and territory governments, and school systems” to improve respect and relationships education. They said the commitment would allow principals to hire extra expert support, and develop respect and relationships education programs that are “based on evidence and tailored to their school”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Recent changes to the national school curriculum have strengthened the mandatory minimum standards for Australian children to learn about consent and respectful relationships,” Albanese and Plibersek said in a joint statement. “But delivery of high-quality respectful relationships education programs is patchy and inconsistent across the country”. “For example, there’s nowhere near enough support to train teachers properly in this kind of education, and some schools don’t have access to programs developed by experts. Too many school students are missing out on education that can help keep them safe”. Labor’s new commitment on consent education comes as Scott Morrison will use a speech to a business summit convened by the Australian Financial Review on Tuesday to outline areas of the economy where the government will seek to improve supply chain resilience. Morrison will identify seven initial categories of goods that the government is particularly focused on. These are semiconductors, agricultural chemicals, water treatment chemicals, telecommunications equipment, plastics, pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment. According to an extract of the prime minister’s speech circulated in advance, the prime minister will tell the event that the pandemic has demonstrated “the importance of domestic manufacturing to national health, security and resilience” and “brought into sharp focus the need to be constantly alert to supply chain vulnerabilities”. “A strong private sector continues to be our first line of defence,” Morrison will say. “Businesses know their business best and they are primarily responsible for supplying the vast majority of goods that Australians want and need”. “However, there have been examples of where government action is necessary to find a solution”.",News/Australia news,Federal Labor to pledge $77m for teachers to educate students about sexual consent,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/federal-labor-to-pledge-77m-for-teachers-to-educate-students-about-sexual-consent
3/8/2022,"Chef Pip Sumbak is running on empty. It’s been almost a week since Sumbak, along with fellow chef Wal Foster, devised a simple way to help flood victims in the New South Wales northern rivers. In the small kitchen of Byron Bay’s Bay Grocer, the pair decided to cook curry. The idea was to get what little food they could to those left stranded by the rising waters. Carried by a wave of community sentiment, it quickly morphed into a gargantuan food relief operation, involving much of Byron Bay’s hospitality sector. Sumbak and Foster suddenly and without training found themselves leaders of a makeshift emergency response, forced to move to the much larger Bangalow Moller Pavillion to facilitate the operation’s scale. Adrenaline twisted time into a blur. Sumbak, who usually cooks for Byron restaurant Pip’s Plate, wakes up barely recalling what happened the day prior. “I don’t even know what day it is,” she tells Guardian Australia from the pavilion. The volunteers estimate they have cooked a staggering 60,000 meals for flood victims, aided by $170,000 in donations and the participation of countless other businesses. They initially hoped to raise just $500. Food has been delivered by jet ski, dinghy, and private helicopter. They’ve fed people stranded on rooftops. Some hadn’t eaten for four days when the deliveries arrived. But now, like many who have selflessly stepped in to bridge the gaps in the government’s emergency response, they are ready to hand over. The presence of government, emergency services and the Australian defence force in the northern rivers is growing steadily, and the volunteers recognise it is time to let the professionals take over. The problem is, there’s still no sign anyone from government will step in to provide food relief, which is still sorely needed. “We are really exhausted, we haven’t stopped. The community has come together and no one’s stopped,” Sumbak says. “We’ve had no one tell us they’re taking care of this, food wise. There’s no official government service being offered. It seems so strange.” The sentiment is not uncommon. Frustration with the official government response has simmered in the Northern Rivers. There is a perception that, even now, not enough help is on hand for what is a mammoth recovery effort. The prime minister Scott Morrison on Monday said about 2,000 ADF personnel were now in the disaster zone, including 637 in NSW and 1,458 in Queensland. That is planned to more than double to 5,000 in coming days. “We know more support will be required, especially in Lismore and surrounding districts, where flood levels are reported to have peaked above all known records,” Morrison said. “In Lismore, it is not just a flood event, it is a catastrophic event.” Maj Gen David Thomae, the commander of the flood assistance operation, said defence personnel had already carried out 113 flood rescues and 79 helicopter missions. “We have done all we can with the conditions we have been faced with,” he said on Monday. “I’m very sorry for all of those people who have felt they haven’t been supported. I empathise completely with their plight. The scale of devastation has been extraordinary.” The defence minister Peter Dutton said on Sunday he would not tolerate criticism of the defence force’s response. Among those questioning the speed and scale of the ADF response are local helicopter pilots, which formed a group out of the Rotorwing hangar last Monday. They have volunteered their time, coordinating at least 200 rescue and airdrop missions to deliver food, medicines and petrol to about 5,000 people living in cut-off homes over a large area of north-east NSW. On Sunday, Roger Mohr of V2 Helicopters was in the air, one of 14 volunteer civilian helicopters forming part of the volunteer group. “There’s just so many civilian choppers up here, it’s a shame I haven’t come across the ADF up here,” he told the Guardian.",News/Australia news,Chefs lead volunteers to feed NSW flood victims in absence of government food relief,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/chefs-lead-volunteers-to-feed-nsw-flood-victims-in-absence-of-government-food-relief
3/8/2022,"Scott Morrison has declared the Coalition the “proven choice” of voters when it comes to managing Australia’s national security interests, but the latest Guardian Essential poll suggests respondents do not believe his government would handle the war between Russia and Ukraine any better than Labor. While the Coalition traditionally leads Labor on national security issues, the latest poll of 1,093 respondents has found voters do not yet have a clear preference, at least when it came to the Russian invasion. Asked which political party was better equipped to understand and react to the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, 24% of respondents said the Coalition, 24% said Labor, 33% said the stripe of the government made no difference, and 19% said they did not know. There was no unanimity about which party would best handle Australia’s response to the conflict, but a majority of respondents supported the Morrison government’s decision to provide military support to Ukraine to strengthen that country’s defences (57% were in favour, 16% opposed, while 27% neither supported nor opposed). This decision was supported by Labor. A larger majority of 68% also supported Australia supplying aid to Ukraine and taking refugees fleeing the conflict (10% of respondents were opposed to this, while 22% neither supported nor opposed humanitarian support). With the federal election now only weeks away, the Morrison government has pivoted away from pandemic management, and ramped up a domestic partisan brawl about national security, contending Labor is Beijing’s candidate at the coming poll. Morrison has tried to set up a khaki election contest, with global and regional instability as the backdrop. The prime minister hopes those atmospherics will benefit the incumbents. The change in the national conversation does not appear to have delivered a decisive benefit to the Coalition politically, although the latest data showed Labor’s primary vote had dropped three points in a fortnight. That negative movement was inside the Guardian Essential poll’s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points. More ominously for Morrison, the latest poll charts a steady increase in the number of voters who signalled it was time to change government. Last August, 36% of respondents said the Morrison government deserved to be re-elected. That was now down to 32%. Last August, 41% of respondents said it was time to give someone else a go at government. That was now up to 48% – a seven point negative movement for the Coalition in as many months. Voting intention figures, calculated by Guardian Essential, now expresses the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus”, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction.

Labor’s primary vote was 38%, up from 35% the previous fortnight, and the Coalition was on 35%, down from 37%, with the number of undecided voters going from 8% to 6%. In the latest survey, Labor’s primary vote is 35% (down three points), the Coalition on 36% (up one point) and the Greens on 10%. The latest two-party preferred “plus” result was basically unchanged in the current fortnight’s data, with Labor on 49%, the Coalition on 44%, and 7% of respondents undecided. Morrison remained ahead of his opponent on the better prime minister measure, preferred by 42% of respondents, while Anthony Albanese was on 34%, with 24% of respondents undecided. While the picture is level nationally, the data does suggest the Coalition has improved its position in Queensland over the past fortnight. In terms of primary voting intention, Labor has dropped from 39% to 29%, and the Coalition has gone from 34% to 40%. The Coalition enjoys a substantial electoral buffer in Queensland, courtesy of significant swings against Labor at the 2019 election. Labor is targeting four seats in the looming contest – Brisbane, Longman, Flynn and Leichardt. Albanese would struggle to form government if Labor achieved a positive swing, but could not gain ground in Queensland. Respondents were also asked a series of gender equity questions with International Women’s Day on 8 March. A majority of respondents (76%) thought there was still some way to go to achieve equality (17% disagreed and 7% were unsure). A majority (80%) would also favour legislation ensuring male and female employees were paid the same for doing the same work (13% disagreed and 7% were unsure). But a majority (59%) agreed with the statement that “work to achieve gender equality today benefits mostly well-to-do people”.",News/Australia news,"Morrison wants khaki election but voters aren’t convinced Coalition best to handle war, survey suggests",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/morrison-wants-khaki-election-but-voters-arent-convinced-coalition-best-to-handle-war-survey-suggests
3/8/2022,"AGL Energy says it is not sure whether an unsolicited takeover bid by billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian fund manager Brookfield is really over – or if the consortium has just hit the “pause button”. AGL dismissed an increased offer of $8.25 a share made late on Friday. It valued the company at about $8.5bn including debt. “We think that [the revised bid] is still well short of what is traditionally required in these kinds of circumstances,” Graeme Hunt, AGL’s chief executive, said while declining to say what sum would have enticed the board to engage with the suitors. In the wake of the rejection, AGL’s shares ended Monday down 13 cents, or 1.75%, at $7.30. The overall market declined about 1%. Hunt said shareholders would gain more confidence in the company’s plans as it released more information about the looming mid-year split into two. One entity will house the 185-year-old company’s power plants and the other its retailing arm. But Hunt said he would not rule out Brookfield, which had led the bidding, and Cannon-Brookes may yet make another offer after the founder and part-owner of Atlassian tweeted on Sunday night the consortium was “putting our pens down”. The Brookfield-Grok consortium looking to take private & transform AGL is putting our pens down - with great sadness.This weekend, the board rejected our raised offer of $8.25. 46% more than the price of $5.55 about 90 days ago 🧵 (1/3) pic.twitter.com/c5KYwGozDo “We had no conversation with Cannon-Brookes at all, and what he means by that, I have no idea,” Hunt said. Brookfield, though, indicated they wanted to “get on with life”. “Whether they’re hitting the pause button, or they’re walking away, who knows?” Hunt said. “I guess that’s a question for them.” Spokespeople for Brookfield and Grok Ventures, Cannon-Brookes’ family investment company, said they had nothing to add to AGL’s public rejection of the bid. But people within AGL remain convinced that the consortium’s interest in AGL is not over and that the duo hasn’t made its final sortie. “They’re not done,” was one view. It’s understood that how shareholders respond to the rejection in coming weeks will be watched closely by the consortium, as will the formal release of AGL’s demerger plans due by mid-May. One source also highlighted Cannon-Brookes’ tweet saying that the demerger path was “a terrible outcome for shareholders, taxpayers, customers, Australia and the planet we all share”. That assessment hadn’t changed. Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield had proposed accelerating the closure of AGL’s coal-fired power plants so that the company, which now accounts for about 8% of Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions, would be carbon neutral by 2035. Along with the takeover price, the consortium said they were prepared to pour $20bn to meet that goal, including closing all three remaining AGL coal plants by 2030. Hunt declined to provide a “threshold” price that would have attracted board interest in the bid, adding only that the 15% premium to the one-month average price was not a fair price. “We see very clearly that by splitting the company, there’s more value to be unlocked,” he said. Hunt said there was also “more scope” to accelerate its own timetable of coal plant closure, depending on how the electricity sector developed in coming years. Its Liddell plant in the NSW Hunter Valley will close by April 2023, with uncertainly only over the timing of the nearby Bayswater plant and Loy Yang A in Victoria. Last month, AGL put a closure date of no later than 2033 for Bayswater and 2045 for Loy Yang A, but offered a “window” of several years earlier for both. “It relies on projects and relies on planning, and the rise of approvals all the way from generation through to firming capacity to transmission and distribution,” Hunt said. “All of that may well lead to earlier [closure] dates than are on the table at the moment.” “We are not saying we should not decarbonise,” he said. “What we’re saying is we need to do that in such a way that the glide path does not lead to a crash landing or runway overshoot.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning What may increase, though, are energy prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions. AGL mines its own brown coal at Loy Yang and has a couple of years of relatively cheap black coal for its Hunter plants locked in, offering it some shield to higher fuel prices. However, gas prices, which often influence power prices, are soaring. “We’ve seen coal prices go up very, very much in the last few weeks as a result of what’s happening in Europe, and similarly with gas,” Hunt said. “All of those all kinds of uncertainties all point towards higher energy prices,” he said. “It’s just a question of how much, for how long.”",News/Australia news,AGL Energy chief executive uncertain if takeover bid is really over,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/agl-energy-chief-executive-uncertain-if-takeover-bid-is-really-over
3/8/2022,"The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) has been discovered in more than 40 piggeries across Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia within the past month. Human cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE), the disease caused by JEV, have emerged and one person was in intensive care on Monday. The federal health department on Friday declared Japanese encephalitis a communicable disease incident of national significance. The agriculture minister, David Littleproud, told the ABC’s Radio National on Monday that there was no doubt climate change and extreme weather was playing a role in its spread. “The fact that it has effectively spread right across the eastern seaboard into South Australia says that this is a real threat that we need to take seriously,” he said. The disease is spread by mosquito bites and occurs mostly in pigs and horses, and sometimes in humans. This means pig farmers and people who work around piggeries in affected regions are most at risk. It spreads through mosquitoes carrying it from either pigs or water birds, but it doesn’t transmit from animal to animal, animal to human (other than mosquitoes), or human to human. You can’t catch it from eating pig or other animal products, so the virus does not present a food safety threat. While horses and donkeys may be infected with the virus, they do not develop high enough levels of it in the blood to infect mosquitoes, so those animals are not involved in the spread. Waterbirds, particularly wading birds such as herons and egrets, are the main source as they hold enough virus in their blood to infect mosquitoes for up to seven days. Pigs are the other major amplifiers of the virus, developing high enough viral levels in their blood to infect mosquitoes for around four days. If any animal is suspected of having JEV in Australia, it must be reported either to a vet or the national emergency animal disease hotline. The signs to look for in animals are here. About 99% of JEV infections cause no symptoms, and of those who do get sick most will experience mild, cold-like symptoms. But in serious cases it can cause your brain to swell. Among those who have symptoms that lead to a Japanese encephalitis diagnosis, the fatality rate is 25-30%. The most concerning symptoms to be aware of are severe headache, neck stiffness, fever, sensitivity to light and sound, and movement difficulties, as these may indicate a brain inflammation known as encephalitis. About 30-50% of survivors of encephalitis caused by JEV have permanent complications involving damage to the central nervous system, resulting in cognitive, sensory and movement issues. Elderly people, immunocompromised and those under five are particularly vulnerable to serious disease. Prof Peter Collignon, who has studied the ways humans, the environment and animals interact to cause disease, said any patient presenting to hospitals in eastern Australia with encephalitis and where a cause could not be identified were having blood samples taken so they could be tested for JEV. Collignon said authorities should also be looking for antibodies in certain populations to see how many people may have had it, since so few end up with severe disease. “We also need to find any pig with Japanese encephalitis and make sure we actually get rid of those pigs.” There are no treatments for Japanese encephalitis. Protection from mosquito bites is key. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, urged people in areas of high mosquito activity in eastern Australia to use mosquito repellent containing picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or DEET, on all exposed skin. “Wear long, loose-fitting clothing when outside, and ensure accommodation, including tents, are properly fitted with mosquito nettings or screens,” he said. Littleproud said anything you can do to keep mosquitoes away from you and your animals will help. “Whether that’s placing mosquito traps around pig pens or putting a hooded rug and some mosquito repellent on your horses.” There are two JE vaccines in Australia – one is available to children aged 9 months and older, the other to adults. Usually, the vaccine is only advised for people travelling to Asia and the Torres Strait Island region of Australia, and those travelling in rural areas and undertaking certain activities with increased risk of exposure, or spending a month or more in endemic regions. People who work with animals in Australia can also choose to be vaccinated against the disease. But with seven people with the virus in hospital in Victoria (including two NSW residents) on Monday and other hospitalised cases in NSW and Queensland, Littleproud said vaccines were being distributed to farmers in high-risk areas. Another order of vaccines was on the way. A vaccine for horses and pigs is available in countries where Japanese encephalitis is endemic, but no vaccines for animals are registered for use in Australia. Japanese encephalitis is primarily a rural and agricultural disease endemic in parts of Asia, where it is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis. It is also endemic in animals in parts of the Torres Strait region. It is not known how the virus has come into Australia this time, the Department of Agriculture said. JEV was first detected in northern Australia in 1995 amid a widespread outbreak on the Torres Strait Islands. It was then detected on the Australian mainland in 1998 in Cairns. Despite fears it may proliferate, only occasional Japanese encephalitis cases cropped up in subsequent years, all of them in far north Queensland. A strong vaccination program in the Torres Strait Island region meant human cases were limited there, helping to protect Australia. The paper also said a lack of hosts, given only limited animals such as horses and pigs can infect mosquitoes, and competition with other viruses, also limited spread within Australia. Littleproud said it was “because of the changing climate”. He said the waterways in which migratory birds have been able to come south is one of the reasons the chief veterinary officer, Mark Schipp, believes JEV has spread across the country. “We’ve had extreme weather conditions again this year where obviously there’s rain that’s been falling right across the east coast,” he said. “There is a lot more water around, and these migratory birds come further because of the availability of water. And that means the risks are greater.” A paper published in 2019 in the Annals of Global Health said: “Global warming can cause not only mosquito vectors to invade higher elevations and latitudes but also an increase in rainfall, facilitating increased breeding of JE vectors.” Collignon said it’s too early to say. “If pigs are the major reservoir, we can possibly get rid of it,” he said. “The problem with other mosquito-borne viruses like Ross River virus is kangaroos and marsupials are the reservoir, and they’re everywhere. “However, Australia’s got a lot of wild pigs. If JE is actually in those animals and not just in farm animals, that might make it difficult to stamp out. “That’s why we need a lot more information and to work out how many people have had it, how many pigs have got it, and in which areas. With all the rain and mosquitoes around at the moment, it does also make the risk worse.”",News/Australia news,What is Japanese encephalitis and why is it spreading in Australia?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/08/what-is-japanese-encephalitis-and-why-is-it-spreading-in-australia
3/8/2022,"Wet weather along the east coast of Australia has led to an early bumper mushroom season, prompting warnings about the risks of poisoning. Toadstools have grown abundantly in urban parks and back yards in New South Wales in recent weeks, driven by the wettest summer in three decades in parts of the state. Mushroom season usually begins in early autumn as the weather starts to cool down, according to fungi expert Dr Brett Summerell, who is the director of research at the Australian Institute of Botanical Science. “But there have been quite a lot of mushrooms right through summer with the wetter weather,” Summerell said. “There’s no doubt over the last couple of weeks they’ve really started to pop up absolutely everywhere.” “[Fungi] need a fair amount of water to be able to fruit and produce what we call sporophytes – the mushrooms and other fruiting structures,” he said. “I’m sure we will see a huge diversity this year because it’s just been such ideal conditions for them.” One fungus to look out for is the ghost mushroom, which emits a soft green glow at night. This species and other bioluminescent mushrooms usually crop up later in the season, Summerell said, appearing along the coast “from the north down to the south as the temperatures cool down”. Though the idea of a fungi feast may be tempting, mycologists advise against consuming edible-looking mushrooms. “Unless you’re an expert or with an expert, it’s really not worth picking the mushrooms,” Summerell said. In recent weeks he has noticed many species that look similar in appearance to field mushrooms, but some of them are toxic. “There are species like yellow stainers … that look superficially quite like the edible ones, but can cause quite unpleasant [symptoms].” It’s a lesson Sydneysider Jonathan Herrman learned last week, when he was hospitalised after consuming a “thumbnail-sized” bite of a mushroom from his front lawn. “We’ve had weeks and weeks of rain in Sydney and [they] popped up again and again,” Herrman said. He first rubbed a piece of the mushroom against his skin, and licked the toadstool about 20 minutes before taking a small bite. “It was the same as biting into a mushroom in Coles. It wasn’t immediately bitter, so I thought nothing of it.” Two hours later, Herrman began to experience violent vomiting and diarrhoea, and ended up in hospital for two days. “I’ve never felt that sick in my life,” he said. Experts have since told him the toxic mushroom he consumed could have been Chlorophyllum molybdites, commonly known as the false parasol, or the vomiter. Herrman said he felt thankful that the ingestion had not led to liver or kidney failure, which other mushrooms species can cause. “I did a very stupid thing,” he said. “We all make mistakes.” The NSW Poisons Information Centre said it had received 73 calls about mushroom exposures since the start of the year to 3 March. Of the calls, 16 were the result of adults deliberately eating mushrooms. Another 45 were accidental exposures, 80% of which were in children under five. “Poisonous mushrooms in Australia can look like edible mushrooms from Europe and Asia and changes in the appearance of mushrooms during the life cycle make it difficult to identify safely,” said Genevieve Adamo of the NSW Poisons Information Centre in a statement. “Changes in environmental conditions mean toxic mushrooms can grow in a spot where previously only edible mushrooms grew,” she said. In 2012, two people died in Canberra after eating death cap mushrooms at a New Year’s Eve dinner party. Death caps are relatively uncommon but more prevalent in cooler areas, Summerell said. They are mycorrhizal fungi, which form a symbiotic relationship with tree roots. “They’re almost always associated with oak trees,” he said. The toxin in the death cap, which is not a native species to Australia, cannot be destroyed by cooking or drying. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The communications director at the Food Safety Information Council (FSIC), Lydia Buchtmann, said the council’s advice was to avoid touching or eating wild mushrooms. “It is almost impossible to distinguish a death cap or other poisonous mushrooms from edible ones,” she said. The FSIC noted last month that fruiting of death caps had occurred much earlier than usual, with reports of the mushrooms around Canberra and the Adelaide Hills region since Christmas. “Check your garden, especially if you have pets and small children, and remove any mushrooms using gloves wrap and dispose in the garbage,” Buchtmann said.",News/Environment,Mushroom season starts early on Australia’s east coast prompting warnings,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/08/mushroom-season-starts-early-on-australias-east-coast-prompting-warnings
3/8/2022,"In September 2016 I was invited by my Greek friend George Perris to perform with him and Greek tenor Mario Frangoulis at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, which is overlooked by the Parthenon in Athens. It was the most exquisite venue I have ever had the privilege to play. I’ve been fortunate enough to play some extraordinary venues – the Sydney Opera House (the view and location is just otherworldly and it’s in our back yard); the Royal Albert Hall in London is something I really loved – but there was something about the Herodes Atticus that was magical and mystical. Performing in an outdoor stone auditorium – a Greek theatre in the true sense of the word – that is almost 2,000 years old, and to experience how the natural acoustics resonate, was a profound experience for me. I remember walking out there and having shivers. As you walk up the stone stairs with their wrought-iron balustrade handrail, behind, there’s a massive poster of Maria Callas adorning that very stage. It was taken towards the end of her life (she died, around my age now, in Paris) and she has several bouquets of flowers in her hands. She was a guttural and instinctive performer who stood up for what she believed in. She was misunderstood – as a lot of strong women are unfortunately – but she gave the world a gift that continues to bowl us over. So when I was walking out on stage with Maria Callas looking over my shoulder, I just thought: “Oh my god, this is really happening.” It was a pinch-me moment. I was wearing an outfit by Martin Grant – an Australian couturier and designer based in Paris. It was a very elegant, almost Audrey Hepburn-like outfit – a beautiful silk tulle skirt and shirt with handmade earrings. The concert was actually a George Perris special that was being recorded by PBS – the American Public Broadcasting Service – and I was the special guest. Beforehand, I was quietly very, very nervous. Backstage, I did some vocal exercises to open my throat up – lots of shrilling and vowel sounds – and tried to stay hydrated and calm. On stage, I started by performing three or four of my own songs and then George joined me towards the end of my set to sing I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You from The Mask of Zorro soundtrack.

Beforehand, the boys put me through my paces and were like: “Oh yeah yeah yeah, you can sing in Greek, come on,” and I’m like, “God almighty!” We only ran through it three or four times in the afternoon and I had to try and get my head around the lyrics. I kept thinking to myself: “This is extraordinary, don’t drop the ball.” Anyway, I got through it and finished the show with a standing ovation. It was a full house of more than 5,000 people and the audience were incredibly appreciative and demonstrative. I felt like I belonged there. I feel very at home in Europe. I love Europe for that dramatic sensibility – it’s part of my culture. My earliest influences were the Italian and French singers, particularly women, who wore spectacular costumes and had amazing sets. I have a love for most things Greek – the literature, the architecture, the history, the humility and the warmth of the people. I grew up in Melbourne with a lot of Greeks and my mother and father are both born and bred Sicilians. The Greeks at one stage ruled Sicily, so there’s a phenomenal amount of cultural similarities. When I stepped off that stage I was euphoric. Afterwards, we all went to dinner at a roof terrace restaurant that overlooked the Acropolis. That’s what you do in Greece – you do a gig and then you go out for dinner late at night. We just sat out there and took in that extraordinary view and felt grateful to be alive.
