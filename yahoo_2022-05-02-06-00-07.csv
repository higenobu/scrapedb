MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell returned to Twitter on Sunday, after the executive was permanently banned from the platform in 2021 for spreading election-related conspiracy theories. ""Hello everybody, I'M BACK ON TWITTER. My only account is @MikeJLindell! Please RT and FOLLOW to SPREAD THE WORD,"" Lindell wrote in a tweet shared Sunday afternoon. While the account is currently unverified, the announcement includes a self-shot video of Lindell urging Twitter users to follow him and cautioning against imitators. ""All those other ones are fake accounts and they've been using my name out there, so we started this account,"" he said in the video. ""Please share with everybody you know, let everybody you know, so we can get the word out at Twitter in case they do take it down. Thanks a lot for helping out."" Twitter did not immediately respond to Insider's request to comment on the account and whether it was condoned by the company. However, several Twitter users responded flagging the platform's ban evasion policy, which states on its website it forbids ""attempts to circumvent prior enforcement, including through the creation of new accounts."" While the details surrounding Lindell's Twitter return remain unknown, it comes just a week after Elon Musk purchased the social platform for $44 billion, a takeover rife with speculation that the billionaire plans on changing policies to relax moderation in favor of increased freedom of speech. Lindell was one of several high-profile figures who was permanently banned for spreading misinformation tied to the 2020 election, following the suspension of former president Donald Trump in January 2021. YouTube and Vimeo also removed Lindell's two-hour film about the election, ""Absolute Proof,"" from their platforms. According to a recent report from the Wall Street Journal, Musk is dismayed that Trump is still barred from the platform, though the former president has previously stated he does not intend to return to the site. ""I hope Elon buys Twitter because he'll make improvements to it and he is a good man, but I am going to be staying on TRUTH,"" Trump told Fox News.

The region's governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a local resident suffered minor injuries and his life was not in danger. There were no immediate comments from the defence ministry. Images posted to social media showed a large funnel of smoke rising above the ground. Separately, governor of the Kursk region which also shares a border with Ukraine said that a railway bridge had been damaged on a line used by freight trains. Its governor Roman Starovoit called the incident an act of sabotage. Russia last month accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack on a fuel depot in Belgorod, for which Kyiv denied responsibility, as well as shelling villages and firing missiles at an ammunition depot. Other Russian regions that share a border with Ukraine have also reported cross-border shelling incidents since the invasion. ​​Follow the latest updates below. Thanks for joining our live updates. That's it until the morning, so here's a summary of the latest developments. The United Nations confirmed it is conducting a long-awaited ""safe passage operation"" for civilians from the Azovstal steel works in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. Some 40 civilians managed to leave on Saturday evening, more than the 20 initially thought to have fled, raising hopes for the around 1,000 civilians and Ukrainian troops who remain trapped in the besieged plant where rescue efforts have been hampered by repeated delays. One person was injured in a fire on a Russian defence ministry facility in the southern Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, Belgorod region governor said on Sunday. Pope Francis on Sunday described the war in Ukraine as a ""macabre regression of humanity"" that makes him ""suffer and cry"", calling for humanitarian corridors to evacuate people trapped in the Mariupol steelworks. US Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has told Ukraine's president that ""we are on the frontier of freedom"" as she became the latest political leader to visit Kyiv. Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday it had struck at weapons supplied to Ukraine by the United States and European countries and destroyed a runway at a military airfield near the Ukrainian city of Odesa. Russia probably aims to exert strong political and economic influence on Ukraine's southern region of Kherson in the long term, after ruling out its return to Ukrainian control and initiating a currency switch to the rouble, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said. The first group of civilians has been evacuated from Mariupol's besieged Azovstal steelworks since Vladimir Putin ordered it to be sealed off, Ukrainian commanders trapped inside say. Some 40 civilians managed to leave on Saturday evening, more than the 20 initially thought to have fled, though it is not known if they have reached the agreed safety point in Zaporizhzhia, which is controlled by Ukraine. The giant steelworks is the final pocket of Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol, the southern port city that has been devastated by Russian forces. Around 1,000 civilians and Ukrainian troops remain trapped. The evacuation convoy had vehicles bearing United Nations symbols, raising hopes that a deal may have been reached to ease the most destructive siege of the conflict. Svyatoslav Palamar, the deputy commander of the Azov Regiment, said that after an evacuation convoy arrived on Saturday night, ""we have brought 20 civilians to the agreed meeting point, whom we've managed to rescue from under the rubble - these are women and children"". But Mariupol's mayor, Vadym Boychenko, echoed the commander's call for the many wounded still awaiting evacuation from the plant after weeks of delays, telling the BBC that people are ""on the borderline between life and death"". Stalin called artillery the “god of war”. The physical and psychological damage caused by the sudden arrival of high explosive rounds can shatter military formations. Defended positions and attackers alike can be devastated in a few seconds of chaos and carnage. As the war in Ukraine moves away from the urban areas of Kyiv and other cities towards the more open areas of the Donbas, artillery will once again become a dominating feature. Dominic Nicholls has this analysis The United Nations is conducting a ""safe passage operation"" for civilians from the Azovstal steel works in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, a spokesperson for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Sunday. The operation began on April 29 and is being coordinated with the International Committee of the Red Cross, Russia and Ukraine, the spokesperson, Saviano Abreu, told Reuters. He said the operation arrived at the steel works on Saturday morning. He added that no further details could be released so as not to jeopardise the safety of evacuees and the convoy. One person was injured in a fire on a Russian defence ministry facility in the southern Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, Belgorod region governor said on Sunday. Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a local resident suffered minor injuries and his life was not in danger. There were no immediate comments from the defence ministry. Images posted to social media showed a large funnel of smoke rising above the ground. Reuters could not verify the reports. Russia last month accused Ukraine of a helicopter attack on a fuel depot in Belgorod, for which Kyiv denied responsibility, as well as shelling villages and firing missiles at an ammunition depot. Other Russian regions that share a border with Ukraine have also reported cross-border shelling incidents since Moscow sent thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a ""special military operation"". A Russian MP has labelled Great Britain “more evil” than the United States in an impassioned tirade on state TV, where the UK was also accused of stealing the “Russian” invention of fish and chips. Andrei Isayev, a pro-Kremlin politician, said that of “that couple that we constantly mention,” the UK has “of course historically” been “more hardcore anti-Russian” than the US. He said: “They’re basically Siamese twins, or two heads of a dragon, but Britain has historically been the more evil head of the dragon because in that couple it has responsibility for Europe.” He also opined that the UK and Poland were “seriously discussing the possibility of a direct military clash” with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Read more here A wider evacuation of civilians from Ukraine's mostly Russian-controlled southeastern port city of Mariupol could be possible on Sunday, local officials said. Mariupol's city council and the local governor told residents who wished to leave for the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia to gather at an evacuation point in Mariupol at 4 p.m. local time (1300 GMT). It comes after a group of 40 civilians was evacuated on Sunday from Mariupol's Azovstal steel works in a convoy with vehicles bearing United Nations symbols, signalling a deal had been struck to ease the siege. In one of the first major signs of an evacuation deal, a group of around 40 civilians arrived on Sunday at a temporary accommodation centre after leaving the area around the Azovstal plant, a Reuters photographer said. Reuters photographs showed the civilians arriving in the village of Bezimenne in the Donetsk Region, around 30 km east of Mariupol, with Ukrainian number plates in a convoy with Russian forces and vehicles with United Nations symbols. The European Union is leaning towards a ban on imports of Russian oil by the end of the year, two EU diplomats said, after talks between the European Commission and EU member states this weekend. The European Union is preparing a sixth package of sanctions against Russia over the invasion just over two months ago of Ukraine that Moscow calls a special military operation. The package is expected to target Russian oil, Russian and Belarusian banks, as well as more individuals and companies, Reuters reports. The Commission, which is coordinating the EU response, held talks dubbed ""confessionals"" with small groups of EU countries and will aim to firm up its sanctions plan in time for a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday. EU energy ministers are also due to meet in the Belgian capital on Monday to discuss the issue. Pope Francis on Sunday described the war in Ukraine as a ""macabre regression of humanity"" that makes him ""suffer and cry"", calling for humanitarian corridors to evacuate people trapped in the Mariupol steelworks. Speaking to thousands of people in St. Peter's Square for his noon blessing, Pope Francis again implicitly criticised Russia. In Roman Catholicism, the month of May is dedicated to Mary, the Mother of God. The Pope asked for month-long prayers for peace in Ukraine. ""My thoughts go immediately to the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the city of Mary, barbarously bombarded and destroyed,"" he said of the mostly Russian-controlled southeastern port city, which is named after Mary. ""I suffer and cry thinking of the suffering of the Ukrainian population, in particular the weakest, the elderly, the children,"" he said. Russia has turned an old factory in Saint Petersburg into a so-called troll farm to spread disinformation and target Kremlin critics, including world leaders, according to UK government-funded research disclosed Sunday. The site in the Russian city is allegedly being used to ""spread lies"" on social media and in comment sections of popular websites, Britain's Foreign Office said in a statement detailing what it called a ""sick"" operation. The Foreign Office, which will share the research with social media platforms, claimed it found paid employees of the troll factory were targeting politicians as well as musicians and bands, in countries including Britain, South Africa and India. They use online platforms to recruit new sympathisers who then target the social media profiles of Kremlin critics, spamming them with comments backing Russian President Vladimir Putin and the war. The trolls have targeted the accounts of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other UK ministers, alongside those of world leaders, the research said. Social media accounts of bands and musicians including Daft Punk, David Guetta, Tiesto and Rammstein also appear to have been targeted by the disinformation operation, it found. ""The war in Ukraine is our war – it is everyone’s war... because Ukraine’s victory is a strategic imperative for all of us,"" Liz Truss said in her Mansion House speech this week. ""We are doubling down. We will keep going further and faster to push Russia out of the whole of Ukraine."" With those words, the Foreign Secretary made it official. Britain may not be directly at war with Russia in Ukraine, but indirectly it is most certainly in a Cold War, a proxy war. For the first time, Britain, and by extension the wider Western alliance, is publicly committed to Kyiv’s own war aims. It is a dramatic shift. More analysis here from Roland Oliphant Russia's defence ministry said on Sunday it had struck at weapons supplied to Ukraine by the United States and European countries and destroyed a runway at a military airfield near the Ukrainian city of Odesa. The ministry said it used high-precision Onyx missiles to strike the airfield, after Ukraine accused Russia of knocking out a newly-constructed runway at the main airport of Odesa. Odesa regional governor Maksym Marchenko said Russia had used a Bastion missile, launched from Crimea. Reuters could not immediately verify the reports. Russia's defence ministry also said its air defence systems had shot down two Ukrainian Su-24m bombers over the Kharkiv region overnight. Two groups of civilians left the residential area around the Azovstal steel works in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol on Saturday, Russian news agencies cited the defence ministry as saying on Sunday. The ministry said a total of 46 civilians had left the area and were provided with food and shelter, RIA and TASS reported. Ukraine put the figure at 20 - and said it is not known if the group of women and children have reached the agreed safety point in Zaporizhzhia, territory which is controlled by Ukraine. Multiple evacuation attempts have failed in the besieged steel plant, where more than 1,000 civilians and Ukrainian troops are trapped in a last pocket of resistance. Ukraine's foreign minister has asked China to provide security guarantees for Kyiv, in some of the most direct criticisms of Moscow recently published by Beijing's state media. Western powers and Ukraine have repeatedly urged China to condemn Russia's invasion, with the US threatening consequences if Beijing provides military or economic support to Moscow. ""Ukraine is currently studying the possibility of acquiring security guarantees from permanent members of the UN Security Council, including China, and other major powers,"" Dmytro Kuleba was quoted as saying by official news agency Xinhua. ""We propose that China becomes one of the guarantors of Ukraine's security, this is a sign of our respect and trust in the People's Republic of China."" China in 2013 pledged to provide Ukraine with ""security guarantees"" if it is ever invaded or threatened with nuclear attack, but appeared evasive during this war. Russia probably aims to exert strong political and economic influence on Ukraine's southern region of Kherson in the long term, after ruling out its return to Ukrainian control and initiating a currency switch to the rouble, the UK's Ministry of Defence has said. ""Since seizing ... Kherson in early March, Russia has sought to legitimise its control of the city and surrounding areas through installing a pro-Russian administration,"" the MoD said in its latest intelligence update. Russia's enduring control of the region and transport links will benefit its ability to sustain advances to the north and west and improve its security control of the nearby Crimea, it added.

5/2/2022,"There's new a drone on the battlefield. Only six months old, video of it in action is still secret. Unlike armed drones that carry weapons under the wings, launching them and returning to base, the Switchblade ""kamikaze"" drone carries its own warhead, and blows itself up – taking out tanks, armored vehicles and artillery nests with it. ""It's a one-and-done drone,"" said Wahid Nawabi, who runs Aerovironment, which makes the Switchblade at a secure location he's asked us not to reveal. So far 700 Switchblades – both large and small -- are being sent to Ukraine to be used against the Russians. ""We understand what the people in Ukraine are doing. This is our part to help,"" said John Aldana, the program manager for the Switchblade. He explained to CBS News national security correspondent David Martin why the drone – a missile placed in its launcher with its wings folded – is called the Switchblade: ""It fits inside this tube. At the bottom we have what is known as a gas generator. It pushes the Switchblade out. Once it's clear of the tube, the wings automatically flip out, and it happens very quickly, just like a switchblade."" In the nose are cameras which scan the battlefield, sending video back to an operator controlling the Switchblade from a tablet ""Once it finds the target, the operator has the ability to essentially dive bomb into the target and take out the target,"" said Aldana. ""It's a one-way mission."" Crates containing Switchblades are already being loaded for Ukraine. ""We've been in touch with the Ukrainian military,"" said Nawabi. ""They could use thousands of them. The type of conflict they're engaged with today really is almost ideal for the Switchblade capability."" He's talking specifically about the long Russian convoys creeping toward the front lines. ""Switchblade can just literally take them out like popcorn, literally,"" he said. Martin asked, ""Is the enemy going to hear it?"" ""No. It's very, very quiet,"" said Aldana. ""But if you look up you can see it?"" ""Well, it's not easy, right? I mean, it looks big on a table, but when it's in the sky it's very hard to see."" When asked if a Switchblade can be shot down, Aldana replied, ""As far as I know, it's never happened."" But the signals which control the Switchblade can be jammed, and so far only 100 have reached the battlefield. Still, the weapon has earned Wahid Nawabi a place (along with Vice President Kamala Harris) on the list of Americans whom Russia has sanctioned. It's not his first encounter with the Russians. ""I was born and raised in Afghanistan,"" Nawabi said. ""I left Afghanistan right at the beginning of the occupation of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan back in the early 1980s, so in some respect, this is very emotional and personal for me as well."" At the age of 14, the oldest of four children, he learned what happens when the Russian army invades your country. ""I've been there. I know exactly what it's like. Life changes in a matter of seconds, completely changes upside-down."" And he remembers how one weapon, the American-made Stinger missile, helped chase the Russians out of Afghanistan. ""I vividly remember the Stinger missile,"" he told Martin. ""I saw what it did to the Russian helicopters. Probably have seen a half a dozen of them with my own naked eyes get shot from the sky while watching from the ground."" Now he wants to see Russian tanks destroyed by his Switchblade drones. ""A capability that you cannot hear, you cannot see, you cannot tell where it came from, and boom! All of a sudden it hits you,"" he said. ""Just creates havoc in your mind: 'Oh my God, what is this? What's happening to us?'"" For more info: Switchblade Drone (Aerovironment)Aerovironment Story produced by Mary Walsh. Editor: Carol Ross. See also: U.S. arms to Ukraine: Is it enough?
