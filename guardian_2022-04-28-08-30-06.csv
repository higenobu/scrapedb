4/28/2022,"Amber Heard dated Elon Musk while trying to reconcile with Johnny Depp, the couple’s former talent agent testified Wednesday in Depp’s $50m defamation case against his ex-wife. Christian Carino, an agent at Creative Artists Agency who had represented Depp and Heard, said that Heard had “spent time” with Musk, the Tesla car and SpaceX aerospace company owner while she sought to resurrect her relationship with Depp in 2016, the jury heard at Fairfax county court, Virginia, where the trial is taking place. This was two months after she had made allegations of domestic violence against Depp, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor, and the couple had separated, the court heard. “You told me a thousand times you were just filling space,” Carino texted Heard about Musk in 2017. “You weren’t in love with him.” Seeking Carino’s advice on Depp, Heard texted: “God, I miss him.” In another exchange, Heard texted Carino: “I hate it that yet again a man lets me fall on the spikes by myself.” Carino responded: “If you don’t like your personal life being in the press, don’t date famous men. You could stop that if you stop dating uber-famous people.” The agent also testified that he never saw Depp abuse Heard or saw injuries on Heard, but that her accusations against him had negatively affected his career. “People do not want to know that someone they look up to is in litigation,” Carino said. A year earlier, the agent arranged for Heard to meet with Depp at a friend’s house in San Francisco, despite Heard’s temporary restraining order against Depp still being in force, on condition she would never accuse him of violating the order. The estranged couple, Carino said, spoke for hours “inches apart” on the patio before shifting their location to a hotel, where an argument began. The testimony came after three Los Angeles police officers who responded to a 911 call on 21 May 2016 told the court they did not see any evidence of physical harm on Amber Heard who, six days later, sought a restraining order against Depp citing domestic violence against her that night. Officer William Gatlin, one of the dispatched officers to the Eastern Columbia building in downtown Los Angeles, where Depp owned five penthouses, testified that when officers arrived, the female at the residence refused to cooperate and showed no signs of physical injury. Based upon her refusal to give any statement on what had occurred and at the time we did not observe verifiable injuries to her,” Gatlin said. Another woman in the apartment, Gatlin said, had told the officers “everything was fine.” Officer Tyler Hadden, one of the officers who responded earlier that evening, acknowledged that Heard had been crying and was red-faced. “Just because I see a female with pink cheeks and pink eyes doesn’t mean something happened,” Hadden said in a deposition. The officers have testified that Depp was not at the penthouse when they arrived and recorded the incident as “verbal argument only” in the logs. They testified they were they aware of who Amber Heard was, or that she was married to Depp. Neither Heard nor anyone at the penthouse complex had been willing to tell them who Heard’s husband was. Later that May, Heard filed for divorce and went to a Los Angeles courthouse to seek a temporary restraining order against Depp, showing up with a clear mark on her face which she claimed Depp had inflicted on the night in question. The pictures taken outside the court, together with Heard’s allegations, Depp claims, marked the start of his career and reputation unravelling. The fifty-eight-year-old actor says he never hit Heard, her allegations of domestic violence are contrived, and it was she who perpetrated violence during their marriage. Heard’s lawyers have yet to make their case to jurors.Depp claims that he was defamed when Heard wrote an op-ed piece in The Washington Post in 2018 referring to herself as “a public figure representing domestic abuse.” The trial continues.",Arts/Film,‘Don’t date famous men’: former talent agent testifies in Depp v Heard trial,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/27/talent-agent-christian-carino-testifies-depp-heard-trial
4/28/2022,"The Premier League says it acknowledges players of South Asian heritage are “significantly underrepresented” in English football, as it looks to bring an end to decades of lost talent. A new initiative known as the South Asian Action Plan, created by the Premier League in conjunction with Kick it Out, aims to better identify talent among boys of South Asian heritage at “foundation phase” age, between eight and 12 years old, and increase the numbers of players within the academy system. “We have an accurate record of the ethnic make‑up of our young players and we absolutely see that boys of South Asian heritage are significantly underrepresented,” the Premier League’s director of football, Neil Saunders, said. “We feel that that shouldn’t be the case and we’re committed to addressing that. We recognise it isn’t going to happen overnight but we’re committed to a long-term plan.” The scheme, launched this week at a gathering in Birmingham of 100 coaches and officials from 35 clubs across England, is to aim for long‑term improvement in the number of players of South Asian heritage in the professional and non-league game, hoping to echo the development of English youth talent more broadly under the Elite Player Performance Plan (EPPP). Saunders was instrumental in the success of the EPPP, which has developed a generation of English talent – from Reece James to Phil Foden – who compete at the very top. Players of South Asian heritage have not benefited from this change, with only 16 players active in the English professional game. Work by individuals across the country, including Riz Rehman of the Professional Footballers’ Association whose Asian Inclusion Mentoring Scheme built a network for aspiring professionals, has initiated change which Saunders believes the Premier League can accelerate. “There’s lots of good work already taking place and it’s about how we capture some of that and work with others to complement it,” Saunders said. “We feel there’s a really important role we can play to accelerate this change and to be really explicit to Asian communities that football is for you and our academies are for you. “We know through the data that young Asian boys, and we’re talking about boys in this instance, love football. They’re playing football at grassroots level, they’re watching the Premier League and this hopefully is an explicit statement about our commitment to embracing them and providing them with better pathways to thrive in our environment.” The chair of Kick it Out, Sanjay Bhandari, said the scheme marked “acceptance” that action was needed. “We can’t change what happened yesterday; all we can do is focus on what we can do now,” he said. “It’s a bit like a 12-step recovery programme: the first step is acceptance. People and clubs signing up to say we understand that there’s a challenge, but also an opportunity here, because they are flipsides of a coin.” The Premier League is to work with academies to better engage young prospects and two talent ID events will take place in Leicester and London in May and June. Further training and recruitment of coaches will also take place, but benchmarks are not being set to judge the success of the scheme. Bhandari said the time was not right for hard targets. “I worked on the football leadership diversity code [launched by the FA 18 months ago] and it was about setting targets because the time was right for them. We need to get a different level of engagement here first and get people on that journey.”",Sport/Football,Premier League launches scheme to identify players of South Asian heritage,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/28/premier-league-launches-scheme-to-identify-players-of-south-asian-heritage
4/28/2022,"The remains of a huge sea creature with enormous teeth that could have helped it capture giant squid have been found in the Swiss Alps. Ichthyosaurs were large marine reptiles with an elongated, snakey shape. They first emerged after the end of the Permian extinction, an event also known as the “great dying”, which occurred about 250m years ago and which wiped out more than two-thirds of species on land and 96% of marine species. The toothy beast is one of three giant ichthyosaurs discovered in the Swiss Alps and is thought to have lived during the late Triassic period, about 205m years ago – potentially making them some of the last such behemoths. The team said the findings helped resolve the conundrum of whether giant ichthyosaurs, like some smaller species of the creatures, had teeth. Prof Martin Sander, of the University of Bonn, a co-author of the study, said: “It’s all very, very scanty evidence. We have these ghosts swimming in the late Triassic oceans for tens of millions of years, and we don’t know what they look like. It’s an embarrassment for palaeontology. “For a while we thought they had teeth. Then we thought, well, we never find any teeth. Now we have the tooth of a giant and a giant tooth. So some of them have teeth.” Writing in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology the team describe how they discovered fossils from three giant ichthyosaurs at different sites in the Kössen Formation between 1976 and 1990. A fossil from one of the beasts was an incomplete tooth 10cm in length. The team found an enormous vertebra and rib fragments relating to another. The fossils of the third included seven large vertebrae. Sander said none of the remains appeared to be of known species of ichthyosaur. The team say the tooth, which lacks most of its crown, is only the second to have come from a giant ichthyosaur and is the largest ever found for such a creature, surpassing those of a species known as Himalayasaurus, which was discovered in China and is thought to have had a body length of about 15 metres. “Ichthyosaurs have a very characteristic tooth structure that’s visible in the root and also in the crown,” said Sander, adding that the toothy giant discovered in the Alps probably would have eaten smaller ichthyosaurs and giant squid. Sander said one of the creatures appeared to have been about the same size as Himalayasaurus, while the other two, including the toothy beast, were probably similar in size to the giant ichthyosaur Shastasaurus, a creature found previously in British Columbia and that was about 21 metres long – around two doubledecker bus lengths. “That skeleton had vertebrae that are the same diameter as the ones from the Alps,” said Sander. But they are not the largest ichthyosaurs known to have lived. Among other finds, a toothless jawbone discovered in the Bristol channel is thought to have belonged to an ichthyosaur that was about 26 metres long. While ichthyosaurs roamed around the oceans, the newly reported remains were laid down in what was once a lagoon, suggesting the beasts went into shallow waters. “It’s kind of the same problem when you get a sperm whale in the North Sea,” said Sander. Dr Ben Moon, a palaeontologist at the University of Bristol who was not involved in the work, said it was possible the creatures might have entered shallow waters to mate or give birth. He said the new report was exciting as there were few fossils of giant ichthyosaurs. Dr Nick Fraser, a palaeontologist at National Museums Scotland, said it was difficult to determine the size of a giant ichthyosaur based on a tooth alonebut that the finds shed new light on the reptiles. “Until now we have suspected that most of the largest ichthyosaurs were toothless and were suction feeders,” he said, adding that the size of the newly reported tooth was stunning. “The owner of this tooth was not to be messed with,” said Fraser. “Along with remains of vertebrae and ribs, here is really concrete evidence that, in the past, Triassic waters sheltered some truly massive ocean-going reptiles, possibly as large as the living blue whale, and some likely had huge jaws armed with robust teeth.”",News/Science,Giant ichthyosaur’s huge tooth points to sea creatures with robust bite,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/28/giant-ichthyosaurs-huge-tooth-points-to-sea-creatures-with-robust-bite
4/28/2022,"Jürgen Klopp said Liverpool must remain “completely alert” to the threat posed by Villarreal despite dominating Unai Emery’s team throughout the Champions League semi-final first leg at Anfield. Villarreal had one shot in the entire game, none on target, as Liverpool controlled the tie and established a 2-0 lead through a Pervis Estupiñán own goal plus Sadio Mané’s 20th goal of the season. The Spanish side’s attempt was the joint-lowest number in a Champions League semi-final since the data started being recorded in 2003-04. Liverpool also had two goals disallowed for offside but Klopp, whose team remain on course for an unprecedented quadruple, claims Villarreal will be far more dangerous on home soil next Tuesday. “It’s 2-0, half-time, no more, no less,” the Liverpool manager said. “It is a dangerous scoreline. How much work is left to do? The full work. “Nothing has happened yet. It’s 2-0 at half-time and we have to be completely on alert and 100% in the right mood. We have to play the second half like the first half, as though there is nothing to defend. “We know we go there and it will be a tricky atmosphere for us. It will be different to tonight. These players, this coach, they will fight for it with all they have. And what I like is that we also fight with it with all we have. “If they beat us with a result that takes them to the final, then they deserve it. If not, then we deserve it. That’s how the competition is. We played a really good game and now in five [six] days we play again and we have to make sure we are ready.” Klopp claimed Liverpool’s maturity was key to victory, while Emery admitted his team were not allowed to implement their counterattacking gameplan by “the favourites for the Champions League”. The Villarreal head coach said: “They were better than us over the 90 minutes. “We wanted to play a better game, create better chances for ourselves, we needed to be on the defensive a lot, we needed to be able to win the ball back and go out on the counterattack. “We have got to accept what happened tonight and be optimistic that next week we can create danger for them. I can’t wait to get that game under way. I want to prepare for it and for you to see that we can take the game to them.”",Sport/Football,"‘A dangerous score’: Liverpool’s tie with Villarreal is not over, insists Klopp",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/jurgen-klopp-insists-semi-final-not-over-despite-comfortable-liverpool-win
4/28/2022,"Van Dijk to Konaté back to Van Dijk to Thiago and in a flash Thiago’s gone and he gives it to Fabinho Fabinho to Robertson and he’s running oh God he’s running and Díaz is making the run Henderson is making the run you see Salah out of the corner of your eye but Robertson is cutting inside and there’s a big space between Juan and Pau so you close it but now Mané is free and Robertson crosses Díaz goes for it plus some other red shirt is that Mané and the ball runs out for a goal-kick and breathe you can finally breathe. Oh Christ, is that Jota getting ready to come on? This, insofar as you can even express it, is the experience of facing Liverpool at their best: football without punctuation marks or pause for thought, a dizzying stream of consciousness, a quickfire interrogation that you can barely process, let alone begin to follow. It took 16 years for Villarreal to reach their second Champions League semi-final and a little over two minutes for them to lose it. In all likelihood it may have felt even quicker than that: just a concussive blur of red streaks, the sound of triumphant songs and the taste of blood rising from your lungs, the sensation of being a long way from home and completely out of place. Unai Emery’s team did almost everything right here. They were physical, disciplined, organised and clear in their strategy. Against an ordinary team, it would probably have been good enough. And for 45 minutes here, Liverpool were pretty ordinary. But then came the cloudburst, the rumble of thunder and the flashes of lightning, a torrent that few sides on the planet are capable of living with. The talk before this game was of the need for a solid, workmanlike, professional Liverpool performance. Perhaps too much so. Even against smaller, weaker opponents Liverpool have always been at their best when infused with a certain piety, a sense of mission, a taste for magic. Only when they seemed to clock that this was a Champions League semi-final and not a Monday night game against Wolves did they manage to muster the required filth and fury, and two goals might conceivably have been more. And for all the cosmetic similarities, this was a markedly different sort of game from the Merseyside derby on Sunday. Villarreal were crabby and cautious and cynical, but they also wanted the ball. Dani Parejo, Giovani Lo Celso, Étienne Capoue: these are not midfielders who are content simply to kick it away and hope for the best. Their back four was brave enough to draw opponents towards them and dribble their way out of danger. And so Villarreal’s 26% possession was less a measure of their own ambition than of Liverpool’s remorseless pressing machine. There was a moment in the first half when Pervis Estupiñán hesitated over a throw-in and was booed by all four sides of the ground. But he wasn’t trying to waste time; he just couldn’t see a viable option amid the enclosure of red shirts. Virgil van Dijk and the increasingly impermeable Ibrahima Konaté mopped up everything at the back. And even when Villarreal did carve out a half-opening, Fabinho was there with the tackle, not just taking the ball but taking all memory of the ball, to the point where you can no longer be sure whether you ever had it. With the back door firmly locked, the only real point of interest was whether Liverpool could find a way through. And even amid the frustrations of the first half, the percentages always seemed to be on their side. The pace was simply too high, the shots raining in from all angles. The deflected cross from Jordan Henderson that gave Liverpool their first goal was simply a numerical inevitability: if you’re playing 291 passes into the final third, chances are you’re going to get a lucky break from one of them. Exactly 133 seconds later, Mohamed Salah was playing in Sadio Mané to make victory secure. And even if it took them most of the game to find their rhythm, there was a security and certainty to Liverpool here that stands in subtle contrast to many of their recent European campaigns. From Chelsea to Olympiakos, Milan in 2005 to Barcelona in 2019, so many of Liverpool’s European triumphs have been built on daring raids against the odds. Frontrunning has rarely come as easily to them, but these days Liverpool are the pacesetters, the frontrunners, the throne. The fans no longer flock to Anfield in hope but in expectation. This was another sign that Jürgen Klopp’s side are no longer bowing to that expectation, but living and thriving on it. And yes, this tie may only be half-done. But even with the benefit of home advantage, you feel that for Villarreal the memories of this waking ordeal will simply be too vivid and powerful. For all their stirring progress through this year’s competition, here they looked like exactly what they were: a small-town club in the jaws of an ungodly hurricane.",Sport/Football,No pause for thought as Villarreal run into relentless Red hurricane | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/27/no-pause-for-thought-as-villarreal-run-into-relentless-red-hurricane
4/28/2022,"Russia has nearly doubled its revenues from selling fossil fuels to the EU during the two months of war in Ukraine, benefiting from soaring prices even as volumes have been reduced. Russia has received about €62bn from exports of oil, gas and coal in the two months since the invasion began, according to an analysis of shipping movements and cargos by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. For the EU, imports were about €44bn for the past two months, compared with about €140bn for the whole of last year, or roughly €12bn a month. The findings demonstrate how Russia has continued to benefit from its stranglehold over Europe’s energy supply, even while governments have frantically sought to prevent Vladimir Putin using oil and gas as an economic weapon. Even though exports from Russia have been reduced by the war and sanctions, the country’s dominance as a source of gas has meant cutting off supplies has only increased prices, which were already high because of tight supply as global economies recovered from the Covid-19 pandemic. Crude oil shipments from Russia to foreign ports fell by 30% in the first three weeks of April, compared with rates in January and February, before the invasion, according to the CREA data. But the higher prices Russia can now command for its oil and gas mean its revenues, which flow almost directly to the Russian government through state-dominated companies, have risen even while sanctions and export restrictions bite. Russia has effectively caught the EU in a trap where further restrictions will raise prices further, cushioning its revenues despite the best efforts of EU governments. Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst for CREA, said the cash propped up Putin’s war effort, and the only way to disable his war machine was to move rapidly away from fossil fuels. “Fossil fuel exports are a key enabler of Putin’s regime, and many other rogue states,” he said. “Continued energy imports are the major gaps in the sanctions imposed on Russia. Everyone who buys these fossil fuels is complicit in the horrendous violations of international law carried out by the Russian military.” Russia in recent days has moved to cut off fossil fuel supplies to Poland and Bulgaria, which has provoked outrage. Louis J Wilson, senior adviser at campaigning group Global Witness, said Russia’s willingness to violate its own contracts meant businesses now had no excuse for continuing to trade with Russia. “Fossil fuel majors and commodity traders who have continued trading in Russian fossil fuels, claiming that they are forced to do so by their long-term contracts, should take note of the value of the agreements they hold with Russian entities. Russia is willing to tear up these contracts to support their own war effort, yet European companies supposedly feel compelled to continue financing war crimes out of respect for them,” he said. “The corporate enablers of this deadly trade have shown they will stop at nothing to continue profiting from Russia’s blood oil.” CREA’s data found that many fossil fuel companies continued to do high volumes of trade with Russia, including BP, Shell and ExxonMobil. Germany was the biggest importer in the last two months, despite repeated avowals by the government that halting dependence on Russian oil was a priority. The country paid about €9bn for imports during the period. Italy and the Netherlands were also big importers, with about €6.8bn and €5.6bn respectively, but as those countries operate major ports, which take in products for refining and use in the chemical industries as well as for domestic consumption, many of those imports were probably used elsewhere. A spokesperson for Shell told the Guardian that the company had taken decisive action in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine. “We have announced our intent to exit our joint ventures with Gazprom and related entities and to phase out all Russian hydrocarbons, in consultation with governments. Since we announced this intent, we have stopped all spot purchases of Russian crude, liquefied natural gas and of cargos of refined products directly exported from Russia.” And a spokesperson for Exxon said: “We support the internationally coordinated efforts to bring Russia’s unprovoked attack to an end, and we are complying with all sanctions. We have not made any new contracts for Russian products since the Russian invasion, and there are no deliveries of Russian crude or refined products currently scheduled for the UK. We will not invest in new developments in Russia.” “Two months after Putin invaded Ukraine, Germany is still funding the Russian war chest to the tune of €4.5bn a month. Berlin is the largest buyer of Russian fossil fuels,” Bernice Lee, a research director at the Chatham House thinktank, told the Guardian. “The world is looking to Germany to demonstrate strength and determination towards Russia, but instead they’re bankrolling the war and blocking a European embargo on Russian oil.”",News/World news,Russia doubles fossil fuel revenues since invasion of Ukraine began,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/27/russia-doubles-fossil-fuel-revenues-since-invasion-of-ukraine-began
