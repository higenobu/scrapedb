2/10/2022,"Donald Trump roiled Georgia Republicans with an endorsement in a crowded House primary Wednesday as the former president molds the political landscape in an effort to defeat the state's GOP governor. On its face, Trump's ""complete and total endorsement"" of Vernon Jones in Georgia’s 10th Congressional District looked like another case of the former president rewarding “an 'America First' fighter.” Jones, a former Democrat and former state legislator, spoke at the 2020 Republican National Convention officially nominating Trump. But Jones earned his endorsement in another way, as well: Two days earlier, he dropped out of Georgia's high-stakes GOP race for governor — making it easier for Trump’s preferred candidate, former Sen. David Perdue, to beat Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in a one-on-one primary matchup. For months, advisers in Trump’s orbit privately tried to nudge Jones to leave the gubernatorial race after Trump recruited Perdue in December to run against Kemp, who earned Trump’s enmity because he refused to help overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia, which helped seal Joe Biden’s presidential win. Jones' decision to switch races capped on-and-off discussions with Trump advisers and allies who described the discussions as friendly, according to three Republicans with knowledge of the talks. But Jones was already running — and siphoning pro-Trump, anti-Kemp votes from Perdue, according to polls that showed him with little traction statewide. Trump needed him to leave the race, which Jones did Monday while simultaneously announcing his bid for Congress. Jones endorsed Perdue, who in turn called Jones a ""conservative patriot."" The race for the seat being vacated by Republican Rep. Jody Hice, who is challenging Republican and Trump foe Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, already featured 11 candidates before Jones jumped in. Most were running as Trump Republicans in the heavily conservative district in eastern Georgia. “Georgia 10 was a deep and chaotic primary before Vernon Jones’ entry. And now it’s completely off the rails,” Chip Lake, a Republican strategist in Georgia, said. “I don’t have a crystal ball to know what will happen. But I know there’s gonna be a lot more eyeballs on this congressional primary than before.” Few political observers had expected Jones to win the gubernatorial contest because he raised little money, didn’t have Trump’s endorsement and had a controversial past as a lawmaker that could prove problematic in a primary. Jones’ critics shared an extensive opposition-research file with Trump’s team behind the scenes, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. With Trump’s coveted endorsement in hand, Lake said, Jones is “going to have an opportunity to at least compete” in the House race. Robert Cahaly, a Georgia-based pollster with the Trafalgar Group, agreed with Lake’s assessment and pointed to a recent poll he took of the 10th Congressional District that showed 41 percent of Republican voters would be more likely to support a candidate endorsed by Trump. ""Any Trump endorsement is probably going to put the person he endorses — in this case Vernon Jones — into first or second place,"" Cahaly said. ""It’s that powerful."" The poll suggested that one of Jones’ 11 Republican opponents, Mike Collins, was the early front-runner, pulling more than a third of the vote, three times more than the second-place candidate. But that poll was taken before Jones made his announcement and secured Trump’s endorsement, Cahaly told NBC News. Jones’ opponents appeared to understand the stakes. The day before Trump’s endorsement, Collins unleashed a website full of opposition research called realvernonjones.com and unloaded on him in a brutal online ad that called Jones “a conman, a carpetbagger and a Democrat with a rap sheet.” If no candidate can get more than 50 percent of the vote in Georgia, the top two vote-getters have a runoff race. The state also has open primaries, which could allow Democrats and independents to vote in GOP primaries. That combination of factors, Cahaly said, probably won’t affect the congressional race because the district is so heavily Republican, but it could have had major implications in the May 24 gubernatorial primary if Jones had stayed in the race and forced a Kemp-Perdue runoff. One Trump adviser, who was not authorized to speak about strategy on the record, said they were still bracing for the race to go to a runoff, but Jones’ absence could make it easier for Perdue to lead Kemp in the initial round of votes, giving him momentum. Compared to Kemp, Perdue posted relatively lackluster fundraising numbers prior to Jones’ decision to leave the race. The Republican Governors Association announced Wednesday it would officially back Kemp, which could further his financial advantage. In the 10th Congressional District, Jasper County GOP Chair Mary Patrick said she couldn’t figure out why Trump was getting involved in the primary, aside from the gubernatorial race. She said a group of party chairmen from the district emailed each other over the weekend and said they didn’t see much support for Jones. “There was no sense that this was a good thing,” Patrick said of Jones’ congressional candidacy.",Politics/NBC News,'Completely off the rails': Trump's latest endorsement roils Georgia's GOP,https://news.yahoo.com/completely-off-rails-trumps-latest-004743434.html
2/10/2022,"James Brickwood/getty Bob Saget's family confirmed on Wednesday that the actor's death last month at the age of 65 was due to head trauma. In their statement, the Saget family said that authorities ""have concluded that he accidentally hit the back of his head on something, thought nothing of it and went to sleep. No drugs or alcohol were involved."" In light of the development, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health, tells PEOPLE why it's so important to remain vigilant after a head injury. ""When you hit your head, you could have bleeding in different ways,"" says Wen, who did not treat Saget. ""An epidural hematoma is a type of brain injury. You can also have a subdural hematoma, another possibility as well."" RELATED: Bob Saget's Family Is 'Devastated' About Full House Actor's Death: 'He Was Everything to Us' Actress Natasha Richardson died of an epidural hematoma in 2009 at the age of 45, after a ski accident in Mont Tremblant, Canada. ""A subdural hematoma is a very common hematoma. Both of these are when veins are ripped from a head injury, that causes pooled blood to put pressure on the brain,"" Wen explains. While Saget's family confirmed the Full House star died of head trauma, it's important to note that an autopsy report was not released, and that Dr. Wen does not know exactly what happened nor the exact nature of his head injury. It is also unclear when or how Saget hit his head, and whether or not he experienced any disorientation before going to sleep. Nonetheless, Wen notes that there are some important steps you can take if you think you've hit your head badly. ""If you have a substantial head injury, tell someone,"" she says. ""Call your doctor if you're particularly worried, but you should at least tell someone, and don't be alone. That way, somebody can help to monitor you and make sure that you're OK."" RELATED VIDEO: John Stamos Says 'Mornings Are Hard' as He Grieves Bob Saget: 'I Miss Getting a Text from Him' Wen also says certain individuals should be extra careful. ""I would err on the side of caution, especially if you are someone at higher risk. For example, if you are on any kind of blood thinners,"" she says. ""Also if you are older, you also have a higher risk of bleeding in the brain."" Joshua Marcus, MD, Neurosurgery, Nuvance Health, agrees. ""Patients who are on blood thinners or antiplatelet medication — any type of blood thinner — are high-risk patients who really need to be pretty vigilant any time they hit their head, and really seek medical attention. We're more aggressive with getting CAT scans for those patients than we would be for younger patients, which is where it's more rare to have catastrophic [head injuries]."" Marcus, who also did not treat or examine Saget, notes that there are steps you can take even when you are alone after hitting your head. ""There are certain symptoms that you want to look out for immediately following hitting your head. Anytime you lose consciousness, of course, even if it is very brief, or you're amnestic to (don't remember) the event,"" he tells PEOPLE, adding that it's important to look out for ""any type of confusion."" RELATED: Natasha Richardson Her Tragic Accident He also says to pay attention to ""any associated nausea, vomiting — those are obviously very concerning symptoms."" ""If you develop any sort of weakness or numbness or a seizure-like activity, those are obviously signs to immediately seek medical attention and go to an emergency room,"" Marcus adds. ""You shouldn't have any motor weakness, shouldn't have real confusion, shouldn't have language trouble."" If your symptoms are progressing, he says, they ""really need to be seen by a doctor.""

Extrapolating from studies on concussed athletes, the doctor recommends to stay awake for 2 to 3 hours after the head injury to make sure none of these symptoms present themselves, noting that athletes with concussions are urged to ""keep themselves awake"" and be monitored for ""about three hours"" after injury. ""Within an hour or two, presumably, a bad head injury could progress,"" he says. ""And that's what you're trying to look out for. [After that] timeframe, I don't think there's a significant significant risk that something worse is going to happen."" The manner in which the head injury occurs is also quite important, he notes. ""If it's what we call a low mechanism of injury — not a high-speed car accident, or a bike accident or a ski accident, but rather a fall from standing — [and] there's no loss of consciousness, there's no surrounding symptoms, then I don't think we're as vigilant about keeping [to wake] patients up overnight. But they should ideally be monitored by somebody else."" RELATED: French Actor, Moon Knight Star Gaspard Ulliel Dead at 37 Following Ski Accident: Report Marcus also says not to overreact every time you bump your head. ""I think in the setting of hitting your head, it's still pretty rare to have a severe head bleed from a head trauma,"" he says. ""So I don't think everyone should be terrified that any minor hit on your head is going to be catastrophic or fatal."" He says that if head pain lingers for weeks after bumping it, but no other symptoms occur — and the pain doesn't develop or become worse over time, which he calls ""crescendo"" symptoms — then it's most likely nothing to worry about. ""Symptoms can linger for weeks, sometimes even longer,"" he says. ""Ongoing symptoms are not necessarily super concerning beyond the first few hours. But if symptoms are worsening, that's another thing to really look out for.""",Health/People,Doctors Explain What to Do — and What Not to Do — When You Hit Your Head,https://news.yahoo.com/doctors-explain-not-hit-head-061940249.html
