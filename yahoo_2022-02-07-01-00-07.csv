2/7/2022,"Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie did not hold back Sunday in his criticism of how former President Donald Trump has sought to depict the deadly Jan. 6 attack against the Capitol. ""Let's face it. Let's call it what it is. Jan. 6 was a riot that was incited by Donald Trump in an effort to intimidate Mike Pence and the Congress into doing exactly what he said in his own words last week: Overturn the election,"" Christie said on ABC's ""This Week."" .@GovChristie says Jan. 6 “was a riot that was incited by Donald Trump” in an effort to intimidate then-Vice Pres. Pence and Congress.“He wanted the election to be overturned.” https://t.co/qmLuLMVGh9 pic.twitter.com/LD8AOA7l7O — ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 6, 2022 Christie, a former GOP presidential candidate, made the comment in reaction to the back-and-forth between Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence. Trump incorrectly claims that Pence had the power to reverse the 2020 presidential contest, and the former president put his falsehoods in blunt terms in a statement last week. ""Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!"" Trump exclaimed. Christie said Sunday that Trump's statement let the truth slip: Trump lost the election to now-President Biden and was trying to cling to power. ""He actually told the truth by accident,"" the ex-governor said. ""He wanted the election to be overturned."" Trump's effort to get Pence to unconstitutionally change the election culminated on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of Congress's certification of Biden's Electoral College win. Pence, as vice president, held the mostly ceremonial position as president of the Senate, and presided over the certification. Trump, who has spun a web of false conspiracies alleging widespread voter fraud, headlined the ""Stop the Steal"" rally in Washington, where he urged his supporters to ""fight."" A mob of those supporters then assaulted the Capitol, with some of them even chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence."" More than 100 police officers were injured, and five people died in connection to the riot. More than 700 people have been arrested by authorities and charged with federal crimes related to the assault. At a recent campaign rally, Trump floated the idea of pardoning some of the Jan. 6 rioters, drawing more attention to his actions that day, which ultimately led to his second impeachment. Rebutting Trump last week, Pence defended his own actions that day. “President Trump is wrong,” Pence said in a speech. “I had no right to overturn the election.” Trump, in turn, has kept his fire on Pence. ""I was right and everyone knows it,"" he said in a statement blasting Pence’s defense. Christie, a former Trump ally and a former federal prosecutor, has had harsh words for Trump's conduct on Jan. 6, previously saying the rioters were ""driven from the top"" by Trump's rhetoric. On Sunday, Christie also backed Pence in the dispute over the election certification. ""I think that the action the vice president took on Jan. 6 spoke loudly, and I'm glad he's finally put words to it. I don't know why it took him so long, but I'm glad that he did,"" Christie said. ""Donald Trump did respond to what the vice president said, and I think it's kind of akin to a kid standing in the corner holding his breath,"" Christie added. ""It's immature, and it's beneath the office that he held.""",Politics/Yahoo News,Chris Christie rips Trump's Jan. 6 claims: 'He actually told the truth by accident',https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-trump-pence-jan-6-152703059.html
2/7/2022,"Low-cost startup airline Northern Pacific Airways recently unveiled its first Boeing 757, complete with a unique paint job. The jet was designed by Edmond Huot, who wanted to create a beautiful plane with nods to Asian and Alaskan culture. The aircraft is different from many other budget carriers that paint their planes with bold, eccentric colors. Alaska-based low-cost startup Northern Pacific Airways, which soon plans to ferry passengers between Asia and the US via Anchorage, recently unveiled its first Boeing 757 plane. The aircraft was officially debuted in San Bernardino, California, in January, and the livery was created by Edmond Huot, founder of design agency Forward Studio. Insider spoke with Huot to discuss how Northern's livery, as well as previous works, go from the first concept to the final product. He said the project took about a year, but the process begins with understanding the customer and the intended brand. ""We always start with research, pouring over every possible visual reference, whether its geography, historical, architectural, or textures,"" he said. ""Then we imagine a story or thematic narrative that is purely creative, like seeing the plane as an animal, which is actually the most fun part. Then, we blend the two together."" Huot explained that because Northern is based in Alaska, but also plans to fly to Asia, the livery needed to represent the culture and landscape of both places. He did this through colors and patterns that highlight snow, mountains, wind, and animals. Specifically, Northern's 757s are feature a dark color palette of greys and blacks, with hints of blue and green on the winglets that represent the northern lights, according to Huot. Meanwhile, he said the spiral design on the tail is intended to represent airflow and softness. ""The livery on the front of the aircraft is quite sharp, and precise, and very pointed, so I wanted the tail to mix the softness of the lines with the stronger colors,"" Huot explained. Other features of the plane include two white lines on the engine that represent the wings of a bird and ascension... ...""Northern Pacific"" and a giant ""N"" painted across the fuselage... ...""Northern Pacific"" painted on the belly of the jet... ...and a black outline around the cockpit windows. According to Huot, this was done to modernize the older 757 plane and was a nod to the Airbus A350 jet, which commonly features the ""mask"" look. Overall, Huot explained that he thought about what would make a beautiful plane, as opposed to a wacky, fun plane, which is common to low-cost carriers. While Northern does consider itself a budget airline, Huot explained that he wanted to create a design that showed the company's premium edge. Unlike other long-haul, low-cost carriers, the company's 757s will feature business class seats. Source: NYC Aviation ""I always wanted to do something that had taste, because people want to see something beautiful and eye-catching, and I also wanted it to be identifiable in the sky,"" he said. Moreover, he said one of the overarching stories for Northern's design was ""We Are All Navigators"" to represent exploration and frontiersmen navigating through life and this new business. According to Huot, Northern gave him full creativity, which is rare in his experience. He explained to Insider that airlines typically come to him looking for a specific color scheme or concept before he has started the design. However, because Northern is a startup, it was imperative that he maximized the resources given to him to create the design. ""Both the investors as well as the operators are extremely sensitive to how we go about spending time and money,"" he said. ""You've got to get it right the first time."" According to Huot, the highly subjective paint designs are ""massive dartboards"" and can be a hot topic of discussion among aviation enthusiasts. Because of this, he says he has to understand the airline's goal and business plan to nail the correct branding. He told Insider that certain colors should be avoided because they are too bold or not as aesthetically pleasing to the eye. ""Color is so subjective, but I find some perform better than others,"" he said. ""Yellow, in particular, is very ambitious because the shades can be very heavy, look mustardy, or be too bright."" Meanwhile, colors like red, blue, grey, black, and white are typically well-received by plane watchers. However, Huot explained some colors fade or degrade faster than others, so the cost to re-paint certain shades is a factor. Moreover, simple designs, which are commonly seen on global carriers, like Delta or United, do well, he said. However, he explained that low-cost carriers actually use bold, bright colors and designs as a way to make a statement and market their brand, like Hungary-based Wizz Air's pink fuselage... And Spirit Airlines' all-yellow planes. Over the years, Spirit's color choice has puzzled many people, but Huot believes it was good for the airline's brand. ""I think Spirit was probably trying to figure out how to break through,"" he said. ""Yellow is a stringent color, but it stands out. I would bet there's an entire marketing strategy around owning that color, so I think that's smart and they've done a good job with their brand.""

2/7/2022,"In New York City in 1920 - nearly two years into a deadly influenza epidemic that would claim at least 50 million lives worldwide - the new year began on a bright note. ""Best Health Report for City in 53 Years,"" boasted a headline in the New York Times on Jan. 4, 1920, after New York had survived three devastating waves of the flu virus. The nation as a whole, which would ultimately lose 675,000 people to the disease, believed that the end might finally be in sight. Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post. Within a few weeks, however, those optimistic headlines began to change. Before the end of the month, New York City would experience a surge in influenza cases. Chicago and other urban centers reported the same. Residents should prepare themselves for an ""influenza return,"" New York City health commissioner Royal Copeland warned. He predicted that the virus variant responsible for the surge would be milder and that those who had fallen ill the previous year would be immune. He was wrong, at least in part: While many places worldwide did not see a fourth wave of the great influenza pandemic, several metropolises - including New York City, Chicago and Detroit - had another deadly season in store. As the coronavirus pandemic creeps into its third year, the 1918 influenza pandemic can offer some insight into how this chapter of history might draw to a close. But an ""ending,"" when it comes to viruses such as these, is a misleading word. Eventually, experts say, the novel coronavirus is likely to transition from a deadly and disruptive pathogen to a milder, more seasonal nuisance. In the meantime, though, the country's experience a century ago suggests that we could be in for a lot more pain - especially if we let our guard down. The 1918 flu lasted far beyond 1918. Two years after it began, just as officials such as Copeland were declaring victory and cities were easing restrictions, a fourth wave hit parts of the country, bringing punishing caseloads that pushed some hospitals to the brink of collapse and left many more Americans dead. The virus did not seem so menacing when it began: The first wave in the spring of 1918 was relatively mild. But it returned with a vengeance in the fall, probably having mutated. That second wave burned through patients around the world. Street cars were converted into hearses, and priests collected bodies with horse-drawn carriages. During the second wave alone, more Americans were killed by the flu than died in the First World War, the Second World War, the Korean War and the Vietnam War combined. The flu pandemic seemed to affect young people in particular, for reasons that historians and scientists are still debating. When the first recorded cases arrived, World War I was raging, and the cramped conditions of the trenches meant that the virus could pass rapidly from soldier to soldier, and the conditions in field hospitals often hastened the spread. Other experts have suggested that people in their 20s and 30s were less likely to have prior immunity to similar flu viruses. Regardless, the virus alone lowered life expectancy in the United States by more than 12 years. As many as 10 percent of all young adults living through the time of the flu pandemic may have died of it, according to historian John M. Barry in his book ""The Great Influenza."" By the winter of 1919-1920, Americans were weary of the limitations on daily life. Nearly all of the public health restrictions - such as mask-wearing, social distancing and the closure of schools and churches - had been lifted. A hasty return to public gatherings led to an increase in case numbers. Politicians either blamed people's carelessness for the re-emergence of the virus or downplayed the seriousness of it. The fourth wave was not front-page news in the way that prior spikes had been. The coverage was often relegated to small paragraphs deep inside newspapers, reporting thousands of new cases on a weekly or even daily basis. By February 1920, there was an epidemic in a state prison in New Jersey, and some courts were forced to halt proceedings because of illness. One physician wrote a letter to the editor in the New York Times in the winter of 1920, begging people to avoid ""needless exposure to influenza"" through unnecessary social contact. The doctor warned that anyone who visited someone who was ill was then ""capable of spreading the disease to any number of others who might have escaped, thereby putting an extra drain upon the already overburdened hospitals, nurses, and doctors."" But if the fourth wave failed to generate the kinds of headlines and fear of its predecessors, it wasn't for a lack of lethality. In New York City, more people died in the period from December 1919 to April 1920 than in the first and third waves, according to a research paper on influenza mortality in the city. Detroit, St. Louis and Minneapolis also experienced significant fourth waves, and severe ""excess mortality"" was reported in many counties in Michigan because of the flu. Local governments' public health interventions actually may have contributed to the fourth wave by limiting the virus's spread in prior waves. Letting the virus run rampant, however, would not have been advisable either, said Wan Yang, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Columbia University and an author of the paper on New York City influenza mortality. ""More infection could also lead to more mutation, so that could generate a new virus variant that can then erode your prior immunity, so it's an interplay depending on how the virus is going to evolve, which is really unpredictable,"" Yang said. Influenza viruses and coronaviruses are genetically different, so it's not possible to make a one-to-one comparison with the 1918 pandemic. Yang noted that the novel coronavirus appears to mutate far faster than the 1918 influenza virus. Management of the current pandemic also has benefited from many scientific developments that were not available a century ago, including more-sanitary hospital conditions, better access to clean water, and - perhaps what is most notable - a vaccine. Still, we can get a glimpse into our future by looking at the past. The 1918 flu virus, after lingering in a deadly form for more than two years, eventually grew milder. Now it is ""part of every seasonal flu we have,"" said Ann Reid, the executive director of the National Center for Science Education, who helped sequence the genome of the 1918 influenza virus in the 1990s. Her research found that some genetic aspects of the 1918 virus continued to be present in new outbreaks, including pandemics in 1957 and 1968. People with immunity to the 1918 virus were therefore likely to have some protection from its genetic cousins. ""Eventually, everyone in the world will have some base level of immunity to this coronavirus, so even when it mutates into a new strain, people won't be entirely vulnerable to it,"" Reid said. The best we can hope for with the current pandemic is an evolution that is to the flu virus's. ""I think it's going to stay,"" Yang said of the novel coronavirus. ""I don't think elimination is feasible or even realistic at this point. Hopefully we can live more peacefully with this virus.""            Related Content The Brian Flores experience?
