12/11/2021,"By Mrinalika Roy (Reuters) - Most of the 43 COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant identified in the United States so far were in people who were fully vaccinated, and a third of them had received a booster dose, according to a U.S. report published on Friday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that of the 43 cases attributed to Omicron variant, 34 people had been fully vaccinated. Fourteen of them had also received a booster, although five of those cases occurred less than 14 days after the additional shot before full protection kicks in. While the numbers are very small, they add to growing concerns that current COVID-19 vaccines may offer less protection against the highly transmissible new variant. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus has been found through testing in about 22 states so far after first being identified in southern Africa and Hong Kong in late November. Among the Omicron cases, 25 were in people aged 18 to 39 and 14 had traveled internationally. Six people had previously been infected with the coronavirus. Most of them only had mild symptoms such as coughing, congestion, and fatigue, the report said, and one person was hospitalized for two days. Other symptoms reported less frequently including nausea or vomiting, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, diarrhea and loss of taste or smell. The CDC said that while many of the first reported Omicron cases appear to be mild, a lag exists between infection and more severe outcomes. Symptoms would also be expected to be milder in vaccinated persons and those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection. The first known U.S. Omicron case was identified https://reut.rs/31M6TyW on Dec 1 in a fully vaccinated person who had traveled to South Africa. The CDC said that the earliest date of symptom onset was Nov. 15 in a person with a history of international travel. The Delta variant still accounts for more than 99% of all U.S. cases. But reports from South Africa show that the Omicron variant is very transmissible. Even if most cases are mild, a highly transmissible variant could result in enough infections to overwhelm health systems, the CDC cautioned. Laboratory studies released this week suggest that the Omicron variant will blunt the protective power of two doses of Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, although a third dose https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/biontech-pfizer-say-test-shows-3-doses-vaccine-neutralise-omicron-2021-12-08 may restore that protection. The U.S. has authorized COVID-19 vaccine booster https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-fda-authorizes-pfizerbiontech-booster-16-17-year-olds-2021-12-09doses for all Americans age 16 and older.

12/11/2021,"Former Brooklyn Center Police Sgt. Mychal Johnson testified Friday in ex-cop Kim Potter's manslaughter trial. Potter is charged in the shooting death of Daunte Wright during an April traffic stop. Johnson testified that he discreetly took ammo out of a gun in Potter's holster after another officer expressed concern Potter might harm herself. Former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter's ex-supervisor said in court Friday that he'd taken a gun from Potter's holster and unloaded it because of concerns she might harm herself after shooting Daunte Wright. Potter, who is white, is on trial for charges of first- and second-degree manslaughter in the April shooting death of Wright, a Black man. Potter has pleaded not guilty to both charges, and has claimed that she intended to grab her Taser, not her gun, before she fatally shot Wright in the chest. Former Brooklyn Center Police Sgt. Mychal Johnson, who was present during the traffic stop where Potter shot Wright, testified in Potter's trial on Friday. Footage from Johnson's body camera that was played in court showed Potter collapsing to the ground after shooting Wright, saying, ""I'm going to prison."" Potter then stands up and walks to a fence a few feet away, which she leans against as she repeatedly says, ""Oh my god! What am I going to do,"" according to the footage. The footage shows Johnson approach Potter and ask the officer to hand him her gun, to which Potter responds, ""just let me kill myself Mike."" ""No, that's not happening Kim,"" Johnson responds. According to a media pool report, Potter shook and cried before burying her head in her hands as the body camera footage played in the courtroom. Johnson testified that he went on to take Potter's gun from her holster, and put his gun in its place, because of ""her mental state of not knowing what she might do."" ""I knew that her firearm was a piece of evidence at that time,"" Johnson said in court. ""So I removed her firearm and put it in my holster, and put my gun in her holster, just so that that evidence was preserved."" Another officer, Colleen Fricke, had told Johnson that she was afraid Potter might hurt herself, Johnson testified. The former sergeant's body camera footage showed Fricke ask Johnson, ""can we mute this,"" before the audio cuts out on the footage. Johnson testified that as Potter sat in the back of a squad car, he approached her and ""discreetly asked"" if he could take his firearm from her holster. ""I was able to turn away from her with my firearm, remove the magazine from it, and the one round that was in the chamber,"" without Potter seeing, Johnson told the court. Potter faces a maximum of 25 years in prison if convicted on both charges.

12/11/2021,"Prosecutors are almost done presenting their child-sex-trafficking case against Ghislaine Maxwell. Thursday was supposed to be the day the state rested its case, but it went terribly for them. The testimony of a star witness was delayed because a lawyer was sick, and FedEx records helped the defense. On Thursday, prosecutors in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial were supposed to put one of their star witnesses on the stand. Annie Farmer, one of four accusers cited in the indictment against Maxwell, was expected to close out the prosecution's case with a bang. Unlike the three accusers who've already testified, Annie wasn't planning to testify anonymously, and her story has been widely publicized. In April 1996, a then-16-year-old Farmer flew from her home in Arizona to now-dead pedophile Jeffrey Epstein's New Mexico ranch. Farmer has said in interviews that at the ranch, Maxwell directed her to take off her top and gave her a sexualized massage. According to Farmer, the trip included numerous instances of physical contact from Maxwell and Epstein that she found inappropriate. (Annie's sister, Maria Farmer, has leveled more serious allegations against Epstein and his former client Leslie Wexner, which the Victoria's Secret mogul denies, but she is not a party in Maxwell's criminal trial.) Prosecutors were expected to rest their case not long after presenting Farmer's testimony to the jury in Manhattan federal court. They also planned to call an FBI agent to testify about certain pieces of evidence in order to advance their argument that Maxwell trafficked girls to Epstein for sex, and in some cases sexually abused them herself. But Annie Farmer didn't testify Thursday, and none of that happened. Instead, US District Judge Alison Nathan, who oversees the case, adjourned the trial at 10:34 a.m. One of the attorneys involved in the case required medical attention, Nathan announced, and the jury was told to go home early. Journalists in the room noticed that Lara Pomerantz, an assistant US attorney leading the case, was absent from the prosecution's table when Nathan made the announcement. Nathan assured people in the courtroom that the medical issue wasn't COVID-related. It was a bad day for the prosecution. Rescheduling a witness isn't the end of the world, but the two hours of argument and witness testimony that Nathan squeezed in before sending the jury home went poorly for the lawyers trying to put Maxwell behind bars. Before Farmer's anticipated testimony, prosecutors called Tracy Chapell, a FedEx paralegal, who testified about Epstein's invoices. Prosecutors have accused Maxwell of trafficking girls for Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and her defense attorneys have argued that the Justice Department went after her as a proxy for Epstein, who killed himself in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on similar charges. Chapell seemed to prove the defense attorneys' point, and it was head-scratching that prosecutors presented her as a witness. Throughout the trial, prosecutors have repeatedly referenced these FedEx records. In opening statements last week, Pomerantz told jurors that the records would prove ""Epstein sent a gift to one victim when she was just 15 years old."" And in testimony on Tuesday, an accuser who went by her first name, Carolyn, said she remembers receiving Victoria's Secret lingerie in the mail while living in West Palm Beach, Florida. It stuck in her mind, she said, because the package was sent from New York, where she grew up. Prosecutors even hauled in her ex-boyfriend, Shawn, as a witness on Wednesday. He also talked about the FedEx packages. But Epstein is dead, as Maxwell's attorneys' noted. If prosecutors wanted to prove to jurors that Maxwell facilitated Epstein's sexual abuse of Carolyn through those packages, they failed to do so. Chapell testified that she dug up hundreds of pages of Epstein's FedEx invoices out of storage boxes kept in a warehouse, pursuant to subpoenas from prosecutors and Maxwell's lawyers. She reviewed some of those pages, and indicated that packages were sent from Epstein's office at 457 Madison Avenue in New York to a person named ""Carolyn"" — though partially redacted copies shown to the public showed her name was often misspelled — in West Palm Beach in late 2002. The Carolyn who testified earlier this week said Epstein began sexually abusing her that year. None of those packages were sent by Maxwell, according to the records. The records demonstrated that all the packages were sent by Epstein himself, a person named Cecilia Steen, or Sarah Kellen, another of the financier's assistants who several other Epstein accusers have also accused of misconduct. Things got worse for the prosecution when Maxwell's attorney, Christian Everdell, best known as a former prosecutor who helped bring down drug kingpin El Chapo, presented dozens more pages of FedEx records from the same time period. The records showed that Maxwell did send FedEx packages from the very same Madison Avenue office on the very same days that Epstein's other employees sent packages to Carolyn. According to the FedEx records, Maxwell sent packages to investment banker Ron Burkle, to artificial intelligence scientist Danny Hillis, and to her sister Isabelle, who was in court Thursday morning and gave Maxwell a glance when her name was read aloud. But Maxwell was not listed as a sender to Carolyn, nor ""Caroline,"" ""Cardine,"" nor any of the other possible misspellings for the West Palm Beach resident. Everdell also pointed to a package that appeared to be sent to ""Jane"" — the pseudonym for another accuser in the trial — and indicated that Epstein, not Maxwell, was listed as the sender on the package. At the end of Chapell's testimony, Everdell entered around 50 more pages of FedEx records into evidence for the jury to review. Presumably, those records don't show that Maxwell sent accusers any packages that would indicate she facilitated sexual abuse. The snafus with Annie Farmer and the FedEx records might have been easy for the jury to gloss over if prosecutors continued to pile on evidence against Maxwell. Before the trial began, they told Nathan that they would need around three weeks to present their case. On Tuesday, prosecutors told Nathan that they expected to rest by Thursday or Friday, cutting their case down by a full week. The timeline adjustment is understandable in some respects: One witness, a brother of ""Jane,"" broke court rules by talking to Jane after her own testimony, so prosecutors elected not to call him to the witness stand to corroborate parts of her story. A tight case isn't necessarily a bad thing. Focusing on the charges in the indictment against Maxwell, without diving deeply into the many rabbit holes of Epstein's high-flying life and powerful connections, can make it easier for the jury to process the most relevant evidence. But in curtailing their case prosecutors have left lingering questions for the jury. Why not indict Sarah Kellen as a co-defendant, or call her to testify? (A representative for Kellen couldn't be reached for comment, but she has denied wrongdoing in response to civil lawsuits against her over her work for Epstein.) And what's going on with Virginia Giuffre, the Epstein and Maxwell accuser whose name has come up several times in the trial? (Giuffre is involved in separate civil litigation against Maxwell that formed the basis for perjury charges against the socialite, but the jury doesn't know that.) The prosecutors in Maxwell's case, who are all much younger than her defense attorneys, also appeared to be outfoxed on another legal issue Thursday. Before Chapell's testimony began, Assistant US Attorney Andrew Rohrbach told the judge about anticipated testimony from Michael Buscemi, an FBI agent. Rohrbach wanted Buscemi to go through several handwritten message pads found in Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida, to show the jury that Carolyn often made calls there. But as Maxwell's lawyer, Jeffrey Pagliuca, pointed out, Buscemi wasn't one of the agents who got the message pads from Epstein's home. If prosecutors wanted to have a witness read through the messages, the proper procedure would have been to do it through one of Epstein's household staffers, who testified earlier in the trial. Nathan sided with Maxwell's lawyers. If prosecutors wanted to point out the details in the message pads, she said, then they'd have to wait until the end of the trial.

12/11/2021,"A man convicted of killing a northeast Iowa police officer nearly 65 years ago who later saw his death sentence commuted to life in prison died this week, Iowa corrections officials said Thursday. Warren John Nutter, 84, was the state's longest-serving inmate, Iowa Department of Corrections spokesman Nick Crawford said. He died Wednesday in a hospice room of the Iowa State Penitentiary, where he had been housed due to chronic illness. Nutter was 18 when he was sent to prison after pleading guilty to killing 52-year-old Independence police officer Harold Pearce in January 1956. A 2017 Des Moines Register story recounted that Pearce was questioning Nutter and four other teens at a sheriff's office about a gas station robbery when Nutter asked to use the restroom. Officials said he then climbed out an open window, retrieved a shotgun from a car outside and shot Pearce when the officer tried to stop the group from leaving. Nutter was captured 3½ miles away. Nutter's lawyers had argued he grew up in a broken home in Illinois and was 14 when he was sent to juvenile detention for theft and forgery. He was on parole when he shot Pearce. He was sentenced on Feb. 10, 1956, to hang, and became a household name in Iowa. Nutter was the second-youngest Iowan scheduled to hang, and death penalty opponents seized on his case and drew national attention to it. The Register described Nutter as a “string-bean type with green eyes and a pleasant smile” with a tattoo of an old girlfriend’s name, ""Lynn,"" on his right arm and a “death’s head tattoo” on his right. He bragged about reading 200 books in the previous year and of offering to give blood for those who needed transfusions. He said he wished for his whole life to live over. In 1957, Gov. Herschel Loveless commuted his death sentence and said “the final judgment rests with a much higher authority than myself.” It would be more than six decades before Pearce's daughter Barbara told her story to the Register in 2017. She has since died. From 2017: For 62 years, the daughter of a murdered Iowa cop has kept her silence. Now, she wants her father's story told.
