5/19/2022,"The scary arm of inflation has found its way to the financials of consistently top performing Target. Target reported a wide first quarter earnings miss on Wednesday as cost increases in areas such as freight and inventory surged, not unlike what rival Walmart shared on Tuesday. The profit shortfall marked the first miss for Target versus analyst estimates since the third quarter of 2018, according to Bloomberg data. ""We never expected the kind of cost increases in freight and transportation that we're seeing right now,"" Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told Yahoo Finance. Target stock plunged on the news. Target estimates it may see an additional $1 billion in freight and transportation costs this year tied to near record high fuel and diesel prices. Also similar to Walmart, Target slashed its full year operating profit outlook after the challenging start to the year. The company expects its full year operating margin will be in a range around 6%. Previously, Target was looking for an operating margin of 8% or higher. Here's how Target performed compared to Wall Street estimates: Net Sales: $25.17 billion vs. $24.47 billion Comparable Sales: +3.3% vs. +1.17% Gross Margin: 25.7% vs. 29% Operating Margin: 5.3% vs. 8.13% Diluted EPS: $2.19 vs. $3.07 On a more positive note, Target's first quarter comparable sales rose 3.3% on the back of a 3.9% increase in customer traffic. Online comparable sales gained 3.2%. The company reiterated that it continues to expect low-to-mid single digit percentage sales growth. This post was updated with Target price action.

5/19/2022,"By Krystal Hu (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX is poised to become the most valuable U.S. startup as its valuation rose to over $125 billion in an ongoing share sale in the secondary market, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The shares, which are marketed at about $72, jumped in valuation from last October, when SpaceX's shares were sold at $56 apiece after a 10-1 split and valued the rocket company at $100 billion. No new shares have been issued in the secondary offering, but the company indicated to investors that they may do so later this year, said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified. The share sale could value SpaceX at over $125 billion, surpassing fintech giant Stripe, which was valued at $115 billion in a secondary sale.It could not be learned how many shares have been made available for sale by the company. It is common for highly valued private companies to offer shares in the secondary market to introduce liquidity for early investors and employees. Reuters could not determine if Chief Executive Elon Musk, who owns 44% of the SpaceX and signed a $44 billion deal to acquire Twitter Inc, are among the sellers. Musk is also the chief executive of Tesla Inc. SpaceX did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. The New York Post first reported on the private placement on Monday. In the capital-intensive business, SpaceX has raised $337.4 million in December and $1.16 billion in equity financing last April, according to regulatory filings. The company competes with former Amazon.com Chief Executive Jeff Bezos's space venture Blue Origin and billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic in the burgeoning constellation of commercial rocket ventures. SpaceX has already launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), including 19 rocket launches this year alone.
