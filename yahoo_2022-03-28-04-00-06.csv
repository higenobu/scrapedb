3/28/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) -Russian aluminium tycoon Oleg Deripaska said on Sunday that U.S. President Joe Biden's speech in Warsaw indicated that some sort of ""hellish ideological mobilisation"" was underway that may usher in a long conflict in Ukraine. Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminium giant Rusal who has previously called for peace, said his personal opinion was that the conflict in Ukraine was ""madness"" which would bring shame on generations to come. Deripaska, who has been sanctioned by the United States and Britain, did not assign explicit blame for the conflict but said both the United States and Russia had sharpened their rhetoric. Deripaska said he had hoped that the conflict could have ended weeks ago but that Biden's speech - in which the U.S. president spoke about a much broader conflict between democracy and autocracy - indicated it could last much longer. ""Now some sort of hellish ideological mobilisation is underway from all sides,"" Deripaska said on Telegram. ""That's it: these people are preparing to fight for a few years more."" ""It appears all sides are recklessly gearing for a long-term war that will have tragic consequences for the entire world."" The United States in 2018 imposed sanctions on Deripaska and other influential Russians because it said they were profiting from a Russian state engaged in ""malign activities"" around the world. The sanctions, an attempt to punish Moscow for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, were ""groundless, ridiculous and absurd"", Deripaska said at the time. Since the Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine, Deripaska has been sanctioned by Britain for his alleged ties to President Vladimir Putin. He has said it will be for the courts to decide the fate of the sanctions. Putin has said Russia's ""special military operation"" in Ukraine was necessary because the United States was using the country to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian speakers by Ukraine. Ukraine has dismissed the claims of persecution as a baseless pretext for invading.

3/28/2022,"A former Ku Klux Klan leader who qualified for office is no longer eligible to run, according to reports. Chester Doles said his affidavit to run for a commissioner of a north Georgia county was approved in early March. CBS 46 reports that the Georgia Republican Party flagged his application because of his criminal record. Doles said he is looking for a civil rights attorney to fight the decision. “If this has to be interpreted for them by the courts, then so be it,” Doles said. “They’ve caused me major damages. I have thousands of dollars in campaign signs billboards that have been pledged for [and] radio commercials.” Doles, a felon, was sentenced to four years in prison for federal weapons charges in 2003 and convicted for beating a Black man in 1993. He campaigned for a seat on the Lumpkin County Board of Commissioners in this year’s election. Georgia law allows people who have been convicted of a felony to run for office if at least 10 years have passed since they completed their sentence and their rights have been restored. They must also pay all fines and fees and avoid committing any more felonies. Doles told reporters that he had gotten his rights restored last year. Georgians must submit an application to the State Board of Pardons and Paroles for rights restoration. Doles has a copy of his stamped and signed application, dated March 8. On the same day, Doles said in a tweet he was “fully qualified as a candidate,” and “all filing fees have been filed and paid.” However, CBS 46 reports that the Georgia Republican Party found that Doles did not get his rights restored in time to qualify for the race. It is unclear if Doles filed an application or completed the process for rights restoration. His name is not among the list of Lumpkin County candidates on Georgia’s secretary of state’s website. The candidacy affidavit requires applicants to swear that they are not “knowingly” making “any false statements” or be “subject” “to criminal penalties.” Doles was once the Grand Klaliff of the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He was also a member of the Nazi political organization, National Alliance and Hammerskins, a racist skinhead gang. However, Doles said he has changed paths and “renounced racism.” In an earlier interview with CBS 46, he compared himself to Black civil rights leaders Hosea Williams and the late U.S. Rep. John Lewis. “If you look at Hosea Williams, he was on the City Council. He was arrested 168 times. Congressman John Lewis, he was arrested 68 times, so that’s not a reason to disqualify someone,” Doles said. “Don’t matter if you’re out there for the civil rights movement, then I’m a white civil rights activist then.” Doles ran his campaign on American patriotism and “anti-wokeness.”",U.S./Atlanta Black Star,Former KKK Leader Formerly Convicted of Beating Black Man Can No Longer Run for Office Thanks to the Georgia Republican Party Flagging His Application,https://news.yahoo.com/former-kkk-leader-formerly-convicted-180000679.html
3/28/2022,"LOS LUNAS, N.M. (AP) — A 24-year-old man has been convicted in the 2018 rape and strangulation killing of a 6-year-old girl who lived with her mother in a New Mexico home shared with at last seven other people. Six hours of jury deliberations ended Friday evening with the conviction of Leland Hust for criminal sexual penetration of a child under 13 and child abuse resulting in death. Another jury acquitted Hust in 2021 of first-degree murder in the death of Ariana Jade Romero but deadlocked on the other two charges. Hust faces mandatory sentences of 30 years and 18 years on the two counts. A sentencing date was not immediately set. The trial was moved from Sandoval County to Valencia County because of concerns that news coverage of the case could bias the jury against Hust.",U.S./Associated Press,Man convicted in death of 6-year-old girl in New Mexico,https://news.yahoo.com/man-convicted-death-6-old-221500727.html
