3/30/2022,"Residents of the flood-hit town of Lismore have once again been ordered to evacuate, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning the town’s levee is likely to be breached by flood waters on Wednesday morning. In a flood warning issued at 5.05am, the bureau said major flooding was likely along the Wilsons River at Lismore, with flood waters expected to peak at 10.6 metres around 8am, enough to overtop the town’s levee but still substantially below the 14.4-metre record set in February. The NSW State Emergency Service issued an evacuation order for the Lismore CBD at 3am Wednesday – its second in 24 hours - after earlier cancelling a similar order late on Tuesday afternoon as flood waters failed to reach the level feared. But relentless rain over Tuesday night saw the situation escalate. The bureau said 279mm of rain had fallen at Lismore from 9am Tuesday to 6am Wednesday. In the village of Alstonville, 370mm had fallen. There were seven evacuation orders current in northern NSW early on Wednesday, including for low-lying areas of Bellingen, Macksville, Kyogle, Coraki and Tumbulgum. Meanwhile, the Pacific Highway has been cut between Wardell and Tintenbar, while local MP Justine Elliott called for evacuation centres to be set up in Byron Bay and Ballina. 5:30AM UPDATE: I have contacted local disaster authorities advising them we urgently need evacuation centres in Byron Bay and Ballina.Apart from Lismore we also have received no SES warnings as of 5:30am. Will update everyone as soon as I have more info. #floods2022 On Tuesday evening, Lismore residents had been hopeful of avoiding a major flood after the SES cancelled the CBD evacuation order, and others for Mullumbimby and Billinudgel, around 5pm. Lismore roof tiler Leonard Gray spent Monday afternoon and Tuesday morning helping business owners move stock out of their CBD shops. “Everyone panicked yesterday afternoon and we helped them move out, people weren’t taking any second chances because they’d cleaned things out and had started putting stuff back in,” he said. But many locals were not convinced the weather system had passed when the CBD evacuation order was lifted on Tuesday. The Browns Creek Pump Station on the Wilsons River, in Lismore’s CBD, has a large digital gauge that counts down the metres until the river overtops. Anastacia Gunn and her mother-in-law, Carol Evans, came several times to read the gauge and examine the fast-flowing river for themselves, explaining they didn’t want to “just rely” on the Bureau of Meteorology. Carol’s house was inundated on 28 February. She was only given a couple of hours to evacuate in the early hours of the morning. “We look at how quickly the numbers are rising and also take into account information that’s coming in from Nimbin and Dunoon, from the locals there, who say what their rainfall’s been,” Gunn said. “That feeds into us and then we know how fast and far it’s going to rise here, so we’re not just relying on what BOM says – it’s the local knowledge.” The SES, Rural fire service, police, and defence force are all on the ground in Lismore. Armoured troop carriers cruise the streets, SES boats have crews near the river and ADF choppers are at Ballina’s airport. Carol, whose house was submerged totally submerged to the roof in February, says their presence helps reassure people. “I’m staying positive, but a lot of people are suffering mentally,” she said. Russell Scott, who has been running a free food stall at The Koori Mail’s flood recovery hub said the volunteers were fast to respond to the bad weather and pack away the hub. “I can only tell you what went on in my small world here, but, within six hours, this place was emptied thanks to the support of the volunteers, thanks basically to the angels who just arrived,” he said. “It was amazing to see it all packed up. There was no fighting, no squabbling, everybody just worked together and did everything for the good of the people.” Jan Praetz, who lives in the centre of Mullumbimby, could not sleep on Monday night as heavy rain lashed her roof. “I was so paranoid … everyone’s on edge and … my anxiety level was off the scale with all that wind and rain and not knowing if it’s going to happen again,” she said. Praetz hadn’t seen a flood in the main street or had water in her house for 50 years, until four weeks ago. “It certainly makes you question whether you should stay here or whether you should put your house up higher,” Praetz said. “I don’t feel safe and comfortable like I did.”",News/Australia news,Lismore residents ordered to evacuate homes again as flood waters threaten town,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/30/lismore-residents-ordered-to-evacuate-homes-again-as-flood-waters-threaten-town

3/30/2022,"Good morning. There will be a raft of reaction today after the federal budget was handed down late on Tuesday. You can build your own coverage here. A public memorial service for Shane Warne will be held tonight at the MCG after the cricket legend’s sudden death earlier this month – here’s how to get tickets or watch from home. Josh Frydenberg is pegging his government’s re-election chances on a budget cash splash fuelled by a “remarkable” economic rebound, with $8.6bn promised for Australian households and billions of dollars of new spending for the regions, defence and infrastructure. Tuesday’s budget includes an extra tax cut for 10 million low and middle income workers aimed at softening the blow of rising inflation. The budget papers also show climate spending is expected to fall from $2bn next financial year to $1.3bn in the three years that follow. “If we move from Frydenberg’s rhetoric to content, we discover this budget isn’t a serious plan for the future crafted by serious people in serious times. This is a plan for the next few months,” writes Katharine Murphy. Here are six graphs that reveal the sugar-hit election strategy. Russia said it would significantly cut back its military activity in northern Ukraine after “meaningful” progress at peace talks in Istanbul. Russia’s deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, said Moscow would “radically reduce military activity in the direction of Kyiv and Chernihiv”. However, western officials said they were “very wary” about Russian diplomatic promises and fear that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, could be seeking to take advantage of the situation. Negotiations between the Russian and Ukrainian delegations had not yet reached the point where it was possible to talk about a ceasefire, although there is a feeling that at the very least the war is entering a new phase. Meanwhile, a senior UN official has said they have seen videos purporting to show the abuse of prisoners of war on both sides in Ukraine. Scott Morrison has been labelled an “autocrat [and] a bully who has no moral compass” by Liberal senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells in an extraordinary attack last night in parliament. The senator – who has recently been relegated to an unwinnable spot on the Liberal party’s NSW Senate ticket – used a late-night speech in the upper house to say that Morrison was “not fit to be prime minister” and claimed he had “destroyed the Liberal party” through recent interventions in NSW branch preselections. Locals who were just getting back on their feet have again faced rising flood waters in Lismore, Mullumbimby and Tumbulgum.“Everyone panicked yesterday afternoon and we helped them move out, people weren’t taking any second chances” one residents said. “No one wanted to go back to square one.” Brisbane religious school Citipointe Christian college restricted its school counsellors from providing any support to students on matters of sexuality or gender identity last month, amid uproar about new “discriminatory” enrolment contracts. A bid to reform NSW’s out-of-home-care system is in peril after the suspension of MP Gareth Ward from parliament. The Family Is Culture bill would for the first time require magistrates to “presume” an inherent harm in removing Aboriginal children from their families, but supporters are now concerned they lack the numbers to pass the bill after Ward’s suspension. Infrastructure experts have raised questions about pre-election rail promises from both Liberal and Labor, saying the announcements from the major parties lack detail. The panel investigating the US Capitol insurrection is reportedly looking at a “possible cover-up” of White House records focusing on Donald Trump’s phone logs, which bear an unexplained gap of seven hours over the period when the violence was unfolding. Boris Johnson has not formally accepted that the law was broken despite police saying 20 fixed-penalty notices would be issued for breaches of Covid rules after allegations of lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street. Prince Andrew has prompted controversy after playing a unexpectedly prominent role escorting the Queen into a memorial service for his father, Prince Philip, in the disgraced royal’s first public appearance since settling the sexual assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre. Police in Canada have laid a new charge against a “devil priest” hiding in France amid allegations he sexually abused multiple Inuit children. As a teenager watching Iron Chef, Adam Liaw was spellbound. And now Netflix has announced the return of Iron Chef to our streaming screens later this year, much to Liaw’s excitement. “However ridiculous Iron Chef may have seemed, its influence on cooking programming has been genre-defining. It was perhaps the first instance of competitive cooking on television, rather than instructional and domestic shows … Chefs cooking dishes as entertainment was something completely new. These were dishes we were never meant to recreate. There were no instructions given or asked for. This was cooking purely as sport. Purely as art.” You may have seen Claire Hooper co-hosting The Great Australian Bake Off or appearing on Channel Ten’s The Project. But Hooper’s first love was actually the stage, where she started out crafting live shows that blended standup and theatre. Over the next fortnight, Hopper is going back to her roots with a new show, titled Tea, which she will perform as part of the Melbourne international comedy festival. It is her fondness for theatre – and the accompanying costumes – that prompts her to name a sewing machine as her most helpful possession. “Looking back on my first months of breastfeeding, I really had no idea how to breastfeed and what it meant to breastfeed, both physically and psychologically,” writes Lucille Wong. “I started breastfeeding three years ago when my first child was born. Until that point, my breasts were largely covered, cleavage controlled and nipples never shown. So I felt very exposed when every midwife in the maternity ward would come in and (wo)manhandle my breasts, jamming my nipple into my daughter’s tiny mouth.” It’s the budget that is meant to set up the Coalition to win the upcoming federal election. But will a short-sighted budget without a vision for the future in such uncertain times be enough to keep Scott Morrison prime minister? Laura Murphy-Oates discusses the details of the budget with editor Lenore Taylor, political editor Katharine Murphy, political reporter Paul Karp, columnist Greg Jericho and economics correspondent Peter Hannam for today’s Full Story.

3/30/2022,"“If I need the last rites, I’ll ask for them.” As Holby City’s final episode opens on gritty heart surgeon Jac Naylor (Rosie Marcel) speaking from her deathbed, her icily determined words might be said not just on her behalf – but on behalf of the long-running medical drama itself. Casualty’s cousin had started working its notice in June 2021, with a clear determination to hold strong until the very last moment. Rather than flatlining, it roused itself to deliver its best ever episodes in its last few months. And, instead of blowing itself up or forming a lynch mob (like El Dorado and Brookside), viewers tuned in to find Holby’s last ever televisual outing doing something far more dignified: going out gracefully. As you watch the action unfold, you see no big disaster, no bomb, no gunman on the loose – just a beautifully and subtly played goodbye. The action centres around Jac, who along with fellow Holby/Casualty badass Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) is the beating heart of the hospital – and who has rarely showed her soft side. Instead she has spent years being that classic Holby City character: a woman who is more than a wife or love interest, but a person who does her job, and does it well. Having been on a knife-edge leading up to veteran surgeon Elliot’s attempt to remove her brain tumour, we see her have a stroke after it fails – a quiet way to go, which, for a show that was never afraid to use guns, sieges and car crashes as punctuation, is all the more powerful. The finest moments come as staff gather round Jac’s bed, tearfully reminiscing about the insults she’d thrown at them over the years: “She once said I looked like a big bag of yoghurt,” “Paddington Bear with a stethoscope,” “Pound shop pearly king.” It’s the end of more than a soap. Holby was a labour-intensive serial drama that has helped along the careers of actors such as Jodie Comer, Olivia Colman and Michael Fassbender (minus his character’s spleen) – all of whom have swung through the doors over the years. Its cancellation supposedly means a less London-centric focus to BBC soaps, given that it ended due to production halting at Elstree Studios in favour of other parts of the country. Waterloo Road, which went off air in 2015, will return in Manchester and there are rumblings of two new northern soaps (a brave move, particularly given the plot powerhouses of Emmerdale and Coronation Street). The decision seems odd, given Casualty’s survival (as it’s filmed in Cardiff) – and both shows being set in a hospital in the south-west. For viewers, Holby doesn’t have a sniff of London about it. Before the show could bow out, though, there was one thing left to do: transplant Jac’s exceptionally cold heart, along with the rest of her organs. To watch is to wonder: are the writers making amends for the maligned 2013 episode that provoked complaints about its portrayal of the organ donation process? They certainly give fans one last treat: a glimpse of departed characters. Her spleen is delivered to Ric Griffin (fan favourite Hugh Quarshie) while her kidney goes to another hospital where #Berena – Serena and Bernie (Catherine Russell and Jemma Redgrave) – exchange wistful looks as they scrub in together. And as “Horrid” Henrik Hanssen insists on accompanying Jac’s liver to Leeds, fans get the chance of witnessing a romantic reunion: with sharp surgeon Russ, clearly the man he’s meant to be with. It’s a final episode that celebrates a hospital full of characters with good intentions. It gives nods to the harsh reality of food banks, ambulance waiting times and the sheer stress of working in the NHS. It’s full of warmth and a great fondness for the NHS, illustrated by Jac’s majestic closing monologue, as steely as the woman herself. “This is what the NHS means to us. Not a badge on a cabinet minister’s lapel. Not a number down the side of a bus … it’s all of us doing the best we can in impossible circumstances.” The camera pans, yet more ambulances arrive and in the background, you can almost hear Nadine Dorries shouting about defunding the BBC. Farewell Holby City, your fans will miss you.",Arts/Television & radio,‘This is what the NHS means to us’: Holby City bows out with touching finale,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/29/this-is-what-the-nhs-means-to-us-holby-city-bows-out-with-touching-finale
