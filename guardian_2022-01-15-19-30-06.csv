1/15/2022,"Hundreds of clinical psychiatrists and psychologists have warned that the police and crime bill currently reaching its final stages in parliament “will have a profound negative impact on young people’s mental health”. “We cannot think of better measures to disempower and socially isolate young people,” they say in an open letter signed by more than 350 academics and clinicians and published online.  The intervention comes as the police, crime, sentencing and courts bill reaches the final stages of its journey into law. It has been widely opposed by human rights activists, racial justice groups, former home secretaries and parliament’s joint committee on human rights, which called the proposals “oppressive and wrong”. Among the anti-protest measures in the bill are new powers for police to ban marches and demonstrations deemed “seriously disruptive”, including being too noisy; sentences of up to 51 weeks for protesters who attach themselves, or “lock on” to, another person or to an object; and sentences of up to 10 years for anyone found guilty of the “desecration” of a statue or memorial. “One result of this legislation, if passed, will be that young people face a choice between being intimidated into inaction and isolation, or possibly criminalised if they choose to act,” the letter says. “Some may deliberately choose to escalate their actions to be more disruptive and possibly violent, given the severe consequences for even minor nonviolent activity.” Signatories include Susie Orbach, psychoanalyst and author of Fat Is a Feminist Issue, Eric Taylor, the emeritus professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at King’s College London, and Mike Wang, the chair of the Association of Clinical Psychologists, who signed on behalf of his entire organisation. Orbach said young people, full of the “great hope and ennui” of adolescence, were keen to make a difference to the world. “Imagine then a bill that robs you and your friends of initiative and agency,” she said. ‘“We bring children up to act and then the government says no. This bill sews confusion. It attempts to disable engagement. It will depoliticise youth, which is maybe what is wanted, but what a tragedy personally and collectively.” The letter was drafted by Lynne Jones, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, who was awarded an OBE for her work with children in conflict zones in central Europe in the late 90s. Jones said she was inspired by an Australian environmental activist, Marco Bellemo, who called on professionals to oppose restrictions on activism. She said of the bill: “It is terrifying because it is undermining one of the pillars of our democracy, and it is also attacking the young people who most need our support. “Priti Patel has made no bones that she’s targeting eco-protesters, that means she’s targeting young people.” The Guardian has contacted the Home Office for comment.",News/UK news,Psychiatrists warn of police and crime bill’s impact on young people,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/15/psychiatrists-warn-of-police-and-bills-impact-on-young-people
1/15/2022,"One Sunday last summer, 18-year-old Eloy Cardoso left his mother’s house on the outskirts of Havana to collect an Atari game console from a friend. He’d stayed at home the previous day, while the largest anti-government demonstrations since the revolution had ripped through Cuba.  The authorities had managed to quell the protests in most of the country overnight, but not in La Güinera: unrest was still raging in the humble and normally calm neighbourhood, and Eloy walked out into a bloody brawl. Shops were smashed and looted, party supporters wielded clubs, police wrestled with youths, and one man was shot dead. Amid the tumult, Cardoso began to throw stones at the police. He was arrested a few days later, and at a closed trial earlier this week he was sentenced to seven years in prison. The trial is one of scores currently playing out across the island, as, six months after the demonstrations, Cuban courts have quietly started imposing draconian sentences on the protesters who – sometimes peacefully, sometimes less so – flooded the streets last summer. Though the state has a history of issuing stiff sentences to organised political dissidents, the punishments now being meted out are unusually severe. “They want to make an example of him,” said Cardoso’s mother, Servillia Pedroso, 35, holding back tears. Because her son is at college, police initially told her he would get a “second chance” charging him with “public disorder” and telling him he would get away with a fine. But in October, the charge was upgraded to sedition: in other words, inciting others to rebel against state authority. Since December, more 50 people in La Güinera have been sentenced for sedition, according to the civil society organisation Justicia 11J. Most are poor, young males. Justicia 11J said more than 700 people were still being detained following July’s protests, with 158 of those accused of or already sentenced for sedition. Last week one man in the eastern province of Holguín was sentenced to 30 years. Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, said detainees have faced summary proceedings without guarantees of due process or a fair trial. “Prosecutors have pushed for disproportionately long sentences against people who were arrested in the protests. In addition, many people stand accused of vague crimes that are inconsistent with international standards, such as ‘contempt’ which has been consistently used in Cuba to punish those who criticise the government,” she said. “The state is trying to send the message that there are dire consequences to rebelling against the government,” said William LeoGrande, professor of government at American University in Washington. “The fact that the government feels under and is under unprecedented threat – not just from increased US sanctions but from the pandemic and the global economic situation – makes it less willing to tolerate any type of dissidence.” Trump-era sanctions contributed to the food and medicine shortages people were protesting against. The sanctions also slowed vaccine production, aggravating a Covid surge that was sweeping through the island at the time, and contributing to the fury. But many protesters also wanted freedom from Communist rule. Economic complaints are a constant in La Güinera: it’s hard to afford shoes and medicine. A schoolbag costs 2,500 pesos – more than half a teacher’s monthly salary. “I’m sure that if it wasn’t for the economy, none of this would have happened – but the economy never improves,” said Yusniel Hernández, 36, a teacher turned taxi driver, who said a dozen friends had been incarcerated for throwing stones and assaulting police officers. Analysts say the government is using exemplary sentencing to snuff out any further protests because it is bracing for further economic hardship. As sanctions have hardened, a longstanding siege mentality among the leadership seems to have ossified in recent years. The fact that the Biden administration reversed its policy of normalisation with the island after July may be another contributing factor. But the pain from the crackdown is palpable. “None of these kids were activists, they don’t belong to any organisation,” said Migdalia Gutiérrez, 44, whose son, Brunelvil, 33, has been sentenced to 15 years. “If someone has nothing to do with politics, and you are accusing them of political stuff, then you are making them political prisoners,” she added. Her nextdoor neighbour, María Luisa Fleitas Bravo, 58, lives in poverty. The roof of her kitchen, living room and second bedroom collapsed when Hurricane Irma struck in 2017. The state provided her with the breeze-blocks she needed to rebuild, but four years later the cement still hasn’t arrived. Her rotting wood ceiling is covered with plastic sheets secured by clothes pegs, but it still leaks when it rains. Her unemployed 33-year-old son, Rolando, was sentenced to 21 years for attacking a police officer during the protests (a charge he denies). Pedroso has been running a small online campaign to free her son. But shortly after she and seven other local mothers made a video demanding justice , she received a visit from the police, who informed her that the video was being shared on Facebook for “counterrevolutionary” ends. She has since been questioned by state security, and told that if she takes to the street to protest for her son’s release, she could be charged with public disorder. Pedroso, a housewife, had applied for a job at Havana’s international airport, to work in immigration. The job was all but in the bag, she said, until she was asked about her son during a final check-up interview. That was September. She hasn’t heard back since. “Nobody who has a child accused of anything can work in the airport,” she said, before adding, with a touch of gallows humour: “In fact, yes: they can be accused of murder, but not of counterrevolution.”",News/World news,‘They want to make an example’: Cuba protesters hit with severe sentences,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/15/cuba-protesters-sentences-sedition
1/15/2022,"A new Covid-19 vaccine is being developed by Texas scientists using a decades-old conventional method that will make the production and distribution cheaper and more accessible for countries most affected by the pandemic and where new variants are likely to originate due to low inoculation rates.  The team, led by Drs Peter Hotez and Maria Bottazzi from the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine, has been developing vaccine prototypes for Sars and Mers since 2011, which they reconstructed to create the new Covid vaccine, dubbed Corbevax, or “the world’s Covid-19 vaccine”. Although more than 60 other vaccines are in development using the same technology, Bottazzi said their vaccine is unique because they do not intend to patent it, allowing anyone with the capacity to reproduce it. “Pretty much anybody that can make hepatitis B vaccines or has the capacity to produce microbial-based protein like bacteria or yeast, can replicate what we do,” Bottazzi said. Patent wars over mRNA vaccines have recently heated up. Moderna and the National Institutes of Health are in a dispute over who should get credit for specific discoveries that led to a Covid-19 vaccine which has been delivered to more than 73 million Americans. If Moderna is found to have infringed on the federal government’s patent, it could be forced to pay more than $1bn. At the same time, activists have called for Pfizer and Moderna to share the technology and knowhow for producing their vaccines, including taking the fight to the World Trade Organization. Low-income countries, which have few vaccine research and production facilities, have vaccinated just one in nine people, according to the World Health Organization. The US has fully vaccinated 67% of the population and provided a third vaccine dose to more than one-third. Corbevax’s clinical trial data has yet to be released due to resource constraints, but Texas Children’s hospital said the vaccine was over 90% effective against the original Covid-19 strain and over 80% effective against the Delta variant. The vaccine’s efficacy against the Omicron variant is currently being tested. The process to create the vaccine involves the use of yeast – the same method by which hepatitis B vaccines are produced. The Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines currently authorized in the US use different technologies, or vaccine “platforms”. Moderna and Pfizer use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. This platform introduces the immune system to Covid-19 by delivering instructions on how to produce its most recognizable feature, the spike proteins which coat its surface. This helps the immune system recognize and fight the virus later, if a person is exposed. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine introduces immune cells to the spike protein through an otherwise harmless cold virus, a technology called viral vector. The Corbevax vaccine uses a platform called recombinant protein sub-unit technology, which places an actual piece of Covid-19’s spike protein in yeast cells. The yeast cells then copy the vital protein and the protein is introduced to the immune system. “We make the protein, directly and synthetically, in the lab using the yeast system,” Bottazzi explained. “We ask the yeast to make a protein that looks just like a protein that is made by the virus. Then we immunize the protein and the body then processes this protein and presents it to the immune system. Therefore, you don’t ask your body to do any major manipulation of the coding.” Crucially, storing the Corbevax vaccine only requires standard refrigeration, unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage in transit. Biological E, an Indian pharmaceutical company accustomed to producing hepatitis B vaccines with whom Bottazzi’s team has a longstanding relationship, has already produced 150m doses of the new Corbevax vaccine and will soon be able to produce 100m doses every month. After being overlooked by government organizations for funding, Bottazzi said, the developers behind Corbevax relied on philanthropic donations to get them over the finish line. The Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development is an academic and scientific institution in nature, but Bottazzi said developing Corbevax had forced them to stretch their resources in order to gain visibility as a serious candidate for Covid vaccine development. “We ourselves are learning how to do work that is regulatory-enabling, that enables good quality, good reproduction, good record-keeping … we mimic as if we were a small biotech or manufacturing entity,” she said. “Every technology has pros and cons. Nobody is claiming one is the super-duper, only solution. All the [vaccines] are part of the solution. But when you have a situation of such gravity around the world, you don’t pick and choose a solution – you try to use all solutions,” Bottazzi said. Bottazzi said the reason she and her team did not patent the vaccine was because of her team’s shared philosophy of humanitarianism and to engage in collaboration with the wider scientific community. “We want to do good in the world. This was the right thing to do and this is what we morally had to do. We didn’t even blink. We didn’t think, ‘how can we take advantage of this?’ You see now that if more like us would have been more attuned to how the world is so inequitable and how we could have helped from the beginning so many places around the world without thinking ‘what’s going to be in it for me?’, we could have basically not even seen these variants arise.” Bottazzi hopes her move will incentivize others to follow suit and make affordable and accessible vaccines for other diseases and viruses, like hookworm. “We need to break these paradigms that it’s only driven by economic impact factors or return of economic investment. We have to look at the return in public health.”",News/US news,"Texas scientists’ new Covid-19 vaccine is cheaper, easier to make and patent-free",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/15/corbevax-covid-vaccine-texas-scientists
1/15/2022,"Early on Sunday morning, Ebrima Dukureh, 60, answered a phone call at his home in the Gambian town of Allunhari. It was his nephew, Haji Dukureh, 49, calling from New York City, to check in – as he often did. The two men caught up on news, asked after each other’s families and exchanged blessings.  “May God protect us, may God give us peace,” they prayed. When the call dropped out after a few minutes, Haji sent a voice note: “I might be delayed sending back money, but if you need anything or there is an emergency, tell me immediately, don’t wait.” It was the last time Ebrima would hear his voice. Later that night, a fire tore through the Bronx apartment block where Haji lived, killing him, his wife, Haja, and three children, as well as 13 others. Eight of the victims were children, and most of them had intimate links to families in this tiny West African country. Sunday night’s tragedy in New York has plunged communities on both sides of the Atlantic into grief and consternation. Haji had lived in New York for 17 years, and was one of many Gambians – most with roots in Allunhari and another town, Soma – who lived in the block at 333 East 181st Street. The 19-storey building had since the 1980s been a landing spot for Gambians and other West Africans seeking a better life in the US. Ebrima’s eyes were still red from tears as he reached for his phone and swiped through pictures of Haji and his family. Although they were close in age, Ebrima had become a father figure for Haji when his parents died. And in a culture where personal success also means success for the family and wider community, Haji had stayed in close contact after he emigrated. Most families in Allunhari survive on limited means, reliant on farming – and remittances from sons, daughters, husbands and wives who have left to seek their fortunes in other African countries or farther afield. Pointing to a stack of rice sacks in a store that Haji had paid for earlier this month, Ebrima said that his nephew sent money every month for food, school fees and other expenses. “He was obedient, he was always reaching out to me, helping the family,” he said. Haji earned modest wages doing “night-time work” in New York, said Ebrima, but he also sent money to extended family members and even neighbours when they held celebrations. Such payments can have an outsized impact in a country where about 48% of the population live in poverty, according to the UN. According to the Gambia’s central bank, remittances to the country are worth 20% of its GDP. The fire has stunned the people of Allunhara. There has been no official declaration of mourning, but grief from the deaths has gripped the entire town. Televisions were muted and groups of people sat in the shade in a sombre mood. Along the roadside, where pounding music normally blares from loudspeakers, welders worked in silence. “Such a thing has never happened here,” said one passerby. “Entire families perishing – when have we witnessed that?” In Soma, a few hours to the west, well-wishers streamed into the compound of the Tunkara family. Some brought food, money or gifts. Others just sat and remembered 41-year-old Fatoumata Tunkara and her 13-year-old son, Omar, who both died in the fire. Aji Mama Tunkara, 71, pulled out fraying photographs of her sister, in Soma, where she was born, and in New York, where she moved about 20 years ago. “I did not have any child and after two years our late mother gave me the responsibility to raise her. She was not only a sister but like my child,” she said. Fatoumata had also helped the family, sending monthly remittances, which helped their lives improve. “She was the pillar of the family. I spoke to her hours before she died,” said Tunkara. “But now it seems our situation will get worse.” Fatoumata, who worked two jobs in New York, did not live in the building where the blaze occurred but her childminder looked after Omar there, said Jaha Dukureh, a prominent human rights activist who was born in Soma and now lives in Atlanta. “When she went to pick him up it was very late so she decided to stay – and then the fire happened,” Dukureh said. “It’s important to highlight that she had two daughters, two sons and she was all her kids had,” she said. “The people who died aren’t people who lived a luxurious life. It’s really sad to see them living in such conditions and dying in the way that they did.” Jaha Dukureh, who campaigned to have female genital mutilation banned in her home country, said that support from the Gambian community – both in the US and abroad – has been profound. But she added that the families affected by the blaze would need much more help. Fatoumata’s daughter had set up a GoFundMe page for donations, Dukureh said, to look after her siblings, now living with a relative. “Fatoumata cared about her children, she was always smiling, always laughing. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone as gentle as she was,” Dukureh said. For many Gambians, the Bronx felt like a home away from home. “The community has everything that you need: you have the African stores, the products. You can’t step outside without speaking to your people. That’s what makes this place a place you’d want to come to. It’s also what makes this a tragedy.” In Soma and Allunhar, there were mixed feelings about whether the bodies of their relatives should be returned to the Gambia to be buried or buried in New York. “Bringing the corpses to Allunhari will be more devastating because we have never witnessed such a tragedy,” said Haji Dakureh’s aunt Aja Musa Njie. “The vacuum left behind by Haji cannot be filled by anyone.”",News/World news,Wounds of Bronx fire felt half a world away in the Gambia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/15/gambia-families-mourn-relatives-bronx-fire
1/15/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of people living in flats are facing “completely unaffordable” increases to their energy bills because their communal heating system’s supply is not protected by the government’s price cap. While households with conventional heating systems have been told they could face 50%-plus increases to gas and electricity bills when the cap is increased on 1 April, people who bought or rent apartments in one of the 17,000 blocks in the UK that rely on communal heating and hot water systems are facing fourfold increases as suppliers pass on the huge wholesale price increases unchecked.  It is thought that up to 500,000 people live in developments where at least some of the heating or hot water is provided by a centrally controlled system, usually administered by the company that manages the estate. Apartments in these developments are all supplied by a single energy supplier, and because this is classified as a commercial deal rather than domestic supply, the residents have not had bills protected by Ofgem’s price cap. Among those affected are residents of the high-profile Chips building in the New Islington area of Manchester who have seen some of their energy charges triple after the building’s energy supplier collapsed in November. Those living in the nine-storey building have control over their heating in their individual flats and how much energy they use but not over who supplies the power and what tariff they are on. All of their hot water is provided centrally from a green boiler. One resident has described finding neighbours in tears after they were all sent enormous bills on 21 December. In some cases, the bills, which are based on usage rather than estimates, have more than trebled. One owner of a two-bedroom flat saw bills rise from £80 in November to £260 for December. Others have received even higher bills, as the unit gas price has tripled, alongside rising electricity charges. “The cost of our energy has tripled overnight,” says Magdalena, an academic who lives in the block, who declined to give her surname. “The gas supplier we had previously went bust and Ofgem appointed a new supplier. As the building I live in has a community heating system we (the residents) are not allowed to change supplier. “Lots of people in the building, which is a mix of owners, rent-to-buy and tenants, simply can’t afford this sudden huge cost increase. It’s so bad that some have started looking for alternative accommodation, while others are simply not using their heating. “People are saying that they will have to move out as paying thousands of pounds for heating is just not an option. This has all been done by the management company, with the residents seemingly powerless to stop it, or even have a say … It feels incredibly unfair,” she says. Switch2 Energy, the billing service provider for the Chips scheme, and the building’s new energy supplier, Pozitive Energy, say the increases experienced by residents stem from the failure of the previous supplier, and reflect the rise in wholesale prices. Chris Wright*, who lives in the Deptford Landings complex in south-east London, which also features a communal hot water system, contacted Guardian Money to say that he and other residents on the huge site have been told that their hot water charges are about to rise by 464%. “For some families in the block who use more hot water than we do, this is going to be a big financial blow. How is it that everyone else has their bills capped but flat dwellers like us don’t?” he asks. Lisa Gregory, who runs the Birmingham-based consultancy Ginger Energy, which is a big player in the sector, says this “truly dreadful” situation is an injustice that will have serious consequences for those affected. “It is highly likely that many will struggle to pay the new costs and will then get into a debt situation,” she says. “We are about to have to tell the residents of some blocks that they will be paying four times the previous unit charge for their energy. While normal residential consumers are protected – at least for a period – through the price cap, the consumers in these blocks are fully exposed to the market changes.” She says the classification dates back to a 2012 decision made by the industry regulator Ofgem and predates the current turbulent market conditions and the price cap. “We are requesting an entire review of the price cap. It doesn’t include our residents; it doesn’t work for suppliers. The system is completely broken,” she says. In late December, the government announced that it wants Ofgem to take over as the regulator for heat networks, as they are termed. However, it looks as though it will be months if not years before this is enabled as it will require legislation. In the meantime, those living in the unregulated homes could face years of paying higher bills than if their building had a conventional heating system. This week the boss of British Gas’s parent firm warned that the problem of high energy bills could remain for a further two years. Stephen Knight, a director of Heat Trust, the national consumer protection scheme for heat networks, says legislation to protect consumers who rely on communal heating schemes is long overdue. “We welcome the government’s commitment to regulating heat networks and the news that Ofgem will have new powers to oversee the sector. In the absence of regulation, a growing number of consumers are being left unprotected. As the reliance of the country on heat networks grows, so will the scrutiny of their performance and service standards. To avoid any further delays, we need the government to commit to the legislation in May’s Queen’s speech,” he says. Ofgem said it was committed to taking over the regulation of heat networks but said the timings were outside its control. Mark Thomas, the chief executive of Communal Energy Partners, which provides energy to Deptford Landings, says suppliers have no choice to pass on the rise in wholesale costs. “I would ask the government and the regulator to help smooth out the cost to the customer through company loans, or removing green levies or VAT from bills. This would all be very welcome,” he says. “We totally understand this is a worrying time for Chips residents,” Switch2 says in a statement. “The new tariff reflects the market increases experienced over the last 12 months, which have seen the wholesale gas price increase fivefold since January 2021.” RMG, the managing agent for the Chips building, told the Manchester Evening News that it had no “involvement in the procurement or placement of utilities contracts”. Pozitive Energy said it had huge sympathy for the residents but said it inherited the contract and was therefore forced to buy gas to supply the building at the current market rate. Heat networks are considered by ministers as a proven, cost-effective way of providing reliable low-carbon heat at a fair price to consumers. The UK government has said it is working towards growing the heat networks sector, which provides roughly 2% of UK heat demand but could meet about a fifth by 2050. * Not his real name",Lifestyle/Money,Energy bills: flat dwellers face massive rise despite price cap,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/15/energy-bills-flat-dwellers-face-massive-rise-despite-price-cap
1/15/2022,"“What the American public wants is a tragedy with a happy ending,” the American critic William Dean Howells once said (at least according to Edith Wharton). Maybe it’s what we all want, now, from our dramas. Who wants to sit down to make-believe tragedy at the end of a day brimming with real tragedy? Let the Netflix show – even if it plays with tragic tropes – end on an intriguingly unresolved note. Let no stage be bestrewn, with the utter finality that we see in Hamlet, with the corpses of pretty much all its cast. (After Hamlet’s ending, no one’s going to be asking for the spin-off series, Fortinbras Rebuilds Elsinore.) The critic George Steiner declared tragedy dead in 1961, so perhaps its absence is hardly a surprise. One of his most pertinent points was how little purchase tragedy had had since the Athenians invented the form in the fifth century BCE. Tragedy, as a narrowly defined theatrical genre, had flowered at distinct moments, he argued, when both the sociopolitical and theatrical conditions were just right: on the Elizabethan stage, for instance, and in Scandinavia and Russia in the early 20th century.  Do such conditions exist now? It would seem that they do not. Tragedy involves a character’s forward motion – often from greatness to abjection (though Greek tragedy was a much more varied form than either Aristotle argued or the surviving few plays convey). What seems of particular interest in our own moment is different: a retrograde motion, in which the nature of a character is tracked back to its deep origins – as if Aeschylus’s Oresteia was played backwards, and we were first shown Orestes’s madness, and then offered its explanation by way of his family’s history of murdering each other. The “trauma plot”, it has recently been argued, has come to dominate fiction of all kinds, from Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life to Karl Ove Knausgaard’s My Struggle. And yet, tragedy does seem to be wanted and needed – in that tragedies keep being produced on our stages. In London over the past couple of years, despite the many periods of theatre closure, there has been Cush Jumbo’s triumphant Hamlet, James McArdle’s Macbeth and Ian Rickson’s production of Uncle Vanya. In the summer of 2021 – during one of the interludes when theatres opened – I saw Kae Tempest’s version of Sophocles’s Philoctetes, renamed Paradise. It’s a drama about the moral injury caused by war. But, in that moment, it also seemed to speak powerfully about physical distress and pain, and isolation, and the difficulties of a return to “normality”. “When you write a play,” playwright Zinnie Harris told me recently, “you want to give the audience an experience that rehearses what might happen to us collectively or individually. You are working with factors that are both internal and external to the character.” Greek tragedy is deeply interested in playing with the limits of human agency against a backdrop in which the gods are all powerful, vindictive and often arbitrary. Oedipus starts out respected, powerful and admired, and within the real-time course of the drama, ends up self-blinded and exiled. The knife’s edge on which he and other characters in Greek tragedy live, certainly resonates strongly with our unstable times, when, but for an accident of birth and a twist of fate, any of us might be leaving a once comfortable life to set out on an inflatable boat across a perilous sea (which is actually the premise of one of Harris’s plays, How To Hold Your Breath). Even so, Harris resists complete bleakness. It’s better, she told me, to show “how we can keep moving in the face of whatever comes”. And, as she says, this is a perfectly reasonable Greek-tragic position: Aeschylus’s Oresteia does not end with a pile-up of corpses but a new political order, and a suggestion of a way out of a violent cycle of bloodletting. There has been a recent exception to the rule of endless Hollywood uptick: the film Don’t Look Up, a climate crisis allegory about a scientists trying to warn an unheeding world about a giant comet on course to hit Earth. It is a satire, rather than a tragedy. But what it does do – spoiler alert! – is upend the conventions of the disaster movie, in that it refuses to fulfil the most important rule of the genre – that the plucky group of good guys will save the day, even against the most terrific of odds. Hollywood usually tells us that “villains reform, and crime does not pay”, as Steiner put it. Don’t Look Up tells us that the rich and wicked are the only ones with even the faintest sliver of hope. Some may find that more truthful than the usual Hollywood redemption. The problem might be, though, that “if the world is totally doomed no matter what, little or nothing is demanded of you in response”, as Rebecca Solnit wrote in Hope in the Dark. For her, “the ease of despair” is to be strongly resisted. If there’s no hope of turning the dial, there’s no point in trying to change things for the better. Perhaps the problem now is that what Harris would call the external factors that exert control over human lives – in today’s terms pandemics, climate crisis, even the algorithms produced by powerful tech companies – are too amorphous, huge and unfathomable to begin to be contained within the tragic form. The past two years have been full of human struggles and sorrows, but the pandemic itself has no obvious tragic shape – rather it is a sort of horrible, formless penumbra, “an endless Covid twilight”, as director Rupert Goold put it. Humans doing things to each other on stage (“drama” is Greek for “deed”) is starting to look inadequate to express what needs to be expressed, especially in the face of climate crisis. Human timescales and dealings – the stuff of plays – are puny compared with the immenseness of tree-time, of ecosystem time, of planetary time. And yet these are the timescales that somehow have to be considered. Maybe we want tragedy because it’s actually comforting to be told individual human actions have a meaning and a grandeur. And maybe no one’s really writing them because we don’t believe, any more, that that’s true.

1/15/2022,"The Indian biotechnology and biopharmaceutical company Biological E has produced the country’s first locally developed Covid-19 vaccine in partnership with the Texas Children’s Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine.  The Hyderabad-based company has already produced 150m doses of the vaccine, called Corbevax, and will produce 100m doses each month beginning in February. It is expected that 1bn doses will be produced by the end of 2022 – just shy of India’s nearly 1.4-billion population. The company said: “The vaccine will be effective both in scale and affordability, providing sustainable access to low- and middle-income countries.” The development of Corbevax, a recombinant protein sub-unit vaccine made by a process involving yeast and the coronavirus spike protein, was made possible because of a patentless formula shared by Texas Children’s Hospital scientists Drs Peter Hotez and . Maria Bottazzi. Founded in 1953, Biological E initially produced liver medication and blood thinners. Soon after in 1962, the company launched its Vaccines and Biologics business unit, with the mission of “transitioning from treating diseases to preventing them”. This made Biological E the first Indian private business to enter the vaccine industry. Biological E has also developed vaccines for tetanus, Japanese encephalitis and measles and rubella. Corbevax has been approved by the ministry of health and family welfare’s drugs controller general of India, the nation’s authority on drugs and vaccines licenses. In a statement, Biological E’s managing director, Mahima Datla, said:“Over the years, we have worked to make quality vaccines and pharmaceutical products accessible to families around the world. With this as our backdrop, we resolved to develop an affordable and effective Covid-19 vaccine. It has now become a reality.”",News/Society,"What is Biological E, the Indian company producing Corbevax?",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/15/biological-e-corbevax-covid-vaccine
1/15/2022,"As a professional photographer, Stephen Tayo’s usual reason to travel is for work. Since visiting Marrakech solo in 2019, however, he had been raving to friends about how much they all needed to go. Bored after a year under Covid restrictions, he eventually rallied five friends from his home town of Lagos, Nigeria, to join him on a mini road trip. The group began in Tayo’s beloved Marrakech, then decided to head to the beach to slow the pace a little.  “We hired a bus and headed for Essaouira on the coast, but stopped any time we saw something interesting. Shortly after a roadside coffee break, we saw this tree filled with goats taking shelter and resting,” Tayo says. His muses usually take human form, but he’d never seen goats in a tree before. “I thought it was spectacular,” he says. “They were so relaxed and serene. Our driver helped us ask the friendly farmer who owned them for permission to get closer. I didn’t need to disturb them – some just happened to be looking our way.” In the end, Tayo reached for his camera only a couple of times during the friends’ 10-day trip. “I was more documenting it for myself,” he says, “and a phone always seems less intimidating when I’m exploring different communities,” he says.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘We saw this tree filled with goats’: Stephen Tayo’s best phone picture,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/15/we-saw-this-tree-filled-with-goats-stephen-tayos-best-phone-picture
