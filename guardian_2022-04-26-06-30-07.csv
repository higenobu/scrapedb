4/26/2022,"If avoiding relegation is about rolling sleeves up and fighting for everything then, on this evidence, Leeds should just about make it. A second successive clean sheet on the road earned Jesse Marsch’s side a point that could prove priceless in a few weeks. It was definitely not pretty on a night when tempers were frayed on both sides, though with Palace having now moved within sight of securing their Premier League status for another season there was no reason for Patrick Vieira to complain other than perhaps a below-par performance of the referee. Sixteen days had passed since Leeds defeated Watford in their last match but Burnley’s resurgence since sacking Sean Dyche meant that this was an opportunity to avoid being dragged into a relegation battle. At least Marsch was able to name Kalvin Phillips in his starting lineup for the first time, with the England midfielder making a return from a hamstring injury sustained in December. The absence of Phillips has certainly not helped Leeds’s predicament, although Marsch’s return of 10 points from six games since taking over from Marcelo Bielsa at the end of February has eased some of the pressure. The American shared a warm embrace with Vieira before kick-off having locked horns with the Palace manager while in charge of New York Red Bulls and New York City FC respectively in MLS, although he probably didn’t mention that the last two meetings ended in 4-0 victories for Marsch. Palace seemed determined to make amends for a disappointing run of three defeats that included the FA Cup semi-final loss to Chelsea, having put seven goals without reply past Arsenal and Everton in their last two matches here. Jean-Philippe Mateta had an early sighter after racing on to a long pass but his lob over Illan Meslier lacked power, while a stretching Diego Llorente just did enough to deny the Frenchman following a teasing cross from Jordan Ayew. While the travelling supporters made their frustrations known over the decision to schedule this match on an evening when there were no trains back to Yorkshire, they had little to excite them on the pitch until Liam Cooper’s header from a Jack Harrison corner that went straight into Vicente Guaita’s arms in the 27th minute. Pitted against a potential rival for a place in England’s World Cup squad in the incessant Conor Gallagher, Phillips was one of three Leeds players to avoid being cautioned by the referee, Darren England, for fouls on Wilfried Zaha in the first half . Luke Ayling managed to escape after two fouls on the Ivory Coast forward and some of Zaha’s frustration seemed to boil over when he appeared to raise his hands towards Raphinha, although the Brazilian certainly made the most of the opportunity to throw himself to the ground and there was no punishment. In an increasingly bad-tempered game, Joachim Andersen became the first player to be shown a yellow card just before half-time as England left the pitch to a chorus of boos from the Palace fans. Palace have not conceded a first half goal at home since losing to Liverpool on 23 January but they were almost caught napping at the restart as Leeds – who had introduced Robin Koch in place of Mateusz Klich in midfield – went on the attack. Joel Ward earned himself a booking after reacting to a scything tackle from Daniel James as the evening picked up where it had left off before the break. The Welshman’s night was over soon afterwards as Marsch turned to teenager Sam Greenwood for his fourth league appearance off the bench. The 20-year-old’s first act was to inadvertently divert a shot from Harrison off target with his heel. Mateta’s effort after a driving run and low cross from Zaha was even more wayward, with Vieira subsequently turning to Michael Olise in an attempt to find the breakthrough. Palace certainly looked more likely to snatch the victory once the France Under-21 forward was introduced, with Gallagher’s appeals for a penalty against Llorente correctly turned down by VAR. The Spaniard was booked for dragging back Zaha before the Palace forward forced Meslier into a double save with his legs at the near post, while the Frenchman again stood firm when Gallagher was set up by a brilliant piece of skill by Olise to make sure Leeds earned their share of the spoils.",Sport/Football,Leeds scrap their way to precious point despite Crystal Palace’s late push,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/crystal-palace-leeds-premier-league-match-report
4/26/2022,"Owen Farrell has been heralded as one of the all-time greats by his Saracens and England teammate Jamie George, who says he cannot understand the criticism that comes the fly-half’s way. Farrell was the standout performer in Saracens’ comprehensive victory against Exeter on Sunday and seems revitalised after a prolonged spell on the sidelines as a result of two ankle operations. Indeed, Farrell was making only his fourth appearance for Saracens since October but is showing the form that escaped him for large periods of the previous campaign as well as the British & Irish Lions tour of South Africa last summer. His dip was such that his place as the England captain has been questioned and Eddie Jones has offered Farrell no guarantees of a return to the squad for the summer tour of Australia. George, however, is in no doubt about the 30-year-old’s ability and importance to Saracens, who qualified for the playoffs in their first season back in the top flight thanks to the bonus-point win against Exeter. “He is one of the best players that has ever played the game,” George said. “Some of the criticism he gets, I can never get my head around. Come down to Saracens every week and watch him play, he is the very reason why we have won as much as we have. Can you imagine playing with him? “People hear it on the ref mic or whatever but imagine being next to that when it is happening. It is incredible. Do you know how hard it is to talk whilst you are that tired? I talk a lot but there is a cessation in the game when I think: ‘I can’t do it.’ He does it for 80 minutes, non-stop, relentlessly. It is all of the stuff people don’t see.” Given England managed only two wins during the Six Nations, Farrell’s absence was keenly felt and if he continues in his current vein of form it seems inconceivable he will not tour Australia. George revealed that while England suffered in his absence, Farrell was still playing an important role at Saracens. “He turned into our head coach, he is that good,” George said. “He is so, so important to this team and he offers so much on and off the field. With his voice, with his actions, in the week the way he prepares, he shows people how it is done. I can’t speak highly enough of him. He is the best player I have worked with in every facet of the game.”",Sport/Sport,"Owen Farrell ‘one of best ever’, claims Saracens teammate Jamie George",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/25/jamie-george-heaps-praise-on-incredible-saracens-captain-owen-farrell
4/26/2022,"A convoy of trucks that had gathered outside a California lawmaker’s house over the weekend to protest her support of an abortion rights bill was forced to leave the area after crossing paths with a group of young people armed with eggs. The people’s convoy, inspired by Canadian truckers who shut down roads to protest vaccine mandates, arrived in the Bay Area last week after weeks of demonstrations in Washington DC. On Friday, about 20 drivers filled the road near the home of Buffy Wicks, a Democratic assemblymember, honking, and using bullhorns to demand she leave her home. The group was reportedly protesting legislation Wicks wrote that would end coroner investigations of stillbirths, the San Francisco Chronicle reported, and require state businesses to mandate Covid vaccines for their employees. The convoy, however, drew fierce opposition from neighbors, who told the drivers to leave the residential street, SF Gate reported. Wicks called law enforcement for protection, and the trucks dispersed when police responded to the scene. When the convoy got stuck in traffic outside an Oakland Safeway, however, a group of residents began throwing eggs at the stalled vehicles, shouting “get the fuck out of here”, according to video of the incident. Passersby partook as well, grabbing eggs and tossing them at trucks scrawled with phrases such as “Let’s go Brandon”, a coded term among Trump supporters to insult Joe Biden, as they drove by. Many of those throwing eggs at the group were kids who cheered each other on and then fled after running out of eggs. Some jumped out of their vehicles and engaged in heated confrontations with those throwing eggs. “We’re fighting for your freedoms too,” a protester yelled at the kids, the SF Gate reported. The group fled back to their base in Sacramento, complaining about their icy reception and dirty vehicles. “Bullhorns and loud trucks lend no legitimacy to baseless conspiracy theories from out of state protesters,” Erin Ivie, a spokesperson for Wicks’ office, told the Mercury News. “Wicks will not indulge any attempts to influence her legislative work through harassment and intimidation tactics – especially when it’s directed at her home and her family.”",News/US news,Beat it: trucker convoy driven out after being egged by kids in California,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/25/california-trucker-protest-egged
4/26/2022,"Carlo Ancelotti believes Real Madrid’s record of 13 European Cup wins is a “positive burden” for his players as they face Manchester City in the Champions League semi-final first leg on Tuesday night. Real last won the competition in 2018, sealing a third consecutive triumph, while Ancelotti was the head coach who guided the club to their 10th success in 2014. Although the Italian said he and his team are happy to have reached the last four, the 62-year-old manager stated success in the competition for Real is to be in the final. “I think the history that Real Madrid has in this competition counts for a lot, more for us than opponents,” Ancelotti said. “This history that has grown helps our players to feel the weight of the shirt, but it’s a positive burden and responsibility to have that. “For Real Madrid, it’s not a success to get to the semi-final, we feel it’s a success to get to the final. Normally, if Real Madrid get to the final, there is more of a possibility to win it.” Real, who have knocked out Paris Saint-Germain and the holders, Chelsea, in the past two rounds, have not played since an away win at Osasuna last Wednesday. City also played then and have done so again since – the 5-1 victory against Watford on Saturday. Ancelotti is unsure if this will aid his side, however. “It is difficult to say but I think the players in this period [of the season] are used to playing every three days,” Ancelotti said. “There’s more risk of injuries [playing every three days] but to recover from one game to another, the players are used to doing that and it will be no problem. So I don’t think we can take advantage of this.” Ancelotti is sure that City will provide a tough test at the Etihad Stadium, before the return leg at the Bernabéu next week. “We need to play well. I think the fact the away goal rule has changed, means it will be a more open tie,” he said. “We have to play for 180 minutes and in this type of game there’s a mix of happiness and joy, because you’ve managed to get so close to the final in the most important competition in the world – and that worry of playing against such a strong team. “We have had really tough games, against all the teams who were favourites in this competition and it’s gone well for us. We will fight again tomorrow.”",Sport/Football,"Real Madrid’s Champions League record is ‘positive burden’, says Carlo Ancelotti",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/25/real-madrid-champions-league-manchester-city-semi-final-carlo-ancelotti
4/26/2022,"For families of the 97 people unlawfully killed at Hillsborough it is yet another traumatic blow that the Bar Standards Board (BSB) has cleared Jonathan Goldberg QC of misconduct over his inflammatory little speeches about the disaster that he made last year. During the decades since they lost their loved ones owing to the gross negligence of South Yorkshire police families have been forced to fight relentless police lies and cover-ups about the cause of the disaster, and many legal letdowns. But contemplating Goldberg’s repetition of the original 1989 police case, that the victims, Liverpool supporters themselves, were to blame for the disaster, and the BSB’s self-important, tin-eared exoneration, it is striking how forcefully the families did succeed in establishing the truth. It is increasingly important now, given the disturbing impulse of some football fans to disrespect the 97, the incalculable human suffering, and subject Liverpool supporters to hateful chanting. Goldberg made his comments when his client Peter Metcalf, South Yorkshire police’s solicitor in 1989, was acquitted by a judge’s direction of perverting the course of public justice for advising that police officers’ accounts of the disaster be amended. Outside the court, then in a BBC radio interview, Goldberg portrayed the acquittal of Metcalf and two former police officers as a finding that there was no cover-up, and said Liverpool supporters’ behaviour on the day had been “perfectly appalling”. But Metcalf’s acquittal was based on a somewhat narrow ruling by the judge, Mr Justice William Davis, much criticised by families. Davis dismissed the prosecution mainly on the basis that Lord Justice Taylor’s official inquiry, to which the amended statements were sent, was not a course of public justice. But Davis stated that, had the Taylor inquiry been a course of public justice, Metcalf would have had “a case to answer”, in relation to four officers’ statements. These involved removing evidence that, at previous Hillsborough matches, police officers closed a tunnel leading to the Leppings Lane terrace when the central “pens” were full. At the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, Ch Supt David Duckenfield, in charge of his first match at Hillsborough, did not close off that tunnel. He had failed to manage access for 24,000 Liverpool supporters through the bottleneck, hazardous approach to just 23 Leppings Lane turnstiles, and a compacted crush built up there. At 2:52pm Duckenfield ordered a wide exit gate to be opened and allowed 2,000 people through together. Most headed down the open tunnel, and the 97 men, women and children were killed in the resulting crush. Hundreds more people suffered injuries, including brain damage from loss of oxygen. On the 33rd anniversary this year David Hughes, 17 when his father Eric, 42, died at Hillsborough, made public the damage to his mental health caused by these subsequent years of police lies, the families’ having to fight them, and the endless legal proceedings which constantly revisit and replay the horrific details. So even having to restate the truth, because somebody resurrected the lies or some football fans disgraced themselves, puts families through it yet again. Duckenfield himself, notoriously, started the lies even while the disaster was continuing, falsely saying supporters had forced the gate that he had opened. That detail was soon withdrawn but South Yorkshire police embraced the substance of that myth, denying their own failures and seeking to blame the victims. In the decades of proceedings the police case was disbelieved in the most senior arenas. Taylor rejected it in his official inquiry report of August 1989 and severely criticised the police for advancing it. Nevertheless the force tried it again at the first inquest, in 1990-91, of Dr Stefan Popper, the local Sheffield coroner. Popper decided on the day at Hillsborough, after conversations with police officers, that supporters drinking might be a factor, and he ordered blood samples to be taken and tested for alcohol – from all the victims, even the young children. That is a violation that still causes profound outrage. Popper’s inquest, and its verdict of accidental death, was a miscarriage of justice that devoured families’ lives for 21 years before they finally saw it quashed in 2012. Doing so, the Lord Chief Justice, Igor Judge, said of the police case: “Notwithstanding its falsity the tendency to blame the fans was disappointingly tenacious and it lingered on for many years.” At the new, 2014-16 inquests, under the Human Rights Act, the families had “exceptional funding” for their own lawyers for the first time and they demolished the police case. The jury determined that the 97 were unlawfully killed owing to gross negligence manslaughter by Duckenfield. The police advanced their allegations again, and officers were questioned on their statements in exhaustive detail. Video of the scenes outside was played repeatedly, showing how early people arrived, how they conducted themselves, and that congestion built up at the too-few turnstiles from 2:15pm. Asked the question directly, the jury found that the police case was not borne out by the evidence and determined that no behaviour of Liverpool supporters contributed to the disaster. It was another ordeal for the families when the same discredited allegations were nevertheless raised again at Duckenfield’s 2019 prosecution for gross negligence manslaughter, where he was acquitted. The torture of the legal system, apparently approved by the BSB, is that hard-won truths are not preserved; everything is up for grabs again in the next adversarial process. But the inquest verdict is more concrete: unlawful killing is the stated cause of death on official certificates of 97 people. Nobody has challenged it. So when Goldberg strode out of court after Metcalf’s acquittal, he might have been expected not to trample on that; to restrict his comments, if he had to make any, to Davis’s ruling. Instead he said the Liverpool fans had caused “a riot” at Hillsborough, and he repeated the falsity that the people who came through the gate crushed those who had arrived in the pens early. The terrace’s dangerous condition was such that 30 of those who died had themselves come through the exit gate. Goldberg said afterwards that he was not disrespecting the inquest, nor repeating or endorsing the police narrative as true. But the BSB cleared Goldberg on the basis that he was entitled to do that anyway, as a matter of free speech. They decided to opine on the disaster themselves, saying the BSB panel had reviewed the past proceedings and police statements and decided that “a reasonable person” acting “in good faith” could still form the view that Goldberg expressed. The BSB’s position appears to occupy a huge irony. Step out of their self-regulating bubble into a modern football stadium, where fans can now drink far more around matches than they ever did in the basic facilities of the 1980s. Some fans for whom football is a vehicle for poisonous tribalism perpetuate in toxic chants the original police lies and their dissemination by the Sun. By lending legitimacy to old, discredited accusations of misbehaviour, the BSB appears to have aligned itself with those who misbehave now. Ten more years have passed since the Lord Chief Justice said the false police case was “disappointingly tenacious”.
