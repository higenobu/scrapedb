4/28/2022,"Sneaking up to a bison in Yellowstone National Park is asking for trouble on multiple levels. It could lead to serious injury or death, for example, and it’s illegal. Thankfully, the man in the accompanying images and video link was not injured after walking to within inches of a bison on a trail, prompting a threatening response from the massive animal. (Click here to watch the video.) It’s not clear why the man would so foolishly risk his safety, but it seems as though he hoped to persuade the bison to make way for him and his wife. Photo: Sean Swetter Sean Swetter, who posted the footage to a Facebook group page entitled, “Yellowstone National Park: Invasion of the Idiots!” explained in his description: “Not joking either, his wife asked for my bear spray to get the bison away from the trail so they could get back to their car.” ALSO ON FTW OUTDOORS: Sea lions practice high dives from dock in surreal footage The top Facebook comment was from Jennifer Young: “His wife was considering spraying it with bear spray cause the human got too close? That’s harassing the wildlife. It gave him warnings and I wish it had tossed him. They should be escorted out of the park with a fine.” Reached Tuesday, Linda Veres, a Yellowstone public information specialist, did not disclose whether the park planned to take acton against the man, but said the video link had been sent to rangers. Veres also provided the following statement to FTW Outdoors: “It is illegal, as well as dangerous, to approach wildlife. Bison have injured more people in Yellowstone than any other animal. They are unpredictable and can run three times faster than humans. The animals in Yellowstone are wild and unpredictable, no matter how calm they appear to be. Bison, the largest land-dwelling mammals in North America, can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds. They can run at speeds up to 35 mph. The statement continued: “The safest view of wildlife is from inside a car. Always stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards away from all other animals, including bison and elk.” Swetter did not respond to messages asking for a more detailed description of the incident.",U.S./FTW Outdoors,Watch: Yellowstone bison has no patience for law-breaking tourist,https://news.yahoo.com/watch-yellowstone-bison-no-patience-160127580.html
4/28/2022,"The LA Times' general counsel put the county's sheriff ""on notice"" in a letter on Tuesday. The sheriff's office had announced it would investigate reporter Alene Tchekmedyian for her work. Tchekmedyian wrote about a leaked video in which a deputy was seen kneeling on an inmate's head. A lawyer for the Los Angeles Times put the county's sheriff ""on notice"" after the department announced it would be investigating a reporter who wrote an article about a deputy's use of force on an inmate. In an open letter published on the Times' website, LA Times general counsel Jeff Glasser said the investigation ""appears to be a thinly veiled attempt to intimidate"" LA Times reporter Alene Tchekmedyian ""for reporting unflattering (but entirely accurate) information about the conduct of individuals in your department and allegations of a cover-up by you and other officials."" The LA County Sheriff's Department had announced it was opening an investigation into Tchekmedyian's conduct on Tuesday, a month after she wrote about a leaked video in which a deputy was seen kneeling on an inmate's head for three minutes after he punched the deputy in the face. During a press conference Tuesday, LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the department would look into charges of conspiracy, burglary, and unauthorized use of a database against Tchekmedyian, retired LASD Commander Eli Vera, and sheriff's Inspector General Max Huntsman. Glasser said that investigating Tchekmedyian would contradict ""well-established constitutional law which bars prosecutions of news reporters for publishing information from confidential official records, including leaked videos that involve matters of public interest."" He then listed multiple court cases that involved granting journalists protection when publishing articles about confidential or intercepted information. He included a 2015 case where the LA County Sheriff's Department tried to bar the LA Times from publishing an article that proved the department had hired 280 employees with histories of misconduct. In that case, the court decided that journalists cannot be sued for publishing ""newsworthy information through routine reporting techniques"" and stated that ""ordinary news-gathering techniques 'of course, include asking persons questions, including those with confidential or restricted information.'"" Glasser said the prosecution of Tchekmedyian — or threats of prosecution — would be an abuse of power of the sheriff's department. Additionally, Glasser said, the department's attempt to prosecute Tchekmedyian would negate the federal Privacy Protection Act of 1980 that states there is a reason for legal action against law enforcement officials who wrongly target journalists. ""You are on notice that if the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department attempts to search the property or data of Ms. Tchekmedyian ... the department will have directly violated the PPA and clearly established constitutional law, and L.A. Times will seek every available remedy against you,"" Glasser said.

4/28/2022,"By Jan Wolfe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group seeking to have U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene removed from the ballot accused her of giving ""dubious"" testimony during a recent court hearing. In a court filing Wednesday, a group of Georgia voters said a text message reported by CNN two days previously casts doubt on Greene's credibility and bolsters their argument that the first-term Republican congresswoman should be disqualified from seeking reelection. Greene's lawyer, James Bopp, said in a telephone interview that the court filing dishonestly distorts a text message she sent 15 months ago. On Jan. 17, 2021, during the final days of Donald Trump's presidency, Greene texted then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to tell him some fellow Republican lawmakers had privately suggested Trump should declare martial law to remain in power. Greene said in the text message to Meadows: ""In our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law. I don't know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!"" According to the Georgia voters, the text undermines Greene's testimony during a court hearing on Friday that she could not remember whether she had ever advocated martial law as a way for Trump to stay in office. ""Greene's testimony at the hearing that she could not remember discussing martial law with anyone was already dubious,"" the court filing said. ""This text with President Trump's Chief of Staff makes her testimony even more incredible because it seems like the kind of message with the kind of recipient that a reasonable person testifying truthfully would remember."" Greene's lawyer Bopp said the congresswoman was not advocating martial law, but rather informing Meadows about conversations her colleagues were having. ""The text itself is very innocuous and inconsequential,"" he said. An administrative judge is expected to rule early next month on whether Greene should remain on the ballot. In a novel legal challenge, the voters argue that Greene violated a provision of the U.S. Constitution called the Insurrectionist Disqualification Clause by supporting an incendiary rally that preceded last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol. Greene has said disqualifying her would violate her rights and be unfair to voters.

4/28/2022,"Authorities in Michigan are searching for up to 10 men who officials say broke into a high school and fought students. As a result of the incident around 3 p.m. on Tuesday, April 26, students were not allowed on campus at Oak Park High School on Wednesday, April 27. The school is in a suburb of Detroit. Oak Park Schools Superintendent Dr. Jamii J. Hitchcock said in a letter to families that “eight to 10 unidentified adult males pushed past security and staff and forced their way into the high school building.” The men then fought with students and security personnel, according to the superintendent. Video shared on social media shows dozens of people involved in the brawl in the sprawling hallway. The school building was secured and the men fled without being taken into custody. Officials learned the incident likely stemmed from “another altercation that happened off school property over the weekend,” Hitchcock said. It’s unclear if any of the students or staff were injured. No weapons were involved in the fight, the school district said. Only one of the men had been identified as of Tuesday night, according to the superintendent. “At Oak Park Schools, violence of any kind will not be tolerated,” Hitchcock stated. “We are making every effort to identify those who trespassed on school property, entered our building and instigated violence against our students and staff. We plan to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law.” The school is planning on doing virtual learning for the remainder of the week.",U.S./Kansas City Star,"‘Eight to 10’ men push past high school security to fight teens, Michigan district says",https://news.yahoo.com/eight-10-men-push-past-161700342.html
