5/2/2022,"The “some bad apples” defence deployed by Kwasi Kwarteng in response to concerns about sexism and harassment in Westminster is a tried and tested retort to accusations of an institutional problem – but one that history tells us does not always end well. In some ways it is the most obvious response, one that seeks both to defend the institution under attack and reassure people the problem is not systemic. However, as the business secretary quickly discovered this weekend, it also runs the risk of being perceived as tone deaf and rooted in denial. The defence would be more convincing if Neil Parish watching porn in the Commons, and accusations from Conservative MPs that Angela Rayner crossed and uncrossed her legs to distract Boris Johnson, were outliers – but they are not. Almost every female MP has a story of sexism or harassment, not to mention interns and researchers whose position is even more precarious with respect to the power imbalance they face. Previous examples to have hit the headlines include the defence secretary, Michael Fallon, being forced out of office after the journalist Jane Merrick said he had tried to kiss her, and the first secretary of state, Damian Green, losing his job after admitting lying about pornography found on his parliamentary computer during a police investigation. Green’s admission came in a Cabinet Office inquiry investigating claims of inappropriate behaviour against him made by the Tory activist Kate Maltby. There was also David Cameron telling Labour’s Angela Eagle to “calm down dear”. Before Kwarteng made his remarks, it might have been instructive to recall how the same defence worked out for the then Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, when she employed it – albeit replacing “bad apple” with “bad ‘un” – on the same day that one of her officers, PC Wayne Couzens, admitted the kidnapping and rape of Sarah Everard. The murder of Everard was seen by many as an extreme manifestation of a misogynistic culture within the Met, taking in everything from individual officers’ conduct to the handling of sexual and domestic abuse claims. Dick’s authority never recovered from the fallout. Another nadir came in February when an official report revealed details of officers at Charing Cross station in central London sharing messages about hitting and raping women. The Independent Office for Police Conduct was explicit that “these incidents are not isolated or simply the behaviour of a few ‘bad apples’”. Barely a week seems to go by without another report of alleged misogyny or harassment within the Met, and Westminster can now expect similar scrutiny. It has already begun with the news that more than 50 MPs have been reported to the new independent complaints and grievance scheme. Given Dick’s example, and the threat of more revelations about misogyny and harassment in Westminster and beyond, Kwarteng’s defence may seem reckless but it also speaks to the Conservative playbook – part of the “war on woke”, framing discrimination as the work of individual “bad apples” rather than a systemic problem. The alleged architect of the war on woke, Johnson’s former chief adviser, Munira Mirza, together with the likes of the equalities minister, Kemi Badenoch, rejected the notion of institutional racism – a viewpoint enshrined in the much-criticised Sewell report. But it is not limited to race. The minister for women and equalities, Liz Truss, announced a shift in government equality priorities away from gender as well as race. While Johnson expressed outrage over the Rayner story and Parish’s behaviour, until his government is prepared to accept the existence of and tackle institutional misogyny, the risk is that they will be interpreted as empty words.",News/Politics,Kwarteng’s ‘bad apples’ claim is a rotten excuse for Westminster sexism,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/02/kwarteng-bad-apples-claim-rotten-excuse-westminster-sexism
5/2/2022,"Now England has “dental deserts”. According to the Association of Dental Groups, large areas of the country are devoid of their care. Dentists are leaving the NHS in record numbers – more than 2,000 last year alone – leaving an estimated 4 million patients having to go private, dial 999 or just suffer. Not a week passes without a bad news cloud enveloping Britain’s healthcare systems. This is partly shared with pandemic-hit services worldwide, but the British headlines seem particularly awful. The Shropshire maternity hospital horror piles on to the scandals of PPE procurement, care home Covid deaths, epilepsy drug failures and children’s mental health services being “at breaking point”. A mass survey put the UK behind Canada, Germany, France and the US in terms of access to high-quality healthcare. So many GPs are leaving or switching to part-time – 800 practices have closed since 2015 – that some areas are likely to become GP deserts as well as dental ones. To Britons, the NHS used to be a religion, evoking a loyalty akin to the medieval church. But their faith is being tested like never before. Surveys show satisfaction at an all-time low. A recent YouGov poll found almost a third of under-35s would be willing to pay for better care in the private sector, while the figure for dentistry must be higher. GPs, like dentists, are “going private” and a record numbers of patients are taking out insurance or being offered it by employers. Britain has one of the worst records for survival rates for cancer and other diseases of 18 western countries. Covid has revealed much about the NHS that had long been semi-hidden. Unlike elsewhere in Europe, relentless centralisation has stripped local authorities of any responsibility for healthcare. It has also led to ruthless privatisation. Cash has been carelessly tipped into drug companies, IT gimmicks, management consultancies, offshore privately run care homes and stupefying bureaucracy. The supposedly “nationalised” NHS is a parastatal corporation making multimillionaires out of the owners of third-party providers. This corporation is rotten at its centre and fraying at its edges. Its three pillars, hospital trusts, GP partnerships and the care sector, are uncoordinated. Politics keeps the Treasury chequebook prised open with the war cry of “free at the point of delivery”. The result is an NHS waiting list in England of 6 million patients, of whom 24,000 have been waiting more than two years. It means thousands of unnecessary deaths to serve the cause of no reform. There are many other ways of organising public health. Most are regional or local, benefiting at very least from smallness. Many are insurance-based or rely on small payments with reclaims for those in need, a mild deterrent to abuse. Look abroad and you can see better health outcomes and higher user satisfaction. Germany has three times the UK’s beds per head of population and France more than double. No other country displays the public agony and turmoil of Britain’s NHS. Britons refuse to believe they can learn from other countries. They simply assume that their NHS is the best in the world. It is not. It needs a high-speed bipartisan commission of inquiry – and urgent reform. Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist, author and BBC broadcaster",Opinion/Opinion,The NHS used to be a religion.

5/2/2022,"The director of the United Nations World Food Programme in Germany has warned that millions of tonnes of grain is stuck in Ukraine due to sea ports being blocked by Russian military action. Martin Frick said about 4.5 million tonnes of grain in containers at Ukrainian ports could not be shifted due to unsafe or occupied sea routes, some of which had been mined, as well as inaccessible ports. “None of the grain can be used right now. It is just sitting there,” Frick told the German news agency dpa. Ukraine is one of the world’s leading producers of wheat as well as being a major corn producer. About 30m tonnes of corn and about 25m tonnes of wheat were harvested in the country in 2020, according to the UN. Many countries in north Africa in particular are dependent for their basic food provision on low-cost wheat from Ukraine. “The world urgently needs these items of food from Ukraine,” Frick said. Despite the abundance of crops still available in Ukraine, the World Food Programme (WFP) said that since the start of the invasion on 24 February, it had had to provide 2.5 million Ukrainians with food support – the majority of them in Ukraine, as well as several hundred thousand in neighbouring Moldova. “Foodstuffs have to reach those in Ukraine who are trapped and in need. But at the same time there is the need to provide other parts of the world with foodstuffs they are expecting from Ukraine, in order to alleviate a global food crisis,” Frick said. Access to the ports for both incoming and outgoing goods was blocked, he said. He added that he feared food supplies were being used as a weapon in the conflict. “Hunger must not be used as a weapon, neither from a military, nor from an economic standpoint,” he said. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has responded to the food crisis by pledging Germany would step in and help where there are food shortages as a result of the war, warning of the strong possibility of a global food crisis. “This war will have consequences, consequences across the world,” he said on Sunday, addressing protesters who accused him of prolonging the war by sending weaponry into the country. “Right now we must concern ourselves with the fact that there are some people who will starve, that there are countries which will be unable to afford grain for their people and that this whole war situation could lead to a global hunger crisis.” It was last week confirmed by the German government and DB Cargo, the logistics arm of the national rail operator, that plans to enable blocked supplies of grain as well as supplies elsewhere in the country, amounting to around 20m tonnes, to leave the country via rail were being worked on. The plan, being called a “Getreidbrücke” or “grain bridge”, involves cooperation between Ukrainian Railways and the national rail operators of Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania to ensure a network of interconnected routes across Europe. “We are currently working on concrete details as to precisely how the grain bridge could be realised,” Michael Theurer, a parliamentary state secretary in the transport ministry, told the financial daily Handelsblatt. Theurer said leaving aside the logistical challenges, among the sticking points of the plan that were being hammered out by the finance, agriculture, economics and development ministry were how to finance the measures and legal questions over competition neutrality. The trains that would be sent into Ukraine would be also bringing much needed agricultural machinery, including tractors and replacement parts, to support farmers who are sowing seeds for summer crops. The operation is an extension of DB Cargo’s campaign “railbridge for relief aid” campaign, which began in March. Each train can transport 52 containers, amounting to several thousand tonnes of aid.",News/World news,"Millions of tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine, says German UN official",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/02/millions-tonnes-grain-stuck-ukraine-un-wfp-official-germany
5/2/2022,"Netflix faces the threat of an exodus of a number of hit shows as it battles to reignite subscriber growth, with almost a third of its most popular content with British viewers – from Friends and Pretty Little Liars to Paw Patrol – licensed from rivals building their own streaming services. Earlier this month, Netflix’s market value was slashed by almost $60bn as investors panicked that the decade-long streaming boom has come to an end, after the company forecast it would lose millions of subscribers in the first half of this year. Netflix invests billions of dollars annually in original content – starting with House of Cards in 2013 and extending to recent hits such as Squid Game, Ozark and Bridgerton – in a long-term strategy designed to insulate its business from the impact of Hollywood rivals pulling content they license for their own rival services. However, research shows that Netflix continues to have a significant dependency on licensed content, with major titles potentially moving off the service when contracts come up for renewal in the next few years. In the first two months of this year, 31% of the 150 most-viewed shows and films by British users belonged to Netflix’s competition, and a quarter of all viewing was to content owned by rivals with streaming services of their own, according to the research firm Digital i. “There is certainly risk for Netflix,” says Richard Broughton, an analyst at Ampere. “A significant number of its highest-performance titles are licensed from studios with in-house streaming ambitions of their own.” Friends, the most popular show among British viewers and Netflix’s biggest hit globally, has already been removed by Warner Bros Discovery in the US along with other hits such as The Big Bang Theory to drive its own HBO Max service. The One Where We Have To Say Goodbye.We’re sorry to see Friends go to Warner's streaming service at the beginning of 2020 (in The US). Thanks for the memories, gang ☕ HBO Max is yet to launch in the UK, with Warner Bros Discovery locked in a content deal with Sky until 2025 that blocks the launch of a standalone streaming service. Sky-owner Comcast has also removed big hits such as the US version of The Office to make its Peacock streaming service more attractive in the US, but it has so far decided not to launch it as a standalone streaming rival to Netflix in the UK. “The nation’s favourite American sitcoms are safe – for now,” says Ali Vahdati, chief executive of Digital i. “In the long term, Netflix will need to extricate itself from such a strong reliance on US major Hollywood studio content, or else risk high levels of churn when others launch fully in the market.” This summer, Paramount is launching Paramount+ in the UK and has almost completely removed the Star Trek franchise from Netflix, which Digital i estimates to be worth over £50m to Netflix across Europe. Popular Paramount-owned content that is still on Netflix but likely to move when deals expire include the Sonic the Hedgehog film, the SpongeBob Movie, The Wolf of Wall Street and films The Gentleman and Mother/Android. However, Netflix’s originals strategy continues to be hugely successful with shows such as Stay Close, Ozark, Inventing Anna, Cobra Kai and films including Power of the Dog, Don’t Look Up and Red Notice all major hits with subscribers globally. “We know that having fresh, new content is what helps drive new sign-ups, and this is where Netflix has much more security in its offer,” says Broughton. “Of the titles which were first released in 2021 and 2022, Netflix Originals dominate. Just 10% of the most popular shows and movies that were released since the start of 2021 were not Netflix Originals (or Exclusives). So while there is inevitably a risk if popular titles driving consumption are lost, Netflix does have a huge range of alternative options for subscribers.” Netflix hitting a subscriber wall has sent shock waves through the industry and is likely to lead to rivals reassessing how attractive, and profitable, the streaming model can be. The decision by players such as Disney+ to cut all content licensing deals to provide TV series and films exclusively to subscribers to its own service only works if Disney+ can be built to a massive scale. Netflix, which plans to focus on a “less is more” strategy of fewer but higher-quality commissions of series and films, is estimated to be spending $17bn making and licensing content this year. The cuts, which are likely to include job losses, are already being felt with Netflix reportedly axing an animated family TV series from the production company set up by Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry. Rival Disney, which owns assets including Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and the ABC TV network, is spending $33bn in 2022. Warner Bros Discovery is expected to spend $20bn. “The recent streaming slowdown is prompting a number of investors and executives to revisit prior assumptions about how large the siloed direct-to-consumer model can become,” says Broughton. “So it is not at all clear that Netflix will lose access to all major studio content in the future. I suspect a number of the majors won’t take the same purist angle adopted by Disney, and instead will take a more mercenary approach, windowing titles and licensing content to third parties where they can achieve solid rights fees.” Top 10 shows on Netflix by minutes viewed by UK subscribers Friends Stay Close Big Bang Theory Ozark Inventing Anna Afterlife The Office Peppa Pig Cobra Kai All of Us Are Dead Period: First quarter 2022 Source: Digital i ",News/Business,Netflix faces losing licensed hit shows to streaming rivals,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/02/netflix-faces-losing-licensed-hit-shows-to-streaming-rivals
5/2/2022,"EU regulators have charged Apple with breaking competition law by limiting rivals’ access to technology that is key to making contactless payments, unfairly benefiting its own Apple Pay service. The European Commission said on Monday that Apple “sets the rules” on its closed platform and expressed concern that it has been limiting access to technology called near field communication (NFC), which rivals need for tap-and-go payments to be made in stores using mobile wallets. “On a preliminary basis, we have found that Apple abused its dominant position,” said Margrethe Vestager, the commission’s executive vice-president in charge of competition policy. “Apple restricted access to key inputs that are necessary to develop and run mobile payments apps, so-called ‘mobile wallets’. Evidence on our file indicates that some developers did not go ahead with their plans as they were not able to reach iPhone users.” The commission said the Silicon Valley company’s Apple Pay service is “by far the largest NFC-based mobile wallet on the market”. “The preliminary conclusion we reached today relates to mobile payments in shops,” said Vestager. “By excluding others from the game, Apple has unfairly shielded its Apple Pay wallet from competition. If proven, this behaviour would amount to abuse of a dominant position, which is illegal under our rules.” The commission has issued a statement of objections, detailing the grounds on which it believes the company “may have illegally distorted competition in the market for mobile wallets on Apple devices”, and giving the $2.5tn (£2tn) firm an opportunity to respond. Apple could face fines worth up to 10% of its global revenues, which totalled $365bn in 2021, if the charges are upheld. “We designed Apple Pay to provide an easy and secure way for users to digitally present their existing payment cards and for banks and other financial institutions to offer contactless payments for their customers,” said a spokesperson for the company. “Apple Pay is only one of many options available to European consumers for making payments, and has ensured equal access to NFC while setting industry-leading standards for privacy and security. We will continue to engage with the commission to ensure European consumers have access to the payment option of their choice in a safe and secure environment.” European regulators are also investigating Apple over how it may be disadvantaging rivals by taking up to a 30% fee on purchases and subscriptions made through its App Store, which it found ultimately resulted in higher prices for consumers, following a complaint lodged by the music streaming service Spotify in 2019.",News/Technology,EU claims Apple breaking competition law over contactless payments,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/02/apple-pay-contactless-payments-eu-competition-law
5/2/2022,"People should be given the right to turn road verges, sterile lawns around hospitals and underused public spaces into vegetable gardens and orchards, say campaigners for a “right to grow” law. Incredible Edible, a network of more than 150 community growing groups, has drawn up plans to oblige local authorities to keep a register of public land suitable for vegetable and fruit-growing, which local groups could apply to access. The “right to grow” campaign has cross-party support from Lords and MPs, with calls for the government to incorporate it into forthcoming levelling up legislation. “This is a no-brainer if we really think we’ve got to give people better health, wellbeing and access to good food,” said Pam Warhurst, the co-founder of Incredible Edible, which began guerrilla food-growing on neglected public land in Todmorden, Yorkshire, in 2008. “It’s really simple and we don’t have to invest millions – let’s just better use land that taxpayers are already paying for.” The burgeoning community growing movement has spread to hundreds of places around Britain and in countries across the world, with food-growing beside doctor’s surgeries, in railway car park corners and even in wheelbarrows in the absence of more permanent plots. “There is an appetite for finding unloved bits of land, rolling up sleeves and growing food on it but we’ve found a very uneven playing field for people getting access to land in their community,” said Warhurst. “Currently, if you have a local authority who isn’t supportive for some reason then you’ve got a bit of a problem.” Local growers are sometimes deterred by councils citing health and safety concerns or insurance issues. “We haven’t killed anybody yet and we have no intention of doing so,” said Warhurst. Under the proposals, the new law would oblige councils to maintain a list of public land suitable for “community cultivation” or “environmental enhancement”, including land owned by the NHS, government agencies and possibly water utilities. Local people and volunteer groups could apply for a certificate of lawful use to cultivate the land for an agreed period, without any rental charges or ownership change. Land that was too contaminated for growing vegetables could still be used for bee-keeping, for instance. “The community growing movement has been having difficulties getting access to the land and this is about tipping that balance,” said Naomi Luhde-Thompson of Rights: Community: Action, a coalition of campaigners seeking to tackle the climate emergency who funded a legal assessment of the “right to grow” proposals, which could be first introduced into the House of Commons as a private member’s bill. Mike Kane, the MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East, wants to introducea 10-minute rule bill to raise the profile of the campaign in parliament. “In my constituency we have acres of land that is ripe for this and at the moment it can be difficult for the community to get access to it,” he said. “But there’s more and more interest in it, with social prescribing for green-fingered activities. We know that gardening and growing connects people to the land and improves their physical and mental health. “It would be great to see the right to grow in mainstream political parties’ manifestos.” According to Luhde-Thompson, policymakers have responded positively to the proposals, which are supported by legal advice from Landmark Chambers and have attracted the support of the crossbencher Rosie Boycott and Labour’s Barbara Young in the House of Lords. “Everybody is just, ‘This is fantastic, why aren’t we doing it?’ and now it’s just getting it in front of the government,” said Luhde-Thompson. “If we really want to get it into law we have to hitch it to some kind of government bill, and the planning law reforms or the levelling up bill could be an exciting opportunity.” Warhurst added: “We need people to be more active and get access to better food, which will keep them healthier. We have a planetary crisis. People have a role for creating more food for themselves and their communities that will give them health and happiness. This is an asset that is not being used properly. Does it not make sense to repurpose public land paid for by the taxpayer? “It requires one simple thing – the will of the politicians to do it. Why not?”",Lifestyle/Life and style,Community groups call for ‘right to grow’ food in UK’s unloved public spaces,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/02/community-groups-call-for-right-to-grow-food-in-uks-unloved-public-spaces
