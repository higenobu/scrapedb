3/29/2022,"John Oliver discussed the many systemic problems that face Americans battling drug addiction and made a plea for rapid change. The Last Week Tonight host spoke about the duality of using drugs, after showing a dated PSA. “Drugs can be a lot of fun, some in fact can be so much fun they ruin your fucking life,” he said. There has been a substantial rise in overdose deaths, with 100,000 Americans dying in a recent 12-month period, which is three times the number of traffic accident deaths and twice as many as those killed by guns. “Street drugs are an absolute mess right now,” he said in reference to the levels of fentanyl contamination in many other drugs,, which now accounts for two-thirds of overdose deaths. But the US has been “fuelled by fear and misinformation, directly leading to bad policy”, going back to the so-called war on drugs, including “shitty and racist” media coverage of “crack babies”, a phenomenon that was later debunked. There has also been a more recent and entirely false trope of law enforcement overdosing on fentanyl after merely touching it, something that was even used on Blue Bloods, “basically adult Paw Patrol”. Oliver called it “deeply irresponsible to keep perpetuating a medical impossibility” and said that “when you treat a drug like a bioweapon, you justify a punitive militarised response to it.” It’s a way to avoid the real issue, he said, and it “makes more sense to protect those who are genuinely at risk of overdosing” through harm reduction, which “accepts the reality that people will use illegal drugs and some people can’t or don’t want to stop, so rather than arrest them we might be better off trying to mitigate the damage done”. He spoke about the importance of clean needle programs and also testing drugs to find out what’s in them. But the latter is done via two valuable tools that thanks to drug war-era laws are technically illegal in many states. He called it “complete madness”. There is also the importance of naloxone, which can prevent fentanyl overdose. Oliver called it “incredibly effective” and “a fucking miracle”, yet the FDA has it under prescription-only status. There are also overdose prevention centres where people bring their own drugs and can use clean supplies. Professionals can then intervene if there’s trouble and provide addiction treatment if it’s wanted. But although the centres provide a crucial service, “whenever they are floated as an option, people freak the fuck out”. He played a montage of Republicans and Fox News pundits criticising the centres, calling them a “heroin shooting gallery”. Oliver pointed out that 30% of those who use the centres are more likely to enter into treatment and are 100% less likely to die. He warned against punishing addicts into abstinence and called on the Biden administration to give overdose prevention centers “a full-throated endorsement”. “Our ingrained stigmas around drugs and the people who use them run really deep,” he added. “We need to meet people where they are, help them transition into safe drug use to stay alive and remove barriers for those seeking addiction treatment.”",Arts/Television & radio,John Oliver: ‘street drugs are an absolute mess right now’,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/28/john-oliver-street-drugs-absolute-mess
3/29/2022,"Joe Biden will propose a new tax on America’s richest households when he unveils his latest budget on Monday. The Biden administration is set to propose a 20% minimum tax on households worth more than $100m. The proposal would raise more than $360bn over the next decade and “would make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters,” according to a factsheet released by the White House. The plan – called the “billionaire minimum income tax” – is the administration’s most aggressive move to date to tax the very wealthiest Americans. The tax is part of Biden’s $5.8tn budget proposal for 2023, which also sets aside billions for the police and military as well as investments in affordable housing, plans to tackle the US’s supply chain issues and gun violence. Billionaire wealth grew significantly during the coronavirus pandemic, helped by soaring share prices and a tax regime that charges investors less on their gains than those taxed on their income. “In 2021 alone, America’s more than 700 billionaires saw their wealth increase by $1tn, yet in a typical year, billionaires like these would pay just 8% of their total realized and unrealized income in taxes. A firefighter or teacher can pay double that tax rate,” the White House factsheet notes. Under the plan households worth more than $100m would have to give detailed accounts to the Internal Revenue Service of how their assets had fared over the year. Those who pay less than 20% on those gains would then be subject to an additional tax that would take their rate up to 20%. The Biden administration calculates that the tax would affect only the top 0.01% of American households, those worth over $100m million, and that more than half the revenue would come from households worth more than $1bn. The budget also looks set to tackle another issue that some economists have argued contributes to widening income inequality: share buybacks. In recent years cash-rich companies including Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, have used their funds to buy back huge quantities of their own shares, boosting their share price. Last year companies in the S&P 500 bought back a record $882bn of their own shares and Goldman Sachs estimates that figure will rise to $1tn this year. Critics charge that the purchases divert money from hiring new staff, raising wages and research and development. Research by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shows that there is “clear evidence that a substantial number of corporate executives today use buybacks as a chance to cash out”. The Biden proposal would stop executives from selling their shares for three years after a buyback is announced. Biden attempted to impose a 1% tax on share buybacks last year but the proposal failed in Congress. Both Biden’s billionaire tax and the share buyback proposal will also face tough opposition in Congress.

3/29/2022,"So that was Oscars 2022, or, as the Academy possibly refers to it: “The Oscars where absolutely nothing strange happened, and how was the play, Mrs Lincoln?” Apparently some broadcasters bleeped out the Punch Heard Around the World. Well, if it’s any consolation, TV viewers, even inside the Dolby Theater it wasn’t much clearer what the hell had happened, mainly because of the Oscars’ discombobulating determination to carry on – with the palpably strained smile of a Ziegfeld girl who has fallen down and broken her leg in several places, but is determined to get to the end of routine with a grin, dammit. Instead, everyone acted as if everything was totally normal, with Chris Rock having to present an award 10 seconds after Will Smith punched him on stage. It was the weirdest instance of gaslighting I had ever experienced – until half an hour later, when Smith won the best actor Oscar, and implied in his speech that his attack was all part of God’s plan and he had merely been “protecting” his family. Shame he didn’t bother to tell Rock what God’s plan had been about how to protect his face.It’s almost enough to make you feel sorry for the Academy: it spends decades trying to find ways to make the Oscars interesting, only for them to become interesting in a way it really didn’t want them to be. The Oscars’ producer, Will Packer, had decided the right way to make the Oscars interesting was to cut some of the technical awards from the live TV broadcast in the hope it would stop people from going on too much about politics. Turns out he could have let all those sound and editing folks have their moment on TV after all. “Too many awards” was never going to be the takeaway of the night.Even before the ceremony, this Oscars was shaping up to be the most ridiculous yet, thanks to celebrities who continue to prove that Team America underplayed its satire. One of this year’s hosts, Amy Schumer, announced that she was fighting the bravest battle currently being waged in the west: trying to get more political content into the Oscars. And to this end, she wanted to give a boost to the latest sexy starlet, the content-provider everyone’s talking about, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine. “I wanted to find a way to have Zelenskiy satellite in or make a tape or something, just because there are so many eyes on the Oscars,” she said. Yes, so true. Unlike that silly war, which no one knows about, because it’s, like, super far away and not even on the front of Variety. “I am not afraid to go there,” Schumer carried on bravely, “but it’s not me producing the Oscars.” Sean Penn then issued what was described by some journalists as “an ultimatum” and by this journalist as “a parp” when he announced on Saturday that he would “smelt” his Oscar in public unless someone from the Academy would “check in with the leadership in Ukraine”.It’s always the celebrities who are the most keen to prove how deep and un-Hollywood they are who reveal themselves to be the most shallow and Hollywood-centric of all. Only a brain that has been severely corroded with too much Botox or narcissism would think that a politician in the middle of a literal actual war is waiting for a call from the Academy. “Oh please, Amy Schumer,” Zelenskiy is no doubt thinking right now, in between walking through bombed-out hospitals and asking for more foreign aid, “Please make me a star at the Oscars! Can I send in my audition tape?”Spoiler: Zelenskiy was a no-show, and the references to Ukraine were notably limited. But there was a mid-show “moment of silence” (and hashtag) for Ukraine, which, by a remarkable coincidence, lasted exactly the same amount of time as was needed for the stagehands to change the set. So convenient! I love it when resolving international conflicts can be multitasked with the housekeeping. Like doing the ironing while catching up on your podcasts: two birds, one hashtag.It was shortly after the moment of silence that The Incident happened. Now, I am sure there will be much commentary over the coming days about why Smith punched Rock and who was more in the wrong (answer: Smith). But as I was in the theatre when it happened, and not a million miles away from Rock, I would like to point out a few oddities about the whole thing. 1. It’s quite weird that Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith were fine with the host Regina Hall joking about their open marriage early in the evening, but not with Rock joking about Pinkett Smith’s hair, no? 2. To all the people saying Rock’s jokes were dickish, it’s a good thing you didn’t hear Schumer completely roasting everyone else in the room earlier in the evening, and none of them slugged her in the face. 3. No one in the auditorium knew at first whether this was all a joke or not, and nor, it seemed, did Smith. I watched his reaction to Rock’s joke and at first he laughed. Then he saw how annoyed his wife was, then he realised the whole audience saw that because the camera was on her, then he got angry and got up to punch Rock. However anyone wants to spin it, he went on quite an emotional journey. 4. When Smith then claimed in his, um, let’s just call it his acceptance speech that he had been “protecting” his family, just as he “protected Aunjanue” Ellis during the making of King Richard, Ellis did not look best pleased. And who could blame her? 5. Judging by Smith’s general demeanour, I would say Geoffrey the butler needs to give him a good talking to.Lots to cogitate on, but not for the Oscars, which dealt with the incident in a single terse tweet, and not with any of the celebrities at the event. Usually at the Governors Ball, directly after the ceremony, the celebrities are happy to talk about anything. But for the first time in my decade of covering the Oscars, not only would they not talk about anything, but many brought their PRs with them as protection. Any journalist who dared to get too close to Oscar winners Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas was quickly shooed away by an anxious PR, and same for Francis Ford Coppola. Steven Spielberg was happy to pose for selfies with everyone and their mother, but when I asked if he had enjoyed the evening, he replied, very politely, that he wouldn’t be answering questions. Happily, you can always rely on a Canadian to laugh at the ridiculous Americans, and Denis Villeneuve did not disappoint. I asked what he made of the evening. “It was unpredictable,” he laughed. “Although last time I was here was when they mixed up the envelopes with Moonlight and La La Land, so my wife and I were like: ‘What happens when we come to the Oscars? Is it us?’” I tried to ask Jane Campion what she made of the evening, but at that point the DJ started playing Satisfaction by the Rolling Stones and she, Benedict Cumberbatch and Kodi Smit-McPhee broke into some extremely enthusiastic dancing, and I worried she might clobber me with her Oscar. So I headed over to the Vanity Fair party, thinking maybe people would be sufficiently relaxed (drunk) there to talk. But no. The first people I saw were the Williams sisters, who are far too godlike to approach. So instead I went up to Mr Serena, AKA Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit. What Reddit threads was he expecting to see on tonight’s awards? “Ummm, I didn’t know they let press in here?” he said with faux-but-actually-a-bit-genuine nervousness, while looking around for security. Only the best press are let in, Alexis. So what did he think of the ceremony? “Look, I’m just a plus-one here. I’ll just say I’m very happy for the family and that’s it,” he said.The whole party was a heaving mass of suppressed hysteria. In one corner, James Corden chatted intensely with Adrien Brody and Georgina Chapman, AKA Harvey Weinstein’s ex-wife; in another, Kourtney Kardashian stalked past Trevor Noah. It was hellish and hyper-real, and everyone seemed giddy and anxious at the same time, excited to be out, but not sure what was allowed. “This is the first time I’ve been out in two years – and without a mask! It feels naughty but nice,” said Michael B Jordan. So what did he make of the Oscars ceremony? “Oh, I’m not talking about that,” he said. Even Larry David – a man whose whole shtick is being rude about everything – declined to speak about the evening, as did Jake Gyllenhaal, Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper.Maybe none of them could figure out what the right opinion is about Rock and Smith. After all, to have an opinion you need principles, and those aren’t included in the Oscars gift bag. Or maybe they just didn’t want to be bothered with boring questions on their first night out in two years. Just as I was about to give up and go home, I spotted Jesse Plemons, on whom I harbour a quiet and not entirely professional crush. So what did he make of the evening? He was sitting right behind Smith, wasn’t he? “Yeah, we were pretty close,” he said, referring to himself and his fiancee, fellow nominee Kirsten Dunst. “At first I thought it was a joke …” Me too, Jesse! “Then when Smith was shouting all those swearwords, I thought: ‘Oh, maybe they’ll bleep those out.’” That’s exactly what I thought! We have so much in common! “And then I realised it wasn’t a joke, and yeah, it was pretty weird. But you know, all this,” he said, gesturing around the party, “is pretty strange, and everyone’s feeling so riled up and strange, and everything’s kinda nuts. So maybe it kinda made sense, you know?” Oh, Jesse Plemons. So lovely and wise. So maybe that’s the right opinion: it’s a weird time so it was a weird Oscars. That seemed like a nice gentle take to end the evening on. But just as I was leaving, I spotted Sean Combs. He always struck me as a man with little fear of expressing an opinion, so I asked him what he made of Smith whacking Rock. “Best Oscars ever. Ever!” he shouted, walking off. Then came back, looked me square in the eye and said: “Best. Oscars. Ever.”",Arts/Film,Don’t mention that slap!

3/29/2022,"Louis van Gaal has told Erik ten Hag he should consider turning down the manager’s job at Old Trafford because Manchester United are a “commercial club” and he would be “better going to a football club”. Manchester United have held talks with Ten Hag as they continue their search for a manager. The Ajax head coach is one of several candidates on the shortlist to take over from the interim manager Ralf Rangnick in the summer. But the Netherlands manager, who was sacked by Manchester United after winning the FA Cup in May 2016, is not sure a move to Old Trafford would be a wise one for Ten Hag. “Erik ten Hag is a great coach and that is always good for Manchester United,” Van Gaal said at a press conference to preview Tuesday’s friendly between Netherlands and Germany. “But Manchester United are a commercial club, so it’s a difficult choice for a coach. He would be better going to a football club. I’m not going to advise him, he’ll call me himself. But he must choose a football club and not a commercial club.” Ten Hag has been in the top job at Ajax for five seasons, winning the Eredivisie twice and taking the club to the semi-finals of the 2019 Champions League. Ajax are leading the Eredivisie by two points but were knocked out of the Champions League by Benfica this month despite dominating possession in both legs of the last-16 tie. Current Paris St-Germain manager, Mauricio Pochettino, Spain head coach Luis Enrique and Sevilla’s Julen Lopetegui have also been linked with the vacant post. Whoever succeeds Rangnick may have to oversee a season with no Champions League football.

3/29/2022,"To paraphrase one of Chris Rock’s greatest jokes, Will Smith ain’t go crazy last night at the Oscars; Will Smith went Will Smith. Quite the spontaneous contemporary dance routine, though, huh? Remember, kids, violence is never the answer, especially if it’s going to subject everyone to a full week of hot takes, polarised op-eds and memes. Oh Will! How could you! The Fiver is also sad that the incident has instantly become the most famous and notorious on-stage hand-jaw-interface scenario in history, eclipsing that time Jerry Sadowitz took to the stage in Montreal and opened with “I tell you why I hate Canada, half of you speak French, and the other half let them” with predictable consequences. Sadowitz an acquired taste, to be fair. But that’s not the only reason our thoughts have turned to the Canadians, and seeing you’re asking, yes this does register the maximum 11 on our patented Tenuousconvolutedintro-o-meter™. That’s because on Sunday night, Canada’s men made it to the World Cup finals for the first time since 1986 (which is coincidentally the last time anybody paid any attention to the Academy Awards). John Herdman’s swashbuckling counter-attacking side guaranteed their place in Qatar with a 4-0 rout of Jamaica, the cheese curds and gravy on an already delicious plate of steaming-hot fries that represent wins in Mexico and the USA! USA!! USA!!! as well as that Alphonso Davies goal against Panama, a combination of such speed and grace that it knocks even the work of your Gareth Bales and Mo Salahs into a c0cked straw hat. Davies is the star man, though most of the plaudits are heading in the direction of Herdman, who already has done more than his bit for Canadian football, having led the women to a couple of bronze-medal finishes at Big Sports Day, setting them on a trajectory that saw them win gold under his former assistant Bev Preistman last year. The men were long overdue a contribution and they’ve finally made it, the win over Jamaica guaranteeing a top-three finish in the Concacaf table. Most likely they’ll be joined later this week by Mexico, for whom a draw in their final match at home against El Salvador will do, and the US, who will make it unless they lose by six goals or more in Costa Rica. Let’s face it, rather like that dust-up at the Oscars, it’s all over bar the shouting (and tweeting, releasing of press statements, candid interviews with Oprah, etc). “My dream is to see Ukraine and its people smile again.

3/29/2022,"Gareth Southgate has said he faces a “complicated decision” over whether to keep faith with Harry Maguire for England after the defender’s struggles at club level and hinted he has a lack of experienced replacements to choose from. The Manchester United centre-back did not feature in England’s friendly win over Switzerland on Saturday despite Southgate defending his inclusion in the squad last week after a poor spell of form at Old Trafford. Maguire is in contention to start against Ivory Coast on Tuesday night in what would be his 42nd cap for the senior side having been an ever-present during England’s qualification campaign. Asked if Maguire was still one of the best players at his disposal given his recent loss of form, Southgate insisted the former Leicester defender still has plenty of credit left in the bank with England but cannot be assured of his place. “He got us to a World Cup semi-final and the European Championship final so there’s no doubt he’s more than capable of playing at the highest level,” said Southgate. “He was very good for us in the autumn and the club are in a difficult moment. There could be any number of reasons for that. But that doesn’t mean that players can be poor for a couple of years and then still find their way in and sometimes it depends on competition for positions. “We’ve obviously left some forward players out who haven’t been in good form. But there’s direct replacements, experienced replacements for those players. So as I say, it is a complicated decision.” With Southgate expected to omit Harry Kane against Ivory Coast, the England manager refused to confirm who would take the captain’s armband from the Tottenham forward at Wembley. The vice-captain, Jordan Henderson, played 90 minutes against Switzerland and could also be rested with Maguire or Raheem Sterling among the other options. “I’ll let Ivory Coast find out when we put a team sheet in,” said Southgate. “If [Kane] had his way he would play 90 minutes of every fixture, which is a brilliant quality to have because if your captain wants to be at every camp and playing every minute of every game that sets the tone for everything else. The fact is, we’ve got a good squad. We want to keep people involved and give people opportunities. We need to see certain things across the week to see how people can play at the level.”",Sport/Football,‘A complicated decision’: Southgate faces Maguire quandary for England,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/28/england-harry-maguire-gareth-southgate
3/29/2022,"So Coda has triumphed at the Oscars; the likable cheese-fest with a feelgood plot is hardly great cinema, but it’s also hard to dislike. The moments when Troy Kotsur won the Bafta this month, and then the Oscar last night, were enough to have this cynical old disability activist jumping out of his chair with glee and admiration for both the actor himself and the coolness of his acceptance speeches. Coda’s win is a key moment in the sometimes problematic relationship between disability and cinema. Coming so soon after the triumph of Rose Ayling-Ellis on Strictly, this is a chance for us disabled people to revel in the spotlight that Deafness has had this awards season, a moment where Deaf people are in the public consciousness and are being celebrated. Let’s hope that focus leads to better access for Deaf people and scrutiny of the horrific cuts to Deaf education and access that have been made during the austerity era (and are yet to be rectified). Dan Edge, who sits on the Equity diversity committee and is an accomplished actor in his own right, has said that the success of Coda and Kotsur’s win throws a bomb at the perceived industry wisdom that disabled actors are not bankable. It is a big moment for disabled talent all round and I sense we won’t be waiting another 35 years for a disabled actor to win a major award, like we have been since Marlee Matlin picked up best actress in 1987. There is a great opportunity for the streamers, who can take risks with disabled talent that perhaps studios and distributors will not. But what about the writers, directors and producers? The above-the-line, behind-the-scenes talent who get these films made and are the creative force behind a plucky and small, yet properly financed indie like Coda? The reality is that Deaf and disabled directors are not getting the chances they should and being a disabled director seems to remain a difficult sell in film and television. Last week the BBC aired Then Barbara Met Alan, written by disabled flag bearer and all-round good guy Jack Thorne and Deaf actor turned writer Genevieve Barr. It was an exciting piece of event television, with brilliant performances by a disabled cast and an ace disabled producer in Bryony Arnold. But the BBC told me that, due to the film’s complexity and scale, there was not a disabled director right for the role. It is debatable if this is true, but if it is, where is the disabled talent and why is it not being developed and given breaks? Amit Sharma, a disabled co-director, was brought on a few weeks before shooting, which sadly smacks of a token gesture. This is not meant to disrespect Sian Heder, the director of Coda, who has done a sterling job of crafting the film into an audience-facing Oscar winner. But it would have been really groundbreaking if a disabled director could have been seen clutching that best picture Oscar. Someone who has the experience of difference and knows what it is to be disabled. Hopefully, the industry takeaway from Coda will be that disability can sell and that will open a few doors for new, emerging talent. If only three women have ever won a directing Oscar, when will the first disabled director be awarded one?",Arts/Film,Will Coda’s Oscar triumph open the doors for disabled film-makers?

3/29/2022,"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russian authorities of disrespect towards the families of their own dead soldiers, criticising Moscow for not agreeing on a scheme to have the remains of those killed in action returned to Russia. Zelenskiy claimed the Kremlin was affording less respect to those killed during its invasion of Ukraine than is usually given to dead pets. “We’ve all had a moment in our lives when someone has passed away, maybe not even close people or relatives. Listen: even when a dog or a cat dies, that’s just not how to behave,” Zelenskiy said in an online interview with Russian journalists on Sunday evening. “I’m saying this to you as the president of a country that is fighting with Russian soldiers … It’s a war, but they are not animals.” Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, who is responsible for negotiations with Moscow on returning the remains, said that despite repeated offers for Russia to present lists of the missing and have them returned, officials in Moscow were more concerned about covering up the scale of the losses. She said she had spoken by telephone or Zoom to several Russian officials, including the deputy defence minister, Alexander Fomin, and Tatyana Moskalkova, the Kremlin’s ombudsman for human rights. “The Russian authorities don’t want these bodies. I talked to her, and said: ‘Take your bodies away.’ She had no response. She just said, ‘We’ll work on it,’” said Vereshchuk. Russia’s defence ministry last week announced an official death toll of 1,351 for the first month of what Moscow has insisted on calling a “special military operation” in Ukraine, but Kyiv says the real total is more than 16,000. Nato last week estimated the Russian death toll to be between 7,000 and 15,000. Ukraine has not released figures about its own casualties. Zelenskiy’s adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the Russians had been using mobile crematoria in Crimea and Belarus to dispose of the remains of some soldiers, and that others were hard to retrieve. “They are lying there in the fields and the Russians don’t take them. There are corpses inside ruined tanks; they’re burnt and difficult to get out,” he said. Vereshchuk said Ukraine had the bodies of at least 2,000 Russian soldiers in refrigerated storage in different regions across the country, as well as other cases where there were some charred remains or simply a identification token with a name, but that the Russians were not interested. “We are counting them all. We have the remains in fridges. We say to them, take them, they are in body bags, we can give them to the Red Cross, send them to the Belarusian border, to wherever you want, we’ll give you these bodies,” said Vereshchuk. She added this would require Russia to send lists of the missing via the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which Ukraine would then compare with the bodies it had and could return those that matched. The Russian authorities, she said, did not want to send lists because that would involve admitting how many soldiers have been killed. Ukrainian officials have said they are trying to treat the remains of Russian soldiers with respect. However, they have also launched a Telegram channel that lists information about those killed in the invasion and that often features grisly photographs of their remains. Some legal experts have said this may violate the Geneva conventions. On Monday, videos were circulated on a pro-Ukrainian Telegram account appearing to show Ukrainian soldiers using the phone of a dead Russian to call his relatives and gloat over his death. The video could not immediately be verified. Svetlana Golub, the head of the Soldiers’ Mothers Committee, an NGO advocating for Russian soldiers’ rights, blamed Ukrainian authorities for blocking the return of bodies. “Zelenskiy is simply lying. I am ready to personally go and pick up the bodies. The Ukrainian authorities aren’t allowing us to do it,” she said. She said her organisation had written several letters to Ukrainian police. “But they either refuse our requests or tell us that Russia first has to take back all of its troops. Sometimes they ignore our requests altogether,” she said. In a previous interview with the Guardian, Golub said officials in the Russian ministry of defence were “dragging their feet” over returning the bodies. This time, Golub said she “couldn’t speak on behalf of her government”. Some Russian NGOs and human rights experts are being careful not to openly criticise the country’s role in Ukraine after the president, Vladimir Putin, signed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. Golub said Ukrainian authorities were demanding that relatives take a DNA test before they could receive the bodies of their dead family members. “That would mean each mother will have to come to Ukraine and give them her DNA. But why should the mother of a dead Russian soldier transfer her DNA to another state?” Vereshchuk said the process under discussion for individual returns would actually involve Russian relatives providing a DNA sample to the ICRC inside Russia, after which Ukraine would hand remains over to the ICRC for return to their relatives. A spokesperson for the ICRC said no such agreement had yet been reached. “We have ongoing discussions with the authorities on both sides on the issue of war prisoners, dead bodies and missing,” said the spokesperson.",News/World news,"Kremlin disrespecting families as it stalls return of own dead, says Zelenskiy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/kremlin-russia-families-return-dead-bodies-ukraine-volodymyr-zelenskiy
3/29/2022,"When Joseph Goebbels offered him the chance to become head of film-making in Nazi Germany, director Fritz Lang wondered if it might be time to leave. How quickly Lang left Germany after the Goebbels meeting – indeed whether he really met Goebbels at all – has recently been disputed. But by 1935 the eye-patched visionary behind Metropolis and M had fled Europe and reached Hollywood, MGM contract secured. By the war’s end, Lang had produced three anti-Nazi films attacking his former would-be employers. He was now experimenting with American genre material. In 1944, his sly noir The Woman in the Window played elliptically with dream states and temporality. The following year came his second attempt at the genre: Scarlet Street. The set-up is simple. Long-serving bank cashier Chris Cross (Edward G Robinson) has a weekend interest in painting and falls in love with an actress (Joan Bennett) who volunteers to become his model. With the New York art establishment hungry for something new, this could be Cross’s big break. Except Cross is still married, and his new model has a nefarious boyfriend, very much with a plan of his own. The story was adapted from a novel by Georges de la Fouchardière, which had previously been filmed by Jean Renoir. But Lang made it distinctively his own. At the core of the tale is the inexorable fall of our wannabe artist. Seemingly disgusted by Cross’s naivety and impotence, Lang plunges him ever further into despair. Edward G Robinson sells it perfectly. He was always capable of a naturalness and maturity that contradicted prevailing norms in contemporary acting. But by being both the most natural and the most sympathetic presence on-screen, Robinson makes his character’s ruination all the more tragic. As Cross’s model, Joan Bennett experiments with the template of the femme fatale. She’s sexy in a casual, rather than sultry, way. At times reluctant and unsure, Bennett freights a playful performance with revealing moments of vulnerability. OK, so this subtlety is somewhat undermined by a burst into maniacal laughter late in the movie. But having put so much work into nuance already, Bennett’s earned a bit of melodrama. Scarlet Street is melodramatic in all the right ways. When the acting is – to modern eyes – exaggerated, it is to emphasise characters experiencing subjective realities. A late scene has a character hear voices in his mind and contemplate suicide in an apartment with a flashing neon sign outside the window. His theatrical flailing, illuminated intermittently by the cold throb of the incoming light, could have come from early German expressionism. So could some of the film’s other images: bedrooms bordered by mirrors; street corners contoured by shadows and glazed with urban rain. Now comfortable in the US, Lang was returning to the stylistic ambitions of his pre-Nazi German period. Like Cross, he seemed eager for artistic development, and the re-integration of sexuality into his work, after his earnest wartime features. But Lang also had a striking new fatalism. Just as the first wave of German expressionism had emerged from the rupture of the first world war, so would its revival in Los Angeles develop from the tragedy of the second. Lang had seen up-close how the Weimar Germany of his greatest achievements had fallen into fascism and evil. He had narrowly avoided becoming trapped in its national disgrace himself. So now he looked for stories about catastrophe occurring in circumstances which rendered it inevitable. From the moment Cross breaks his personal rule on smoking, in the first scene of the film, we know he is doomed. Like Germany, he engineers his own destruction, and ends up committing horrendous crimes. Be careful who you sympathise with, Lang appears to say. Not everything in Scarlet Street works perfectly. Cross’s wife is a one-dimensional “shrew”, shrieking and screeching and appearing parachuted in from a Jacobethan farce. There’s more than a whiff of misogyny about her character, and it stands out all the more among the film’s general sensitivity. Still, Scarlet Street is a superb film. It’s a pulpy noir and an experiment in expressionism. It can also be read as a postwar parable of moral collapse. Yet what lingers is its tragedy. There’s a moment near the film’s end – well before Cross’s humiliation is complete – when a relatively minor misdemeanour is discovered by his boss. The boss summons Cross to his office to fire him. Cross looks up at the camera, exhausted and broken. And the most pathetic figure in the movies will break your heart.

3/29/2022,"Leading refugee charities have called on the UK government to scrap visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees, amid mounting anger about the government’s slow progress in issuing paperwork to people fleeing a war zone. Applicants to host Ukrainian refugees under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have expressed concern that some refugees are being forced to remain in the conflict zone while UK visas are processed. A Conservative councillor resigned from the party at the weekend after being shocked at the red tape surrounding the UK’s Ukraine visa system, which she said reflected the government’s “hostile” and “xenophobic” approach to refugees. Samantha Flower has applied to sponsor a 17-year-old Ukrainian boy to live with her family in Buxton, Derbyshire, but said she had been met by delays and bureaucracy. The child has been forced to remain in Ukraine while the paperwork is processed. “If he doesn’t make it out alive it’s because the red tape prevented it,” she said. Her unease was reflected by the statement from the heads of the Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam who warned that the visa system was “causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians”. “Those who want to come to the UK are having to navigate a complex web of bureaucratic paperwork to get visas, leaving them facing protracted delays without any information about the status of their application,” the charity heads wrote in a letter published on Monday in the Times. “The government must urgently review the use of visas and waive them as an immediate short-term measure, as has been done by the EU, and look to introduce a simplified emergency humanitarian visa process.” Flower, a councillor on High Peak borough council, has signed up to the UK’s Home for Ukraine scheme, where strangers act as hosts, but has not yet been approved. Only 1,000 of the 25,000 completed applications have been approved so far. The boy and his stepmother and father, both lawyers, fled their home in Kyiv when Russia invaded. They arranged for the teenager to travel to the UK after contacting Flower online, where the councillor had offered her home. However, the boy has only a domestic Ukrainian passport and not the international passport required by the UK as part of its visa process. The boy’s family have had to stay in Ukraine and wait for the correct paperwork – a process they have been told could take weeks.“They’re having to wait for the passport to be completed,” said Flower. “They had a shell land near their home five or six days ago. They don’t know from one day to the other what’s going to happen.” She said the government’s complex visa system for Ukrainians reflected its “hostile” approach to all refugees, adding: “We’re tipping towards being quite far right and it’s not the party that I joined.” More than 3.9 million refugees have left Ukraine in the past month, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, more than 2.2 million of whom have ended up in Poland. The Home Office has granted 21,600 visas to Ukrainians who are hoping to join relatives in Britain under the Ukraine Family scheme. The Department for Levelling Up, which is handling the parallel Homes for Ukraine scheme, for people who do not have family in the UK, has not yet released any figures about the number of visas granted. However, refugee hosting charities say the numbers of people coming through this scheme are so far “tiny”. Lauren Scott, director of hosting charity Refugees at Home, said: “We have been told anecdotally that the delay is largely down to the onerous visa application process, which is frustrating for our hosts and must be soul-destroying for guests. It is creating a huge bottleneck. So far we only know of three sponsorship visas granted to potential guests, and that’s all to one family.” An opinion poll released on Sunday by Savanta ComRes indicated that 54% of people in the UK support a no-visa policy, and would like to allow an unlimited number of Ukrainians who are fleeing the Russian invasion to come to the UK.",News/World news,"UK visa rule leaving refugees stranded in war-torn Ukraine, say charities",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/28/uk-visa-rule-is-leaving-refugees-stranded-in-war-torn-ukraine-say-charities
3/29/2022,"There have been few genuine clowns in theatre and television as good as Denise Coffey, who has died aged 85. She was a key TV presence in British comedy over its most redefining postwar period, and to see her on stage, always puckish and delightful, was to invest in two or three hours of an invaluable spiritual tonic. She was a crucial member of the ebullient Young Vic company formed in 1970 under the aegis of the National Theatre at the Old Vic to deliver classics and new plays with regard to a younger audience. She had already, in the 1960s, played a series of classical and low-life roles at Bernard Miles’s Mermaid theatre in Puddle Dock. She emerged at the Young Vic, under Frank Dunlop’s direction, trailing several film credits and a high profile in surreal television comedy – notably in ITV’s Do Not Adjust Your Set (1967-69) – influenced by the radio comedy of the Goons and prefiguring Monty Python. She and David Jason formed the “legit showbiz” element in a company of university wits – Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Eric Idle, the producer Humphrey Barclay – with musical incursions from Vivian Stanshall’s delirious Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band. There followed two popular series on ITV: Girls About Town (1970-71) in which she and the singer Julie Stevens were living it large in Acacia Avenue; and Hold the Front Page (1974), in which Coffey led a bunch of crazy newsroom assistants chasing down a “Mr Big” involved in a Great Rug Scandal. End of Part One (1979) was a satirical soap in which Mr and Mrs Straightman (Tony Aitken and Coffey as Norman and Vera) were disrupted in their domestic dullness by a panoply of famous people on television; Coffey herself turned up as Robin Day in those trademark cruel glasses. She was a total one-off: under five feet tall, elfin-looking, punchy and eccentric. In her private life, she was determinedly single, vegetarian and finally remote, especially after she discovered the joys of the West Country – she moved from London to Salcombe in Devon – and living by the sea. She was a regular in a couple of Stanley Baxter’s TV comedy series in 1968 and 1971 and went wildly over the top as the grotesque manager of Alexei Sayle’s hopeless nightclub comedian, Bobby Chariot, in Sayle’s Merry-Go-Round in 1998. Denise was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, the only child of Dorothy (nee Malcolm), and her husband, Denis Coffey, a proud Irishman from Cork and squadron leader in the RAF. They moved north to Dorothy’s native Scotland, living near Inverkeithing in Fife and later in Milesmark outside Dunfermline, where Denise was educated at Dunfermline high school and trained at the Glasgow College of Drama and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music. She made a professional acting debut at the Opera House, Dunfermline, in 1954, “as various apparitions” in Macbeth. By 1962, she was playing the star turn, the word-mangling Mrs Malaprop, in Sheridan’s The Rivals at the Gateway in Edinburgh and then, in 1963, the insalubrious Mrs Coaxer in a revival of John Gay’s The Beggar’s Opera for the Royal Shakespeare Company at the Aldwych in London (alongside Dorothy Tutin, Patience Collier and Elizabeth Spriggs); she was pressing her claims to join the top table. A West End highlight was playing the maid, Edith, in High Spirits, a Broadway musical version of Noël Coward’s Blithe Spirit, directed by Coward himself, at the Savoy theatre in 1964, in a cast including Denis Quilley, Marti Stevens and Cecily Courtneidge. She had made a television debut in 1959 in a BBC adaptation of Walter Scott’s Redgauntlet and consolidated her theatre reputation at the Mermaid in various classics and new plays, notably as 19-year-old Fanny O’Dowda in George Bernard Shaw’s Fanny’s First Play – as a prosecuted suffragist turned feminist playwright; and as the non-speaking but occasionally flatulent Cicely Bumtrinket – a favourite role, not even identified in most cast lists – in Thomas Dekker’s Elizabethan city comedy The Shoemaker’s Holiday. She also featured in several important 60s films: as Peter Sellers’s eccentric daughter Sidonia Fitzjohn (alongside Prunella Scales as her sister) in John Guillermin’s Waltz of the Toreadors (1962); as Lynn Redgrave’s mousy little friend, Peg, in Georgy Girl (1966); and as Soberness in John Schlesinger’s Far from the Madding Crowd (1967) starring Julie Christie and Alan Bates. On location in Dorset for the last of these, she visited nearby Devon, where she would return to live permanently. But not before her Young Vic stint – as both actor and associate director – in the 70s, where she was a standout company member alongside Jim Dale, Jane Lapotaire, Andrew Robertson and Nicky Henson. Her roles, all invested with incomparable zest and cheek, included Beatrice in Much Ado, a rare double of Mistress Overdone and Mariana in Measure for Measure and Doll Common in Ben Jonson’s The Alchemist. She toured Europe and north America with the company, appearing with them at the Edinburgh festivals of 1967, 1971 and 1972, notably as a harassed Scottish housewife in a Comedy of Errors relocated from Ephesus to Edinburgh. When her mentor Dunlop was appointed director of the festival in 1985, she provided a brilliant Scottish version of Molière’s Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme – A Wee Touch of Class – starring Rikki Fulton as “Archibald” (real name, Charles) Jenner, the 19th-century founder of the famous store, Jenners, on Princes Street; Coffey was Netty, a scrofulous clog-dancing servant from Fife. She appeared in a fine, early Film on Four, Michael Radford’s Another Time, Another Place (1983). Her work on radio included guest appearances on I’m Sorry I Haven’t a Clue and Just a Minute, and two series by Sue Limb: The Wordsmiths of Gorsemere (1985-87), a very funny send-up of the Lakeland poets, Coffey herself as Dorothy Wordsmith, Tim Curry as Lord Biro and Simon Callow as Samuel Tailor Cholericke; and Alison and Maud (2002-04), teaming with Miriam Margolyes as a pair of bizarrely eccentric landladies. A 1980 film written by Stanshall, Sir Henry at Rawlinson End, in which she played a tapeworm-obsessed woman called Mrs E, won cult status when issued on DVD in 2006. “It’s impossible to do justice,” said the critic Nigel Andrews, “to the film’s arrant and quite unique lunacy.” In the 80s, in Canada, she directed plays for John Neville at his Neptune theatre in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and for Christopher Newton at the Shaw festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario. Her output was increasingly sporadic as she happily hunkered down in Salcombe, “exploring my artistic bent”, fishing in a small boat with a tiny outboard motor, gardening and making rare excursions to London, always travelling by taxi. She is survived by a cousin, Linda.

3/29/2022,"Shortly before Mother’s Day last year, I was in Sainsbury’s, arguing with my mother over the phone, and said: “I don’t want to talk about this any more, Mummy!” Everyone around tried to stifle their laughter, but the guy in front of me just couldn’t contain himself, and said, “How old even are you?”, and I said, “47”, with a sort of “What of it? This is a perfectly normal age to call your mum ‘Mummy’, and I am just a normal person, in the shops, having a normal day” and the woman on the till was trying so hard to remain composed that her eyes filled with real tears. What can I say? It’s a 70s thing. If you missed the window during adolescence to shift from “Mummy” to “Mum”, because you were busy sniffing glue and whatnot, the wind changes and you’re stuck like that. My sister and I say “Mummy”, and, because we know how shameful that is, when we’re in public we call her “the old trout”. Once a year, on Mother’s Day, we stop doing that out of respect, which makes no difference to her because she doesn’t know we do it in the first place. That’s why Mother’s Day, for all the effort Marks & Spencer makes, can never be commercialised, and that’s why it doesn’t change that much from one decade to the next: the genuine way to mark it is with a 24-hour amnesty, where you stop doing the thing your mum hates, even if she doesn’t know about it. That’s why it’s so exhausting and that’s why – thank God – it’s over. My own offspring have a moratorium on sibling rivalry. You’d think I’d be pleased, right? I’ve been complaining about this for 12 solid years. I’ve read research papers, detailing the exact intervals to expect a clash. Aged one and three, apparently, you can expect a blowup every 11 minutes. This interval steadily increases, so that, by the time they are 36 and 34, they are just texting each other guilt trips and passive aggressive memes every four days. I’ve listened to podcasts in which the exact reason that it’s all the parents’ fault is detailed so sensitively, so perceptively, that you don’t even mind. (It’s all about favouritism, and perceptions thereof, but you knew that. The interesting bit is the taxonomy of preference. There’s the prodigal fallacy, where you prefer your magical firstborn, and the narcissist bias, preferring the one who most resembles you; there are so many potential ways to fail, your best hope is that your failures are so various, they cancel each other out.) Anyway, the near-constant chorus of sibling grievance comes to an abrupt halt one day a year, like Christmas Day at the Somme, and as their ages creep up, they do better and better impressions of civilised, respectful, loving family members. The 12-year-old still cheated at poker on Sunday, and the 14-year-old still pointed out the impunity of it, but there followed a solemn apology ceremony. When they sat down to eat, they passed things to each other rather than pelting each other with bread rolls like a pair of chimps, and nobody said anything about vegetarianism being stupid, or accused anyone of eating like a squirrel, and after about half a day of this, I was sort of broken-hearted. Is there anything more painful than watching your children behave like adults? Soon that’s what they’ll be. The last time they end a meal with cake in their hair, shouting, may already have passed. Plus, I could see how much it was costing them, this gift of being polite to each other. The price was too high; I couldn’t accept it. In the end, I told them they didn’t have to be different, that they could fight all day long and they would still be the best thing that ever happened to me, and my son said: “I find that difficult to believe. We’re only people.” And I said: “That is the single dumbest thing you’ve ever said,” while thinking adulthood, praise be, is still some way away.
