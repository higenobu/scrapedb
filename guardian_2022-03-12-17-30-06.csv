3/12/2022,"If Ann Hamilton were a commercial trainer, her base in Northumberland might be a little easier to find. It would just be a case of looking for a queue of people eager to send her a horse, and following it all the way to her front door. As it is, even a taxi driver who has been working the area for the last 20 years has never been asked to find Great Bavington before. What is, by some measures at least, the most successful National Hunt stable in the country this season feels as if it is not so much on the path less travelled as at the end of a road to nowhere. And the Hamiltons, you soon sense, would not have it any other way. Ann Hamilton, who celebrated her 70th birthday this past week, was “born just down the road” and has only one owner in her yard: her 74-year-old husband, Ian. Claywalls farm, which was originally owned by Ann’s father, has been their home since they were married, 42 years ago. “My family moved up here from County Durham and we went out hunting together, that’s how we met,” Ian says. “It took nine years to catch her, she went that fast on her pony.” These days, the 500-acre farm is home to 1,000 sheep, 300 cattle, five racehorses and, for the last two years, the most impressive strike rate in the game. Last year’s stats were outstanding, with 12 winners from 37 runners. This year, though, the numbers are off the chart. Led by Tommy’s Oscar, who will line up in the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham on Tuesday, Ann’s tiny string has won a dozen races from 28 starts, a remarkable strike rate of 43%, earning a total of £222,761 in prize money. It is enough to make Ian the fourth-most successful owner in British jumping this season, with an ambitious tilt at a £250,000 first prize next week still to come. It is the polar opposite of normal service in modern jump racing, when the same handful of trainers with three-figure strings divide up the big prizes among themselves. As the couple talk about their successes so far and their hopes for more to come, the conversation flits seamlessly from one to the other and back again. “It’s sheer dedication,” Ian says. “We’re out there with the horses when other trainers can’t do it, because they’ve got so many. We start at six in the morning and the last feed is eight o’clock [at night], and it’s usually after nine when Ann comes in. “That’s every day, seven days a week. I do the cattle and sheep and Ann does the horses, and if I need a hand, she helps me, and if she needs a hand, I help her.” There is no room for downtime or holidays. “People might think we’re mad but it’s the way we’ve always done it,” Ann says. “Luckily, neither of us is bothered. Racing’s our holiday, and we’ll be dying to get back after Cheltenham on Wednesday.” Their desperation to be at home with their horses and livestock faced a serious challenge last November, when Storm Arwen swept across the country. “We’d hired a minibus to take the whole family to Newcastle the night before the Fighting Fifth,” Ian says, “because Ann was getting an award for trainer of the year. We went back to a friend about six miles away, and borrowed a quad bike off them to get back. Trees were down all over, it took us two hours to do six miles.” Ann admits: “We shouldn’t have done it, but we were just so worried about everything at home.” The horse that could take their season’s earnings close to half a million pounds at Cheltenham next week has a box in a converted cow shed behind the farmhouse. Tommy’s Oscar has won his last four starts, working his way through handicaps to take the Grade Two Champion Hurdle Trial at Haydock Park last time out, and while Honeysuckle, the defending champion and odds-on favourite, is a fresh and very daunting opponent, they are in no mood to back away now. Ann says: “I’ve only had one runner at the Festival before, and I swore I’d never go back.” Ian continues: “It was all the people and noise, he didn’t eat or settle and this one might not either, it’s a funny thing going away overnight. It’s the hill and crowd that’s worrying us.” Even a fairytale win for Tommy’s Oscar in the Champion Hurdle itself, however, would not change the way they do things on the family farm. “Ann’s had any amount of opportunities to train horses for anybody, but she’ll not do it,” Ian says. “She says she’s got one twisty owner and she doesn’t need any more.”",Sport/Sport,Hamiltons take homegrown story of National Hunt season to Cheltenham,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/hamiltons-take-homegrown-story-of-national-hunt-season-to-cheltenham
3/12/2022,"Children are going missing and cases of human trafficking are being reported by aid groups and volunteers along Ukraine’s borders amid the chaos of the refugee crisis triggered by the Russian invasion. Charities and rights groups working in neighbouring countries to receive refugees said they had seen cases of trafficking, missing children, extortion and exploitation as more than 2.5 million people crossed into neighbouring countries to escape the escalating violence. Karolina Wierzbińska a coordinator from Homo Faber, a human rights organisation based in Lublin, Poland, said the charity had seen cases of children being sent alone by desperate parents to meet relatives or friends across the Ukrainian border and arriving without anyone to meet them. “This is obviously extremely distressing for a child and can lead to them wandering around the station alone, disoriented and in the worst-case scenario, disappearing altogether. This, unfortunately, is not a hypothetical case – it has happened already,” she said. “We are also already getting reports of cases of human trafficking and women being offered work in Poland only to find the workplace is illegitimate, the employer is mistreating them, refusing to pay their salary on time. There are cases of extortion of personal documents or money.” Homo Faber has been working at all four border crossing points to mitigate the risks and has set up a 24-hour helpline, operated by Ukrainian speaking volunteers trained to support women and children crossing the border. “We feel strongly that information should reach women before they cross into Poland,” Wierzbińska said. “These are people dealing with serious trauma. The amount of conflicting information, decisions to be made – the sheer volume of stimuli can lead to a cognitive overload. The sooner they are made aware of the situation awaiting them in Poland, the more time they have to process it.” At nearly every train station near border crossings, crowds of people, often men, hold cardboard signs offering refugees lifts to destinations across Europe. Wierzbińska said it was impossible to vet every person offering to drive refugees to friends or family before they picked people up. “I would guess that 90% of those men were well-meaning people offering genuine help. Nevertheless, the situation itself was extremely chaotic, potentially frightening for anyone, let alone a person already in distress. We cannot rule out that a fraction of the people in the crowd were simply criminals, waiting to take advantage of vulnerable women,” she said. Polish border guards have been helping to distribute the organisation’s leaflets, which detail how to keep personal documents safe, how to prepare for travelling through busy train stations with children and what to do if someone offers you a ride but changes the destination during the journey. At the Slovakian border crossing in Vyšné Nemecké, volunteers said, in theory, people offering refugees lifts must present their ID and car number plates on arrival before being permitted to take anyone from the border. In reality, this was impossible to do in every case. Monika Molnárová, from Caritas Slovakia’s stop human trafficking team, said Slovakia’s national unit for combatting human trafficking was working at the border and had intervened to protect women and children in suspected cases. “The risk of trafficking is considerable, as the refugees, exhausted and deprived of any basic comfort, are, with every new day on the road, more and more vulnerable. We believe traffickers and recruiters are most probably targeting both women travelling alone and women travelling with children,” she said. At a temporary camp for refugees near the border, run by Slovakian authorities, camp manager Sergej Savin said that they did not allow ad hoc transportation of people from the site. He added that there had been people who had turned up offering rides. “In some cases, it was not good. For example, there was a man, he wanted only one woman and four children. I told him to go. We cannot do this like that,” he said. On Tuesday, due to concerns around human trafficking, the Polish government introduced amendments to a newly passed bill, which outlines Poland’s responses to the refugee crisis, Polish Press Agency reported. The amendment raised the minimum sentence for human trafficking from three to 10 years, and the maximum prison sentence for sex trafficking of children from 10 to 25 years. Poland’s deputy interior minister, Maciej Wąsik, said: “We want to send a clear message to the criminals who are trying to exploit the tragedies of the refugees.” Unicef, the UN children’s agency, said that while the Polish government’s decision to open the border so completely to Ukrainian refugees was to be applauded, “it does present challenges” in terms of child protection. Usually the UN would register refugees at the border and identify vulnerable people such as unaccompanied children. “Now, obviously, because of the sheer scale of the numbers who are coming over, and the fact that the borders are effectively just open, this isn’t happening, which makes it incredibly difficult to identify children who are unaccompanied and separated,” said Joe English, a Unicef spokesperson. He said that the agency was setting up a system of ‘blue dot’ safe spaces for children in seven countries receiving refugees.

3/12/2022,"I’m obsessed with skin barrier and believe strongly that it’s impossible to have great-looking skin when this natural, watertight seal is compromised. This happens easily if you’ve exfoliated too zealously, overused strong actives such as retinol, been exposed to the elements without protection, worn medical PPE day after day, or been unwell (a compromised barrier as a result of having Covid seems common – my own was trashed). A damaged barrier can no longer hang on to the good stuff like fatty acids, cholesterol and ceramides, so skin is left rough, dehydrated, sometimes sensitive, and flat looking (a dull complexion is very often the result of a too-robust approach to tackling skin dullness). Thankfully, the beauty industry is finally taking an interest in the barrier, and I’m hoping this more than a marketing fad. Admittedly, to see the skincare industry exalting barrier protection after years of peddling ingredients that damage it feels a bit like being invited to kick yourself in the head then buy a packet of paracetamol, but no matter – I’ll take it and shush. Glossier, La Roche Posay, Dr Jart and new barrier-dedicated brand Byoma (an affordable skincare range devised by the team behind the excellent Tan-Luxe) are all now focusing heavily on barrier repair and offer many lovely, fatty, cushiony products that can help a great deal. Look out for barrier-loving ingredients such as ceramides, allantoin, niacinamide, linoleum acid, probiotics, glycerin and hyaluronic acid – all will help treat and restore healthy function. But search for them first in products you already have, because what I don’t want you to think is that you need to buy new ones in the name of your barrier. This is about doing less, not more, and about understanding that, usually, good barrier care is simply about applying greater kindness and restraint when it comes to your body’s largest organ. In practical and realistic terms, that means using a nightly retinol that feels comfortable, not like volcanic lava. An exfoliant that does a good-enough job twice a week, or a milder one for daily use that doesn’t cause you to brace yourself first. It means applying an antioxidant and sunscreen and pulling away from any product with sharp shards and scratchy grains (use on your body only, or bin). It means moisturising well, even if you think you don’t need it, and avoiding picking and scratching your face. You need not shed a dime.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Stop nuking your skin and its natural barrier will function fine | Sali Hughes,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/12/stop-nuking-your-skin-and-its-natural-barrier-will-function-fine
3/12/2022,"To those of us already signed up for a veritable bouquet of streaming services – all with monthly subscription fees that are modest individually and unexpectedly hefty as a collective – the announcement of a new one increasingly prompts some stringent decision-making. Does this one offer you something substantial you don’t get from those ones? Which one can you live without to make room for a newcomer? Or are you willing to simply add it to the growing pile? With all this in mind, StudioCanal’s new platform, StudioCanal Presents, has a stronger selling point than most. In its 34-year history, the Paris-based distributor and production company has built up one of the largest film libraries in the world, digging into the vaults of everything from Ealing Studios to Studio Ghibli. StudioCanal Presents, available for £4.99 via the Apple TV app (with a week-long free trial for the wary), has been built to show off those wares. It launched recently with a selection of more than 100 titles from its library, with more to be added on a monthly basis, many of them exclusive to the platform. Its starter pack, as it were, is a pretty indicative cross-section of what its archive has to offer, spanning crowdpleasers and art films, classics and newer favourites, with British and French cinema – per the company’s origins – particularly well represented in the international mix. StudioCanal’s selection of British classics includes plenty of rightly canonised titles: the eternally jittery, shivery noir of Carol Reed’s The Third Man, the foxy comedy of Ealing stalwarts Kind Hearts and Coronets and The Ladykillers, the still-startling candour of Ken Loach’s debut feature, Poor Cow, or the nervy, sensual modernism of Nicolas Roeg’s endlessly imitated psychological horror Don’t Look Now. But I was pleased to find a few films that aren’t celebrated today as much as they deserve to be. Bryan Forbes’s lovely, quietly compassionate 1962 adaptation of Lynne Reid Banks’s The L-Shaped Room, about a young pregnant Frenchwoman seeking allies in a west London boarding house, still rings perceptively true in its depiction of the mixed messages Britain gives to new arrivals. From the same era of new British realism, Guy Green’s The Angry Silence probes labour politics and working-class financial despair with a determined vigour – interpreted as anti-strike in its day – that could still prompt debate now. Moving away from realism entirely, there’s rainy-Sunday teatime escapism in the lavishly camp, star-encrusted 1970s version of Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile, should you want a corrective to the wooden Kenneth Branagh take currently in cinemas. Crossing the Channel, the French New Wave gets a look-in, with Jean-Luc Godard’s form-changing Breathless, René Clément’s icy yet sun-scorched Ripley tale Purple Noon and Alain Resnais’s dreamily deconstructed romance Last Year at Marienbad among the selections. At the more recent end of French culture, the compulsive, suitably twisty policier series Spiral is a highlight of the platform’s TV selection, along with the louche, bespoke-tailored nastiness of Hannibal, the 2013 Hannibal Lecter origin series with an ideally cast Mads Mikkelsen, well worth bingeing for the first or 14th time. Latter-day cinema selections range from the brash gangster spectacle of Tom Hardy’s dual Kray brothers performance in Legend to Steven Soderbergh’s underrated, southern-fried heist romp Logan Lucky to the perverse, tar-dark Korean woman-on-a-mission mystery of Bong Joon-ho’s Mother – every bit the equal of the director’s more popular Parasite. And should you somehow have missed two of the essential American films of the past decade – the Coen brothers’ wintry, elegiac folk throwback Inside Llewyn Davis and Todd Haynes’s all-time romantic swoon Carol – a double feature of those is worth the month’s fiver already. Human Rights Watch film festivalThe travelling international festival of progressive, socially conscious cinema holds its London edition from 17-25 March, with the entire programme also available to stream digitally in the UK and Ireland during that time. It’s a fresh, exciting selection of documentary and narrative work: highlights include the recently Berlin-awarded Myanmar Diaries – an urgent, searing journal by anonymous film-makers of the past year under military rule – and Eternal Spring, an inspired mixed-media reflection on Chinese police persecution of Falun Gong activists, its lively animation drawn from the comic-book aesthetic of exiled artist Daxiong. La Civil(Signature)When her teenage daughter is kidnapped by a cartel and the authorities in northern Mexico prove no help, single mother Cielo takes matters into her own hands.

3/12/2022,"There have in the past been casual mentions in Asian football of how Russia would be welcome in the confederation to really give the continent a sense of geographical completeness. This addition would mean a different conversation now but in the meantime if Moscow wants to see what football life can be like under sanctions then a visit to famous Asian cities such as Tehran, Pyongyang and Yangon would be timely. The Iranian Football Federation has been wrestling with US-imposed restrictions for years, even if they are not as strict as the measures taken against Russia. Sanctions made headlines before the 2018 World Cup when Nike found itself unable to supply the team with boots, but there are more serious consequences. Swift, the financial system that enables money to move smoothly between international accounts, has been denied to Russian banks. Iran have had problems receiving their payments from Fifa and the Asian Football Confederation. In December 2019, Iran’s sport minister, Masoud Soltanifar, blamed this for the then national team coach, Marc Wilmots, getting paid late. “Unfortunately, due to unfair sanctions, Fifa cannot pay Iran’s revenues without the permission of the US Department of the Treasury and the Iranian federation was forced to borrow money from a domestic company to pay the salary of the national team head coach,” he said. Other foreign coaches and players have left due to similar problems. Being on the international naughty step has also made it harder to attract decent international opposition to Tehran for friendlies and harder for Iran to pay for much-needed training camps overseas. Internationally, things may not look too bad with the national team having qualified for a third World Cup in succession with games to spare but, domestically, there are major problems of which sanctions may not be the cause but do make finding solutions more difficult. The two biggest clubs in the country, debt-ridden Persepolis and Esteghlal, were thrown out of the 2022 Asian Champions League in January for both being owned by the Ministry of Youth and Sport. There has been talk and promises of privatisation for years but there is just no money in Iranian football to attract investors even if there was the political will to relinquish control of such popular institutions. The national broadcast revenue of about £3.5m is spread across the whole league, as well as other sports. It is no surprise that club officials lament the difficulty of receiving transfer fees for players, the development of which is still a strength of Iran. North Korea are no strangers to isolation and, as the decision to withdraw from 2022 World Cup qualification shows, have been known to sanction themselves. They have forged their own path that lies between the desire for a form of football juche, or self-sufficiency, and the recognition that there has to be at least some outside engagement. After three defeats at the 2010 World Cup, the upper echelons of the party took a closer interest and decided that more exposure to the global game was needed. The Pyongyang International Football School was opened soon after with coaches imported from Spain. The students were hand-picked from schools around the country and those who continued to impress in the capital were sent to academies in Italy and Spain. The best of the bunch that won the 2014 Asia Under-16 Championship was Han Kwang-song. He went on to play for Cagliari, Perugia and, for a short time, Juventus, before being sold to Al-Duhail of Qatar. The North Korean Ronaldo’s international career was derailed, however, amid reports that much of his salary was being sent back to the government in Pyongyang, in contravention of UN sanctions. The same thing ended Choe Song-hyok’s time with Fiorentina in 2016. Myanmar do not have such problems of players earning big bucks overseas. Since last year’s military coup, there is not that much football to speak of with many players reportedly returning to their home provinces to get ready to fight the junta. Football leaders do know plenty about sanctions, with their FA chief, Zaw Zaw, specifically targeted by the European Union in the last decade. The Yangon United owner, U Tay Za, has been similarly hit, including by the UK government last September for, among other things, supplying weapons to the military. The tycoon’s bottom line has been affected, which leaves little for football. There were attempts to attract Chinese investment but this is a time when Beijing looks much less favourably than before on money leaving the country to line the pockets of foreign players, agents and clubs, though at least Tay Za was thankful for his Chinese-made smartphone that helped him survive a 2011 helicopter crash when he was stranded for four days at an altitude of 15,000 feet. Russian football officials are unlikely to face such drama but, in the absence of a move to Asia, the day-to-day challenges of operating when it is hard to collect money and play games should be enough to be going on with.",Sport/Football,Lessons from Asia’s outcasts: how isolation could hit Russian football | John Duerden,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/12/lessons-from-asia-outcasts-how-isolation-could-hit-russian-football
3/12/2022,"“We had a plan for when the war started,” says Bogdan Nesvit, the 30-year-old co-founder of Ukrainian tech developer Holy Water. “We relocated the female part of the team to Poland. With men not allowed to leave the country, we are all working between bomb shelters and hotels.” Nesvit is now sharing a hotel room with six of his 80 colleagues in western Ukraine (“It is like a dorm”). He is one of the country’s army of almost 300,000 tech workers who have embarked on an unprecedented migration to keep their businesses running during the Russian invasion. The hotel where he is now based has turned its gym into a makeshift communal office space – Nesvit estimates it is being used by around 100 workers around the clock – as the relative safety of the west of Ukraine has made it the focus of relocation plans put into play by domestic and international businesses. Nesvit’s well-rehearsed evacuation – buses were pre-booked to leave from the company’s offices in Kyiv, which served as a rally point for staff and family members as soon as war broke out – is typical of plans put into action by Ukraine’s 8,700 IT-focused companies in cities across the country. Ukraine’s tech industry is a $6.8bn juggernaut that has more than tripled in size since 2016, with 25,000 new graduates joining the ranks of workers annually. It is overwhelmingly young – 80% are aged 18 to 32 years old – and had aimed to grow to as much as $16.3bn by 2025 before the outbreak of war. And it is fighting back. Nesvit is a prime example. He used to live in London, studied at Oxford and then University College London (UCL), and worked for the UN in New York and British American Tobacco in London and Ukraine before setting up his own business. “Ukraine is one of the best countries in the world in terms of technical talent, cost and quality of living,” he said. “Salaries in the Ukraine and US are hugely different, but the talent is of the same skill level. It is a shame the war is happening as the IT industry here is growing so fast.” The industry has been on a war footing since Russia took control of Crimea and stirred conflict in the Donbas in 2014. These so-called “business continuation plans” were dusted off when Putin launched his “peace-keeping” incursion into the east of Ukraine as a precursor to a full invasion. Sensing the threat, the IT Ukraine Association tested the sector’s readiness at the start of February with a survey question that would be unthinkable coming from a trade body in most countries: “Does your company have an emergency response plan for such cases as large-scale combat operations, lack of internet access, power outage etc?” More than 90% said they already had, or were developing, plans to keep Ukraine’s tech sector able to continue to service domestic and international clients. “It is about measures and actions to protect and make operations safe and able to continue,” says Konstantin Vasyuk, the association’s executive director. “Relocating vulnerable workers, ensuring data is in the cloud, alternative internet connections, transferring staff and specialists to western parts of Ukraine and countries in Europe. Things that can, and have, to be implemented very fast.” And so far, the plans to maintain digital resilience have helped defy expectations about the level of disruption expected from the full-scale invasion by Russian forces. Tech consultancy Star, which employs about 600 of its 1,000 global workforce in Ukraine and counts blue chip firms such as Lufthansa, Toyota and WPP as clients, says it is running at 60% of pre-war levels. “We hadn’t expected operations to stay at anything like that level,” says Star founder Juha Christensen, the former senior Microsoft executive who also founded software company Symbian and is current chair of Bang & Olufsen. “It has been one of the real surprises.” Christensen says that the approach taken by the company, which paid staff two months’ salary in advance of the invasion in case the banking system was hit, was partially inspired by Israeli companies which, given local tensions, always have contingency plans in place. He says that 18% of its Ukrainian workforce has moved to Poland and Germany, mostly the female employees, a further 49% are scattered through western Ukraine, and a third remain in Kyiv and central Ukraine, “mostly by choice”. In addition to employees, Star has relocated about 2,000 family members into western Ukraine, Poland and some into Germany. About a dozen staff have chosen to join the military effort. “We are going out of our way to make everything voluntary, including whether or not you continue to work on client projects,” says Christensen, who has turned over a house he owns in Germany for use by refugees. “Kyiv is a large city, about half the size of London in population, and probably square kilometres too, and there are some that live in safer neighbourhoods and have an infrastructure around them. It is a big decision to get up and move, and a lot of patriotic people don’t want to move.” Nazar Sheremeta, solutions architect for CloudMade, a joint venture between Star and French conglomerate Valeo, has decided to stay in Kyiv, effectively waging what has become akin to a form of internationally-backed corporate resistance across the country, with workers refusing to allow their businesses to capitulate in the face of the invasion. “I want to help as much as possible in retaining our customers, since financial stability of the company affects my financial stability, which is hugely important in such times,” he said in a message to the London-based chief executive of CloudMade, who reassured him that the company has “strong support” from its biggest client with “no indication that will change”. Sheremeta’s sentiments were echoed time and again by companies the Guardian spoke to, but he also gave insight to the mounting mental pressure of trying to work while being at war. “I am trying to distract myself with working matters as much as possible,” he explains in another message. “Otherwise you are simply looking into the news 24/7, and your nerves end out spiralling out of control. Obviously, I am also monitoring mental health to not burn out people too much right now.” Sheremeta signs off with a touchingly optimistic and defiant tone. “Hopefully this is just a minor set back, and we could achieve some stability once again,” he says, ending with a half-quip. “Preferably with Russian surrender of course.” While the idea of the vast Russian army surrendering may be fanciful, it is clear that the invasion has not gone according to plan – with Ukraine’s IT army playing its role. Alexandra Ganzha works for Ukrainian-based IT company Obrio, which has found itself based in Poland after most staff were abroad on a corporate holiday when the war started. He says most workers now operate on three shifts: working on client projects, helping friends and relatives, and volunteering. The latter spans the spectrum from finding food sources to sharing news on where to find clean water, driving trucks, sharing petrol and relocating people. It also includes turning IT skills to cyber guerrilla warfare. “We have a fair portion of our people with PhDs in data science, machine learning and of course cyber security, so a fair number are trying to do everything they can to help out,” says Christensen, who next week is relocating to a Star delivery centre in Poland that now serves as a base of operations and link to Ukraine. “Guerrilla warfare can be very effective. Lots of little projects can add pressure. It goes way beyond distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks on systems.” The digital resistance ranges from soft-power tasks such as attempting to influence public opinion in Russia via social media, raising funds for the war effort (Nesvit has raised more than $40,000 by selling NFTs – non-fungible tokens – of charity works by more than 200 Ukrainian artists), and direct hacking of systems by joining groups such as Anonymous. “Not everyone is good with a gun,” says the IT Ukrainian Association’s Vasyuk. “People should be used as efficiently as they can. We are fighting with guns, with laptops, we will keep on going.”",News/World news,Keyboard warriors: Ukraine’s IT army switches to war footing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/12/keyboard-warriors-ukraines-it-army-switches-to-war-footing
3/12/2022,"The shadow energy secretary, Ed Miliband, has warned Boris Johnson against caving in to climate sceptics on the Conservative backbenches, after No 10 appeared to open the door to fracking. As the government reviews its energy strategy after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the prime minister’s spokesperson said this week that “all options” were under consideration, making clear that included the practice of fracking. Writing in the Guardian, Miliband warns against “doubling down on fossil fuels through a fracking-style dash for gas, which some on the Conservative benches are proposing”, and calls instead for a “clean energy sprint” towards renewables. “We don’t have time for more of the government’s ideologically driven failure, nor their failure to take on the deniers on their backbenches. They play the climate hokey-cokey and we end up with climate delay,” he said. Johnson has promised to publish an energy independence plan, setting out the government’s approach to phasing out imports of Russian oil – and potentially gas. It is expected to include a focus on renewables, nuclear power and North Sea gas. At prime minister’s questions this week Johnson said the plan would appear “in the course of the next few days”, but government sources now suggest it may come after the chancellor’s spring statement on 23 March. The Net Zero Scrutiny Group of Conservative MPs, chaired by Craig Mackinlay, has been increasingly vocal in challenging the government’s green policies. The group recently called for the removal of VAT on fuel bills and the green levies paid by households, as well as the resumption of fracking in the face of rapidly increasing oil and gas prices. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, is known to be unenthusiastic about fracking, but said on Wednesday he had agreed with the prime minister that it did not make sense to concrete over fracking wells in Lancashire operated by the energy firm Cuadrilla, which were due to be closed. He told MPs the government’s position since 2019 had been to take “a precautionary approach that supports shale gas exploration if it can be done in a safe and sustainable way”. Miliband also called on the government to take action on “the Cinderella of this government’s energy policy: home insulation and energy efficiency”, adding “the best way of reducing our demand for fossil fuels is to reduce energy demand overall”. On Friday, the former Tory minister Rory Stewart called for “a government and civilian effort equivalent to the Covid response” to cut energy demand, including reducing the speed limit to 50mph and making all public transport free. Ministers have been more focused on demand in recent days, however. With imports of Russian oil due to be phased out by the end of the year, and the government looking at ending Russian gas imports, Kwarteng has met with the oil ministers of potential alternative suppliers, including Saudi Arabia. Ramping up imports from the Gulf state would be controversial, given Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s alleged role in approving the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran, said: “Britain is stuck in between a rock and a hard place because this government kicked the can down the road when it came to securing homegrown energy. If Boris Johnson is forced to cosy up to Saudi Arabia for more oil he will only have himself to blame. “By cutting support for domestic renewable energy the government is now forced to go begging around the world for more tainted oil.”",News/Environment,"No 10 must not cave in to Tory climate sceptics on fracking, says Ed Miliband",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/12/no-10-must-not-cave-in-to-tory-climate-sceptics-on-fracking-says-ed-miliband

She’s tired of the inevitable question people ask her whenever they discover her husband Martin died of Covid early in the pandemic aged 44: did he have an underlying health condition? He didn’t, as it happens, but why do they have to be so insensitive? She’s tired of the conspiracy theories and fabrications. “One person commented my husband didn’t die of Covid, the hospital was paid to lie to me to inflate the numbers. How could someone say that to a widow who was grieving?” She’s tired of the thought that her husband, a frontline health worker who died in April 2020, has been all but forgotten. He gave his life serving his patients in a New Jersey hospital like a soldier who falls in battle, leaving her to care alone for their two-year-old son Graeme and three-year-old daughter Elsie, but where is the recognition? All of this negativity frustrates and saddens her. She set up a group for young widows and widowers of Covid-19 so that others could share their experiences, and they all say the same things. “We talk about how ignored we feel, how our kids are the forgotten grievers. People keep saying this disease is not so serious. But it is. It has killed almost a million people.” Two years ago Sars-Cov-2 penetrated the United States, tentatively at first and then with a terrifying roar. On 11 March 2020 the World Health Organization declared Covid a pandemic, and two days later Donald Trump announced a national emergency, adding the memorable disclaimer: “I don’t take responsibility at all.” Now two years into the global pandemic, hope is in the air that the US might finally be turning the corner. The Omicron surge is abating, mask mandates are being scrapped and vaccination requirements lifted even in Democratic states where public safety stances have been most stringent. Music festivals are being planned this summer with no Covid restrictions. But the more the Covid cloud appears to be clearing, the more it becomes apparent that the consequences of the virus are likely to stick around. As Addison said, it’s hard to put behind you a disease that has killed almost 1 million people in America alone. Ashton Verdery, a sociologist at Pennsylvania state university, created with colleagues a bereavement multiplier that estimates how many people in the US have lost a close relative to Covid. Given the paucity of historical demographic data for Hispanic and Asian Americans, they based their calculations on population statistics for white and Black Americans though they are confident their conclusions apply broadly to all US residents. Verdery was taken aback by the findings. The number affected by Covid bereavement was much larger than he had expected. Verdery and the team concluded that for every person who dies of Covid in the US there are almost nine people in their immediate kinship group left bereaved. For every grandparent who dies there are on average four grandchildren mourning them, every parent two children, every sibling two brothers or sisters left behind. That amounts to a total pool of Covid bereaved people in the US of about 8.5 million, including almost 4 million Americans who have lost a grandparent and more than 2 million who are grieving the loss of a parent. Verdery told the Guardian that he had been particularly struck by the large numbers of people who lost a grandparent. “Many children will remember for the rest of their lives that they lost a grandparent in the pandemic.” The implications are especially acute when children lose a parent – a position that now applies to more than 200,000 under-18s. “That’s going to have big consequences,” Verdery said. “Children who lose a parent have a greater likelihood of dropping out of school, not attending college, criminal justice involvement, lower earnings and higher mortality in later life.” The US could conceivably be turning the corner on the pandemic, but not if you are one of the many people suffering post-coronavirus symptoms known as long Covid. There is so much we don’t know about long Covid, not least how many of the almost 80 million people in the US who have been infected with the virus are suffering the most common symptoms of prolonged disease – tiredness, breathing problems, joint or muscle pain, and difficulties with concentrating. Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego, said that the number of US residents suffering enduring problems is likely to be more than 10 million. Some of his medical colleagues who contracted the virus in the early days of the pandemic are still very debilitated, he said. “This is going to be one of the lingering profound results. We are in the dark, we have no idea where this will end. We have no treatment that is effective, and there’s been not nearly enough given the millions of people adversely affected.” For Topol, the story of the past two years has been that of the extremes of American capability. On the one hand, there is the story of the lightning-fast development of vaccines, which he calls “historic, momentous, the greatest biomedical triumph yet”. A timeline he put together on his Twitter feed makes the point. The Sars-Cov-2 virus was genetically sequenced on 10 January 2020 – two months before Trump announced his “no-responsibility” national emergency. Five days later the first mRNA vaccine was designed by the US National Institutes of Health in partnership with Moderna. Two months after that a trial began of a vaccine that has proven to be remarkably resilient at withstanding the mutational dexterity of this virulent disease. Compared with this unparalleled example of scientific speed and ingenuity, Topol despairs at how the vaccines and boosters have been put to use. Or not put to use. “We botched the whole booster program in the US,” he said. Americans have taken up booster shots at a dramatically lower level than other wealthier countries despite the relative ease with which they can be obtained. The latest estimate from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) is that booster coverage is as low as 42%. Expressed as a league table of countries, the US now ranks 67th for the proportion of its population that is fully vaccinated and 54th for boosters. “We should see those rankings and have a sense of blatant failure,” Topol said. “We had reasons to be the leader in vaccine use and yet we slumped into being a world laggard.” The consequences of that failure continue to be felt in the US despite the leavening mood. Thousands of Americans are still dying each week, deaths which Topol believes are almost entirely preventable given the efficacy of boosters at mitigating the deadliness of the virus. He sees the continuing costs of failure too in the burnout within his profession. “Colleagues are going for early retirement because they can’t take it any more, people are changing careers, we’re losing nurses. It’s palpable, the disenchantment. It’s not just burnout – it’s burnout squared.” As Topol suggested, the problem is especially acute among nurses. The American Nurses Association has said it expects more than half a million experienced registered nurses to retire this year, adding to a shortage projected to exceed 1 million. That leaves a healthcare system whose flaws have been amply displayed during the pandemic even more vulnerable should the virus mutate again into a new aggressive variant. Danielle Allen, a Harvard professor and national policy leader on the Covid response, told the Guardian that the pandemic has exposed other fundamental fault-lines that have been festering in American society for the past 50 years. In her new book, Democracy in the Time of Coronavirus, she explores how the country’s flailing approach was in significant part rooted in its gaping wealth inequality. She notes how at the start of the pandemic affluent Americans retreated to their vacation homes and Zoom bubbles, “much as ancient Romans and early modern British aristocrats used to retreat to villas and country estates in the face of plague”. Meanwhile, low-income workers in essential frontline jobs – large proportions of whom were African American and Hispanic – were forced to turn up for work in person, prompting Covid case and death rates to match. That core disparity is reflected in the latest statistics. KFF reports that two years on the racial gulf in Covid experiences remains huge: when data is age-adjusted it shows that Hispanic, Black, and Native American and Alaska Native people are twice as likely to die from Covid as their white counterparts. “The pandemic has been an X-ray on who holds power and the vast separation between those elites and everybody else,” Allen said. Allen recalls vividly the initial shock of the pandemic as it swooped down on her community. “It felt like falling off a cliff with no bungee cord. There was a plunge into hunger, and we had one of the highest mortality rates in the country among older people even though we have one of the crown jewels of biotech right here in Massachusetts.” That dichotomy spoke volumes to her. “We were one of the richest states in the richest country in the world – and people felt abandoned.” Abandoned. That’s the word that Allen kept hearing from people describing their plight. It leads her to draw a highly sobering conclusion in her book, that Covid taught the US a very dark truth about itself: “We don’t know, in conditions of emergency, that we will be OK together.” Too many people, she argues, “were willing to abandon our elders” to the virus. Too many people were willing to abandon essential workers, young people, people of colour, rural Americans. For Allen, hard questions hang in the air even as the pall of the pandemic dissipates. The hardest question of all is stated bluntly in her book. “If, in conditions of emergency, we cannot count on support from one another, then how do the institutions we share together have any legitimacy?” That’s another potential long-term legacy of the virus in the US – its impact on democratic institutions. Around the first anniversary of the pandemic Ashley Quarcoo, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Endowment, assessed the situation and came up with some reasons to be cheerful. In an article for the Council on Foreign Relations she pointed to new methods of voting, particularly voting by mail, that contributed to a historic turnout in the 2020 presidential election. She also highlighted the eruption of new forms of civic activism that reached a peak in the summer of protests following the police murder of George Floyd. “There may be a silver lining that could strengthen US democracy in the longer-term,” she wrote then. What a difference a year can make. The Guardian went to Quarcoo and asked her whether, on the second anniversary of the pandemic, she was still optimistic. “There’s been a backlash to the huge election turnout in 2020, with many states passing laws to restrict voting by mail,” she said. “There’s also been a decline in confidence about our election integrity provoked by Donald Trump’s claims of election fraud.” She still sees residues of the collective activism that the pandemic helped unleash, but there’s less consensus around the search for solutions. “That sense of social solidarity and coming together in the summer of 2020 has given way to mistrust, both about how things work and between citizen and citizen.” As America scrambles to get back to a “normal” that perhaps never existed, Quarcoo warns that the wounds of these brutal two years run deep. “The social fabric of the US is more brittle, fissures are more deeply exposed and starkly clarified.” That poses a challenge, she said.

3/12/2022,"At this perilous moment, we are faced with three interlocking energy crises. An energy security crisis, with the invasion of Ukraine demonstrating to Europe that it must wean itself off Russian gas and oil, and quickly. A price crisis of soaring, sky-high bills. And the climate crisis, which the UN warned just last month is even more advanced and dangerous than we thought. Some will say we cannot confront all three together. There are voices on the right of politics already growing louder, saying it’s necessary to sacrifice or slow down our climate ambitions so we can lock in energy security. But they are profoundly wrong. Doubling down on fossil fuels, for example, through a fracking-style dash for gas which some on the Conservative benches are proposing, would be a disastrous response to each of these crises. For starters, what is the quickest way to get us off Russian gas and allow us control over our own energy supply? By pressing ahead with building the 649 onshore wind and solar projects that already have planning permission in the UK. They could come on stream within two years and would fully replace Russian gas imports, but are being held back by the de-facto moratorium imposed by the government in 2015, when it introduced draconian planning restrictions for new windfarms and cut onshore windfarms off from investment in renewables. Fracking would take at least a decade to arrive, as the prime minister was warned this week by his own business secretary, and the average time between new exploration and production in the North Sea is 28 years. It’s the same story on price. The lowest-cost fuels available are now wind and solar. Even before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent gas prices spiralling further, generating energy from gas was four times more expensive than new solar or wind. And because we operate in an integrated gas market, we pay the same price for gas from domestic sources as we do for imports. Of course, the North Sea will continue to play a role as we transition to net zero, but whatever the level of our domestic supply, it cannot be immune from international price shocks. Fracking was halted because it was considered too dangerous by Conservative ministers. And on climate, the case the UK made at Cop26 was that the world needed to get off fossil fuels. That is indeed the central challenge of net zero. The idea that reverting to business as usual is somehow consistent with tackling the climate crisis is therefore nonsense. There is only one way to meet all three crises of security, price and climate together: to not slow down on the drive towards zero carbon, but to turn the current saunter into a sprint. It is time to finally take seriously the Cinderella of this government’s energy policy, which is home insulation and energy efficiency – because the best way of reducing our demand for fossil fuels is to reduce energy demand overall. Upgrading the 19m cold, draughty British homes would cut energy bills by an average of £400 every year and our gas imports by 15%. But home insulation rates have plummeted over the past decade, and emissions from buildings are as high now as they were in 2015. We need to push further and faster on every form of renewables. Get rid of the moratorium on onshore wind. Reignite the push towards solar power that I started when I was the energy secretary, but which was stamped out by government policy in 2015. Embrace tidal power and hydrogen. Finally, nuclear power needs to play a supporting role in the energy mix. The independent Climate Change Committee says that new nuclear stations are needed to achieve our net zero targets. During my time as the energy secretary, I identified the potential sites for new nuclear plants, but 12 years on the government has not completed any new nuclear stations. We should set a clear deadline on financial close for Sizewell C. There is no mystery as to why the government has so comprehensively failed on energy efficiency: it is the product of piecemeal, outsourced and underfunded schemes. We simply cannot achieve energy efficiency and the rapid switch to heat pumps, for example, without substantial public investment. That investment – as everyone from the OBR to the IMF will tell you – is the responsible economic choice. It is why Labour has committed £6bn a year to energy efficiency over the next decade as part of our groundbreaking £28bn a year climate investment pledge. We don’t have time for more of the government’s ideologically driven failure, nor their failure to take on the deniers on their backbenches. They play the climate hokey-cokey and we end up with climate delay. Remember the onshore wind ban was put in by David Cameron in response to unhappy backbenchers. They were no doubt inspired by a guy called Boris Johnson, who said in 2013 that wind turbines wouldn’t “pull the skin off a rice pudding” and that fracking was a better answer. The same double-speak cannot be allowed to happen again on the false premise that a new dash for gas through fracking might answer today’s challenges. Fossil fuels are not the answer to a fossil fuel crisis. We need a clean energy sprint to tackle the climate crisis, the cost of living crisis, and our energy security crisis together. This is the route to national energy independence and sovereignty. Business as usual just won’t do. The safest route is to go big, go green, go bold and go fast.
