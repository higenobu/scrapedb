5/18/2022,"“By the way, Woody,” says Barry Bennell, “do you think you’re good enough to be one of my boys?” The football coach is visiting Andy Woodward’s parents’ house to recruit their son for Crewe Alexandra’s youth team, but, for us viewers, the line, like so many others in Floodlights (BBC Two), has a darker resonance. Bennell is on the hunt for new talent. He can’t stay long, he tells Jean and Terry Woodward, adding: “I’m scouting under-10s in Buxton at six o’clock.” Matt Greenhalgh’s terse, harrowing script tells Woodward’s story, in particular how what Bennell did to the boy cast its long shadow over the man. In 2018, Bennell was jailed for child sexual abuse offences against 22 boys. The number of his victims is widely believed to have run into three figures, the youngest of them eight years old. Bennell had served earlier sentences for similar crimes but this time was jailed for 34 years. This conviction was made possible by Woodward, who waived anonymity in Daniel Taylor’s 2016 Guardian interview, detailing how he was raped by Bennell during his three years in Crewe’s youth team. His testimony, as a former professional footballer for Sheffield United and Bury FC, encouraged other victims to come forward. Jonas Armstrong as Bennell plays this scene with extreme oiliness, leaning casually on the door jamb of the Woodwards’ living room as he grooms both parents and son like some diabolical Dickensian benefactor in flammable athleisurewear. The Woodwards are sunk deep in their three-piece suite as he commands the room, dangling before them possibilities of four-figure weekly pay cheques, Man U contracts and England caps. His smile reminds me of Michael Fassbender’s, his curly locks like those of Paul Usher as sinister scouser Barry Grant in Brookside. In another bitterly resonant scene in a post-match changing room, Bennell tells his pre-pubescent charges about the glorious triumphs that will be theirs if they follow his regimen, all the while taking his clothes off. His nakedness becomes an emblem of his power over the boys, and, as they exchange worried looks, suggestive that something, though they can scarcely explain what, is terribly wrong. All the child actors are terrific, but none more so than Max Fletcher as Woody, a gangly shy boy with big, angelic eyes. “It was the softer, weaker boys he targeted,” Woodward said of Bennell in his Guardian interview and, while the self-recrimination that may be behind those words makes me queasy, Fletcher’s portrayal of the young Woody as gentle and gauche bears out the remark. When we meet grown-up Woodward, it’s a shock. The angel has gone, leaving, in former Shameless star Gerard Kearns’s affecting performance, a broken and sad-eyed man. Kearns’ grief-racked face, like clouds before a Mancunian downpour, looks to be damming an ocean. The drama accelerates rather too quickly through Woodward’s post-football career. In 2003, he retired from the game early after being hobbled by the trauma Bennell visited on him. He became a police officer specialising in child protection. This development is fascinating enough, but we skate over it and find that Woodward was dismissed from the force for having an inappropriate relationship with a relative of a witness. Greenhalgh’s script spends too little time on this part of Woodward’s story and too much depicting one of his football team managers, Neil Warnock, as a bully needing anger management training. After he is dismissed from the police, we see Woodward move back in with his mum and dad. His marriage seems to be over; his life is in tatters, his worldly goods in two bin bags. One night, while he is scrolling Facebook, a friend request pops up from someone called Richard Jones. He is being cyber-stalked by his abuser. “Jones” is really Bennell, who is out of jail after one of his shorter prison terms and, the photos show, sunning himself somewhere nice. “He’s out and about enjoying life,” Woodward tells a friend just before he makes a suicide attempt. “I’m not. Not one bit. Not for ages.” Greenhalgh repeatedly focuses on Woodward’s self-abasement. “Why was I his favourite?” he keeps asking, as if there was some fact about him that made him deserve to be, as his police statement said, raped and molested, forced to watch and read hardcore pornography, forced to give and receive oral sex. Which are things nobody should endure. Nor, having been forced to do them, to feel ashamed. “I have five sons who love me, and I love them,” he tells the Guardian. “They think I’m a real man.” “Why aren’t you a real man?” asks the reporter with gentle incredulity. “Because real men don’t get raped.” I yearned for the scene to close with the reporter telling him the truth. Real men do get raped. Silent suffering only keeps such myths alive. And that’s the reason why this drama is so valuable: it breaks the silence and shame around male rape, and puts the blame where it belongs. After the end credits roll, I wonder what the real Andy Woodward looks like. I get a shock. Guardian photographer Chris Thomond’s portraits make Woodward look very different from Gerard Kearns’s interpretation of him. He looks soigné, handsome, untroubled. Let’s hope the camera doesn’t lie.

5/18/2022,"Eddie Jones has challenged Henry Arundell to earn a spot in England’s World Cup squad next year, revealing it took him five minutes to decide the 19-year-old full-back warranted a first call-up. Arundell was among the eye-catching inclusions named on Tuesday in a 36-man training squad for a three‑day camp, capping a breakthrough season at London Irish in which he has scored several remarkable tries, including a length-of-the-field effort against Toulon this month. Jones compared him to Matt Giteau – the former Australia Test centurion who the England head coach unearthed when in charge of the Wallabies – and challenged Arundell to bolt into the World Cup squad for France 2023 in the same way Nehe Milner-Skudder did for the All Blacks in 2015. They are both examples he has frequently used but it was telling to hear Jones reveal how quickly he was convinced of Arundell’s potential, having watched Irish’s draw with Wasps a few weeks ago in which he scored a dazzling try. Arundell is also eligible for Wales and Scotland but would be captured by England if he makes his full debut on the summer tour of Australia. “He has 12 months to find his feet. Remember Nehe Milner-Skudder? He came from nowhere in 2015 and that is the sort of thing a young guy can do,” Jones said. “The reason I have compared Arundell [with Giteau] is a similar story. You get reports through on young players, and where there is smoke there is usually some fire. I remember getting a report on Giteau, what he could do, and then you go and watch him play. Within five minutes you can generally work out whether he’s got it or not, whether he’s got something special. “I gave you that example of Arundell [against Wasps]. And Giteau was the same, I went to watch him play half-back for his club, and within five minutes you could tell he had something about him. “Then the hard part comes, when they’ve got to work really hard, they’ve got to not believe what’s being said about them, that they’re not kid-wonder, that they’ve got to apply themselves to the task and that’s when the real player comes through. The test of a young player to become a good Test player is their ability to work hard, their ability to take knocks, their ability to keep resilient physically and mentally and to have that mindset to keep improving. “From what I know of him, and I have met him once very briefly, he has got good attributes. But we will only see that on the three days of training we have.” With 10 uncapped players in the squad it has been picked with an eye on the England v Barbarians match on 19 June – when Premiership finalists will be unavailable – and a number of senior players including Henry Slade, Ben Youngs and Joe Marler have been rested. Sam Simmonds is injured and his club, Exeter, expect him also to miss the trip to Australia as he requires surgery on his hip. Notable selections include the prop Mako Vunipola who, as reported by the Guardian, is back in Jones’s thinking having been out of the picture all season. Jones, meanwhile, conceded there is pressure to win in Australia with the forthcoming camp drawing a line under England’s disappointing Six Nations performance. Jones took part in a formal review, conducted by the Rugby Football Union’s anonymous panel, and though he insisted it was a productive process, there was a sense he has had more enjoyable experiences during his tenure. He is due to leave the role after next year’s World Cup and all but confirmed reports he has been sounded out about joining Racing 92 in the French Top 14. “The support [from the RFU] has been first class, but my responsibility is to win,” Jones said. “In this job there’s always pressure, of course there’s pressure to win in Australia. It’s normal to be criticised, to be under fire a little bit. I don’t think you ever get used to it, to losing. It’s not a pleasant experience. But you take the positives out of the situation you have.” Of the link with Racing, he told Sky Sports: “Obviously people ask you questions and if you reply it becomes a huge story. Maybe there has been a telephone conversation. Sometimes I don’t handle those things, other people handle it for you. I’m a rugby coach and I love coaching, and I still feel like I have plenty to contribute.”",Sport/Sport,Eddie Jones urges Henry Arundell to earn place in England’s World Cup squad,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/17/eddie-jones-henry-arundell-england-rugby-world-cup-squad-2023
5/18/2022,"Good morning. Sweden and Finland will formally submit simultaneous requests to join Nato today, though Turkey maintains it will not support the applications. As the election campaign enters its final days, Labor maintains an advantage over the Coalition but the contest has tightened in Scott Morrison’s favour, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Labor has a two-point lead in the poll’s two-party preferred “plus” measure with the opposition on 48% and the Coalition on 46%. Seven per cent of respondents are undecided. A fortnight ago, Labor was ahead of the Coalition 49% to 45% with 6% undecided. So what is likely to sway voters? Surveys consistently show that aged care, climate change and education are among voters’ top concerns, but you wouldn’t necessarily know it by watching politicians’ press conferences or reading some media coverage. We also take a close look at the Victorian seat of Corangamite, lost to Labor in the last election, and the Coalition is pulling out all stops to get it back. The fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said on Tuesday they could be tried and even executed. Eight people have died and 12 wounded after Russia launched a missile strike on the village of Desna and peace talks have stalled, according to both sides. Australia has fared better than many countries throughout much of the pandemic, but despite high vaccination rates and the availability of antiviral treatments, people are still dying every day and case numbers are rising. While the new treatments offer hope, Australia must not become complacent, experts say. Now, two years into the pandemic, can Australia still say it is faring well against Covid? Australian tech company Canva has continued operating in Russia despite outrage from Ukrainians, who say Canva’s actions were “inconsistent with what we believe an ethical company’s response should have been”. Health experts are calling for voluntary mask-wearing in Victoria, as the state records more cases of the flu so far this year than the whole of 2020 and 2021 combined. There have been more than 5,000 flu infections this year, while 13,654 new Covid cases were reported on Tuesday. Signs of life are returning to Brisbane’s CBD, but small businesses have been hit hard by the pandemic, with a 15% reduction in the number of food licenses in the city over the last two years. The European Commission has raised the spectre of an economically damaging trade war with the UK, pledging to respond with “all measures at its disposal” if Liz Truss presses ahead with a plan to rewrite the Northern Ireland protocol. A China Eastern Airlines plane that crashed in March, killing 132 people, appears to have been intentionally flown into the mountainside below by someone at the controls, according to reports. Joe Biden has condemned those who spread white supremacist lies “for power, political gain and for profit” during a visit to Buffalo, New York, where 10 people were killed in a racist shooting last Saturday. For some years, Yorta Yorta man Jason Tamiru’s job was to help secure “thousands of bones, hundreds of people” from museums, institutions and private collectors around the world. As a cultural heritage officer for Indigenous nations in north-west Victoria, Tamiru would organise burial ceremonies and inter the remains back on Country. “It’s a duty, mate,” says the theatre director. “A role I took on with honour.” It is “heartbreaking” for First Nations people when their ancestors’ remains are withheld, says Tamiru, whose experiences in repatriation inform a new play, The Return, which Tamiru is directing at Melbourne’s Malthouse theatre as part of the Rising festival. Liane Moriarty is hot property. Screen rights to all nine of her novels have sold – Big Little Lies was given the HBO treatment in 2017, Nine Perfect Strangers became a miniseries in 2021 and several more adaptations are on the way, with A-listers like Nicole Kidman and Blake Lively optioning the remainder of Moriarty’s back catalogue. To keep the page-turners coming, Moriarty commits to writing a new novel every two years (or so). The trick to staying on schedule is an hourglass that she keeps on her desk. She tells us about the romantic appeal of that tool, as well as the story of two other important personal belongings. Remember the old friendship trope “if we’re both single when we’re older, let’s get married” seen in films like My Best Friend’s Wedding? The modern version of that seems to be “if we’re both homeless when we’re older, let’s live in our cars”, writes Deirdre Fidge. Or more realistically: when, not if. Most property listings begin with a description such as “A wonderful investment to add to your portfolio!” ... “A must-see for any savvy investor!” Even the language around home ownership has morphed into a complete acceptance that chances are, anyone looking to buy is already in the market. Homes are not a human right but an opportunity for investment. The rich get richer, the poor live in hatchbacks (if they have one). Home to some of the most culturally diverse communities in Australia, the seats of Reid, Parramatta and Lindsay in western Sydney are a tantalising prospect for the major parties. Traditionally Labor heartland, the demographic changes have resulted in marginal seats that can be flipped by the right candidate. So will the pitch of either of the major parties be effective this election? In today’s Full Story, Guardian Australia reporters Michael McGowan and Mostafa Rachwani talk to voters in the marginal seats about issues they care about and explain to Laura Murphy-Oates why western Sydney is the “golden goose” of the election.

5/18/2022,"Let’s do the wacky metafictional zombie film right here! That is the rationale behind this unassuming knockabout comedy-farce - in which more or less everyone gets splattered with blood and bodily fluids - from Michel Hazanavicius, chosen to open this year’s Cannes film festival, and so starting things off with some easygoing laughs. (A very bizarre experience, considering that audiences at the opening gala had just watched a live video-link address from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy, however, is a comedy veteran in his former TV showbusiness career - and might well approve.) This is in fact a remake of the cult Japanese movie One Cut of the Dead by Shin’ichirô Ueda, from 2017, and this remake is itself therefore about a remake, thus adding another metafictional level to the proceedings. The result is something appreciably sillier and more eccentric than the original, with some gags about patronising and stereotypical European attitudes to the Japanese which make it broader still, and sometimes it’s a tiny bit self-conscious in unintentional ways. It’s certainly far from the sophistication and gloss for which Hazanavicius became famous ten years ago with his silent pastiche The Artist; it’s closer to his spy spoof series OSS 117. But it’s likeable and goofy. Just as with the original film, it’s impossible not to think about the classic Michael Frayn meta-farce for the stage, Noises Off, showing in its first act a cheesy and chaotic rep play, then the backstage action in real-time explaining that the disasters we just witnessed. At first, the film appears to be about the making of a low-budget French zombie movie, which is interrupted by real zombies, brought back from the dead because the film crew has infringed an ancient local taboo. These real zombies delight the screamingly dictatorial director (Romain Duris) who wants authentic horror to galvanise his torpid cast. But his crew are horrified, particularly his assistant (Bérénice Bejo). But wait. Why do these French people have Japanese names? Why is the acting so strange, and what’s with the final wobbly crane shot? The answer is that this is supposed to be a continuous single-take movie lasting just 30 minutes, being filmed on the lowest budget imaginable: any mistakes, and they can’t just go back to first positions. They just have to improv it out. And once the curtain is lowered in this curious spectacle, flashbacks show us the bizarre compromises and negotiations that led up to this highly unlikely situation. It’s an entertaining piece of work - and a genuine oddity, ostensibly about cinema, but more about the live theatre experience. It may yet have found a way to breathe new life into the zombie genre itself.",Arts/Film,"Coupez! review – Michel Hazanavicius’s silly, splattery zombie horror meta-farce",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/may/17/coupez-review-michel-hazanaviciuss-silly-splattery-zombie-horror-meta-farce
5/18/2022,"You could be forgiven for believing that we’ve already achieved the era of autonomous vehicles. Tesla, the electric car manufacturer run by Elon Musk, refers to a version of its Autopilot software as “Full Self Driving”. The company released a (misleadingly edited) video of an autonomous vehicle navigating city streets, its drivers’ hands on their lap – a style replicated by enthusiasts. Musk has repeatedly assured in speeches and interviews that autonomous vehicles were one to two years away – or, as he put it in 2015, a “solved problem” because “we know what to do and we’ll be there in a few years.” But the existing Autopilot technology has not yet realized those promises and, as a new New York Times documentary illustrates, the gap in expectation and reality has led to several deadly crashes. Elon Musk’s Crash Course, the latest installment in the Times’s deal with FX on Hulu, is not a documentary on Elon Musk, per se. The 75-minute film from producer and director Emma Schwartz focuses specifically on Autopilot, which Musk announced in 2014 and has long billed as the key to an imminent, but as yet unreached, future of self-driving cars. As Musk, the richest man in the world, mulls taking over Twitter, the film redirects attention to longstanding problems at the company arguably most associated with his name and leadership. Through interviews with several former Tesla employees and federal regulators, the film argues that Musk oversold the capability of Autopilot, which Tesla first deployed in 2015, and dangerously lulled consumers into a false sense of security with promises of full self-driving. What do we learn from this film? The answer is nothing new if you’ve been paying attention, which is admittedly difficult due to the sheer number of Musk ventures and self-perpetuating cycles of coverage. Like the series’ previous episodes on Britney Spears’s conservatorship and the public shaming of Janet Jackson post-Nipplegate, Elon Musk’s Crash Course is more cogent synthesis and assemblage of ample archival material (Musk, we are reminded, has been building his impish genius media image for over two decades) than new investigation. The film builds around the work of two Times journalists, Cade Metz and Neal Boudette, who have reported on Musk’s grandiose visions for Tesla for years, and elucidates the troubling disconnect between Musk’s assurances and Autopilot’s actual functioning. The film opens with 911 calls from the grisly scene of Joshua Brown’s death in May 2016. A 40-year-old former military man and Tesla enthusiast, Brown was driving his Tesla Model S with Autopilot on a Florida highway when his car plowed underneath a left-turning tractor-trailer, shearing off the roof and killing him instantly. Musk and Tesla have long maintained that the company’s Autopilot system – in the fine print, a driver’s assistance system recommended for use on divided highways – makes its vehicles safer than standard cars. (Car crashes kill about 40,000 people in the US each year.) But Brown was the first of several fatal accidents involving Autopilot, bringing scrutiny to the technology’s capability and the company’s role in encouraging distracted driving. (Musk did not to respond to numerous interview requests, according to the film.) Subsequent investigations concluded that Autopilot – which at the time relied on cameras and radar but not Lidar, the system of light detection and ranging used by most other manufacturers – couldn’t differentiate between perpendicular trucks and overhead bridges. Brown’s Tesla mistook one for the other and didn’t brake, causing his death. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation into the crash ruled Tesla’s system safeguards were “lacking” and that Autopilot’s “operational design” was a contributing factor because it allowed drivers to avoid steering and to ignore the road for periods of time “inconsistent” with warnings from Tesla. The board found Autopilot operated as designed, but that the company had not adequately advised consumers on how to use it, thus fostering an “over-reliance on vehicle automation”. Three of Brown’s friends testify in the film to his enthusiasm for incipient technology and new gadgets; he wanted to be on the cutting edge of technology. The film argues that an extrapolation of that worldview at large – the belief that technology can shift global paradigms, that wildly ambitious vision can achieve seemingly impossible ends – undergirds Tesla and Musk’s approach to the controversy, which is: double down on the mission. Tesla has since abandoned radar in its Autopilot feature, instead relying solely on cameras, which Musk has long touted as the best approach, likening them to human eyes. Numerous Tesla engineers have called that approach deeply flawed or, at best, still in development. Akshat Patel, an autopilot engineering program manager at Tesla from 2014 to 2015, tells the film-makers that Tesla is using its customers in place of professional test drivers. “Elon Musk has a very specific way of motivating people,” JT Stukes, a former Tesla project engineer, says in the film. “He would say really cool things, science fiction things, and he would make you believe that you could do it.” Musk’s stature as the world’s richest man and trollish celebrity with a devout following is inextricable from his companies, and thus the film briefly skims over the building blocks of Musk’s mythos – his childhood as a bullied nerd in apartheid South Africa, starting his first company Zip2 in 1995, selling PayPal to eBay for $1.5bn and starting SpaceX in 2002, and taking over as CEO of Tesla in 2008. (Tesla’s co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who pitched the concept of an electric car company to Musk, appears in the film and testifies to Musk’s ambition.) The film understandably, as it changes by the hour, does not mention Musk’s embroiled effort to take Twitter private. There’s a brief section on the intense fandom Musk cultivates: snapshots of his tweets and a clip from his 2018 interview with divisive podcaster Joe Rogan (in which he somewhat infamously smoked a joint) act as signal flares to the online Musk skeptics, but there is no mention of his ex-wives, celebrity dating life or, you know, his secret baby with musician Grimes. The film is less analysis of Musk’s celebrity than deep dive into one troubling aspect of his career, a reminder of longstanding issues with his leadership. We have not arrived at the horizon of fully self-driving cars; we may not for several more years or, as Boudette proposes, perhaps even decades. Elon Musk’s Crash Course is not so much concerned with the heyday of autonomous vehicles as the information we have now – a counterbalance to Musk’s wild visions for the future through a sobering, tightly edited capsule of his spotty record in the present. Elon Musk’s Crash Course is available on Hulu on 20 May with a UK date to be announced",Arts/Television & radio,What can we learn from a new documentary on Elon Musk?,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/may/17/elon-musk-crash-course-documentary-tesla
5/18/2022,"Liverpool are going the distance. And so is their pursuit of the Premier League title. It is a remarkable detail of their season that they will play in every game of the four main competitions, with the Champions League final against Real Madrid on Saturday week set to be the last one. Before that – and with the domestic cups already secure – they will attempt to complete the third leg of an unprecedented quadruple. They will still need the league leaders, Manchester City, to slip up at home to Aston Villa on the final day and what a storyline that could be. City have injury problems in defence and one particular Liverpudlian will be keen to capitalise – the Villa manager, Steven Gerrard. Liverpool will have to beat Wolves at home and hope that City draw or lose but it will go to the wire after Jürgen Klopp’s team proved too strong for Southampton. Klopp rotated heavily, retaining only Alisson and Ibrahima Konaté from the lineup that had started the FA Cup final defeat of Chelsea on Saturday and, for the opening 20 minutes, struggled for their bearings. Southampton were bright and they led through Nathan Redmond. But thereafter, it was an exercise in Liverpool reeling them in. Takumi Minamino, who was on loan at Southampton last season, got the equaliser and, although Joël Matip’s winner was undercut by good fortune, it was merited on the balance of play. Klopp had been expected to make changes but perhaps not to this extent. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Sadio Mané were given the night off; Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah missed out with knocks. It was a balancing act for the manager, the calculation taking in the likelihood of City messing it up on the final day and the possibility of getting injuries ahead of the Champions League final. In the absence of a crystal ball, he backed the strength of his squad. It was game No 61 of the season for Liverpool, their third since 7 May, when Southampton had last played. The physical strain has been immense. It was about digging deeper, keeping on. Nothing else. What did Southampton have? It had not been a great deal since the beginning of March. They entered the game having taken just five points from an available 30. But they rocked Liverpool when they took an early lead. Klopp fumed on the touchline because when Lyanco started the move in the Southampton defensive third, he appeared to go through Diogo Jota to get to the ball. No foul, said the referee, Martin Atkinson. The home team worked it up the left to Redmond via Nathan Tella and it was plain what the winger had in mind. Cut inside and try the curler for the far corner. The shot got there, with the aid of a slight deflection off James Milner. Southampton’s start was impressive. They were 5-4-1 without the ball, Redmond dropping to left wing-back, Tella to left midfield, but both of them pushed up quickly when they countered. Armando Broja ran the channels. Liverpool set about repairing the damage. Roberto Firmino thought he had equalised with a header into the far corner from a Kostas Tsimikas free-kick only for the offside flag to go up late against him. Then Minamino did score. It was an explosive finish from the winger, lashed high into the near, top corner after a neat move that prised Southampton apart. Joe Gomez’s ball in from the right found Jota and his layoff ushered in Minamino. The angle was tight and Minamino’s first two touches took him a little wider. It was no problem. Alex McCarthy could only feel the heat from the finish. The remainder of the first half was all Liverpool. Milner radiated assurance from the base of the midfield while Firmino was sharp and elusive up front. Liverpool pushed higher, squeezing Southampton, dominating the ball. The home players could not find a way out, although they did largely keep their opponents at arm’s length until the interval. Milner worked McCarthy from distance and Firmino lashed a rising drive high. In between times, Firmino got on to a deflected Harvey Elliott cross but his attempted cut-back was cleared by Lyanco. Klopp lost Gomez to an injury at the end of the first half and he re-jigged for the second period; Jordan Henderson on in defensive midfield, Milner to right-back. Jota wasted a decent chance when he took a cut-back from Tsimikas and dragged wide of the far post and, with Firmino continuing to probe, Liverpool hinted at the next goal. It almost came when Firmino released Elliott but the chipped finish hit the side-netting. Klopp made an attacking move when he introduced Divock Origi for Elliott and Southampton remained on the back foot. For them, the evening had become about resilience and, when they cracked, it was galling for Ralph Hasenhüttl because Matip did not seem to know an awful lot about his header. Mohamed Elyounoussi had flicked on a Tsimikas corner and Kyle Walker-Peters seemed to head against Matip, who had his feet planted. The ball looped into the far, top corner and it is questionable whether Matip could have placed it any better.",Sport/Football,Liverpool take title race to final day after Joël Matip header sees off Southampton,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/17/southampton-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
5/18/2022,"Tory MPs are piling pressure on Rishi Sunak to take decisive action to deal with the cost of living crisis with measures such as cutting VAT, increasing energy bill support and raising benefits, as inflation is forecast to top 9% on Wednesday. A string of Conservatives from across different wings of the party called on the chancellor to intervene within weeks, amid dire economic predictions about the squeeze on households. One senior Tory, Sir Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the liaison committee that holds the prime minister to account, will warn on Wednesday that “the economic situation is far worse than the government is prepared to admit”. He is expected to highlight new figures obtained from the House of Commons library showing pensioners and the lowest income households face paying £1,000 more a year for food and energy, arguing that any help for them cannot “wait until the autumn”. “The measures that need to be looked at are £20 uplift in universal credit, transferring the cost of energy green levies to the exchequer, abolishing VAT on domestic fuel, increasing the warm homes scheme, and increasing the pensioners’ fuel allowance,” he will say. Jenkin also backed the idea of cutting VAT overall as the present inflation and tax increases are “sucking demand out of the economy”. His call for Sunak to take measures to help households were echoed by Stephen Crabb, a Tory MP and former work and pensions secretary, who said he did not “know a single Conservative colleague who isn’t acutely aware of the financial pressures facing their constituents and the need for some easing of the burden”. Writing on ConservativeHome, he warned that “both the scale of the current crisis and the speed of its impact are alarming”. He said the way to protect the most vulnerable was “finding a way to increase pension and benefit levels to a realistic level long before the next uprating is due in April 2023”. Michael Forsyth, a Conservative peer and former cabinet minister also called for the £20 uplift in universal credit to be restored, asking why the government had acted to increase the benefit during the pandemic but not when households wrestled with the current cost of living crisis. Sunak and Boris Johnson have been meeting in recent weeks to thrash out a package to help with the cost of living, but were initially insisting that any policies would not be allowed to cost money. The chancellor has repeatedly ruled out bringing in an emergency budget that would be needed for fiscal measures such as tax cuts, but is facing a revolt on the Tory benches if he fails to take major action. A source told the Guardian that officials have been examining a temporary cut to VAT similar to Alistair Darling’s action in 2008 of 2.5% or even as high as 5% but this was dismissed by Treasury sources as too expensive at around £7bn per percentage point cut and a “blunt instrument”. Experts warn that while a VAT cut would have the effect of cutting prices in the short term, it would then push up inflation whenever it is reversed. “You’re basically moving inflation from this year into what may be an election year,” said one economist. One person with knowledge of the Treasury’s thinking said: “The debate is, we’re going to have to do something for the poor; do we also need to do something for everyone?” Aside from a VAT cut, other options that would offer help across the board would include increasing the generosity of the cut in energy bills due to come into effect in October; or bringing forward the income tax cut Sunak has planned for 2024. New data from the Office for National Statistics is expected to show on Wednesday that inflation hit 9.1% in the year to April, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), as energy bills soared during the month. As the Bank of England comes under pressure over its failure to keep inflation under control, Mervyn King, the former governor, told LBC that central banks around the world including in the UK “have made serious mistakes in not acting much sooner” to raise rates. “Most people are going to be worse off because of the higher food and energy prices and there is nothing that the UK can do about that. All that we can do is try to ensure that those who are worst hit by it are protected through the benefit system,” he added. With fuel prices still high, Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, wrote to petrol retailers on Tuesday raising concerns that the chancellor’s 5p fuel duty cut “is not being passed on in any visible or meaningful way”. Speaking in a debate on cost of living in the House of Commons, a succession of Conservative MPs made it plain they expect Sunak to do something more. Conservative MP Derek Thomas said “more must be done now to help” on energy bills, while Tory MP Miriam Cates said the government should “urgently review universal credit rates”. Tory MPs are also coming round to Labour’s idea of a windfall tax, with the chancellor now leaving the door open to that as an option to raise money to help households with their energy bills.Conservative former minister Robert Halfon told MPs: “The oil bosses are earning multimillion-pound salaries and getting multimillion-pound bonuses, they are in essence in my view the new oligarchs and I would urge him to consider both a windfall tax on the oil companies which we can then use to cut taxes for the lower paid or cut energy bills, and also introduce a pump watch monitor to make sure that there is fair competition, that consumers get a fair deal at the pumps.” Speaking in the Commons, Ed Miliband, Labour shadow climate change secretary, said that a windfall tax had the backing of former Conservative leader William Hague, and claimed similar measures had been used by past chancellors including George Osborne. He added: “The truth is, they have run out of excuses, and amidst the chaos and confusion about what their position is, I think a massive U-turn is lumbering slowly over the hill. But I say this to the chancellor: swallow your pride and get on with it.” MPs are reporting a surge in their constituents struggling to deal with the cost of living crisis, while charities are increasingly sounding the alarm about dire cases of people not being able to manage. Ian Lavery, a Labour MP, told the Commons that shoplifting is on the increase as desperate people hit by the cost of living crisis are stealing “sanitary products and soap powder”. Another Labour MP, Paul Blomfield, said some people in his constituency have attempted suicide in response to the rising cost of living. One charity said on Tuesday that families struggling to cope with energy bills are seeking shelter in McDonald’s, with hard-pressed parents and children spending their evenings in the fast food restaurants, relying on the facilities as an emergency kitchen, bathroom and living room. “People are buying their kids a Happy Meal for a few quid and keeping them warm inside. Then they wash and brush their teeth in the sinks and watch television for hours on the free wifi,” said Matthew Cole, chair of the trustees of the Fuel Bank Foundation, a body which tries to help families with their bills. One of the UK’s largest food wholesalers also warned that soaring food inflation could force schools to choose between offering smaller portions at lunchtime and using cheaper ingredients. Andrew Selley, the chief executive of Bidfood, a food distribution business with an annual turnover of nearly £2bn, said schools would be facing tough decisions unless the government increased funding for free school meals.",News/Business,Rishi Sunak faces Tory clamour to act now on cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/17/rishi-sunak-faces-tory-clamour-to-act-now-on-cost-of-living-crisis
