3/8/2022,"Wars sometimes start easily, but it is a tenet of strategy that they are always unpredictable and extremely hard to end. Putin’s war of choice in Ukraine is already escalating faster than most experts would have imagined just a week ago. He has now encircled major Ukrainian cities with his army and threatens to flatten them with thermobaric weapons, cluster munitions and guided missiles. This will terrorize the civilian population and could demoralize the budding Ukrainian resistance. He could escalate the conflict to another region, such as the Balkans, where longstanding conflicts fester and Russia has an extensive network of intelligence and security services. He may turn the lights off in a major US city with a cyber-attack. Most frighteningly, he has raised the alert level of Russian nuclear forces and may be considering introducing martial law. Meanwhile, Nato, the G7 and a host of other countries have turned the dial of economic punishment up to unprecedented levels. Several European nations that had previously hesitated to involve themselves militarily in the conflict have now done so, sending weapons and financing Ukraine’s resistance. A growing number of voices in Washington are clamoring for a more aggressive approach from the United States and Nato, pressuring the White House to support a Ukrainian insurgency with a broad menu of weaponry or even calling for Nato to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. Amid this escalation, experts can spin out an infinite number of branching scenarios on how this might end. But scores of war games conducted for the US and allied governments and my own experience as the US national intelligence officer for Europe suggest that if we boil it down, there are really only two paths toward ending the war: one, continued escalation, potentially across the nuclear threshold; the other, a bitter peace imposed on a defeated Ukraine that will be extremely hard for the United States and many European allies to swallow. Putin deliberately frames his operation in Ukraine in the same way that the United States has framed its own regime-change operations in Kosovo, Iraq and Libya, charging that Ukraine has committed human rights violations and is a terrorist state. For good measure, Putin throws in the ludicrous assertion that Ukraine is fascist. These are transparent fig leaves for what is nothing more than a war of brute imperialism. Judging from how things stand now, Putin, having invested so much in this war already, seems unlikely to settle for anything less than the complete subjugation of the Ukrainian government. If the current uneven pace of Russian military progress doesn’t accomplish the job, the most likely strategy for doing this is to make an example of a city like Kharkiv, leveling it as if it were Grozny or Aleppo, both cities that Russia has brutally destroyed in the recent past, and then threatening to burn Kyiv to the ground. He can accompany this with special forces attacks in the capital to disrupt the civilian population and sow further confusion and discontent. Ultimately, he needs at least to force the removal of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and his government. In this case, Russia will install a puppet government in Kyiv, which will sign terms of surrender highly favorable to Russia. The terms will almost certainly include a pledge of Ukrainian neutrality, and might go further by committing Ukraine formally to Russia’s sphere of influence with a membership in Russia’s Collective Security Treaty Organization or its Eurasian Economic Union. At this juncture, the United States and its allies would face an extraordinarily difficult policy choice. Disgust with Putin’s war has greatly increased the chances that Washington and some of its allies would seek to fight on, for instance by supporting a Ukrainian insurgency. This would roughly mirror the strategy that the United States used to assist French resistance against Nazi Germany. The more effective Nato support to the insurgency is, the more the Kremlin would likely be willing to risk attacks on safe havens in Nato territory – most likely employing irregular forces or even the infamous Wagner Group, a private organization that operates globally as a quasi-special force of the Kremlin. These operations could lead to a massive escalation that would open the door to a much wider war between Nato and Russia – exactly the war that Joe Biden has been trying to avoid. Alternatively, the insurgency might greatly weaken Russian forces. The Ukrainian insurgent army could impose heavy damages on Russian forces and erode Putin’s position among Russian elites, on whose support he depends for power. Ukrainian forces would have major incentives to take their fight inside Russian territory, attacking Russia’s rearguard in Belarus and Russia itself. There are possible other paths toward further escalation, but they all eventually lead toward the nuclear threshold. Scores of war games carried out by the United States and its allies in the wake of Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine make it clear that Putin would probably use a nuclear weapon if he concludes that his regime is threatened. It is hard to know exactly what turn of events would scare him enough to cross the nuclear threshold. Certainly a large Nato army entering Russian territory would be enough. But what if events in Ukraine loosened his grip on power at home? Indeed, achieving regime change in Russia indirectly by making Putin lose in Ukraine seems to be the logic behind some of those who are pushing for escalation today. Moving across the nuclear threshold wouldn’t necessarily mean an immediate, full-force nuclear exchange – in other words, global thermonuclear war. But it would be an extremely dangerous, watershed event in world history. The nuclear option that has been most frequently discussed in the past few days involves Russia using a small nuclear weapon (a “non-strategic nuclear weapon”) against a specific military target in Ukraine. Such a strike might have a military purpose, such as destroying an airfield or other military target, but it would mainly be aimed at demonstrating the will to use nuclear weapons, or “escalating to de-escalate”, and scaring the west into backing down. Some analysts have questioned Russia’s ability to actually carry out such an operation, given its lack of practice. Unfortunately, this isn’t the only or even the most likely option available to the Kremlin. Based on war games I ran in the wake of Putin’s 2014 invasion, a more likely option would be a sudden nuclear test or a high-altitude nuclear detonation that damages the electrical grid over a major Ukrainian or even Nato city. Think of an explosion that makes the lights go out over Oslo. Those war games indicated that the best US response to this kind of attack would be first to demonstrate US resolve with a response in kind, aimed at a target of similar value, followed by restraint and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate. In most games, Russia still responds with a second nuclear attack, but in the games that go “well”, the United States and Russia manage to de-escalate after that, although only in circumstances where both sides have clear political off-ramps and lines of communication between Moscow and Washington have remained open. In all the other games, the world is basically destroyed. Even in the better case where both sides take their fingers off the triggers, the nuclear taboo has been broken, and we are in an entirely new era: two nuclear superpowers have used their nuclear weapons in a war. The proliferation consequences alone would be far-reaching, as other countries accelerate their nuclear weapons programs. The very fact that the nuclear taboo had been broken increases the odds that the nuclear threshold is crossed again in future conflicts, not just between Russia and America, but also with China, between India and Pakistan, in the Middle East, or elsewhere. Even this outcome in which the world is “saved”, the United States is far worse off than it was before the war in Ukraine broke out last month. What is the alternative? Once again, infinite scenarios and branches are possible, but there is a single basic one that helps to simplify thinking. It begins with an effort to avoid further escalation today. So far, the Biden administration has wisely restrained direct US military involvement in the conflict, but holding off against the rising chorus of voices pushing for escalation may be hard in the coming days if Russian forces brutally devastate Ukraine’s cities. But the most difficult challenge lies a little further down the road with the scenario described above: how to respond if Russia imposes a puppet regime in Ukraine. This would put the United States in the near-impossible position of having to choose between further escalation and compromising on the very principles that drove it toward the war in the first place – the right of a nation like Ukraine to be free and independent of subjugation to foreign rule. In this scenario, the Biden administration would have to show extraordinary leadership and strength to hold together its coalition and steer it toward restraint. It would face extremely high levels of pressure from European capitals, Ukrainian lobbies, and others to reject the puppet government and fight on, perhaps by recognizing a Ukrainian government-in-exile. The administration is already facing calls from hawkish corners of Washington to pre-empt any negotiated settlement to this war. Emotions are likely to have a much greater effect on the free democracies fighting for Ukraine than on the autocrat sitting in the Kremlin, but they will affect both sides. As they escalate, the prospects of negotiation diminish further. Would Nato’s door remain open to a Russian-dominated Ukraine? Probably, but it would be similar to claiming that Nato’s door is open to North Korea or Iran (which it theoretically is). All of the consequences that are likely from this conflict – growing conventional force buildup on the Nato-Russia border, higher levels of defense spending in the United States at the expense of domestic programs, an end to efforts to draw down US military posture in the Middle East, and fewer resources for strategic competition with China – would still be a better outcome than the alternative, in which nuclear weapons have been used. Wars can start quickly or slowly, but it is a dictum of strategy that once started, they take on a logic of their own. It is not too soon to think about how to bring this war to a close. The chances that Putin emerges strategically weak are real. But that does not mean the US can win. It will have to settle for a picture that is much uglier than it was before the war, and the sooner Washington accepts that, the better.

3/8/2022,"The most remarkable thing about Matt Reeves’ The Batman is that, despite the dark knight’s enduring status as a superhero who feels ubiquitous to the point of redundancy on the big screen, this still feels like the caped crusader movie we’ve been anticipating for decades. Without making any obvious attempt to reinvent the character, Robert Pattinson offers us everything we ever wanted from a Batman flick. Reeves gives us a silky, well-oiled machine of a movie, a glorious Gotham City yarn that delves deep into every dirty corner of the masked hero’s world at a stage of his heroic journey when he barely knows what he stands for or who he is standing against. It’s the closest thing we’ll ever have to a big screen sequel to Frank Miller’s Batman: Year One, without needing to borrow so much as a sniff of a storyline from the seminal comic. A tortured, thinking man’s Batman who lives in a Gotham more violent than ever Reeves has gone on record to suggest that he imagined this new Batman as Kurt Cobain, if the singer had been a billionaire whose tortured soul has Wayne Manor as an echo chamber, rather than the 90s grunge scene. And yet ultimately there’s little to link the dead rock star with Bruce Wayne other than a shared penchant for shedloads of mascara and Michael Giacchino’s doom-laden score (which seems to have been inspired by Nirvana’s Something in the Way). The Cobain connection acts more as a mood palette than anything else, with the idea of Batman as a suffering hero hardly that different from the iteration essayed by Christian Bale in Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy. Still, it’s a huge change from the oversized frat-boy gone loco portrayed by Ben Affleck in more recent films, and a welcome return to the superhero’s gothic roots. If anything, the PG-13-rated (15 in the UK) The Batman is even more violent than Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice, but crucially it is the caped crusader’s brutal and freaky new nemesis, Paul Dano’s Riddler, who takes on most of the grim heavy lifting when it comes to brutality. Did Warner Bros make the right decision by pitching the new film firmly in grownup territory? The Fincher-esque pacing Pattinson’s Batman is gun-less, morally uncompromised and uses intellect to try to solve problems before resorting to violence. The fact that the Riddler has been reimagined as a Zodiac-style serial killer who goes after Gotham’s corrupt elite helps here hugely: the dark knight and his sidekick Lieutenant James Gordon – a nailed-on Jeffrey Wright spend more of their time unravelling the villain’s devious posers than beating up lowlife street scum (though there is a fair bit of this for Battinson to dig into too). With its insistent, desperate back and forth of cat and mouse, the near-three-hour film’s slow and steady pacing might almost have been borrowed from David Fincher’s Zodiac, which is notorious for its deliciously glacial path to the final credits. Where the two movies differ is that Fincher was never able to give us the big reveal, as his real-life subject ultimately remained at large, or at least, incognito. By contrast, Dano’s eventual appearance is masterfully held back by Reeves for The Batman’s perfectly pitched final descent into the heart of darkness. Where would you place the new Riddler in the pantheon of big screen supervillains? The voice, the gadgets, the cruel-eyed hunger We’ll never know what Pattinson’s initial Batman voice (the one he has gone on record as admitting to abandoning) sounded like, but there’s a fair bet the Englishman was influenced by Christian Bale’s slightly silly husky growl in the Nolan movies. However he sounded, we do know that Pattinson’s final tones in The Batman are remarkably restrained, as if they are far from the most important aspect of the dark knight’s tonal arsenal. It’s a less showy performance, in many ways, than Bale’s, but one that’s just as dedicated as his predecessor’s. Gaunt and arched, it’s easy to see why Pattinson was once cast as a vampire – he has that look of cruel-eyed hunger about him even when he’s playing the hero. Ben Affleck’s best line as Batman was that his superpower was being rich. It doesn’t take long for Battinson to show that he’s also taking advantage of the vast wealth brought to him by Wayne Enterprises: the new Batmobile is a shiny, black rocket on wheels, as if Darth Vader has somehow been transformed into a motor vehicle. And yet this version of Gotham City’s finest son also relies on more subtle gadgetry – the souped-up contact lenses that record everything they witness are a particularly splendid development for a superhero who wonderfully makes good on his reputation as the world’s greatest detective. Catwoman, The Joker and a reimagined rogue’s gallery Zoë Kravitz’s Selina Kyle is superbly vulnerable and spectacularly badass all at the same time, an expanded backstory as the forgotten child of Gotham gangster Carmine Falcone giving her greater depth than any previous big screen iteration. Colin Farrell’s Penguin may not be a large enough role for the Irishman to be considered for the best supporting actor Oscar, but Mike Marino is surely a shoo-in for best makeup given how completely unrecognisable Farrell is as the new Oswald Cobblepot. One of the biggest questions surrounding The Batman is whether Reeves’ film might connect in any way to the critically acclaimed The Joker. Early on, Pattinson fights thugs who closely resemble devotees of Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck in Todd Phillips’ film, and then there’s that scene near the movie’s denouement in which the Riddler meets a shadowy, cackling figure in Arkham Asylum. It seems likely that the new clown prince of Gotham, in The Batman’s inevitable sequel, will be a figure inspired by Fleck, rather than the man himself. But Warner Bros has certainly given itself at least a couple more years of wriggle room to persuade Phoenix to make a return, should the studio decide that’s the best path forward. If issues with the earlier film’s timeline can be overcome, would you bring him back? Magical elements and the future of DC in Gotham City Pattinson’s version of Batman does not seem quite so grounded in reality as the Bale iteration, but the two caped crusaders probably have more in common than any of their predecessors or successors. As far as we can tell, real superpowers do not exist in either version of Gotham City, which means more far-out supervillains such as Clayface, Poison Ivy and Killer Croc are unlikely to appear any time soon. With Joker having so successfully expanded the Batman mythos without any need to dip into the realms of magic and mysticism, perhaps there’s room for a less fantastical corner of the DC multiverse. It’s certainly hard to imagine this version of the dark knight battling Superman, though Reeves hasn’t ruled out the possibility, so the man of steel could turn up at some point. Are you keen to see Battinson joined by other, more fantastical, superheroes in future episodes? Or did The Batman help convince you that the DC movies are much, much better when they just keep it simple?",Arts/Film,"The Batman: Robert Pattinson’s voice, the Riddler’s brutality, Gotham’s makeover – discuss with spoilers",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/08/the-batman-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves
3/8/2022,"Until a few years ago, only publishing industry insiders would have understood the role of the sensitivity reader. Then came American Dirt. The Jeanine Cummins novel sold to a US publisher for a seven-figure advance, was chosen for Oprah’s Book Club, and was touted as “the new Grapes of Wrath”. On release in 2020, early readers noted that the white author’s depiction of Mexican people was, at best, flawed, inaccurate, and riddled with stereotypes and, at worst, simply racist. A sensitivity reader is an additional editor who works alongside the publishing house staffer who acquired the rights to your book. This individual will conduct a very specific read of the manuscript, and offer notes on characters from marginalised groups, or elements which may cause offence. The argument goes that if American Dirt had been sufficiently scrutinised by a reader of Mexican heritage, some of the furore could have been avoided. The publishing industry is split over the increased usage of sensitivity readers. Lionel Shriver said she would rather quit writing than have her work scrutinised. John Boyne tweeted: “No serious writer would ever allow their work to be so sanitised.” Kate Clanchy claimed sensitivity readers “sullied my memoir to suit their agenda”, and parted ways with the publisher who employed such professionals. My background as an author is in young adult fiction, an area in which sensitivity readers are common, especially in the US, so I’m less fazed. I have also been a sensitivity reader, informally. An author friend asked if I’d read his manuscript to check if I felt he’d accurately depicted a transgender character. He mostly had; there were some quirks he’d got wrong, things that only someone who had gone through the grind of gender transition – like me – would be aware of. I see my job as a giddy, creative game of make-believe in which I spend my office hours imagining what it’s like to be someone who isn’t me. I am a trans, 40-year-old woman from Bradford navigating life on the south coast of England, but I don’t want to exclusively write characters in my own demographic. Through my fiction, I’ve been a Time Lord; a Scot; a fashion model; an oligarch’s daughter and Bloody Mary. It’s all part of the job. However, when I’m writing a character who has experienced oppression, I need to take extra care. When writing my forthcoming adult debut, Her Majesty’s Royal Coven, I created a character called Leonie, a mixed-race woman from Leeds. The book is about magic and witchcraft, but it is also a story about women and feminism – and I felt it was odd to pretend race wasn’t an issue in the fictional coven. There were elements of Leonie that were very familiar to me. Like her, I’m from Yorkshire, I’m queer, and I’m an ambitious gobshite. Unlike Leonie, I am white. So, to the surprise of my UK publisher, I petitioned to get a sensitivity reader. If I was to include Leonie in my book, I wanted to know I had done her, and myself, justice. My publishers agreed so I sent my manuscript to a sensitivity reader, herself a mixed-race woman, and I waited to hear her thoughts. My editor checked in with me to ensure I was ready to hear some things I might not want to hear. Of course, no one wants to think of themselves as bigoted, but if I’d inadvertently written something inaccurate or insulting, I’d much rather know while the book was a Word document and not on the shelves of bookstores. To me it was a no-brainer. The reader’s notes came back and, I stress, I was under no obligation to make changes to the novel, but I did. It was the same sort of feedback I’d given my friend – I’d got a few tiny details wrong and, in one sequence, had actually been a bit snobby about a council estate, which is ironic because I was born on one. Unconscious bias strikes! There is a bigger issue under the surface of all this. We wouldn’t need external editors if the in-house teams at UK publishers were more diverse. I have loved working with every single one of them, but the six UK editors I’ve had since 2011 have all been cisgender white women from (I’m guessing) quite comfortable backgrounds. Their big bosses, almost exclusively, have been cisgender white men. I am starting to see a change, and that’s a good thing, but for now, I think sensitivity readers are here to stay, and I’d urge authors to welcome them into their process. After all, don’t we all want to release our book into the world safe in the knowledge it’s as rigorously edited as it can be? The final word goes to Society of Authors chair, and author, Joanne Harris: “It takes courage for an author to admit they may not have all the answers. (Note: Dickens changed his depiction of Jews after corresponding with one of his Jewish critics, who pointed out antisemitism in Oliver Twist.) In later years, he also went through the text and revised it quite heavily, removing more than 200 of the more extreme antisemitic references, to the disappointment of some of his more antisemitic readers. He showed the capacity to grow. Perhaps that’s what makes a great writer.”  Juno Dawson is an author and screenwriter",Opinion/Opinion,Stop moaning about sensitivity readers – if there was diversity in publishing we wouldn’t need them | Juno Dawson,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/08/stop-moaning-sensitivity-readers-diversity-publishing
3/8/2022,"The Marvel takeover of childhood often seems all-encompassing. Really, though, Stan Lee’s stable has long embellished Norse and African myths. Some great new books riff on those riffs – parents might just sell these to a reluctant bookworm on their parallels to Marvel. Writer-illustrator Louie Stowell’s terrific Loki: A Bad God’s Guide to Being Good (Walker Books, £7.99) imagines the Norse god portrayed in the Marvel films by Tom Hiddleston as a mischievous, petulant 11-year-old, banished to naughty-step Earth to atone for his misdemeanours. Often laugh-out-loud funny, this is an irreverent romp through practical moral philosophy, like Netflix’s The Good Place with more snarky cartoon snakes. A talking diary backchats Loki throughout. Next: Wakanda, the setting for the Marvel film Black Panther. Based initially in the US suburbs, Jamar J Perry’s Cameron Battle and the Hidden Kingdoms (Bloomsbury, £6.99) is an assured debut starring three friends who discover an ancient and powerful book. Filled with lore, it is also a portal to Chidani, a supernatural Igbo realm where, unbeknown to young Cameron, the Battle family has been tasked with ensuring stability between the worlds and maintaining Igbo heritage, ruptured by slavery. The fight has already taken the lives of his parents. With his friends Zion and Aliyah, Cameron learns magical warrior moves and becomes enmeshed in a godly power struggle. Gripping and fast-paced, this is also a novel that foregrounds acceptance and queerness via the emotional tenderness between tweenage boys. Multiverses? Ross Welford, always excellent, has one of those. Into the Sideways World (HarperCollins, £6.99) introduces 12-year-old Willa, whose parents operate a run-down campsite, and new friend Manny, an impulsive foster kid recently arrived at school. War is imminent. While stalking an unfamiliar creature into a sea cave during a full moon, they wake up in another version of their own lives, but somewhere else – Willa is Mina, her sister is a brother, her parents don’t fight. War is over, the climate catastrophe averted. Can they get back? Do they want to get back? There are new iterations, too, of other solid formulas. Sabine Adeyinka provides an enthralling twist on the boarding school novel: Jummy at the River School (Chicken House, £6.99) is set in Nigeria in the 90s. Scatty Jumoke yearns to attend a prestigious boarding school; she gets the grades, but has to leave her clever but economically disadvantaged friend Caro behind. Adeyinka’s debut is full of old-fashioned fun: midnight feasts and sporting escapades, plus crocodiles, minus mobile phones. But justice is at the heart of this book. When Caro does turn up, it is to work as a maid to the haughty matron. It takes pluck and creativity for Jummy to resolve things, and this book will have kids salivating for Nigerian snacks such as puff-puff and chinchin. Hannah Gold, the author of the bestselling children’s hardback debut of 2021, The Last Bear, is back with another lyrical page-turner about solidarity between humans and animals. Exit bear, enter The Lost Whale (HarperCollins, £12.99), illustrated once again by the great Levi Pinfold. In sort-of repeating herself, Gold actually remains original – young Londoner Rio is banished to stay with a grandmother he barely knows in California when his mother is taken in for a mental health intervention. Scared, angry, Rio feels guilty at having (he thinks) failed his mother. Gold is fantastic on the anguish of young carers – and the magnificence of large cetaceans, whose presence Rio can sense before anyone else can, making him very useful on whale-spotting tours. But the whale he knows best, White Beak, seems to be calling for help: what can he do? Finally, a story that has only just begun to be told. American author Kelly Yang is better known for YA, but New from Here (Simon & Schuster, £7.99) is a sensational middle grade book about a family disrupted, then healed, by the pandemic. Knox Wei-Evans and his family are Asian Americans living in Hong Kong when a new virus is discovered in Wuhan. It’ll pass, says his dad, who’s got some masks, somewhere, from Sars. Soon, though, the three siblings and their mum are dispatched back to the US to ride it out, bumpily – just what happened to Yang and her brood. The virus follows. This is a warm, sensitive, deep-dive of a family story, full of kid logic (inadvisable garage sales, secret LinkedIn profiles), bitter sibling rivalry, Knox’s ADHD-born intensity and the imperative to stand up to racism.

3/8/2022,"Fifa is opening a special transfer window for foreign players stranded in Russia because of the invasion of Ukraine. But the players’ union Fifpro said allowing players to suspend contracts did not go far enough and that they should be able to terminate deals. “In order to facilitate the departure of foreign players and coaches from Russia, in the event that clubs affiliated to the Football Union of Russia (FUR) do not reach a mutual agreement with their respective foreign players and coaches before or on 10 March 2022 ... the foreign players and coaches will have the right to unilaterally suspend their employment contracts with the FUR-affiliated clubs in question until the end of the season in Russia (30 June 2022),” Fifa said. “The suspension of a contract … will mean that players and coaches will be considered ‘out of contract’ until 30 June 2022 and will therefore be at liberty to sign a contract with another club without facing consequences of any kind.” Fifa’s move is only a temporary measure that will not provide much help, Fifpro said. Last week the Polish FA urged Fifa to grant an emergency reopening of the transfer window. “The decision ... to allow foreign players to only suspend their contracts and thus only temporarily leave Russian clubs is too timid,” Fifpro said. “It will be hard for players to find employment for the remainder of the season with uncertainty looming over them and, within a few weeks, they will be in a very difficult situation once again. “It is unsatisfactory even for players who are tied to short-term contracts in Russia where contracts typically end in December – and who may not want or be able to return after 30 June 2022 … Fifpro communicated to Fifa last week that these players should be allowed to terminate their contracts.” Fifpro asked that Fifa, and its European counterpart Uefa, set up a fund to help players and coaches in Ukraine. “It is disappointing that other stakeholders in this process were not prepared to agree to this important step,” it said. With regard to foreign players under contract at Ukrainian clubs, Fifa said: “Unless the parties to the relevant contract explicitly agree otherwise, all employment contracts of foreign players and coaches with clubs affiliated to the Ukrainian Association of Football (UAF) will be deemed automatically suspended until the end of the season in Ukraine (30 June 2022).” The Ukrainian league has been suspended indefinitely.",Sport/Football,‘Too timid’: Fifa deal for foreign players to leave Russian clubs is criticised ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/08/fifa-deal-foreign-players-leave-russian-clubs-criticised-fifpro-too-timid
