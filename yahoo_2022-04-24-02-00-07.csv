4/24/2022,"Jan. 6 committee says GOP lawmakers worked with the Trump White House to stop Biden from becoming president. Reps. Matt Gaetz, Jim Jordan, and Marjorie Taylor Greene were among the GOP representatives named by a former White House aide. They participated in calls and meetings in which they discussed legal avenues to claim Trump won the election, the aide said. Republican lawmakers held calls with former President Donald Trump in December 2020 to plot ways to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, according to court records filed by the congressional committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. The committee filed deposition excerpts on Friday, which detail how Republican lawmakers, such as Reps. Matt Gaetz and Jim Jordan, plotted with Trump to stop then-candidate Joe Biden from becoming president. Gaetz, Jordan, and other Republican lawmakers participated in calls and meetings with Trump and his aides after he lost the 2020 presidential election, according to testimony given to the committee by Cassidy Hutchinson, who served as an aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Hutchinson said in the deposition records that various Republican lawmakers, including Gaetz, Jordan, Reps. Scott Perry, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Louis Gohmert, either met in person or dialed into meetings discussing ways to usurp Biden's victory. ""They felt that [former Vice President Mike Pence] had the authority to — pardon me if my phrasing isn't correct on this, but — send votes back to the States or the electors back to the States,"" Hutchinson said. Other Republican lawmakers who are part of the House Freedom Caucus were also part of these meetings, Hutchinson said. Representatives for Gaetz, Jordan, Perry, Taylor Greene, and Gohmert did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. During these meetings, the Republican lawmakers explored avenues that ""could potentially be a constitutional and viable option to either stall certification of the election or to delay the inauguration or to assert that Mr. Trump had actually won,"" she said. After the results of the 2020 presidential election came out, the Trump campaign has filed dozens of lawsuits alleging voter fraud, most of which have so far been denied, dismissed, or withdrawn. Independent election watchdog groups have said repeatedly that there was no widespread voter fraud. After the results came out, for example, The New York Times contacted election officials in every state, each of which said there is no evidence that fraud influenced the presidential election. But even after leaving office, Trump has continued to insist that the election was rigged. Republican lawmakers have echoed his unsubstantiated claims.

4/24/2022,"TOKYO (AP) — A tour boat with 26 people aboard was missing in the frigid waters of northern Japan on Saturday, hours after sending a distress call that it was sinking, the coast guard said. No survivors have been found after more than 10 hours of intense search involving six patrol boats, five aircraft and divers. The coast guard said it will continue the search through the night. The 19-ton Kazu 1 made an emergency call in early afternoon, saying the ship’s bow had flooded and it was beginning to sink and tilt while traveling off the western coast of Shiretoko Peninsula in the northern island of Hokkaido, the coast guard said. The tour boat has since lost contact, according to the coast guard. It said the boat was carrying 24 passengers, including two children, and two crew. Average April sea temperatures in Shiretoko National Park are just above freezing. An official of the vessel's operator, Shiretoko Pleasure Cruise, said he could not comment as he had to respond to calls from worried families of the passengers. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, who was attending a two-day water summit in Kumamoto in southern Japan, was canceling his program for Sunday and was set to return to Tokyo to deal with the missing boat, the NHK public broadcaster reported. High waves and strong winds were observed in the area around noon, according to a local fisheries cooperative. Japanese media reports said fishing boats had returned to port before noon because of the bad weather. NHK said there was a warning for high waves of up to 3 meters (9 feet) high. Yoshihiko Yamada, a Tokai University marine science professor, said the boat was likely to have run aground after it was tossed around in high waves and damaged, flooded and probably sank. A tour boat of that size usually does not carry a life boat, and passengers possibly could not jump out of a rapidly sinking vessel with its windows probably closed to shield them from strong winds. In an interview with the TBS television, Yamada said there is also a slight possibility that the boat might have been hit by a whale. The cold temperature and strong wind could cause hypothermia and put the passengers in severe conditions for survival, according to Jun Abe, vice chairman of the Society of Water Rescue and Survival Research. “It's a very severe condition especially when they are wet,"" Abe told TBS. According to the operator's website, the tour takes about three hours and offers a scenic view of the western coast of the peninsula, including the nature and animals such as whales, dolphins and the brown bear. The national park is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and is famous as the southernmost region to see drifting sea ice.",World/Associated Press,Tour boat with 26 aboard missing in frigid Japan waters,https://news.yahoo.com/tour-boat-26-missing-japan-112816611.html
4/24/2022,"Finance website WalletHub revealed the best and worst US airlines based on data from the Department of Transportation. Delta Air Lines took the top spot, scoring high in terms of reliability, comfort, and customer satisfaction. Southwest ranked dead last, followed by American Airlines, JetBlue Airways, and Frontier Airlines. Personal finance website WalletHub revealed the best airlines in the US based on 2021 flight data collected from the US Department of Transportation. The company ranked 11 carriers from best to worst, including mainline airlines like American and Southwest, and low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier. Two regional carriers — SkyWest Airlines and Envoy Air — were included because they make up at least 1% of domestic scheduled service and report data to the DOT, according to the company. WalletHub scored each airline based on 16 metrics across four main categories, including baggage, departures, and complaints, animal-related incidents, inflight comfort, and safety. Subcategories included factors like delays, WiFi availability, legroom, denied boardings, and price. While price is a common dealbreaker for many consumers, WalletHub noted that its report examines ""overlooked aspects of air travel"" to help travelers ""make more informed decisions."" However, the company said ""for the sake of fairness,"" it considered costs ""in relation to inflight amenities."" ""For example, it wouldn't be right to penalize an airline that charges for drinks if its tickets are far cheaper than those from an airline with free in-flight refreshments,"" it explained. WalletHub took each airline's score from the four major categories to determine the overall best and worst carriers in the US. Scores were based on specific criteria, like the rate of delays or the number of customer complaints. Then, the company totaled the points from each category to give an overall performance rank. Delta earned the highest score of 70.48 out of 100, while Southwest came in last with just 30.60 points earned. WalletHub disclosed that each metric was allowed a maximum number of available points an airline could earn and that the weight of each and its calculation into the overall score was based on the company's subjective view. However, it said points were generally allocated ""based on common sense."" In addition to ranking the best airline, the company also gave six other awards, including cheapest airline, safest airline, most reliable airline, the best airline for pets, least complained-about airline, and most comfortable airline. Delta took home the most medals, including being the best overall US airline, the most reliable, and tied for the safest for animals. Meanwhile, JetBlue and Frontier earned top spots for comfort and affordability, respectively. Here's a closer look at WalletHub's best and worst US airlines, and the individual awards each received. Southwest ranked last on WalletHub's list, bringing up the rear in several categories, including being the least reliable and the least safe airline. WalletHub gave Southwest a score of 7.84 out of 50 for reliability, whereas the top performers, including Delta and Hawaiian, scored above 30. The data also showed Southwest's reliability tanked in comparison to the year prior, which earned a score of 26.80. This is likely, in part, due to the airline's multi-day meltdown in October 2021 that left thousands of passengers stranded. The airline got its low safety rating due to an uncontained engine failure in 2018 that resulted in the death of a passenger, which forced WalletHub to deduct points. American ranked second-to-last on WalletHub's list, earning low scores in reliability, price, and safety. According to the data, the carrier sustained at least 50 passenger or employee injuries that required medical care in 2021, causing its low safety rating. Meanwhile, the carrier earned a reliability score of 14.24, though it did earn a higher comfort score of 4 out of 5. JetBlue was named the worst US airline by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year due to poor on-time performance and a high number of passenger complaints. WalletHub's data reared similar results, scoring its reliability at 16.52 out of 50, as well ranking fourth in terms of customer complaints. However, not all is bad for JetBlue. The carrier was ranked the best airline for onboard comfort, including offering free amenities like WiFi, inflight entertainment, snacks, and beverages. The carrier also offers the most legroom in economy, Conde Nest Traveler reported. Frontier ranked low in terms of reliability, with a score of 13.18, and came in last for comfort due to a lack of inflight amenities, like WiFi or free snacks and drinks. The carrier also configures its planes with 28 inches of legroom, which is the lowest offered in the US, according to travel magazine AFAR. However, Frontier did earn the top ranking for affordability, offering consumers the cheapest plane tickets of any other carrier. The data showed Frontier's airfare averaged 3.53 cents per mile. While United ranked low compared to other carriers, it received the third-best reliability score of 26.67 out of 50 and a high comfort score of 4.5 out of 5. However, its low overall ranking can be contributed to its high number of passenger complaints. According to DOT data, United had 3,581 complaints in 2021, which came out to 29.73 complaints per 100,000 passengers, WalletHub revealed. Regional carrier SkyWest, which flies on behalf of United, Delta, American, and Alaska, earned high rankings for pet-friendliness and customer satisfaction. Specifically, the carrier received 328 complaints in total, according to DOT data, giving it a rate of 0.92 complaints per 100,000 passengers. Because Skywest flies for four carriers, WalletHub used the average maximum and minimum scores for each situation to determine the regional carrier's overall comfort score. Rounding out the top five carriers, Spirit Airlines performed well in 2021 in terms of affordability and safety. The carrier is the second-cheapest airline behind Frontier, with an average airfare of 3.82 cents per mile. Meanwhile, the airline received a score of 19.99 out of 50 for reliability, which is average compared to other airlines. Like Frontier, Spirit did rank low in onboard comfort, offering no free amenities inflight, except for a seat and a personal item. Envoy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of American and is one of the top-performing operators, according to WalletHub. The airline earned an overall score of 60.46 out of 100, which is double Southwest's score of 30.60. It also scored high for pet safety. However, Envoy was the most expensive carrier of 2021, with an average fare of 12.42 cents per mile. This can mostly be attributed to the carrier flying on behalf of American to small markets that have higher operating costs, causing airfare to increase. Alaska is the third-best airline in the US, according to WalletHub. The airline earned the title of the safest airline and scored high in terms of reliability, comfort, and price. The airline scored 4.5 out of 5 for comfort, tying with Delta and just losing out to JetBlue. Hawaiian is the runner-up this year, scoring high in affordability, reliability, and safety. However, the airline only beat out Spirit and Frontier in terms of comfort, scoring 2 out of 5. Meanwhile, the airline had the second-highest number of passenger complaints with 37.63 per 100,000 passengers, according to WalletHub data. The airline received an overall high score due to its strong on-time performance and safety. Just like the Wall Street Journal, WalletHub named Delta the best airline in the US. The Atlanta-based carrier is the most reliable airline and came in second for comfort, tieing with Alaska, Southwest, and United. The airline has also proved its responsibility with pets, reporting no animal-related incidents in 2021. Moreover, the airline had one of the lowest rates of consumer complaints, receiving 1.92 complaints per 100,000 passengers, according to WalletHub data.

4/24/2022,"The ongoing war in Syria was supposed to be a crucible for the modern Russian war machine, reforming its operational capabilities in preparation for future conflicts. Now that Russia is facing a test of those skills in Ukraine, it is turning into a disaster that they should have seen coming. Moscow officially lost only 112 servicemen in six and a half years in Syria, compared to what it admits are 1,351 in a single month in Ukraine—the true numbers are likely to be far higher. And they have been forced to humiliatingly pull out around 40,000 troops from around Kyiv and Chernihiv having failed to make any significant progress in those regions and falling back to their old targets in eastern Ukraine. This raises the question of exactly what the Kremlin learned in Syria and, more importantly, what it should have learned but obviously has not. Unlike Ukraine, Syria’s cities would never be part of the Russian federation and could therefore be flattened. Meanwhile, its non-white population was framed as foreign terrorists. Jabhat al-Nusra fighters, ISIS, and hundreds of children were portrayed to the voters back home as equally fair targets. By contrast, Ukrainians are largely seen by the Russian public as Russians themselves or, at the very least, close cousins. These factors freed Russia up to use Syria as merely a means to an end, or more specifically, two ends. First, it used Syria as a proving ground to enhance command-and-control coordination. Like its Soviet predecessor, Russia's military is an artillery force with armored battalions and the ground-based nature of its power is not as fast nor flexible as air or naval forces, making such coordination critical. Not to mention, if such command coordination is achieved, then as the Institute for the Study of War’s lead Russia analyst, Mason Clark, wrote in a 2021 report, it “will erode one of the United States and NATO’s key technological advantages.” Second, Moscow declared a withdrawal from Syria in March 2016, then again in January 2017, and again in December of that year. This wasn’t just a feint to get its enemies to lower their guard, it also helped prevent Russia from being pulled too deeply into the war, thus minimizing losses. But just as importantly, it broke the war into a series of campaigns, allowing Moscow to rotate its forces through Syria, giving them ample combat experience. As Michael Kofman, director of the Russia studies program at the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), wrote in a 2020 report, “The entire Russian military must now serve [in Syria] in order to progress in rank.” According William Alberque, the director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), some of the lessons that were not learned well enough include use of drones for artillery spotting, the danger of MANPADS on the contested battlefield, and the need for secure supply lines. Each of these factors have proven devastating for Russian forces in Ukraine. But the biggest lessons, he said, have been how to detect, disrupt, and destroy small groups of fighters, the importance of the destruction not just of suppression of enemy air defenses, the use of secure comms, the value of precision-guided missiles , and the benefit of drawing the enemy out rather than engaging in urban warfare. Albuquerque added that Russia learned a few more things in Syria. Namely, “how to destroy cities, terror tactics to make civilians flee, and the use of proxies as holding forces/cannon fodder.” So what went wrong? For one thing, Russia is one of the most corrupt nations in the world, and by far the most corrupt major power. Ruling a mafia state has its advantages if you’re the Godfather, but it’s hard to know who to trust. Moscow recently purged 150 Federal Security Service (FSB) agents and sent Sergei Beseda, the head of the FSB’s 5th Service, which handles intelligence in Ukraine, to Lefortovo Prison, which was used under Stalin to conduct torture-based interrogations and mass executions. One theory says Beseda gave information to the CIA, but the official reason, which may very well be true, is that he lied to the state and stole funds meant for espionage activities in Ukraine. If true, this means Putin’s own spy chiefs not only let him bring a knife to a gun fight—they sold off the combat blade and bought a cheap butter spreader. Another thing that led Putin astray was his own over-confidence. Since taking office in 2000, he has been involved in six wars—Chechnya, Georgia, the North Caucasus, Syria, the Central African Republic (CAR), and Ukraine.All but the last have been victorious. Syria and the CAR are ongoing, but the preservation of Bashar al-Assad’s regime and Faustin-Archange Touadera’s administration represent strategic wins. Putin thought he couldn’t lose. Corruption and over-confidence prepared a path, but the biggest problem was Putin’s lack of experience ina war of this scale. Syria was a limited deployment in a far-off desert nation with minimal ground forces, Georgia only lasted 12 days, and Russia supported Touadera in the CAR from a distance with weapons, military instructors and Wagner mercenaries. Besides, even if Ukraine was the same game as Syria, and Russia could simply copy/paste its lessons, it still wouldn’t help since Moscow has apparently forgotten those lessons. Russia did apply its Syria lessons in Ukraine—but it did so in 2014, when it used Crimea to train a rapid-reaction professional force. Now, however, Moscow is running four combined arms headquarters independently with only partial management at the defense center in Moscow. Why? Partly because it’s not just propaganda when Putin talks about a “special military operation.” He truly believed the rest of Ukraine, like Crimea, would offer little resistance and that the war would only last a matter of days. In Syria, says military historian Peter Caddick-Adams, “They were not up against a peer adversary—in fact they have never been: Afghan, Chechnya, Georgia, Syria—unlike in Ukraine. Syria was predominantly an air war, with little threat, so Russian pilots treated it more as range practice, dumping munitions on preselected targets” he told The Daily Beast. “Thus, what Russia did not learn from Syria was how to coordinate an all arms battle (artillery, armor, anti-tank, air defense, infantry, engineers, etc) at high tempo in complex terrain with aircraft of different types, helicopters, airborne and marine troops, with a well-balanced logistics and supply system—which is what they have needed for Ukraine.” He added, “Russian communications are very lowbrow, and they are using unencrypted mobile phones in Ukraine, a bad habit picked up in Syria, where few opponents could understand Russian or had the technical competence to intercept.” Simply put, Russia’s PhD in desert warfare is making for a poor career in Ukraine. Indeed, few things have revolutionized the modern Russian military like the war in Syria, but nothing will affect it quite like Ukraine. One might even call this Russia's Vietnam moment. But one thing’s for certain, Russia looked at Ukraine and mistook a tiger for a cat. Now even if it decides to cut its losses and completely withdraw, it may not be so easy. As the old Chinese saying goes, when you’re riding a tiger, the hard part is getting off. Read more at The Daily Beast.
