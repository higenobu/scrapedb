4/23/2022,"Ronnie O’Sullivan continued to home in on a record-equalling seventh Crucible title on a day when a pigeon fluttered on to centre stage at the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield. The avian interloper flew down from the rafters and briefly alighted on the bottom cushion as Yan Bingtao prepared to break off in the sixth frame of his afternoon match against defending champion Mark Selby. It was ushered out via the players’ entrance, past a startled Selby who was returning to the arena, and tournament officials later confirmed it had been captured and released unharmed. Later, O’Sullivan showed just how much he fancies emulating Stephen Hendry’s record as he soared into a 12-4 lead over Mark Allen, meaning he needs just one more frame from their concluding session on Saturday to reach the last eight for the 20th time. O’Sullivan started the match by threatening a maximum break after potting 10 reds and nine blacks, and posted a further break of 131 as he cruised into a 6-2 lead at the end of the morning session. Allen won the first frame upon the evening resumption but missed the simplest of pinks with the frame at his mercy in the next, and the mistake proved pivotal as O’Sullivan cleared for 7-3 and would never look back. O’Sullivan got 88 points into another possible 147 in the next before running out of position, then capitalised on a pair of costly errors by his opponent to raise the real prospect of wrapping up his last-eight place with a session to space. Allen prevented that embarrassment with a gutsy break of 110 but O’Sullivan took the final two frames of the evening - the last his second century of the match - to make his progression on Saturday a formality. Earlier, Mark Williams did move into the last eight with a session to spare, wrapping up a dominant 13-3 win over 20-year-old Jackson Page, who trains at the three-time champion’s club in Tredegar. Williams produced some of the best form of his career to compile six centuries and eight further breaks of 50-plus as he rendered Friday night’s scheduled concluding session obsolete. And he revealed he had piled on the agony for his young opponent, whom he had also fleeced in a card game on the eve of what turned out to be the concluding session of their match. “We had dinner on Thursday night and a game of cards in the hotel reception – I took 15 off him,” revealed Williams. “We will do the same thing again after this match - just chill out. “If it was anybody else, I’d love to have won with a session to spare. I don’t feel like that playing Jackson. It’s a good learning curve for him and we will see how he bounces back.” Shell-shocked Page called Williams’ form “ridiculous” but the 47-year-old sought to play down his chances of a fourth crown, insisting: “I ain’t a championship contender. I can’t play much better than that at my age. I cannot improve.” Opening with a break of 110 to move further in front, Williams then snatched the 10th frame with a clearance to black after Page missed the last red to leave him stranded on a highest break of 69. Two half-centuries in the next frame made it 10-1 for Williams, who was fulfilling his tongue-in-cheek claim that he wanted to “destroy” Page, who set up the meeting with an impressive first-round success over Barry Hawkins. Page got a second frame on the board but Williams was merciless, firing back-to-back centuries and then, after Page clawed back another frame, finishing with a 56 to book a last-eight meeting with either Selby or Bingtao. Selby twice fought back from two frames behind to end the opening session against former Masters champion Bingtao all square at 4-4, ahead of the final two sessions of their match on Saturday. Stephen Maguire is two frames away from the quarter-finals after surging to an 11-5 lead over reigning UK champion Zhao Xintong ahead of their concluding session on Saturday. Jack Lisowski has criticised the World Snooker Tour for refusing to let him wear a Ukraine flag on his waistcoat at this year’s tournament in Sheffield. The No 14 seed, who represents England and was born in Cheltenham, has a Ukrainian grandfather. “Everyone in this room would agree [to] supporting Ukraine so why the hell can’t I wear it?” Lisowski told the BBC. “It’s something that is close to my heart. My grandad is Ukrainian, my dad has been out there. It is very sad what is going on over there.” Lisowski, who will play Neil Robertson in the second round, added: “I tried to wear it [in Sheffield] and they told me I couldn’t unless I was Ukrainian. I’ve got some Ukrainian in me, but it wasn’t enough … I want to wear it but I wasn’t allowed.” The World Snooker Tour (WST) said in a statement: “Our policy is to not allow our sport to be used as a political platform at the world championship. We are strongly against the invasion of any sovereign nation and all forms of violence or oppression. “Our thoughts and prayers are with the people who are suffering as a result of the current conflict in Ukraine.”",Sport/Sport,O’Sullivan flying but pigeon takes centre stage at World Snooker Championship,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/22/world-snooker-mark-williams-ronnie-o-sullivan-crucible
4/23/2022,"Ed Balls has ruled out a return to politics as a Labour candidate in the upcoming Wakefield byelection. The former shadow chancellor, who lost his Morley and Outwood seat at the 2015 general election, wrote on Twitter that he had “no intention of putting myself forward” for the contest. The West Yorkshire constituency is due to elect a new MP after the incumbent Imran Ahmad Khan was convicted last week of sexually assaulting a teenage boy. Khan, who was thrown out of the Conservative party after the verdict at Southwark crown court last week, announced he would be standing down to contest the jury’s decision. There had been reports that Balls would contest the seat but the former education secretary, who is married to the shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, tweeted: “Back from New York to find Wakefield speculation still running. “I appreciate all the messages but, for removal of any doubt, no one’s spoken to me about it and I’ve no intention of putting myself forward when the current MP finally resigns!” A date for the byelection has yet to be set. Balls has embarked on a career outside politics since losing his seat, including a stint as Norwich City FC chairman and appearing on cookery and travel television programmes. He also appeared on the BBC programme Strictly Come Dancing programme in 2016 and has established himself as a political and social commentator in the media. During his decade in the Commons, Balls served under former prime minister Tony Blair as a Treasury minister and was later promoted to the cabinet as education secretary by Gordon Brown, with whom he was closely allied. He finished third in the 2010 Labour leadership election, which was won by Ed Miliband, following Brown’s resignation from No 10, and held shadow cabinet positions until his election defeat five years later. Wakefield turned blue during Boris Johnson’s landslide election victory in 2019 as he took swathes of “red wall” seats in Labour’s traditional heartlands in the north of England, the Midlands and north Wales. Labour had held the seat since the 1930s until Khan’s victory. Keir Starmer will have his sights set on recapturing it from a Conservative party besieged by allegations of rule-breaking in recent months and after Johnson and Rishi Sunak were fined by police for breaching coronavirus rules during lockdown.",News/Politics,Ed Balls rules out political comeback for Labour in Wakefield byelection,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/ed-balls-rules-out-political-comeback-for-labour-in-wakefield-byelection
4/23/2022,"Mikel Arteta has had plenty of non-negotiables since he took over at Arsenal on a mission to restore the glory days of Arsène Wenger, but there is one, surely, that stands above the rest: the imperative for non-stop running, collective intensity in the press and transitions. “I don’t see the game played in any other way,” the manager said before the showdown with Manchester United at Emirates Stadium on Saturday lunchtime. It is some years since this was the fixture of the season but it will nonetheless bristle with significance. Arsenal will want to build on Wednesday’s 4-2 win at Chelsea to drive their push for a top-four finish; United are hoping for something, anything, to get back on track after the 4-0 humbling at Liverpool. If United take nothing, their aim of Champions League qualification would probably be dead. “It’s that we are dominant, that we are playing as much as possible in the opponent’s half, that we are aggressive, that we want to regain the ball as quick as possible, that when the ball is over us I want to see everybody sprinting back,” Arteta continued. “To do that you have to be really fit. Your lifestyle is key. Your natural qualities and what you can deliver physically become really important. Because now we are doing it once a week but hopefully we will be required to do it three times a week [next season].” The key is that Arsenal are able to do it. Arteta has a plan, a modern one which chimes with what the very best are doing, and the Arsenal support and board can see it. There is a fair chance that the vision has insulated Arteta during the low moments of a tenure that began in December 2019 – most notably the horror run that led up to Christmas of the following year. It does not work all of the time. But it is there. Ralf Rangnick, the United interim manager, who will give way to Erik ten Hag at the end of the season, is desperate to see something similar from his players. It is how he wants to play. But if it was glaring by its absence at Liverpool on Tuesday it has hardly been the only time, leading him to vent his frustration and rival managers to make comments that sound utterly damning. “It’s not a big secret that when United lose the ball their reverse gear is not the best from everybody,” Southampton’s Ralph Hasenhüttl said after his team’s 1-1 draw at Old Trafford in February. United have come to look easy to play against and lack physicality. Their opponents have had time on the ball and often been able to build up the field with comfort. “You shouldn’t allow them to go past our lines as easy as that,” Rangnick complained after last Saturday’s 3-2 home win over Norwich. “It’s what this team does not do well enough. We are the only team in the league that defends this way.” The midfielder Jesse Lingard has called for United to bring the needed energy against Arsenal but it is anybody’s guess as to whether they can respond. Arteta’s words will resonate with Rangnick and possibly make him envious. “We have that, 100%” Arteta said of the buy-in from each player. “Some can perform it better than others. But they are willing to do it. In big games like this, it’s a big part – the physical part, how you go about the duels, the rhythm that you play, the energy that you create, how you transmit that to your fans. “We have to accept what we can do and then we have to find the best players to fit what we want to do. We want players that want to come here. That’s, for me, the number one [priority] ... when I look in their eyes and talk to them – that they are really willing to come here and they understand what we try to do.” The mood has shifted sharply at Arsenal, as it often does after a significant result – good or bad. Before Chelsea they had lost four out of five games and seemed to be imploding. Now there is possibility again. Arteta is unhappy at the quick turnaround from Stamford Bridge; his squad trained at the Emirates post-teatime on Friday in order to maximise recovery and then have as full a session as possible. The chance of another setback can never be discounted. Arsenal faced a Southampton team last Saturday who were reeling from a 6-0 home defeat by Chelsea and promptly lost 1-0. United are a similarly wounded beast. But the touchstones are there for Arteta. How Eddie Nketiah scored twice at Chelsea – could it spark him before his expected departure as a free agent in the summer? How Bukayo Saka seized the ball to convert the stoppage-time fourth from the spot, the first penalty he had taken since missing for England in the Euro 2020 final shootout defeat by Italy. How a third academy product, Emile Smith Rowe, got the other goal. Arsenal will be greeted by a mosaic display in the stands before kick-off as the fans also seek to play their part. “I am really pleased to hear about that because it means they are engaged with the team,” Arteta said. “I’ve always said that if we make this stadium a fortress it will be really difficult not to be successful.”",Sport/Football,Arteta demands hard-running Arsenal stick to high-energy plan against United,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/arteta-demands-hard-running-arsenal-stick-to-high-energy-plan-against-united
4/23/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has said Gary Neville was right to apologise for wanting Hannibal Mejbri to kick Liverpool players during Manchester United’s chastening defeat at Anfield, insisting: “You cannot sort your own problems by hurting opposition players.” Neville admitted he “erred on the slightly unprofessional side of commentary” when saying he was proud of the 19-year-old, an 84th-minute substitute in Tuesday’s 4-0 defeat, for fouling Jordan Henderson and Naby Keïta in quick succession, earning a booking for the former and a warning for the latter. The Liverpool manager believes that crossed a line. “He had to apologise for that, rightly so,” said Klopp. “I understand where he is coming from. Obviously you want to see some aggression, but there is a difference between aggression and kicking players. Aggression in football means you are ready to hurt yourself, not the other one. I don’t blame the kid, he came on and the game was a bit quick, and he was a bit late here and there. It’s all good. “Aggression in football is absolutely fine but you cannot sort your own problems by hurting the opposition players, that is what I have never understood. Of course things can happen in football, it is a high-speed game, but not these kind of things where you don’t care about another colleague who wants to play again in a few days time as well.” Klopp claimed his call for players to “stay respectful” was not a dig at Everton, who visit Anfield on Sunday, Liverpool having lost Virgil van Dijk and Thiago Alcântara to serious injury at Goodison Park last season. He said: “All of a sudden it will be like: ‘Klopp wants Everton to do this.’ No I don’t. We are ready for each kind of challenge, just keep it within the big frame of rules and everything will be fine. I really wish them the best and that they shall stay in the league, but it’s a normal game, both teams want three points; let’s see who gets it.”",Sport/Football,Klopp glad that Gary Neville apologised for praising Manchester United fouls,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/klopp-glad-that-gary-neville-apologised-for-praising-manchester-united-fouls
4/23/2022,"The last time Steven Gerrard had to swallow four successive defeats was eight years ago, a time when he was still playing, patrolling the Liverpool midfield, dovetailing with Philippe Coutinho and his manager was Brendan Rodgers. That same autumn, an Aston Villa team led by Paul Lambert featuring Philippe Senderos, Carlos Sánchez and Kieran Richardson had just lost six Premier League games on the spin. On Saturday Coutinho will be on the pitch at Leicester’s King Power Stadium, where Gerrard will share the touchline with Rodgers as his Villa side seek to reverse a slide that has hampered their hopes of a top-half finish. A fifth straight league loss would represent uncharted territory for Gerrard, whose Rangers side won the Scottish Premiership title unbeaten last year. He is wise enough to acknowledge that pressure and stick from pundits is probably “in the post”. The obvious caveat is that Villa’s defeats came against clubs chasing European football (West Ham, Arsenal, Wolves and Tottenham). Gerrard recognises that such context softens the focus somewhat, but given that is a stage to which they wish to return, the way they have slipped to 15th, eight points above the relegation zone, does not sit well. “Whether it be out there now if we were playing you lot [the media] in an eight v eight game, I don’t like losing,” says Gerrard, looking towards the training pavilion at Bodymoor Heath. “I hope my players echo that and share that feeling. They are the feelings that drive you to change your current form and your current position in the table. I don’t like losing football matches. That’s how I am. I have been at clubs where normally you are not in this position. But I’m even more determined to prove that I can work in these situations. It wasn’t always rosy at Liverpool. We went through some real tough spells that I had to lead from the front to change those feelings and where we were. At Rangers we suffered at times. We had some bumps and runs of form that didn’t sit well with the supporters and with myself. I had to lead and change that. I knew it was going to be no different at Aston Villa.” It was only last month that Villa won three in a row, scoring nine goals without reply, and even in a 4-0 defeat by Tottenham last time out, a promising first half offered encouragement before they wilted. Gerrard, with his right hand, mimics a plane taking off. “I never turned up here thinking all of a sudden we were just going to rise up and challenge the top four and the top six within five or six months,” he says. “I took over a team that was on the back of a run of five defeats. I knew it wouldn’t work overnight. But my attitude and my drive hasn’t changed to what I want to do and what I believe I can do here, in terms of leading the club where I want to lead it.” Gerrard’s primary remit upon succeeding Dean Smith in November was to secure their top-flight status but there is a bigger picture. Leicester, who have won the Premier League and FA Cup in recent years and face Roma next week in the last four of the Europa Conference League, and another Midlands neighbour, Wolves, provide inspiration when it comes to disrupting the normal order. “In the medium and long term, we want to go and prove we can follow in the footsteps of a West Ham, Leicester or Wolves who have upset the top six, or gone and done ever so well in a cup competition where you can reward your supporters with some success.” For now, Villa and Gerrard cannot think too far down the line. “With the right decisions and the right support over the next couple of months I believe we’ll be a different and a better team when we attack next season,” he says. “At the moment we have to prove we’re still a good team now and that we’ve got real talent in the building that is capable of stringing wins together. We have proved it and we’ve got to prove it in the next seven games to put ourselves in a place where everyone around Aston Villa will be in a better mood.”",Sport/Football,‘I don’t like losing’: Steven Gerrard determined to steady ship at Villa,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/i-dont-like-losing-steven-gerrard-determined-to-steady-ship-at-villa
4/23/2022,"Ralf Rangnick has likened what Manchester United require to open-heart surgery, with the interim manager stating the club can be resuscitated if there is strong leadership in support of Erik ten Hag. Rangnick, who is due to take up a consultancy role but indicated on Friday he would step away if not wanted by the new manager, has been at Old Trafford for nearly six months. The team are sixth, three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham and fifth-placed Arsenal – who they face on Satur day – having played a game more, and the German is clear what must occur for United to be genuine title contenders again. “You don’t even need glasses to see and analyse where the problems are,” he said. “Now it’s about how do we solve them? It’s not enough to do some minor amendments – cosmetic things. In medicine you would say that this is an operation of the open heart. If this happens and everyone has realised that this has to happen and if people want to work together then it makes sense and I believe it doesn’t take two or three years to change those things. This can happen within one year. “For sure [strong leadership is needed]. This is something that not just one single person as a manager can do. With all respect to Jürgen [Klopp] and Pep [Guardiola] I’m sure that they didn’t do all the things themselves [at Liverpool and Manchester City]. There were also other people involved in those two clubs, people in certain positions, no matter what area it was, in order to rebuild and build something we want to build here. In all areas you have to have top people and they have to work together in a very close, reliable way.” Rangnick was asked why Ten Hag could succeed if predecessors of the pedigree of Louis van Gaal and José Mourinho could not. “All I heard from people who work with him is that he is a very good character, communicative, and does things himself,” he said. “Obviously he needs the assistance of all the people inside the club and he will get that and have the chance to mould a new team together with the scouting department and the board, which is necessary. The most vital part is that the club manages to get in the best possible players, and we have the attitude, the energy. We need positive energy for the new team and this is also important for the new manager.” Rangnick has a contract to continue as a consultant for the next two years yet admits he may leave in the close season. “It’s not a question about what’s written, it’s about what will happen in everyday life and business,” he said. “It’s also important how Erik ten Hag sees that. Does he like to speak with someone like myself? These are the things we haven’t spoken about. “I still see where we could develop. We have perfect training conditions, a great stadium, massive fan support, probably the best I’ve ever experienced apart from Schalke. Of course I would want to be part of the process that has to happen.” Paul Pogba is almost certain to depart and appears to have played his final United game because of the calf injury suffered in Tuesday’s loss at Liverpool. Rangnick said: “He won’t be available [at Arsenal] and most likely not for the rest of the games. It seems right now he will not renew his contract [so] it’s most likely he won’t be here any more next season.” The 63-year-old was asked why Pogba’s six years at the club have been so uneven. “It’s difficult to say,” Rangnick said. “He’s a player who won the World Cup with France, he’s such a good player that he was a regular starter for a team like France. We all know what kind of potential he has and what kind of good player he can be. “He was quite like a few other players struggling to get his best performance sustainably on the pitch for a team like Man United. This has not only been the case this season or in the last couple of weeks. As far as I remember it was also the case in earlier years.” Rangnick reprimanded Eric Bailly after the centre-back commented “please” to a comment on Instagram that stated he and Raphaël Varane should start, which would mean Harry Maguire being dropped. “If it’s true that should not happen in a football club no matter in which league,” Rangnick said.",Sport/Football,Ralf Rangnick: Manchester United need ‘open-heart surgery’ to recover,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/ralf-rangnick-manchester-united-need-open-heart-surgery-to-recover
4/23/2022,"All 205 league meetings between Liverpool and Everton have come in the top flight. Few have been as loaded with consequence for both ends of the table as the 206th, and whether there will be a 207th next season is an issue that concerns not only Frank Lampard. “Yes of course,” stated Jürgen Klopp, when asked whether he would miss the most-played derby in English football if it disappeared from the calendar. “We are all used to two clubs in the city and that is how it is. All around the derbies, it is slightly different this week because we played [Manchester] United, but usually the full week before you play Everton all the talk is about the derby. Of course I would [miss it].” Many in red, however, will revel in their local rivals’ predicament on Sunday. Lampard, not exactly popular at Anfield at the best of times, will experience his first Merseyside derby with Everton in the relegation zone should Burnley avoid defeat at home to Wolves earlier in the day. The prospect of an instant riposte appears remote. Liverpool’s pursuit of an unprecedented quadruple has gathered momentum in the past week with emphatic defeats of both Manchester clubs. They boast the best home record in the Premier League this season. No team have collected fewer points on the road than Everton, who have lost all six away matches under Rafael Benítez’s successor. Lampard is acutely aware of the expectation – when offered the chance to take a draw on Friday he said: “Of course I would!” – and what the continuation of the fixture means to his club. The Everton manager said: “I understand it. I have friends who are Evertonians and there are people I bump into. I bumped into a nice lady in London a couple of weeks ago who was an Evertonian. It was in a place I didn’t expect to see an Evertonian. It was on the Kings Road. We had a day or two off after the Manchester United game and I was having lunch with my wife and the lady came over. It isn’t just a one-off; it happens all the time since I got the job. Evertonians have come out of everywhere, so while that has not been a reminder, I am aware of the size of this club, it does makes you proud. “It is a club steeped in history, that families and generations adore, and I understand what a win will mean for them. It is twofold for me. Firstly it is obviously the points. The points are so crucial for us. If we were sitting in eighth or 10th I could think about what this might mean, I could walk through the blue half of the city and it would be great the next day. But at the moment I am just thinking about the points. It would be a great feeling to be able to give the fans that moment. There was Carlo’s [Ancelotti’s] win last season but we haven’t had enough of those.” Liverpool’s form demands appreciation irrespective of local rivalry, Lampard admits. “Nobody watching the first half against Manchester United could do anything but think: ‘Wow,’” he said. “If you love football, you love watching that. Speed, accuracy of pass, great quality levels, energy in the team, everything.” Klopp was diplomatic in his appraisal of Everton’s decline. The Liverpool manager said: “I think the situation got more and more difficult because of results and stuff like this. When Rafa was there, there was still some distance between Everton and the relegation zone and that was nothing to do with the way they played, it was just the way it developed. They had real injury problems this year. If you cannot use [Dominic] Calvert-Lewin for nearly a whole season it is massive blow – he is one of the best strikers in England for sure. Then he’s coming back and not having rhythm. You don’t have 12 of these players in your squad.” Lampard was involved in a heated exchange with Klopp the last time he managed at Anfield, with Chelsea in July 2020, when a behind-closed-doors fixture meant his words were heard clearly. “All of us get it wrong at times,” he reflected. “I’ve seen Jürgen since then and everything is fine. I wanted to say to him: ‘You’ve done it before!’ “I suppose as young managers it is one thing you try and keep a hold on, because you have the fire in your belly so much that sometimes it comes out not as you might want it. We all have our moments. I’ll be competitive on the line on Sunday because I want to win the game and I’m sure he will be the same. That is just the world we live in.”",Sport/Football,Lampard desperate to keep Everton up and the Merseyside derby alive,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/lampard-desperate-to-keep-everton-up-and-the-merseyside-derby-alive
4/23/2022,"Thomas Tuchel believes his players must run harder after three heavy home defeats but has denied that Chelsea’s recent struggles at Stamford Bridge are down to laziness. Chelsea, who have conceded 11 goals in their past three home games, are under pressure to raise their level before hosting West Ham on Sunday. They made more defensive errors during their 4-2 defeat to Arsenal last Wednesday and Tuchel, who also saw Brentford and Real Madrid run riot at Stamford Bridge this month, has been forced to consider whether the European champions have grown lazy. “Maybe … then it comes back to me because I should push them and make them alert,” he said. “It’s human to be tired, human to be more alert in a knockout game than a normal match. Sometimes it’s also good, the foundation to be able to play 60 games. “I remember at Mainz with one game a week and every game was like a cup final. On a Saturday, we gave 150% physically but also mentally, the players were drained until Tuesday. Once I stepped into being coach at Borussia Dortmund, I saw that players gave everything physically on a normal match but mentally it was not the same stress level as for players at Mainz. They were capable of playing more games. “It’s a thin line in judging – that’s why lazy is the wrong word. But it’s OK to feel less tension in a normal match in the Premier League and a home match than if you go to the Bernabéu. It’s normal because it is maybe less tension, less excitement, less pressure. But it cannot lead to being less alert. This can never happen.” Chelsea, five points clear of fourth-placed Tottenham, are ninth in the Premier League’s home table. “I don’t know what it is,” Tuchel said of his side’s disappointing form at Stamford Bridge. “If it was just the one thing, we would switch dressing rooms or take another hotel or something like this. “But that would maybe be more superstition than anything else. I have no solution but it’s also not the level that we want to produce in home games.”",Sport/Football,Tuchel denies laziness is to blame for Chelsea’s recent dip in home form,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/22/tuchel-denies-laziness-is-to-blame-for-chelseas-recent-dip-in-home-form
4/23/2022,"A virtual protest has taken place on China’s heavily monitored social media platforms, where netizens took turns to keep a censored video called the Voice of April alive and overwhelm censors. The six-minute short documentary is a collage of audio snippets of government official announcements, as well as residents’ descriptions of their sufferings during Shanghai’s strict lockdowns in the last three weeks. The video showed the city’s skyline presented without commentary and was mostly in black and white. The ending card of the video read: “Get better soon, Shanghai.” April is the cruelest month. 四月之声: voices of frustrations, outcries, lies, moments of truth, and love, and despair.Crying as I’m watching this.To download: https://t.co/I5pmyL9ZVUTo watch: https://t.co/YalfvPMYuB pic.twitter.com/ooS69x3ipL The video was quickly taken down from China’s internet, but it continued to spread on WeChat on Friday. Users found creative ways to circulate the video by embedding a QR code in a film poster, or directing others to cloud services to download it. In the past few days, creative netizens have produced numerous content to express their frustration. Some mixed the British band Slaves’ 2015 single Cheer Up London with a few defining images of the last three weeks of lockdown in Shanghai. Others changed the script of American comedy duo Key & Peele’s A Man Who Enjoys a Continental Breakfast and dubbed it in Shanghainese dialect, to imagine what it would look like when a Shanghai man was finally allowed to enjoy a nice breakfast after the lockdown was lifted. The rare show of defiance on Friday night came shortly after the authorities announced further strengthening of the lockdown in China’s most populous city – home to 25 million people and a key financial hub in mainland China. Despite the criticism, Shanghai is doubling down on its “dynamic clearance” to eradicate the spread of the virus, neighbourhood by neighbourhood. It is unclear how widespread such a movement has become on Chinese internet and beyond Shanghai, but analysts said Friday’s eruption of dissenting creativity is reminiscent of a similar episode in the early days of the Wuhan lockdown. In early March 2020, Chinese netizens used creative ways to keep a censored magazine profile of a Wuhan medical professional, Dr Ai Fen, circulating. “After weeks of draconian lockdown, there’s a sense of deep frustration and discontentment for residents of Shanghai, but also a sense of solidarity for those who were not in the middle of it,” said Dali Yang, a political scientist at the University of Chicago. “I am surprised that many who were reposting the video and other materials did not see the act as political.” He continued: “For the authorities, this collective action and the implied criticism of the lockdown, sends a potent message they’re working hard to censor. Our understanding of this act also needs to be considered with the localised acts of defiance and protest, in the beating of cooking utensils and the noncompliance with nucleic acid testing orders.” Hu Xijin, the former editor of nationalist tabloid the Global Times weighed in late on Friday night to justify the erasure of the video. He said the internet was invented by the west, so when it entered China it ought to be “sinofied”. He urged citizens to trust the government and remain confident in China’s resilience. The phrase, The Voice of April, has now been taken down on Weibo. But some Chinese netizens are posting images with quotes to indirectly express their dissatisfaction. In one entry, Jin Xing, one of Shanghai’s best-known TV talkshow hosts, posted a photo of Mao Zedong with the quote: “People in China and around the world, even our enemies, will use the performance of our work in Shanghai to examine whether our party has the ability to manage a big city and the whole country.” At times, the subtle show of defiance was poetic. One user commented, in response to the censoring of Voice of April, with a poem from TS Eliot’s The Waste Land: “April is the cruellest month, breedingLilacs out of the dead land, mixingMemory and desire, stirringDull roots with spring rain” But as censors rushed to take down explicitly critical content, users began to post materials that on the surface did not seem as controversial. For example, on WeChat, some have used a clip from one of China’s foreign ministry spokespeople, in which she said Chinese citizens have the right to free speech and freedom of thought. Others quoted the phrase from China’s zero-Covid policy to describe the cat-and-mouse game with the censors. “This is called ‘dynamic clearance’,” they wrote.",News/World news,‘Voice of April’: Chinese netizens get creative to keep censored film on social media,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/sound-of-april-chinese-netizens-get-creative-to-keep-censored-film-in-circulation
4/23/2022,"Boris Johnson is facing deepening peril over the Partygate scandal after a source said a fine had been issued for a second event attended by the prime minister, while senior Conservatives warned he could face a leadership challenge within weeks. On Friday evening, No 10 was forced to deny Johnson had received another fixed penalty notice (FPN) for a “bring your own booze” Downing Street garden party on 20 May 2020. In January, Johnson admitted attending the event – held during the first national lockdown when indoor and outdoor social mixing were banned – for about 25 minutes but claimed he “believed implicitly that this was a work event”. Johnson’s principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, is said to have invited up to 100 people to the “socially distanced” evening drinks. A source told the Guardian that at least one FPN was issued on Friday to a Downing Street official who attended the event. As Johnson finished a two-day trade trip to India on Friday, a spokesperson said he had not received a new fine. On Thursday the Metropolitan police announced it would not provide any updates on FPNs for Downing Street lockdown breaches until after next month’s local elections “due to the restrictions around communicating” ahead of the 5 May vote, though the criminal investigation and issuing of fines could continue. It came as senior party figures warned that Boris Johnson will probably face a leadership challenge if the Conservatives suffer significant losses at the May elections. The prime minister was told his support was being “eroded markedly” after the government capitulated to allow a third investigation into lockdown breaches, sparking renewed jostling among those vying to replace him. Allies of Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, and Penny Mordaunt, a trade minister, were said by MPs to have renewed discreet preparations for a leadership contest. During an overshadowed trade trip to India, Johnson admitted he had got a “pretty good kick” from his backbenchers after the government tried to force them to delay a third Partygate inquiry, by the privileges committee, only to U-turn hours later. He vowed to fight on, insisting he would still be prime minister in six months’ time. Meanwhile, infighting between his detractors and supporters spilled out into the open. Conor Burns, a Northern Ireland minister, dismissed criticism levelled at Johnson by some Tory backbenchers and said there were “colleagues across parliament who have never really supported the prime minister”. Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and elections expert, said MPs, councillors and Tory associations were fearful of the Partygate row stretching on indefinitely. “I expect that there will be some form of contest for leadership at some stage, not immediately,” he told the BBC. “But the support for the PM is being eroded quite markedly and has been since the recess.” Hayward suggested Johnson’s downfall would be “death by a thousand cuts” given the various investigations by Scotland Yard, the senior civil servant Sue Gray and now the Commons privileges committee. He revealed MPs were “looking around” to gauge who would be the most suitable replacement for Johnson and said: “They won’t necessarily admit it but that is the reality.” Hayward added: “I think they’re moving to a position, from whoever they started, to a position of saying ‘this cannot go on and there is only one way of resolving that and that is by saying we will need some form of challenge, leadership election, whatever it may happen to be’.” A cabinet source also predicted the local elections on 5 May could be as dire for the Conservatives as the 2019 European parliament elections, where the party won their lowest ever share of the vote. Iain Duncan Smith, a former Tory party leader, said many MPs had not grown any more hostile to Johnson because of the poor handling of the vote about the prime minister being investigated for misleading parliament. However, he told the Guardian: “We’ll wait to see what happens at the end of this. The majority of the public are sick and tired of the story; Conservative MPs are sick and tired of the story. “Colleagues may decide it is recoverable. If they reach the decision it’s too damaging, then it’s over. That balance is just sitting waiting. I fancy that the local elections and inquiry will put that to rest.” Steve Brine, a former health minister, was also revealed to have told a constituent that a confidence vote in Johnson “should take place … sooner rather than later”. He emailed: “This is not a sustainable situation and I suspect further FPNs will follow those issued last week. I will be liaising with senior colleagues to see that confidence is tested in the period ahead.” Robert Largan, the new Tory MP for High Peak in Derbyshire, the 14th most marginal seat in the country, also told constituents he would not “defend the indefensible”. “We cannot have a situation where it is one rule for politicians and another rule for everyone else,” he said. “I can assure you that I am taking the appropriate action to defend integrity in public life.” Rory Stewart, a former cabinet minister, also predicted the May elections would demonstrate Johnson “has lost his magic and the Conservative MPs will then conclude there is no point staying behind him”. Tory MPs who have submitted letters of no confidence in Johnson felt quietly optimistic that others would follow suit, and be given heart by the likes of senior backbenchers Mark Harper and Steve Baker calling on the prime minister to go this week. “They’ll just do it quietly or privately – until we’re left with these mad people who wouldn’t get anything under another regime,” one surmised. Another MP supportive of Johnson admitted: “It’s so unpredictable and all seems to have changed again. I’ve gone from thinking he should be safe to thinking ‘this is it’.” A Conservative MP who previously kept an open mind about Johnson’s future diagnosed the concerns about his political leadership as “terminal”. Winding up his two-day trip to India, an exasperated Johnson was unable to escape fresh questions about the Partygate row. He was adamant he would still be prime minister in October – when he hopes a free trade deal with India could be ready to sign – and insisted he was in India to discuss issues of interest to British voters. “I think what people want in our country is for the government to get on and focus on the issues on which we were elected, and that’s what we’re going to do – and I think they’ll be particularly interested in jobs and growth in the UK,” he said, going on to highlight cooperation with the Indian government on green energy and defence. In an odd outburst, responding to a question about whether he would compare himself to a cat with nine lives, he said: “We had a pretty good kick of the cat yesterday” but quickly added: “Not that I’m in favour of kicking cats.”",News/Politics,Johnson leadership doubts resurface amid report of fresh Partygate fine at event he attended,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/22/boris-johnson-leadership-second-partygate-fine-report
