3/12/2022,"A Ukrainian company that manufacturers medieval armor for sport is now using its materials to produce ""caltrops"" — or ""sharp, six-inch spikes that date back to ancient wars"" — in service of the war effort against Russia, The Washington Post reports. Art of Steel in western Ukraine used to make items like ""silver chain mail, helmets, and other armor for reenactments and show,"" but has instead in the past two weeks produced hundreds of caltrops, which are being chained together and ""placed at checkpoints around Rivne, a city about 210 miles west of Kyiv,"" writes the Post. The intent is for the devices, also called ""hedgehogs,"" to stop or slow Russian vehicles should they try to enter the city, since the metal can pierce tires. ""Ukrainians [are] united in this war,"" an Art of Steel official told the Post. ""Absolutely everyone is trying to help in the fighting places and in the rear. Therefore, any materials are somehow used."" ""With proper use,"" the caltrops ""will help stop [a] column of vehicles or at least delay them for a while,"" the official added. The Art of Steel hedgehogs are just one example of homegrown weaponry Ukrainians are using to defend themselves from Russian aggression. Some volunteers, for example, have begun packing bottles with the materials needed to make Molotov cocktails. The spiky weapons are now at every checkpoint in Rivne, Art of Steel said, per the Post. The company is also making plates for body armor.

3/12/2022,"By Nick Carey LONDON (Reuters) - Mercedes-Benz has 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in assets that could be threatened by Russian proposals to nationalise the property of foreign firms that leave because of its invasion of Ukraine, the German premium carmaker said. The company said in its annual report released on Friday that the war in Ukraine raised a range of risks from disruptions to parts to energy supply or even cyber attacks. ""These risks could be exacerbated by the potential expropriation of assets of Russian subsidiaries,"" Mercedes-Benz said. Russia's ruling party, United Russia, said this week a government commission had approved the first step towards nationalising the assets of firms more than 25% owned by foreigners from ""unfriendly states."" Mercedes-Benz has a car plant in the town of Esipovo 40 km (25 miles) northwest of Moscow with over 1,000 employees that produces E-class sedans and SUVs. It was opened in April 2019 with Russian President Vladimir Putin in attendance. It was the first plant in years to be opened by a foreign carmaker in Russia, where investment into the formerly burgeoning auto industry had dried up amid western sanctions and a stagnant economy. Speaking at the opening ceremony, Putin said the plant would produce 25,000 cars a year and that investment in the project had totaled just under $300 million. Mercedes-Benz said its Russian units, which were valued at 2 billion euros as of the end of 2021, have liabilities to banks of approximately 1 billion euros, for which the carmaker has issued a global guarantee.

3/12/2022,"Mila Kunis is opening up about the emotional toll recent events in Ukraine have taken on her. In a candid interview with Maria Shriver, the actress and activist spoke at length about the newfound pride she’s gained as a Ukrainian immigrant herself, why she’s making it a point to tell her kids they’re “half Ukrainian and half American” and why it’s important for Americans to separate the Russian people from those in power. “I was born in Ukraine. I came to the States in 1991 and we were the last of my family to migrate,” Kunis explains, adding that she was about 8 years old at the time. ""I very much have always felt like an American,” she continued, saying that growing up, “People were like, 'Oh, you're so Eastern European.' I was like, 'I'm so LA!’ What do you mean? Like, my whole life I was like ‘I am LA through and through.’” That all changed when Russia invaded Ukraine last month — an event Kunis says has changed how she embraces her Ukrainian identity. “[Russia’s invasion] happens and I can't express or explain what came over me, but all of a sudden I was like, 'Oh my God, I feel like a part of my heart just got ripped out,’” she explained. “It was the weirdest feeling.” That mindset extended to how she's explaining the situation with her children, daughter Wyatt, 7, and son Dimitri, 5, both of whom she shares with Ashton Kutcher. “It doesn’t take away from who I am as a person but it just adds an entire different layer,” she explains. ""I turned to my kids and I was like, 'You are half Ukrainian, half American!' Like, I literally was like, 'Look, you!” And my kids were like, 'Yeah mom, I get it.' And I was like, 'No! You are Ukrainian and American.' I was like, 'You are half Iowa, half Ukraine.' And they're like, 'Okay, I get it.’” “It's been irrelevant to me that I come from Ukraine. It never mattered,” she explained of her upbringing. “So much so that I've always said I'm Russian. Like I've always been, 'I'm from Russia' for a multitude of reasons. One of them being when I came to the States and I would tell people I’m from from Ukraine, the first question I’d get was ‘Where is Ukraine?’ And then I’d have to explain Ukraine and where it is on the map… But if I was like, ‘I’m from Russia’ people were like, ‘Oh we know that country.’ So I was like great I’ll just tell people from Russia.” “Hell no! I’m from Ukraine. Everything’s changed,” she says now. “It is a sense of pride, and it’s not taking away from loving where I live now and everything that this country has given me.” As far as Kunis’s message to the American people, one of the biggest points she wanted get across was to implore people to understand the difference between the Russian people and the Russian leaders. ""I don't think that we need to consider the people of Russia an enemy,” she explained. “I do really want to emphasize that. I don't think that that's being said enough in the press. I think that there's now, 'If you're not with us, you're against us' mentality. And I don't want people to conflate the two problems that are happening. I don't think it's the people of Russia … I do encourage people to look at it from the perspective of, 'It's the people in power, not the people themselves.’” ""I also don't want people to get discouraged and conflate different issues in the world, and I don't want people to compare,” she added. “I think that one thing that's happening a little bit that I've noticed is people are like, 'Why is everybody paying attention to this problem, but nobody paid attention to all these other issues that have been happening?' And I don't want people to conflate.” “Like everyone,” she concluded. “People just [need] to focus on what is at hand right now and right now this issue can get incredibly catastrophic for the rest of the world, not just for that part of the world, and I don't want people to lose sight of that."" Kunis and Kutcher have been putting their money and time where their mouth is. The couple recently hit a big milestone in their fundraising effort for Ukraine, raising $20 million in less than a week — just shy of $10 million from their original goal of $30 million, which they're confident they'll achieve sooner rather than later. ""Our goal's $30 [million] and we're gonna get there,"" Kutcher said in an update this week. ""But we do want to say thank you to the 56,000 of you who were able to donate and supported us. Whether it was the $5, $10, $1000, whatever it was, means so much to us because it does bring in a community and a sense of belonging and an ability to help,"" Kunis added. Their funds benefits Flexport and Airbnb, two organizations who are ""actively on the ground providing immediate help to those who need it most,"" Kunis said. ""There have been over 1 million children — this is just children — that are in refugee status right now,"" Kutcher added. ""Every bit we can do helps and we appreciate you.""

3/12/2022,"A picture purported to be of a fighter pilot apparently responsible for shooting down multiple Russian jets has been shared by Ukraine’s armed forces. The image shows a pilot - who has become known as the 'Ghost of Kyiv' - with their visor and oxygen mask sat in the cockpit of a MiG-29 fighter jet, pointing at the missiles loaded on the bottom of the wings. It is captioned with the words: ""Hello, occupier, I’m coming for your soul!” Reports of the ""Ghost"" have spread since Vladimir Putin began invading Ukraine two weeks ago. It is said the single fighter pilot is responsible for downing 10 Russian aircraft, an incredible feat by one person. The existence of the Ghost is disputed, with many arguing they are simply a myth or used as a term to describe the whole of the Russian Airforce. Whether real or fake, the rumour has bolstered the fighting spirit of a country which has so far been subjected to brutal attacks on heavily populated cities. The invasion has caused the biggest humanitarian crisis since World War Two - with over 2.5 million refugees fleeing Ukraine to neighbouring countries. Ukraine's ability to keep flying air force jets is a visible demonstration of the country's resilience in the face of attack and has been a morale booster, both to its own military and Ukraine's people, experts have said. Russia had by far the superior air force at the start of the invasion, but has yet to achieve control over the skies. Ukrainian armed forces have regularly posted pictures and videos of downed Russian aircraft, claiming to have downed 57 planes so far. However, their alleged success in shooting down planes has not stop the constant bombardment of cities across the country. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly asked his Western allies for a no-fly zone to be enforced over his country - calls which have so far been denied. Since then, in an apparent attempt at compromise, Zelenskyy has also called on the US to provide more warplanes so Ukraine could better defend itself. Calls for support were once again renewed on Wednesday after Russia was accused of bombing a maternity hospital in Mariupol, which Ukrainian authorities said killed three people including a child. Speaking on Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said bringing in the no-fly zone would cause direct conflict between Russia and Nato. Johnson said that while Vladimir Putin had abandoned “all norms of civilised behaviour”, conflict with Russia was something he was determined to avoid. Speaking on Sky New’s Beth Rigby Interviews, he acknowledged that some of his conversations with Mr Zelensky had been “deeply upsetting” as the Ukrainian leader appealed for more help. “What’s happened in Mariupol in that maternity hospital really shows that Putin is prepared just to reject, to abandon, all norms of civilised behaviour,” he said. Watch: Boris Johnson says it is ""deeply unsettling"" to refuse Ukraine's calls for a no-fly zone  “The difficulty is that there is a line beyond which, quite frankly, the UK and Nato would be deemed to be in conflict – direct conflict – with Russia. “It’s agonising. It’s absolutely agonising. And I’ve had this conversation at least a couple of times now with Volodymyr, but I think the difficulty is that it will require me to order RAF jets, UK pilots into the air with a mission to shoot down Russian fast jets. “I think we’ve got to be realistic… there’s a line that is very difficult to cross.” It comes amid reports that Russia is ""re-posturing"" for a renewed attack after failing to take control of Ukraine after coming up against fierce resistance.",News/Yahoo News UK,The Ghost of Kyiv: Ukraine shares picture of 'mythical' fighter pilot,https://news.yahoo.com/the-ghost-of-kyiv-ukraine-shares-picture-of-mythical-fighter-pilot-173834329.html
