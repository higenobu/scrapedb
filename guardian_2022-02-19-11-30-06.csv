2/19/2022,"Authorities have released new phone data, including unsent text messages pleading for help, in the case of the young California family killed by extreme heat during a hike in a remote area of the Sierra Nevada mountains last August. The new details surrounding the deaths of 45-year-old Jonathan Gerrish, his 35-year-old wife Ellen Chung, their one-year old daughter Aurelia “Miju” Chung-Gerrish and their dog Oski, were released on Thursday by the Mariposa County Sheriff’s Office, included family photos taken during the hike, text message and phone call attempts, and GPS locations.  The information sheds light on the family’s final hours on the trail, including that the couple attempted at least six phone calls and messages by 12.36pm. None went through because of poor cellular reception in the remote area. In one ultimately unsent message, Gerrish wrote: “[Name redacted], can you help us. On savage lundy trail heading back to Hites cove trail. No water [over] heating with baby.” Law enforcement officials announced last October that the family was killed by hyperthermia and a lack of water. “Using the information extracted from the phone we were able to re-create the path and timeline based on the GPS locations. The details found on the phone support the findings of a heat related incident,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement on Thursday. According to authorities, at 7:44am on 15 August, the couple took a photo and video just a few yards from the trail head. The couple then took a photo of the trail fifteen minutes later. Authorities found a photo of the Merced River taken an hour later at 9:05am. An additional ten photos were found on Gerrish’s phone that were taken between 9:35am and 10:16am which featured the river, the couple and selfie-style family photos. The last picture found on the phone was taken at 12:25pm and was a screenshot of the couple’s location from AllTrails, a hiking trail app. According to earlier police reports, a US Forest Service volunteer who hiked the nearly eight-mile loop over a dozen times told authorities that the family appeared “completely unaware of the dangers”. Records revealed that the couple only carried a sippy cup and a backpack with a 2.5-liter reservoir for water. “If you are hiking in triple degree temperatures you will need at least a liter of water for every hour you plan to be out,” Wesley Trimble, a communications and creative director with the American Hiking Society, previously told the Guardian. On the day of the family’s hike, the temperatures were in the high 70s during the morning and then quickly rose to 109 in the afternoon while they were on the trail. When officials found the family’s bodies on 17 August, the sheriff’s department described the case as an “unusual, unique situation” due to the absence of evident signs of death. In the months that followed, authorities considered but ultimately ruled out various causes of death, including carbon monoxide poisoning, exposure to gas from surrounding mines, a lightning strike, suicide and drugs. In Thursday’s statement, Sheriff Jeremy Briese said, “The cell phone data results were the last thing both the family and detectives were waiting on. The extracted information confirms our initial findings. I am very proud of my team and our partner agencies for all the work they put in. Their dedication has allowed us to close this case and answer lingering questions the family had, bringing them a little peace.”",News/US news,Phone data shows California family made numerous calls for help on fatal hike,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/18/phone-data-california-family-calls-help-fatal-hike
2/19/2022,"The New South Wales government has promised a “manufacturing renaissance” in the state to help workers who will lose their jobs as a result of coal-fired power plant closures. The state’s treasurer, Matt Kean, responding to the early closure of the Eraring power station in Lake Macquarie in 2025, announced a jobs package that would create 3,700 roles in clean industries.  It included 2,700 construction jobs associated with delivery of transmission infrastructure that is needed to connect new sources of generation such as the renewable energy zones in the New England and Central West Orana regions and the Hunter transmission project. The state will invest $250m over five years to boost local manufacturing of components for the renewables sector such as wind towers, electrolysers and batteries, which Kean said would create a further 500 jobs. An additional $300m would be spent over 10 years to create 500 more jobs to expand the state’s clean manufacturing base – in particular the green hydrogen industry – via programs that were established as part of the state’s net zero strategy. “We know some existing industries face challenges as the world decarbonises,” Kean said. “That’s why we need to make sure the low carbon economy thrives in NSW to create the jobs of tomorrow.” Kean said the replacement of ageing energy infrastructure would create a once in a generation investment boom around the world. “I want to turn it into a manufacturing renaissance for NSW, particularly our industrial heartland,” he said. Saturday’s announcement builds on an earlier promise made on Thursday to build the “biggest battery in the southern hemisphere” to support transmission lines. Origin Energy’s decision to bring forward the closure of the Eraring power station by seven years shocked some workers when it was announced on Thursday, unions have said. Warrick Jordan, the coordinator of the Hunter Jobs Alliance – a coalition of unions and environment groups – said the challenges for the Hunter had been recognised and the priority now was the pace at which new investment occurred. Companies have already shown strong interest in investment in the Hunter renewable energy zone, with the government confirming this week it had received expressions of interest worth more than $100bn. “Downstream manufacturing and renewables and hydrogen components manufacturing are exactly the type of jobs we need to attract to the Hunter,” Jordan said. “We need to get the right policy and investment and we need to get moving otherwise we’ll miss out on those jobs and they will go offshore.” Jordan said the government’s announcements were a welcome start. “This is a good investment because it starts to provide real and tangible job opportunities and put infrastructure on the ground,” he said. “It won’t happen overnight and there’s a critical imperative to make sure as many jobs as possible are located in the Hunter.” Sam Mella, the Hunter program manager for Beyond Zero Emissions, said the state was embracing sustainable job opportunities in clean industries. “The NSW government has acted swiftly and this investment will help create thousands of jobs in clean industries and renewables concentrated in the Hunter Valley when we need them,” Mella said. WWF-Australia said it demonstrated that energy and manufacturing jobs could thrive in the regions when governments showed leadership. “It is a big step towards the Hunter and Central Coast becoming a centre of renewable-powered manufacturing,” said Nicky Ison, WWF-Australia’s energy transition manager.",News/Australia news,NSW treasurer Matt Kean unveils clean energy jobs to combat losses from Eraring power station closure,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/19/nsw-treasurer-matt-kean-unveils-clean-energy-jobs-to-combat-losses-from-eraring-power-station-closure
