2/14/2022,"Making sense of the stock markets is a challenge – and a straightforward task. The collective information generated tens of thousands of stocks and traders gives investors everything they need to know – but sorting through that mountain of raw data presents a whole nother issue. TipRanks makes it easy. The platform and data tools let investors put some order on the data vortex, bringing up the latest scoop on more than 9,600 stocks and 7,700 Wall Street analysts. For investors seeking a more refined tool, there is the Smart Score, a valuable data tool that aggregates 8 separate key factors for every stock, factors which are known to correlate with future returns, and uses them to create a reified score on a scale of 1 to 10. A stock with a ‘Perfect 10’ scores high on most of the key factors – although a stock doesn’t need to score high on every factor to get a 10. The Smart Score, and especially the 10s, can guide investors toward the stocks that are primed for gains. That’s a vital advantage, especially in a challenging market environment like the last six weeks have shown us. With this in mind, we've pulled up two stocks with a ‘Perfect 10’ from the Smart Score, which have outperformed the broader market this year. Let's take a closer look. Schlumberger Limited (SLB) We’ll start with a company that combines the strengths of two major industries. Schlumberger is an oil field services company, a firm involved the drilling, well completion, and oil production of hydrocarbon business. These are tasks that the major oil companies – with their own focus on exploration – sometimes cannot do well. By specializing, Schlumberger can fill a vital niche in a vital industry. A combination of factors, including the corona pandemic crisis and the Biden Administration’s policy de-emphasis on fossil fuels, has put serious headwinds in front of Schlumberger. A macro look at revenue tells the story. The top line for the full year 2019 came in at $33 billion; that was down to $23.6 billion in 2020, and $22.9 billion in 2021. At the same time, Schlumberger’s earnings and share price have both recovered to pre-pandemic levels. At the bottom line, EPS for 4Q21 came in at 42 cents; this was up 8% from Q3 and an impressive 56% year-over-year. While full-year revenues remained down, the quarterly top line of $6.22 billion was the best print since 1Q20. Accordingly, the company’s share price is up 36% this year, far outpacing the overall market. Turning to the Smart Score, Schlumberger earns its ‘Perfect 10’ with bullish readouts on 7 of 8 key factors. Hedge funds and individual investors are all buying in, and the industry bloggers and news sentiment are both highly positive. Among the bulls is Evercore analyst James West who takes a detailed look at this company, and sees it in a strong position for the near future. “Schlumberger’s returns-focused strategy is clearly working as the company brilliantly executed a choppy 2021 and is set for a major inflection as the upcycle takes hold in 2022 and beyond. The company remains focused on delivering returns above the cost of capital, moving margins and free cash flow higher, and leveraging its technology leadership position,” West opined. These comments support West’s Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating here, and his $48 price target implies a one-year upside of 18%. (To watch West’s track record, click here) West isn’t alone in his bullish stance. There’s broad agreement on Wall Street about Schlumberger’s positives, as shown by the 14 to 1 breakdown Buy reviews versus Holds. Shares are selling for $39.17 and their $44 average price target suggests an upside of 12% in the next 12 months. (See SLB stock analysis on TipRanks) Euroseas, Ltd. (ESEA) Now we’ll shift our focus, from hydrocarbon to shipping. Euroseas is a shipping company, in business for over a century, focuses on oceangoing haulage. The company operates a fleet comprised of intermediate- and feeder-sized container carriers, 16 in all. The vessels range from 18,000 dry weight tonnage to more than 70,000 tonnes. The oldest vessels date to the late 90s, while the newest are from 2009. Euroseas has four new ships under construction, with staggered deliveries scheduled to start in 1Q23 and continue to 1Q24. Euroseas has benefited from the post-lockdown return to more open economic activity, especially from the resumption of global trade. While the supply chain crisis does impact the company, higher freight rates are boosting the bottom line. The company will report its 4Q21 results on February 15; a look back at the Q3 numbers may serve to show the general trends. The company posted a top line of $23 million, and EPS of $1.17. Revenues were up 86% year-over-year, while the earnings had turned around from a mere 1-cent gain in the year-ago quarter. On a negative note, EPS missed the $1.41 expected. These occasional misses in otherwise strong results could help explain the pattern in the share price: a rising trend, with periods of volatility. Overall, ESEA shares have gained ~29% this year. The share gains reflect the company’s solid position in the reopened global trade routes. Maxim analyst Tate Sullivan likes what he sees in Euroseas, especially in the company’s potential to convert cash into ships. He writes, “Based on $103.5M of contracted EBITDA in 2022 and our estimates for future TCE rates on ships that have expiring contracts, we estimate ESEA increases cash to $83M in 2022 from $8.8M in 4Q21E. In fact, we now forecast ESEA has more cash than debt by the end of 2023... Without higher costs and a net cash balance, ESEA can consider acquiring more ships, initiating a dividend, or repurchasing shares.” To this end, Sullivan gives ESEA shares a Buy rating, and puts a $52 price target on the stock, indicating room for a robust 68% upside ahead. (To watch Sullivan’s track record, click here) While there are only 2 reviews on record for Euroseas – this small-cap shipper has slipped under the radar – they both agree that it’s a Buy and give the shares a Moderate Buy consensus view. ESEA is trading for $32.04 and its $51.50 average target implies an upside of ~6`1% from that level.

2/14/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- The Federal Reserve faces a growing risk of making a policy mistake, tipping the economy into a recession, as it confronts decades-high inflation that’s proving more persistent and broad-based than policy makers expected. Most Read from Bloomberg Covid’s Great Uncoupling: Gap Widens Between Cases and Deaths Biden-Putin Call Is Inconclusive as Ukraine Tensions Deepen U.K. Hospital Patient Dies From Confirmed Case of Lassa Fever Zelenskiy Invites Biden; Scholz Prepares Visit: Ukraine Update Singapore’s Young Super-Rich Snap Up the Island’s Priciest Homes After holding interest rates near zero since the start of the pandemic, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his colleagues are poised to embark on a credit-tightening campaign next month, with some economists forecasting an outsized half percentage-point increase to start the cycle. The danger is that, with price gains far above its 2% target, the Fed will be pressured into overdoing it -- pushing the economy into a downturn by rapidly raising borrowing costs for consumers and companies, and cratering financial markets that have grown used to its ultra-expansionary monetary policy. At the same time, fiscal policy also will be acting as a damper on growth. As prices for everything from gasoline to rent have surged, support has waned for President Joe Biden’s push to reshape the economy by strengthening social investments, with his poll numbers sliding. Economists from both sides of the political spectrum see rising risks of a recession. Former Fed Governor Lawrence Lindsey, who served in the White House under Republican President George W. Bush, puts the odds of a downturn by the end of next year at above 50% -- triggered by a meltdown on Wall Street. “When you’re wrong in one direction and you’re painfully wrong, you’re going to have to end up with too much heavy lifting to go in the other direction,” Lindsey, who now heads his own consulting firm, said of what he sees as the Fed’s delay in recognizing and responding to the budding inflation problem. Ex-Treasury Secretary and Democrat Lawrence Summers agreed. “The Fed has allowed itself to get far further behind the curve” in battling inflation, Summers, who is a paid Bloomberg TV contributor, said. “The risk a recession will start in the next 30 months is certainly 50%.” Six Hikes Traders in the money markets are wagering on roughly six quarter percentage-point increases by the Fed this year. Layered on top of those hikes will be a yet-to-be-specified reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet, which now stands at $8.9 trillion. That will take liquidity out of the financial system -- potentially unsettling bond and stock markets. “I don’t think we’ve priced in balance-sheet tightening really in the equity market at all,” Bloomberg Intelligence chief equity market strategist Gina Martin Adams said. “We’ve just barely started talking about it.” For his part, Powell is betting that a judicious tightening of monetary policy, combined with an easing of supply-chain bottlenecks and the winding down of the federal government’s pandemic-relief programs, will help rein in inflation without upending the economic expansion. But he’s acknowledged that he’s been surprised by the potency of the price pressures, and he’s vowed the Fed will do what it takes to prevent elevated inflation from becoming embedded in the economy. What’s caught the Fed on the hop is not just how much inflation has accelerated: Consumer prices soared at a 7.5% year-on-year rate in January, the fastest in four decades. It’s also been the breadth of the price increases. About 90% of the components that make up the consumer price index are running above 2% -- the Fed’s official inflation target, according to calculations by Bloomberg Economics. That’s “a cause for somewhat greater concern,” said former Fed official David Wilcox, who is now director of U.S. economic research at Bloomberg Economics. “That gives rise for more of an inflationary psychology to become entrenched.” In a sign of the widening inflationary pressures, home and car insurer Allstate Corp. has boosted rates by an average 7.1% across 25 states, and is planning further increases. “We are continuing to go at a very fast pace across other states,” senior Allstate executive Glenn Shapiro told Wall Street analysts in a Feb. 3 conference call. “And even in some cases, the same states again with rate increases, as we get new data and new trends.” Powell has also flagged stepped-up wage increases as something to watch. “We are attentive to the risks that persistent real wage growth in excess of productivity could put upward pressure on inflation.” he told reporters on Jan. 26. The tight labor market -- at 4%, the unemployment rate is below the level that prevailed for much of the previous expansion -- has led employers to bid up wages in an attempt to fill millions of job openings and to retain workers. Last year, compensation costs surged by the most in two decades. “As you go into this year, we are expecting that there is going to continue to be pressure on wages,” McDonald’s Corp. Chief Executive Officer Chris Kempczinski said in a Jan. 27 earnings call. “Certainly, as we’re thinking about our pricing, we’re thinking about how do we put pricing that can anticipate that.” The trouble for Powell and the Fed is that the central bank will be tightening policy to slow the economy and reduce inflation just as the expansion will be downshifting on its own, after growth last year clocked in at the fastest since 1984. “The Fed is tightening into a slowdown,” Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, said. “That does point to some risks around if they go too fast.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek The Billion-Dollar Nickel-Swap Scandal That Shocked Singapore The Loan Shark Trump Freed From Prison Is Lending Money Again The Brothers Behind a Wedding Tent Empire Know When to Say Yes There Are Now 1,000 Unicorn Startups Worth $1 Billion or More Why Airbus Is Canceling Orders From Qatar Airways, One of Its Best Customers ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•2 days ago,Fed Rush to Catch Up on Inflation Raises U.S. Recession Risks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-rush-catch-inflation-raises-143000793.html
2/14/2022,"Mortgage rates were on the move in the 2nd week of February, after barely shifting for 3 consecutive weeks. In the week ending 10th February, 30-year fixed rates jumped by 14 basis points to 3.69%. 30-year fixed rates had remained unchanged at 3.55% in the week prior. As a result, 30-year fixed rates held above the 3% mark for a 13th consecutive week. Compared to this time last year, 30-year fixed rates were up by 96 basis points. 30-year fixed rates were still down by 125 basis points, however, since November 2018’s last peak of 4.94%. It was a quiet first half of the week, with economic data limited to December trade data. The numbers had a muted impact on U.S Treasury yields ahead of inflation figures on Thursday. January nonfarm payrolls from the previous week supported the rise in mortgage rates in the week. The weekly average rates for new mortgages as of 10th February were quoted by Freddie Mac to be: 30-year fixed rates jumped by 14 basis points to 3.69% in the week. This time last year, rates had stood at 2.73%. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.8 points. 15-year fixed rates surged by 16 basis points to 2.93% in the week. Rates were up by 74 basis points from 2.19% a year ago. The average fee rose from 0.7 points to 0.8 points. 5-year fixed rates increased by 9 basis point to 2.80%. Rates were up by 1 basis point from 2.79% a year ago. The average fee remained unchanged at 0.3 points. According to Freddie Mac, Economy normalization continues, with mortgage rates surging to the highest level since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Freddie Mac expects rate increases to continue due to high inflation and strong labor market conditions. The combination will likely have an adverse impact on homebuyer demand. For the week ending 4th February, the rates were: Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances rose from 3.78% to 3.83%. Points decreased from 0.41 to 0.40 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates backed by FHA increased from 3.86% to 3.93%. Points decreased from 0.55 to 0.54 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 3.59% to 3.62%. Points rose from 0.31 to 0.35 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, which is a measure of mortgage loan application volume, slid by 8.1% in the week ending 4th February. The Index had jumped by 12% in the previous week. The Refinance Index slid by 7% from the previous week and was 52% lower than the same week a year ago. In the week prior, the Index had surged by 18%. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased from 57.3% to 56.2%. In the previous week, the share had increased from 55.8% to 57.3%. According to the MBA, Mortgage rates continued to move higher, tracking the 10-year yield, as the markets responded to growing inflationary pressures. The FED and other key global central banks signaled that they will start removing accommodative policies, driving yields higher. Purchase activity slowed, while the average loan size hit another record high at $446,000. It’s a busier start to the week for the U.S markets. Wholesale inflation figures will be in focus early in the week ahead of retail sales data on Wednesday. Expect last week’s U.S inflation figures and this week’s stats to provide mortgage rates with further direction.

2/14/2022,"The deal went through swiftly - and almost immediately prompted calls for a national security review. Just three months after Chinese-state-owned Zijin Mining Group announced its US$960 million plans to buy Canadian miner Neo Lithium, the proposal was signed, screened and delivered. At a corporate level, the deal made sense. Neo Lithium's biggest mine operation is in Argentina, where Zijin already has interests and plans to build a lithium carbonate plant. Canadian officials also said carmakers in North America were unlikely to use lithium produced so far away. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. But lithium is an essential mineral and the speed of the deal raised calls from lawmakers and security experts in Canada that such agreements with Chinese companies should be subjected to more thorough review. The backlash highlights growing concerns in the West over China's control of supply chains for strategic minerals as well as a divide between national interests and corporate priorities. Neo Lithium has a major operation in Argentina. Photo: Neo Lithium alt=Neo Lithium has a major operation in Argentina. Photo: Neo Lithium> That divide is particularly apparent in Africa, where the mining sector was previously dominated by European and American firms but has slowly given way to Chinese companies, including Huayou Cobalt, Chengtun Mining, and China Molybdenum. One example is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, home to 60 per cent of the world's reserves of cobalt, an essential component of batteries for electric vehicles, smartphones, tablets and laptops. American company Freeport-McMoRan used to have extensive interests in the DRC but has since sold its stakes to China Molybdenum. It started in 2016 when China Molybdenum bought Tenke-Fungurume Mining, owner of the world's second-largest cobalt mine, from Freeport-McMoRan. Then in 2020, the Chinese company bought Freeport-McMoRan's indirect 95 per cent interest in the Kisanfu copper-cobalt deposit for US$550 million. Further south in Zimbabwe, Shanghai-listed battery material producer Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt announced in December that it would buy the Arcadia hard-rock lithium mine, owned by Australia-based battery minerals company Prospect Resources, for US$422 million, subject to regulatory approval. The Zimbabwean project aims to process 2.4 million tonnes of lithium ore per year. Huayou has also operated two copper and cobalt mines in the DRC since 2007 and is investing in four nickel and cobalt projects in Indonesia. And last year China's lithium giant Ganfeng Lithium acquired half of Netherlands-based SPV, whose subsidiary Lithium du Mali owns a spodumene project called Goulamina in the West African nation of Mali. Chinese companies also have mining interests in Namibia, Zambia, and Ghana for key metals such as lithium. That transition has not been without concerns in the countries themselves. The Congolese government has plans to renegotiate contracts with Chinese companies, saying its resources have not benefited its people. A US$6 billion ""infrastructure for minerals"" deal with Chinese investors - signed in 2008 under former president Joseph Kabila - is under review. The shift is also raising alarm in Washington, where the House of Representatives passed the China-focused America Competes bill on February 4. The sprawling bill aims to increase US competitiveness with China and address the country's shortage of semiconductors by strengthening the country's supply chain, ""eliminating national reliance on minerals and mineral materials that are subject to supply disruptions"". The US, as well as other Western countries such as Australia and Canada, want to secure supply chains for the minerals that power important industries such as communications, aerospace and defence, and clean technology. But many of the Western corporate players in those fields have exited for commercial reasons. ""We keep on seeing Chinese companies acquiring Western companies to the dismay of their governments,"" said Christian Geraud Neema, an independent Congolese mining and policy analyst. ""What makes sense for politicians doesn't always make sense for corporations. They can't expect them to understand their political views if they don't take into account the economic needs of these corporations."" He said corporations were profit-driven entities that were more worried about the costs, risks of each operation, and the benefits they made on the entire value chain. And the political and reputational risks of doing business in a corrupt country like the DRC outweighed the benefits of operating there. He said there were many other opportunities further down the supply chain from extraction and processing for Western companies to add value and profit. ""This would explain why they would let Chinese corporations work in these environments knowing that they're not under the same level of public scrutiny. [Chinese companies] can deal with corrupt governments without any real risk of backlash in their country,"" he said. Leaving Chinese companies on the ground and then cooperating with them down on the supply chain was a much safer choice for many Western players, Neema said. This reasoning played a big part in Canada's decision to approve the Zijin Mining takeover of Neo Lithium. Addressing the Canadian parliament last month, Industry Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Neo Lithium was not part of a bigger Canadian lithium mining and processing chain. Neema said: ""Where the Chinese ones are part of a big national strategy and can receive, when necessary, support from the [Communist Party], Western corporations face different constraints and realities. This is why I believe US lawmakers passed the America Competes bill to create a competitive environment for their mining corporation."" Gregory Miller, an analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said the West's market-based approach to strategic minerals had driven the relinquishment of African assets to Chinese companies. ""This short-termism led Western miners to seek to offload African assets during the period of declining commodity prices post-2008,"" Miller said. He said diminishing returns created a greater aversion to operating in more challenging jurisdictions; at a time when China's state-led industrial policy was leading Chinese companies to secure new mines across the globe. Miller said Western governments had become increasingly conscious of the risks posed by Chinese-controlled supply chains, particularly in the wake of the global semiconductor shortage. However, for now, it had yet to lead to substantial action. ""So, while the US may certainly be weighing up a return to the mining industry in an attempt to challenge Chinese hegemony, without imminent state-led action it will likely be a case of too little too late,"" Miller said. Jacqueline Musiitwa, an international lawyer and environmental, social and governance adviser with mining sector experience, said a number of the Chinese mining investment companies had the added attraction of being able to negotiate cheap debt and ""infrastructure for minerals"" deals. African countries such as the DRC found the model appealing because of the immediate construction of roads, hospitals and other needed infrastructure in exchange for a shareholding in mines, she said. That said, China's investment tactics in Africa were shifting, Musiitwa said. ""The seemingly unscrupulous investments have led to concerns about undue public debt that have put that model under increasing scrutiny,"" she said. Musiitwa said while a lot of focus has been put on the need for critical materials for electric cars, the US needed them for a variety of reasons including that they were relevant for national security. Chris Berry, president of commodities advisory firm House Mountain Partners in New York, said car companies were now focused on securing critical raw materials such as lithium and cobalt closer to their home markets. For example, Tesla was looking to secure nickel from a project in Minnesota and General Motors was hoping to secure lithium from a geothermal project in California, Berry said. ""There is also a huge move on the part of European automotive players and the European Union government to locally source critical raw materials,"" he said.
