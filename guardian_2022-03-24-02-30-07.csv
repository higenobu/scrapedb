3/24/2022,"The second round of senators’ questioning of Ketanji Brown Jackson kicked off on Wednesday after a marathon 13-hour judiciary committee hearing with the supreme court nominee the day before. The latest hearing began with a review of the previous day’s proceedings, as the Democratic chairman, Dick Durbin, criticized some of his Republican colleagues over their questioning of Jackson. “For many senators, yesterday was an opportunity to showcase talking points for the November election. For example, all Democrats are soft on crime. Therefore, this nominee must be soft on crime,” Durbin said. He told Jackson, “Well, you’ve made a mess of their stereotype.” At Tuesday’s hearing, the Republican senator Josh Hawley argued Jackson had given lenient sentences to child abuse images offenders. Durbin cited fact-checks showing Jackson’s sentencing practices were fairly typical for federal judges, and he noted she had been endorsed by a number of law enforcement groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police. After Durbin’s opening statement, the Republican senator John Cornyn accused the chairman of attempting to “editorialize” the hearing by offering comments after each Republican member’s questioning. “It’s called chairman’s time,” Durbin replied to Cornyn. “We waited through chairman’s time when we had Republican chairs. There will not be a separate set of rules for Democrats in control of this committee.” The senators’ sparring underscored how contentious and partisan supreme court nominations have become. Despite Jackson’s sterling credentials, it remains unclear whether her nomination will attract a single Republican vote of support. In comparison, the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer was confirmed with a bipartisan vote of 87 to 9 in 1994. Lindsey Graham, a Republican member of the judiciary committee, had previously been considered a potential yes vote for Jackson’s confirmation because he supported her nomination to the DC circuit court last year. But on Wednesday, Graham made clear he is very unlikely to support Jackson’s supreme court nomination. Graham and Jackson engaged in a contentious back-and-forth about her sentencing in child abuse images cases. As he went over his allotted questioning time by more than 10 minutes, Graham repeatedly interrupted Jackson to accuse her of failing to properly punish child abuse image offenders, saying her sentences were “making it easier for the children to be exploited”. Jackson appeared to grow visibly frustrated with Graham’s questioning, and she argued that judges have a responsibility to be “rational in our dealing with some of the most horrible kinds of behavior”. “This is what our justice system is about. It’s about judges making determinations in meting out penalties to people who have done terrible things,” Jackson told Graham. “Senator, every person in all of these charts and documents I sent to jail because I know how serious this crime is.” Before Graham’s outburst, the Democrat Jon Ossoff was the first senator who posed questions to Jackson on Wednesday. Ossoff and Republican Thom Tillis were the only two senators on the 22-member judiciary committee who did not have an opportunity to question Jackson on Tuesday. Ossoff asked Jackson to tell members about her brother, Ketajh Brown, a veteran and former Baltimore police department officer. Jackson recounted how her brother chose to become a police officer after graduating from the historically Black Howard University in Washington. “He could have done many things coming out of college with a college degree, but decided he wanted to be a police officer,” Jackson said. “It was a very stressful period for us as a family because – as proud as we are of his service, as much as we know it’s important – law enforcement is a dangerous profession. And as family members, you worry.” Jackson also offered Ossoff more details about her 2019 ruling that Don McGahn, Donald Trump’s former White House counsel, had to comply with a subpoena from the House judiciary committee. In her ruling, Jackson summarily dismissed Trump’s claims of executive privilege, writing, “Stated simply, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings.” On Wednesday, Jackson stood by her ruling in the case, underscoring the importance of the separation of powers in the US government. “Our constitutional scheme, the design of our government is erected to prevent tyranny,” Jackson said. “The separation of powers is crucial to liberty. It is what our country is founded on.” After Ossoff and Tillis wrapped up, every member of the committee was given the opportunity to engage in a second, shortened round of questioning. Despite the many questions left for Jackson to face, Democrat Pat Leahy voiced optimism about her ultimate confirmation, emphasizing: “You will become a member of the US supreme court.”",News/US news,Ketanji Brown Jackson returns for second round of Senate questioning,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/23/ketanji-brown-jackson-senate-questioning-second-round-republicans
3/24/2022,"In the nine years she has volunteered at the Ward End Elim church food bank in Birmingham’s Hodge Hill, Pam Woolridge has never known so many people to be struggling. The constituency in the east of Birmingham has the highest fuel poverty rate in England at 27.4%, much higher than the national average of 13.4%, so many were hoping for a lifeline in Rishi Sunak’s spring budget announcement on Wednesday. “It’s just getting worse and worse, our numbers are going up massively. People have struggled throughout the pandemic, but now it’s the fuel poverty,” she said. “We’ve had people come here who have had no money to feed their meter, and they have no electricity, and when they get to us they’re really hungry. People do not have the money to budget and benefits are not going up, but everything else is. “We see, week in, week out, people who are scared for the future.” She said the government’s piecemeal approach to tackling issues was making little impact. The chancellor’s announcement of an extra £500m for the household support fund to help struggling families was “a tiny drop in the ocean”, she said. Plans such as raising the national insurance threshold would have no effect for the poorest in society, she added. “The people we see are not paying national insurance anyway, and they’re still not getting enough money to feed their [energy] meters, which is the poorest people on the highest tariffs.” The Labour MP for the constituency, Liam Byrne, said the budget would mean “colder homes for kids and pensioners, and longer queues for food banks”. “Rishi Sunak had a choice today about who to help and, incredibly, he decided to help the richest. Two-thirds of the cut in national insurance [will] go to the lucky top half of society,” he said. “This was quite simply a budget that failed to rise to the new challenges of a post-Covid, war-ravaged global economy and a country still struggling to adjust to Brexit.” On a busy shopping street in the centre of Hodge Hill, it was rising fuel and food costs on most people’s minds. “Everything has gone sky high, it’s terrible. I don’t know how people are going to be able to afford it. There’s going to be a lot of crime happening I think,” said Ali Zaman, 30, a supermarket worker. “Even if you go down to Tesco, milk has gone up. It’s everything.” He said that while cutting fuel duty by 5p a litre would help, it wouldn’t go far enough for people who were really struggling. “It’s good to see that but I don’t know how much difference it will make,” he said. Woolridge also stressed that rising fuel costs were going to have a huge impact on low earners. “Some people are not even going to be able to afford to go to work, because there is not enough salary coming in to heat their homes or fill their cars,” she said. Linda McGowan, 69, said she and her husband, both pensioners, had stopped using their car as much because of rising fuel prices. She had hoped the spring budget would include measures to boost pensions but was not surprised they did not get much of a look-in. “I know pensions did go up previously but it wasn’t much,” she said. “We’re just not going to be able to manage on how much we get. We are very worried about it, and I think a lot of people are really struggling. “I know the weather is getting warmer, but if you’re a pensioner and you’re stuck in all day and you need the heating on, where is the money going to come from?” Back at Elim church, a queue started to form outside the building shortly before doors opened at 1pm. One of three branches of the Aston and Nechells food bank, it has handed out 197 food parcels so far this year, up from 145 during the same period last year, and is only expecting numbers to rise when energy price rises hit in April. “We can only prepare so much. All of our food is donated and we’re seeing fewer donations coming because people can’t afford it any more,” she said. “It does seem as if there’s a disconnect between the government and reality,” said Keith, another volunteer at the food bank. “It’s almost as if they live in a bubble of their own, they aren’t seeing what is actually happening. It needs fixed and it needs fixed as soon as possible for the sake of the future of the country.”",News/UK news,‘A drop in the ocean’: Birmingham responds to Sunak’s mini-budget,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/a-drop-in-the-ocean-birmingham-responds-to-sunaks-mini-budget
3/24/2022,"Protests have taken place during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Caribbean tour, with the royal family accused of having historically benefited from the slave trade and the British empire. But what exactly are the monarchy’s historical links to slavery? The royal family’s links date back to the 16th century. In 1562, John Hawkins was the first known English person to include enslaved Africans in his cargo, a journey that was approved by Elizabeth I. The enslaved Africans were traded for goods including ginger and sugar. In 1564, Hawkins arranged another voyage, for which Elizabeth I funded a vessel. In 1660, the Royal African Company was established by the Duke of York, who later became James II, with involvement from his brother, Charles II. The Royal African Company was prolific within the slave trade; according to the Slave Voyages website, between 1672 and 1731 the Royal African Company transported more than 187,000 slaves from Africa to English colonies in North, Central and South America. Many of the enslaved Africans transported by the Royal African Company were branded “DY”, standing for Duke of York. Between 1690 and 1807, an estimated 6 million enslaved Africans were transported from west Africa to the Americas on British or Anglo-American ships. The slave trade was protected by the royal family and parliament. It is difficult to estimate just how much of the current royal family’s wealth is owed to slavery, but it is understood that the profits of the slave trade funded the Treasury, as well as Britain’s industries, buildings, railways, roads and parks. According to Prof Corinne Fowler, an academic at the University of Leicester who specialises in Britain’s colonial legacies, the royal family “has an opportunity to show leadership by acknowledging its involvement, making a formal apology and asking openly and humbly what the family can do to begin to repair the damage”, and a first step to moving on “might be to decide that the Queen should no longer be ceremonial head of state”.",News/UK news,What are the British monarchy’s historical links to slavery?,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/british-royal-family-monarchy-historical-links-to-slavery
3/24/2022,"There have been plenty of bad years for the economy in the recent past and 2022 is shaping up to one of the worst of them. Energy bills are soaring. Taxes are going up. Inflation has returned with a vengeance. Living standards are set for their biggest fall since modern records began in the 1950s. Faced with this cocktail of misfortune, it was always the height of optimism for Rishi Sunak to imagine he could stick to his plan of delivering a short, policy-light update on the state of the economy in a spring statement. So it has proved. Britain’s cost of living crisis – amplified by the impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine – meant the spring statement would morph into what has become the chancellor’s speciality in his two and a bit years in the job, a mini-budget. Tory backbenchers cheered lustily when Sunak pulled his rabbit out of the hat – a 1p income tax cut designed to come into force in April 2024, a month before the date being pencilled in for the next general election. But budgets – and mini-budgets – that look good on the day often look less good in the weeks that follow. And there is every risk the chancellor’s latest offering will conform to this pattern. For a start, Sunak’s package was a lot more modest than he tried to make it sound. The package of new measures announced will provide a £9bn stimulus to the economy – or about 0.4% of the economy’s annual output. But as Paul Dales of Capital Economics pointed out: that will still leave households facing a £20bn hit to their real disposable incomes from rising food, fuel and utilities prices over the next couple of years. Living standards, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), are still going to be cut by more than 2% this year. For the most vulnerable – those not working and reliant on state benefits – the squeeze will be even more severe. That’s because they won’t benefit from the £3,000 increase to the threshold for national insurance contributions – a move that mainly helps better off households – but will be clobbered by rising inflation. Pensions, universal credit and other benefits are going up by 3.1% in April, a month when the annual inflation rate is likely to climb above 8%. The OBR thinks inflation is on course to reach a 40-year-high of almost 9% this year, something that will also put the squeeze on the resources available to Whitehall spending departments. Nor do the chancellor’s credentials as a tax-cutting chancellor really stand up to scrutiny. While Sunak would like to be seen as the son of Margaret Thatcher, the net tax cuts announced in the spring statement offset about a sixth of the tax rises introduced since he became chancellor in February 2020. The tax takeaways announced last year – including the freezing of income tax personal allowances and the new health and social care levy – are worth almost four times as much as the giveaways just announced. Sunak has been firefighting ever since he became chancellor. There was a time last autumn, when the end of the furlough scheme went more smoothly than expected, when he could envisage an end to permanent crisis management, but Ukraine means that is no longer feasible, in the short-term at least. The year ahead will be brutal for millions of people. Growth will slow and inflationary pressure will be strong. Sunak is going to come under pressure to use the money he is squirrelling away from pre-election sweeteners to help households and small businesses this year. This mini-budget is unlikely to be the last.",News/UK news,Spring statement 2022: Sunak leaves the most vulnerable to feel the squeeze | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/23/spring-statement-2022-sunak-analysis-disposable-incomes
3/24/2022,"Owen Farrell is primed to make his rugby return on Saturday for Saracens after a four-month absence. The England captain missed the entire Six Nations campaign following surgery on his right ankle but has spent the last two weeks training with his teammates. Barring another “freak injury” – as the England head coach, Eddie Jones, labelled the last one – Farrell should be in contention for his first game since November. “We will assess him tomorrow and Friday and make sure everything is OK,” the Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, said. “Fingers crossed he will be able to take part in the game. “He is obviously a great player, everyone knows that. For him personally it is great as well, he loves playing rugby and he has not played much. If he does play he is certainly looking forward to it and we are chuffed to have him back.” Saracens play Bristol at Tottenham Stadium as they look to close the 12-point gap between themselves and Leicester at the top of the Premiership table. More than 40,000 tickets have already been sold, according to the club’s press officer. Those in attendance will likely see a formidable Saracens team as McCall said that all of his England returnees are available for selection as well. One of them is the hooker Jamie George, who will play his 250th game for the club. Another is the 23-year-old lock Nick Isiekwe, who resurrected his international career in the Six Nations this year after a four-year hiatus. “Nick got capped early, maybe on reflection a bit too early, and had a couple of difficult experiences, especially away in South Africa when he played there,” McCall said, referencing England’s 42-39 defeat in Johannesburg in 2018. “He’s 23 now and much more ready for it. He is on top of his game, a lot more mature and confident in himself.” McCall spoke glowingly of his England stars despite their struggles during a disappointing tournament under Jones: “Historically our players have been superb at coming back. We are also conscious of the fact, especially in the last two games they have played in, they would have taken some kind of emotional toll. “Going down to 14 men against Ireland and playing the way they did and the occasion they were part of on Saturday [in a 25-13 defeat in Paris], we are very conscious they are human beings and not robots and not to expect them to jump from international rugby straight into club rugby.” Farrell, though, is one of the few England players whose stock has soared these past two months and he will be itching to reestablish himself as the linchpin for club or country. McCall has no doubt that he will. “It’s easy to look back on history and that tells us normally [he fits in] pretty quickly, to be honest,” McCall said. “He’s got the potential to hit the ground running, that’s for sure. I think we all have to be patient and be aware his best rugby probably won’t be this Saturday, but will be in the weeks to come.”",Sport/Sport,Owen Farrell set to return from injury for Saracens after four months out ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/23/owen-farrell-set-to-return-from-injury-for-saracens-after-four-months-out
3/24/2022,"Throughout the chaotic month of January, Ash Barty burst into the new tennis season in full flow, dismantling all challengers. She scythed them with her backhand slice, out-served opponents who towered over her by half a foot or more, and continually displayed her encyclopaedic knowledge of each opponent’s game, honing in on their weaknesses and methodically picking them apart. In a sport where players tend to focus only on themselves, that last quality is distinct enough. But it is even more fascinating considering Barty’s relationship with tennis. Despite the game flowing through her veins, it is not of particular interest aside from her personal ambitions and daily work. Off the court she keeps a healthy distance from it, her hobbies are elsewhere, and tennis is never on the TV when she is nearby. “It’s gonna be a great match,” said Barty, when asked about the second semi-final after she reached the Australian Open final. She chuckled to herself. “I probably won’t watch it.” While Barty’s decision to retire on Wednesday at the age of just 25, as the No 1 player in the world and during such a beautiful moment in her career, is a shock on the surface, the manner of her departure fits perfectly into the way she has conducted her career. Since 2014, when the 18-year-old Barty took an indefinite break from the sport due to burnout and depression, her message has been consistent. She has worked hard, with ambition and drive, but her priorities have remained her family, personal happiness and mental wellbeing. She has always done things her own way. She scheduled tournaments sparingly, always ensuring that she had enough time to return home during the season and to enjoy her various sporting hobbies. When she couldn’t compete without compromising those priorities, as in 2020 when she sat out the second half of the season during Australia’s strictest Covid restrictions, she chose herself. Her careful career management is also what made last year so special. Once Barty left Australia and resumed competition around the world, she could not return until the end of the year. Barty had to fully commit to the chaos that could follow, travelling from tournament to tournament without a proper base and playing more frequently than she ever has. She did. The physical and mental strain was immense, yet those efforts culminated in Barty achieving the ultimate goal of her career at the tournament she impatiently waits for each year: Wimbledon. It makes sense that as she reflected on adding the Australian Open title to her Wimbledon victory of 2021, she came to the conclusion that she had achieved what she had set out to do. Every early retirement in this sport comes with a caveat. Tennis players, particularly in the women’s game, truly love a comeback. The most obvious comparison to Barty’s retirement is Justine Henin’s shock departure in 2008, a player Barty is frequently compared to, and who was also world No 1 when she decided to retire. Henin eventually came back in 2010. The difference between them, though, is that Henin was already burned out by 2008 and it showed in her results. By comparison, Barty is 11-0 in 2022. It is remarkable that she has the self-awareness to assess her situation while standing at the top of the mountain, rather than while beginning to tumble down it. Her message has held out until the end; her tennis career, however successful, joyful and lucrative it has been, should not significantly impact her day-to-day happiness and she has constantly sought perspective in victory and defeat. The possibility of chasing more greatness in tennis is far less important than the contentment she seeks. The career she has built is sublime regardless. Barty has already recorded more weeks at No 1 than all but six women in history, recently passing Henin, with 119 weeks. Only Steffi Graf, Serena Williams, Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert had more consecutive weeks at No 1. Barty’s game itself is peerless; she has the best ever serve for a player of her height, while her backhand slice is one of the great shots of this era. Her forehand, underrated due to the attention on her other talents, dragged opponents off the court with wicked angles and weight. Her talented hands and court sense are paired with incredible athleticism and defence. Her complete game has allowed her to seamlessly adapt to all surfaces and win on all of them. A happy ending for Barty is a difficult loss for her sport. It would have been interesting to see what effect a sustained period of dominance from Barty had on the tour. A true rivalry, something the sport desperately needs, regrettably evaded her. Naomi Osaka should have been her great adversary but the pair somehow managed to completely avoid each other for three years even as they won a combined seven major titles. Just three days ago, meanwhile, it seemed that Iga Swiatek, the new world No 2, was on an unavoidable collision course with Barty. Not anymore. For such an understated personality, the climax that Barty engineered for herself will be hard to forget. Her final match was on Rod Laver Arena in the Australian Open final, the most watched women’s sporting event in the history of her country, and one of the great Australian sporting moments full stop. Her career ended with one last smooth forehand winner, and as the stadium erupted, Barty squeezed her eyes shut and roared into the dark Melbourne sky.",Sport/Sport,Ash Barty built a near-perfect game but never lost sight of the No 1 priority: herself | Tumaini Carayol,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/mar/23/tennis-ash-barty-retires-perfect-game-happiness

Carlo Ancelotti, the Real Madrid manager, said Bale missed the clásico on Sunday because he was unwell but reports in Spain suggested he had a back injury and the Wales captain, while refusing to divulge the reason behind his omission, said he was capable of lasting the distance in Cardiff on Thursday. “I’m in very good shape, a lot better shape than the last camp when I’d been out for about three months,” Bale said. “I’ve been training the last couple of days ready to play whatever is necessary tomorrow and we’ll give it everything we can. For sure it will be one of the biggest games I’ve played in. Qualifying for a World Cup is something I want to achieve, for the fans, for the country.” Bale said Wales had practised penalties in case the game goes beyond extra time and the 32-year-old is determined to help his country to a first World Cup since 1958. He said he had parked thoughts about his own future to focus on the occasion. The forward is out of contract this summer and has previously played down suggestions that this could be his final season. “I haven’t thought about anything other than this game or planned for anything after yet,” he said. “I want to completely focus on this … I’m not thinking about my future as I need to concentrate on now and the future is a distraction.” Bale is poised to face his clubmate David Alaba, who is likely to captain an Austria team ranked 30th in the world. “We know it’s a big game for both countries, so I’ve stayed away from him in training,” Bale joked.

We’ve had friendly banter.” The Spanish daily Marca insinuated Bale made himself unavailable for club duty before joining Wales. Asked to clarify what the Wales interim manager, Robert Page, described as a “niggle”, Bale replied: “No, I don’t need to clarify it because I don’t need to tell anyone what was up.

Don Jr and co-founder Taylor Budowich, a spokesperson for the former president, hope that MxM News (the name refers to “minute by minute”) will compete with giants such as Apple News and Google News, the Axios website reported. They claim that a team of about eight staff will curate stories from across the ideological spectrum (“mainstream news without mainstream bias”). But it remains to be seen if that will include fact-checks of Donald Trump’s “big lie”. The ex-president and his son, who frequently joins him at campaign rallies, have long railed against “fake news” and spoken of a need to challenge big tech companies. Axios quoted Don Jr as saying: “As I travel around the country, the complaint I hear more than almost anything else is that people don’t know what media outlets, journalists or stories they can actually trust. “We created the MxM News app to help people cut through that clutter and get trustworthy news and information about topics that matter and impact their lives.

3/24/2022,"Italy’s former prime minister Giuseppe Conte is under pressure to clarify an arrangement under which Russia supplied aid to Italy early in the coronavirus pandemic, as questions resurface over the Kremlin’s motives. Conte, who was forced to resign last year after the collapse of his second administration, could face questioning by Copasir, a parliamentary committee for the security of Italy, amid concerns that Russia may have exploited the aid mission for espionage. Italy was the first western country to have a major Covid-19 outbreak, and Russia came to its rescue at the height of the emergency, dispatching military doctors, PPE, ventilators and mobile disinfection machines on cargo planes from Moscow. A convoy of lorries emblazoned with the slogan “From Russia with love” was broadcast on Russian state TV making its way to Bergamo, the province most severely affected in the pandemic’s first wave. The mission was set in motion after a phone call between Conte and Vladimir Putin on 21 March 2020 as Italy struggled to get help from EU partners. At the time, Tod Wolters, a Nato general, and several Italian generals expressed concern, chiefly over the presence of Russian military personnel in Italy and a belief that Russia was exploiting the crisis for propaganda with the goal of weakening Europe. The debate has re-emerged in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and after a Russian diplomat, Alexei Paramonov, a former consul in Milan, threatened Italy and other EU states with “irreversible consequences” over sanctions. Paramonov accused the Italian defence minister, Lorenzo Guerini, of being one of the main “hawks of the anti-Russia campaign” despite allegedly having sought Russia’s help in the early days of the pandemic. Riccardo Magi, a deputy with Più Europa, a small leftwing party, said Conte needed to clarify the agreement to Copasir. Magi questioned the Russian aid mission in parliament on 1 April 2020 and received only a partial response seven months later. “Many were annoyed because it was as if I was embarrassing the government by questioning a country that was seen as a friend,” Magi said. “On some points they responded, on other, more significant points they were elusive. This was a deal that was informally brought together with little caution. Maybe nothing [untoward] happened, but we need to know.” Giorgio Gori, the mayor of Bergamo, has also questioned the motives of the Russian operation. Conte said the agreement was “very clear and transparent” and came about in a “moment of extreme difficulty”. La Repubblica reported that a formal request for Conte to be heard would be made at a Copasir meeting on Thursday, particularly to shed light on whether measures were in place to ensure the aid mission did not transform into “a spy mission”.",News/World news,Italian former PM faces renewed questions over Covid aid from Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/italian-former-pm-conte-faces-renewed-questions-over-covid-aid-from-russia
3/24/2022,"Howard Marshall and his partner, Gavin Chuah, have spent three weeks living out of suitcases and bed-hopping in and out of friends’ homes. Flood water inundated the garage of their South Brisbane unit on 27 February, interrupting the building’s electricity and hot water supplies, and shutting off the lift and fire alarm. The pair says they’ve paid $1,500 in rent since then, despite being unable to live in the property, although they have since agreed to a rental pause with the owner. “They said it might be another two to three weeks before the electricity is reconnected … and they reckon it’ll be another three to four months before the lifts are operational,” Marshall says. While most Brisbane residents who lost power had it restored in the week after last month’s flood, some in low-lying areas such as West End and Milton are still in the dark, according to chief executive of Queensland Tenants, Penny Carr. And that can lead to delicate negotiations between tenants and landlords. Carr said her organisation was currently helping a number of flood-affected residents to negotiate rental reductions and changes to lease agreements. While tenants cannot be compensated for damage or loss “that wasn’t anyone’s fault”, such as possessions being destroyed during a flood, Carr says it’s a different story when a property becomes unliveable. “You shouldn’t be asked to pay to rent something that you can’t use partly or completely,” says Carr. But timeliness is a factor. Under Queensland law, if a property becomes uninhabitable as a result of a natural disaster, the tenant or landlord can seek to break the lease within one month of the disaster, which will expire in the next few days. Carr says the law is not “black and white” where liveability is concerned and for the most part, people choose to stay in their tenancy even if they have to leave their homes for a while. “In a situation like this, where the vacancy rates are really low, renters … might be desperate … so it’s not uncommon for the parties to dispute whether a property is liveable, according to the law.” Rent reductions can also occur when there’s a substantial drop in the standard of a property, according to the Residential Tenancies Authority. If tenants and property managers or owners are unable to come to an agreement, they can request free dispute resolution from the RTA. Following that process, if no agreement is reached, they can then apply to the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) for a determination. Carr says QCAT can order an owner or landlord to pay back rent retrospectively but tenants have to keep paying rent until an agreement is reached between the parties. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning For now, Chuah and Marshall have agreed to a rental pause, and the owner, via the building manager has offered for them to break the lease without penalty. However, they are still hoping to obtain a refund of the $1,500 paid despite not living in the unit. The manager said he understood the owner had offered to pause the rent for now and then apply the money paid to rent once the apartment was liveable, although Chuah and Marshall said that had not been communicated to them. The chair of the apartment block’s body corporate committee said residents had been advised not to occupy the units until “electricity and other essential services have been restored”, but he does not know when that will be. “People should not be living in their units and doing so [is] contrary to our advice and at their own risk.” For Marshall and Chuah, a good night’s sleep in their own bed is what they’re looking forward to most. “We’re not sleeping well. We’re sleeping in different beds all the time and we’re stressed, worrying about where we’re going to stay,” says Chuah. “We keep waiting for the power to be restored but don’t know what’s going to happen.”",News/Australia news,Flood-hit Queensland renters have just days left to negotiate a break in their lease,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/flood-hit-queensland-renters-have-just-days-left-to-negotiate-a-break-in-their-lease
3/24/2022,"A UN mission under way in Queensland to see if the Great Barrier Reef should be put on an “in danger” list will not get “the whole picture” unless it visits reefs currently experiencing coral bleaching, conservationists and the government’s own reef envoy have said. Details of the 10-day mission, which began on Monday in Brisbane, are being kept confidential and the locations to be visited have not been formally disclosed. But Guardian Australia understands briefings started in Brisbane, and visits to Lady Elliot Island on the reef’s southern tip, as well as time in Cairns and Townsville, are on the agenda. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) is due to complete aerial bleaching surveys across the 2300-kilometre reef before the end of this week. The authority’s chief scientist, Dr David Wachenfeld, has confirmed bleaching is widespread but variable, saying the flights will give a clearer picture of how the event compares with five previous mass bleachings. Fierce lobbying from the Morrison government last year saw the 21-country World Heritage committee ignore a Unesco recommendation that the reef be placed on a list of sites “in danger”, mainly because of impacts from the climate crisis. Instead, the committee asked Australia to renew its cornerstone Reef 2050 policy so that it “addresses the threat posed to the property by climate change” and said it was concerned progress in cutting pollution running off farms and grazing areas was too slow. Australia requested the mission be carried out and the government’s reef envoy, MP Warren Entsch, said it should visit reefs currently bleaching. “They couldn’t see the whole picture unless they did,” he said. “There should be no whitewashing. They have to see the good and the bad.” Entsch, whose Leichhardt electorate centres on the reef tourism hotspot of Cairns, said he would meet with the mission. “I’ve heard reports of significant bleaching [on some reefs] but also of no bleaching whatsoever. We have to acknowledge the vast area totally unimpacted by this and areas where we have seen magnificent growth [in corals].” Entsch said the mission would be briefed by scientists from the Australian Institute of Marine Science, as well as reef managers at the marine park authority, traditional owner groups and tourism operators. “They will talk to top scientists who have to make the decisions that we base our funding on,” he said. The aerial surveys will confirm if multiple reefs have bleached in at least two of the park’s four management areas, which Wachenfeld said would constitute a “mass bleaching” event. Over a 250km stretch in the reef’s central region, north and south of Townsville, most reefs have bleached severely – where at least 60% of corals on a reef turn white – Wachenfeld said last week. Some corals had already died. Widespread mass bleaching of corals was first seen in 1998, and happened again in 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020. One study has said 98% of the 3,000 individual reefs that make up the entire system have been hit at least once by bleaching. The reef has never seen widespread bleaching in a La Niña year before – the phase of a cycle of ocean temperatures in the Pacific that should keep the region cool enough for corals to escape bleaching. Unesco and the Morrison government have kept details about the mission under wraps. It is being carried out by one scientist from Unesco and another from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Guardian Australia has confirmed the first formal briefings took place on Monday and Tuesday inside the Queensland government’s offices in Brisbane. On Tuesday, Greenpeace staged a protest outside. Representatives were briefed from four reef advisory groups that include scientific experts, community and industry stakeholders, tourism operators and traditional owners. A spokesperson for the Queensland Resources Council – the mining industry’s main lobby – confirmed its chief executive and former Liberal National resources minister, Ian Macfarlane, had been part of those private briefings. The head of oceans at WWF Australia, Richard Leck, was also in the briefing, but said government officials had said Unesco requested “details of the mission be kept confidential”. Leck said he didn’t know if the mission would visit any bleached reefs, but that it was crucial it did. “The fact there’s a bleaching event at the same time as the mission is here means it’s of utmost importance that Unesco witnesses the damage that climate change is causing right now on the Great Barrier Reef,” Leck said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Greenpeace Australia Pacific said it has been asking the government since December for a slot to meet the mission, but climate campaigner Martin Zavan said the group had been “dismissed or ignored”. “We’re important stakeholders,” Zavan said. “It’s very important the mission gets to see what’s happening on the reef, with bleaching now in a La Niña year.” The custodian of Lady Elliot Island and manager of the resort on the island, Peter Gash, said mission scientists would have an overnight stay, tour the island’s major reforestation project and see corals. He said there had been “virtually no bleaching” on the island’s reefs this year. A major long-term project to replant almost all the island’s trees cleared by guano miners in the 19th century had seen major improvements to the health of the corals that fringe the shore. A Unesco spokesperson declined to give any further details on the mission, or say if it would visit bleached reefs.",News/Environment,"UN mission must see coral bleaching to get ‘whole picture’ of Great Barrier Reef, experts say",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/24/un-mission-must-see-coral-bleaching-to-get-whole-picture-of-great-barrier-reef-experts-say
3/24/2022,"Victoria’s Yoorrook Justice Commission will launch on Thursday – marking Australia’s first formal truth-telling process for injustices experienced by First Nations people. Its commencement comes after decades of calls – including in the Uluru Statement of the Heart – for Australia to commit to a formal truth-telling process. It will investigate past and ongoing systemic injustices experienced by Victoria’s First Nations people in the state from colonisation to the present day. The formal launch will be held at the Stolen Generations Marker in Fitzroy – a permanent tribute to Indigenous children forcibly removed from their families – in recognition of the types of wrongdoings Yoorrook will place under its microscope. The commission is named after “Yoo-rrook”, which means “truth” in the Wemba-Wemba/Wamba Wamba language spoken around north-western Victoria. Yoorrook is independent from the Victorian government and the First Peoples’ Assembly – the body elected by the state’s Indigenous people to help develop a treaty. What will the commission do? The commission has a mandate to investigative and document past and present injustices against Victoria’s First Nations people, including by the state and non-government bodies. It’s wide-ranging scope means it will probe historical massacres, genocide and cultural violations as well as ongoing injustices in healthcare, policing, criminal justice and child protection. Its investigations will help determine both the cause and consequences of the systemic injustices. The commission will hold state-wide hearings, including public panels and group and private sessions. Beyond hearings, it will also accept artwork, artefacts, audio, written and oral submissions. The truth-telling process aims to educate Victorians and the wider public about the social, political and economic injustices committed against the state’s Indigenous population since colonisation, the impacts of intergenerational trauma and how this relates to the inequalities which persist today. While separate to the state’s treaty process, the commission’s findings and recommendations may be referred to the First Peoples’ Assembly, which is developing the agreement’s framework. At the conclusion of its hearings, it will make recommendations to the state government for redress and reform. In doing so, the commission hopes its work can help prevent the recurrence of injustices against Indigenous people. Who is on the commission? Five commissioners are leading Victoria’s Yoorrook Justice Commission: Prof Eleanor Bourke – Chair Sue-Anne Hunter – Deputy Chair Senior Elder Dr Wayne Atkinson Kevin Bell QC, Distinguished Prof Maggie Walter. The commissioners were chosen following an open selection process that began after the announcement of the commission in March 2021. There are also two senior counsels-assisting the commission: Tony McAvoy SC – a Wirdi man appointed the first Australian First Peoples Senior Counsel in 2015 Fiona McLeod SC – a human rights barrister. What powers does the commission have? The commission has the same powers of a royal commission, allowing it to subpoena documents and summon witnesses. The commission does not exercise judicial power, but it can refer information about alleged crimes to law enforcement authorities. Why is a commission needed? The commissioners believe the inquiry is an opportunity for Victorians to consider how truth-telling forms an integral part of the healing and unifying process. The inquiry is centred on the presumption that to move forward Victoria must first face past and ongoing wrongdoings, and understand how they have shaped the state. Bourke, the chair of the commission, said the inquiry would correct the public record about Terra Nullius – the legal concept meaning land belonging to no one used by the British to justify the colonisation of Australia. “This was not an empty land and the Mabo decision finally found that,” she said. Hunter, deputy chair of the commission, said the healing process would involve “the coming together of both histories” and allow Indigenous people to be “truly heard”. “The history of Victoria has been told by the side of the oppressor. And when you only have one side of the story, it’s always an imbalance,” she said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “When you’re not heard you become depressed – and I feel like telling the truth is a form of healing and it will be evidence and it won’t be cross-examined.” Victoria’s Aboriginal affairs minister, Gabrielle Williams, said only when Victoria had reconciled with its path could it achieve a “fairer, more just future” for its First Nations community. “Without truth, there can be no treaty, and without treaty, there can be no justice,” she said. What happens after the launch? The commission will lead a yarning circle with Elders on Country in regional Victoria from 28 March until 22 April to ensure their insights feed directly into the investigative process to consider what issues are most important for the inquiry to focus on. Commissioners will also visit sites of cultural and historical significance. From 26 April, elders’ truth-telling will begin – marking the first formal hearings of the process. Hunter said some of the inquiry’s work would take place near the NSW-Victorian border. “If that’s where the truth takes us of what’s happened to our people, that’s where we’ll go,” she said. An interim report is due on 30 June. The commission’s final report is due in June 2024.",News/Australia news,Yoorrook Justice Commission: how will truth-telling process work and what will it achieve?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/yoorrook-justice-commission-how-will-truth-telling-process-work-and-what-will-it-achieve
3/24/2022,"They’re the “problematic” videos that the finance department didn’t want to see the light of day. Created for an “objective” infrastructure campaign, the videos featured a cheery Michael McCormack spruiking federal government spending. They were to be played before free movies in a taxpayer-funded roadshow through regional cities to promote the Building our Future package in 2019, ahead of the May election. Just 137 people attended the six movie nights, including one lone viewer in Ballarat, at a cost to taxpayers of $353,730 – or about $2,500 a ticket. The movie-goers did not get to see the videos of the then-deputy prime minister wishing them a “fantastic evening”. That’s because McCormack’s message was scrapped after the finance department advised that his inclusion in the campaign “does raise some concerns”. First revealed in an Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) report on government advertising in February, Guardian Australia has obtained scripts and video of McCormack’s movie night introductions. In them, the then-infrastructure minister boasts about projects including the Ballarat rail line upgrade, the Toowomba second range crossing and upgrades to the Pacific Highway (M1). The videos reveal McCormack frequently veered off script, adding folksy comments including explaining to the Ballarat audience that the upgrade “to connect communities – that’s you – [will] provide a faster trip in to Melbourne”. In several, McCormack adds a direction to “travel home safe” and explains that the 10-year $75bn investment was worth “75 thousand million”. In one, he adds that this is a “record amount of money”. Movie-goers were encouraged to visit an information stand at the event or the buildingourfuture.gov.au website, “or perhaps do both” to learn more. “I hope you all have a great night and enjoy the movie,” McCormack said. According to the ANAO: “The minister and staff in the minister’s office were involved in determining the final list of activities to be undertaken.” The infrastructure department’s “list of activities did not include the movie roadshow” but it was included “after consulting with the minister’s office”, it said. McCormack told Guardian Australia if “bureaucrats” canned the videos then “so be it” but there was “nothing untoward” and “nothing unusual” about his participation in them. He said he “did what was asked” – at first attributing that request to his department – but then accepting that staff in his office “may well have” suggested the videos. McCormack said the roadshows “were a good thing” that countered the problem that “all too often” locals were not informed about investments and opportunities created by government. “It would’ve taken me, seriously, 10 minutes … It wouldn’t have been onerous, it wouldn’t have been expensive.” Correspondence obtained under freedom of information reveals the infrastructure department sought approval on 19 March 2019, just two days before the first roadshow event. In that email, an infrastructure official said finance “were consulted in the drafting of the introduction and the script reflects advice that it should be non-political and only make reference to the government”. But in reply, the communications branch of the finance department said “in its entirety” the proposal “does raise some concerns”. “The placement of a message from the deputy prime minister within a paid campaign cinema event is problematic in respect to complying with the intent of the guidelines.” It cited both the principle that “campaigns should be objective and not directed at promoting party political interests” and infrastructure’s commitment that “public relations, social media and below-the-line activities undertaken for the campaign will not be instigated by any political party or politician, or make reference to any political party of politician”. “As a result finance cannot support the event going forward in its current form,” it said. The finance department also questioned the “net benefit for the campaign when factoring in potential criticism of the approach”. On 20 March 2019 the finance department added that it had not been consulted about the scripts for McCormack’s messages. The ANAO noted McCormack and “other Coalition MPs and senators attended movie roadshow events”, which finance advised was “relatively common”. The events went ahead between 21 and 30 March 2019 without the McCormack message, drawing 65 people in Coolangatta, 20 in Toowoomba, 18 in Ballina and 30 in Mt Annan. The event in Ballarat on 29 March attracted just one attendee, while Torquay’s movie night on 30 March had three attendees and was “cancelled due to adverse weather”, according to the ANAO. The infrastructure department said it had agreed with all ANAO recommendations, including to “assess whether continuing a campaign represents proper use of taxpayer resources”. It said it was committed to “continuous improvement” and the ANAO had found a later stage of the campaign “[indicated] improvements in campaign administration”.",News/Australia news,"Michael McCormack’s movie nights cost taxpayers $2,500 a ticket – and his scene was cut",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/michael-mccormacks-movie-nights-cost-taxpayers-2500-a-ticket-and-his-scene-was-cut
3/24/2022,"Victorian alleged sexual assault victims will have the right to defend their confidential communications being aired in court under new amendments to be introduced to state parliament by Justice Party MP Stuart Grimley. The amendments to the Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 2022, to be debated in the upper house on Thursday, were recommended in two separate inquiries by the Victorian Law Reform Commission in 2016 and 2021. Grimley, a former police officer, said confidential communications – such as discussions with a medical practitioner or counsellor – are often obtained by defence lawyers to undermine a victim’s credibility, including by showing a history of mental health issues as a basis as to why they have made a complaint. He said victims can often feel embarrassed, re-traumatised and betrayed by the legal system when their personal information, including disclosures that may not be relevant to the case, are heard before a courtroom or are used in cross-examination. “These amendments will make it non-negotiable for a victim to be notified for applications to access or use their confidential communications,” Grimley said. “They will further allow for the victim to tell the court about why that access or use would be harmful to them. “It is a disgrace that this was recommended six years ago by the VLRC and victims are still waiting. It shouldn’t be delayed any further and that is why I have introduced the changes as an amendment to a government bill.” Under the Evidence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, police are required to notify a victim of an application to access their confidential communications. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning But the VLRC’s 2016 inquiry into the role of victims of crime in the criminal trial process, and the 2021 inquiry into improving the way the justice system responds to sexual offences, were told by victims, support groups and Victoria Police that this was not occurring regularly. In its submission to the 2016 inquiry, Victoria Police said “there is no obligation to serve the notice on the victim or for the victim to be informed that the application is being made”. No victim consulted by the commission was aware of their entitlement. A woman named Tabitha, told the 2021 inquiry her mental health history was subpoenaed and “used against [her]”. “I had disclosed a previous sexual assault to my psychologist for the first time just two days before the assault which was the subject of the trial,” Tabitha told the inquiry. “The defence lawyer kept questioning me about this as if it was no coincidence but rather, an attempt to get more attention/sympathy. It felt like I was going through the assault all over again, but this time I was being mocked. “There was no one standing up for me and asking about the relevance of my mental health history. Surely, given the prevalence of mental health issues in our society, many people with these issues are assaulted … I felt like I was the criminal and I was the one on trial.”  In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14.

3/24/2022,"The Morrison government has allocated $5.9bn to build two separate north Queensland dams without seeking any input from an advisory board it established less than two years ago to scrutinise major water projects. Commitments to fund the Hells Gates and the Urannah dams – proposals pitched at voters in bellwether Queensland electorates – have been made in the past week. However serious questions have been raised about the economic benefits of the Urannah project and the detailed business case for the Hells Gates project is still under development. “We’ve done the homework on Hells Gates Dam and it’s now time to get on and build it,” the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said on Wednesday. But Guardian Australia has confirmed that neither dam proposal was subjected to any formal scrutiny from the National Water Grid Advisory Board – a body established in 2020 to provide “expert advice” to the government on water infrastructure projects. The Guardian understands the advisory board would typically scrutinise a dam proposal by looking at a detailed business case prepared by the proponent. It would then provide feedback to government. In the case of Urannah, the proponent, Bowen River Utilities, says it has recently completed its detailed business case for the project, located about 90km west of Mackay. It is understood this has not yet been seen by members of the water grid advisory board. Guardian Australia reported in 2020 that an economic analysis, commissioned by local environmental groups, found the Urannah project could return as little as 26c for every dollar invested. A detailed business case for the Hells Gates Dam, north-west of Townsville, is still in development. Townsville Enterprise, the proponent, says on its website that the document will be ready in April. In his press release on Wednesday, Morrison said the funding for Hells Gates was contingent on the detailed business case, and that the document would not be ready until June. A federal election will be held before the end of May. Kennedy MP Bob Katter said the North Queensland Water Infrastructure Authority also apparently “knew nothing about” the details of the government’s announcement. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Katter has long supported a different version of the Hells Gates proposal – one that would send water to the west for irrigation. He said the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, had previously backed such a plan, which would require the dam be built at a greater height. “They are proceeding with a tiny dam scheme and are sending no water west at all,” Katter said. When making his announcement on Wednesday, Morrison immediately sought to pressure the state government on approvals for the 2,100-gigalitre Hells Gates dam, which would be about four times the size of Sydney Harbour. The proponent has not begun an environmental impact assessment, which would need to be completed and then submitted for assessment. The process could take years. “You know, this is not been plucked out of the air, in any stretch,” Morrison told reporters on Wednesday. “This has been a four-year process to get to this point to know this is the right dam, to be built in the right way. As soon as we can get the state government to approve building this dam, then we can get under way and so that is the next key step. “I don’t think there’s a case against this dam. I think there’s only a case for this dam. The only thing that would stop it, I think, is if the Greens get in the ear of either the federal Labor party, which we have seen them do that before, or they get in the ear of the state Labor government. “But as far as the LNP is concerned here in Queensland, we’re all for building this dam and many more.”",News/Australia news,Morrison government committed $5.9bn for dams without advice from water infrastructure board,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/morrison-government-committed-59bn-for-dams-without-advice-from-water-infrastructure-board
3/24/2022,"“Music,” wrote the late neurologist Oliver Sacks, “has a unique power to express inner states or feelings. Music can pierce the heart directly; it needs no mediation.” A new analysis has empirically confirmed something that rings true for many music lovers – that singing, playing or listening to music can improve wellbeing and quality of life. A review of 26 studies conducted across several countries including Australia, the UK and the US has found that music may provide a clinically significant boost to mental health. Seven of the studies involved music therapy, 10 looked at the effect of listening to music, eight examined singing and one studied the effect of gospel music. The analysis, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Network Open, confirmed “music interventions are linked to meaningful improvements in wellbeing”, as measured quantitatively via standardised quality-of-life survey data. The effects were similar whether participants sang, played or listened to music. The authors of the meta-analysis suggest that the benefit of music to mental quality of life was close in effect to improvements in mental health due to exercise and weight loss. “Future research is needed to clarify optimal music interventions and doses for use in specific clinical and public health scenarios,” the authors said, emphasising that there was “substantial individual variation in responses to music interventions” across the studies analysed. “Many of us know from personal experience how profound a music intervention can be at times that include surgery, ill-health or mental health episodes,” said Kim Cunio, an associate professor and convener of musicology at the Australian National University, who was not involved in the research. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This study makes the connection between our personal experiences and a growing body of data of peer-reviewed research that makes the case for music as a frontline intervention in our health system. “All of us are experts in music because we’ve spent thousands of hours listening to music, codifying it in our brain and responding to it. Is it any wonder what when we listen to music, something remarkable happens? “When I’m feeling that things are a little bit hard, I turn to music like we all do. Sometimes that music is a deliberate echo of how I’m feeling … sombre and sad. But sometimes I need music of a completely different feeling that can snap me out of that space. “This is the true wonder of music – that there is no rule as to what is best to listen to.

3/24/2022,"Politicians routinely dismiss allegations of bullying made by women by painting it as just the “cost of doing politics” or as something that happens to men just as much, new research has found. University of Adelaide psychologists found female Liberal MPs were undermined, silenced and discredited by the way those in their own party treated their accusations. The peer-reviewed study was published on Thursday in the Australian Journal of Social Issues. The academics chose a specific period in 2018 when four female Liberal MPs had complained of bullying and interrogation. In the paper they acknowledged that since gathering the data for the study there had been more incidents that fed into the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, including former staffer Brittany Higgins’ allegation. The paper was published as Labor continued to battle allegations the late senator Kimberley Kitching was bullied by senior party figures. Researchers looked at the responses from men and women to: Former Liberal MP Julia Banks, who quit after citing “cultural and gender bias, bullying and intimidation” from both her own party and the opposition. Former foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop, who said she had witnessed behaviour in parliament that “wouldn’t be tolerated in any other workplace across Australia”. Government services minister, Linda Reynolds, who said there was “bullying and intimidation” in the lead-up to the spill that saw Malcolm Turnbull replaced by Scott Morrison as prime minister. Former Liberal senator Lucy Gichuhi, who said she would name and shame bullies in the party (she later backed down on that threat). They picked 601 transcripts over six weeks, then narrowed them down to 46 interviews that were specifically about those accusations of bad behaviour, then used coding to pull out the “discursive repertoires”. These were the recurrent words and phrases used to frame the discussion. The research found Liberal politicians “routinely mobilised” two ideas – that bullying applied equally to men and women, and that “politics is tough”, which together “served to downplay and legitimise bullying and intimidation as normative and unproblematic”. Politicians including the prime minister, Scott Morrison, used alternative descriptions to bullying, talking about the pressure women were under or using the phrase “robust discussion”. Talking about the ballot process that delivered him the leadership, Morrison said: “Both men and women are subject to a lot of pressure when they are making these decisions.” The authors wrote that women were often reluctant to report abuse, bullying or intimidation because of shame, fear of retaliation, or the desire to avoid being seen as a “victim”. When they did speak out, they risked being seen as unsuited to the rough and tumble of politics when it was framed that way. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Those who responded to allegations of abuse or bullying then often didn’t recognise it as a problem, considering it “the cost of doing politics”. “In politics, these actions serve to constrain women’s contributions by systematically undermining, silencing and discrediting them,” the authors wrote. They said there was “growing literature on violence against women in politics” and they wanted to understand how politicians responded to allegations of violence. That violence includes threats, intimidation, injury, rape, sexual harassment, economic controls, and sexist language and behaviour. Parliament is a male-dominated space, they wrote: “The bullying and intimidation experienced by women may continue to be the cost of their political engagement unless systemic change occurs that acknowledges the ongoing relevance of gender in politics. “Understanding how politicians routinely make sense of gender discrimination in the workplace is important, given the increased number of women entering politics and the increased reporting of sexism, harassment and sexual assault in recent years.” They also made the point that having a growing number of women in politics was not proof that gender equality had been reached.",News/Australia news,"Bullying claims by female Liberal MPs routinely dismissed by colleagues, new research finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/24/bullying-claims-by-female-liberal-mps-routinely-dismissed-by-colleagues-new-research-finds
3/24/2022,"Welcome to Poland. It’s a phrase hundreds and thousands of Ukrainians are hearing each week as they flee their war-torn homeland in search of safety – and sometimes it’s said in an Australian accent. Russia’s invasion has sparked one of the biggest refugee crises since the second world war. In just two weeks, more than 3 million people have fled the country, with more than a million crossing one of eight border checkpoints into Poland. There, the UN, the Red Cross and NGOs are being assisted by an army of volunteers – regular citizens from across Europe and beyond – who have come to help. In the chaos of Przemyśl station or at one of the makeshift reception centres in Warsaw, languages from across the continent are spoken. In English, some of the accents are Australian. The Ukrainian diaspora in Australia is small – the last census recorded 13,000. But they are tight-knit and passionate about their homeland. Some have headed overseas to help. Stefan Romaniw, who co-chairs the Australian Federation of Ukrainian Organisations, has just spent a week travelling between Poland and parts of western Ukraine. He met with Ukraine’s foreign affairs minister, Dmytro Kuleba, and the mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi. Romaniw was there to get an understanding of what was needed on the ground so Ukrainians across the globe can coordinate their aid response. “We spent some time on the border on both sides – if you can imagine thousands of people with a handbag or suitcase, or young children with one toy in their hand, being marched through an area to be processed,” he said. “Big shopping centres, full of stretchers, 1,000 to 2,000 people sleeping there with nothing more than what they brought. There are field kitchens, medical facilities, play centres for children. The infrastructure is very good.” Romaniw said the Polish government was doing an “extraordinary job” handling the crisis but the grief of those pouring over the border was immense. “When you speak to people there are different reactions. For some it’s shock, for young children, they’re tired, they’re dragging their feet. For those who are older, you can see the despair. “You ask yourself how it could happen in 2022.” Romaniw wants the Australian government to provide more help – including humanitarian and military aid. He said the situation on the ground is terrifying and “there is no place safe in Ukraine anymore”.

She heard families were struggling to get the right help in Germany and, given she speaks English, German and Ukrainian, she booked a plane ticket to help. “It came to my attention that some families, mainly women with children, that made it to Germany, they’ve found it difficult,” she said. “I hope using my contacts and language I can make a difference.” On 4 March, the European Union announced Ukrainians would be permitted to live, work, and study in EU member states for up to three years. Nikitina said the language barrier had made it difficult for some Ukrainians to access services so she has been contacting government organisations on their behalf. “There are language barriers; the German government, they don’t want to register them with [the] special Ukrainian status, they’re trying to register them as refugees. So [they] have no right to work, [they’re] not able to leave the capital,” she said. People she has met just want to put their kids in school and get some form of income before they can go back to their own country. “They’re not friends, they’re not family [but] they’re still Ukrainian. It’s about trying to help.” Not every Australian helping has a strong Ukrainian connection. Isabelle Robertson, an expat who lives in Salzburg has set up “Free Rides West” with a group of friends. They’ve been driving six vans over to Poland, dropping off supplies and picking up people who need lifts back to western Europe. “We are just a group of friends offering lifts to those who need it,” Robertson said. “We saw an opportunity to help.” Robertson said in places the infrastructure was straining to keep up. She said one reception centre was so full they were having to choose who got to stay inside and who was left to fend in Poland’s harsh winter. “The people not in priority groups are being pushed out. It’s freezing cold and people are only carrying what they can,” she said. A family of four elderly relatives, one in a wheelchair, had been struggling to find help before one of the vans picked them up. “No one wanted to take them. Transporting someone with a disability, there are more logistics, it’s so horrible, they’re put in a position to prioritise human beings.” The group has transported 92 people from the Polish border to countries across Europe – organising plane tickets for them if it is too far to drive. Every story is different. “We had dinner the other night with professors from Ukraine, deans from universities and their kids. Another mum spent 5 days in a bunker with a 6-year-old and a 2-year-old and would have to go out for supplies, not knowing if she would come back. “Another family from Odessa were in good spirits, we talked work, soccer, and how beautiful Odessa is, we turned on the news, Odessa was preparing to be shelled.” The vans have picked up a 19-year-old girl separated from her parents, a 15-year-old boy who was just young enough to leave who was travelling with his mother, a grandmother and five kids going to Bologna. The group has translators on the phone ready to answer any questions. “We can only help a handful. The reality is when there are over 3 million [people] this is a small drop,” Robertson said.",News/World news,‘I can make a difference’: how Australian volunteers are helping Ukrainian refugees across Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/24/i-can-make-a-difference-how-australian-volunteers-are-helping-ukrainian-refugees-across-europe
3/24/2022,"Easter Monday will mark seven weeks since floods swept through much of the NSW’s northern rivers region. The question for thousands of potential holidaymakers to Byron Bay and beyond is now pressing: To go or not to go? Floods are a fickle disaster, meaning some parts of far northern NSW are operating as normal, while others are in ruins. This means potential visitors must think carefully about where exactly they plan to travel. “Byron Bay township itself was, luckily, very minimally affected and the majority of businesses in town are open as usual,” says Mick Webb, manager of Byron Bay’s Visitor Centre. “Yet, having been on the ground in Lismore and Mullumbimby, I feel people really need to understand the severity of the loss, destruction and burden that so many are dealing with. It’s actually hard to articulate how devastating this situation is.” Peter Noble, executive chairman of Bluesfest Group, the region’s major annual Easter music festival, agrees. “It’s the worst thing that’s happened in our community ever,” he says. “The word ‘apocalyptic’ comes to mind. It’s heartbreaking to see.” After cancellations in 2020 and 2021 due to Covid-19, Bluesfest is set to go ahead over Easter, despite some minor flooding. “Bluesfest will be happening pretty much as a normal event,” Noble says. “If you look hard enough you’ll see where the water went but we’ve almost dried out.” Given the scope of the devastation elsewhere, he added, “I don’t really want to talk about that small degree of loss.” “We don’t want to have a depression out of this,” Noble says. “Bluesfest employs 1,000 people, 80-90% who are locals, including some who have lost their homes.” Many other tourism ventures have also been able to move from clean-up processes to community crisis relief, and are now returning to business. After evacuating her own horses to safety, Kate Noller, owner of Byron-based riding school Zephyr Horses, says she ‘“spent most of the flood week in boats and choppers delivering bandages, fuel, water and hay to flood-affected horses”. “Business is slowly picking up again now,” she says. “I know people are not coming to Byron because of the floods, but our businesses need visitors.” Housing, already in crisis before the floods, is now a critical issue. Thousands of homes have been declared uninhabitable, with those residents joining thousands more living in temporary accommodation for weeks or months while homes are repaired. Airbnb, a topic of contention in the region, has established a formal program to help accommodate locals, in conjunction with the Australian Red Cross. “We are extremely grateful for the generosity of our host community, who, through this effort … have been offering up their homes to those in need of free, temporary accommodation,” said Susan Wheeldon, Airbnb country manager. There is concern from some areas of the community that locals may lose their temporary accommodation as peak holiday season approaches. Airbnb did not provide Guardian Australia comment on this concern. Localresidents are also being housed in Airbnbs through informal arrangements. A local who manages seven Airbnb properties says they had suggested their clients offer their houses at significantly reduced rates to flood-affected families, which the property owners did. The property manager, who the Guardian has chosen not to name, says the families in the properties they manage will be able to stay during the holidays, and noted that the homes were either already vacant over Easter, or that bookings had been cancelled due to the floods. “Our local families need any homes available and hopefully more people that run Airbnbs will also offer them up for this devastating period,” they said. The Tweed coast escaped the worst of the February flooding – a relief for the community just south of Queensland after two years of border closures. “Hinterland roads are not in great shape but coastal areas are largely OK,” says Bradley Nardi, from the region’s tourism management company. In contrast, John Walker, general manager for Lismore city council has a clear message for would-be visitors. “What little accommodation remains in Lismore is needed for tradespeople who are working on our recovery,” he says. “Due to the extensive damage from the recent flooding disaster, we ask that people love us from afar and not visit Lismore or its villages at this time.” This message is echoed by Alicia Wallace, who leads visitor services at Ballina shire council. “While tour operators are desperate for business, car hire and accommodation are at capacity and we ask people to delay travel to after May.” It has proved hard to forecast the likely availability of car hire in the region. Many rentals are being used by local people who lost vehicles in the floods, and by rescue workers. The Avis Budget Group declined to provide information on the availability of hire cars over the holiday period, but stated that customers could cancel reservations without penalty, “if it is a result of the flood emergency”. Water quality may also be an issue. Ballina shire council’s water monitoring program warned of possible stormwater pollution due to flooding on 21 March, while Byron shire council reported unsafe E coli levels at a popular family beach in Brunswick Heads in mid-March, and a spokesperson stated that flood situations can “change the nature of the water for days and possibly weeks after the event”. Telecommunications outages are also proving a major frustration, resulting from both flood damage as well as an unrelated fire in the Mullumbimby mobile tower. Though the humidity is dropping and there are patches of sunny autumn weather, the Bureau of Meteorology’s forecast for April includes higher than usual rainfall. If there is consensus across the flood-affected areas, it is that visiting at a later stage will be massively helpful for longer-term recovery. “Please come here and support all our local businesses,” says Lismore local Virginia Guyler, whose decision to leave for higher ground the evening before the floods saved her from being in her Lismore home when it was washed off its foundations. “What I would say to people is come, when the time is right.” 1. Don’t assume. The news has painted a realistically grim picture, but there’s huge variation across the northern rivers region. 2. Check. Business websites may not have been updated, so check social media and make direct contact about accommodation, car hire and activities. “Visitor Information Centres are great sources of local truth,” says Bradley Nardi. 3. Now is not the time to wing it. If you haven’t yet booked, be aware that accommodation or car hire may not be easy – or possible – to secure. 4. Manage your expectations. While holidays are a chance to escape from reality, these floods are too big to ignore. It may be odd seeing army trucks in Byron, but that’s life in the area right now. Though it is nice, as a visitor, to have your needs prioritised, be aware this won’t always be possible. 5. Don’t be a flood-tourist. It is natural to want to see the extent of the damage with your own eyes but this affects others’ privacy, your safety and recovery works. “Many of our roads sustained significant damage and are unsafe. Any increase in traffic will only make this worse,” says John Walker, Lismore council’s general manager. 6. Help is not always helpful. Turning up to a flood-affected community in shorts and thongs will not only not cut it, but can be dangerous. The only way to help out on the ground is through pre-planning specifics with individuals or recovery centres, and bringing all your own gear. 7. Help by spending and donating. Whether you go or postpone your visit, spend in person or online to support northern rivers’ businesses. Consider allocating a percentage of your holiday dollars to a flood-recovery fundraising cause.

3/24/2022,"Telstra has defended its response to recent floods in northern New South Wales, saying large-scale and lengthy outages were inevitable once rivers cut off electricity or flooded base stations. Telstra’s chief executive, Andy Penn, said it was understandable for communities to be frustrated about disruption to telecommunications but the damage to infrastructure was significant, and it would take time to rebuild. “MPs will often lash out sort of loosely,” Penn said, adding that Telstra staff had worked closely with emergency services to restore services, even using fishing rods and lines to cast fibre links over rivers to replace cables that had been washed away. “If a tower has been taken out because of a bushfire or because of a flood, there’s nothing that we can do about that in the short term,” he said. Since telecommunications infrastructure is typically near the communities that use it, if the community is affected, so will be the equipment. Catherine Cusack, the NSW upper house MP who said she would resign because the Morrison government had delayed extending flood assistance to areas not in a National MP’s electorate, said Telstra should have done a much better job of keeping the public informed about efforts to restore services. “The communications about communications was a shambles,” Cusack said. “They didn’t come across as caring at all – that just made people more anxious.” Cusack said she emailed Telstra to tell them the poor information being disseminated “has triggered immense anger and eroded our confidence you are working as fast as you can on these problems”. The daily briefings for local MPs by emergency services were often heated in the aftermath of the floods, with communications among the leading issues. One concern was about why the backup battery for one of Telstra’s main bases in the region was located in a basement that was quickly flooded, Cusack said. “We must have had second-class infrastructure for it to give in so easily.” Penn said that in the majority of cases, the main problem was the lack of electricity. While Telstra can provide batteries, the backup is limited and still may be inundated, and it can take time to get staff in to repair equipment if roads are dangerous or blocked because of flooding. Ongoing efforts to restore services may get a fresh set back if expected rains return to flood-hit regions in coming days. The NSW State Emergency Service on Wednesday warned of the potential for flash flooding and riverine flooding in the northern rivers and mid-north coast districts. “The BoM has advised these areas will be impacted by storm activity over coming days with localised heavy falls up to 150mm in some areas with embedded ‘supercells’,” the SES said in the alert. The BoM had issued a flood watch for minor flooding on the Bellinger and Nambucca rivers.

On Wednesday the company announced a technology trial to plant and manage the reforestation of 240 hectares of land to store greenhouse gas emissions and improve environmental resilience of its property. Telstra will plant about 158,000 native trees and shrubs, which are expected to store about 160,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide over the next 25 years, Penn said, adding the gains would amount to about 1% of the carbon it emits. The company will use aerial drones to plant the seeds and use its own Internet of Things capability to monitor environmental conditions and weather predictions. “This trial is really about seeing the role that we can play in creating more carbon credits by taking more carbon out of the environment,” Penn said.

3/24/2022,"The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has called on Japan to increase pressure on Russia by imposing a trade embargo on Russian goods, in a virtual address to MPs in Tokyo. Zelenskiy, who has delivered carefully tailored speeches to lawmakers in the US, UK and other countries, thanked Japan for “leading the way” among Asian countries in condemning Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and imposing sanctions. “Responsible states unite to protect peace. I am grateful to your state for its principled position at such a historic moment, for real assistance to Ukraine,” Zelenskiy said on Wednesday in the first address of its kind to Japanese lawmakers. “You were the first in Asia who really began to put pressure on Russia to restore peace, who supported sanctions against Russia, and I urge you to keep doing this.” In a later address to French MPs he called on French companies including Renault and the supermarket group Auchan to leave Russia. He compared the destruction of Mariupol with “the ruins of Verdun as in the photos of the first world war that everyone has seen”. Zelenskiy claimed in his address to Japanese MPs that Russian forces were preparing to use chemical weapons and launch new attacks from the exclusion zone around the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, which Russian troops occupied last month in the early stages of the invasion. He offered no details, but said four of Ukraine’s nuclear power plants were in a “dangerous” state. The Chernobyl plant suffered a catastrophic accident 25 years before the March 2011 meltdown at Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant in north-east Japan, although Zelenskiy did not mention Fukushima in his address. Japan has joined international sanctions against the Kremlin and offered humanitarian assistance. Its sanctions on 76 individuals, seven banks and 12 other bodies in Russia cover defence officials and the state-owned arms exporter Rosoboronexport. It has also said it will revoke Russia’s trade status of most favoured nation. Japan has also accepted a small number of Ukrainians fleeing the war and voiced a willingness to take more – a gesture that surprised many given its usually strict rules on refugees and asylum seekers. In response, Russia has labelled Japan an “unfriendly” country and this week said it was suspending negotiations over a longstanding territorial dispute that has prevented the two countries from signing a postwar peace treaty. Japan and Russia both lay claim to the Kuril islands – known as the Northern Territories in Japan – which were invaded by Soviet forces towards the end of the second world war. Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, last week said Russia was “illegally occupying” the islands, located near Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido. “We also have to think about Ukraine’s recovery after the war, about the people who have been forced from their homes and their strong desire to return home,” Zelenskiy said. I think the people of Japan understand that feeling.” Zelenskiy had angered some conservative Japanese MPs when he invoked Pearl Harbor in appealing for more help from the US in a recent address to Congress. “Remember Pearl Harbor, terrible morning of 7 December 1941, when your sky was black from the planes attacking you,” Zelensky said last week. “Just remember it, remember, September 11, a terrible day in 2001 when evil tried to turn US cities into battlefields, when innocent people were attacked from air, just like nobody else expected it and you could not stop it. Our country experiences the same, every day, right now at this moment.” On Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader received a standing ovation after his 12-minute address, which he ended by thanking his audience in Japanese.",News/World news,Zelenskiy calls on Japan to impose trade embargo on Russian goods,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/23/zelenskiy-calls-on-japan-to-impose-trade-embargo-on-russian-goods
