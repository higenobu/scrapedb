2/5/2022,"It’s a cold Sunday morning and I’m walking down an alley alongside the Tube tracks, fingers laced round a coffee from the place next to the station. Three quarters of the way down I stop at an anonymous blue door in a brick archway and knock. There is no answer. I push at the door. Nothing happens. One of my favourite parts of being in a band is the rigorously enforced idleness: even if you’re a dawn-greeting, workaholic musician, the guy in charge of unlocking the rehearsal rooms is never going to turn up before 11am. I am permitted to consider myself ambitious for arriving at 10.45.  I’m about to walk back to the studio office when I hear faint muttering from the other side of the door. “Hello?” I say. “Hang on,” says the voice. “What? Oh no.” It turns out the fiddle player is already inside, but he can’t figure out how to work the lock. After two minutes of what sounds like fingernails scraping against wood, the door suddenly opens. “Did you sleep here?” I say. “No, the guy just let me in,” he says. “But he didn’t show me how to get out.” “Is it just us?” I say. “So far,” he says. I think: when did I become such a go-getter? One by one the rest of the band drift in. Our stuff is still set up from the night before, so it’s a simple matter of tuning up and playing in our coats until the room gets warm. We are here to rehearse for the initial leg of our first tour in almost three years: Bury, Newcastle, Settle, Bristol, Exmouth, Dorchester. There is a lot to learn – our new album adds 12 more tunes to a large repertoire of songs I cannot remember how to play. If you include the songs I never knew how to play, it must amount to almost 100. We pick something easy for the first song of the day, although it is not easy for me. “Before we start,” I say. “Can you just remind me how it starts? And also, how it ends?” As the song gets under way, I quickly realise there was something I forgot to ask about: the middle. I lose my way about eight bars in and never recover. I have a recurring nightmare in which I find myself sitting an exam for a course I have never attended. Actually it’s more of a traumatic memory than a nightmare, but it still wakes me up three or four times a year, and this stupid song reminds me of it. When it’s over I don’t look up to see if anyone else is looking at me. “I think we should probably do that again,” say the guitar player. Surprisingly, the second time through the song starts to materialise under my fingers; by the end I feel pretty confident. This happens again and again throughout the morning. After just a few hours my playing has improved to the point where I feel able to laugh at the mistakes of others. There is a knock at the studio door. The fiddle player is closest; once again, he struggles with the interior latch mechanism. When the door opens I see my wife standing on the other side of it. I cannot imagine what she’s doing there, but then I remember: I asked her to come. “Hello!” she says, brightly, as the guitar player’s wife follows her inside. “We’ve come for some music!” She has not come for any music. She has come because I asked her to drop off the car so I could ferry my stuff home that evening. She refused, but since then she’s been for a walk with the guitar player’s wife, which has evidently left her in a generous mood. She sits on a fake leather sofa facing me, arms folded, wearing an expectant expression. We launch into the next song on the list. My face reddens as I stare fixedly at the point where the ceiling meets the wall. I find it much easier to play in front of strangers than I do my wife. I think: I wish I was in Bury. Ten minutes later the tables have turned. My wife’s smile is frozen; she doesn’t how to escape. Fortunately for her, lunch is declared after two songs. She hands me the car keys. “I left it slung across the middle of the alley,” she says. “I hope that’s OK.” “I’ll move it,” I say, following her out. One of my other recurring nightmares involves parking in this very alley, full of tight angles, reversing vans and busy bodywork establishments. But it’s a quiet afternoon, and as I gently scrape the wing mirror along a concrete pillar, I think: this is the least of my problems.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Tim Dowling: we’re rehearsing for our first tour in years.

2/5/2022,"At first glance, the town of Woodside may look more like a sprawl of mansions built on big-tech billions than crucial habitat for threatened California mountain lions. But town officials might suggest looking again.  The wealthy San Francisco Bay area suburb has said it cannot approve the development of new duplexes or fourplexes to ease the statewide housing shortage because it encompasses the habitat of the elusive wildcats. Residents in Woodside had long bristled at SB 9 – a new California measure that makes it easier to build multi-unit housing in neighborhoods previously reserved for single-family homes. But a clause in the measure exempts areas that are considered habitat for protected species. “Given that Woodside – in its entirety” is habitat for mountain lions that environmental groups are petitioning to list as threatened or endangered under the state’s Endangered Species Act, “no parcel within Woodside is currently eligible for an SB 9 project”, the town’s planning director wrote in a memo on 27 January. Critics of the town council, including many housing advocates, have accused the town of cynically using environmental concerns to avoid compliance with state law. “This is nimbyism disguised as environmentalism,” said Scott Wiener, a California senator who co-authored SB 9. “The notion that building duplexes hurts mountain lions – it’s just ridiculous.” Woodside is not only a habitat for mountain lions, but also for notable tech entrepreneurs including the Intuit co-founder Scott Cook and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison. The latter modeled his 23-acre Woodside estate on a 16th-century Japanese imperial palace. The median home price in the town is $5.5m, and the median household income is more than $250,000. The landscape is scattered with sizable mansions and estates as well as sprawling ranches. Mountain lions – also called pumas, cougars and panthers – have been known to wander into suburbs and cities across California, and may occasionally traverse the town. “You can see there’s a fair amount of habitat in the undeveloped areas around the city,” said Winston Vickers, director of the Mountain Lion Project at the UC Davis Wildlife Health Center. “Any development should be done with careful consideration of whether it is going to impact a nearby travel corridor, green belt or large adjacent habitat area for mountain lions,” Vickers said. “But to say that any expansion of housing, anywhere in a given city, would likely impact mountain lions is likely a bit of a stretch.” Woodside’s mayor, Dick Brown, declined an interview request from the Guardian. “We love animals,” he told AlmanacNews. “Every house that’s built is one more acre taken away from [mountain lions’] habitat. Where are they going to go? Pretty soon we’ll have nothing but asphalt and no animals or birds.” As far as wildlife biologists know, mountain lions are not especially comfortable on land zoned for single family homes, nor are they particularly put off by two-story apartment buildings. The biggest challenge that mountain lions are facing is “ex-urban development pushing into the wild areas that they need, and major roadways cutting through those habitats,” said Josh Rosenau, a conservation advocate with the Mountain Lion Foundation, one of the organizations seeking to have the mountain lions in the south and central coast listed as threatened or endangered under the California Endangered Species Act. In most cases, “increasing [housing] density where possible, is going to be better for mountain lions ultimately”, he said, than expanding construction further into wildland areas. As California pushes to expand housing amid a crisis of housing affordability and homelessness, communities across the state have resisted efforts to build more densely, often using the state’s strict environmental laws as a shield. With SB 9 taking effect this year, cities across the state also sought to pass design restrictions, or designate historic districts and sites in a scramble to find loopholes in the law. Earlier last month, Woodside had passed an ordinance prohibiting basements in SB 9 developments, capping their size to 800 square feet – the minimum required by the law – and prohibiting their construction in “very high fire severity zones, for health and safety reasons”. “My hope is that Woodside thinks better of its position, and figures out how to comply with this new law,” Wiener said. Or there’s an option that some critics have offered: return all the land to the mountain lions that once prowled there freely.",News/US news,Wealthy California town cites mountain lion habitat to deny affordable housing ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/05/california-woodside-mountain-lions-development

2/5/2022,"Charles Dickens was the first to use the popular expression “the queen’s weather” in print, in a humorous account of the opening of parliament on 4 February 1851: “The sky was cloudless; a brilliant sun gave to it that cheering character which – from the good fortune Her Majesty experiences whenever she travels, or appears publicly – has passed into a proverb, as ‘The Queen’s Weather’.” Dickens may have been writing tongue-in-cheek. Two diaries from the Met Office’s archives describe broken cloud and near-freezing conditions in London – “A dry, bitter day,” Mr A Edwin of Islington called it.  But the occasion might have been fairly sunny, and people still talked about glorious queen’s weather without irony almost half a century later. Horace Plunkett MP noted on 3 July 1897: “Went to Windsor with the whole House of Commons (except the Nationalists) & their wives to see the Queen. Queen’s weather.” Plunkett’s visit was during the diamond jubilee celebrations, when an anticyclone brought a prolonged spell of warm weather to the country. The sun cannot have shone on Queen Victoria as reliably as it never set on her empire. But a patriotic form of confirmation bias, the mental tendency to remember only what supports our beliefs, may have rooted the association between the queen and fine weather in the public consciousness.",News/News,Weatherwatch: the origins of ‘queen’s weather’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/feb/05/weatherwatch-the-origins-of-queens-weather
2/5/2022,"Imet Karen O’ Donoghue of the Happy Tummy Co at Camp Good Life’s autumn event in North Wales last year, and was astounded by her knowledge of all things sourdough. As part of her bread-making course, she uses leftovers in sourdough, to create a “prebiotic bomb” that’s good for gut health. “The great thing about stuffing leftovers into sourdough breads is that it not only uses them up, it also extends the bread’s shelf life,” she explains.  I’ve adapted Karen’s recipe here, which she assures me can be stuffed with sweet or savoury leftovers, and anything from leftover apple crumble and brownies to pesto pasta and roast dinner; my version uses leftover roast pumpkin and kale. Karen warns that stuffed breads such as this can be tricky to master on the first attempt, and says it’s important to make sure the stuffing is all folded into the dough and not stuck to the outside. 400g sweet or savoury leftovers225g sourdough starter1kg strong organic stone milled flour – Karen uses a mixture of 650g wholewheat, 200g white and 150g einkorn flour22g sea salt Put the leftovers in a bowl, roughly mash to a paste and refrigerate. Mix the active sourdough starter with 700ml warm water, then stir in the flourand leave in a warm place to autolyse for an hour. Add the sea salt and another 50ml warm water, then leave for 45 minutes. Stretch and fold the dough by picking up a corner, pulling it across the dough and pressing it down. Fold the other three “corners” of the dough in the same way, then repeat the 45-minute resting and folding process twice more. Thirty-five minutes after the last fold, pre-shape the dough on a worktop. Dust the surface of the dough lightly with flour, flip it over and carefully pull out each corner of the dough out to make a rough square. Pull the top left corner down into the centre of the dough and push down. Repeat from the top right corner, then in turn from the middle left, middle right, bottom left and bottom right. Finish by rolling the knitted dough into a neat ball from the top to the bottom. Set aside to rest for another 30 minutes, then do the final shape: lightly dust the surface of the dough with flour again, flip over and carefully pull out each corner to form a square. Spread the leftovers paste over the dough, then repeat the six folds process above, to knit the dough into a parcel and seal in the paste. Finish by rolling the knitted dough into a neat ball from the top to the bottom and transfer to a proving basket. All the paste should remain inside the dough, so don’t overwork it. Leave the shaped dough for 30 minutes at room temperature, then put in the fridge overnight. After eight to 12 hours, when the dough has risen by half, heat a heavy, cast-iron pot for which you have a lid, or a baker’s cloche or similar in a 240C (220C fan)/475F/gas 9 oven. Lift out the casserole, flip the dough into it, cover and bake for 20 minutes. Turn down the heat to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7, remove the lid and bake for another 20 minutes. Remove the bread and leave to cool before slicing.",Lifestyle/Food,Fridge full of leftovers?
