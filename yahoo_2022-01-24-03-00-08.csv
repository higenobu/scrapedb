1/24/2022,"With more than 40 tractors, 50 horses, 15 oxen-pulled carriages as well as working dogs and pets heading the march, protesters complained of being unprotected from cheap food imports, and new legislation banning the sale of pets or aimed at protecting wolves, among other problems. “Our villages are dying without any organization lending us a hand,” said Antonio Donoso, a farmer from Madrid. Last year, the government declared the Iberian wolf a protected species and imposed a nationwide hunting ban, angering farmers who claim the law would lead to more attacks on livestock. The Alma Rural (Rural Soul) umbrella group gathered in Madrid more than 300 organizations including farmers and breeders of fighting bulls and pets in a protest to increase visibility for rural problems. The rally follows a recent spat between Consumer Affairs Minister Alberto Garzon and meat producers, after he criticized the environmental impact of mega-farms, calling the meat they produce low-quality and urging Spaniards to rethink their meat-eating habits.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Thousands of Spanish farmers march to demand action,https://news.yahoo.com/thousands-spanish-farmers-march-demand-173056967.html
1/24/2022,"Earlier this week, Apple began requiring that students and teachers in the US verify their identity through authentication service UNiDAYS before they could take advantage of the company’s discounted education pricing. The move closed a long-standing loophole that had allowed almost anyone to save money on an Apple device as long as they weren’t caught in a random check. However, mere days after implementing that requirement, Apple has just as quickly removed it. Per MacRumors, you can once again buy discounted Macs, iPads and other Apple products from the company’s US education website without the need to verify that you’re currently a student or a teacher. The outlet suggests the company may have made the change after some educators and school staff members complained they couldn’t verify their status through UNiDAYS properly, and therefore couldn’t obtain a discount on a product they wanted to buy. It’s unclear if Apple plans to reimplement the requirement once it sorts out any potential issues with the system. For years, Apple has used UNiDAYS in many other countries, including the UK, to ensure only those who qualify for its education discounts can get them. We’ve reached out to the company for comment and more information.",Business/Engadget,Apple pulls verification requirement for US education shoppers,https://news.yahoo.com/apple-removes-unidays-verification-us-education-store-191748103.html
