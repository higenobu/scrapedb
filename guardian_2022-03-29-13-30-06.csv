3/29/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s main spokesman has said that sanctions on trade and oligarchs were akin to “total war” against Russia, and that the west has pushed the Kremlin “into the corner” with Nato expansion, as officials prepare for the resumption of peace talks with Ukraine on Tuesday. Dmitry Peskov said in an interview on American television that the punitive sanctions levelled against Russia were “quite unfriendly” and made the country feel as it were at war with the US and its western allies. The interview came amid more claims from UK and Ukrainian military intelligence that Russia’s war effort is in serious trouble. As the Russian and Ukrainian sides were due to meet in Turkey for a new round of negotiations, the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) said Russia was expected to bolster its flagging war effort by sending more than 1,000 mercenaries from the private Wagner military group into eastern Ukraine as the Kremlin continues to suffer heavy losses. It was highly likely that Russia has been forced to redeploy Wagner personnel from Africa and Syria to eastern Ukraine, the MoD said. Peskov said Russia was “afraid of Nato getting closer to our borders with its military infrastructure. Please take care of that. Don’t push us into the corner. No.” He described sanctions as “enemy, enemy-like for us. We entered the phase, the phase of a total war. And we in Russia, we will feel ourselves amongst war, because western European countries, United States, Canada, Australia, they actually — they actually — they are leading war against us in trade, in economy, in seizing our properties, in seizing our funds, in blocking our financial relations.” Early on Tuesday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for sanctions packages to be “effective and substantial” and took aim at countries that were taking “passive sanctions” against Russia. “There should be no ‘suspended’ sanctions packages – that if the Russian troops do something, then there will be some answer...” Zelenskiy said. “Ukrainians should not die just because someone cannot find enough courage to hand over the necessary weapons to Ukraine,” he said. “Fear always makes you an accomplice.” He also urged countries to have the courage to keep supplying weapons to Ukraine without fear of possible retaliation by Moscow. Zelenskiy hailed military success in Irpin and in parts of Kyiv, and said he had been engaged in a “very active diplomatic day” during which he had spoken to British prime minister Boris Johnson, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Italian prime minister Mario Draghi and the president of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev. When Peskov was asked about whether Russia would use nuclear weapons in the conflict, he said “no one is thinking” about such a strategy and that Russia would complete its military objectives. Questions about Russia’s military capability were raised on Tuesday by Ukrainian intelligence, which claimed that Putin was compensating for his “weakened, disoriented” forces by trying to destroy cities through “indiscriminate artillery fire and rocket-bomb attacks”. The damning intelligence assessments from the UK and Ukraine came as Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are due to meet for peace talks in Turkey on Tuesday where the main issues on the table are expected to be Ukraine’s neutrality and the status of contested areas in the east. Kyiv has made it clear that it will make no concessions on territorial integrity. However, the opening of talks could be overshadowed by reports that the Russian billionaire, Roman Abramovich, and a Ukrainian peace negotiator suffered symptoms consistent with poisoning earlier this month, according to a source with direct knowledge of the incident. Abramovich was taking part in informal peace negotiations in Kyiv early in March when he began to feel ill, the source told the Guardian. Ukrainian MP Rustem Umerov was also part of the negotiation, and was also reportedly affected too. Both men, who consumed only chocolate and water, were treated in Istanbul for symptoms which reportedly included loss of sight and peeling skin. The account backs up the claims of a potential poisoning first reported in the Wall Street Journal and by the investigative outlet Bellingcat. Putin’s failure to make significant gains in the early weeks of the war and fierce local resistance has bolstered Zelenskiy’s government. Ukraine’s president will be further encouraged by news that Ukrainian troops have regained control of the Kyiv commuter town of Irpin, scene of heavy fighting since the early days of the invasion. Ukraine’s military intelligence said its forces continued to defend Kyiv and other towns including Motyzhyn, Lisne, Kapitanivka and Dmytrivka. Ukrainian forces “continue to maintain the circular defence of the city of Mariupol and defend and deter the advance of the enemy in the Chernihiv region” the report added, although UK intelligence said the Russians were gaining ground in Mariupol. According to the mayor of the besieged southern city, almost 5,000 people, including about 210 children, have been killed in Mariupol since Russia invaded Ukraine last month. Vadym Boichenko said Mariupol was on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe and must be completely evacuated, with about 160,000 civilians were trapped in the city without power. His warning came as Amnesty International said on Tuesday that Russia’s assault on Ukraine is similar to its actions in the Syrian war, raising concerns of “war crimes” as the civilian toll grows a month after Moscow’s invasion. “What is happening in Ukraine is a repetition of what we have seen in Syria,” Agnes Callamard, secretary general of the global rights watchdog, told AFP. Joe Biden on Monday defended his unscripted remarks in Poland at the weekend that Putin “cannot remain in power”, saying it reflected his own moral outrage, not an administration policy shift. “I wasn’t then nor am I now articulating a policy change. I was expressing moral outrage that I felt and I make no apologies,” the US president said. Biden added that he was “not walking anything back” by clarifying the remark. Asked whether the remark would spur a negative response from Putin, Biden said: “I don’t care what he thinks ... He’s going to do what he’s going to do”.",News/World news,"Russia compares sanctions to war as UK says Putin preparing to send 1,000 mercenaries to Ukraine",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/29/russia-compares-sanctions-to-war-as-uk-says-putin-preparing-to-send-1000-mercenaries-to-ukraine
3/29/2022,"Thousands of northern New South Wales residents still reeling from catastrophic flooding are being forced to evacuate their homes for the second time in a month as heavy rainfall lashes Lismore, Mullumbimby and Tumbulgum. The NSW State Emergency Service responded to 14 flood rescues in the 24 hours to 8am Tuesday in already saturated catchments. There were 462 separate requests for assistance. Eight evacuation orders in place on Tuesday afternoon covered more than 6,600 people across Tumbulgum and surrounds, low-lying parts of Mullumbimby and the CBD, low-lying parts of Billinudgel and Kyogle, and Lismore. Early Tuesday afternoon, residents in the Lismore CBD, Lismore Basin, low lying areas of East Lismore and Girards Hill were ordered to evacuate by 4pm with the levee expected to flood above 10.4 metres, cutting off roads. People within low-lying areas of Riverside Caravan Park in Coraki were also told to leave by 7pm as a low pressure system moved down the coast, bringing widespread rainfall of up to 100mm. Jan Praetz, who lives in the centre of Mullumbimby, could not sleep last night as heavy rain lashed her roof. “I was so paranoid … everyone’s on edge and … my anxiety level was off the scale with all that wind and rain and not knowing if it’s going to happen again,” she said. When she received a note from the SES to evacuate, she heeded the warning straight away and headed to the RSL club. Once again, Mullumbimby’s RSL has become a place of refuge for weary, traumatised residents and their pets escaping rising flood waters. Praetz said she was being cautious this time around because she was still “freaked out” from the last flooding event. She hadn’t seen a flood in the main street or had water in her house for 50 years, until four weeks ago. “It certainly makes you question whether you should stay here or whether you should put your house up higher,” Praetz said. “I don’t feel safe and comfortable like I did.” Businesses still continuing with cleanup were scrambling to prepare for the incoming rainwater. South Lismore craft brewery Two Mates Brewing had just reopened a temporary tap house while rebuilding when another evacuation warning hit. On Monday evening, the small business went on the backpedal, seeking a trailer to transport a forklift donated in the previous flood. About $20,000 had been raised by a GoFundMe the two owners had established after the first flooding event for damages not covered by an “enormous” insurance premium. Recreation centre Rollerworld in North Lismore had spent Monday evening packing up cleaning equipment and items that had been salvaged in the past floods. “We’re going to be cleaning items we only just cleaned,” owner Craig Newby said. In the most recent floods, water reached 6.5 metres in the low-lying building. “We had just cleaned all of the walls and were almost at the stage of rebuilding,” Newby said. “Yesterday we packed everything up again … we just don’t want to break the levee again because premiums are so high we’re not ensured.” Friends of Rollerworld’s had also established a GoFundMe for the club, which has been in operation in 1979. “I’ve had people calling up saying they used to skate here 30 years ago,” Newby said. Lismore psychologist Karen Potter said her community had been in a “post-traumatic state” for the past month and the recent flood warning had “amplified everything”. “When people are still in survival mode and don’t have a home to live in or don’t have clothes,you can’t process deeper psychological emotions,” she said. Potter said many of her clients still weren’t living in their homes or were in bare houses as this round of flood warnings hit northern NSW. Potter’s own rooms were flooded out a month prior, and with power still uninstalled for many Lismore businesses, she had been providing sessions over Zoom and phone. But there was only so much she could do at this stage. “When I first went into Lismore and went to see our rooms and went through the town it was overwhelming … the catastrophic devastation that’s happened,” she said. “Clients I have … can’t leave their homes, they’re living without reception and it’s happening again. It’s too soon to talk when you’re thinking ‘I can’t sit down and have a conversation because I need to be prepared to evacuate’. “This is going to take a lot of time. Nobody knows what’s going to happen to Lismore as a town. This is a place a lot of people have lived all their lives.” There were 12 flood warnings in place across NSW on Tuesday morning including major flood warnings for the Tweed, Richmond and Wilsons rivers. The wild weather conditions had also caused rough seas, expected to peak at between four and six metres on Thursday, with beach erosion possible. About 4,600 personnel on the ground in NSW as part of the recovery effort were being diverted to the unfolding emergency.

3/29/2022,"Bitcoin mining already uses as much energy as Sweden, according to some reports, and its booming popularity is revitalizing failing fossil fuel enterprises in the US. But all that could change with a simple switch in the way it is coded, according to a campaign launched on Tuesday. The campaign, called Change the Code Not the Climate and coordinated by Environmental Working Group, Greenpeace USA and several groups battling bitcoin mining facilities in their communities, is calling on bitcoin to change the way bitcoins are mined in order to tackle its outsized carbon footprint. The software code that bitcoin uses – known as “proof of work” – requires the use of massive computer arrays to validate and secure transactions. Proof of work is a way of checking that a miner has solved the extremely complex cryptographic puzzles needed to add to the bitcoin ledger. Rival cryptocurrency etherium is shifting to another system – “proof of stake” – that it believes will reduce its energy use by 99%. In the proof of stake model, miners pledge their coins to verify transactions; adding inaccurate information leads to penalties. With the value and use of cryptocurrencies rising, the campaign’s organizers argue bitcoin must follow suit or find another, less energy intensive, method. “This is a big problem. In part because of where the industry stands now but also because of our concerns about its growth,” said Michael Brune, campaign director and former executive director of Sierra Club. The US now leads the world in cryptocurrency mining after China launched a crackdown on mining and trading last May. “Coal plants which were dormant or slated to be closed are now being revived and solely dedicated to bitcoin mining. Gas plants, which in many cases were increasingly economically uncompetitive, are also now being dedicated to bitcoin mining. We are seeing this all across the country,” said Brune. Brune added: “It’s particularly painful to see this in the electric sector because that is precisely the place where the US has made most of its progress in the last decade,” he said. “There’s no way we can reach our climate goals if we are reviving fossil fuel plants. Some bitcoin miners have recently begun powering their operations using renewable energy from wind and solar. But Brune said while such moves were “clearly well-intentioned”, adding “some boutique wind or solar operations powering a few high- profile mining operations” would not do enough to counter the environmental cost. “Fossil fuel growth is outpacing renewable growth in bitcoin mining and that’s the fundamental challenge,” Brune said. Without a change to the code, the fundamental problem will remain that bitcoin’s code “incentivizes maximum energy use”, said Chris Larsen, founder and executive chairman of crypto company Ripple and a climate activist. “The minute that there is the opportunity to go to something dirty, which is what you are seeing, that is going to happen.” One “nightmare scenario”, he said, is that the world does get to a renewable future in China, the US and EU but countries rich in fossil fuel switch to bitcoin mining to keep their operations running. “Imagine the Saudis sitting on all that oil, which has a cost of about ½ cent per kilowatt hour – no renewable can match that,” Larsen said. “Bitcoin mining could be this endless monetization engine for fossil fuels. That would be a nightmare.” The campaign is launching with digital advertising in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Marketwatch, Politico, Facebook and other publications. Organizers are also taking legal action against proposed mining sites and using their large memberships to push bitcoin’s biggest investors and influencers to call for a code change. “In this world, with all these smart people, there has got to be a better solution,” said Larsen.

3/29/2022,"When much of Kharkiv’s city centre was demolished by Russian airstrikes at the start of Moscow’s invasion, the city’s historic House of the Word was among hundreds of buildings hit. The block of flats, built by the Soviets in the 1920s for Ukrainian writers and poets of Kharkiv’s dynamic literary scene, was later a site for brutal purges in the 1930s, with dozens of intellectuals killed. Now Moscow has hit its residents again. “It’s been almost a hundred years and it feels like history is repeating itself,” said Ivan Senin, a local poet, as the sound of heavy shelling echoed through the garden of Kharkiv’s Literary Museum, which is just a 10-minute walk from the House of the Word. Founded after independence to celebrate Ukrainian culture and inspire a new generation, the museum has a courtyard that is lined with portraits of famous Ukrainian poets and writers – from Taras Shevchenko, the grandfather of Ukrainian literature, to the Kharkiv literary stars of the 1920s and the famous “Sixtiers” generation who started publishing Ukrainian works in the early 60s. They all have one thing in common, said Senin. They were repressed for trying to promote Ukrainian culture. Since the war began he feels history is repeating, and his generation is taking inspiration from the resistance of the past. “You can’t say this is the same situation,” said Senin, noting that the current generation of Ukrainian writers is the first to live through an all-out war with Russia. “But everything they were talking about, is still happening today – Russian chauvinism, their desire to be in control [of Ukraine].” Senin and other Kharkiv writers who work with the museum, including award-winning poet and novelist Serhiy Zhadan, have decided to stay in the city despite the constant shelling and are working to boost morale by organising readings. eeeIn the early 1920s, Ukrainian artists and writers had flocked to Kharkiv, then the capital of Soviet Ukraine, making it an avant-garde hub, said Markian Dobczansky, an academic who specialises in Kharkiv culture during the Soviet era. But as the House of the Word apartment building was finished in 1929, Joseph Stalin began to crack down on Ukrainian intellectuals whose exploration of their national identity threatened his desire to dictate the direction of the Soviet culture. Getting a flat there had seemed like great luck, but became a curse. A total of 33 writers living there were executed; six were sent to forced labour camps, three of whom never returned, and two kill themselves. The scale of the killings meant the period became known as the “executed Renaissance”. “One of the necessary steps on the way to building a dictatorship is to destroy alternative centres of power,” said Dobczansky. “Having [writers]... who had different ideas than Stalin was a kind of intellectual challenge for the whole Soviet enterprise.” Sanctioned Soviet Ukrainian culture was then limited to its non-politicised aspects such as folk dancing, said Dobczansky. Still today, Ukrainian culture cannot be separated from politics. “There’s no way for [Ukrainian culture] to have an independent direction of development without it offending the sensibilities of the Russian state,” said Dobczansky, adding that the Russian state denies the existence of Ukrainian identity. Because Kharkiv is Russian speaking, close to the border, and the country’s capital in the early Soviet era, Moscow apparently expected its troops to be welcomed there. Perhaps officials even saw the city as a possible capital again, for the eastern half of a partitioned Ukraine. But it has always had a strong Ukrainian identity that Moscow overlooked, as one of the birthplaces of the Ukrainian national movement two centuries ago, and an intellectual hub in the early 20th century. “Russia has a real blind spot when it comes to Kharkiv,” said Dobczansky. “Kharkivians claim Ukrainian identity in their own way... They are Russian speaking, yes, but that’s a whole different thing than your political identity. “There’s already been a generation of kids who went to Ukrainian schools. They speak Russian with each other, but in a political sense, and a kind of worldview sense, they see themselves as belonging to Ukraine.” Only a few ancestors of the original House of the Word residents still live there. The Kharkiv Literary Museum uses a flat there for its residency programme. After the bombing, the apartment building still stands but has smashed windows and damaged walls. Inside the museum, Senin says he has managed to write only one poem since the war started as he struggles to process his emotions. It is a testament to how Russia’s invasion has destroyed any dreams of a Russian Kharkiv. No one invited them here to roamFuck all the predictions made.Those who are attacking our homeWill never be forgiven for the raid.

3/29/2022,"It is the disappearing lake that hasn’t vanished for six years. Lough Funshinagh in the west of Ireland usually drains through a “swallow hole”, as if someone has pulled the plug in a bath. But for an unknown reason nature’s plumbing in this turlough has broken down, flooding an area thought to be twice the lake’s usual size and threatening homes and livelihoods. Last week, Roscommon county council halted work to drain the lake artificially with a 2.5-mile (4km) pipeline to the nearby River Shannon after the campaign group Friends of the Irish Environment took the local authority to the high court on the grounds that no environmental impact assessment had been carried out, breaching EU rules. A high court order halting the flood relief has set off a bitter row, with some local residents arguing that Ireland’s scientists and political leaders would be pulling out all the stops to find a solution if it were homes in coastal Dublin that were under threat. Mary Beattie’s home has been surrounded by industrial-sized sandbags for more than a year and her garden has partially flooded. “There are even life belts here,” the 69-year-old said, pointing to her submerged farmland. “Did you ever see anything like it?” Beattie said she would move on to the top of floor of her house if it became inundated. With flood relief now at a standstill, local residents say they have been abandoned and that far from being protected, the environment has been damaged by inaction. Rare Bewick’s and whooper swans, curlews and the unusual fauna supported by the seasonal waters have all disappeared. “The law is the winner here, nobody else,” said Geraldine Murray, who lives locally.. She remembered scores of swans nesting on the shores when she was a child. Now they are gone, as are the geese, and other wildlife. Standing on what looks like a mangrove thicket in the waters inundating his farm, Tom Carney said the flooding was “an awful affliction” for the community. “The sad thing is nobody knows what happened,” the 70-year-old said. “Whether it is because of climate change or the collapse in the underground caverns or some obstruction that has got in the way, nobody knows.” Funshinagh is one of the largest turloughs in Ireland and is officially considered “of major ecological importance” a Priority 1 habitat under EU law. It is served by both surface water during heavy rainfall and groundwater through springs bubbling up from the karst limestone bedrock. Carney said he remembered when the lake used to slowly drain dry, disappearing down the swallow hole and making a whirlpool-like noise as the last water disappeared underground. According to the International Association of Hydrogeologists (pdf), the water level rose by 2 metres above normal levels in 2016, causing extensive and prolonged flooding. “Based on the slow outflow, it was calculated that it would take 600 days or two years for the floodwaters to drain and that would assume no further flood events,” the IAH said in a 2018 report. Farmers in the area do not want the lake to drain completely, but fear the situation for the habitat and their homes will worsen if after a relatively dry winter they are faced with another deluge next winter. Septic tanks will be flooded, sending effluent into what has been recognised as some of the cleanest lake water in the country, they said. “Us farmers, we just want it to regulate itself, we just want to protect the environment like we did before with respect and dignity to all the natural wildlife,” said Bernadette Mee, pointing to acres of decades-old ash and native larch killed by the flooding on her farm. She like Murray and Carney say the irony is the habitat the EU law is designed to protect has been destroyed. This time of the year, the air above the shoreline should be filled with feathers and the chitter-chatter of birds, Mee said. “The birds you hear are behind you, they are not on the lough, there are no swans, no geese on the lough, there’s nothing. The reed beds are gone, they have no cover.” Mee said that before 2016, the water was difficult to see such was the expanse of rushes and reed beds. The vegetation supported swans by giving them cover and because they could feed off the tadpoles and nutrients on the lake floor. Roscommon county council said it had “left no stone unturned trying to find a mechanism to deliver urgent emergency relief that would ensure families could stay in their homes”, but added that it had been questioned every step of the way by Friends of the Irish Environment. Eoin Brady, a lawyer for campaign group, said the council had twice “sought to approve a project to abstract a very significant volume of water” from a protected habitat without conducting environmental assessments, as legally required to do. “If Roscommon County Council had proceeded as they had originally intended by undertaking a lawful scheme, it is entirely possible that flood relief measures would be in place by now at Lough Funshinagh. There is an important lesson for public authorities from the outcome of these legal proceedings that in dealing with the impacts of climate change that the longest way around is usually the shortest way home,” he said.

3/29/2022,"Victoria’s opposition leader, Matthew Guy, has called for an end of mandatory isolation for Covid close contacts – while in isolation himself after a positive test result in his family. Guy, who is spending the next seven days in isolation with his family after his son Alex tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday morning, said he has no symptoms and could be at work. He claimed half the state was in “semi-lockdown” as a result of the rules. “I’m negative. The other boys and [wife] Renae are all negative but that’s what Victorians are living with. No wonder half the state’s in a semi-lockdown because we’re all in isolation,” he told reporters during a press conference held over Zoom. His comments came after the premier, Daniel Andrews, on Monday revealed he had tested positive for Covid and was isolating with his family. Guy said many hospitality businesses were struggling with staff shortages as a result of the isolation rules, with some owners telling him they are concerned they won’t be able to open over the Easter period. Several workers in other industries, including health and emergency services, transport and freight and food production have been exempt from close contact isolation rules since January and are able to attend work provided they have no symptoms, test negative on rapid antigen tests and wear a mask. Guy said all close contacts who have no symptoms and test negative on rapid antigen tests should be allowed to leave isolation. “You’ve got to apply common sense,” he said. “If you’re doing tests and you’re negative, and you feel fine, then you should get on with life. That’s the most sensible way to conduct yourself. That’s how other states are doing it. I just don’t see why, in Victoria, we’ve got thousands of people sitting at home who are constantly reporting negative tests. “This is now the third year of the pandemic and these laws are still holding us back, they are still holding the state back. The state government is still obsessed with making laws to hold us all back. It’s about time we just recovered and got on with our lives.” Earlier this month, the federal government asked the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee to provide urgent advice to national cabinet on the transition away from isolation for close contacts. Both the Victorian and New South Wales governments have also indicated they are working on plans to allow fully vaccinated close contacts who have no symptoms to leave isolation, provided they return regular negative rapid antigen tests. However, no states have scrapped close contact isolation at this stage. Guy confirmed the deputy Liberal leader, David Southwick, will take his place for the next seven days but he will continue to work from home. “It doesn’t stop now that I’ve got the ability to get on these Zooms,” he said. “The coffee machine will get a year’s worth of work in one week, I suspect.”",News/Australia news,Matthew Guy criticises Victoria’s Covid close contact rules after going into isolation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/29/matthew-guy-criticises-victorias-covid-close-contact-rules-after-going-into-isolation
