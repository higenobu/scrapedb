5/17/2022,"Video showing Vladimir Putin twitching his foot set off new speculation about his health. The secretive leader's condition is under scrutiny after Ukraine claimed he is seriously ill. Some believe illness could make him more reckless in the war in Ukraine and confronting the West. A clip showing Vladimir Putin twitching his leg in a meeting in Moscow with Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon set off a new flurry of online speculation about the Russian president's health Monday. In the meeting, where the leaders discussed security issues in central Asia, Putin appears to jerk his foot several times. MailOnline published a version of the video: The evidence is slight, but was seized upon amid tensions with the West over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Clips from meetings where Putin was seen gripping a table or awkwardly moving his leg have also fuelled speculation about his health. Experts have weighed in with more credible information, with former British spy Christopher Steele on Sunday claiming that Russian sources had informed him that Putin was fatally ill. A Ukrainian intelligence chief in an interview with Sky News over the weekend also claimed that Putin is in ""very bad psychological and physical condition and he is very sick"", and rejected the suggestion he was making the claims as part of Ukraine's information war with Russia. A Russian oligarch also said, in a recently-released secret recording, that he had been informed by Kremlin sources that Putin had blood cancer. No evidence has emerged to substantiate these claims. In his first decade in power, Putin sought to portray himself as a vigorous action man, riding a horse bare-chested, piloting a light aircraft, and vanquishing opponents on the hockey pitch in propaganda stunts. But the Russian leader, who is approaching 70, now casts a very different figure in his public appearances. Putin holds meetings with foreign leaders across a vast table, and has appeared bloated and agitated when pictured with top Kremlin officials and allies. Respected Russian investigative outlet Proekt, in a recent article detailed Putin's health problem during his presidency. It claimed the Kremlin closely controls what footage is released of Putin to cover any abnormalities and obscure times that he is absent from public life for medical treatment. It said he suffers back problems, and may have been treated for thyroid illness. In recent weeks, there has been speculation that Putin's jerky movements and bloated appearance indicate he may have Parkinson's, though experts on the disease expressed skepticism towards that claim in comments to German broadcaster Deutsche Welle. Mark Galeotti, one of the UK's leading experts on Russia's security services, in a recent article for The Spectator cautioned against some of the wilder speculation about Putin's health, that he said was indicative of wishful thinking. ""The idea of Putin succumbing to some malady is, like that other topic of over-heated speculation, the palace coup, often a hope for some quick, magic answer to the West's problems,"" he wrote. ""Yet beware magical thinking. The prevailing medical opinions appear to be that whatever Putin may have, it is not likely to lead to imminent death or incapacitation. It may well be that he is ill enough to be more reckless and less concerned about the long-term risks, but not so ill to quickly be out of the picture.""

5/17/2022,"(Reuters) -The Kremlin said on Tuesday it would be ""outright theft"" for the Group of Seven economic powers and European Union to seize Russia's frozen reserves and spend them on behalf of Ukraine. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner told four European newspapers that he was open to the idea of seizing Russian state assets to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine and that proposals to that effect were already being discussed among the G7 and in the EU. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that no one had informed Russia of such an initiative, which he said would be ""illegal, blatant and of course requiring an appropriate response... It would be, in fact, outright theft."" The Group of Seven major Western powers banned transactions with Russia's central bank and froze its assets held in their jurisdictions, worth around $300 billion, after Russia launched what it called its special military operation in Ukraine in February.

5/17/2022,"LONDON (AP) — Queen Elizabeth II made a surprise visit Tuesday to a train station in central London to see a newly completed subway line named in her honor. The 96-year-old monarch, who has reduced most of her public engagements, appeared Tuesday at Paddington Station and beamed as she unveiled a plaque stating she officially opened the Elizabeth Line. The new east-west train line is due to open to the public on May 24. Calling the event “a happy development,” Buckingham Palace said ""the organizers were informed of the possibility she may attend.” The queen, who wore a sunshine yellow outfit with matching hat, walked slowly as she toured the station with a cane in hand, and she was seen smiling as she met with train workers. The queen was also given an Oyster card and shown how to use it on a ticket machine. She was joined by her youngest son, Prince Edward, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the official visit. “We’re all incredibly touched and moved and grateful to her Majesty for coming to open the Elizabeth Line today,"" Johnson said. ""It was fantastic to see her.” Tuesday’s appearance is the queen's first one outside the Windsor area, where she resides, since the monarch attended a memorial service for her late husband Prince Philip at central London's Westminster Abbey seven weeks ago. The monarch made her first public appearance in weeks on Friday when she attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show, watching her beloved equines perform. On Sunday, she looked relaxed as the guest of honor at an equestrian show near Windsor attended by celebrities, including Tom Cruise and Helen Mirren. Her public appearances are being closely watched as Britain prepares to celebrate the monarch’s 70 years on the throne with four days of Platinum Jubilee festivities June 2-5. Last week, she asked her son and heir to the throne Prince Charles to preside over the state opening of Parliament and deliver the Queen’s Speech, which lays out the government’s legislative program. Palace officials have said she is experiencing “episodic mobility problems” in recent months and has difficulties moving around.",World/Associated Press,Queen makes surprise appearance to mark new subway line,https://news.yahoo.com/queen-makes-surprise-appearance-mark-111439881.html
