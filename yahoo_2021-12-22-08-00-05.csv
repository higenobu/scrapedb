12/22/2021,"An Amazon delivery driver in Las Vegas recently had to make an unscheduled stop – to save a woman and small dog being attacked by a pit bull. Lauren Ray, 19, was outside on Dec. 13 when an unleashed pit bull attacked her family's smaller dog, Max. Ray picked up Max and attempted to fend off the dog's attack, captured on video by the family's Ring doorbell camera. ""My first thought was 'Save the dog,'"" Ray told Fox 5 Las Vegas. ""I would’ve let the dog bite me for all I care. I just wanted him to be safe because he’s so small, compared to a pit bull, he didn’t stand a chance."" However, Ray was unable to fend off the pit bull which continued to circle and snap at her and Max. Her scream for help was soon answered by Amazon delivery driver Stephanie Lontz who put herself between the dog and Ray and told her to get in the house.

Lauren's father, Michael Ray, a real estate agent, was about to show a home when he got a notification from his Ring cam and saw the incident unfold. He was in ""panic mode,"" he told Fox 5. ""I’m a half-hour away from the house. It’s literally like I’m watching a football game and screaming at it, ‘Get in the house. Get in the house.'"" Then, he saw the Amazon driver swoop ""in like Wonder Woman"" and give Lauren Ray time to get herself and Max inside. Before departing, the driver hollered at the pit bull, ""You're a bad dog!"" The Rays posted video of the incident in hopes of finding the driver who intervened, according to Fox 5 Las Vegas. And this past weekend, they were able to meet Lontz and thank her in person. ""I would have been lost without any help,"" Lauren Ray said. ""I had no clue what I was going to do. I didn’t know if I was going to get hurt. And someone risking their life like that is a really big thing and means a lot to me."" Lontz said hearing Ray's screams ""made me think of my own child. I would only hope that somebody would jump in and help her if she was in a similar situation. It's the human thing to do."" It's not unusual for Amazon delivery drivers to come across similar incidents, Lontz said. ""Two days prior I had been bit by a dog. Two days before that, I saved a baby who wasn’t even two 2-years-old yet locked in a house,"" she said. ""We really do go through a lot and we’re there when other people aren’t. Sometimes it’s not even recognized. I have a coworker who put out a fire in a backyard the other day."" In addition to a thank you from the Rays, Lontz was also met with gifts and balloons from co-workers and members of Local 702 Logistics, the local courier company contracted by Amazon. Soon after the incident, the local animal control department picked up the dog, Fox 5 Las Vegas reported. This comes months after another heroic Amazon driver's action: killing a big spider menacing the front door of a Texas customer getting a delivery. Follow Mike Snider on Twitter: @mikesnider.

12/22/2021,"At AmericaFest, a four-day festival hosted by Turning Point USA in Phoenix, recently acquitted Kyle Rittenhouse was greeted with a hero’s welcome— complete with streamers, music, and a standing ovation from the convention crowd as if he were a wrestling champion. After he spoke on a panel, he was then asked by journalist Elad Eliahu why he expressed support for Black Lives Matter.
 Elad Eliahu was then held away from Rittenhouse and got his press pass removed. Later, Eliahu posted a video showing the confrontation at Turning Point USA’s Americafest on his Twitter account.

Rittenhouse claims his ex-attorney set him up. To restate his comments: “I’m not a racist person. I support the BLM movement. I support peacefully demonstrating,” Rittenhouse told Fox News’ Tucker Carlson in an interview that aired Monday night. Kyle Rittenhouse does support Black Lives Matter. There’s a weirdness in this story: you get kicked out of the four-day festival if you even mention Black Lives Matter like it’s Candyman in a mirror. So, let’s consider Kyle Rittenhouse does support Black Lives Matter. It’s crazy how three words upset enough people to cause these outbursts. To reiterate for the people in the back, Black lives saying that they matter doesn’t take away from anyone else’s value.

12/22/2021,"BOULDER, Colo. (AP) — Twenty-five years after JonBenet Ramsey was killed, police say DNA hasn’t been ruled out to help solve the case. The 6-year-old was found dead in the basement of her family’s Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996, bludgeoned and strangled, several hours after her mother called 911 to say her daughter was missing and a ransom note had been left behind. Her death was ruled a homicide, but nobody was ever charged in the case. Boulder police have been working closely with state investigators on “future DNA advancements,"" the department said in a statement Monday addressing the anniversary of JonBenet’s death. “As the Department continues to use new technology to enhance the investigation, it is actively reviewing genetic DNA testing processes to see if those can be applied to this case moving forward,” it said.  In recent years, investigators have identified suspects in unsolved cases by comparing DNA profiles from crime scenes and to DNA testing results shared online by people researching their family trees, i ncluding the Golden State Killer in California. In Oregon earlier this year, a man was accused of killing two people who disappeared 20 years apart after forensic genealogy linked him to the 1999 disappearance and presumed death of one of them. Christopher Lovrien has pleaded not guilty to murder charges.   It's unclear if this is the method investigators plan to apply to the JonBenet case. A police spokesperson, Dionne Waugh, said she could not comment further because the investigation is still “active and ongoing.” Investigators have analyzed nearly 1,000 DNA samples during the course of the Ramsey investigation, police said in the statement, along with receiving, reviewing or investigating more than 21,016 tips, letters and emails. Detectives have traveled to 19 states to interview or speak with more than 1,000 people in connection with the case, the department said.  Tests in 2008 on newly discovered DNA on JonBenet’s clothing pointed to the involvement of an “unexplained third party” in her slaying, and not her parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, or their son, Burke. That led former district attorney Mary Lacy to clear the Ramseys of any involvement, two years after Patsy Ramsey died of cancer, calling the couple “victims of this crime.” The police department was criticized for its initial handling of the investigation into the death of JonBenet, who had competed in beauty pageants.  The details of the crime and video footage of JonBenet from the pageants propelled the case into one of the highest-profile mysteries in the United States, unleashing a series of true-crime books and TV specials.",U.S./Associated Press,Police won't rule out DNA to solve 1996 JonBenet killing,https://news.yahoo.com/police-eye-genetic-dna-25-191642322.html
12/22/2021,"The father of slain 6-year-old Jace Young is lashing out against liberal San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin's ""broken"" criminal justice system as his son’s convicted killer could serve less time in prison than the age of the boy who was shot to death. When gunfire rang out on July 4, 2020, in San Francisco's Bayview District as neighbors were outside for a fireworks show, bullets struck 6-year-old Jace Young, who was rushed to the hospital but did not survive. Investigators quickly identified two of the assumed four gunmen, then-17-year-old Deshaune Lumpkin and 18-year-old James Harbor. But months would pass before Harbor was arrested on Jan. 6, and more time would go by before Lumpkin was apprehended on Aug.11 – over a year from when Young was killed. SAN FRANCISCO POLICE MAKE SECOND ARREST OVER A YEAR AFTER 6-YEAR-OLD BOY SHOT DURING FIREWORKS SHOW Following a two-week hearing in juvenile court, Lumpkin, now 18, was found guilty Monday of four of the six counts against him related to the child’s Fourth of July killing. But the slain boy’s father, Jason Young, said the guilty verdict was no victory and has left his family ""devastated"" because Boudin ran on the campaign promise of never allowing an offender who commits a crime when he or she is under 18 to be tried as an adult – no matter how heinous the offense might be. Boudin, a Democrat who’s been at the helm of the Bay-Area prosecutor’s office since the start of 2020, is facing a second recall effort after the first attempt at his ouster failed earlier this year. Because he was tried as a juvenile, Lumpkin can only be held for a maximum of eight years until his 25th birthday. And despite the shooters only being months apart in age, Harbor, now 19, was tried as an adult and is potentially facing 50 years to life for Young’s death. ""I am so angry with Chesa Boudin right now. He makes San Francisco’s criminal justice system a complete joke,"" the boy's father said. ""The killer of my 6-year-old son will likely serve less time than the age of my son because of Chesa's campaign promise. Boudin's campaign promises do not protect San Franciscans and ensure justice – they only allow criminals, and in this case, murderers, to return to the community."" The elder Young, whose statement was distributed by a group leading the second recall effort against Boudin, further asserted that San Francisco has a district attorney and public defenders aiding criminals, ""while crime victims and residents have no one fighting for them."" ""Some wonder why the Black community doesn't have faith in the justice system,"" the grieving father continued. ""We cannot help but feel that if this had happened to a White child in another neighborhood, we would not be having this discussion; we would not have this result from a dismissive, out-of-touch district attorney. At the very least there would be some real accountability in Jace’s case."" ""As the cycle of violence continues in San Francisco, our family and everyone else affected by this senseless crime and lack of accountability is traumatized,"" Young said. ""To be a victim of crime in San Francisco is a complete nightmare under District Attorney Boudin. This is just another example of how he is failing our community and the city of San Francisco. This isn’t justice for Jace, and this isn’t what our city deserves either. No family should ever go through what we are going through."" Responding to a Fox News Digital request for comment, Boudin's spokeswoman, Rachel Marshall, did not address the decision to try Lumpkin as a juvenile or his potential short sentence following his conviction. ""Our heart breaks for the Young family, whom our Victim Services Division has continued to support,"" Marshall said in an emailed statement. ""We secured a guilty verdict yesterday in juvenile court against one defendant, and we are awaiting trial to start for the adult, whom we are prosecuting for murder as well. We are committed to holding accountable those responsible for this tragic crime.""",U.S./Fox News,San Francisco dad of slain 6-year-old slams liberal DA Chesa Boudin: Making 'justice system a complete joke',https://news.yahoo.com/san-francisco-dad-slain-6-192035758.html
12/22/2021,"The U.S. Marshals Service won’t provide a full-time security detail to the first Black U.S. attorney confirmed to that post in Massachusetts, leaving her without that federal protection although she’s receiving escalating death threats. The Senate confirmed Rachael Rollins to the post earlier this month. During the confirmation, Republicans characterized Rollins as a pro-criminal prosecutor with an “unhinged personality.” Rollins previously refused to prosecute some minor offenses. Threats intensified after Republicans framed Rollins as soft on crime in her job as Suffolk County district attorney. “You’ll probably die,” read one message sent to the Suffolk County District’s Attorney’s Office. “SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE IS PLOTTING TO PUT ONE IN YOUR FACE OR HEAD!!!” read another. Rollins turned over the threats she’s received to the U.S. Marshals Service, requesting a full security detail. But federal officials rejected the argument that the attorney is in serious danger, the Boston Globe reports. People familiar with the situation told the Globe one of the people who sent a threatening message later apologized, and that officials concluded Rollins is at a low risk for becoming the target of violence. Rollins has served as the Suffolk district attorney since 2019 and receives protection from a Boston police unit. She has not yet been sworn in as a U.S. attorney but is set to start the new job in January. The Senate confirmed Rollins, who has led investigations in Boston into police misconduct and invalidated past drug convictions, on Dec. 8 by a vote of 51-50. All Republicans voted against her confirmation, and Vice President Kamala Harris broke the tie. The marshals’ handling of Rollins’ security concerns contrasts with what that the agency did for a Donald Trump Cabinet member. After protesters heckled now-former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in February 2017 during her visit to a Washington middle school, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions granted her 24/7 protection from the marshals. Politico reported last year that DeVos’ security detail cost taxpayers $24 million over a four-year period. At the time, officials defended the use of the tax dollars. “Year after year, the press reports on the cost of the Secretary’s security detail,” Education Department spokesperson Angela Morabito said in a statement. “What goes unreported are the threats to the Secretary’s safety, which necessitate the security detail in the first place. The people who make the threats are at fault here, not the person receiving them.” Rollins has previously highlighted the dangers of the kinds of threats Black women receive. “A lot of people don’t recognize [that] as women and as women of color, and particularly as a Black woman, the level of racist, hate-filled death threats that we receive,” she told GBH’s Greater Boston. On Twitter, users criticized federal officials’ decision not to provide security for Rollins after DeVos was granted a security detail. One user wrote: “Rachael Rollins, the new US Attorney for MA has turned over emails to the Marshals Service that contained death threats on her life, including one that affirmed: “you’ll probably die.” The Service turned down her request for protection. Why did they protect Cruella Betsy DeVos?” Rachael Rollins, the new US Attorney for MA has turned over emails to the Marshals Service that contained death threats on her life, including one that affirmed: “you’ll probably die.” The Service turned down her request for protection.

12/22/2021,"A Tiktoker claiming to be a factory employee has captivated followers after allegedly revealing how Gatorade is made. No shade, but it's time to stop mooching off your parents' Amazon Prime — here's why German Lopez reportedly racked up almost 4 million views for his video, which he has since deleted along with his TikTok account. In the clip, according to outlets that saw it before it was removed, Lopez filmed himself opening a plastic bottle and pouring out red liquid into a sink. Viewers assumed it was a label-less, fruit punch-flavored Gatorade bottle. Look your best this holiday season with top fashion items from Walmart: “Did you know that Gatorade is made at 180 degrees?” Lopez wrote in text overlay on the video. Commenters were stunned by the idea that Gatorade makes its products at such a high temperature. “Red dye, boiling hot, in plastic … I needed this knowledge,” someone wrote, according to The Daily Dot. “No wonder it tastes warm even though it’s been in the fridge for three days,” another person joked, reported Newsweek. Others seemed confused by how the plastic bottles could handle liquid at that temperature. Lopez apparently responded to one of the comments, explaining: “It’s actually pasteurized temperatures to keep from all toxins and then cooled after.” Lopez’s point aligns with what Seth Goldman, the co-founder of Honest Tea, wrote about in a piece for Mic in 2009. Many companies package beverages in plastic bottles via a process called “hot filling,” where the product is heated to pasteurize it and then immediately bottled to keep it sterile. “To pasteurize tea, we have to fill our bottles at 190 degrees. When hot liquid goes into a plastic bottle, the bottle expands — that’s why when you peel off the label of a Gatorade bottle you see expansion panels underneath,” Goldman said.  Goldman added that there are environmental benefits to using lighter plastic bottles for beverages like Gatorade and Honest Tea. “There are obvious environmental benefits for such a package — such a move could eliminate up to 1 million pounds of PET resin on an annual basis. Another advantage of a lighter bottle is that it takes less fuel to ship [before and after filling],” he said. An assistant coach helped invent Gatorade at the University of Florida in the early summer of 1965 after he sat down with a team of physicians to figure out how to combat the heat fatigue and heat-related illnesses he was seeing in athletes.
