5/11/2022,"The Coalition and Labor have promised more than $40m to sporting clubs that benefited from the government’s infamous “sports rorts” grant program, including those with projects ranked with low merit scores and not recommended for funding. A Guardian Australia analysis of election promises made since the beginning of the year shows that the two major parties have promised more than $550m combined to almost 200 different sports clubs in the lead up to the election, with about $260m pledged by the Coalition and $290m promised by Labor. Of these, about $41m has been promised to sporting clubs that received funding under the Community Sport Infrastructure Program, and another $20m to organisations that applied but missed out under the scheme. The auditor general found that the Coalition used the scheme to award $100m in sport grants that were not assessed on their merits in order to favour “targeted” Coalition seats ahead of the May 2019 election. But in a sign that neither side has heeded calls for taxpayer funds to be awarded according to a more rigorous independent assessment process, organisations that were awarded funding against the recommendations of the department are now in line for more election-time cash. This includes $5m promised by the Liberal MP Alan Tudge for the Boronia Hawks Football Netball Club in the seat of Aston for a new pavilion, after the organisation successfully secured $190,000 for a lighting upgrade in the community sports grant program. The lighting project only received a merit score of 54 – well below the 75 threshold judged by the department to represent the most meritorious projects. In the Labor-held marginal seat of Blair, the Liberal National party candidate, Sam Biggins, has promised the Ipswich Basketball Association $3.9m for an expansion of its facilities, after its successful bid for $50,000 for “project improvements” was judged to have a merit score of 58. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Labor, meanwhile, has promised $8.5m to an upgrade of the Nepean Football Club’s Cook Park base in the marginal Liberal-held seat of Lindsay, which received just $15,000 under the sports rorts program for a project with a merit score of 67. The new $8.5m commitment will fund synthetic football fields, walking tracks, grandstand upgrades, outdoor health and fitness equipment, additional car parking, and tree planting and landscape works. Labor will also provide $350,000 for a major upgrade of the Officer Tennis Club in the seat of La Trobe, which received about $40,000 for lighting upgrades despite the project having a merit score of just 60. Several other projects being promised by Labor include some clubs which missed out on funding under the community sports program despite receiving high-ranked assessments, including $3m for the Kingborough Lions United Football Club in Tasmania, $4m for the Langford Indoor Netball Centre in the seat of Burt in Western Australia and $2.4m for Thomas Hall in the WA seat of Brand. The Coalition has also promised funding for organisations that had high merit scores, including an extra $2.5m for the Brothers Rugby Club in Brisbane that received $500,000 for a project ranked at 81 points, and Central Reserve in Colac in the seat of Wannon which received $425,000 after missing out under the community sports program despite having a merit score of 95. Overall, sporting clubs are being lavished with funding promises in the lead up to the 21 May poll, with millions of dollars being directed to marginal seat campaigns on both sides. Sport-related promises have dominated the announcements from both parties, accounting for one-third of Labor’s seat-specific announcements so far, and 15% of the Coalition’s. About half ($270m) of the total $550m has been pledged to sporting groups in marginal seats, including seven of the 10 largest commitments that top $15m each. The largest sports promises of the campaign have been made by Labor, with $25m promised in the marginal Tasmanian seat of Braddon for sports facilities in Devonport, $25m for the Alkimos Aquatic Centre in the marginal seat of Pearce in WA, both held by the Liberal party, and $20m for a stadium in the marginal outer Brisbane seat of Blair held by Labor. The biggest sports promises made by the Coalition include $20m for the North Bellarine Aquatic and Leisure Centre in the Labor-held marginal seat of Corangamite, while in the marginal seat of Dunkley it is promising $15m for the Frankston Basketball Stadium and $15m for the Emil Madsen Reserve. Both the Coalition and Labor have faced questions about their pre-election spending promises, with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, dismissing questions about pork barrelling in the lead up to election day, saying the government supports local communities through grants. “We believe passionately in the role of community organisations as Liberals and Nationals,” Morrison said in the opening week of the election campaign. “What we think is that communities and individuals in communities who take responsibility for their communities, through their not-for-profit organisations, through their local sporting clubs, we think they should be supported. We think they should be backed in. So I’m really pleased that my government has and we’re going to keep doing it.” Asked at the National Press Club about Labor’s decision to fund $200,000 towards dog parks in the marginal seat of Macquarie, Labor’s shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said “there is a time for investment in communities”. “But you need to make sure that that spending is well motivated, that it’s not politically motivated.” The Coalition has also promised $320,000 for a dog park in La Trobe.",News/Australia news,Coalition and Labor pledge $40m of election cash to clubs that benefited from ‘sports rorts’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/coalition-and-labor-pledge-40m-of-election-cash-to-clubs-that-benefited-from-sports-rorts
5/11/2022,"A woman has died in flood waters in north Queensland after her ute was washed away, with authorities warning there is still much more rain to come. Emergency services received reports at around 5am on Wednesday that a dual-cab ute carrying three people had been swept into flood waters at Mount Ossa, north of Mackay. Two passengers, a 50-year-old Mount Charlton man and a 30-year-old Mount Pelion woman, managed to escape the vehicle. Following a frantic search, an emergency crew recovered the body of the driver – a 31-year-old Calen woman – in the vehicle at 8am on Wednesday morning. The 50-year-old man suffered a laceration to his head and both passengers were transported in a stable condition to Mackay Base hospital. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, later confirmed the woman’s death while speaking in parliament. “I offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and I sincerely hope that this is the last tragedy,” Palaszczuk said. She said the incident was “a stark reminder” of the dangers of extreme weather events like the one unfolding in the state’s north this week. Heavy rainfall continues to batter northern Queensland, with almost 300 roads cut and flood warnings in place for numerous rivers and creeks. The SES has responded to more than 110 requests for assistance since 3pm on Tuesday. Townsville is set for totals up to 250mm on Wednesday and Thursday, with the severe weather warning indicating up to 200mm in a six-hour period. “That whole area under the severe weather warning could see flash and riverine flooding,” Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Laura Boekel said on Tuesday. In the south-east, heavy rain also hit the Sunshine Coast and northern Brisbane, with 135mm falling at Mapleton and 113mm at Maleny. News of the woman’s death came after a man in his 20s was pulled from flood waters at Mount Isa on Monday night. Palaszczuk confirmed on Wednesday the man had since been discharged from hospital after being treated for hypothermia. She said emergency services were also called to respond to minor flooding affecting three properties in Townsville but were not required to evacuate the residences. “Queenslanders have done a great job so far, and we know how quickly things will turn from bad to worse and heavy rain and storms here,” Palaszczuk said. “I urge all Queenslanders to please be prepared. Don’t travel unnecessarily on the road roads during the weather ... and always remember if it’s flooded, forget it.” Australian Associated Press contributed to this report",News/Australia news,Queensland floods: woman dies after vehicle is swept away as more heavy rain forecast,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/11/queensland-floods-2022-woman-dies-after-vehicle-car-swept-away-qld-flood-waters-more-heavy-rain-wet-weather-forecast
5/11/2022,"Barnaby Joyce claimed at a candidate’s forum on Monday night that the anti-immigrant, nativist One Nation party led by Pauline Hanson had changed. “The party of 10, 15 years ago is not the party of today,” Joyce said. “Things change. Mollify.” The National party leader was defending his decision to put the little-known One Nation candidate Richard Thomas second on his how-to-vote card in the seat of New England for the upcoming federal election. The One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson, was first elected in 1996, shooting to notoriety after being disendorsed by the Liberal party for comments about Indigenous Australians. In her maiden speech she said Australia was “in danger of being swamped by Asians”. So has the party changed since then, or specifically in the past 10-15 years? Here are some notable incidents since Hanson herself returned to the Senate in 2016: In her first speech upon re-election, she harked back to that 1996 maiden speech, which largely consisted of attacking social support for Indigenous people, and demonising Asian immigration. “That speech was relevant then and it is still relevant today,” she said in 2016, before warning that Muslims were responsible for organised crime, violence, “collapsing social cohesion” and numerous other social ills. In 2017, Hanson used a Senate debate on the Turnbull government’s proposed school funding overhaul to call for autistic and disabled students to be removed from mainstream classrooms, saying other students were being “held back” by “do-gooder” teachers who advocated for their inclusion. Hanson refused to apologise, saying her comments had been “taken out of context”. Two months later, she turned up to the Senate for question time dressed in a burqa. The stunt – roundly condemned in a speech by then attorney general, Liberal senator George Brandis, earning him a bipartisan standing ovation – was intended to support her long-running anti-Muslim campaign, which at the time was focused on banning the garment. Earlier that year, she said: “Islam is a disease; we need to vaccinate ourselves against that”. Joyce denounced those comments as “bat poo crazy”. “This kind of stuff does not help anybody,” he said. “It was just stupid, it was plain dumb.” In 2018, Hanson put a motion to the Senate that reproduced the rhetoric of white supremacist groups, stating there had been a “deplorable rise of anti-white racism and attacks on Western civilisation” and insisting “it is OK to be white”. In 2019, an Al Jazeera investigation exposed senior One Nation figures James Ashby and Steve Dickson seeking millions of dollars of political donations from the National Rifle Association in an attempt to seize the balance of power in Australia and weaken the country’s gun laws. As recently as Sunday night, in response to the leaders’ debate on Channel Nine, NSW One Nation MP Mark Latham made a racist joke on Twitter at the expense of the debate’s moderator and Indigenous Australians. The NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, said Latham’s “thinly veiled racist comment here is clearly deliberate. Race is not a political punchline – words like that are hateful and divisive.” Latham has denied the tweet was racist. Associate prof Paul Williams, political analyst at Griffith University, said that if One Nation had changed, it had merely become more media savvy. “The idea that Pauline Hanson and One Nation have become just another acceptable, middle-of-the-road party is nonsense,” Williams said. “I would argue the party is just as unpalatable – perhaps less palatable – to middle, mainstream and urban Australia than it was in the late 90s.” The major difference between the party then and now, Williams said, was that it has “dropped pretty much all pretence to an economic agenda” – referring to the party’s early protectionist policies. “In the more recent years it’s just become a culture war party. “Joyce is intimating that it’s a changed party and more palatable to middle Australia. I would say no, it isn’t, because it’s no longer making an economic argument.”",News/Australia news,Barnaby Joyce says One Nation has changed.

5/11/2022,"As millions of Indonesians travelled to their hometowns to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, one common struggle was being discussed in most family gatherings: the price of cooking oil. “I always host Eid al-Fitr celebrations for my big family. I cook everything for around 20 of us. But this year is the first time I had to ask them to chip in because everything is so expensive, especially the oil, and I really can’t handle it on my own,” Ellifa Kartini said. Palm oil is the most widely used cooking oil in Indonesia. Like many people, Kartini uses it for her family and for her business. She has run a small catering firm from her home in Bekasi, West Java, for 25 years. She also produces and sells traditional cookies. But the rising cost of cooking oil has been extremely difficult for her business. “Eid al-Fitr is that time of the year when I get the most orders and the biggest revenue. I could produce more than 25kg of fried cookies just for Eid al-Fitr. But this year I decided not to take any orders because the price is just too expensive. And if I raise my cookie price, I know my customers will not want to buy it,” she said. Ellifa said she needs around six litres of cooking oil each week for her business. On normal days it costs around Rp 15,000 ($US1.04) per litre, but for the past few months the price has kept rising , up to Rp 30,000 per litre. “Before it went up that much, it first disappeared from stores and markets. I have to queue up for hours just to get one litre. Sometimes I even have to go to another district to find it. But when it reached Rp 30,000 per litre I just gave up. The price just doesn’t make sense anymore,” she said. Mohammad Faisal, Indonesia executive director at the Centre of Reform on Economics (CORE) said there are two main reasons for the jump in prices: the impact of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Indonesia is the world’s largest producer of palm oil. Faisal said last year the country saw a spike in Covid cases and this affected the supply of palm oil. Producers were unable to meet levels of demand as Covid impacted workforces and disrupted output. Separately, supplies of another popular cooking oil – sunflower – have been strained after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Both Russia and Ukraine are among the world’s main exporters of sunflower oil. In an attempt to boost supplies in Indonesia, president Joko Widodo said from 28 April the government would ban the export of cooking oil and its raw materials . He said the policy was designed to ensure “abundant and affordable domestic cooking oil supplies”. Kartini has not noticed any change since the export ban and while she has seen many fluctuations in palm oil prices in the past, this is the worst one so far. “The price skyrocketed too high. But usually changes like this only last around a month, but this is the longest one. How many more months should we suffer?” she asked. According to Statistics Indonesia, the price of palm oil has been rising since October 2021 – and prices have not fallen since the export ban was imposed. In regions outside Java island, palm oil has become even more scarce. Yulian Juita, 32, who lives in Manggarai, East Nusa Tenggara said cooking oil has been disappearing for months. When it appeared, the price had doubled. “But I will buy it anyway, because we need it. I’m lucky because I only cook for my toddler and husband. But I try my best to be more frugal when using it,” she said. Juita said she usually uses around three litres a month, but now she tries to only use half that amount. In March, former president Megawati Soekarnoputri caused uproar when she criticised mothers for making so much fried food and said they should boil or steam instead. “Cooking oil is a very important part of our life, and you cannot underestimate this issue by forcing families to just boil everything instead of frying it. I’ve tried it, but it is not that simple. I have a three-year-old kid and his favourite food is fried fish. It’s challenging to only feed him boiled or steamed food,” Juita said. Some experts have criticised the government’s move to ban exports of cooking oil, saying it won’t help lower prices. “In theory, the ban on the export of cooking palm oil and imported raw materials will make domestic supply abundant,” said Rusli Abdullah, researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (Indef). “However, this does not guarantee that entrepreneurs will release their oil or raw materials when the prices are not attractive,” he said. CORE’s Faisal described the move as “hasty” and says the export ban may have wide-reaching repercussions. “The ban … has the potential to cause huge losses to industry players, many of whom could be not related to the cooking oil [ban],” he said. Kartini says she hopes cooking oil prices will come down soon, as her business is the main source of income for her family. “I hope it will end soon, I’m really afraid that it could affect my ability to pay for my children’s education if it keeps going. It’s really killing us,” she said.",News/World news,‘How many more months should we suffer?’: Indonesians struggle with pricey cooking oil,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/how-many-more-months-should-we-suffer-indonesians-struggle-with-pricey-cooking-oil
5/11/2022,"Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, said Vladimir Putin will “turn to more drastic means” to achieve his objectives in Ukraine. Haines told the Senate armed services committee that the Russian president was “preparing for prolonged conflict” in Ukraine and that his strategic goals have “probably not changed”. Haines also said Putin would continue to brandish Russia’s nuclear arsenal in an attempt to deter the US and its allies from further support for Ukraine. Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles. One person was killed and five were wounded after seven Russian missiles hit a shopping centre and depot on Monday, the military said. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address that Ukrainian forces have retaken villages in the Kharkiv region, which could signal a new phase in the war. But he also cautioned against expecting “certain victories”. Settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske were retaken from Russian forces. Belarus will deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine in response to a “growing threat” by the US and its allies, the armed forces said. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said Moscow had agreed to help Minsk produce missiles to beef up its military capabilities. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country said. The official UN civilian death toll in Ukraine stands at 3,381, as well as 3,680 injured. At least 100 civilians remain in Azovstal steelworks under heavy Russian fire in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor has said. Russian forces have not reduced the intensity of their attacks on the plant, where civilians and the city’s last Ukrainian defenders are holed up, Petro Andryushchenko said. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will visit Finland and Sweden on Wednesday, as the two Nordic countries consider whether to apply for Nato membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Downing Street said Johnson would have discussions on “broader security issues” during his visit to Finland followed by Sweden. Ukrainian officials said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building in the north-east of the country that was destroyed weeks ago. The bodies were found in a five-storey building that collapsed in March in Izium, about 120km (75 miles) from the city of Kharkiv. US lawmakers in the House of Representatives are expected to vote on Tuesday evening on a $40bn aid package for Ukraine. The legislation will then go to the US Senate, where sufficient support is not quite yet in the bag. However, there is broad bipartisan support for firm US backing of Ukraine after the invasion by Russia in late February. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, visited areas around Kyiv devastated by the war on a surprise visit to Ukraine. Baerbock said Ukraine should become a full member of the European Union at some point but that there could be no shortcut to membership. France’s Europe minister has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, spoke in a call on Tuesday. The two heads of state “reiterated their commitment to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” the Élysée said. Chinese state media said Xi warned Macron that confrontation between blocs resulting from the Ukraine crisis could become a bigger and more lasting threat to global peace than the crisis itself. Russia has been blamed for a massive cyber-attack against a satellite internet network an hour before Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The digital attack on Viasat’s KA-SAT network in late February took thousands of modems offline and helped facilitate Putin’s invasion of the country, the Council of the EU said.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 77 of Russia’s invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-77-of-russias-invasion
5/11/2022,"A senior cleric who fought an epic three-and-a-half-year battle over efforts to oust him as head of Christ Church, Oxford, has announced he is quitting the Church of England. Martyn Percy, the dean of Christ Church Cathedral as well as head of one of Oxford’s most venerable colleges, left his position last month after reaching a settlement involving a substantial payoff. He revealed in an interview in the Times last weekend that he had a serious breakdown during the prolonged dispute and came close to considering suicide. He criticised the bishop of Oxford for “writing a very public letter … saying that it was inappropriate for people to be defending me in public when I was being attacked in public”. Now he has announced his decision to leave the C of E in an article for Prospect magazine, citing the “parlous state of safeguarding” within the church. “In the face of … partisanship, failure to neutrally manage conflicts of interest, double standards and incompetence in the C of E’s safeguarding, I finally took a decision: to leave the church,” he said. “Though I have been ordained for more than 30 years, and continue with my faith in God, the Church of England has destroyed any trust I might have had in it. It is an unsafe place to work.” His experience of being accused of safeguarding failures and a charge of sexual harassment led him to conclude that the C of E “lacks transparency, accountability, external scrutiny and, as far as I am concerned, integrity”. Within the church, there was a “culture of bullying and harassment afflicting many clergy”, he said. The C of E was spending tens of millions of pounds a year on safeguarding, “most of which is frittered away on procedures that seem cosmetically adequate, yet ultimately lack the professional standards one would find in other spheres”. The protracted dispute between Percy and the governing body of Christ Church cost millions of pounds and caused serious reputational damage to the 476-year-old college, which has produced 13 British prime ministers and 17 archbishops. At the heart of the dispute was Percy’s pay and his efforts to reform the college’s governance, but he was accused of behaviour of an “immoral, scandalous or disgraceful nature”. In June 2019, all complaints against Percy were dismissed by a retired high court judge, and his reinstatement ordered. However, efforts by the governing body to remove Percy from his post continued. In February this year, the college agreed to pay a “substantial” sum to Percy and reimburse his legal costs. It also agreed to an independent review of its governance. A spokesperson for Steven Croft, the bishop of Oxford, said he had gone to “considerable lengths to care for Martyn Percy”, adding: “This has been a complex and painful process for all concerned over the past two years, much of which has been inaccurately played out by supporters of Dr Percy in the media and online.” The diocese had commissioned an independent review to be led by the C of E independent safeguarding board.

5/11/2022,"An Adidas campaign featuring dozens of sets of breasts to promote the diversity of its range of sports bras has been banned by the UK advertising watchdog for using explicit nudity and appearing where children could see the ads. The campaign, versions of which ran on Twitter and select large poster sites, prompted 24 complaints to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) that the ads were gratuitous, objectified women by “sexualising them and reducing them to body parts”, were harmful and offensive and were able to be seen by children. Adidas UK defended the images, saying they were not gratuitous or sexual but were intended to “reflect and celebrate different shapes and sizes and illustrate diversity”. The sportswear company said the images had been cropped to protect the identity of the models, and that they had all volunteered and were supportive of the campaign’s aims. Adidas added that it had not run the ads on posters or billboards near schools or religious venues, and did not think the campaign would cause harm or distress to children. The ASA said the depiction of naked breasts, including in one ad where pixellation was used to blur the nipples of the models, was “likely to be seen as explicit nudity”. “We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text,” the ASA said. “As the ads contained explicit nudity, we considered that they required careful targeting to avoid causing offence to those who viewed them.” The ASA said the large poster sites were not targeted and could be seen by people of all ages, including children, and the ads were therefore likely to cause widespread offence. The use of the ad on the Adidas Twitter feed was not in keeping with the usual content posted, the ASA said, and also likely to offend. “The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of,” ruled the ASA. “We told Adidas UK to ensure their ads did not cause offence and were targeted responsibly.” ",News/Media,Adidas sports bra ads banned in UK for objectifying women,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/11/adidas-sports-bra-ads-banned-uk-twitter-asa
5/11/2022,"Ministers’ threats to send unauthorised migrants to Rwanda are having a detrimental impact on the physical and psychological health of people seeking asylum, according to two major refugee charities. The British Red Cross and the Refugee Council, which worked with nearly 44,000 people in the asylum process, warn that they are disappearing from hotels and are reluctant to claim support for fear of deportation, detention and other harsh measures. The development comes as the Home Office admitted that LGBTQ+ refugees could be persecuted if sent to Rwanda – but still plans to fly them 4,000 miles to the capital, Kigali. The Home Office’s human rights assessment itself was also questioned on Tuesday, with the chief inspector of immigration asking for it to be independently scrutinised. The non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch has described it as full of “blatant falsehoods”. Mike Adamson, chief executive at the British Red Cross, said: “We are hearing directly from many people seeking asylum of the distress and anxiety recent announcements have provoked. People are telling us that they feel less safe and less welcome in the UK. “It’s therefore unsurprising that people’s psychological safety and sense that they are welcome has been eroded, and that people [are] considering going underground leaving themselves without formal support and in very vulnerable positions.” Those supported by the Red Cross include: A Rwandan asylum seeker who contacted the Red Cross in south-east England fearing he could be sent back to the country. He disclosed that he would be in hiding and refraining from accessing support so he is not identified by the authorities. An Afghan man living in temporary accommodation in the east Midlands who disclosed that he had gone into hiding, fearing that he would be detained and sent to Rwanda. He said that many of his friends were in the same situation and planned to go underground. An asylum seeker from Ethiopia based in the West Midlands said that he feels anxious about the passing of the Nationality and Borders Act and disclosed he had left his accommodation out of fear that he will be sent to Rwanda. An Afghan asylum seeker also based in the West Midlands who said he feels he is a second-class refugee as he is not eligible for recent schemes designed to support Ukrainians. Enver Solomon, chief executive at the Refugee Council, said: “We are hearing tragic stories about the severe impact on mental health, including young, vulnerable children who are terrified what will happen to them, with reports of self-harm. We are concerned the government is not seeing the face behind the case and should be doing far more to exercise its duty of care towards vulnerable people.” It comes the day after the Home Office said the first group of people would be informed this week of the government’s intention to relocate them to Rwanda. The first flights are expected to take place in the coming months, it said, adding that lawyers for some of those affected were likely to launch proceedings to stop their removal. The equality impact assessment released on Monday said there were “concerns over the treatment of some LGBTQI+ people but we will continue to consider the impact on this group and take into account further evidence over the course of the partnership”. The report noted that homosexuality was decriminalised in Rwanda in 2010, but warned: “At this stage, investigations point to ill treatment being more than one-off.” The government’s assessment of Rwanda’s human rights record stated that there were “not substantial grounds” for believing people would be at risk of treatment contrary to article 3 (freedom from torture and inhuman or degrading treatment) of the European convention of human rights in Rwanda. But Lewis Mudge, central Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said the risk assessment was unrealistic. “The Home Office’s report reads like some serious wishful thinking,” he said. “They seem to change the facts in order to justify a preordained conclusion, from claiming that refugees are not targeted for exercising their freedom of expression – when Congolese refugees rot in jail for protesting their living conditions – to claiming that LGBT people won’t risk serious harm in Rwanda – when evidence we have collected has LGBTI people detained, beaten, insulted and harassed for their sexual identity.”",News/World news,Threat of being sent to Rwanda ‘harming health of UK asylum seekers’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/threat-of-being-sent-to-rwanda-harming-health-of-uk-asylum-seekers
5/11/2022,"How migrating animals like sea turtles navigate hundreds to thousands of kilometres across the open ocean has intrigued biologists since Charles Darwin. But some sea turtles might not really know where they’re going, new research suggests. Analysis by an international team of scientists has mapped the movements of hawksbill turtles as they swam from their nesting grounds in the Chagos Archipelago to foraging sites also in the Indian Ocean. It found the turtles often travelled in circuitous routes when migrating short distances, suggesting the animals’ navigational sense is relatively crude while in the open ocean. The turtles typically travelled twice the required distance to their target locations. One individual swam 1,306km to reach an island that was a mere 176km away – travelling more than seven times the beeline distance. The team tagged and tracked via satellite 22 hawksbill turtles after they had finished nesting. Generally, sea turtles do not forage and nest in the same geographical area. These animals would have already undergone a migration from their foraging grounds, a mating season, and have laid multiple clutches of eggs before preparing for the return trip. Chair in marine science at Deakin University and the study’s first author, Prof Graeme Hays, said if the turtles were perfect navigators, they would probably travel in direct paths from their nesting sites to foraging areas in search for food. “Those turtles that we’re tracking – they most probably hadn’t eaten for four or five months,” he said. Previous research has suggested that turtles likely imprint on the magnetic field of their birth area – where they later return to lay eggs – and detect changes in the Earth’s magnetic field as a means of navigating through the ocean. Hays said the new study suggested the turtles “almost certainly are using a geomagnetic map, but it’s a fairly coarse resolution”. “So it doesn’t allow pinpoint straight-line migration, but it does tell them when they’re getting a long way off route,” he said. Hawksbill turtles typically migrate distances of about 150km, a modest distance compared with the migration of green turtles, Hays said. “For green turtles that nest in the Chagos Archipelago … we’ve tracked them going almost 5,000km to their foraging grounds,” he said. “They’ll swim all the way across the Indian Ocean to the mainland African coast. “Although it’s a long journey, in a sense it’s actually quite an easy navigational task because all the turtle has to do is swim vaguely westwards and it’ll eventually hit Africa.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Though hawksbill turtles were making far shorter migrations in comparison, they had the tricky navigational task of locating small, specific places like remote isolated islands or submerged banks. The new research suggests the turtles’ geomagnetic map sense is not fine-grained enough to locate specific targets. When closer to their intended locations, the animals likely use other navigational cues including sense of smell and visual landmarks, Hays said. “In the final stages, they can smell an island that they’re headed to.” “As they get some sort of visual landmark, for example, the water starts to get a bit shallower and they can see the seabed, then they probably got some sort of cognitive map of that area. They could probably just recognise the seafloor, just like you would recognise visual landmarks in the area where you live.” The research, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.",News/World news,"Migrating turtles don’t really know where they’re going, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/migrating-turtles-dont-really-know-where-theyre-going-study-shows

5/11/2022,"By the end, Alisson was trying to waste time. Sadio Mané was listlessly dribbling the ball into the corner in an attempt to burn away a few more seconds. Deep into injury time Naby Keïta started rolling around on the turf in apparent agony. Was it a cruciate? A broken leg? A debilitating muscle tear that would put him out for the season? Happily, as a victorious Keïta disappeared into the embrace of his teammates just a few seconds later, we have to conclude that he may just survive the night. Curiously, given his famously forthright views on teams adopting cynical tactics in an attempt to win games, Jürgen Klopp had very little to say about any of this afterwards. But then, perhaps it was understandable that aesthetics would be the last thing on his mind at Villa Park. This was the sort of win you have to extract like one of your own teeth, the sort of win that almost feels too debasing to truly celebrate, the sort of win you pull out on the day your title rivals sign Erling Haaland for next season. But it was a quietly crucial win too, for no other reason than because there was no real alternative. Liverpool know deep down that they will probably finish second in this year’s Premier League, and more painfully they know they probably deserve to. Those seven dropped points over Christmas and new year, an entire month without a league win, have likely done for them. Hope is the most precious commodity of all to retain at a time like this. But there are two major finals still to be played and this is no time to start feeling sorry for themselves, as it briefly appeared as if they might. You could even see the fatigue and lethargy in Klopp’s face as he did his post-match interviews: a coach of boundless energy whose tank looks like it has almost run dry. More than ever you sense Liverpool are trying to ration their efforts, spread their resources, chug gamely towards the end of a season that will encompass 63 games in all competitions. The omissions of Andy Robertson, Mohamed Salah and Thiago Alcântara from the starting lineup appeared telling. The injury to Fabinho, who limped off before half-time with a hamstring injury, will stretch them still further. And so, in a strange and scruffy game, disarmingly open in parts, Liverpool were forced to rely on their unlikelier stalwarts. Kostas Tsimikas had a wildly eclectic game at left-back, a juddering high-wire act that generated several misplaced passes, at least two clear positional errors and some crucial tackles and blocks. But his electric surges up the left flank, his willingness to ping the early cross, his restless sense of dramatic tension, were exactly what a tired Liverpool required here after the ice bath of going an early goal down. What was most notable about Douglas Luiz’s third-minute finish was that there were probably about five or six individual duels that led to it – crosses that could have been stopped, tackles or headers that could have been won – and Liverpool lost them all. Villa were lavish in those opening minutes, even after Joël Matip bundled home a quick equaliser, and so what Liverpool really needed was someone who could break the game up, upset Villa’s rhythm and impose one of his own. What they needed, above all, was Keïta. Those of you who may not have been watching too closely probably wrote Keïta off as damaged goods some years ago: probably during one of the many injury layoffs that threatened to curtail his Liverpool career before it had really begun. Even when Keïta managed to work his way to full fitness he found opportunities hard to come by in a midfield increasingly shaped by the metronomic Fabinho and Thiago, a midfield more concerned with controlling games rather than rattling them open. The problem was, in a way, that Keïta was signed to play in a Liverpool midfield that no longer existed. At RB Leipzig, where he played until 2018, he was an expansive, marauding presence, as comfortable dribbling the ball 50 yards through the centre as burgling goals with late runs into the penalty area. The problem was that by the time Keïta arrived, there was no longer much call for any of that. Liverpool were already beginning to pivot away from the sort of concussive, vertical midfield play that he was best at. And yet, four years into his time at Anfield, Keïta is quietly having his best season at the club so far: most appearances, most goals, a pivotal role in Liverpool’s run to the Champions League final. To a large extent this is a question of timing and fitness. But there also seems to be a recognition from Klopp that there are certain games where Liverpool need a little extra unpredictability in the middle: the snapping tackle, the enterprising dribble, the quick 50-yard long ball into space. Keïta is the man you call on when you’re worried things are just getting a little tired, a little stale. So it was fitting that he came to the fore on Tuesday night, in a game where Liverpool were in danger of submitting to their own languor. The limbs are screaming with tiredness, the minds are cooked, there’s a cup final on Saturday and effectively three more after that. Depleted, disheartened, but somehow still fighting: in a way, the story of Keïta is also the story of Liverpool’s season.",Sport/Football,Resurgent Naby Keïta keeps Liverpool going when the limbs are screaming | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/10/resurgent-naby-keita-keeps-liverpool-going-when-the-limbs-are-screaming

The winning numbers were 3, 25, 27, 28 and 29, plus the Lucky Star numbers 4 and 9. One ticket matched all seven numbers to win a total of £184,262,899.10 in prize money.

5/11/2022,"Jürgen Klopp said he has invited his Liverpool players to follow his lead in shutting out the noise surrounding their title scrap with Manchester City and insists his team are “still chasing like mad” after returning to winning ways at Aston Villa. Sadio Mané’s clever winner cut City’s advantage to just goal difference before they visit Wolves on Wednesday, and Klopp conceded the leaders have signed a “beast” in Erling Haaland. Asked how easy it is for Liverpool not to concern themselves about City, Klopp replied: “For me it is absolutely no problem. I have invited the boys to follow my mindset. We are still chasing like mad. We just know we have to win and now we have to recover and then to play the FA Cup final [on Saturday] because there is no mercy nowhere because of this situation [where we are] qualifying for all finals. We play an incredibly big game and from Thursday on we will prepare.” Douglas Luiz scored early for Villa but Liverpool hit back three minutes later through Joel Matip before Mané’s clever header from Luis Diaz’s cross midway through the second half secured victory. Klopp praised the mentality of his players and Alisson for making a world-class save to deny Danny Ings an equaliser. The manager confirmed Andy Robertson is rested for the final against Chelsea on Saturday, while Fabinho is a doubt after being forced off with a muscle problem. When asked how much stronger Haaland will make City following his £51m move from Borussia Dortmund, Klopp could not help but smile. “A lot,” he said. “City was and will never be a team that wins games because of one player, because of the way the specific way they play. I think Erling will certainly score a lot of goals. He is a real beast. He was injured a couple of times at Dortmund but when he is fit he is a real beast. Unfortunately, he is a really good signing.” The Villa manager and former Liverpool captain, Steven Gerrard, conceded Ings would play missed chances “over in his head on the way home” but was delighted with his side’s display. “We’re slightly frustrated we didn’t score more than once,” said Gerrard, who reiterated his intention to sign Philippe Coutinho on a permanent deal from Barcelona. “We’ve got to take those big moments we created. The big positives for me is that we were brave, courageous and went toe-to-toe with one of the best teams in the world. We knew at times we would have to suffer.”",Sport/Football,Jürgen Klopp says Liverpool ‘still chasing like mad’ for Premier League,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/jurgen-klopp-says-liverpool-still-chasing-like-mad-for-premier-league
5/11/2022,"Brendon McCullum, the pioneering former New Zealand captain, has emerged as the favourite to become England’s Test head coach with an announcement on the successful candidate due this week. Rob Key, the director of England men’s cricket, is looking to recruit separate coaches for the Test and white-ball sides, with McCullum among those known to have been first sounded out and then interviewed during the past couple of days. It was widely believed the 40-year-old McCullum’s application would relate to the limited-overs vacancy, given a nascent coaching career spent exclusively in franchise T20 cricket and a close friendship with Eoin Morgan, England’s white-ball captain. But there is now a growing expectation that McCullum may take charge of the Test set-up in a move that would combine his aggressive outlook with the captaincy of Ben Stokes, with a first assignment against New Zealand at Lord’s on 2 June. If so it would mean Gary Kirsten missing out of the role once more, having been runner-up when Chris Silverwood was hired in 2019. That said, the former South Africa and India head coach has a strong reputation for augmenting sides with existing depth and so could yet secure the equivalent position with the white-ball set-up. Paul Collingwood, currently an assistant coach with England, is another being considered for the limited-overs role while the former Australia batsman Simon Katich has similarly been part of a recruitment process that began when Key took charge of the men’s national teams at the start of last month. Appointing McCullum for the Test team would be a bold move by Key and one that will invite questions about the domestic coaching landscape in England, not least since the former wicketkeeper-batter has never coached a first-class side himself. McCullum is, however, widely credited for changing the culture of New Zealand’s Test team as captain between 2013 and 2016 and laying the foundation for the World Test Championship title last year under his successor, Kane Williamson. McCullum is coaching Kolkata Knightriders in the Indian Premier League but Key has said previously he is open to England’s head coach having a second job in the world’s most lucrative T20 tournament if it secures the right candidate.",Sport/Sport,Brendon McCullum favourite to become England’s Test head coach ,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/brendon-mccullum-favourite-to-become-englands-test-head-coach
5/11/2022,"The family sifts through childhood photos and marvels at the happiness. “Carefree … Look at your little tummies,” says his mother. His father feels the need to put them away. “So much waste. So much joy, so much potential … Such a waste that he’s gone now.” They are the parents of the singer Will Young, who found fame in 2002 as the charming and worthy winner of Pop Idol, and his twin, Rupert. They are looking through photos of the boys as part of a moving documentary about Rupert, who killed himself last year after enduring anxiety, depression and alcoholism for more than 20 years. Will Young: Losing My Twin Rupert (Channel 4) is a rare beast: a celebrity documentary that has an articulate subject, an affecting story and a sense of mission. Often, films in this genre induce an uncomfortable sense that the makers are exploiting grief, or that the celebrity is in need of cash or a kind person to tell them that some pain is best worked through behind closed doors. For various reasons, the Youngs have taken the decision to speak out and to try to help others dealing with the terrible effects of alcoholism. “I’d like to know the moment it went wrong, as we go through his life,” says the twins’ father, quietly, beside the dining table strewn with photos. The programme suggests possibilities – foremost among them the boys’ traumatic experiences at boarding school, of which the parents knew nothing for years – but there can be no definitive answers. We learn that Rupert’s suicide attempts began at 18 – “cries for help,” says Will. There are accounts of late-night calls from police, cleaning sofas Rupert urinated on while blacked out, paying for repeated rehab stays, brief flares of hope in sober stretches, despair as he declined again and again. By the end, he was living in his twin’s house, with Will as his carer. Will cleaned up the sick every morning and helped Rupert go to the toilet, not knowing “what more I could do”. Rupert would knock on neighbours’ doors asking for money and pass out outside the newsagent. Eventually, the police came knocking with the news that Rupert had killed himself. The film does not take the easy, reductive path of comparing the brothers’ lives. Instead, their stories are supplemented by candid, dignified interviews with others who have experienced alcoholism. These are conducted beautifully by Will; his self-effacing manner allows them plenty of space, while he brings in his own travails only when pertinent and supportive. Melissa Rice is four years sober and works to get others the help that saved her after six years of hard drinking that “piled shame on top of shame”. She can’t forgive herself for what she put her mother through. “There weren’t really that many times when I resented [Rupert],” Will tells her. “Now, I’m just grateful I had 42 years with him.” Their conversation seems genuinely to help both parties. It is the same when Will meets Natalie Needham, the organiser of the lockdown art-therapy project Stitch Away the Stigma. The last time she saw her alcoholic father was when she had him arrested and removed from her grandma’s house, effectively making him homeless. “The last thing I did was hit my brother,” Will reassures her. “I don’t have a problem with it. He deserved it.” Losing My Twin Rupert also includes what feels like an increasingly necessary reference in medical programmes to the enormous difficulty in accessing professional help and care. Young is explicit about having been able to pay for Rupert’s many private rehab visits – and the inability of most of Britain’s estimated 1.6 million alcoholics and their loved ones to do so. The academic and practising psychiatrist Prof Julia Sinclair is explicit about the barriers to state-funded care (“Many things in the system are now broken”), noting that there are just five inpatient units left in the country, meaning desperate people are left searching for answers in ever-contracting circles. This film is an unflinching portrait of 20 years of sadness that acknowledges the complexity around addiction with compassion and courage. Almost all such endeavours claim to want to reduce stigma.

5/11/2022,"Apple has discontinued the iPod more than 20 years after it was launched. The most recent iteration of the music player, the iPod Touch, has not been updated since 2019, and many of its features are now available on other products. Apple said it would continue to sell the Touch, the only generation of the iPod still on sale, “while supplies last”. The iPod was released in 2001, and was the first MP3 player capable of storing 1,000 songs. Aside from the Touch, versions included the iPod mini, iPod Nano, and iPod Shuffle. By 2011, Apple held a 70% global market share in MP3 players, and to date more than 400m iPods have been sold. The company stopped selling the Nano and Shuffle, its last standalone music players, in 2017, and industry experts had long predicted the Touch would follow given the prevalence of the iPhone and other smartphones that can be used to listen to music. Later versions of the Touch increasingly resembled smartphones, allowing users to take photos, send emails and make video calls. In a statement announcing the discontinuation, Greg Joswiak, Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, said the “spirit of iPod lives on”. “Music has always been part of our core at Apple, and bringing it to hundreds of millions of users in the way iPod did impacted more than just the music industry – it also redefined how music is discovered, listened to, and shared,” he said.",News/Technology,‘The spirit lives on’: Apple to discontinue the iPod after 21 years,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/the-spirit-lives-on-apple-to-discontinue-the-ipod-after-21-years

In a post on Monday, James, who has terminal bowel cancer, told followers on social media that she did not know “how long I’ve got left”. The presenter of the BBC podcast You, Me and the Big C said the last six months had been “heartbreaking” to go through, but that she had been surrounded by “so much love” and had “no regrets”. The former deputy headteacher said she was setting up the Bowelbabe Fund, and shared links to charities including Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity. The JustGiving page had raised more than £2m by Tuesday night. She told BBC Breakfast, in an interview due to be broadcast on Wednesday, that she feels “utterly loved” by the generosity. She said: “I had a figure in my mind of about a quarter of a million, because I thought that would be enough to fund a good couple of projects across the charities that I wanted to fund. “But in 24 hours to do a million, I’m like absolutely mindblown and I just cannot thank people enough for their generosity. It just means so much to me. It makes me feel utterly loved.” James was diagnosed with the condition in 2016 and since then has kept her nearly 300,000 Instagram followers up to date with her treatments, progress and diagnosis. On 14 December 2021, she marked five years since her diagnosis, writing on Instagram: “I’m fully aware I shouldn’t be alive to write this today.” But in her latest post, she said: “The message I never wanted to write. We have tried everything, but my body simply isn’t playing ball. “My active care has stopped and I am now moved to hospice at home care, with my incredible family all around me and the focus is on making sure I’m not in pain and spending time with them.” The post continued: “Nobody knows how long I’ve got left but I’m not able to walk, I’m sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams.” James added that she had left “no stone unturned” in search of treatment, but that even a “magic new breakthrough” would not make a difference.

5/11/2022,"As president, Donald Trump repeatedly asked aides if China could be manufacturing hurricanes and sending them to damage the United States, three unnamed former senior officials told Rolling Stone on Tuesday. Trump also reportedly wanted to know if using such a “hurricane gun” would constitute an act of war, and if so, whether the US could retaliate militarily. China is a major nuclear power. “It was almost too stupid for words,” one source told the magazine, which said the speaker was “intimately familiar with the then sitting president’s inquiry”. “I did not get the sense he was joking at all,” the source added. The news comes on the tail of former defense secretary Mark Esper’s claim, in a new book, that Trump wanted to hit “drug labs” in Mexico with missiles and then deny responsibility, and other hair-raising accounts of near foreign policy disaster. Rolling Stone quoted a second former official as saying: “I was present [once] when he asked if China ‘made’ hurricanes to send to us. [Trump] wanted to know if the technology existed. One guy in the room responded, ‘Not to the best of my knowledge, sir.’ “I kept it together until I got back to my office … I do not know where the [then-]president would have heard about that … He was asking about it around the time, maybe a little before, he asked people about nuking hurricanes.” In August 2019, the website Axios reported that in a briefing on hurricanes, Trump told top officials: “I got it. I got it. Why don’t we nuke them?” Trump was reportedly told that aides would “look into” the notion of destroying large storms with nuclear weapons, which in 2016 National Geographic called “a really bad idea” with “a surprising history”. Trump called the Axios story “ridiculous”. But his interest in hurricanes reared its head again the following week, in what would come to be known as “Sharpiegate”. At an Oval Office briefing on Hurricane Dorian, Trump held up a National Hurricane Center map that appeared to have been altered with a Sharpie pen, to show the storm hitting Alabama – a baseless claim previously made by Trump. Trump did not comment to Rolling Stone about its “hurricane gun” story. Stephanie Grisham, his press secretary at the time of Sharpiegate and his reported remark about “nuking” hurricanes, told the magazine she did not hear conversation about China making hurricanes, but it would not have surprised her if she had. “Stuff like that was not unusual for him,” Grisham said. “He would blurt out crazy things all the time, and tell aides to look into it or do something about it.” “His staff would say they’d look into, knowing that more often than not, he’d forget about it quickly – much like a toddler.”",News/US news,"Trump inquired if China could make hurricanes to harm US, ex-officials say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/donald-trump-china-hurricanes
5/11/2022,"Frank Lampard believes keeping Everton in the Premier League would be bigger than winning the title as a player given the stakes involved, and admits his managerial reputation has been on the line since he replaced Rafael Benítez in January. Lampard has become so consumed by the challenge of securing Everton’s top-flight status, and avoiding the financial disaster of relegation, that he considers it more important than the three Premier League titles he won during a glittering career with Chelsea. Everton visit relegated Watford on Wednesday hoping to record back-to-back away wins for the first time this season and Lampard has urged his players to seize the opportunity. “When you live this experience of a relegation battle it so consumes you and you so want the right thing because you understand what the stakes are,” he said. “The stakes for this are bigger for me now than when I won the Premier League as a player because of what it means to the club. “You know the economics of it are greater as well, to a different degree, and you know what it means to the fans and the people who work here. There shouldn’t be any way, with four games to go and one point out of the relegation zone, that you think you are fine. We’ve got a big job to do still.” Everton have dragged themselves out of the relegation zone with a more resilient, pragmatic style in recent games and Lampard accepts his coaching ability was under scrutiny from the moment he arrived. “There are a lot of questions of everybody when you are in this position, and I came into it,” he said. “The players are questioned, the club is questioned, I’m questioned. It’s the cutting-edge part of the job in that position. I’m having an incredible experience – again, I am not talking like it is done, we are in it still – but I came here and people wanted to challenge me. “At Derby we had probably 60% possession, high press, and Chelsea 60-70% possession, high press. That was the way I set up as a coach. Then in the last three games we are working at 25-30% possession, organising the team, getting a result, seeing the reaction, and that’s been an incredible challenge in a good way.” Lampard, who expects to be without the influential defender Yerry Mina for the next three games because of a calf injury, admits he is glad he did not hold out for an easier job. “I possibly could have waited,” he said. “I could have sat on my arse and done the bins at home for another six months. That has actually seemed quite appealing a couple times in the last few months! But it’s how I’ve been all my career. You build up a thicker skin as you go along, and you get excited by challenges. “If I had been somewhere else waiting I wouldn’t be experiencing 3,300 fans perform like they did the other day [at Leicester], or coming to the training ground or turning up for the Chelsea game. The feeling of that, this club and understanding how big it is, and what it is on the line here, has been a really huge thing for me.”",Sport/Football,Keeping Everton in Premier League would top winning titles for Lampard,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/keeping-everton-in-premier-league-would-top-winning-titles-for-lampard
5/11/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has said his unpopular decision to cancel his squad’s day off allowed him to clear the air with his players after Chelsea’s disappointing 2-2 draw with Wolves. Chelsea are at risk of losing their place in the top four after a poor run and the mood did not improve when the players were told to report to the training ground last Sunday. However, Tuchel said he was not looking to punish his side for blowing a 2-0 lead against Wolves and was trying to raise spirits before the world champions visit Leeds on Wednesday evening. “We planned a free day but after the disappointment it was not to punish them,” the Chelsea manager said. “Maybe some felt it was a punishment. It wasn’t. It was not the moment for a free day; it is better to be together and talk about it. We did very light training, had a run together and discussed things. “I think most of them expected a 30-minute teamtalk and then to watch the game again. Once they understood why they were here I get the feeling most of them accepted it and even looked up for it because there was an Under-23 game at one o’clock and I think two-thirds of the team stayed and watched it. “Nobody was getting in their car and getting away as early as possible. They take their responsibility – that is what I love about the team. It’s not like they arrived here with closed faces.” Tuchel, who denied reports of a row with Marcos Alonso during half-time against Wolves, said the session helped Chelsea prepare for Leeds. “I also cancelled my free Sunday,” he said. “But this happens. If you want to be loved on a daily basis you should not become a football coach. Everybody was here and the reaction was very nice. We used the Sunday morning to go over it so we had the Monday free for training. We just cleared the air.” With Todd Boehly’s consortium close to completing its takeover of Chelsea, Tuchel suggested the sanctions on Roman Abramovich had dented his team’s edge and that the impending departures of Antonio Rüdiger and Andreas Christensen on free transfers to Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively had taken a toll. Chelsea, who face Liverpool in the FA Cup final on Saturday, are close to being under new ownership. It is expected Boehly’s consortium will keep Bruce Buck as chairman and Marina Granovskaia could remain at Chelsea, who face Liverpool in the FA Cup final on Saturday. Continuity could ease Chelsea’s transition. They are unable to sell or buy players and are behind when it comes to summer planning. “You need to be careful with long-term plans at Chelsea,” Tuchel said. “You can end up that it’s not your plan any more. So a long-term plan is two or three matches. It’s high-level sport. You need to love where you are. I can just say for me everything is here. That’s why I dig in. “There’s no other way. Things are a bit more uncomfortable and things are like since a long time now where you wish sometimes: ‘Can we not just have a positive message now for everybody?’ “If you don’t get it, you don’t get it. It’s like in a football match sometimes that you have to suffer, suffer, suffer. We have the feeling we get punished for not a lot. Even with results.

5/11/2022,"Jürgen Klopp had performed his triple fist pump in front of the travelling Liverpool support. The manager’s pulse was still racing but the emotion was elation now – perhaps a bit of relief – rather than high stress. And then, as he prepared to disappear off down the tunnel, he glimpsed his match-winner. Sadio Mané had operated largely on the fringes. The striker had flashed one header wide and seen another effort pulled back for offside against Luis Díaz. But on 65 minutes, Mané sensed his opportunity. And how he made it count. On current form, you can only keep him out for so long. It was Díaz up the left, teasing Tyrone Mings before crossing, but the goal that settled this high-octane game and thrilled the entire nation (only joking, Pep) was all about the movement and ingenuity of Mané. He ghosted into space before shaping his body to fashion the power in the header. Emiliano Martínez had no chance. Nor did Mané when Klopp got hold of him in the victory celebrations. There was a big bearhug before Klopp fixed him in a headlock, manhandling him playfully from the scene. Mané had seen a late effort cleared from in front of the line by Matty Cash but his eighth goal in 11 games proved the difference. Liverpool deserved the win that returns the pressure on to Manchester City ahead of the Premier League leaders’ visit to Wolves on Wednesday night, although it was not easy. They needed Alisson to make a few saves, including two to keep out Danny Ings. The first came after the Aston Villa forward had taken a heavy touch; the second on 84 minutes when Ings made ground to the right of goal, the angle tight. Villa were excellent for the opening half-hour. They scored early through Douglas Luiz and they hardly lay down thereafter. It was a night when Klopp rested Andy Robertson and used Jordan Henderson, Thiago Alcântara and Mohamed Salah only as substitutes. Liverpool had enough to get the job done, the win characterised by rising levels of control and, also, them digging in when needed. The only blot was the hamstring injury that forced off Fabinho midway through the first half. Henderson’s arrival for him coincided with Liverpool tightening their grip. Not that Villa were ever out of it on a night when the tempo rarely dropped and the referee, Jon Moss, struggled to keep up. He enraged the Villa fans throughout and there were times when it was difficult to predict his next decision. Would the Villa manager, Steven Gerrard, force a slip from his beloved Liverpool? After their home draw with Tottenham on Saturday, the away side could ill afford another one. Gerrard could be proud at how his team played, especially at the outset when they were quick and committed. And deserved their lead, which had Klopp stunned. It was Ollie Watkins who first got in around the back of the Liverpool defence, on to a high ball from Tyrone Mings and, when he cut inside and unloaded, Alisson had to make a smart save. Villa recycled and Douglas Luiz just seemed to want it more than his markers when he attacked Lucas Digne’s cross. Alisson pushed the effort out, without real conviction and, with players on the floor, including Konstantinos Tsimikas and Joël Matip, Douglas Luiz had a simple finish. Liverpool’s response was immediate and the equaliser followed more loose defending, Mings erring this time, getting a Trent Alexander-Arnold free-kick stuck under his studs. Matip challenged, Diogo Jota went in and the ball broke to Virgil van Dijk, who shot and watched Martínez throw out a hand. Matip was on hand to prod home and it was fair to say that the touchpaper had been lit. Villa brought a rare intensity and it rattled Liverpool, especially their defenders. Alisson shanked a clearance straight at Watkins and was fortunate to get away with it while Ings had to do better when he rose to meet a whipped John McGinn cross. It was not Ings’ night. Liverpool came to worry Villa with their interchanges and overloads up the flanks and they had chances before the interval, ending the period in the ascendancy. Mané flickered but the big chance was created by Díaz and Alexander-Arnold for Naby Keïta. Unmarked 10 yards out and centrally placed, he completely missed his kick. Curtis Jones also shot straight at Martínez. Gerrard and Klopp both sprinted for the tunnel at half-time, a neat reflection of the urgency of the contest, and it did not relent in the second half. Liverpool pressed and probed, Alexander-Arnold almost releasing Díaz with a lovely ball over the top. Moments earlier, Alexander-Arnold had bent a free-kick just past the angle of post and crossbar; after it, he whistled another one wide. Ings played in Watkins and Tsimikas had to be quick to get across but Liverpool were in control, threatening the next goal. It came when the 62nd-minute substitute Carney Chukwuemeka played Luiz into trouble and Thiago, also on by now, pounced. He won the ball and found Jota, who moved it to Díaz. Danger. Mané’s header was a beauty.",Sport/Football,Sadio Mané completes comeback at Aston Villa to keep Liverpool in title race,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/10/aston-villa-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
5/11/2022,"Good morning. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese will face off again in a third and final leaders’ debate tonight, just 10 days out from the election. Here’s hoping the pair will provide more clarity about their party’s policies, after the calamity of Sunday’s second debate. Material circulating on the Chinese language social media platform WeChat alleges Labor and the Greens will fund school programs to turn students gay, impose new taxes and destroy Chinese wealth. The well-produced posters designed for the digital platform carry no authorisation, but mostly support the Liberal party. With three million users across the country, including politicians and media, the network could play a pivotal role in determining who wins. Here’s what we know about how the campaign is playing out on the platform so far. The Australian Electoral Commission is “actively” investigating unauthorised political signs claiming independent candidates are affiliated with the Greens, and whether they breach laws that ban misleading voters after confirming they break electoral laws requiring authorisation. Meanwhile, the AEC asked social networks to remove a video from Pauline Hanson’s campaign that includes allegations of voter fraud in past federal elections, but not before it got at least 200,000 views. Guardian Australia reporter Antoun Issa goes through Hanson’s claims one at a time and checks the facts. Most prominent independent candidates say they would negotiate with either Labor or the Liberals in the event of a hung parliament, with many indicating they would support whichever party met their policy demands on climate and integrity. The two issues were repeatedly cited as the most commonly raised in the respective electorates of the dozen high-profile lower house independent candidates and sitting crossbench MPs questioned by Guardian Australia. Curious to know more? Read the full responses from independent candidates and crossbench MPs surveyed. Vladimir Putin could potentially use a nuclear weapon if he views the prospect of defeat in Ukraine as an existential threat to his regime, the top US intelligence official has warned. The grim forecast came on a day of continued fighting in the east and south of Ukraine, and Russian missile attacks on the port of Odesa, with the UN conceding that the civilian death toll from the war will probably be far higher than the current official estimate of 3,381. Coral bleaching affected more than 90% of reefs surveyed along the Great Barrier Reef this year according to a report, which revealed the extent of the sixth mass bleaching event. Ride-share and taxi drivers say the rising cost of petrol is putting them under enormous strain. Drivers say their costs have surged but fares have stayed flat, forcing them to be picky about the trips they choose. Domestic violence advocates and survivors have welcomed an inquiry into how Queensland police handle domestic violence, but are waiting for the detail to see if it will examine “widespread cultural issues” within the police service. Employers have warned that “small business can’t afford” the 5.1% minimum wage rise backed by Anthony Albanese to keep up with inflation. Employers argue that excessive minimum pay increases will fuel inflation, but unions say a 5.5% increase is “incredibly reasonable” to meet cost-of-living pressures. People in National party seats will be turned off by Bridget McKenzie’s characterisation of community independents as “Simon Holmes à Court’s groupies”, the former Indi independent Cathy McGowan has warned. The Spanish spy chief, Paz Esteban, has been sacked as the country tries to contain the fallout from a cyber-espionage scandal. Survivors of the brutal regime of the late Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos have described his son’s apparent landslide presidential election victory as the product of trickery and disinformation. Elon Musk has said he will reverse Twitter’s ban on Donald Trump if he completes a takeover of the social media platform. China’s zero-Covid policy is not sustainable “considering the behaviour of the virus”, according to the WHO. Natalie Bassingthwaighte’s latest TV project is, by her own description, a “heartwarming experiment” in which seven strangers see if increased creativity can help their mental health. Despite her years on stage, Bassingthwaighte didn’t grow up in a musical household – or so she thought. It wasn’t until she unearthed an old keyboard from her parent’s home that she learned her dad had once played music. She tells us why she’d rush to save that “crusty” old instrument in a fire. Australia relies on overseas-trained medical experts yet consigns them to professional purgatory, writes Ranjana Srivastava. “On my way to a conference, the taxi driver has taken an inordinate interest in my work until I am forced to reveal that I am an oncologist … it never crosses my mind that he might be a doctor himself. The disclosure [that he was a cancer surgeon before a taxi driver] makes me sink deeper into my seat to render myself invisible. He fled his country during war. When he turned his mind to medicine, the hurdles were onerous and the rules opaque.” An intimate new documentary explores the difficult life of David McComb of the Triffids, one of Australia’s most brilliant songwriters, whose unexpected death stunned the industry. Jonathan Alley began working on his biopic Love in Bright Landscapes 13 years ago. He wanted to celebrate McComb’s incendiary talent for words and music, but didn’t want it to be a standard rock documentary. “I wanted to make a biographical piece on an artist and what was happening in that person’s life, and why those things were happening,” he says. In Queensland, a big swing away from the Labor party in 2019 was a decisive factor in their defeat. However, the political landscape in some seats has shifted.

5/11/2022,"The Kentucky parents who have drawn criticism for running a marathon with their six-year-old son said that child protective services have since made an unannounced visit to their home to interview their children. Ben and Kami Crawford shared a photo of their youngest child, Rainier, purportedly being interviewed by a staffer from the state’s CPS department after an Instagram post detailing the boy’s at time arduous journey in completing the Flying Pig Marathon in Cincinnati earlier this month. “Yesterday Child Protective Services (CPS) arrived at our home unannounced and interviewed our children, parents & grandmother,” the family’s statement on Instagram read. “This is a scary process because usually children are interrogated away from parents, against their will, and their answers determine the agency’s legal right to take away the kids.” Campbell county district attorney Steve Franzen confirmed to ABC’s Good Morning America that Kentucky’s CPS visited the Crawford family, but said no ruling had been made yet in the investigation. The Crawfords, who run a website and YouTube channel, made headlines last week after sharing that Rainier ran the Flying Pig Marathon on 1 May, saying that “he was struggling physically and wanted to take a break and sit every three minutes” at mile 20. In an Instagram post on 3 May, the Crawfords said Rainier “was crying and we were moving slow” so he was promised two sleeves of Pringles if he kept going. “I had to promise him another sleeve to get him in the family pic at the finish line. Today I paid him off,” reads the Instagram post, showing Rainier holding the chips. According to the Crawfords, their five older children finished the race an hour ahead of them, while the parents and Rainier all crossed together at eight hours and 35 minutes. They have stood by their decision to run the marathon with their youngest son despite the vocal backlash from “an elite group of runners that are using their large platforms to police running for everyone, citing outdated research, and inbred rhetoric to stop others from enjoying it”. “The real stuff that we got accused of was dragging Rainier, like physically dragging him on the marathon course after mile 13 and across the finish line,” Ben Crawford said in a video posted on Saturday, defending the family against allegations of child abuse. “If you guys have seen our finish line picture, we all held hands for like the last probably, like, 0.2, 0.3 miles,” he added. “We talked about it ahead of time, like that’s what we’re going to do.” Crawford stated his son “had the option” to run and “begged” them to do so. “I don’t know if I should be angry,” he said. “I like to believe that people are doing the best that they can. They’re not trying to ruin our life or, you know, they probably are legit afraid for our kids. But also, it’s like, where’s the line?” Iris Simpson Bush, the executive director of the Flying Pig Marathon, took “full responsibility” for the decision to allow Rainier to run and called it “not the best course of action” in a statement issued last week.",Sport/Sport,Parents of six-year-old marathoner reveal child protective services visit,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/six-year-old-marathon-runner-kentucky
5/11/2022,"Vanuatu’s push for the international court of justice to protect vulnerable nations from climate change has received the backing of 1,500 civil society organisations from more than 130 countries, as it heads toward a crucial vote at the UN General Assembly later this year. In 2021 Vanuatu announced its intention to seek an advisory opinion by the international court of justice on the rights of present and future generations to be protected from climate change. If it succeeds, the ICJ’s advisory opinion - although non-binding - carries legal weight and moral authority which experts say could help shape international law. The opinion could also influence domestic and regional courts and tribunals when addressing issues relating to climate change. Vanuatu is trying to build support for its motion ahead of the UN General Assembly later this year, at which it needs to secure at least 97 votes, in order for the matter to be referred to the ICJ. The alliance, announced on Friday, represents more than 1,500 civil society organisations (CSOs) from across the globe, including preeminent climate groups from the Pacific: Climate Action Network - International, Greenpeace Australia Pacific, Oxfam in the Pacific, 350 Pacific, Pacific Islands Climate Action Network and Vanuatu Climate Action Network. An independent observer of Vanuatu’s campaign said the alliance could put pressure on other nations to support Vanuatu’s initiative. “It throws the weight of these CSOs behind the initiative, which will put pressure on other states to support the initiative. There have been similar proposals before, which have been driven by other Pacific countries, like Palau in 2011, which have been derailed by pressure from rich countries, such as the United States,” said Fleur Ramsay, a Pacific islander lawyer specialising in climate and environmental law with the Environmental Defenders Office. Vanuatu has engaged a Pacific law firm, Blue Ocean Law, to represent them in their campaign for the advisory opinion and has retained external counsel to assist with the development of the legal strategy, including lawyers from the UK, the US, France, Canada, Greece, India, Switzerland and Fiji. Joseph Sikulu, Pacific Director of 350.org said the alliance was an extension of the important advocacy Pacific island nations have been doing on climate change for many years. “The Pacific has already shown that governments and civil society can work together to achieve impactful change; the 1.5 degree benchmark being ingrained into the Paris Agreement is a testament to that. Through this alliance we hope to continue to weave together advocacy at all levels to build momentum behind the Vanuatu Government’s push for this Advisory Opinion.” Vanuatu is one of the countries most affected by the climate crisis, with a combination of climate risks that include sea level and temperature rises, as well as extreme weather events including cyclones, storm surges, landslides, flooding and droughts. It is also among Pacific nations at the forefront of the climate fight. Vanuatu has been a vocal proponent in limiting temperature rise from global warming to 1.5C. The Pacific nation launched an online data modelling tool to perceive and prepare for potential impacts of rising tides and storm surges. It is are also experimenting with crossbreed crop varieties to identify climate resilient crops including taro. Vanuatu ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016 and is one of 43 nations on the Climate Vulnerable Forum. In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2021, Vanuatu prime minister Bob Loughman said: “The dire consequences of climate change can no longer be ignored, and the science linking climate change to past and present emissions of greenhouse gases is now beyond question. Climate change is driving sea level rise, desertification, disease redistribution, floods, unprecedented ‘heat domes’, cyclones, hurricanes, and other extreme weather events.”",News/World news,Vanuatu’s push for legal protection from climate change wins crucial support,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/vanuatus-push-for-legal-protection-from-climate-change-wins-crucial-support
5/11/2022,"Finn Russell believes the jeopardy of relegation in the Top 14 is a key factor behind the success of the French clubs in the Champions Cup with Racing 92 one of three to reach the last four, which features no Premiership teams for the second year running. Russell scored a remarkable try in Racing’s victory over Sale last Sunday to ensure a rematch of last season’s semi-final against La Rochelle, on Sunday, while Leinster host Toulouse, the defending champions, in the other tie on Saturday. Sale’s defeat leaves no English clubs in the reckoning in a tournament that was won by a Premiership side for four of the five seasons before the current lean spell began. Racing’s side featured Russell, Teddy Thomas and Juan Imhoff while they were able to call on Virimi Vakatawa and the World Cup-winning prop Trevor Nyakane from the bench in a show of their strength in depth. While the salary cap in France has recently been reduced, it sits at around €10m (£8.5m), significantly more than the Premiership, which has been trimmed to £5m. Furthermore, there will be dispensation for one marquee player to sit outside the cap, rather than two, from next season. That has led to a number of high-profile players leaving the Premiership – Sale are losing the World Cup winners Faf de Klerk and Lood de Jager – and though the fact there is no relegation for this season, the next and possibly longer dilutes the need for such star power on a domestic front, it could be hurting the Premiership’s chances in Europe. “The number of players we have here in France and the recruitment we do, that helps a lot,” said Russell. “In the Premiership just now, there’s no relegation. Over here, teams are scrapping to stay out of that relegation battle – scrapping to stay up, or get into the Champions Cup. Mike Davis, the coach who guided England to a triumphant 1980 Six Nations grand slam, has died at the age of 80. Davis, who also won 16 caps for his country, was in charge of the national team for four years between 1979 and 1983 and was widely respected across the game. England had not won a grand slam since 1957 when Davis took over as head coach for the 1979-80 season but, under the captaincy of Bill Beaumont, his side clinched a famous clean sweep with a 30-18 victory over Scotland at Murrayfield. Overall Davis’s 20 Tests in charge yielded 10 wins and three draws. Davis played his club rugby for Torquay Athletic and Harlequins and made his international debut at lock against Wales in Cardiff in 1963. His played his final Test against Scotland in 1970 before becoming a popular, long-serving teacher at Sherborne School in Dorset. “There are never any easy games. Every game, you have to play your best to win. This year, we’ve lost to Biarritz and Perpignan, who are at the bottom of the league. We lost to both of them away from home. “That just shows that whether teams are high up or low down, every game is a massive game. Every week you are playing in a must-win game because if you drop two points, it puts you in a tough position. That’s the great thing for us. “I don’t really keep an eye on how the league is going in England. I just know that, over here, where there is relegation, teams are scrapping at the bottom because they want to stay in the Top 14. Whether they are at home or away, it makes games so much harder because teams are scrapping away to stay in the Top 14.” Russell also believes the success of the Top 14 sides on the continent goes hand in hand with the fortunes of the France national side, who clinched a first Six Nations grand slam in 12 years in March. “In general, French rugby is getting much better and it’s a country that loves rugby so with the clubs and the national team doing that, it gets more and more people into rugby. “It’s different – the Top 14 compared to the Premiership or the URC. The style of rugby changes from team to team, but also from competition to competition. In the Top 14 there’s physicality, there’s flair, there’s strategy; there’s everything you want here.”",Sport/Sport,Russell highlights relegation scrap as spark for Top 14 clubs’ success in Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/finn-russell-claims-relegation-threat-helps-strengthen-top-14-clubs-in-europe
5/11/2022,"Spoiler alert: this article includes details of the final episode of Life After Life. Do not read on unless you have watched the first three episodes. Groundhog Day stories are always tense. No one wants to spend their life reliving the same day over and over, whether it be Amazon Prime’s Palm Springs movie’s tale of waking up at a friend’s wedding every morning (please God, no) or endlessly replaying your birthday party, as in season one of Netflix’s Russian Doll, before Nadia’s time travel became a tad more freeform. These time-loop tales conjure intense discomfort, paranoia and irritation – you can’t help but go all existential and ponder: “What even is time? What the hell is life?” Life After Life is a period drama that pushes this time-loop narrative to the next level, in which the protagonist, Ursula Todd, relives her life again and again and again. While this concept has the potential to be one long exhausting slog (for the audience and Ursula), the series – which concludes its neat four-episode run on BBC Two tonight – has turned out to be one of the most beautifully told, thoughtful and underrated series of the year so far. Based on Kate Atkinson’s 2013 novel, it begins with Ursula’s birth in rural Buckinghamshire in 1910. Within seconds, she is strangled by her umbilical cord and dies. The screen is covered in snow-like white flecks to mark her death, and the story immediately rewinds to her birth – only this time, a doctor is there to save baby Ursula. She grows up to become a young girl, but when she goes swimming in the sea, those white flecks fall, and we are taken back to her birth. It quickly becomes clear that Ursula is both horribly accident-prone and downright unlucky. With each life iteration, she reaches different ages, but she always dies – the 1918 flu pandemic, falling out of a window, second world war bombings – and is reborn to start all over again. Unlike most other time-loop narratives, Ursula isn’t fully aware that she lives life after life. She isn’t tormented by her former lives. She’s also not trying to escape her life, or the loop she is unknowingly caught in. Instead, she lets a powerful sense of deja vu guide her into making different decisions that usually, but not always, lead to a happier and more learned place. The more times she lives, the better and bolder she is at it, and we are treated to a different story – a different woman! – in each one. Thomasin Mckenzie, who plays Ursula, is perfect at capturing this gradual change from meekly dreading life to brazenly embracing her gut feelings and taking new chances. Despite this, though, many of Ursula’s lives are miserable. In fact, with the knowledge that she will always get another chance to improve things, it sometimes comes as a relief when she dies. The hardest life to watch is the one in which Ursula is raped as a teenager and has a secret abortion. When her mother (Sian Clifford, wonderful in a genre we’ve not seen her in before) finds out, their relationship becomes permanently tainted with shame. Ursula moves to London, turns to drinking and ends up marrying a man who lies about his debts and abuses her. It’s hard to think of another period drama that unflinchingly shows the brutal realities of assault, abortion and domestic violence as powerfully and non-gratuitously – putting the focus on to something that too many women have died from, including Ursula. Her next life – in which she dodges those who previously assaulted her, and goes on to exercise her sexual freedom – provides great satisfaction. After already living around 10 lives, it’s actually comforting to see her live again. Of course, she soon dies. But the following lives after this see her apply to the University of Oxford, fall in love and have a child with a good man, learn how to shoot a gun … you name it, she’s done it. It’s also a hoot to see her befriend Izzie (Jessica Brown Findlay), the wild but loving and loyal aunt who parties in London and writes a column called Adventures of a Modern Spinster. In every life Ursula lives, their friendship remains.The one other constant in all her lives is the second world war, which much of the final episode concentrates on. This is when those existential questions creep in. “I don’t know why we live. All we do is die,” Ursula sobs before breathing her last under the rubble. “I just want a good death. How do you have a good death?” Why is any of this happening? Is she meant to prevent the war? Will she only be at peace with a happy death? Is she meant to save her brother Teddy, who keeps getting shot down? Is this all a dream? It’s clear there are no answers. No box-packaged ending explains it. There’s no riddle for Ursula to solve to stop the time-loop, no mission she’s meant to complete (she shoots Hitler in one life, but she dies at the same time, so we don’t know if she was successful or not – not that it matters, anyway, if she is born once again into a world in which Hitler exists). There is no “happy death”, either – otherwise she wouldn’t return even after she dies on a beach as an old woman. There is unexpected peace in this ambiguity. After the last scene, Ursula is still being born and dying, being born and dying, being born and dying. Far from being a frustrating story of someone stuck in a cycle, it’s a whole library of great stories that one person has the potential to live.

5/11/2022,"The actor Ann Davies, who has died aged 87, was a likable character player with a light touch who was a familiar face on the small screen – sometimes alongside her husband, Richard Briers. She was a gifted performer in her own right – diminutive with laughing eyes and cherubic features that lent themselves to comic characters, she proved equally capable of high drama. Television immortality came early on when when she joined forces with the first Doctor Who, William Hartnell, in 1964 in The Dalek Invasion of Earth. As Jenny, a determined and capable freedom fighter, Davies was a cold and efficient co-combatant with the series regular Barbara (Jacqueline Hill, in real life Davies’s friend and neighbour). The action required them to encounter the Daleks in arresting scenes filmed at London landmarks. At one point they smashed through a patrol with a van, which required early morning shooting in the capital to avoid the crowds. Although it was just one guest role in her long career, Davies remained in demand for Doctor Who interviews and signings. If Jenny had a harsh exterior that masked great vulnerability, then Dorothy Clarke in a 1996 adaptation of Minette Walters’ The Sculptress, starring Pauline Quirke, found Davies skilfully going the other way, misdirecting the audience with an unobtrusive, mousy persona which disguised the fact that she was the killer of the piece. Another favourite performance of hers was in Jill Hyem’s Equal Terms (1973), a two-hander in which she played a former psychiatric patient presenting a tricky case for Judy Parfitt’s novice social worker. Ann was born in Hornchurch, east London, the eldest child of Ronald Davies, a solicitor, and his wife, Sally (nee Simmonds), who worked as his secretary. Thanks to the second world war, her early education was peripatetic until she settled at the Queen’s school in Chester. Academically bright, she was encouraged by her parents and teachers towards university at Oxford or Cambridge, but her love for theatre led to her “running away to the circus” and she joined the Liverpool Playhouse as an acting stage manager aged 18. She was offered a place at Rada in London in 1956, but while at Liverpool had fallen in love with Briers after taking pity on the thin and hungry newcomer to the company and cooking him meals. They married within eight months and so she mastered her trade first at Liverpool and then in repertory at Coventry and Guildford, before making her London debut at the Arts theatre in 1959. She and Briers tried to work together where possible, including in Major Barbara (in which she was Jenny Hill, Belgrade theatre, 1958), Kenneth Branagh’s Renaissance theatre touring production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream (with Davies as the First Fairy, 1990-91) and in Simon Paisley Day’s Spike (Davies as the repressed wife, Nuffield theatre, Southampton, 2001), this time joined by their daughter Lucy and in which Davies was “perfectly cast” according to the Stage and “superb” in the opinion of the Telegraph. After her first small screen appearance in 1955, she was part of Britain’s televisual furniture for five decades, in popular drama – Z-Cars (four different roles between 1968 and 1973), Poldark (1976), Within These Walls (1975-78), Widows (1985), The Bill (three roles, 1993-96), EastEnders (1997), Grange Hill (1998-99), Doctors (2003) and Whitechapel (2013) – and comedy – Charley’s Aunt (1965), All in Good Faith (1988), After Henry (1990), and Keeping Up Appearances (1993). She was Bridget Bigwell in Alvin Rakoff’s 11-part production of John Mortimer’s Paradise Postponed (1986) and had great fun as Mrs Ripper opposite her husband’s Martin Bryce in Ever Decreasing Circles (1987-89). She also appeared in Branagh’s feature films Peter’s Friends (1992) and In the Bleak Midwinter (1995), and in the big-screen Run For Your Wife (2012). Dedicated to her family, she ensured that her daughters had the further education she had denied herself, though she later took an Open University degree. Briers died in 2013. She is survived by their daughters, Kate and Lucy, her siblings, Sally, Maggi and Richard, and two grandchildren, Harry and Rachael.

5/11/2022,"The Home Office has backed down part way through a high court hearing after an orphaned teenage asylum seeker from Eritrea feared she would be unable to sit her GCSE exams next week due to not being accommodated close to her college. During Tuesday’s hearing the department agreed to pay for travel until her exams finish next month – a sum of about £300. The ongoing court proceedings are likely to have already cost many thousands of pounds. Officials also guaranteed her a bedroom to herself so she can study in peace and quiet. The court was told the 18-year-old, who has been diagnosed with PTSD and fled her country in January 2021 to escape compulsory military conscription, experienced the trauma of witnessing sexual abuse while locked in a warehouse in Sudan. She could not attend Tuesday’s hearing because she was at school. A court order prevents her identification. She arrived in the UK in June 2021 on a small boat and was first accommodated in Kent. The Home Office then moved her to Bethnal Green in east London, where she built up a support network and started to study for GCSEs at a local college. But with almost no notice the Home Office first told her she was being moved to Hounslow in west London and then put her in a taxi with three men and sent her to Hemel Hempstead, a two-hour journey on public transport to her college. She began high court proceedings so she could return to her college and support network in east London. Four different high court judges have considered her case during the last few months. On 14 March the Home Office told the high court she would be moved back to Bethnal Green by 28 March, but this did not happen. A few weeks later on 21 April she was taken to an address there but when she arrived she had to wait outside for two hours as there was no mattress at the accommodation for her to sleep on. She was then taken away from that address and placed in her current accommodation. Her bedroom has space for two people but the Home Office has agreed not to move a second person in for the time being. She is struggling to pay for food and other essentials because it costs her £18 a week to travel to college, almost half of her weekly support payment of £40 from the Home Office. Her GCSEs are on a different site from her college further away from her accommodation and it will cost her more than £20 a week to travel there. The alternative is an eight-mile daily round trip on foot to her exams. In the course of the hearing Home Office officials contacted by phone agreed to immediately transfer a payment of £14.50 a week into the teenager’s account so she can pay for food and also travel to her exams. Benjamin Douglas-Jones QC, sitting as a deputy high court judge, said: “This particular claimant has endured a lot, particularly with the Hemel Hempstead fiasco.” He said that the way the teenager was moved around between two of the different accommodation sites “should not have happened”. The teenager’s solicitor – Jamie Bell, of Duncan Lewis solicitors – said: “It is truly absurd how hard our 18-year-old client has had to fight just to access the basic rights of education. We are delighted that she should now have the opportunity to take her GCSEs after her case had to be considered by four judges.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “Despite dealing with unprecedented pressures on the asylum system, we continue to provide safe, comfortable and secure accommodation for asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute. “Asylum accommodation is offered on a no-choice basis and we always aim to keep asylum seeker moves to a minimum. There are occasions however where such moves are necessary but, in such instances, asylum seekers are always given sufficient notice ahead of their move.”",News/UK news,Home Office backs down over travel costs for Eritrean refugee sitting GCSEs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/home-office-backs-down-over-travel-costs-for-eritrean-refugee-sitting-gcses
5/11/2022,"Federal agents and detectives from the Madison police department are investigating a claim by a pro-choice group that it was behind a weekend arson attack on an anti-abortion office in Wisconsin. The headquarters of Wisconsin Family Action in Madison was attacked in the early hours of Sunday, with a molotov cocktail thrown through a window, starting a small fire, and graffiti spray-painted on an exterior wall. Nobody was hurt. In a statement reported on Tuesday by the Lincoln Journal Star, which said it was unable to verify the group’s authenticity, Jane’s Revenge said it launched the attack because of the organization’s anti-abortion stance, and demanded that similar institutions across the US disband or face “increasingly extreme tactics”. “Wisconsin is the first flashpoint, but we are all over the US, and we will issue no further warnings,” the statement said, citing the violence of anti-choice groups who “bomb [abortion] clinics and assassinate doctors with impunity” as justification. The Madison attack came days after the leaking of a supreme court draft ruling that would overturn its 1973 Roe v Wade decision and end almost half a century of constitutional abortion protections. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) told the Guardian that its agents were aware of the group’s claims of responsibility, but cited the ongoing investigation for being unable to give more details. The Madison police department said it was “aware of a group claiming responsibility for the arson at Wisconsin Family Action and are working with our federal partners to determine the veracity of that claim”. It urged anyone with relevant information to make contact, saying: “We take all information and tips related to this case seriously and are working to vet each and every one.” At a press conference on Monday afternoon, the Madison PD and ATF agents announced a joint investigation into what it called an “abortion extremism case involving an arson and graffiti attack of a pro-life advocacy office in Madison”. The Madison police chief, Shon Barnes, said no suspects had so far been identified. Authorities were expected to give a further update on Tuesday afternoon. In a values statement on its website, Wisconsin Family Action (WFA) describes itself as a Judeo-Christian group dedicated to “strengthening, preserving, and promoting marriage, family, life and liberty. “We support the sanctity of human life from the moment of conception through natural death. This includes opposing legislation that promotes the destruction of human life – which starts at conception – through abortion and other means,” it says. Jack Hoogendyk, the WFA board chairman, attacked the response to the attack in a tweet posted on Tuesday morning, singling out Wisconsin’s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and Madison PD detectives. “We need to see a much stronger message of condemnation of this activity from our Governor [and] from local law enforcement,” he wrote. At a press conference on Monday, Evers called the attack “a horrible incident”. Calling for a full investigation and arrests, he added: “As the state of Wisconsin, we don’t accept that type of violence here.” An attack on an anti-abortion office is a relative rarity compared with attacks on abortion clinics and providers. In 2019, the Guardian reported on an “alarming escalation” in picketing, vandalism and trespassing by anti-abortion activists at medical facilities. Arson, bombings, murders and acid attacks were among more than 300 acts of extreme violence recorded by the Rand Corporation between 1973 and 2003, and in one of the most heinous incidents, in 2009, Dr George Tiller, a Kansas abortion provider, was shot dead in a church in Wichita. In March, MS magazine reported that the number of brick-and-mortar abortion clinics nationwide had dropped precipitously, partly because of the constant threat of violence against personnel. Six states, MS said, had only one abortion provider, mostly small, independent operators who were considered most at risk. “Abortion clinics have been closing at an alarming rate,” the article said. “Independent providers are the most vulnerable to anti-abortion attacks and violence directed at their staff.”",News/US news,Pro-choice group claims arson attack on Wisconsin anti-abortion office,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/abortion-arson-attack-wisconsin-pro-choice-janes-revenge
5/11/2022,"Boris Johnson was accused of being “bereft of ideas or purpose,” after a Queen’s speech that included 38 new bills but offered no specific measures to tackle the immediate cost of living crisis. Instead, the speech, delivered by the Prince of Wales amid the pomp of the state opening of parliament, included plans to tear up the Human Rights Act, make it harder for councils to rename streets and privatise Channel 4. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the speech showed the government had no guiding principle, while Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, was equally withering. “British politics is out of ideas,” he said. “Further action has been promised on the cost of living, but there certainly wasn’t any in the Queen’s speech. It rightly highlighted the need for growth – the essential precondition for ending our living standards stagnation – but did little to actually bring it about.” With the Queen unable to give the address for the first time in almost 60 years, Prince Charles began by saying: “My government’s priority is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for families”. However, Johnson’s programme for the new parliamentary session included a string of well-trailed and controversial plans, including banning disruptive protests and preventing universities from no-platforming speakers; but few new policies likely to boost the economy in the short term. Instead, the government emphasised help it had already provided, including the temporary energy bill rebate and the cut to the universal credit taper rate. Government sources claimed two-thirds of the planned new laws were aimed at boosting economic growth in the medium and long-term, pointing to the energy security bill, which aims to open up the market for new technologies such as hydrogen and carbon capture. Johnson said the country had “risen to challenges with no precedent in recent history” including the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine rollout, as well as Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, the UK’s supply of weapons to Kyiv and the sanctions regime that had been imposed. But he warned that “economic aftershocks” of global crises meant huge disruptions to the global economy. “No country is immune and no government can realistically shield everyone from the impact,” he said. Responding to the speech in the House of Commons, Starmer said the government had failed to respond to the scale of the looming “stagflation crisis”, while Conservative backbenchers David Davis and John Redwood called for tax cuts. Theresa May’s former chief of staff Gavin Barwell tweeted that there was “lots to like” in the Queen’s speech, including a ban on no-fault evictions once promised by May; but he criticised the “lack of action” on the cost of living, adding, “both morally and politically the government needs to do more.” Starmer said: “We need a government of the moment, with the ideas that meet the aspirations of the people.” He claimed that instead, the government was “bereft of ideas or purpose, without a guiding principle or a roadmap for delivery”. He added: “Their time has passed.” Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: “This Queen’s speech does nothing to help the millions of families and pensioners facing soaring bills and eye watering inflation. It shows a prime minister refusing to listen to the clear message sent by voters at last week’s local elections who are fed up of being taken for granted by this Conservative government.” Away from the cost of living, the government said it would introduce measures to ban no-fault evictions and tackle rogue landlords; and give councils new powers to sell off empty high street properties, in a levelling up and regeneration bill. There were also a series of measures that appeared aimed at allowing the government to pursue “culture war” issues – including a promise that local people will be consulted before street names are changed; and a ban on councils pursuing political boycotts. Dominic Raab’s plan to replace the Human Rights Act with a British bill of rights, aimed at curtailing the power of the European court of human rights in Strasbourg, was confirmed as a government priority. The speech said the legislation would “ensure there is a proper balance between the rights of individuals, our vital national security and effective government, strengthening freedom of speech”. The president of the Law Society, Stephanie Boyce, attacked the planned legislation, however, warning it would undermine human rights. “If the new bill of rights becomes law, it would make it harder for all of us to protect or enforce our rights. “The proposed changes make the state less accountable. This undermines a crucial element of the rule of law, preventing people from challenging illegitimate uses of power.” The Queens speech also confirmed the fact that proposals for a radical overhaul of the planning system have been ditched, in favour of more modest changes ministers insist will give local people more, not less, say over developments in their neighbourhoods. Previous plans envisaged a zoning system that would introduce a presumption in favour of development in some areas. These were ditched, along with the then communities secretary Robert Jenrick, after the Tories’ shock defeat in the Chesham and Amersham byelection was put partly down to fears the government was about to concrete over the green belt. The Treasury was later forced to dampen hopes of an emergency budget to help hard-pressed households, after Johnson suggested in the debate that he and the chancellor would have more to say on the cost of living crisis, “in the days to come”. Rishi Sunak has repeatedly made clear he is unwilling to act until energy regulator Ofgem has made clear how much it will increase the price cap – an announcement likely to come in August. “We’re not there yet as we don’t know where prices are going to land,” said a Treasury source. A No 10 source confirmed there were unlikely to be new spending measures to alleviate the cost of living crisis – but said all cabinet ministers had been tasked with coming up with policies in their areas to help. The government’s cost of living committee was due to meet on Tuesday evening, ahead of a cabinet awayday in Staffordshire on Thursday. Proposals mooted at previous meetings included deregulating childcare and making MOTs two-yearly.",News/Politics,Queen’s speech: Boris Johnson ‘bereft of ideas’ to tackle cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/10/queens-speech-boris-johnson-bereft-of-ideas-to-tackle-cost-of-living-crisis
5/11/2022,"Rebekah Vardy has said she deeply regrets making unflattering personal remarks about Peter Andre in a newspaper interview, as the multimillion pound “Wagatha Christie” libel trial against Coleen Rooney got under way at the high court. The trial between the two footballer’s wives is taking place in a wood-panelled Victorian-era courtroom in central London that has heard many important cases over the years – but this could be the first where physiological matters were discussed at such length. With the leaking of private information at the heart of the much-anticipated case, David Sherborne, acting for Coleen Rooney, asked Vardy whether she was the sort of person who leaked stories to the media. After Vardy said she was not, the lawyer began reading out excerpts from a 2004 interview Vardy once gave to the News of the World about a one-night stand she supposedly had with singer and entertainer Peter Andre. Sherborne quoted Vardy’s words from the interview: “Peter’s hung like a small chipolata … the smallest trouser equipment I’ve ever seen.” After Vardy confirmed she did not seek Andre’s permission to reveal this personal detail in a national newspaper, the barrister asked: “Did you feel particularly strongly about the size of his manhood that it should be made public?” Vardy insisted she “deeply regrets” the incident and was coerced into giving the interview to the tabloid against her will by her ex-husband, an allegation the ex-husband has previously denied. The week-long trial pits the two wives of former England footballers – known as Wags – against each other. In 2019, Rooney conducted an elaborate sting operation to find out who was leaking stories from her private Instagram account to journalists at the Sun, ultimately making the public accusation that: “It’s………… Rebekah Vardy’s account.” Vardy is now suing Rooney for libel, arguing that the accusation was false. After an earlier ruling, it is up to Rooney to prove Vardy was personally responsible for leaking stories to the Sun – or to convince the judge that publication of the allegation was in the public interest. Rooney and her husband, Wayne Rooney, looked on intently as Vardy gave evidence on Tuesday afternoon. Rooney’s lawyers accepted they do not have a smoking gun that shows Vardy – the wife of the Leicester City player Jamie Vardy – actively leaking stories from Rooney’s private Instagram account to the Sun. However, Sherborne told the court this did not matter due to the weight of circumstantial evidence against Vardy. “In essence this is a detective story,” he said. “Like any good detective story, you never find the person responsible standing over the body with the smoking gun in hand … There’s inference, circumstance, probability and likelihood and ultimately they all add up – so the finger will point to the right suspect or suspects.” In written submissions, Vardy’s barrister, Hugh Tomlinson QC, denied his client had personally leaked any stories to the Sun, nor had she approved or condoned “anyone else to do so on her behalf”. However, the court did hear Vardy has recently realised her former agent and close friend, Caroline Watt, may have briefed stories to the tabloid without her knowledge. Tomlinson said the “candid” WhatsApp messages previously heard in court between Vardy and Watt showed that “from time to time they did discuss ‘leaking’ information to the press”. But only one story – a drink-driving incident involving the Chelsea footballer Danny Drinkwater – was mentioned. As a result, Rooney simply “can’t establish that Mrs Vardy was responsible” for the leaks, Tomlinson told the court. He said that although the “Wagatha Christie” case was being treated as a form of entertainment by much of the media, his client had been “subjected to abuse and threats of a horrific nature” as a result of Rooney’s allegedly false accusation. Rooney’s legal team argue that Vardy and Watt made a concerted effort to destroy evidence, with a litany of technological accidents affecting the retrieval of WhatsApp messages. In one incident, Sheborne highlighted how a “poor unfortunate phone” belonging to Watt was accidentally dropped off the side of a boat in the North Sea off the coast of Scotland within “days” of a legal request to search it. In written submissions, Rooney’s lawyers said these were not a series of “unfortunate” incidents. Instead, they claimed the loss of data was part of a “deliberate and calculated” campaign by Vardy and her team to dispose of potentially incriminating evidence – and prevent a fair trial. Sherborne said it did not make a difference if it was Vardy’s agent who leaked stories to the Sun on behalf of the footballer’s wife: “It’s like hiring a hitman or woman … just because you’re not the person who gets their hands dirty doesn’t mean you’re not equally responsible.” He concluded his opening remarks by suggesting the entire case against his client – and the millions of pounds spend on years of legal proceedings – was a pointless endeavour: “This whole court might just think: ‘Why on earth are we here?’” The case continues.",News/UK news,‘Wagatha Christie’: Vardy ‘deeply regrets’ intimate Peter Andre remarks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/wagatha-christie-vardy-deeply-regrets-intimate-peter-andre-remarks
5/11/2022,"The process of adjusting to the rigours and intensity of a full season always stood as a challenging task for Emma Raducanu after her US Open victory, but, even so, her inability to remain healthy has been alarming. Some sort of ailment has affected her during most weeks of this year and it played a defining role once more in her Italian Open debut on Tuesday. After blisters, a hip injury, back issues, illness and medical timeouts, Raducanu’s struggles to find a sustained period of good health continued as she was forced to retire early in the second set of her high-profile first-round match against Bianca Andreescu with a lower back injury, an imperious Andreescu moving on after Raducanu retired as she trailed 6-2, 2-1. The retirement is naturally a concern for Raducanu leading up to the French Open, her next tournament, which begins on 22 May. She arrived in Italy nursing the back injury she struggled with in her run to the third round of the Madrid Open last week. During her practices here, she reached for her back numerous times and her movement was limited. “Definitely disappointed with how today went,” she said. “But I wanted to give it a try. I never really knew how bad it was until I went out there. “I’m still learning when it’s right to push my body and push through it and when’s not. I guess that’s something I’m learning at these tournaments.” The long-awaited contest between two US Open champions, played out on Grandstand, the second-biggest but least attractive court, was one-sided from the beginning. Andreescu arrived on court attacking relentlessly and she maintained that intensity until the end, putting pressure on her opponent with brutal returning and delicate touches alike, controlling the baseline and attacking her heavy forehand relentlessly with minimal errors. Under such sustained pressure, Raducanu veered between passively dropping the ball too short or overhitting, her body language was impassive and her movement limited. After Raducanu dropped serve for 1-2 with a double fault, Andreescu battered a backhand return winner to take the second break. Down 2-5 and flailing, Raducanu took a medical timeout for her back. After a lengthy break, a measure of Andreescu’s confidence came as she calmly returned to serve out the set to love. She finished the set with 16 winners and two unforced errors and blasted nine more winners to open the second set. Raducanu decided to put herself out of her misery, telling the umpire: “I can’t move.” Despite the unsatisfying ending for Raducanu, the match still produced some constructive conclusions for her opponent. As Andreescu continues her first steps back from a six-month mental health break and a longer period filled with physical issues, she showed more glimpses of the quality and form that had marked her as one of the most hyped talents around a few years ago. Both are playing their first full clay court seasons, but for Andreescu this is particularly reflective of the injury struggles that have plagued the early years of her career. But here Andreescu is building up rhythm, confidence and match fitness and if she can remain fit then it is clear she can mark herself as a threat for the biggest titles again. For Raducanu, the question remains what physical state she will be in for her first French Open. She has enjoyed a generally fruitful clay court season, winning matches, adapting to a surface on which she has minimal experience and appearing to enjoy her time again after a particularly difficult start to the year. But she is still constantly fighting her body and has continually suggested her body will grow accustomed to the intensity demanded of it and that it will adjust. “I need to make sure my back is fully right, however long that takes,” she said. “I need to just keep on it. I don’t want to play my next match with a feeling of limitation.” Earlier on Tuesday the British men’s No 1, Cameron Norrie, reached the second round with a 6-4, 6-4 win against Luca Nardi, a young Italian wildcard. Norrie, the ninth seed, will face Marin Cilic in the second round. Novak Djokovic, who received a first-round bye, also comfortably moved through his opening match, defeating Aslan Karatsev 6-3, 6-2 in their second-round encounter. Djokovic will face either Laslo Djere or Stan Wawrinka and he must reach the semi-final in order to keep his No 1 ranking from Daniil Medvedev going into the French Open.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu’s injury woes continue in Rome exit to Bianca Andreescu,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/10/emma-raducanus-injury-woes-continue-in-rome-exit-to-bianca-andreescu
5/11/2022,"On the other side of the world, Britain’s Filipino community have not been immune to the divisions preceding the apparent landslide victory on Tuesday of Ferdinand Marcos Jr – son and namesake of the infamous ousted dictator. Even among the UK’s sizeable expatriate community – whose hundreds of thousands include many who form the backbone of Britain’s healthcare system – friends and family have split over the choice of their homeland’s new president. “I’m afraid that there are people who no longer speak to me, and when there have been community gatherings it’s clear that people have some very strong opinions,” said Araial Ilustre, a Coventry-based occupational therapist and supporter of defeated Marcos opponent Leni Robredo, who told of co-workers falling out and social media trolling. For Ilustre – whose own family history intertwined with that of the Marcos dynasty in the form of his father’s role as a senior figure in the security detail of Ferdinand senior – the election result this week is nothing short of “a regression”, fuelled in his eyes by the impact of social media. By contrast, the prevailing mood on the streets of Earl’s Court – dubbed in the past as “Little Manila” on account of the Filipino presence – the prevailing mood was one of elation. On streets that are home to Filipino shops, cafes and restaurants, supporters of Marcos Jr – nicknamed “Bongbong” – wore red in support of his victory, apparently assured as unofficial results on Tuesday gave him more than 30.8m votes with more than 97% of the poll tabulated. Marcos Jr supporters included those who were not born when the politician’s father was ousted in a popular revolt that ended a brutal dictatorship, marked by thousands of extrajudicial killings and extensive use of torture. “Most people I know were supporting Marcos. It isn’t a surprise that he won but we were shocked by the gap between Leni and Bongbong,” said restaurant worker Kerry-Anne, 27. “Even though I don’t know much about him, I have spoken to my grandparents about him and they say that his dad was good back in the day – and I think they know better than me. That’s why I was supporting him.” A sense of trust in the family and a notion that he had “grown up in politics” was cited by others as a reason for their attraction towards Marcos, whose own time in the UK included a stint at Oxford University – albeit amid some controversy over whether he earned a degree. “It’s in his blood to run,” said business owner Michael Majdalena, 46. “For me, Marcos was the best candidate to win from all the candidates. He’ll be able to clear his dad’s bad reputation, we need to just give him a chance.” Salon owner, Jay, 58, went as far as expressing the view that the victory of Marcos would bring about a return of democracy back to the Philippines in the wake of strongman Rodrigo Duterte’s rule. “He’s the only qualified presidential candidate,” he says, “I believe in his aim to unify all the Filipino people, no matter where they are from, the wealthy and the poor. I think Marcos is the sign of a better democracy and a more progressive Philippines.” That narrative was contested by others such as Araial Ilustre – who remembered the overthrow of Marcos senior in 1986 as a moment of hope and influential precursor to the fall some years later of the Communist dictatorships of eastern Europe. “To say we are devastated is an understatement,” admitted Mira Edgemore, who works in the UK education sector and described, with a chuckle, her activism alongside others in support of Robredo as “almost like a second job”. “We understand that democracy is very fragile, but while we process the results we are also telling ourselves that it’s a long game and there’s so much to take from the campaign. “Robredo started out from a very low base, not even as the principal challenger, and we have effectively been fighting against a decade of revisionism and rebranding about what the Marcos family stood for. We’re not going to give up.”",News/World news,‘Strong opinions’: how Marcos Jr’s victory has divided UK Filipinos,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/strong-opinions-how-marcos-jr-victory-has-divided-uk-filipinos
5/11/2022,"The head of the World Health Organization has voiced concerns over China’s effort to eliminate the Covid virus, in a rare rebuke to Xi Jinping’s pledge to achieve “dynamic zero-Covid”. The WHO’s director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told a media briefing on Tuesday that his organisation does not think China’s Covid policy is “sustainable considering the behaviour of the virus”. “We have discussed about this issue with Chinese experts and we indicated that the approach will not be sustainable … I think a shift would be very important,” he said. Mike Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies director, added that the impact of a “zero Covid” policy on human rights needed to be taken into consideration alongside its economic effect. “We need to balance the control measures against the impact on society, the impact they have on the economy, and that’s not always an easy calibration,” he said. Ryan also noted that China has registered 15,000 deaths since the virus first emerged in the city of Wuhan in late 2019 – a relatively low number compared with 1 million in the US and more than 500,000 in India. With that in mind, it is understandable, Ryan said, that one of the world’s most populous countries would want to take tough measures to curb coronavirus contagion. However, he said the continued outbreaks have also underscored the difficulty of stopping the spread of the highly transmissible Omicron variant. Scores of Chinese cities – from the financial hub Shanghai to the capital, Beijing – have been under some form of lockdown since earlier this year. Shanghai is in its sixth week of lockdown, with the authorities’ heavy-handed enforcement of the policy causing anguish and anger. Despite the criticism, Xi last week reiterated that his government had no intention of changing course. The president urged officials to “unswervingly adhere to the general policy of dynamic zero-Covid” and warned against any criticism or doubting of the policy. Experts say China is in a dilemma over how to handle Covid. On Tuesday, new modelling by scientists in China and the US showed that the country risks more than 1.5 million Covid deaths if it drops its current policy without any safeguards, such as ramping up vaccination and access to treatments. The researchers said such a death toll could be much reduced if there was a focus on vaccination – only about 50% of over-80s in China are vaccinated – as well as providing antivirals while maintaining some restrictions.

5/11/2022,"On the face of it this looks like the most basic piece of maths. Here is a move that can never be the wrong move. When life gives you lemons, sign Erling Haaland. When your squad doesn’t have a first-team player whose chief skill is scoring goals, sign Erling Haaland. When six years of careful team-building brings you a Champions League semi-final exit with 31 shots at goal: sign Erling Haaland. To date Haaland’s career has been a kind of extended marketing programme, a showcase for his preternatural ability to do exactly this. Here we have the cheat code player, a bolt-on goal-guarantee, the footballer as one-punch knockout artist. Manchester City want a goalscorer. Haaland is goals, a footballer who has pared back his role to the pursuit of football’s most basic unit. What could possibly go wrong? Except, of course, this is still a dazzlingly complex sport, an interlocking of endless additions and subtractions. Teams can be brittle, high-spec things. Dig a little and the signing of Haaland is something of a departure for Pep Guardiola, even quite a reckless tactical move. Or at least one that will require a degree of applied intelligence on both side. Haaland has become a far more complete player in the past two seasons. But the fact remains, a player who could have gone anywhere has signed for a coach who will instantly set about trying to change him. City have signed the one A-list goalscorer who looks an undeniably awkward fit. This is not to suggest the move will be a failure. That would be nuts. This is a mouthwatering prospect. Guardiola is a great coach who will work like a maniac to make this fit. Haaland is a grand, generational talent but also a modern, fully briefed, academy-reared footballer. Talent plus talent solves most problems. But it is also a first on various levels: the first time City have simply gone out and bought a fantasy player, a next-best in the world, their Neymar. As ever with City it has still been smart business. The release clause transfer fee makes that part of the deal a bargain. Factor in the full range of slices, fees, top-ups, and upfront lump sums, and it’s pretty clear this is what you might call an Uncle Monty deal: very expensive to those who can’t afford it; good business for those who can. The finances will look after themselves. The real gamble here, the real point of interest, is tactical. You have to hand it to Pep. He has gone all in. This is not a hedge or a fudge. Rather than shivering awkwardly on the edge of the swimming pool, he has instead jumped right in fully clothed and bombed the shallow end, signing not just a goalscorer, but a 100% pure uncut goalscorer. “Un mercato en folie pour les buteurs,” was Le Parisien’s take on a market going crazy for goalscorers, with moves lined up for Haaland, Kylian Mbappé and Robert Lewandowski. But of these only Mbappé is in the clearest sense an out-and-out buteur, a striker whose skills are honed to a fine point. At the end of which the team that obsess most over possession have signed a star player whose one weakness is his ability to keep possession. The manager who gave us the modern passing game has signed a striker whose passing is the least developed part of his game. Guardiola is often accused of being overly fixated on his own methods. To his credit, he is well out of his comfort zone here. This is not to suggest Haaland is a monomaniac goal obsessive. On Whoscored.com’s list of Europe’s current top 10 goalscorers he’s fifth on assists. He loses the ball less than Lewandowski, Mohamed Salah and Mbappé. Most of his goals (15 of 21 in the league) have been scored with his left foot, but that showreel of one-touch finishes and neat little runs suggests his movement fits with the way City like to attack. Then, there’s the other stuff, the data flags. Haaland doesn’t just make fewer passes than any other leading goalscorer in Europe. He’s miles back. Karim Benzema makes 41 passes per 90 minutes, Mbappé 38.9, Salah 35, Cristiano Ronaldo 32.4. Haaland is right down there on 22, ranked 129th out of 193 attacking players in the top five leagues to have played more than 18 games. Among players who have filled that slot for City this season, Phil Foden completes 40.5 passes per 90 minutes, Gabriel Jesus 36, Raheem Sterling 35, Jack Grealish 41.6. Haaland has one (yes: one) accurate long pass in the Bundesliga this season. Foden has attempted 26 of these, Jesus 22. Haaland hasn’t made a single accurate cross. Mbappé has 19 of them. Haaland will improve, and play differently in a different team. But this is still a massive disparity with other top players. The point here is simply that one side of this equation will have to change. Either Haaland adapts to fit the style, and there is no reason to assume he can’t (or indeed, as yet, no reason to suggest he can either). Or City successfully adapt a system that, while it lacks a pure finisher, is based almost entirely on working that overload of passing players in midfield and attack. It is certainly a select club that Haaland is joining. Guardiola hasn’t signed a specialist goalscorer since Jesus in 2016. Before that the complete list in 16 years as a head coach reads: Lewandowski, David Villa and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. But his record of working with goalscorers is also phenomenal. Lionel Messi scored 30 league goals in two and half seasons pre-Pep, and 88 in his next three under Pep, glossed and tweaked into the prefect modern day false 9. Sergio Agüero scored more goals under Pep than before Pep. A poacher who looked a poor fit at first enjoyed the best years of his career under the great midfield obsessive. This seems to be about will and character as much as anything else. Thierry Henry has talked about the way everything in this system is based on subjugating the ego, keeping to your position, allowing the rest of the team to set patterns, to accept the game will be won this way, not your way. The early fallings out with Ibrahimovic and Samuel Eto’o were mired in talk of disrespect and the like, Guardiola refusing to bend to the needs of big-ego players, seeing only his own team-building zeal. Haaland will know all this of course. City and Pep will have done their own thorough due diligence. Plus Guardiola knows better than anyone that teams evolve, that Haaland brings his own edge and energy, that this can be a moment of addition not dilution. Both parties have a rare free summer to work at it, to find those new shapes and patterns. A simple sum in so many ways; but also endlessly complex.",Sport/Football,Haaland is a fantasy player but he or Manchester City will have to change | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/may/10/erling-haaland-to-manchester-city-is-a-tactical-gamble-that-might-just-pay-off
5/11/2022,"Police in Bristol are treating an incident in which a white woman hit a 12-year-old black boy on the forehead with paddle as racially motivated after initially deciding not to prosecute. A review, overseen by a senior officer, has been launched into the attack, which left Antwon Forrest, who is autistic, needing hospital treatment for a deep cut. Avon and Somerset police have apologised for how they handled the case. There was an outcry after Antwon’s family published images of the boy’s injury and video of the woman, who works for a luxury car company, confronting him and other children at a riverside park. The woman was arrested, but three weeks later an officer told the boy’s family that no further action was being taken because the alleged attacker said she had acted in self-defence and felt “threatened”. Antwon’s family said they believe the incident could have been a hate crime because the woman appeared to have clashed with him rather than any of the white friends he was with. On Tuesday the force said it was treating the incident as racially motivated and appealed for more witnesses. The Bristol commander, Supt Mark Runacres, another senior officer, Ch Insp Mike Buck, and a community leader have met the boy’s father. Buck said: “We have complete empathy with his family and listened carefully to what he had to say. We gave a full commitment to carrying out a comprehensive review. We’ve re-classified this incident as being racially motivated and we have a detective sergeant leading the review, with oversight from a senior officer. “The review will include identifying and taking statements from as many people who witnessed this incident as possible, locating and viewing all available footage, re-examining 999 calls, compiling medical evidence and liaising with relevant partner agencies. “There will be learnings coming out of this. We’ve already identified the family should have been offered a right to review following the initial decision not to take any further action, and we have said sorry for that.” The boy’s father, Tyran Forrest, who is mixed race, said on Friday: “If it was me that had hit a white child, I would be in jail right now.” Forrest claimed some of the children – but not Antwon – were throwing mudballs at passing boats, including one being paddled by the woman. What followed allegedly involved some pushing and shouting and ended up with Antwon being struck by the woman with a paddle. Antwon’s cut was so deep it had to be glued together.

5/11/2022,"Theresa May has warned Boris Johnson that tearing up parts of the Northern Ireland protocol could harm Britain’s reputation for abiding by international law, as the UK and EU remained at a standstill in negotiations. The former prime minister made her intervention as Johnson and Liz Truss, his foreign secretary, were considering whether to unilaterally suspend parts of the protocol – the controversial post-Brexit regulatory framework that aligns Northern Ireland more closely with the EU than the rest of the UK. Speaking in the Commons, May told them they needed to consider the “wider sense of what such a move would say about the United Kingdom and its willingness to abide by treaties which it has signed”. But Johnson warned Micheál Martin, the Irish prime minister, on Tuesday that the situation was “now very serious”, suggesting that the UK may take its own steps to ignore parts of the protocol that have created trade barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. “The prime minister reiterated that the UK government would take action to protect peace and political stability in Northern Ireland if solutions could not be found,” Martin said. A No 10 spokesperson insisted “no decisions have been taken”, and added: “We want to fix some of the underlying challenges, and think the situation is extremely serious.” Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, has been in talks with the major parties in Northern Ireland since Sinn Féin became the biggest party on the assembly for the first time. The Democratic Unionists were pushed into second place and are refusing to resume power sharing without changes to the protocol. Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP leader, told the Commons on Tuesday that there was “no consensus” in Northern Ireland for the protocol, and it was harming the economy. He added on Twitter: “Spoke to the prime minister this morning and reiterated our position that we cannot nominate to an executive until decisive action is taken on the protocol.” However, at the same time, the European Union executive ruled out any renegotiation of the protocol, responding to reports that Truss was planning to ditch the agreement. In a statement after the Queen’s speech, Maroš Šefčovič, the European Commission vice-president responsible for post-Brexit relations, said: “From the very beginning, the EU has worked tirelessly to propose creative and durable solutions, showing flexibility on how the protocol should be implemented. “The protocol, as a cornerstone of the withdrawal agreement, is an international agreement. Its renegotiation is not an option. The European Union is united in this position.” One EU official said it was expected that Johnson’s government would keep tapping into Brexit outrage, adding: “There might be a respect with what both sides are doing in Ukraine, but trust is irredeemably broken with this government.” Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin vice-president, also insisted the protocol was “here to stay”. “I did speak to Boris Johnson and I made it very clear to him that his pandering to the DUP and the dialling up of rhetoric serves no purpose to provide the certainty and stability that people here want to see. This action of the British government today in cahoots with the DUP punishes the people here,” she said. Donaldson told reporters in London that he was committed to leading the DUP into political institutions at Stormont. But he added: “I’m also very clear we need to resolve the issues here in terms of the protocol and I will be making my position clear on that before the end of this week.” Asked if he would stay on as an MP or take up his mandate to be a member of the legislative assembly, Donaldson said: “In the short term a choice has to be made on that. I will come to a decision with my colleagues.”",News/UK news,"UK risks reputation if it breaches Northern Ireland protocol, warns May",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/10/uk-risks-reputation-if-it-breaches-northern-ireland-protocol-warns-may
5/11/2022,"Celebrity chef Mario Batali has been cleared of sexual misconduct after a criminal trial in Boston. A woman had accused Batali of forcibly kissing and groping her while taking a selfie at a restaurant in 2017. Batali’s lawyer argued that the Boston assault never happened and said the accuser had a financial incentive to lie about the encounter. The judge found Batali not guilty on Tuesday. The chef had waived his right to a jury trial, leaving his fate in the hands of the judge, James Stanton. Batali had pleaded not guilty to indecent assault and battery charges, which carried up to two and a half years in prison and potential sex offender registration. Batali’s accuser has filed a lawsuit that remains pending despite Tuesday’s verdict in Boston municipal court. The career of the 61-year-old former Food Network fixture crumbled amid sexual misconduct allegations from four women in 2017. The accuser in this week’s swiftly moving trial, a 32-year-old software company worker, testified on Monday that she had felt confused, powerless and embarrassed to share her story until other women stepped forward to share similar encounters with Batali during the early phase of the #MeToo social justice movement.

5/11/2022,"The Marcos family has spent years rebranding its image, falsely portraying the authoritarian rule of Marcos Sr in which billions were plundered as a golden era and downplaying past atrocities. Researchers have described an onslaught of disinformation designed to revise history, enhance the reputation of the Marcoses and undermine their opponents. Many voters are not old enough to remember Marcos’s rule, which ended in 1986, and academics warn that the period is not taught thoroughly in schools, creating a vulnerability the Marcoses and their backers have exploited. Many supporters say they do not believe the family has plundered state money, despite numerous court rulings. Some analysts say a Marcos election is a continuation of a populist wave that started with president Rodrigo Duterte and reflects frustration with previous administrations’ failure to provide sufficient, tangible reforms following the People Power Revolution that ousted Marcos Sr. Duterte did not officially endorse Marcos as a presidential candidate, nor has he always been complimentary. Last year, Duterte called Marcos Jr a “spoiled child” and “weak leader”, even as Marcos was campaigning on a joint ticket with his daughter. In a separate speech, he claimed a presidential candidate who had a prominent father, a thinly veiled reference to Marcos, was a cocaine user. During his presidency, however, Duterte has enabled the rehabilitation of the Marcos name, including by recommending Marcos Sr be given a hero’s burial with military honours in 2016. “The propagation of the myth of a golden age under the Marcos dictatorship played to his advantage while he was president,” said Sol Iglesias, assistant professor of political science at the University of the Philippines, who said such narratives were aligned with his own strongman leadership. “But upon stepping down, his main interest would be avoiding accountability,” she added. Duterte’s more recent jibes at Marcos may stem from an irritation that his daughter was running for the vice-presidency, and not the top job. Whoever is president will need to decide whether or not to cooperate with the international criminal court, which has launched an investigation into Duterte’s so-called “war on drugs”. Sara Duterte, 43, first attracted national attention a decade ago, when she punched a local sheriff four times in the head, in front of a crowd of reporters. She was then mayor of Davao City, on the southern island of Mindanao, where the family is extremely powerful. She has previously swapped places with her father as mayor of Davao, and held the role until earlier this year.A motorbike lover, she has the same tough style as her father. However, her rhetoric is less crude and extreme (he has called the pope a “son of a whore”, joked about rape, and once appeared to compare himself to Hitler). Many had anticipated that she would run for the presidency, and last year posters appeared across the country with the words: “Run, Sara, run”. Running in tandem with Marcos brought together two of the Philippines’ most powerful political families, and united their support bases in the north and south of the country. Their partnership reflects not just mutual preservation of their families, but of the broader system of political dynasties that dominate politics in the Philippines, said Iglesias, who referred to reports their partnership was brokered by the former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. “If she hadn’t brokered this tandem, they might have run against each other, and that would have cannibalised their mutually reinforcing bases,” said Iglesias. In such a scenario, victory might have been within the grasp of someone like the vice-president Leni Robredo, a candidate who had promised reform, including an anti-dynasty law. If the results from the initial vote count are confirmed, Marcos Jr will have a huge mandate. However, his campaign was thin on policy detail, and so analysts say it is not clear how he will use this advantage. Marcos may seek to change the 1987 constitution, said Iglesias. For example, he may try to change a rule that bars presidents from seeking re-election at the end of a six-year term. Marcos will inherit a challenging economic situation, added Sonny Africa, executive director of IBON Foundation. “The last central bank data from the last quarter of 2021 showed that seven out of 10 families don’t have any savings at all, whether in the bank or under their mattress,” he said, while huge numbers of small businesses have collapsed. However, the Marcos camp did not provide an overview of how it would tackle these problems, he added. Marcos has said that he would only allow visitors from the international criminal court to enter the country as tourists, preventing its prosecutors from investigating Duterte’s “war on drugs” in the country. He is also expected to pursue closer ties with China, continuing the policy of the Duterte administration.",News/World news,Philippines election Q&A: why did Marcos Jr win and what can we expect from his presidency?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/philippines-election-qa-why-did-macros-jr-win-and-what-can-we-expect-from-his-presidency
5/11/2022,"There had been no time to reprint the official souvenir programme, so the front page read: “The ceremonial to be observed at the opening of parliament by Her Majesty the Queen.” Except the Queen was nowhere to be seen as her 96 years had caught up with her and she had decided enough was enough. For now at least, though no one was counting on her reprising the role that she had performed at every state opening since 1963 when she was pregnant with Prince Edward. So this was quite the moment for the House of Lords and royal watchers. If not for Boris Johnson and his government. By any standards theirs was a Queen’s speech devoid of imagination and ideas. All the more so when the country is on its knees. Prince Charles and Prince William duly shuffled in behind the Rouge Dragon Pursuivant, the Clarenceux King of Arms and various other members of the aristocracy who had been let loose in the dressing up box. With minimal fuss the Commons was summoned and, on their way over to the Lords, The Convict and Keir Starmer appeared to enjoy a surprisingly jolly conversation. “What are you going down for?”, “I done nuffink. I was fitted up”, “Me neither”. That sort of thing. Prison talk. Then came the speech itself and Charles couldn’t have sounded more bored. A chip off the old block. His mother must be proud. She has a long record of making her disenchantment with the current bunch of politicians plain with a dull, monotone delivery. An objectivity laced with contempt. Her Majesty’s government will … Well, what would it do? Almost certainly nothing to address the cost of living. The current bunch were more interested in fighting culture wars than in making sure people could afford to eat. Her Majesty’s government will … Make sure that every child fulfils its potential. Some hope. Charles was well over 70 and nowhere close to fulfilling his. Though today was a step in the right direction. As for the bill of rights, this was the first one to impose restrictions on its citizens. More a bill of wrongs. Charles lapsed into silence, the whole event drifting into anticlimax. There was nothing here for anyone to get excited by. A couple of hours later the Commons reconvened for the first session of the new parliament and Lindsay Hoyle began proceedings by reminding members of how they were expected to behave. If anyone misled MPs inadvertently they should be sure to correct the record at the soonest available opportunity. The Convict nodded his head enthusiastically. It was clearly still just fine to deliberately mislead the house. So no need to stop lying. He was also cheered to discover that the Speaker was pressing the reset button and that all previous offences would be considered null and void. Now for the Metropolitan police to follow suit. Then came the two traditional government backbench speeches – one from an MP considered to be past it and the other from an MP thought to be on the way up – which begin every parliament and by and large they delivered on the brief. They were jolly enough and mercifully short. Graham Stuart played the thankless old duffer card and got in one good dig at the Labour leader, saying the only thing going up for Starmer in the north was a police investigation. His korma gag fell flat. All the curry puns have been done to death in the past few weeks by the rightwing tabloids. Time for some new material all round. Fay Jones took the role of the young upstart and just about fell the right side of entertaining. Though it was closer than she might have hoped. Long before the end she had lost the attention of many in the chamber. It’s a tough gig. Still, Stuart and Jones turned out to be a glittering high spot of the day compared with what followed. Next up were the leaders of the two main parties. Starmer began well enough with a reminder to Johnson that he was the first prime minister to have a Labour council, along with tributes to David Amess, James Brokenshire and Jack Dromey, who had died in the last parliament. But after that, he never really got out of second gear. Even his gags had punchlines that were telegraphed well in advance. It was as if the Beergate allegations had finally got to Starmer and he was sleep-walking through his speech. Hamstrung by his inability to attack The Convict’s integrity. He got all the right material in – the cost of living crisis, inflation and the Tories’ seemingly abject cluelessness: they know they don’t know what they’re doing, but just don’t give a toss providing they are the ones in charge of doing nothing about it – but just not in the right order. He went on and on about “a government of the moment” but no one was listening. Least of all on his own benches. He’ll need to up his game. Much more of this and some of his MPs will begin to hope he does get a fine so they can get a leader who doesn’t just have integrity but is inspirational with it. It was some comfort to Starmer, though, that The Convict was just as poor. He knew there was nothing of any substance to deal with the cost of living crisis in the Queen’s speech and he couldn’t even be bothered to conceal it. Who cared? Certainly not his MPs. He did briefly threaten an emergency budget before Number 10 had to confirm there were no immediate plans for one after all. He also lied about Labour’s immigration plans under Tony Blair. Start as you mean to go on. The Convict then appeared to get bored by his own speech and raced to a garbled finish. The words began to spew out in an unintelligible jumble and he didn’t even attempt to look apologetic. He just seemed knackered and washed out. Maybe Partygate is getting to him too. Not enough for him to do the honourable thing and resign, but enough to be causing him psychological disturbance. Even a narcissistic sociopath has a bad day. Labour took to trying to make interventions. To help them stay awake as much as anything. By far the most impressive speech came from Theresa May, who reminded the government and the DUP that they had both signed up to the Northern Ireland protocol and were bound to comply with it. She also lamented the lack of an employment bill. We’ve reached a point where the Maybot is a lone voice of morality. When she was prime minister, she was hopelessly incompetent. But at least she was useless for the best of motives. Now we’re in the political badlands.

5/11/2022,"Electronic Arts has announced that it will cease making Fifa-branded football games next year. From 2023, the series will continue under a new brand, EA Sports FC. In a press release on the decision, EA stated that licensing deals remain in place with 19,000 players, 700 teams, and more than 30 leagues from around the world, as well as with UEFA, which means the Champions League will still be a part of the game, although the World Cup will not. The Fifa titles have been an annual fixture in game charts since the release of 1993’s Fifa International Soccer on the Sega Mega Drive. Since then the titles have sold more than 325m copies around the world, dominating the football simulation market and seeing off competitors such as Actua Soccer and Pro Evolution Soccer. The possibility of a split between Electronic Arts and Fifa was first reported by the New York Times last October when it was claimed that Fifa was looking to double its licensing fee to $1bn. Speaking to the BBC, David Jackson, vice president of EA Sports said that the publisher has plans to extend the game beyond interactive matches, but that the licensing restrictions imposed by Fifa were prohibitive. “At the moment, we engage in play as a primary form of interactive experience. Soon, watching and creating content are going to be equally as important for fans,” said Jackson. “Under the licensing conventions that we had agreed with Fifa 10 years ago, there were some restrictions that weren’t going to allow us to be able to build those experiences for players.” It’s likely that Electronic Arts will look to capitalise on the massive success of ‘live service’ games such as Fortnite and its own Apex Legends, where annual release schedules have been replaced by an evolving experience with seasonal subscription fees, live events and greater player customisation options. Watching live matches and esports competitions could also be part of the new series. Electronic Arts has attracted criticism for the ‘loot box’-style monetisation of its popular Ultimate Team mode, in which fans pay for randomised digital packets of players with which to build their own superstar sides. In 2018, Belgian effectively banned loot box mechanics in games when they were classified as unregulated gambling. Governments around the world have since looked into tightening regulations. For its part, Fifa has confirmed a new non-exclusive model for the future of the Fifa game titles. In a press release sent out two hours after EA’s, the football governing body stated, “a number of new non-simulation games are already under production and will launch during the third quarter of this year”. Fifa did not share details on which games publishers it is working with. However, in a combative statement Fifa president Gianni Infantino said, “I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the Fifa name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans. The Fifa name is the only global, original title. Fifa 23, Fifa 24, Fifa 25 and Fifa 26, and so on - the constant is the Fifa name and it will remain forever and remain THE BEST”. EA has not disclosed details on the plan for monetising its future football games, but industry watchers will be interested to see if it rolls back on its profitable Ultimate Team model. Fans will also await more solid information on EA’s promises to introduce fresh modes and innovate in new areas such as the women’s game and grassroots football.",Arts/Games,Electronic Arts ditches Fifa for future football games,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/10/electronic-arts-ditches-fifa-ea-sports-fc
5/11/2022,"A Republican US senator called local police to investigate a pro-abortion rights – but otherwise harmless – message written in chalk in front of her home, according to authorities. The Maine senator Susan Collins called officers last Saturday evening to complain about an anonymous message written in chalk on a sidewalk just outside her residence in Bangor that asked her to support abortion rights legislation, according to a police report that was obtained by the Guardian. The chalk art, described in the police report as “intricately drawn” and non-threatening, read: “Susie, please, Mainers want WHPA —–> vote yes, clean up your mess.” WHPA refers to the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would codify abortion rights. In the report, police wrote that they did not notice anything suspicious around Collins’s residence. They also said that the chalk message did not constitute a crime. A Bangor public works department employee later went to Collins’s home to wash off the chalk message. The senator provided a statement to the Bangor Daily News, which first reported on the chalk message, saying, “We are grateful to the Bangor police officers and the city public works employee who responded to the defacement of public property in front of our home.” With last week’s leak of a draft opinion showing that the US supreme court is poised to overturn Roe v Wade, the 1973 landmark decision which legalized abortion, Collins has faced criticism from voters for helping block the advancement of the WHPA to the Senate floor for debate in February. The Senate plans to again vote on potentially advancing the WHPA this Wednesday. Collins has signaled she plans to again oppose the WHPA, which would need 60 votes to advance, a threshold that most doubt the bill will clear. She, along with Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a fellow Republican, has introduced a different bill that would codify abortion rights while still allowing individual states to roll back protections. Collins has also been criticized for backing the confirmation of the supreme court justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who form part of the court’s conservative majority that supports overturning Roe v Wade, according to the leaked draft opinion. After the leak, Collins sought to distance herself from Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, issuing a statement decrying the two justices as being “completely inconsistent” with what they said during their confirmation hearings or in conversations with her. Collins suggested both had indicated they would not support overturning Roe v Wade. “If this leaked draft opinion is the final decision … it would be completely inconsistent with what Justice Gorsuch and Justice Kavanaugh said in their hearings and in our meetings in my office,” Collins’ statement said.",News/US news,Susan Collins calls the cops over polite abortion message chalked outside home,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/10/susan-collins-chalk-message-abortion-police

Musk, the world’s richest man because of his stake in the electric car company Tesla, revealed his initial stake in New York-listed Twitter on 4 April, and agreed to a $44bn (£36bn) deal on 25 April after several weeks of rapid negotiations. “I would reverse the permanent ban,” Musk said on Tuesday, speaking via video link at a car industry conference organised by the Financial Times. “I do think it was not correct to ban Donald Trump,” he said. “I think that was a mistake. It alienated the country and did not result in Donald Trump not having a voice. “I think it was a morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme.” Twitter co-founder and former CEO Jack Dorsey echoed Musk in a Tuesday tweet, saying “generally permanent bans are a failure of ours and don’t work”. Trump has stated publicly that he would not return to Twitter even if he were allowed to, preferring instead the Truth Social network founded under his name. However, Trump did not start posting on the struggling platform beyond an initial introductory message until May – nearly two and half months after the launch of Truth Social. Many of Trump’s political opponents believe he would be unlikely to pass up the opportunity to broadcast to Twitter’s much larger audience. A return would potentially give Trump a larger platform to influence the next US presidential election in 2024, either as a candidate or as a kingmaker among Republican candidates. Musk also reiterated criticisms that Twitter’s staff are too leftwing, saying they were influenced by being headquartered in San Francisco, regarded as one of the most liberal cities in the US . Twitter is “coming out of an environment that is very far left”, he said. “Twitter needs to be much more even-handed,” he said. “It’s currently left-biased.” He also said the Twitter takeover would be completed in a “best-case scenario” only within the next two or three months. “It is for me not a done deal,” he said.",News/Technology,Elon Musk pledges to overturn Twitter’s ban on Donald Trump,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/elon-musk-pledges-overturn-twitter-ban-donald-trump
