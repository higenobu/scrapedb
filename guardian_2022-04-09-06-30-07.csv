4/9/2022,"In January 2020, a New Zealand man sent two emails to prime minister Jacinda Ardern: one threatening to “personally wipe [her] off this fucking planet” and another saying he would blow her head off. It was the violent culmination of 88 lengthy emails sent over a four month period to government officials in which he referred to them as criminals and terrorists. Last week, the man, Michael Cruickshank, 56, was unapologetic as he was sentenced to one year in prison for threatening to kill the prime minister. Judge Gibson denied the defence’s request for home detention, on the basis that public officials were very much at risk of threats to their lives and the court must act accordingly. The offence “strikes at the roots of our democracy”, he said. The public officials who are being targeted more than most, and in increasingly more violent and alarming ways, are women in politics. The current parliament is the most diverse in New Zealand’s history, with its highest representation of women. There are now 58 female MPs, making up 48% of elected members – 12 more than in 2017, when Ardern first took office. Three out of the five parties voted in are either led, or co-led, by women. Ardern has ticked off a few firsts for women in politics – she is the first New Zealand prime minister to give birth while in office, and the second in the world, and under her leadership Nanaia Mahuta became the country’s first female minister of foreign affairs. But as women forge their way across uncharted territory in politics, and become more visible, an old warning with a modern twist emerges: here be trolls. Female MPs are battling a constantly rising tide of misogynistic abuse – from rape and death threats, to derogatory comments about appearances and questioning of their qualifications – much of which is being spewed out online by people hiding behind anonymous social media accounts. There has been an exponential growth in this type of abuse, says Kate Hannah, a project lead on The Disinformation Project, which maps online misinformation, disinformation and the spread of dangerous and hateful comments. “We can definitively say … that between the period of, say August to November last year, the level of misogynistic targeting of women in the public eye, including MPs, increased almost day on day.” The content of the abuse is rooted in traditional and conservative views of women’s role in society and classic misogyny, with frequent references to motherhood, witchcraft and sexual behaviour. The tone is becoming “more vulgar and heightened,” Hannah says. Misogyny is not just about hatred of women, it is about the control and punishment of women who are challenging male dominance, Hannah says. When you have a government, with highly visible, powerful women, those feeling challenged start to get upset. “There is a lot of stuff about objectifying and controlling and keeping women ‘in their place’,” she says. The abuse extends to relatively low-profile public servants too, Hannah says, who may not have the same level of security. “I am personally, and professionally, fearful we will have our own Jo Cox moment,” she says, referring to the British MP who was shot and stabbed to death by a far-right terrorist in 2016. The police say they take threats of abuse seriously and will investigate matters where appropriate. But Hannah says the regulatory framework for protecting people against online threats is both murky and poor, adding that there needs to be a “one-stop-shop” where someone can report abuse and action is taken either with the social media platform or via police. “There is a real deep-rooted sense of hatred,” says Debbie Ngarewa-Packer, the co-leader of Te Pati Māori (the Māori party). Since Ngarewa-Packer entered parliament in 2020, the threats against her have escalated, and are also nasty in their anti-Māori specificity, calling for her to experience the horrors – including rape and murder – her ancestors went through at the hands of colonisers. “It can really be quite soul destroying, because the things I was raised to be proud of are the things that make the attackers most uncomfortable.” Recently, Ngarewa-Packer’s husband has been attacked and someone has scaled her apartment building, while threats come from both anonymous and identifiable people in voicemails, emails and social media comments. The threats become more pronounced whenever anything to do with Māori policy arises, regardless of whether it is a policy supported by her party, she says. “I would not be surprised if young Māori women who are very proud of their identity don’t step up because that [hatred] is so deep rooted.” An MP from the right-wing ACT Party, Karen Chhour, who is also Māori, says the harassment levelled at her is more personal than political compared with her male colleagues. She accepts that part of having a public role is facing criticism but abuse threatens the accessibility New Zealanders have to politicians. “That’s what makes our country so special – politicians are accessible – and I would hate to see that change.” While the abuse often comes from the public, the flames can be fanned within parliament’s halls and by those associated with political parties. Last week, news website Stuff reported on a campaign of misogynistic online bullying against left-wing female politicians Megan Woods, the housing minister, Labour MP Sarah Pallett and Christchurch city councillor Sara Templeton. The abuse came from a fake social media account and was eventually linked to a member of the youth wing of the National Party – the Young Nats – who has since left the group. Centre-right National Party MP Nicola Willis condemned the behaviour and acknowledged Templeton for notifying police. “What that has done has reminded a lot of people – keyboard warriors, anonymous people – that in fact they are not anonymous. When they harass people they can be found out.” Willis said she hasn’t experienced the same level of abuse as some other women, but she regularly faces misogynistic comments and people “seeking to silence” her. “I find that reprehensible because the message that sends is: if you’re a woman in politics, don’t be too feisty, don’t be too loud … because then someone might attack you for it.” Left-wing Green Party MP Golriz Ghahraman, the country’s first refugee member of parliament, experienced an onslaught of abuse from the moment she entered politics. “It became very violent, very quickly.” In her 2017 maiden speech to parliament – 18 months before the Christchurch mosque attacks – she highlighted the prevalence of racism in New Zealand and referenced comments on her social media threads that said it was “time to load our shotguns”. In 2019 she was assigned a security escort following a series of death threats – abuse that she believes escalated after comments from other politicians. “When we play communities, rather than issues, when we debate immigration in a xenophobic way … there are communities out there that you’re making unsafe,” she said of politicians who rely on these tactics. The people copping the most abuse in parliament – women, Māori, and people of colour – are the same groups being abused within the community, or watching abuse towards politicians play out online, Ghahraman says. “There’s this threat of making politics less accessible and less diverse if we act like it’s just a given that women who make themselves visible are going to get this kind of threat.”",News/World news,Here be trolls: New Zealand’s female politicians battle rising tide of misogyny,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/here-be-trolls-new-zealands-female-politicians-battle-rising-tide-of-misogyny
4/9/2022,"Eyebrows were raised when Newcastle United triggered the £25m release clause in Chris Wood’s contract in January. The consensus was that Eddie Howe had overpaid but it seemed money very well spent here as Wood’s second-half penalty lifted his new side to the heady heights of 14th in the Premier League, virtually extinguishing Tyneside’s fears of Championship football next season. Bruno Lage’s Wolves arrived with loftier aims but paid the price for an appalling lack of ambition and were fortunate not to fall behind in the first half when Wood had a goal disallowed. With Newcastle inhabiting the often hazardous borderland between relegation waters and mid-table terra firma and Wolves sitting right on the margin separating European qualification from the also ranks there was plenty at stake. If the absence of arguably the visitors’ two best players; the suspended Raúl Jiménez and the injured Rúben Neves offered home fans cause for cautious optimism, Howe was suitably wary. It was not just that his side needed to arrest a run of three straight defeats but that their 5-1 thrashing at Tottenham last Sunday had been alarmingly comprehensive. Newcastle’s manager claimed that his team were now playing for their futures and had seen “another side” to him in training this week but he resisted making wholesale changes. Indeed with Bruno Guimãraes replacing the injured Joe Willock the only unforced alteration saw Emil Krafth take over from Javier Manquillo at right back. By the 12th minute though Howe had no option but to shuffle his pack, sending the latterly little-used Miguel Almirón on in place of the hamstrung Ryan Fraser. At this stage it had become clear Lage’s side were on a mission to draw the sting from Newcastle’s early attacking aggression and, slowing the tempo at every opportunity, they succeeded in frustrating both their hosts and another full house at St James’ Park. It left both goalkeepers under-occupied amid a surfeit of sideways and backwards passing. Admittedly odd improvisational cameos raised the tone with Jonjo Shelvey’s glorious chipped pass to Allan Saint-Maximin lingering in the memory but these were exceptions to the general rule. The crowd’s mounting anxiety lifted briefly when Almirón’s wonderfully audacious back heel prefaced Chris Wood overcoming the fact that he was down on the ground in the penalty area by extending a leg and somehow hooking the ball into the net. As Newcastle celebrated and Lage threatened to implode, a VAR review revealed that Guimãraes had been fractionally offside in the buildup and the goal was ruled out. As the Wolves manager gradually calmed down the action reverted to earlier type. In other words it revolved around a mix of far too many cheap concessions of possession from both teams and a series of increasing desperate long balls on Newcastle’s part. Indeed by half-time the visiting determination to play a primarily horizontal game – Wolves sole half chance involved Jonny blasting a shot well off target – had served as a highly effective mute button virtually silencing an initially raucous arena. Wolves were not merely unambitious, they were so poor it was hard to credit precisely how they have enjoyed such a fine season.It speaks volumes that when the game’s first corner was finally awarded – to Wolves – in the 49th minute it felt like a big event. Unfortunately, if typically, it came to nothing. At least Lage’s side were beginning to make a few, albeit still fairly rare, expeditions out of their own half and, with Hee-Chang Hwang and João Moutinho waking up a little had even started breaking into Newcastle’s box from time to time. When, in the fall out from a free-kick, Moutinho conjured a fabulous volleyed cross no one, typically, could connect with it. Had Fábio Silva been able to meet that delivery Howe’s defence could have been in trouble. They badly needed to regain the initiative but when Wood flicked a dangerous ball on in the area it fell to Dan Burn and the central defender shot straight at José Sá. When Saint-Maximin lofted a half volley over the bar from a promising position the pessimism in the stands felt almost palpable but then Wood won that penalty. Played in by some fancy footwork on the part of Saint-Maximin and then Joelinton, the New Zealand centre-forward cleverly left his foot in as he invited Sá to trip him. As the striker fell to earth and the referee, Peter Bankes, pointed to the penalty spot, Lage’s goalkeeper turned incandescent, punching thin air in fury. Once he calmed down – and a VAR review confirmed he had not been offside – Wood took the kick himself, striking it high into the net as Sá went the wrong way. With Martin Dubravka’s save subsequently denied Silva to equalise from Marcal’s cross, it was enough to ensured the decibel level was restored to full volume at the final whistle.",Sport/Football,Chris Wood penalty sinks Wolves and eases Newcastle’s relegation fears,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/08/newcastle-wolves-premier-league-match-report
4/9/2022,"Boris Johnson has agreed with the view of one of his minister’s that some Covid regulations appeared “inhumane” in retrospect, while arguing it was impossible to rule out another lockdown in the future. In an interview with GB News conducted by two backbench Tory MPs, Philip Davies and Esther McVey, Johnson also argued that “a lot of nonsense” had been said about lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street. Davies and McVey, both lockdown sceptics, asked the prime minister about comments on Monday by Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit opportunities minister, who said some lockdown rules had been “unkind and inhumane”. Asked if he agreed, Johnson said: “I do. I do. And I think that some of them – I understand why people feel that, and I think people felt that particularly the loss of the ability to see their loved ones in care homes, or to meet properly for funerals. I mean, it was just appalling, to say nothing of the loss of religious services that matter so much to people’s spirit. So, I totally understand that.” Questioned about the possibility of a full lockdown in the future, Johnson said he could not rule it out, while stressing that the primary focus would be “to go for the earliest possible programme of inoculation and vaccination”. Pressed on lockdowns, he said: “Look, I think it would be irresponsible of any leader, in any democracy, to say that they’re going to rule out something that could save life. And I believe that the things that we did saved lives. There could be – I’ve got to be absolutely frank with you – there could be a new variant, more deadly, there could be a variant that affects children, badly, that we really need to contain. I’m not going to take any options off the table. “But I don’t think it will happen. I think we’re now in the phase of – and this is the view of all the advisers I talk to – that we’re now in the phase where the virus is losing its potency overall and we’ve got a massively vaccinated UK population.” Asked about parties in and around Downing Street, for which some officials have been fined by police, and over which Johnson faces the possibility of a fine himself, he largely declined to discuss the issue. “On what actually happened … a lot of nonsense has been talked but I just think it’s much better if I wait until the conclusion of the inquiry before saying anything further,” Johnson said. “I’ve said I won’t comment on it, what I will do is say much more at the end. And what we’re getting on with – I’ve got to let the police get on with their job.” Asked about his bout of Covid two years ago, which involved a stint in intensive care, Johnson said his oxygen saturation levels had dropped into the 80s by percent. “You should be roughly 94%, or above 94%, oxygenation of the blood and I think when I went in I was in the 80s somewhere, I think, and I then had a pretty groggy night and, you know, went down even lower,” Johnson said. He said he had been told by doctors he needed hospitalisation. “It wasn’t sort of my idea. I think when you’re going through something like that you don’t actually think of it in those terms. “I was thinking about, you know, all the stuff I had to do. I mean, I was literally, I spend most of the time thinking: ‘I wish I could get out of here because I’m pretty certain I’ve got to do a press conference tomorrow morning, I’m pretty certain I’ve got to be making some announcement or other.’”",News/Politics,Boris Johnson says ‘lot of nonsense’ talked about No 10 lockdown parties,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/08/boris-johnson-no-10-lockdown-parties-gb-news-interview
4/9/2022,"Jürgen Klopp says this will not be the title decider. OK, Jürgen. If you say so, Jürgen. Perhaps we can safely file that away with “every opponent is a tough opponent” and “we don’t look at the league table” in the catalogue of great managerial sleights of our time. The rest of us, meanwhile, are entitled to regard Manchester City v Liverpool for what it is: a fixture that has been burning a hole in the schedule since August, that as the weeks passed was anticipated first in hope, then in expectation, and now finally in a barely disguised longing. It is more than five years since Klopp and Pep Guardiola first clapped eyes on each other across a crowded Premier League technical area. In that time they have built a rivalry that in terms of sheer brutish footballing quality may be the finest English football has seen. The game is fitter and faster, more complex and refined than it has ever been. The Norwich City of 2022 would wipe the floor with Manchester United’s class of 1992. And at the vanguard of the revolution, these two coaches, these two clubs: a duel worthy of being anointed as England’s clásico, a buffet of the very finest fare this sport has to offer. When Guardiola describes Liverpool as “the toughest opponent I have faced in my 13 years as a manager” – above sides such as José Mourinho’s Real Madrid, Diego Simeone’s Atlético Madrid and Antonio Conte’s Chelsea – you get some idea of the levels here. Not since the 1980s, perhaps before that, has English football been able to boast indisputably the best two teams in the world. And in order to grasp the magnitude of what Guardiola and Klopp have achieved it is instructive to go back to their first meeting in England, an ugly and unlovable 1-0 Liverpool win at Anfield on the last day of 2016. Liverpool looked ragged and brittle. City looked disjointed and uncertain. The teamsheets from that day are a reminder of the crude raw materials these blue‑chip coaches initially had to work with: Ragnar Klavan and Emre Can, Claudio Bravo and Nicolás Otamendi. Only four players on each side are still at the club. Gini Wijnaldum’s winning header was one of three shots on target. “We don’t want to show how good we are, we want the points,” a drained and dissatisfied Klopp insisted afterwards. In terms of outlook, City and Liverpool have come curiously full circle. For Guardiola and Klopp, at the very outset results were the thing: the points on the board that would earn them the time and space to express their vision. Then, from about 2018 to 2020, came the great leap forward: the years of discovery and wonder, of rebirth and reconstruction, two teams exploring the outer limits of their potential, tactically and stylistically and emotionally. The blueprints are firmly established. The terms of engagement are familiar. Audiences both partisan and neutral instinctively know how these teams will look and feel. Once more, it really is just about the score. And yet for numerous reasons familiarity is yet to breed staleness. This will be the first meeting between City and Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium in 17 months, the first there for more than three years to be soundtracked by the noise and songs of fans, rather than the hollow clatter of empty plastic seats in the wind. They will meet on Sunday afternoon, and then again at Wembley in the FA Cup semi-final next Saturday, and possibly for a third time in Paris in the Champions League final in May. Things are about to get intimate. Perhaps even a little rancorous. For all their mutual admiration on a professional level, there is no great personal warmth between Guardiola and Klopp. After all, for all their similarities they are hugely contrasting personalities: Pep the brooding introvert and Jürgen the beaming extrovert; Pep the gnomic genius whose mind remains essentially unknowable, Jürgen the motormouth who can’t help but tell you what he’s thinking. Klopp gets that football is not real life. Guardiola gets that, actually, it kind of is. Throw these guys into a full‑scale, triple-trophy fist fight, and don’t be surprised if one or both eventually cracks. For the fans, too, this has become an unusually pointed and bitter conflict, from Liverpool’s ambush of the City team bus before their Champions League fixture in 2018 to City’s frequent complaints of pro-Liverpool bias among the footballing authorities, referees, the media. This in itself is a reasonably new development. The Wikipedia page devoted to the rivalry was created in late 2019. And yet at the heart of the tribal malice between Liverpool and City fans is an insoluble paradox: the idea that whether it be City’s state-backed money or Liverpool’s history and tradition, they alone are the courageous underdog insurgents railing against The Power. The paradox being that for all their strong sense of anti‑establishment identity, City and Liverpool are essentially the establishment now. Both were part of last year’s soiled Super League breakaway. Both are among the seven richest clubs in the world, even if the source of City’s revenue remains a source of considerable controversy. In footballing and financial terms, from pressing to scouting, from culture to commercial instinct, they are the exemplary models, the template of how to build a super‑club. Guardiola and Klopp will be the most sought-after coaches in the game when they finally call it a day in the north-west. In their own ways, City and Liverpool are the ultimate expression of modern football, for better and for worse. As for the game itself: well, who knows? How brave do Liverpool feel? What attacking combination will Guardiola go with? How will Liverpool’s defence cope against a team that will force it to defend more than any other? Has Mohamed Salah rediscovered his form? Do Liverpool have the deeper bench these days? A taut, cautious draw is the likeliest result, followed by the City win that would probably kill off the title race, followed by the Liverpool win that would put them two points clear with seven games remaining. What feels certain is that something will break here, something will end here, one way or the other. The pressure is simply too high, the stakes too irredeemable, the margins of error too fine. Both sides are relatively free of injuries. The recent international break means they will be well rested. No hiding place, and no excuses. And yet, as much as this feels like a dynastic era in English football, we are probably already nearer its end than its beginning. Klopp has been at Anfield for six and a half years; Guardiola at the Etihad for almost six. The City v Liverpool rivalry meant little before they arrived and will probably go back to meaning little after they depart. All the more reason, then, to cherish this fleeting alignment of the fates: to revel in the sort of game that tells us not merely where football is right now, but where it might be heading.",Sport/Football,Guardiola and Klopp have built a duel worthy of status as English clásico | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/08/manchester-city-liverpool-pep-guardiola-jurgen-klopp-managers-clasico
4/9/2022,"First, she won races that no female jockey had won before. Next, she crossed off career-defining achievements for any rider, in any generation. And on Saturday, when she rides Minella Times in the Grand National at Aintree, Rachael Blackmore could move on to the once-a-century stuff. Tony McCoy, in 1997, was the last jockey before Blackmore to win the Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup at the same Cheltenham Festival, so it is 25 years since there has been any need to delve through National Hunt’s history books, to confirm whether a jockey has ever won the Grand National too in the same season. Go right back to the sport’s earliest days, when the Champion Hurdle itself was in its infancy, and you will find that the answer is one: Tommy Cullinan, in 1930, who completed the set of jumping’s crown jewels at Aintree on Shaun Goilin, a chance ride after his original mount, the great Easter Hero, picked up an injury. Ninety-two years later, and in a far more competitive era, Blackmore is nine-and-a-half minutes away from completing a quickfire treble that has eluded National Hunt’s greatest riders ever since. And if Minella Times can reprise his winning performance 12 months ago – becoming only the fourth dual winner since 1899 in the process – a full house of 70,000 spectators will be at Aintree to give horse and rider the reception they deserve. It was an eerie and, in all honesty, a somewhat deflating experience to witness Blackmore’s historic success in front of empty grandstands 12 months ago. More than any other race, the Grand National is about the shared experience, for those at the course and the hundreds of millions watching around the world. Without the noise and delirious excitement that takes over as the 40 runners line up for the most intense 10 minutes of action in any sport, it could only be a pale imitation of an event that has captured the public’s imagination for the best part of 200 years. Blackmore, of course, was too caught up in the moment, the one that every jump jockey has dreamed about since childhood, to allow the near-silence to rub the polish from her day. But it left a faint sense of unfinished business that would be consigned to history with a victory on Saturday. “It’s hard to imagine what winning it again would feel like until it actually happens, to be honest,” Blackmore said this week. “My mum and sister are coming over on Saturday morning and they’re really looking forward to it, so it will be great to have them here and there are plenty of friends as well that are coming too. “You just can’t compare that feeling of crossing the line, it was just a phenomenal feeling and it’s a race that every kid wants to ride in. When you’re growing up, this is the race that captures your imagination and it’s just very special to be able to say that you’ve won it. I’ve definitely seen the replay of last year’s race more times than I can count. “There’s definitely a massive global reach and I really felt that after last year. The media attention after Cheltenham last year [where Blackmore was the first female rider to finish as the meeting’s top jockey] was massive, but after the Grand National it just seemed to explode again. It seems to reach parts of the world that no other races do.” Last month’s success in the Cheltenham Gold Cup meant that Blackmore is now the only current jockey in the weighing room to have won the Big Three races, and she completed the set in little more than a year. That tells the story of her career as a whole, the years spent struggling for a breakthrough before multiple Grade One winners arrived one after another at a dizzying pace. Blackmore could be unseated at the first on Saturday and remain a global sporting phenomenon. “When you go into a random clothes shop in Dublin and you’re dressed in normal clothes and someone comes up to you, that is mad,” she said. “It’s one thing people coming up to you at the races because you’re dressed like a jockey and people can place you, but the odd time you’re in a situation like that is something that didn’t happen 12 months ago. “I’ve got loads of fanmail since last year, from both girls and boys. A lot of times I know the teacher in school is setting out an assignment of writing to someone you admire as I get a bundle of letters, so it’s obviously on the school curriculum somewhere. It’s brilliant and it’s great that it’s sparking an interest in kids, and hopefully that helps them.” This being the National, of course, there are other storylines to fire the punters’ imagination, not least the possibility that Snow Leopardess, a magnificent front-running grey, will become the first mare to win the race after becoming a mother.

4/9/2022,"Beth Mead scored four, bagging her third hat-trick of England’s World Cup qualifying campaign, and Ellen White became the second player to reach 50 goals for England as the Lionesses beat North Macedonia 10-0 in Skopje. Manchester United forward Ella Toone also scored three and Georgia Stanway struck either side of the break as England ran riot against the team they beat 8-0 in the reverse fixture. Sarina Wiegman had said she wanted to “create lots of chances, be very secure on the ball, score lots of goals – and concede none” and although the score line was favourable, the Lionesses weren’t quite as clinical as they perhaps should have been against a team positioned 124 places below them in the Fifa world rankings – the team’s 10 goals coming from 35 shots to North Macedonia’s one and 81% of the possession. Nevertheless, with the glow of Skopje’s 66m high Millennium Cross on top of the Vodno mountain hovering above the swooping roof of the Toše Proeski Arena that mirrored its curve, England were five goals ahead at the close of the first half. And they had done so without a host of key players, with captain Leah Williamson out following concussion protocol and defenders Alex Greenwood and Lotte Wubben-Moy left behind with knee and thigh injuries respectively, resulting in the late inclusion of the Everton centre-back Gabby George. Partnering Bright in the centre of defence was Chelsea teammate Jess Carter, but there was little to be concerned about as the pair had very little to do. It took just five minutes for England to take the lead, but they could have been ahead already, with White whipping a header from a Lauren Hemp cross wide in the second minute. Hemp was the provider for the opener, delivering a similar ball from the left which was missed by White before being powered in at the far post by Mead. Mead would score England’s second, latching onto a neat pass from Stanway before dinking a cross-cum-shot over goalkeeper Viktorija Panchurova and into the side netting from a tight angle. Midway through the half Toone added another, embarking on a driving run before lashing beyond Panchurova from the edge of the box. Having missed a host of chances, including clipping a header off the top of the bar, White finally grabbed her 50th England goal, taking her clear of Bobby Charlton and Harry Kane’s tallies and to within three of Wayne Rooney’s record. Shortly after, Hemp cut back to Stanway in the middle and the Manchester City midfielder hammered home. There was a small but vocal crowd boosted by contrasting clusters of Macedonian children and small groups of British Nato forces among the families and friends of players. While the latter group roared on the unfamiliar players in white with gusto, there were also unfortunately some unsavoury words directed towards the pitch. Shortly after the break, Mead grabbed her hat-trick, sending the ball into the corner from eight yards out then, added her fourth six minutes later, pouncing on the rebound after Panchurova did well to push away Hemp’s strike. Two minutes later, Stanway added the eighth, collecting Hemp’s pass with her back to goal before swivelling and drilling low into the net. Toone scored her second in the 73rd minute from close range, before securing her second senior hat-trick to take England into double figures four minutes later – her first coming in England’s recent 10-0 defeat of Latvia in Riga. England now head to Belfast, where they will face a sterner test in this summer’s Euros Group A opponents Northern Ireland. Ranked 46th in the world, they have sold out Windsor Park for the visit of the Lionesses.
