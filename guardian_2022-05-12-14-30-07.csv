5/12/2022,"Women and babies in the UK are “dying needlessly” because of a lack of suitable medicines to use in pregnancy, according to a report that calls for a radical overhaul of maternal health. A “profound” shortage of research and the widespread exclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women from clinical trials means hardly any new drugs are approved for common medical problems in pregnancy or soon after childbirth, the report finds. Meanwhile, scarce or contradictory information about the safety of existing medicines women may be taking for continuing conditions can make it impossible to reach a confident decision on whether or not to continue them in pregnancy, the experts add. “While pregnancy in the UK is generally considered safe, women and babies are still dying needlessly as a direct result of preventable pregnancy complications,” the authors say. Each year, 5,000 babies in the UK are either stillborn or die shortly after birth, while about 70 women die of complications in pregnancy. The Healthy Mum, Healthy Baby, Healthy Future report is published by a policy commission co-chaired by Eliza Manningham-Buller, the co-president of Chatham House, and Peter Brocklehurst, a professor of women’s health at the University of Birmingham. Drawing on evidence from patient groups, clinicians, researchers, lawyers, insurance specialists and the pharmaceutical industry, it proposes “urgent” changes to transform women’s access to modern medicine. Brocklehurst said the issue needed tackling with the same energy thrown into the early HIV crisis, when massive investment and effort went into the search for therapies. “We need to mobilise that same enthusiasm and investment towards pregnancy to develop some effective medications because we’ve simply not been touching pregnancy,” he said. Globally, more than 800 women and nearly 7,000 newborns die each day from pregnancy-related complications, with about 5,500 babies stillborn. The vast majority of these are preventable, with pre-eclampsia, premature birth, haemorrhage, infection and birth asphyxia accounting for most of the deaths. The report highlights a host of failures that hamper the development and approval of medicines for pregnant women. They range from the exclusion of pregnant women from clinical trials and poor information on existing medicines to woeful funding of pregnancy research and a fear of legal action if treatments on trial prove harmful. Pregnant woman have been almost entirely excluded from clinical trials since the thalidomide tragedy in the 1950s. But while caution was understandable in the wake of the disaster, the move has led to “unintended and grave consequences” for pregnant women who are “left without safe, effective and accessible medicines”, the authors write. In the past 40 years, only two new drugs have been approved for use in pregnancy. The problem was evident in the pandemic when pregnant women were excluded on safety grounds from all early Covid vaccine trials. This fuelled uncertainty around the safety of the vaccines for pregnant women, the authors write, contributing to Covid wards and intensive care units filling up with unvaccinated pregnant women. The report goes on to highlight the “profound lack of research activity” and up-to-date information that leaves pregnant women and their physicians in the dark about whether to continue with certain medicines in pregnancy. Some epilepsy drugs, for example, can increase the risk of birth defects, but coming off them can put the woman at risk of severe seizures, which can also harm the baby. Lady Manningham-Buller said the situation “urgently needs to change”, with the report setting out eight recommendations to prevent needless deaths. The authors say charities and other organisations must work together to provide robust advocacy for medicines in pregnancy, while companies should be given incentives to produce new drugs, such as extending patent licences. Meanwhile clinical trials should be open to pregnant and breastfeeding women, with tests for safety in pregnancy perhaps a compulsory requirement for many new drugs. Other recommendations are to provide clear, updated information on the safety of existing medicines in pregnancy, and to “de-risk” clinical trials so pharmaceutical companies are not deterred by potential litigation. “If we can arrange insurance for terrorism we should be able to produce a similar scheme for pregnant women,” said Manningham-Buller, a former director general of MI5. “The biggest killer of women and babies around the world is still pre-eclampsia for mothers and babies and preterm birth for babies. And we’ve got very little that makes a difference,” said Brocklehurst. “We could make a massive difference in a relatively short space of time if there was sufficient investment and desire to do work in this field.”",News/Society,Lack of drugs for use in pregnancy ‘resulting in needless deaths’ in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/12/lack-of-drugs-for-use-in-pregnancy-resulting-in-needless-deaths-in-uk
5/12/2022,"When I zipped up my tent on my first night sleeping rough, I felt no despair. It was 2013 and I had picked a grassy patch near a bridle path, where I listened to the wind rustling through the trees as raindrops bounced off my nylon roof. I had always assumed something like this was going to happen to me. It had felt almost inevitable for years. When viewed in isolation, my journey to the streets seems entirely of my own making. I had racked up considerable rent arrears, I was drinking heavily and I had left my flat without being evicted. I went to live in a tent and on random sofas for a few weeks, before moving into a charitable homeless hostel. Surely it was all my fault? I wish I could say I was forced on to the streets by an unscrupulous landlord, addiction to hard drugs or something more dramatic, but sloth, shame and overwhelming paranoia were what did it. It was as if I needed to check out, to yield to a tide that was out of my control, to let it wash me up where it wanted. But the more I dug into my journey, the more it became clear that I had been failed repeatedly along the way – from the special-education boarding school to the care home, the police, the precarious jobs and the effects of austerity. Some will be surprised that I am writing this – alongside a book – at all. People with my background don’t normally make it into print. But this is my story. In 1997, when I was 11, my key worker entered my classroom and presented me with a small, green paper parcel, which she unfurled, revealing a thick, white powder. I leaned forward and gathered as much of it as I could with my tongue, making sure not to miss a speck. I was told the bitter taste in my mouth was going to make me better; make me good. The classroom was in a special-education boarding school – let’s call it Dippydale – for children with learning, emotional and behavioural difficulties. I was there because, since as soon as I could form memories, I had been told there was something wrong with me – and they had a point. The psychiatrist who diagnosed me with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) when I was seven didn’t need to strain his diagnostic skills. During our first session, I did my best Spider-Man impression on his bookshelves when I was supposed to be arranging a series of simple pictures into logical sequences. I burned all my bridges with mainstream education, so, at 11, I ended up at Dippydale. The school was in the middle of nowhere, on the foreboding West Pennine Moors. Emotional outbursts, fights and restraints routinely disrupted teaching. The soundtrack to the school’s corridors was: “Get the fuck off me, now!” The favoured restraint was known as the B-52. It involved lining up three chairs next to each other and plonking an unfortunate child on the middle chair, with two members of staff flanking them, locking the child’s arms across their laps with one hand and pushing the child’s head down with the other. It was named after the bomber presumably because the contorted child resembled a plane. Restraints were a rite of passage at the school and I soon had my turn. I had enuresis (I wet the bed). There were four boys to a room in the boarding house, so it was impossible to hide this embarrassing problem. My key worker at the time – let’s call him Mr Lanky – thought he could remedy this by waltzing into my bedroom every morning before my roommates had awoken to ask me if I was dry – only he would spell it out, as if that would keep it secret. “Are you D-R-Y?” he would ask. We might have been div kids, but we could still spell – and smell. I didn’t need excuses to distract myself from schoolwork and behave badly, but the bullying gave me some anyway. My first B-52 came after I refused to go back inside after breaktime over petty frustrations on the football pitch. I was dragged back into the music room by two teachers and restrained. I knew all the lyrics to the school’s soundtrack by this point and belted them out with furious gusto: “Get the fuck off me now, you bastards!” I was so upset and helpless as I sat there, immobilised in pain, that I spat on the floor in frustration. A third teacher, who was standing over me, took a tissue, gathered up my spittle and wiped it over my face. I didn’t think much of the restraints at the time; they were like clockwork at school. Now, I perceive them almost as injustices that happened to someone else, a little boy I knew a long time ago. A 2016 study funded by the National Institutes of Health in the US found that ADHD substantially increased the risk of homelessness. The study tracked 134 boys aged between six and 12 diagnosed with ADHD in the 1970s. When they caught up with the boys three decades later, they found that 24% of them had been homeless, more than five times the rate for a control group of neurotypical children. Like me, many homeless adults start on their route to destitution in childhood. According to a 2018 survey conducted by Evolve Housing, a London-based homeless charity, 79% of the 156 participants reported at least one childhood trauma. While Evolve stops short of claiming there is a causal link between childhood trauma and homelessness, it does say there is “a disproportionally high level of those experiencing homelessness following traumatic childhood experiences”. Even if there is no causal link, I was about to add to the neurological disorder and trauma via a different conduit to homelessness. Inever thought I would go into care. It seemed like a horror story, an abstraction exclusive to fictional characters or people in the news. But by the time I reached the front door of my new foster home, my life was spiralling from one catastrophe to the next. This was just the latest one. As well as my disrupted education and bad behaviour, my mum’s budding relationship with my new stepdad was adding to tensions at home. He and I now get on. He is my dad, I love him and that’s that. But our relationship has been fraught over the years. Dad was an entertaining chastiser. He had a series of greatest hits that could have filled a double-sided compilation album: Now That’s What I Call a Bollocking. My all-time favourite was when he told me off for relentlessly teasing my brother on one hyperactive afternoon at my grandma’s house: “Now listen, boy, and listen well!” he growled. “You’re nine years old now; you’re halfway to being 18!” He was halfway to being 60 at the time, so by his logic we should have been preparing for his retirement. Looking back, I don’t blame my parents. I was a little bastard at the best of times and my parents, who had problems of their own and were offered little support from social services, were not equipped to cope. Children in care are more likely to leave school with fewer qualifications than children who remain at home. They are more likely to be unemployed, to have mental illness and to enter the criminal justice system. It is almost as if the care system trains children for destitution. After a year in the system, I was expelled from Dippydale and finished my secondary education at 15, with no qualifications. In the same year, I had my first run-in with the police. The staff had already lost control of the kids under their charge before I arrived at a claustrophobic children’s home in Manchester. Bad behaviour went unpunished or was penalised inconsistently. All this taught us was that we could do what we wanted and there would be no penalties until things got so out of hand that the police had to be called. Then, instead of a grounding or a dock in pocket money, we earned a criminal record. The first time I got nicked, I and a few other kids decided that breaking furniture and shouting abuse at the staff was preferable to going to bed. Aside from exhaustion, police intervention was probably the only thing that would have stopped us that night. But a 999 call could have been avoided if the staff weren’t so inconsistent and incompetent. I ended up in handcuffs on several occasions after that, once for breaking a mug. Often the police would come just to make sure we went to bed. The little respect we had for the staff disappeared as soon as they had us criminalised; rebelling against them became our raison d’etre. It all came to a head on one sunny summer afternoon. Lucy, who was 14 and the only girl living at the home, was visited by Hamza, her 18-year-old boyfriend. He was hanging around with her on the front doorstep. Lucy wanted to come back into the unit for a drink, but the staff told her she couldn’t come in if Hamza was still on the premises. He refused to go. Lucy shouted obscenities through the letterbox: “Let me in, you fuckin’ dick’eds; it’s my house, yeah?” she said, cackling. “Yo, Danny! Carter! Let us in, man!” Not wanting to miss out on the fun, Carter, the lanky “top boy” of the unit, and I obliged. Two male staff members were on that day. Let’s call them Gramps (he had a white beard) and Titch (he was tiny). Meanwhile, Joyless (she was mean) was manning the office. Titch put his hand on the door to try to keep it shut, but Carter managed to overpower him. Gramps had been blocking my path, but when Carter got the door open, Gramps rushed over to shut it, giving me enough space to slip past him and over the threshold. The staff locked the door behind us and shook their heads in disgust as we flipped them off from outside. Hamza distracted us from tormenting the staff when he produced the gun he had brought along. I don’t know if it was real, but it looked real enough, and Hamza got nervous when we turned the barrel on Titch and Gramps through the window. Things went on like this for a while until we grew bored and wanted to come back in. The staff insisted we enter one at a time, but as soon as they opened the door for me to go in, an almighty scuffle broke out as Hamza and Carter attempted to force their way inside with me. Gramps had Hamza in a chokehold, while Carter had Titch in a clinch and was thrusting his knee sharply, relentlessly, into Titch’s face. Eventually, Titch crumpled to the floor. Carter then rushed outside and attempted to pick up one of the boulders lying on a flower bed close to the entrance. “Why aren’t you doing anything, you pussy?” he shouted to me as I stood there, frozen. He couldn’t lift the boulder and went for a fire extinguisher near the door instead. Hamza had managed to wriggle free before Carter could put the extinguisher to use, but a flurry of punches and kicks followed, then sirens. Carter, Lucy and Hamza fled past me. I was still rooted to the spot, staring in disbelief at Gramps and Titch’s unconscious, bloodied bodies. “C’mon!” Carter shouted as he dragged me away. I found my feet and sprinted after them. The air was filled with deafening sirens – and they were for us. We ran as fast as we could, for as long as we could – longer than we had ever run before. When we stopped – when we could no longer hear sirens – it felt like my whole body had become engorged and my tongue was made of copper. Carter and I watched Hamza and Lucy make their way up a long, dark street with red-brick terrace houses on either side. They stopped at one near the end and were invited in after a brief chat at the front door. Hamza looked at us and shook his head apologetically as he crossed the threshold with Lucy. By now, it was getting dark. The uniformity of the red terraces under the ugly orange streetlamps was the perfect backdrop for our bleak circumstances. “We could go to my gran’s house,” I suggested to Carter. “Yeah? Where does she live?” he said. “Greenfield,” I said. Carter managed a laugh. “Nah. Mission, that.” “What are we gonna do then?” I asked. “Go back,” he said. Carter started walking. “If we go back, we’ll get lifted,” I said. “I’ll get lifted. Fuck all’s gonna ’appen to you,” he said. “How do you know?” I asked. “Because I know! You didn’t do owt, did you?” We didn’t talk much on the way home. The adrenaline that kept us on our toes for more than four miles had sapped from our bodies and left cold reality behind. We knew Carter had ruined his life; the slow march home felt like a funeral procession. We arrived back and I knocked on the door as Carter took a seat on the bottom rung of the railings that ran along the front-door steps, the same place where all the drama began. Joyless came to the door with Biker (he commuted by bike from Halifax), a stout thirtysomething care worker for whom no one had much time. Joyless was wearing a look of revulsion as she appeared at the door. “Just you,” she said to me. I looked back at Carter. “Told you. Go on,” he said. What began as defiance of the rules, broken curfews, midnight pantry raids and abusive tantrums escalated to criminal damage and grievous bodily harm in a matter of months. It didn’t have to be this way. Government guidelines say that the police should not be used to manage low-level behaviour problems or matters that a “reasonable parent” would not have called the police about. When children go into care, it is invariably because their family situation has broken down. After this happens, the state becomes the parent and is responsible for their welfare. My experience was two decades ago, but criminalisation is still common in the care system. It is not surprising that about 27% of the prison population comprises care-leavers when practically everyone I lived with in care finished their time with a criminal record. Even though Carter, Lucy and I didn’t know it yet, our behaviour would shape our futures and make lives embroiled in poverty, crime and destitution almost certain. When I left care, I had already lived at 14 addresses. I would bounce between council flats and bedsits another seven times before I ended up in that tent. Many of the mistakes I have made are my own, but I can’t help thinking that if social services had handled my transition to independence better, if readiness – instead of the arbitrariness of age – determined when care leavers could stand on their own two feet, maybe I would have made something of my life sooner. When I was 21, I worked a full-time job and took night classes. In 2010, I made it to university. But I couldn’t look after myself. I struggled to budget and keep a routine and was generally disorganised, my attention always anywhere but the present. By the end of my third year, with care support long gone, I was firmly in the grip of mental illness and dependency. My grandparents, to whom I was close, had died over those three years and one of my best friends died suddenly, too; my mother was hospitalised with multiple organ failure; and some of my immediate family members were struggling with substance abuse and were in trouble with the police (one was placed in a psychiatric ward). All of this caused me to withdraw into myself. Towards the end of my degree, in May 2013, I was in thousands of pounds of arrears and became paranoid about debt collectors visiting me. It was this that made me resort to pitching a tent. After 18 months bouncing around the hostel system, I managed to pull myself together enough to complete a master’s degree and become a journalist – I have even won a few awards. But if your take from this is that I am living proof that upward mobility is all about grit and determination, then you should know that I am a walking, talking anomaly. Almost everyone I know from the system is damaged. They are off the map, in prison or dead. Things have not improved. According to analysis by WPI Economics for the charities St Mungo’s and Homeless Link, spending by English local authorities on homelessness-related activity fell by 27% between 2008-09 and 2017-18. During this time, the number of rough sleepers more than doubled. It is true that people like me are more likely to become homeless at some point in their lives, but the fact is that homelessness can happen to almost anyone. You may have had a perfect paint-by-numbers existence: good schools, straight As, a glowing career, a flourishing social life and a supportive family. Then, one day, you are blindsided by illness, redundancy, a relationship breakdown, a rogue landlord or some other unforeseen circumstance and find yourself on your arse. If we want to end housing insecurity and eliminate endemic homelessness, we must embark on a radical and comprehensive social housebuilding programme. In the past five years, I have lived in four properties across London. One of those was a temporary placement; in two others, I had to leave due to dishonest landlords. At the time of writing, I am living in another box in south-east London. I don’t have many possessions and the walls of the box remain pasty and bare. Decorating seems futile. At the back of my mind, I know I can never settle; the next eviction letter is on the horizon and will soon be in my face, propelling me into another frantic race against time to find my next four walls. I worry that I will fail this time, that I will get the letter during a pinch and will have to go through all of this again.

5/12/2022,"He only knew it was serious when the hate mail began. Up until then, neither Matthew Katzman nor his friends thought what they’d done was that big a deal. But now he was getting abuse in his inbox, over WhatsApp, on social media. Every few minutes, a fresh load landed. “BIG NOSED UGLY FUCK GO KILL YOURSELF” “Wouldn’t be stupid enough to stay in the country.” “Twitter needs to do its stuff and locate where he is hiding.” Even as he walked home, his phone was humming with threats. And he was scared. It was the early days of last June. Without his knowledge and against his will, Matthew had been conscripted into that very modern British phenomenon: a culture war. The day that was ending in public hate had begun with a deluge of press. From the Times and the Telegraph to the Sun and the Mail, the papers claimed the American student had “cancelled the Queen”, whipping up a woke mob at Oxford’s Magdalen College to ban her picture from their common room. They slapped his name on the front pages, while decorating their inside spreads with personal photos scraped from his social media. Then the government took the baton. Then-education secretary Gavin Williamson slammed the move as “simply absurd”, while Jacob Rees-Mogg singled out Katzman in the Commons as “a pimply adolescent”. Even the prime minister joined in. Never mind that the American was no adolescent, but 25. Forget that Williamson had responded to the Salisbury poisonings of 2018 by telling the Russian state to “go away and shut up”, which really was absurd. So well-timed were these interventions, a cynic might believe they had been precision-targeted to keep the story running. And what a story it was. As culture conflagrations go, this one had it all: an ancient university, bolshie twentysomethings denouncing the monarchy, the implication that British history was anything but a glorious pageant. No wonder some of the highest-paid names in British journalism lined up to give a computing student 3,000 miles from home their best kicking. From Rod Liddle to Jenni Murray, all agreed that if this Yank didn’t like it he should go back where he came from. This was a theme the unpaid hate-mailers kept harping on: “Your toxic identity and victim politics aren’t wanted here.”Piers Morgan begged Joe Biden to “drop the whiny insolent brat somewhere over the Atlantic”. Dan Wootton thundered: “Would this rabble-rouser disrespect his own country like this?” The Mail’s resident thinker also didn’t care for Katzman’s PhD in “complexity theory”, which is actually a branch of maths, but never mind. For the record, Wootton hails from New Zealand, where he did media studies and politics. And Morgan often drones on about how much he values free speech and others’ opinions. For the pundits and the politicians it was all good lucrative fun. Except the story was largely manufactured, and the consequences for Katzman have been devastating. Apart from a brief interview with the Daily Telegraph at the start of the storm and a statement normally buried right at the bottom of news reports, the student at its very eye has not been heard from at all – until he agreed to speak to me. His account of the events of last summer demands to be read by anyone who cares about this country’s media and political culture. And it has a nasty resonance in the week in which the main opposition party was blindsided by accusations over, of all things, a takeaway curry. For a start, it was not a portrait of the Queen, but a cheap print of a photo that had only been tacked up a few years earlier. Nor did Magdalen ban all royal pictures – the college still has plenty on display. This was pointed out at the time but often conveniently ignored. Katzman wasn’t even, to quote the Times “behind the removal”. Most of the main points of the story had been stretched to breaking point. Slight and quietly spoken, Katzman doesn’t fit the Mail’s notion of a “student show-off”. He enjoys strategy board games and has a puppy called Rusty. And up until his notoriety, he had been president of the postgraduates’ middle common room (MCR), dealing with student kitchens and their bins. Before last June’s meeting, he was presented with a motion from an MCR subcommittee asking for the removal of the picture of the Queen. Katzman redrafted the motion, playing down its accusation of colonialism. Instead, he wrote that those associations made some students uncomfortable. His name was appended as a formality, yet at a sparsely attended meeting, he neither spoke for the motion nor supported it. Seventeen students voted, only two opposed. The rest of the evening was spent discussing, among other things, garden furniture and a leaving gift for a college librarian. There was no rendition of the Marseillaise, no blood-curdling cries for the guillotine. In the name of making people feel welcome in their own common room, a fairly small print was removed from a modestly sized room inside a building that is off-limits to the public. No harm was done to anyone. But the event itself did not matter. All that counted was the story told about it. Through all of 2018, according to research published this week by King’s College London, the expression “cancel culture” appeared in just six newspaper articles in the UK. By last year, the term featured in 3,670 pieces. For news organisations that rely on web traffic for their revenues, it has become a vital phrase: a way of catching fitful attention and generating clicks that attract advertising. The Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday account for nearly one in four of all uses. Students at that meeting didn’t think they were cancelling anyone – because they weren’t. But the professionals in the press and government weren’t going to spurn a gift. When he saw those front pages, Katzman’s first reaction was disbelief. “This must be the most trivial news story that has ever been written.” But then he saw the pictures and read the details about his family. He began to get very anxious. He had been turned into that week’s target for the right’s two-minute hate. This young man who doesn’t identify as woke or radical, and for whom marching means playing a trumpet in a band – he would be the focus of national bile. Sure enough, hate mail began pouring in. Much of it was abusive, some was directly racist. “Jewish bolshevik. Communist cunt.” Worried over his physical safety, Magdalen moved him and his girlfriend into one of their rooms, from which they didn’t emerge for five days. Five days in which Katzman barely slept or ate, but just kept worrying. Not long after he returned to his family and friends in the US. He came back to Oxford that autumn, but couldn’t stay. The place brought back memories of his hounding and strangers would treat him as either a celebrity or a monster. He lives in the US now and does his PhD there. He didn’t cancel the Queen, but the British right cancelled him. It is often said that the challenge for progressive politicians and activists in this country is to play the media game. To eat that bacon sandwich more elegantly, or ditch that donkey jacket. To sound reasonable and put on a shirt and tie. But the moral of Katzman’s tale is that one can be blameless – and if the right want to find blame, they will. A computing whiz-kid at a top university – how much better does it get? A top student looking after others amid the trauma of lockdown. None of it counts in your favour, if the press don’t favour you. Katzman still thinks about what happened most days, and it fills him with rage. The dishonesty with which the press and ministers presented him; their disinterest in finding out what actually happened. All that hot air about English fair play counted for nothing and all those venerable institutions failed him. “The journalists and politicians who trashed me were doing it for their own ends: to get a headline or to get paid,” he says. “Well, congratulations! Because they all won. They didn’t care about what it did to me.”  Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist",Opinion/Opinion,Hate mail and death threats: how the right wrecked one man’s life for its culture war | Aditya Chakrabortty,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/12/hate-mail-death-threats-culture-war-matthew-katzman-cancelling-queen
5/12/2022,"Client meetings and emails could be picked up alongside a pint of milk and a box of eggs under a new deal between Tesco and flexible office operator IWG. From later this month, the owner of office operator Regus is to test out a 3,800 sq ft flexible working area within Tesco’s New Malden supermarket, with room for 12 private desks, 30 co-working spaces and a meeting room. The tie-up emerges as supermarkets look for new ways to fill space in stores where they once sold electrical goods, music or films now largely bought digitally. It is thought likely that Tesco will open more flexible offer space if the idea proves popular. Louise Goodland, head of strategic partnerships at Tesco said: “We are pleased to be working with IWG to offer customers the chance to work more flexibly from their local Tesco. We are always looking to serve our customers and communities better and we will be interested to see how they respond to this new opportunity.” The office venture, called Spaces, will join other Tesco partners including sports equipment seller Decathlon, Pets at Home, InPost parcel lockers, Holland & Barrett health food stores and the likes of Timpson and Vision Express, which have sprung up to fill spare supermarket space. The deal also reflects a boom in flexible working space spurred on by months of pandemic restrictions that forced businesses to get more comfortable with allowing employees to work from home or elsewhere. Facilities are springing up on local high streets and in redundant space in shopping centres, cinemas and airports as many businesses downsize their permanent office space permanently and allow workers to dial in from somewhere handier. Electrical goods retailer Currys, for example, recently announced a deal under which more than 1,000 of its head office staff can use more than 50 sites run by rival office specialist WeWork in the UK. As much as 30% of the UK office market could be made up of flexible space by 2030, according to property advisory firm JLL, compared with far less than 10% at present. Research by IWG found that 72% of workers would prefer the ability to work flexibly, over returning to the office five days a week. Mark Dixon, the founder and chief executive of IWG, said: “People don’t want to spend hours commuting every day and instead want to live and work in their local communities. A Tesco Extra in a suburban location, in the middle of a vibrant local community, is the perfect location for flexible office space. “New locations in suburban areas will transform communities and are a response to the growing demand we are seeing from customers who want to live and work locally.” IWG, which operates about 300 offices in the UK, is set to open neighbourhood working spaces in Twickenham, Sutton and the revamped Battersea Power Station, all in London this year. Upmarket rival Fora, which has 14 locations, is planning six more and is planning to merge with The Office Group, which operates from 44 buildings and has six more under construction.",News/Business,Meeting now in aisle 14: Tesco pilots in-store flexible office space,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/tesco-pilots-in-store-flexible-office-space-london-supermarket-iwg-tie-up
5/12/2022,"Environmental tipping points are fast approaching in the UK, the Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) has said. Potential tipping points – where gradual decline suddenly becomes catastrophic – include loss of wildlife, fisheries collapse and dead, polluted rivers, the watchdog said. The OEP is a new official body set up after Brexit to hold the government to account. Its first report, published on Thursday, says ministers have shown ambition but that action is too slow. The government launched a 25-year environment plan in 2018, but the OEP says persistent and worrying declines continue and minister must take the opportunities provided by the new Environment Act to implement urgent and coherent measures. “We’re asking the government to recognise that tipping points are fast approaching in some areas. Because if it doesn’t, it’s going to be so much harder,” said Dame Glenys Stacey, the OEP chair. “When you get to very limited numbers [of wildlife species], the effort involved in turning that around is immense and takes an awful long time.” She highlighted ongoing damage to marine wildlife. “Progress there has been stately at best. But the government can, in large part, arrest these adverse trends, if it has the will.” Stacey added: “A sustainable environment is not just nice to have but essential for human wellbeing, progress and prosperity. Turning the tide to achieve this is exceptionally difficult, yet it is needed urgently for our wealth, health and wellbeing, and absolutely essential for the generations to come. “The first 25-year environment plan was an ambitious attempt to confront the challenges facing the environment, but progress towards delivering that ambition has been too slow. “We continue to see worrying and persistent trends of environmental decline. But with the Environment Act, the government has a precious opportunity.” Simon Brockington, the OEP’s chief insights officer, said: “A tipping point arises at the point where a very slow and persistent decline suddenly becomes catastrophic. We’re seeing long-term declines in biodiversity and we’re calling on the government to address those. The serial setting of catch quotas above catch limits over time can lead to fish stock crash and we’ve seen many examples of that.” He also highlighted seabed trawling, which he said “destroys the integrity of the ecosystem”, and the pollution of farmland and rivers with fertilisers and livestock manure. “For tipping points, it would be those I would highlight,” he said. Natalie Prosser, the watchdog’s chief executive, said the UK was one of the most biodiversity-depleted countries in the world, and air pollution caused tens of thousands of deaths a year. “Changes in climate are affecting the environment and biodiversity. We are heading towards a major tipping point.” She said the government had missed many environmental targets, and funding for monitoring the environment had fallen in the last 10 years. The OEP report identifies six “building blocks” needed to rescue the environment in the UK, including a comprehensive stocktake of the state of nature, a commitment to action from all government departments, long-term legally binding targets and accountability for delivering those targets. “The building blocks need to be firmer, clearer and weightier and pursued with true determination and intent,” Stacey said. “A lot of environmental trends take decades to become apparent and there are always more immediate pressures for government. So if we’re not careful, the environment can always be second fiddle. We’ll rue the day that we don’t take stock and address that.” Richard Benwell, the head of Wildlife and Countryside Link, a coalition of 65 nature and conservation charities, said: “It has been 10 years since the government promised to pass on the environment in better condition – 10 years in which biodiversity has continued to decline. The OEP poses a simple challenge: that overarching ambition must now be rooted in ambitious targets and an urgent delivery strategy.” Joan Edwards, of the Wildlife Trusts, said: “For all the initial promise of the 25-year environment plan, the government has been seriously dragging its feet. Targets for reversing nature’s decline are so unambitious that in 20 years’ time we could have even less wildlife than we have now. The steps outlined by the OEP provide a framework for government to deliver on its promises, but we need much greater political willpower.” Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: “We welcome this report, which acknowledges that our Environment Act gives us new tools to make a real difference to our environment, putting it at the heart of government and transitioning us to a sustainable future with nature on the road to recovery during this decade. We are currently consulting on legally binding environmental targets, which include a world-leading target to halt species decline by 2030.”",News/Environment,"Environment tipping points fast approaching in UK, says watchdog",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/12/environment-tipping-points-fast-approaching-in-uk-says-watchdog
5/12/2022,"“This is really exciting,” says Ealing resident Alafair Celestine as she surveys a shopfront just off the local high street where the black-painted boarded-up windows of the former Karma Club don’t immediately appear to justify her comments. Celestine is an impromptu late addition to a tour of a project that is revamping the redundant space under Ealing Broadway shopping centre that once marketed itself as “west London’s hottest nightclub”. The red velvet decor and dancing poles are being replaced by a light airy space that will open next month as a cafe by day and then a bar with live music or comedy in the evening alongside three cinema screens showing the latest blockbusters, locally made films and indie movies. Celestine is excited about the plans. “The community really wants a cinema,” she says. “If we want to go and see a film we have to go to Westfield [three and a half miles to the east]. It’s not that far, but it’s nice to have something really for the local community. So many places closed but now new things are coming in.” The £2m Ealing scheme is the latest from developer the Really Local Group (RLG) to transform former retail sites in shopping malls into community assets with cinemas, bars and space to host live music, after opening Catford Mews in south London in 2019 and Reading’s Biscuit Factory last year. The group has already announced five more projects along the same lines, including a refit of a building that used to house the nightclub Chicago’s in Sutton and of the Thorowgoods furniture shop in Bermondsey, both in south London, plus the redevelopment of a vinyl pressing plant in Hayes, west London. The schemes are all based in south-east England, but this week RLG plans to raise £4m in fresh funds, up to £1m of which is expected to come via local customers and the general public through crowdfunding site Seedrs, to back the opening of up to 50 venues around the UK. Most will be based around a cinema with a cafe or bar and have room for live music, comedy or DJs, with the focus likely to fall on large villages or small towns where places to watch films have disappeared. The group, which hopes one day to expand into Europe, has already raised £3m, mainly from high-net-worth individuals such as its founder, Preston Benson, an American who moved to London in 2005 to work for advisory firm Deloitte. He was inspired to remortgage his house to set up RLG in 2017 after seeing an opportunity in the UK’s changing town centres for developments that are more locally led. The group has recently bought Peckham Levels in south-east London, a former multi-storey car park that now houses food and retail outlets, artist studios and flexible office space, and a similar development in Hackney Bridge, east London, giving it access to expertise that it hopes will broaden the options for new developments. RLG is one of a number of enterprises that have sprung up to lead the reinvention of struggling town centres, where the decline of high street retail accelerated by the pandemic has left multiple derelict sites. Many are finding new uses for old department stores, such as Pop Recs, a music and arts venue founded in Sunderland’s Grade-II listed Binns building, or Bobby’s of Bournemouth, the independent outlet reopened in the town’s former branch of the now-defunct Debenhams chain. Benson says RLG consults residents about what they want and gives them input into the set-up and cultural programme, with about half of the projects he is working on developed in partnership with local councils. He says the group is not raising money from private equity as it wants to offer bespoke developments rather than be under pressure to roll out cookie-cutter projects as quickly as possible. “We don’t want to be seen as a chain churning out venues in every area,” he says. “I spent a lot of time walking around, and not being from [the UK] maybe I don’t have the same blinders. Most high streets seemed to be identikit and similar in what they were offering and clearly many of those [businesses] were private-equity backed,” he says. Benson says RLG is happy to take on “complicated space”, using clever design to work around awkward columns or other structural problems. Opportunities have been opened up since the start of the pandemic, which Benson says has been a “huge disruptor” to previous ways of doing things, enabling the group to “do things now we would have hoped to do in 2025”. However, he admits redeveloping sites during Covid has brought challenges, with Reading opening a year later than hoped because of delays to building work and restrictions on hospitality. It was not easy opening a cinema with film schedules held up and low public desire to sit cheek by jowl with others. “It was really difficult,” he says. “I’m proud we didn’t let anybody go during the pandemic and kept the building going.” Progress may continue to be rocky as the cost of living crisis leaves many with less spare cash to spend. But Benson is optimistic that the group’s £6.50 cinema ticket price – about half that at major chains in the capital – will still prove attractive. “People still need escapism and to do things. We hope our business is recession-proof. We’re making sure we are affordable and accessible.”",News/Business,Car park to cafe bar: how the Really Local Group is renewing the UK’s derelict spaces,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/car-park-to-cafe-bar-how-the-really-local-group-is-renewing-the-uks-derelict-spaces
5/12/2022,"A Night at the Opera, the classic rock album by Queen, has inspired a Japanese theatre production that will visit London this autumn as part of an international tour. Created by Hideki Noda, A Night at the Kabuki includes songs from the British band’s 1975 album which is best known for its singles Bohemian Rhapsody and You’re My Best Friend. The master tapes from the studio recording of the album are used in the show, which has a storyline set in 12th-century Japan and is inspired by Romeo and Juliet. Noda said that he had been planning to write about the aftermath of Shakespeare’s tragedy when an associate of the band brought him the idea of expanding on the theatrical aspect of Queen’s album. “I immediately thought it would be interesting to mash it up with the tale of the battle between the Genji and Taira clans,” he said. The Genpei war between the two clans lasted from 1180 to 1185. Against this backdrop, the plot features two pairs of star-crossed lovers and mixes comedy with tragedy. The cast includes Takako Matsu, Takaya Kamikawa, Suzu Hirose and Jun Shison. A Night at the Kabuki premiered in Japan in 2019. After a run this summer in Tokyo, it will visit Sadler’s Wells in London in September and then be staged in Osaka and Taipei. Its arrival in London was delayed by the pandemic. “People are now returning to theatres,” said Noda. “It’s all about being in the moment. That is what the legend called theatre is all about.” A playwright, director and actor, Noda has worked extensively in the UK and was made an OBE in 2009. His stylish and arresting productions, known for their physicality, include Red Demon staged at the Young Vic in London in 2003. The Diver, performed at Soho theatre in 2008, left the Guardian’s Michael Billington “intrigued, bemused, startled and fascinated”. A Night at the Kabuki is, of course, not the first time that the songs of Queen have powered a musical theatre production. We Will Rock You, on which the band collaborated with Ben Elton, ran for 12 years (and more than 4,500 performances) in the West End. Featuring 24 songs by Queen, including Bohemian Rhapsody, it is now on a UK tour.",Arts/Stage,Queen’s A Night at the Opera inspires Japanese take on Romeo and Juliet,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/may/12/queen-night-at-the-opera-japanese-romeo-juliet-kabuki
5/12/2022,"Anthony Albanese has clarified that Labor would only support a 5.1% pay rise for the 2% of Australians earning the minimum wage of $20.33 an hour – and only after one was ordered by the industrial tribunal. The opposition leader earlier this week said he “absolutely” supported a minimum wage rise in line with inflation but on Thursday made clear his stance did not extend to 2.7 million other workers whose pay was set by an industrial award. Albanese said his earlier comments also did not mean Labor would push for a 5.1% rise in its submission to the Fair Work Commission. Labor has focused on wages in the final fortnight of the federal election campaign, eager to paint the prime minister, Scott Morrison, as supporting a real pay cut for the lowest-paid workers with wages rising less than inflation. But Albanese and senior ministers have been less than definitive about how its position would translate into a submission to the Fair Work Commission’s annual wage review. The commission is accepting submissions until 7 June in a case that sets the pay of about one-quarter of Australia’s workforce. The federal government’s submission to the review notes that less than 2% or 235,000 Australian employees are paid the national minimum wage of $20.33 – far fewer than the 23% or 2.7 million employees whose pay is set by an award. Morrison repeated that fact in Wednesday night’s leader’s debate. In most years, the commission orders an identical increase to the national minimum wage and the minimums in 121 industrial awards, such as last year’s decision which boosted both by 2.5%. On Tuesday, Albanese was asked if he would support a pay rise of 5.1%, the current rate of inflation. “Absolutely,” he replied. The government has seized on the answer, incorrectly claiming that making a submission with a particular pay rise was unprecedented and arguing it would be inflationary. The comment was widely interpreted as meaning the 5.1% figure would be contained in Labor’s submission – but Albanese refused to guarantee that in the final leaders’ debate on Wednesday night. “It is very clear,” Albanese said during the debate. Although the Fair Work Commission “sets the wage” he argued low paid workers “don’t deserve a real wage cut”. “Those low wage workers, people on the minimum wage, are cleaners, they’re people working in the care sector, they’re people who work in retail, they are people who helped get us through the pandemic,” the Labor leader said. All three of the sectors listed by Albanese – aged care, retail, and cleaning services – are covered by awards. On Thursday, Albanese told reporters in Gladstone that “this is about whether those people on the minimum wage in Australia get a dollar”. “What I said the other day and I stand by consistently, is that if the Fair Work Commission makes a decision which says that real wages for minimum wage workers should not be cut, that is something that I would welcome,” he said. We're talking about a pay rise of $1 an hour for the lowest paid workers in Australia. pic.twitter.com/dAvPbcdtVb The comments confirm that Albanese’s construction of his “absolute” pledge is an answer to a hypothetical of whether he would welcome 5.1% after a rise of that size is ordered – rather than in a submission before the decision is made. Asked if he supported 5.1% rise across all industrial awards, Albanese replied that the commission “draws a distinction” between the national minimum wage and minimum rates in awards. “What I am talking about here is people who are on $20.33 an hour, that the federal government says they should have their real wage cut.” Earlier, Morrison told reporters in Bass that Albanese had “failed” to explain where he thinks “wages should or should not be”. “He has had three positions on the one thing on one day,” Morrison said. “He knows he got that wrong. He knows he acted recklessly, and he’s been trying to cover his tracks ever since.” Morrison argued that higher inflation would mean wage rises “would be clawed back in even higher interest rates and even higher inflation”.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese narrows scope of pledge to support 5.1% pay rise to match inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/12/anthony-albanese-narrows-scope-of-pledge-to-support-51-pay-rise-to-match-inflation
5/12/2022,"A Texas woman who suffers from dementia and was missing for three days was found in the early hours of last Friday, bruised and dehydrated but safe, after her dog’s barking helped rescuers track her down. Sherry Noppe, 63, left her home in Houston, Texas last week, to take her black labrador, Max, for a stroll. The pair never returned. For three days, authorities and volunteers searched for Noppe, who had recently been diagnosed with dementia. They eventually found her next to three-year old Max in George Bush Park, an 8,000-acre expanse next to her home. According to a family friend, Michael England, who joined search efforts, Noppe was found several hundred yards into the park. “As they got closer to her, I think that’s what caused him to bark because he was protecting her,” Sherry Noppe’s brother, Justin Noppe, told KHOU. “So I do think his barking is what led those people to hear him and go in that area and find her. So yes, I do believe he saved her life. “When they actually found her, they heard him growling and barking.” In a police statement, Constable Ted Heap of Harris county precinct 5, said Sherry Noppe “was located at approximately 3am on Friday by a group of tireless volunteers and deputies who were alerted by the sound of her dog, Max, barking in the woods”. Aside from a few minor cuts and bruises, Noppe was not injured. She was admitted to hospital with dehydration and was given fluids. “She’s doing surprisingly well for how long she’s been out there and the conditions that we were expecting: the heat, the rain,” said Courtney Noppe, her daughter. “We’re very grateful.”",News/US news,Pet dog’s barking leads rescuers to missing Texas woman with dementia,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/12/dog-barking-missing-woman-rescued-texas
