5/7/2022,"LEOLA, Pa. (AP) — Clotheslines with billowing linens and long dresses are a common sight on the off-grid farms of Pennsylvania's Lancaster County, home to the nation's largest Amish settlement. For many tourists they're as iconic a part of Amish Country's bucolic scenery as the rural lanes and wooden bridges. But for two days in late April, a clothesline with a different purpose was strung in a small indoor exhibit here. Hanging from it were 13 outfits representing the trauma of sexual assault suffered by members of the Amish, Mennonite and similar groups, a reminder that the modest attire they require, particularly of women and girls, is no protection. Each garment on display was either the actual one a survivor wore at the time they were assaulted or a replica assembled by volunteers to match the strict dress codes of the survivor's childhood church. One was a long-sleeve, periwinkle blue Amish dress with a simple stand collar. The accompanying sign said, “Survivor Age: 4 years old.” Next to it was a 5-year-old's heavy coat, hat and long, hunter green dress, displayed above sturdy black shoes. “I was never safe and I was a child. He was an adult,” a sign quoted the survivor as saying. “No one helped me when I told them he hurt me.” In Pennsylvania’s Lancaster County an exhibit of 13 simple outfits from victims of sexual assault attested to the reality that child sexual abuse is a serious problem among the Amish and similar groups known for their plain dress. (May 6) There was also an infant’s onesie. “You feel rage when you get a tiny little outfit in the mail,” said Ruth Ann Brubaker of Wayne County, Ohio, who helped put the exhibit together. “I didn’t know I could be so angry. Then you start crying.” The clothes on display represented various branches of the conservative Anabaptist tradition, which include Amish, Mennonite, Brethren and Charity. Often referred to as the Plain churches, they emphasize separation from mainstream society, church discipline, forgiveness and modest dress, including head coverings for women. It was part of a larger conference on awareness of sexual abuse in the Plain churches held April 29-30 at Forest Hills Mennonite Church in Leola and sponsored by two advocacy organizations: A Better Way, based in Zanesville, Ohio, and Safe Communities, of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Hope Anne Dueck, the executive director of A Better Way and one of the exhibit’s organizers, said many survivors report being told things such as “If you had been wearing your head covering, then you probably wouldn’t have been assaulted,” or “You couldn’t have been dressed modestly enough.” “And as a survivor myself,” Dueck said, ""I knew that that was not the truth.” “You can be harmed no matter what you’re wearing,” she said. Those who contributed to the exhibit “were wearing what their parents and the church prescribed, and wearing them correctly, and were still assaulted.” The exhibit was based on similar ones that have been staged at college campuses  and elsewhere in recent years called “What Were You Wearing?” They show a wide range of attire with the aim of shattering the myth that sexual assault can be blamed on what a victim had on. Current and former members of plain-dressing religious communities — not just the Anabaptists but others such as Holiness, an offshoot of Methodism with an emphasis on piety — agreed last year that it was time to hold their own version. “At the end of the day, it was never about the clothes,” said Mary Byler, a survivor of child sexual abuse in the Amish communities where she grew up. Byler, who founded the Colorado-based group The Misfit Amish to bridge cultural gaps between the Amish and the wider society, helped to organize the exhibit. “I hope it helps survivors know that they’re not alone,"" she said. Survivors were invited to submit their outfits or descriptions of them. All but one provided children's attire, mostly girls and one boy, reflecting their age when they were assaulted. The lone adult outfit belonged to a woman who was raped by her husband shortly after giving birth, Dueck said. Organizers plan to have high-quality photos made of the clothes to display online and in future exhibits. Plain church leaders have acknowledged in recent years that sexual abuse is a problem in their communities and have held seminars to raise awareness. But advocates say they need to do more, and that some leaders continue to treat abuse cases as matters of church discipline rather than as crimes to be reported to civil authorities. Dozens of offenders from Plain church affiliations have been convicted of sexually abusing children in the past two decades, according to a review of court files in several states. Several church leaders have been convicted for failing to report abuse, including an Amish bishop in Lancaster County in 2020. Researchers and organizers at the conference said they are surveying current and former Plain community members to gather concrete data on what they believe is a pervasive problem. But the display made a powerful statement on its own, said Darlene Shirk, a Mennonite from Lancaster County. “We talk about statistics ... but when you have something physical here, and because the dress is from the Plain community, it shouts, ‘Look, this is happening in our community!’” she said. Advocates say that in the male-led Plain churches, where forgiveness is taught as a paramount virtue, people are often pressured to reconcile  with their abusers or their children's abusers. Byler said that in the 18 years since she reported her sexual assaults to civil authorities, she has heard more stories of abuse in the Plain churches than she can count. Survivors are often isolated from their communities and met with “very victim-blaming statements,” she said. “Child sexual assault and sexual assault is something that happens ... inside of communities from every walk and way of life,” Byler said. ___ Associated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP’s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

5/7/2022,"In a familiar development on Fox News, “The Five” devolved into a shouting match Wednesday after Greg Gutfeld went on an offensive rant. The argument culminated in co-host Geraldo Rivera calling Gutfeld “arrogant” and “you insulting punk” before the other panelists smoothed things over and moved on to another speaker. The rant that spawned the argument began during a discussion about abortion rights, in the wake of the explosive Supreme Court draft majority opinion leak that would overturn Roe v. Wade. Gutfeld argued that “pro-lifers win because they can state their case.” “If you ask somebody why they’re pro-life, they will say, because abortion takes a life and we believe life is sacred. You can disagree with that,” he said. “But the problem with the pro-choicers is that they don’t have the balls to state their case plainly.” “Just say, like, I prefer freedom over fetuses,” added Gutfeld, who last week told viewers, “welcome to the freedom party lefties” after Elon Musk said he was buying Twitter. Geraldo: You insulting punk pic.twitter.com/hGjsEJCVpx — Acyn (@Acyn) May 4, 2022 He then went on to argue that people who support abortion are “more concerned about what they will lose than what they will gain” adding that mothers realize after giving birth that their lives would be “nothing” without their children. “A pro-choice mom can look at her adorable two-year-old and think, ‘my life would be nothing without her,’ in 2022. (But) in 2017, when she was young and single, didn’t have a kid, she could only imagine the loss of her freedom. Right? So that’s the issue.” He called on pro-choice advocates to “just be honest” and admit that “yeah, it kills an unborn kid, but I prefer my freedom.” He wrapped up his tirade by claiming “it used to be [that] even the pro-choicers would admit that abortion was an ugly thing, but they felt it had to be a necessary evil.” “But now when you go anywhere on social media, it’s something to celebrate, to cherish, to shout.” “That’s baloney,” Rivera interrupted, before the name-calling began. Earlier in the segment, Rivera had argued in favor of abortion access. “What am I going to tell my daughters now, that they don’t have control over their body? That they can’t make those choices for themselves?” he asked. “That some old man scratching his belly in some other state is going to [make that choice for you]?” Fox News viewers thrashed Rivera on Twitter after the altercation, with some calling for him to be removed from the show for his dissenting views. The veteran Fox News pundit was a longtime friend of Donald Trump but grew critical of the former president over his 2020 election lies and the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection he incited.

5/7/2022,"Elon Musk is taking Twitter private with the help of investors. Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange, invested $500 million. Binance's CEO called the sum a ""blank check,"" and said he didn't discuss a business plan with Musk. Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange, is investing $500 million as part of Elon Musk's deal to take Twitter private. That sum is simply a blank check, CEO Changpeng Zhao told the Financial Times on Thursday. Zhao quickly decided to dedicate half a billion dollars to the deal without hearing so much as a business plan from Musk, he said. ""We, from our friends, heard that [Musk] was looking for third party investors, and are we interested?,"" he recounted to the British newspaper. ""We immediately said that we are. He didn't have a plan for Twitter. There isn't, like, a business plan. So it wasn't that type of discussion."" Zhao told the Financial Times that Binance will support Musk however he chooses to use the funds and is especially excited about the potential of a cryptocurrency tie-in with Twitter. ""It's more of a blank check,"" Zhao told the outlet. ""After the investment ... Elon will figure out what he wants to do, and we'll be supportive of that."" While Musk has voiced a few options for changes at Twitter, including charging government and business users, eliminating bot accounts, and loosening content moderation (Musk calls himself a ""free speech absolutist""), there's been little overarching strategy laid out publicly. Although Musk said he doesn't care about the economics of Twitter during an interview at a TED conference in April, Bloomberg reported that he pitched various strategies for shoring up the social network's finances in meetings with bankers. According to The New York Times, Musk told potential investors they could double or triple their money and that he could grow Twitter's userbase to 500 million in short order. Joining Musk on his go-private bid are 18 backers, including Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, and Fidelity, who collectively invested some $7.1 billion, regulatory filings revealed on Thursday. Musk previously said he secured the $44 billion needed to buy Twitter through loans from seven banks, a loan against his stake in Tesla, and his own cash. The new investors will allow Musk to borrow less from banks, Musk told the Securities and Exchange Commission.
