1/28/2022,"The number of households made homeless because they were fleeing domestic abuse has risen by in more than a third in England since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest official figures. Between July and September of 2021, 6,310 households were accepted as homeless by local councils because of domestic abuse, an increase of 13.7% from the 5,550 recorded in the same quarter last year, and up 34.3% from the 4,700 in the third quarter of 2019.  They accounted for nearly one in five (17.3%) households made homeless during the period, second only to those whose family or friends were no longer willing to accommodate them, which accounted for 30.4%. According to the figures published on Thursday by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, a total of 36,510 households were identified as homeless from July to September last year, the first three full months’ worth of data after the eviction ban was lifted. The number of households including children who were made homeless was 9,730, 26.7% of the total. That was a rise of 15.1% from the same quarter in the previous year, and up 8.6% from 2019. A further 31,310 were identified as at risk of becoming homeless within 56 days, and in need of support, the figures showed. Overall, the numbers of households made homeless or at risk of homelessness was below levels seen just before the onset of the pandemic, but the situation was likely to worsen, according to Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter. She said: “Last summer, even with some Covid protections still in place, nearly 400 households a day were thrown into homelessness. Now, living costs are spiralling and all the protections are gone, even more people will be exposed to homelessness. “The advisers working on our emergency helpline can hear the sheer panic in people’s voices as they ring up desperate to keep a safe roof over their heads. The stress and uncertainty of the situation seeps into every part of a person’s or family’s life. “The end of the eviction ban has triggered a rising tide of homelessness that could turn into a flood. No-one should have to face homelessness alone, which is why we urgently need the public’s support so that we can keep picking up the phone and give anyone who needs it free and expert help.” Of the total 67,820 households identified as homeless or at risk of becoming homeless, more than half (51.1%) had at least one extra support need. A quarter had a history of mental health problems, 16.5% had a support need relating to physical ill health or disability, and 12.1% had experienced or were at risk of domestic abuse. Homelessness legislation requires local authorities to take “reasonable steps” to try to prevent or relieve a household’s homelessness by helping them to secure accommodation for at least six months.",News/Society,Domestic abuse rises sharply as cause of homelessness in England,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/homelessness-statistics-england-domestic-abuse
1/28/2022,"Joe Biden intends to announce his nominee to become the first Black woman to sit on the US supreme court by the end of February, the president said on Thursday at a formal White House event to mark the retirement of the liberal-leaning justice Stephen Breyer. Lauding the retiring justice as a “beacon of wisdom” and a “model public servant at a time of great division in this country”, Biden pledged to replace him with someone worthy of Breyer’s “legacy of excellence and decency”. He said the nominee would have “extraordinary qualifications, character, experience and integrity, and that person will be the first Black woman ever nominated to the United States supreme court.”  He added: “It is long overdue in my view.” Biden’s confirmation that he is still studying the résumés of candidates and has yet to make his pick will do little to settle nerves among progressives still smarting from Donald Trump’s three supreme court appointments. Many Democrats want the president to emulate the warp speed with which the Trump administration drove through the confirmation of Amy Coney Barrett in less than six weeks following Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death in September 2020. The Washington Post, citing an anonymous source, said that the majority leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, is aiming for a similar timeline. Replacing Breyer with a like-minded justice is seen by many Democrats as critical in preserving the already beleaguered rump of liberals on the bench. The retiring justice is one of only three such individuals on the nine-justice court, and they are so outnumbered that the country now faces drastic changes in several key areas from abortion to guns and affirmative action. Despite the pressure for haste among his party’s members, Biden insisted that he would be “rigorous” in choosing the nominee. He would listen to advice from senators and meet candidates, indicating a selection process that is likely to take weeks not days. For his part, Justice Breyer is hoping that his successor can be confirmed and in place within the next six months. In his formal retirement letter to Biden, he said he would step down at the start of the court’s summer recess in June or July, “assuming that by then my successor has been nominated and confirmed”. Speaking in the Roosevelt Room of the White House, Breyer made a lyrical paean to American unity. Recalling a speech he likes to deliver to school students, he said that the US was an experiment that is still going on. “My children and grandchildren will determine whether the experiment will last, and as an optimist I’m pretty sure that it will,” he said. Biden first committed himself to promoting a Black woman to the nation’s highest court at a presidential debate against Trump during the 2020 presidential campaign. The promise was reportedly made after intense prodding by the prominent South Carolina Democrat Jim Clyburn, who endorsed Biden the following day in a move that helped propel him into the White House. Though the race is now on to confirm Breyer’s replacement before the court’s term reaches its summer recess, there are large hurdles ahead. Looming over the proceedings is the evenly divided 50-50 split in the US Senate, the chamber that will preside over the confirmation hearings of whomsoever Biden picks. The Democrats hold the casting vote with Vice-President Kamala Harris, but they will need to keep all 50 senators on board during the process. That is a challenge that has eluded the Biden administration in recent months with the high-profile defections of Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema over vital issues ranging from the president’s Build Back Better legislation to overcoming the filibuster to secure essential voting rights reforms. To reduce any risk of Democratic splits, Schumer will also be looking to lure Republican moderates such as Susan Collins from Maine and Lisa Murkowski from Alaska to their side. Then there are the nationwide midterm elections in November which will inevitably place a partisan political pall over the confirmation process. Republicans have already begun to test out lines of attack, predicting that Biden’s nominee will be, in the words of the senator from Florida Rick Scott, “a radical liberal with extremist views”. Rightwing Twitter feeds have also lit up with claims that Biden’s choice of a Black woman would constitute unlawful sex and race discrimination. Those playing the affirmative-action card were forgetting that in 1980 Ronald Reagan pledged to pick the first woman to sit on the nation’s highest court, appointing Sandra Day O’Connor the following year. Republican leaders will be hoping that by portraying Biden’s choice as a culture wars threat to American values they will help to drive out the party’s base to the polling booths on 8 November. Similar calculations will be at play on the Democratic side. Party strategists will want to leverage the nomination of a Black woman as an energizing factor at the polls for important elements of its electorate who include African Americans, women and progressive voters.",News/Law,Biden to nominate first Black woman to sit on supreme court by end of February,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jan/27/biden-to-nominate-first-black-woman-supreme-court-end-february
1/28/2022,"More than a million students at 68 universities across the UK are to be hit by further strike action with up to 10 days of campus walkouts starting next month, union leaders have said. The University and College Union (UCU) said more than 50,000 university staff were expected to take part in the latest round of action over pensions, pay and working conditions, beginning with a five-day walkout from 14 February.  Last month staff at 58 institutions took part in a three-day strike as part of what has become a long-running and bitter campaign that the union has characterised as a “fight for the future of higher education”. Staff are taking action over two separate disputes. The first is over pension cuts for members of the University Superannuation Scheme (USS), which provides pensions to the UK’s older universities. The second is over low pay and issues such as insecure fixed-term contracts used to employ an increasing number of teaching staff. The UCU said if no agreement could be reached in forthcoming talks, 44 institutions would take part in the first week of action, a five-day walkout over the USS dispute; 68 institutions would take part in two days of action beginning on 21 February over pensions and pay and conditions; and 39 institutions would take part in three days of action beginning on 28 February over pay and working conditions. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: “For a sector that is worth tens of billions of pounds and enjoys record levels of student growth, it is beyond disgraceful that in return staff get vicious pension cuts, falling pay and are pushed to breaking point under deteriorating working conditions.” Universities UK, which represents the employers in the pensions dispute, responded: “Evidence from employers shows that UCU’s industrial action is not having the desired effect, with diminishing levels of disruption reported in every walkout since 2018.” Raj Jethwa, the chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association, which has been involved in negotiations over pay, said: “Rather than continuing this disruption, UCU should engage constructively in this year’s (2022-23) multi-employer negotiating round which is planned to begin at the end of March.” The National Union of Students came out in support of the action and called on its members to take part in a student strike on 2 March, to coincide with the final day of the UCU action. Its national president, Larissa Kennedy, said: “We will continue to stand with staff in their struggles because nothing about this broken system is inevitable.”",News/Education,UK university staff plan 10 more days of strikes in pay and pensions rows,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/27/uk-university-staff-plan-10-more-days-of-strikes-in-pay-and-pensions-rows
1/28/2022,"Investors in Greencore, the sandwich-maker that supplies UK retailers including M&S, narrowly failed on Thursday to block plans to pay out hundreds of thousands of pounds in executive bonuses, following outrage at the company’s failure to refund any of the near-£30m it received in government Covid support during the pandemic. At the firm’s annual general meeting, 46% of investors joined a rebellion against the Dublin-based company’s scheme to reward directors with bonus shares.  The firm, which also counts Sainsbury’s and the Co-op among its major UK clients, said that despite only securing 54% of the vote, it would press ahead with the scheme. Most companies that took government furlough funds and remained profitable have repaid the Treasury before offering staff and director’s bonuses. However, Greencore has joined a list of firms, including WH Smith, JD Sports and Homebase, that have hung on to money from one or more of the government pandemic rescue schemes. The shareholder adviser firms Glass Lewis and ISS said investors should consider rejecting Greencore’s remuneration report. Both advisers have raised concerns over the “appropriateness” of the FTSE 250 firm’s bonus payments, given its reliance on cash from the government furlough scheme, which subsidised staff salaries with state funds during the Covid outbreak. The company has defended its use of government funding, noting the severe drop in profits it suffered at the height of the pandemic, when lockdown orders hit sales of breakfast and lunchtime meals at most supermarkets. In a statement it said: “The board engaged extensively with shareholders to discuss the approach to remuneration. The board will continue to engage with shareholders on remuneration and other governance matters in the coming months, with a particular focus on the concerns of those that did not support the resolution at this time.” Greencore swung to a £10.8m loss in 2020, from a £56.4m profit a year earlier. The company tapped the state furlough programme for £21.3m in 2020, and a further £8.7m in 2021. While none of that taxpayer-funded cash has been repaid, Greencore paid €343,000 (£286,000) in share-based bonuses to its chief financial officer, Emma Hynes, for 2021, bringing her total pay to €895,000. The company also granted a £600,000 bonus to its chief executive, Patrick Coveney, but he will not receive his payout as he plans to leave the company to lead the travel caterer SSP by March this year. Before the meeting the company told investors that a better than expected boost to profits in 2021 and the “outstanding contribution of the management team” meant that the executive bonuses were “considered by the board to be appropriate”. It stressed the bonuses were only paid out in deferred shares, rather than cash, that will only be distributed after a total of five years and said it would conduct a review before doing so. “Greencore has consulted extensively with its shareholders on its remuneration policy, and is pleased with the level of support that it has received,” it said.

1/28/2022,"The Home Office has defended its right to seize the mobile phones of asylum seekers who cross the Channel in small boats, telling the high court it helps officials gather evidence about the people smugglers who organise such journeys. In a four-day judicial review, three asylum seekers are claiming that the home secretary unlawfully operated an unpublished, secret, blanket policy to seize phones from small-boat arrivals. Lawyers for the home secretary said that while they accepted some aspects of the policy that operated in 2020 were unlawful, the policy to seize phones from some people who arrived and instruct them to provide pin numbers to unlock data, including phone numbers, emails and photos, was lawful.  The policy instructing newly arrived asylum seekers to hand over phones and pin numbers operated between April and November 2020. It is likely to have involved the confiscation of thousands of mobile phones, the court heard in evidence earlier this week. Sir James Eadie QC, representing the home secretary, Priti Patel, told the court on Thursday that this was a case about clandestine Channel crossings and attempts to circumvent proper border controls. He said the crossings were putting lives at risk “in a manner that is grotesquely irresponsible” and that there was the very highest public interest in collating evidence obtained from phones that was likely to lead to the identification of the organisers so they could be prosecuted if appropriate. Eadie said there was a basis for phone seizures under current legislation “where the relevant thresholds were met”. The Home Office had initially denied the existence of this policy but later confirmed it. Eadie acknowledged that the Home Office had breached its duty of candour in relation to initially failing to admit that the unpublished policy to seize phones existed. He said it was “extremely unfortunate” and apologised. Alan Payne QC, also acting for the home secretary, said that a “reasonable grounds threshold” exists in legislation that permits items to be seized in relation to immigration and non-immigration offences. The Home Office has conceded that the way the seizure policy was previously implemented was unlawful in some respects due to its blanket, unpublished nature. But Payne argued it was lawful in its current format – where fewer phones of arriving people are seized, and specific individuals, such those who helm the dinghies, are targeted.

1/28/2022,"Sweeping reforms of campaign finance and lobbying laws are needed to end corporate influence over Australian politics that would be regarded as illegal and corrupt overseas, the Human Rights Law Centre says. In a new report titled Selling Out, the HRLC takes aim at three industries – fossil fuels, gambling and tobacco – that it claims are distorting Australia’s democracy through political donations, lobbying and public attack campaigns.  It calls for more transparency of political donations and a ban on those over $6,000, public disclosure of ministerial diaries and an end to the rotating door between political life and corporate lobbying. Other reforms sought by the HRLC include a strong federal anti-corruption commission and a cap on spending by all organisations that campaign during elections. The law centre says the Morrison government’s proposed corruption watchdog is inadequate. Friday’s report comes ahead of a federal election due to be held by May, and the release of 2020-21 political donations data by the Australian Electoral Commission next Tuesday. “Australians should be able to trust that politicians as their elected representatives have our best interests at heart but this report reveals it is big, harmful industries like tobacco, gambling and fossil fuels that are calling the shots,” Alice Drury, a senior lawyer at the HRLC, said. Drury said most Australian states were ahead of the commonwealth when it came to the HRLC’s legal reforms wishlist. “These are really commonsense law reforms that most states have already done and certainly, in many countries overseas, were implemented a long time ago.” AEC data included in the HRLC report shows that corporate political donations can be quite small compared to their profits. Between 2011 and 2020, one of Australia’s biggest companies, miner BHP – which makes billions of dollars a year in profits – gave just $2.9m in political contributions. But Drury said the AEC data was inadequate because it could take up to 19 months for a donation to be revealed, and many contributions escaped disclosure because they were made indirectly through industry associations. “The amount of money required to have significant amounts of political influence is actually somewhat low, or perhaps lower than you might expect,” she said. “Bearing in mind that we only know what is voluntarily disclosed in many instances, because disclosure laws are so weak, and also when you look at the sum of donations from each industry, it does become quite significant.” Drury said it was also important not to look at donations in isolation. “Each of these levers works together to have the end result of a huge amount of political power in the industries. It’s not political donations alone, or lobbying alone, or public attack campaigns alone. They work as a feedback loop with one another.” The report examines three public campaigns mounted by industry lobby groups in Australia in about 2010: the mining industry’s campaign against the mining tax, a campaign run by Clubs Australia against pre-commitment and pokie machine bet limits, and the tobacco lobby’s efforts to block plain packaging laws. Of the three, only the plain packaging campaign failed, with the mining tax campaign now widely regarded as one of the most effective corporate campaigns in Australian political history. Drury said lobbying was a democratic right but had become an industry dominated by corporate interests, drowning out the voices of ordinary people. The HRLC proposed closing a loophole that allows lobbyists directly employed by companies – estimated to be about 80% of the industry – to avoid putting their names on a public register kept by the attorney general’s department. Drury said she also supported ending what one lobbyist described to Guardian Australia as an outrageous exemption from the register enjoyed by accountants and lawyers who lobby on behalf of their clients. “Insofar as you’re just making representations on behalf of a client with a financial interest, and you’re trying to influence a decision in that respect, I don’t see why any different principles should apply to them,” she said. The widespread practice of quickly leaving government to become a lobbyist has “created its own elite class of the politically powerful and the incredibly rich” and should be banned, the HRLC said in the report. It said an existing cooling-off period designed to prevent ministers from lobbying in their portfolio areas for 18 months after leaving office was weakly enforced and called for a three-year ban – modelled on laws in Canada that attract penalties including fines or cuts to government pensions if they are breached. Former politicians who have moved to lobbying or peak body groups include Labor powerbroker Stephen Conroy, who was formerly the chief executive of gambling group Responsible Wagering Australia, and the former NSW Liberal minister Michael Photios who has worked as a lobbyist for the Australian Hotels Association. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Drury said Scott Morrison’s proposal for a federal anti-corruption commission was inadequate, as it did not include public hearings of the type held by bodies in most states and was too narrow in scope. “Experts on integrity commissions, consistently across Australia, have been calling for a model that allows for public hearings when it’s in the public interest and that extends the jurisdiction of the integrity commission beyond narrow forms of illegal corruption to misconduct that can undermine the administration of public funds and public institutions.”",News/Australia news,"Extensive reforms needed to curb corporate power in Australian politics, human rights group says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/28/extensive-reforms-needed-to-curb-corporate-power-in-australian-politics-human-rights-group-says
1/28/2022,"An evaluation on the effectiveness of benefit sanctions has been blocked by the work and pensions secretary Thérèse Coffey, it has emerged, as fresh government plans to impose financial penalties on jobless claimants who refuse any job offered to them were widely criticised as cruel and “missing the point”. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) commissioned its own internal research on the effectiveness of sanctions in 2019 and explicitly promised to make the findings public, in part to settle an ongoing political row over whether sanctions were effective – as ministers insisted they were – in persuading people into work.  Nearly three years later, as the DWP prepares to enforce a fresh wave of sanctions, it has emerged that the department buried the report and refused requests for it to be released, insisting that the study included “details of a sensitive nature” and it was in the “public interest” to keep the findings under wraps. On Tuesday, the DWP rejected a Freedom of Information request from Glasgow University academic David Webster to release a copy of the report. “It doesn’t look good when the DWP launches a new sanctions policy and does not let the public see the evidence that might help them to judge it,” Webster told the Guardian. Controversy over the effectiveness of sanctions – in essence, fines for infringements of the benefit rules – broke out again on Thursday as ministers announced they would tighten benefit punishments as part of a wider “Way to Work” initiative designed to persuade 500,000 unemployed people back into the labour market. Employment experts insisted that tightening sanctions would backfire, because a mountain of published evidence – including from the government’s spending watchdog and the DWP’s own advisory committee – shows threatening claimants with the loss of benefits does not incentivise them to take up unsuitable jobs, and instead is likely to make them stressed and ill. Ministers promised to commission research into sanctions in February 2019 and a formal DWP response to a cross-party select committee inquiry concluded there was no evidence that financial penalties helped people get a job, but they did have “profoundly negative” effects on claimants’ health and finances. Although Coffey was not appointed welfare secretary until September 2019, the DWP director general for universal credit, Neil Couling, told a House of Lords committee in June 2020, that he and Coffey had discussed the research and had “every intention of fulfilling” the DWP’s promise to make the research public. However, in a letter to Webster this week, the DWP wrote: “We recognise that the publication of the information requested could provide a greater understanding of the effectiveness of benefit sanctions. “However, we have to balance this against the fact that the withheld documentation includes details of a sensitive nature whose publication would be likely to inhibit candour and be likely to prejudice the effective conduct of public affairs.” The DWP claimed that because one section of the planned research, on the “deterrent effect” – the effect of sanctions on claimants not actually sanctioned – was unable to be properly assessed, the entire study was invalidated. It refused Webster’s request to see parts of the report not related to the deterrent effect. Webster, an authority on sanctions policy, said he would appeal against the ruling. “Either the DWP study confirms the existing body of research on sanctions, or it significantly contradicts it; either way, it is highly important from a public policy point of view that it should be released.” Under Way to Work, claimants will be given just four weeks – down from three months – to find a job within their preferred sector. After that point, part of their universal credit payment will be withdrawn, or “sanctioned”, if they are deemed to have failed to make “reasonable efforts” to secure a job, or turned down a job offer. The move was criticised by opposition MPs as an opportunistic political move to distract from the Downing street partygate scandal and convince backbench Tory MPs – many who are traditionally eager supporters of attacks on so-called welfare scroungers – that the prime minister has a grip on domestic policy agenda. Katie Schmuecker, the deputy director of policy and partnerships at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the sanctions announcement “misses the point” as it will only apply to about 130,000 people – just one in 20 of all those out of work and claiming universal credit. A DWP spokesperson said the department could not publish the report because it did not present a comprehensive picture of sanctions. They added: “With a record number of jobs available, it’s right that people who can work are encouraged to take up available roles. Our new approach will help claimants get quickly back into work, while ensuring businesses get the people they and the economy need. “We know work is the best way for people to get on, to improve their lives and support their families because, as well as being good for mental wellbeing, people are at least £6,000 better off in full-time work than on benefits. “As part of our new campaign, jobseekers will receive better, tailored support to get into work from our work coaches, and through jobcentres partnering with employers to match talent to vacancies.”",News/Society,Report on effectiveness of benefit sanctions blocked by DWP,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/report-on-effectiveness-of-benefit-sanctions-blocked-by-dwp
1/28/2022,"Soon after the Taliban swept into Kabul, with Afghanistan’s economy collapsing, people began to sell meagre possessions, from mattresses to cooking pots, to buy basic necessities. Now we learn that desperate Afghans are selling their children and their kidneys, finding no other way to keep their families from starvation. Almost everyone is short of food; more than half the population faces extreme levels of hunger, and nearly 9 million are at risk of famine. The desperation will only worsen. The foreign aid that fuelled the economy has vanished; huge numbers are jobless; food prices have soared. Drought has worsened the already grim picture. The UN says that $8bn is needed now: $4.4bn in humanitarian assistance, and $3.6bn to deliver essential services and maintain community infrastructure. Deborah Lyons, the special representative for Afghanistan, noted that donors are worried that they may help the Taliban consolidate their position or seem to be legitimising it. The disappearance of feminist activists last week – after one filmed a video of men she said were Taliban trying to enter her home – is further horrifying evidence of their brutal rule. Many older girls are still barred from school. LGBTQ+ people have reported mob attacks and rape. No one wants to give succour to the Taliban. But it should be possible to deal with them to support ordinary Afghans without formally recognising their government. The alternative is to abandon Afghans, who are suffering twice over: from Taliban control and from the international response to it.  A funding conference is desperately needed. The United States is unlikely to step up; Joe Biden wants to put the withdrawal fiasco behind him. Gordon Brown, the former British prime minister, has rightly urged – along with Malala Yousafzai and Save the Children – that the UK should act as the host. Britain too has a responsibility to the Afghan people. It has not met this. It has failed too many of those who are vulnerable because they worked with the UK, or because they did what it urged them to do – such as the women who joined the police or judiciary. As Kabul fell, the government approved the evacuation of cats and dogs cared for by the British animal charity Nowzad and vets who officials admitted were not “extremely vulnerable”, while humans known to be in immediate and severe danger have been denied refuge in the UK. From Foreign Office emails and other documents disclosed on Wednesday, it appears that officials acted on the prime minister’s personal authorisation, despite his denials. “We are human beings living here like animals, while they are rescuing animals from Afghanistan,” said one man who worked for the British as a consultant – and whose pregnant wife was shot dead when the Taliban raided their home. He has been told that he does not qualify for the Afghan relocations and assistance policy (Arap) because he was employed indirectly. It was supposed to be supplemented by the Afghan citizens resettlement scheme, but there is no way for individuals to apply. It has also been rebadging people who have already arrived in the UK under Arap. This is shameful. Britain must do more for Afghans who are not safe in their country. But it must also help the many more who will remain there. A funding conference ought to address underlying issues, not just request pledges. The waivers given for humanitarian aid are wholly inadequate: the US should smooth the path for development aid too, but above all, the financial system, on the brink of collapse, must be revived. No aid can suffice when the economy is being strangled. Given the justified concerns that the Taliban could benefit, a variety of solutions have been put forward, from the conditional release of a chunk of Afghanistan’s frozen reserves to credit swaps. Catastrophe can still be averted. It must be.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Afghanistan’s despair: the UK must step up | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/27/the-guardian-view-on-afghanistans-despair-the-uk-must-step-up
1/28/2022,"The National Gallery of Ireland’s exhibition of the work of Jack B Yeats, soon to conclude, is most encouraging for those who feel that they have yet to fulfil their creative potential. The artist made many of his most avant garde works when he was in his 70s and 80s, a period in which he was also at his most prolific as an oil painter. As an artist, he ended up worlds away from the young man he’d been in 1905, producing sketches for the Manchester Guardian to illustrate JM Synge’s pioneering articles on the appalling poverty suffered by the inhabitants of rural Connemara and Mayo. Over time, his style loosened and dissolved into near abstraction – though he never abandoned elements of figuration. By the end, he was no longer working from observation, but from memory. Memory is fallible. Family members will remember the same incidents differently, and describe them using different words. Eyewitness accounts often vary. Memory is slippery and dangerous, but that is also what makes it such a profoundly important creative tool. Where would Paula Rego be without her self-consciously faulty use of memory, one that verges on mythologisation, in an oeuvre that draws so deeply on her childhood? The point for her is not accurate, photographic recall, but memory used almost as a dreamscape, to be visited to harvest artistic material. James Joyce’s reconstruction of Dublin in Ulysses, published a century ago this year, relishes precisely recalled topographical details – but he used memory to alienate himself from his native city, so that he could re-render it as the epic canvas for his masterpiece of modernism.  The National Gallery exhibition shows Yeats returning to similar scenes throughout his career; often, the further he is, temporally, from the source material (childhood holidays in Sligo, the 1920s streetscapes of Dublin), the more powerful the work. The American author George Saunders has made a similar point about distance, memory and creativity in a different context: that of the work of Leo Tolstoy. The Snowstorm, a story published in 1856, has an almost documentary quality, he argues, based as it was on an actual event two years previously in which the author had been lost all night in the snow. By the time he came to write Master and Man four decades later, based on the same experience, memory had been transfigured into a masterpiece of the short story form. Yeats’s very last paintings, made in the 1940s and 50s, can seem almost numinous, filled with a significance beyond their apparent subject matter. His Leaving the Far Point (1946) seems on one level to conjure up a memory from his youth, as three figures in holiday finery amble along a Sligo shore. But the figures almost deliquesce into the landscape behind them; there is a great sense of loss in this work. The neuroscientist Prof Ruth Byrne has pointed out that these late works sometimes not only depict remembered scenes, but in a sense, render how scenes are remembered – “faintly and tenuously”. The painting speaks of nostalgia, mortality and loss, but also, through the very fragility of the figures, the elusive nature of memory itself.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on memory in art: fallible yet magical | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/27/the-guardian-view-on-memory-in-art-fallible-yet-magical
1/28/2022,"As the Tories’ most senior Muslim female politician, Sayeeda Warsi, puts it, to be accused of Islamophobia is “career enhancing”, but to be a victim of Islamophobia is “career destroying”. She should know: her often lonely public campaign against Islamophobia has been rewarded with political exile. What could be described as Warsi’s law applies to Nusrat Ghani too: a Tory politician who claims to have been sacked as a minister because her “Muslimness” was “making colleagues uncomfortable”. Compare and contrast their experience with Zac Goldsmith’s: after a failed London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan that was accused of being riddled with Islamophobia, Goldsmith was elevated to the House of Lords and made a minister. Or what of Nadine Dorries, who has retweeted far-right criminal Tommy Robinson, and responded to a video from Khan about tackling Islamophobic hate speech with: “How about, ‘it’s time to act on sex abusing grooming gangs’ instead?”  Islamophobia reaches down into the grassroots of the party. A YouGov poll uncovered that six out of 10 Tory members believe Islam “is generally a threat to western civilisation”, that 45% believe the racist lie about “no go areas” for non-Muslims, and nearly half don’t want a Muslim prime minister. However politically convenient it may be to pretend this is a Tory-specific problem, the Labour party cannot claim to be innocent. Twenty-nine per cent of its Muslim members report suffering Islamophobia in the party, over a third have witnessed it, and 44% didn’t believe the party took it seriously. During the Batley and Spen byelection, Labour officials briefed rightwing newspapers that they were losing Muslim support because of Keir Starmer’s efforts to tackle antisemitism, and welcomed losing “the conservative Muslim vote” over Labour’s position on gay rights and Palestine. This bigoted depiction of often lifelong Labour voters for cynical electoral benefit is Islamophobia, pure and simple. Witness, too, how Labour rescinded the suspension of Trevor Phillips after he described Muslims as “a nation within a nation”. More widely, anti-Muslim racism is endemic in British society, with a new study finding that middle-class social groups are significantly more likely to admit to bigoted views about Islamic beliefs than their working-class counterparts. I have been inundated with examples of what should be described as anti-Muslim racism. Telecoms engineer Usman Chaudhary has had eggs thrown at him in Rochdale while strangers yelled “Bin Laden” and “terrorist” at him. Many others tell me of passersby hissing “Isis” and “suicide bomber” at them. One civil servant working for central government spoke of white colleagues saying, “he’s one of the good ones!”. Apologists for Islamophobia play semantic games – “Islam is not a race” is their go-to jibe – but, as Warsi tells me, “discrimination is not based on the actual practice of your faith, it’s about a racial identity of Muslimness or perceived Muslimness”. No wonder there are no adverse political consequences for Islamophobia: anti-Muslim bigotry is condoned and perpetuated across the spectrum of the British press. While one study found that 78% of the Mail on Sunday’s stories featuring Muslims were negative, the Times, our supposed paper of record, confers Islamophobia with respectability with headlines such as “Christian child forced into Muslim foster care”. A correction to this dishonest story eventually came, but the damage was done. “If you look at the polling and survey evidence, there’s been no real progress in the last decade in how Muslims are seen in society,” Miqdaad Versi, director for media monitoring at the Muslim Council of Britain, tells me. Why? Partly because British Muslims – half of whom live in the poorest 10% communities – lack power and an organised voice. The rhetoric fanned by media outlets and politicians, particularly during the “war on terror”, has further normalised this racism. Like all forms of bigotry, it’s the voices of the victims that need to be heard the loudest. But that doesn’t mean non-Muslims shouldn’t speak out: the failure to do so is what makes anti-Muslim hate mainstream, and that is why to say nothing is to be complicit.

1/28/2022,"As a planet-killing asteroid hurtles towards Earth in the film Don’t Look Up, scientists Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio scramble to get the world to take the threat seriously. For many, the Netflix hit was an allegory of the world’s inaction on climate change, but now a pair of physicists have taken a more literal view of the question at the heart of the drama: if a 10km-wide asteroid is six months away from impact, is it possible to avert a planet-ending catastrophe?  The answer, from a purely technical perspective, appears to be yes. “We show that humanity has crossed a technological threshold to prevent us from ‘going the way of the dinosaurs’,” Prof Philip Lubin and Alex Cohen, both physics researchers at the University of California Santa Barbara, conclude in their paper posted this week on the Arxiv database. The 15-page analysis starts by weighing up the scale of the threat posed by a 10km-wide asteroid, concluding that it would have similar impact energy to the asteroid event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs 66m years ago. Allowing such an object to enter the Earth’s atmosphere could, in an extreme scenario, result in staggering atmospheric temperature rises of 300C, destroying virtually all life on Earth. The merits of different options are considered, with the PI (Pulverize It) method being among those favoured. This would involve an array of penetrators being used to inject nuclear detonators that would split the asteroid into fragments that would either miss Earth entirely (for larger asteroids) or be small enough to burn up in the atmosphere (for asteroids smaller than 1km across). Radioactive fragments hitting the Earth would not be a major concern, the paper said. The approach would pose political challenges, since testing the detonators before deployment would currently be banned under the nuclear test ban treaty. “In any realistic scenario of an existential threat, presumably logic would prevail, at least one would hope,” the authors write, perhaps drawing inspiration from the 1979 film, Meteor, in which the United States (Sean Connery) and the then Soviet Union (Natalie Wood) put aside cold war tensions to deal with an incoming asteroid (not a meteor). The paper also considers the option deployed in the 1999 film, Armageddon, where oil rig workers, Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, are hired by Nasa to drill into an asteroid the size of Texas and detonate a nuclear bomb to break it into pieces. This is a less realistic scenario, the paper concludes. Such enormous asteroids do exist – Ceres, the first asteroid detected, is nearly this size. However, breaking it in half would require about 10m Gigatons TNT, equivalent to more than 1m times the energy of the Earth’s entire nuclear arsenal. In the case that attempts to divert or destroy the incoming asteroid fail, the paper suggests that underwater or subterranean bunkers as a last-ditch line of defence. “Taking life underwater or underground would be a wise civil defence-based strategy to assure some survival of the human and other species,” the paper said. The paper concludes on the optimistic note that averting the existential threat of a large, Earthbound asteroid is just at the limit of our technological capabilities. “Ideally, we would never be in this situation, but better ready than dead.” The duo are not the first to consider the scenario from a technical perspective. There is an active research community working on planetary defence. The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs holds an annual conference on the subject in which experts consider mitigation scenarios, legal issues and how communications might be handled. However, some were less than enthusiastic about the paper’s premise. Mark McCaughrean, senior adviser for science & exploration at the European Space Agency, described the work as “classic space bubble nerdery”. “Answer the technical question, but completely miss the point of the film, namely that the advice of scientists is routinely ignored,” McCaughrean said on Twitter. “Especially when the real disaster is happening now and in a way that’s too slow and boring for people to care.”",News/Science,"‘Don’t Look Up’: humanity could avert asteroid Armageddon, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/jan/27/dont-look-up-an-actual-comet-wiping-out-earth-would-be-avertable-scientists-say
1/28/2022,"From Monday, coronavirus restrictions related to care homes in England will be eased. Here are the changes, and the science behind them.  Residents who test positive will have to self-isolate for up to 10 days, with a minimum isolation period of five full days followed by two sequential negative lateral flow tests – as is already the case for the rest of the population. Isolation periods for those having care after an emergency hospital visit will also be reduced to a maximum of 10 days, while a requirement for residents to test or self-isolate after normal visits out will be removed. Care homes will have to follow outbreak management rules for 14 rather than 28 days, and by 16 February care workers will need to use lateral flow tests before work rather than taking a weekly PCR test. The limit on visitors to care homes will be lifted. Visitors should still obtain a negative lateral flow test result earlier in the day of their visit, and guidance on the use by visitors of PPE such as face masks remains unchanged. According to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), it has been enabled by a successful booster vaccination programme, with 86.5% of care home residents having had their booster jab. The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) shows that with a Pfizer booster – regardless of the vaccines used for previous doses – the effectiveness against hospitalisation is about 90% shortly after receiving the jab, falling to about 75% after 10 to 14 weeks. Very high levels of protection are also seen for Moderna boosters. The figures suggest vaccine effectiveness against death in people aged 50 and older is about 95% two weeks after a booster. The DHSC says: “Since 11 November last year all care home workers, and anyone entering a care home, have needed to be fully vaccinated, unless they are exempt under the regulations.” That means there may be some staff who, for medical reasons, have not been vaccinated. The care minister, Gillian Keegan, said the changes were backed by scientists, and experts largely agree. “If lateral flow tests are used in conjunction to prevent most contact with infectious people, then broadly speaking the risk will be low,” said Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh and member of the modelling group Spi-M. He said there remained an issue for residents and staff when it came to those with existing conditions or who were unvaccinated, either by choice or for other reasons. “In those cases there should be measures and protocols in place to prevent them from being viewed as second-class citizens,” he said. Ian Hall, a professor of mathematical epidemiology and statistics at the University of Manchester and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), backed the changes. “The decision was reviewed scientifically and is a balance of harms of Covid but also the harm of deconditioning and wellbeing from isolation in a highly vaccinated population,” he said. “We strongly recommended that measures are put in place to observe the impact of these measures following implementation and if there are clear episodes of transmission the risk assessment is reviewed.” Others cautioned against easing measures any further. Dr Helen Salisbury, a GP in Oxford, said it would be “foolhardy” to remove the need for lateral flow tests and masks for visitors, noting that not everyone who had three jabs had had a strong immune response, that people tend to develop more health problems as they get older, and that even among the vaccinated, the risks from Covid increase with age. “I’m delighted if people are able to see their families, but it doesn’t make sense to me to lift all restrictions completely,” she said.",News/Society,What are the new Covid rules for English care homes and are they safe?,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/27/what-are-the-new-covid-rules-for-english-care-homes-and-are-they-safe
