5/9/2022,"A rugby club has been left in shock after Samoan back row forward Kelly Meafua died after jumping from a bridge into the river Tarn hours after playing in a French second division match. Meafua’s club Montauban confirmed the 32-year-old had not survived the incident in the early hours of Saturday morning despite the efforts of a teammate. The teammate, named as prop Christopher Vaotoa in French media reports, jumped into the water but was unable to save Meafua. Vaotoa was taken to hospital with hypothermia and was discharged in good health on Saturday. The pair had reportedly been out celebrating Montauban’s 48-40 win over Narbonne just hours earlier in the team’s final home Pro D2 game of the season at Stade Sapiac. Montauban said the club was in shock following Meafua’s death. “The entire club is shocked and everyone is thinking of his wife, his children, his teammates and more generally everyone who loves the club,” a club statement read. “Kelly was a player who was well liked by everybody. His joy for life was infectious and radiant. Today we have lost a player, a friend and a brother.” Born in Samoa, Meafua moved to New Zealand when he was a teenager but did not start playing rugby until he was 20. After stints with Otahuhu, Auckland Under–21s and Auckland Sevens, he moved to Sydney where he played for West Harbour in the Shute Shield and the Greater Sydney Rams. He was also a member of the NSW Waratahs extended training squad in 2014 before leaving for France to play for Narbonne in 2015. He had a spell with Beziers before moving to Montauban last year. This season he played 24 Pro D2 matches and scored eight tries for Montauban.",Sport/Sport,Samoan rugby player Kelly Meafua dies after jumping from bridge in France celebrating win,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/09/samoan-rugby-player-kelly-meafua-dies-after-jumping-from-bridge-in-france-celebrating-win
5/9/2022,"The second leaders’ debate of the election campaign, hosted by Channel Nine, attracted 641,000 viewers, however the network’s own employees have criticised the format as a “shambles”. The Great Debate on Nine averaged 641,000 metro viewers, a relatively high figure for a 90-minute program ending after 10pm on a Sunday night. Hosted by 60 Minutes reporter Sarah Abo, the debate won its time slot, beating Seven News’ Spotlight, Ten’s FBI and the new Australian drama Barons on the ABC. The strong ratings performance of the second election debate gave Nine an easy win on Sunday, with 33.4% to Seven’s 30.4%, Ten’s 15.8%, ABC 12.5% and SBS 7.9%. Watching that #leadersdebate was like having all the worst elements of this agonising campaign squeezed into an hour and a half window. Pure torture. Leaders faced questions from three journalists at the Nine network – 2GB radio host Deborah Knight, Nine News’ political editor Chris Uhlmann, and the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age’s chief political correspondent David Crowe. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, and the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, were also allowed to ask each other two questions. Viewers writing on Twitter criticised how the debate was run, with both leaders consistently talking over each other and the presenters asking questions. A website Nine ran to gather audience opinion on who won the debate encountered technical issues. Still not working #leadersdebate pic.twitter.com/WI03kQjEAB On Monday morning, Ben Fordham, a talkback host at Nine’s 2GB radio station, was critical of the debate format, saying it was “all over the shop”. “People have got better things to do than waste their Sunday night listening to two people talking over each other. It’s like watching two blokes at the pub arguing over the colour of the carpet,” he said. “It was a shambles. It was messy, disjointed, awkward,” Fordham said. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age’s national affairs editor James Massola – also an employee of Nine – wrote “it was supposed to be a civilised election debate, but it ended up being a straight-up political brawl with no clear winner”. So, Nine’s debate QR code seems to have gone a bit rogue. 👇🏻 pic.twitter.com/x5nUrHZyrO “The two leaders repeatedly needled and jabbed at each other, talking over the top of their counterpart in a bid to unsettle them,” he said. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young said the debate format was “woeful and a disservice to voters”, and backed calls for an independent debates commission to be established. “Those of us who suffered through it watched two grown men – so-called leaders – shouting at each other, interrupting, smirking and aggressively talking over the top of others including the female moderator. Wow this is a rabble “Australians shouldn’t be subjected to this unseemly squabble again. An election debate should be a contest of ideas and vision for our country, not chest-thumping,” Hanson-Young said. Nine’s debate drew a much larger audience than the first debate on Sky News Australia. That debate, where the audience asked the questions, averaged 175,000 metro viewers on the subscription television platform. The Sky figures do not include those who watched it via a free livestream.",News/Australia news,Second leaders’ debate a ratings winner for Nine despite employees criticising it as a ‘shambles’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/09/second-leaders-debate-a-ratings-winner-for-nine-despite-employees-criticising-it-as-a-shambles
