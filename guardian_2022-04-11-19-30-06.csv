4/11/2022,"Berlin is often overlooked as a football city. Not this weekend. For the first time in over two years the Olympiastadion was sold out and singing, but it was the only aspect of sporting life in the capital that looked different. With nearly 75,000 stuffed into the old stadium and a level of fervour that is not always the calling card of Berlin and its football, its most bankable name, Hertha, wasn’t quite up to the moment – not for the first time this season. It was the substantial visiting support that enjoyed their afternoon, with an estimated 15,000 in the red and white of Union bathing in the glory of an emphatic derby win. “The fans made it a home game again,” said Grischa Prömel, who headed the team’s second goal and was teary after his last derby before leaving for Hoffenheim in the summer. It’s just nice to beat Hertha three times and be city champions for a reason.” That’s right, three times. Since arriving in the Bundesliga in 2019, Union have moved from curio to irritant to, now, dominant force. Urs Fischer’s side won the first-ever top-flight derby between the two in November that year, with Sebastian Polter’s late penalty cutting through the cacophony and the flurry of pyro. There was plenty of both of those elements on Saturday evening, though less of the balance and tension that characterised that meeting two years at Stadion An der Altern Försterei, an opening statement at the top table from Union which becomes only more resonant as time goes by. “The fact that the Köpenickers, with [Timo] Baumgartl’s own goal at the beginning of the second half, also contributed to making the third derby even more exciting this season should not go unmentioned here”, wrote Berliner Morgenpost’s Michael Färber. Baumgartl’s slip, lifting an attempted clearance onto his own head and in, was the gift that Hertha desperately needed to get back into the game. Less than four minutes later, though, the visitors were back in front via Prömel’s header. Well-taken goals on the break by Union’s Sheraldo Becker and Sven Michel gave the scoreline an emphatic sheen that it merited and after victories earlier this season in the reverse Bundesliga fixture and here in the DfB Pokal, reminded Hertha who is boss in Berlin. For if the men in Köpenick still do their business with a certain modesty, it is debatable whether they can be reasonably described as underdogs. Now, Union have status. They know it too, and you could see from the moment the players stepped onto the Olympiastadion pitch for their pre-match walkaround on arrival. They were booed by the Hertha fans already in the stadium and the smiles on the players’ faces made it clear they were enjoying the notoriety. Perhaps more unexpectedly, Union acknowledged it in the days leading up to the derby too. When Fischer spoke in Thursday’s press conference, he made a nod to growing expectations and ambitions. “We agreed between us,” the coach said of a chat between his players and staff, “that we’ll try and get fifth or sixth place.” He did talk – in character – more conservatively about “defending seventh,” which “could be enough for the Conference League again,” but for a man who has won titles in Switzerland, Fischer has always been painfully realistic at Union, consistently talking up avoiding relegation as the main prize and anything else as a bonus. Last year’s European qualification had been a delightful bonus for Union. This time, it is a stated aim, even after losing attacking lynchpin Max Kruse back to Wolfsburg in January. Christian Arbeit, Union’s club spokesman casually referred to Olympiastadion as “our European stadium,” with the Altern Försterei not passed fit to host Uefa matches. The chances are it will be again next term, adding to Hertha’s indignation. There was plenty of that among the home fans at full-time. When ultras in the Ostkurve demanded of their approaching players that they take off their Hertha shirts, it was a scene reminiscent of Schalke’s hardcore ‘repossessing’ Benjamin Stambouli’s captain armband after a hefty home defeat to Fortuna Düsseldorf in March 2019 as the club tumbled towards crisis. Those who complied were largely the younger members of the Hertha squad like teenager Linus Gechter, who have inherited an unfair amount of responsibility on the back of the club’s past mistakes. “A line was crossed that is not okay,” head of sport Fredi Bobic told Sport 1 Doppelpass on Sunday, and it is the last thing that Hertha needed as they remained second-bottom. Maximilian Mittelstädt, one of those who removed his shirt, preferred not to detail the discussion that had gone on between fans and players - “I want to avoid a conflict at the moment” – but this was not about one game and not about the recently-appointed Felix Magath, but about a cumulative frustration, which had last boiled over after a loss in the same fixture in the Pokal, back in January, with protests at the training ground. Magath has got through a lot of valuable work to keep this fractured bunch in touch with safety, and now he must find dig deep again. While Hertha scrap to stay in the league, Union have an extra game to look forward to – a Pokal semi-final against RB Leipzig. They can make Europe through the league or the cup. “To do it through both would be nice,” pondered Prömel. Meanwhile Magath’s reasonable attempts to put the defeat into perspective rubbed salt into the wound. “The opponents we have in the next few games are not quite at the level of Union Berlin, so there will be opportunities for us,” said the coach. With Augsburg, Stuttgart and Arminia Bielefeld next up, he’s right, but it still hurts – just like the truth of Saturday night did.  “I have a lot to do before Tuesday,” said Julian Nagelsmann. “I’m aware of that. He won’t be dwelling too much on the narrow win over Augsburg, with Robert Lewandowski’s late penalty the decisive blow, but more on personnel ahead of the Champions League return with Villarreal. The ill Niklas Süle will be missing along with Corentin Tolisso, while the coach accepts Serge Gnabry and Leroy Sané need to recapture their form. There was bad injury news for Borussia Dortmund too, with Gio Reyna forced off in tears in the opening moments at Stuttgart with a recurrence of the thigh injury that has ruined his season. His replacement Julian Brandt scored twice to clinch a win but the concern over the US international overshadowed it, while Mats Hummels went off at half-time and is also out indefinitely. On a day in which a suggestion that Leipzig would provide competition with Manchester United for the signature of Erik Ten Hag, Domenico Tedesco’s side performed with the sort of swagger that underlined what an unlikely move that would be. They hammered a depleted Hoffenheim 3-0, probably putting the Sinsheim team out of Champions League contention. Christopher Nkunku’s excellent early strike opened the way after which “you can tear up the game plan,” as visiting coach Sebastian Hoeness said.",Sport/Football,Olympiastadion sells out as Union remind Hertha who’s boss in Berlin | Andy Brassell,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/olympiastadion-sells-out-as-union-remind-hertha-whos-boss-in-berlin
4/11/2022,"When does a name become a crossword name? Or: when does a setter think someone is well-known enough that most solvers will understand a reference to him or her? Appearing in a clue or an answer is flattering, according to a remark that my notes tell me is from a 1953 edition of this newspaper: When Foyles gave [gardening writer Beverley Nichols] a luncheon today to mark the publication of his latest book he talked of the payment of supertax not indicating ‘arrival’, rather is it, he said, when a writer is parodied in Punch or becomes a crossword clue. The clue to Mr Nichols’s identity, he asserts, was ‘Public anemone No 1’. If, at the beginning of that paragraph, you – like me – initially pictured Beverley as a woman, perhaps he is not as renowned today as he imagined he would be. Late in life he predicted that in the 22nd century, he would be spoken of alongside Jane Austen and Beatrix Potter. But if a setter today used “Beverley Nichols perhaps” as the definition part for an entry of GARDENER, there would quite rightly be indignant letters to the editor, as it would be unfair for the solver to infer GARDENER from a name that’s now as forgotten as Nichols’s other books on parapsychology, cats and so on. The time after you’re well-known is no good for crosswords, then; and the same goes the time approaching your heyday, as shown by a couple of recent examples. In the Independent, Tees gives us this clue … 13a Hair-to-rug transformation seen in spin supremo? (4,5)[ wordplay: anagram (“transformation”) of HAIRTORUG ][ definition: spin supremo ] … for Downing Street Director of Communications GUTO HARRI; it was Harri who pronounced the prime minister “not a complete clown” which in itself makes him more eligible as an answer than he would have been when he was merely the BBC’s chief political correspondent. Likewise, since winning Strictly Come Dancing, Bill Bailey has appeared in such places as Qaos’s clue … 23d Court jester? (6)[ double definition ] … for BAILEY and Alchemie’s clue … 18/27a Bill Bailey show possibly calms mice you’d stimulated (7,6)[ wordplay: anagram (“stimulated”) of CALMSMICEYOUD ][ definition: Bill Bailey show possibly ] … for MUSICAL COMEDY but before that had only appeared in special cases such as Notabilis’s 2013 clue … 6d Embittered Bill Bailey’s opening in Morecambe, say (7)[ wordplay: abbrev. for ‘bill’, then first letter (“opening”) of BAILEY, inside (“in”) first name of a famous Morecambe ][ AC, then B inside ERIC ][ definition: embittered ] … for ACERBIC, where his name is essentially abstract wordplay. Bailey will remain in crosswords now that he’s in that sweet spot. Two more who found it sweet were folk-rockers the Indigo Girls, who were asked in the 2006 documentary Wordplay what it felt like to be a New York Times answer: Emily Saliers: Oh, man. That’s called the pinnacle of our career. It was a thrill, a total thrill.Amy Ray: I was actually just surprised, because I always thought of us as being pretty underground and not really in the intellectual set. But it was exciting, flattering. I can confirm, as the first summer of the pandemic offered me an amusing moment in the appearance of this in Prospect magazine’s Generalist puzzle … … even in the knowledge that the placement of the letters in my name helpfully filled a pesky gap. Is that one fair, though, I asked myself and decided that crossword references to the world of crosswords are probably their own special category. What about you?

4/11/2022,"Thomas Tuchel has said Chelsea need a “fantastic script” if they are to give the Champions League another dramatic storyline by pulling off an unlikely comeback in their quarter-final tie with Real Madrid. The reigning champions trail 3-1 on aggregate before Tuesday night’s second leg at the Bernabéu and Tuchel remains sceptical about his side’s chances of reaching the last four. The German declared the tie to be all but over in the immediate aftermath of last week’s first leg at Stamford Bridge, and while Chelsea raised their spirits by thumping Southampton 6-0 at the weekend their manager was realistic about his side’s slim hopes before facing Real again. “We need nothing else than a fantastic script if we want to be able to overcome this,” Tuchel said. “The challenge is incredibly high given the circumstances of the first leg and where we play and against whom we play. It’s always allowed to dream and it is sometimes important to imagine things and to dream about it, but it will not shift the focus from the fact that we need to deliver and be ready tomorrow. “It’s worth trying in sports. It’s a beauty of the game that everything is possible always. We will try everything and from there we see. Hopefully belief grows within the match by our actions and hopefully we can fulfil our dream. But realistically we have to invest a lot and be at our very top level.” Tuchel added that Chelsea’s chances of beating Carlo Ancelotti’s side rest on them refusing to accept the tie is over. “What chance do we have?” he said. “Not the biggest chance. But we never manage our effort and belief by the chances we have for a result. Trying means that we will play to the full limit. We will try to be in better shape and better condition than in the first match.” Chelsea travel to Spain without Ross Barkley, Ben Chilwell, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Romelu Lukaku, who has an achilles problem. Cesar Azpilicueta is available after recovering from Covid-19, while Tuchel must decide whether to stick with Timo Werner after the striker’s double against Southampton.",Sport/Football,"Chelsea need ‘fantastic script’ to beat Real Madrid, admits Thomas Tuchel",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/chelsea-need-fantastic-script-to-beat-real-madrid-admits-thomas-tuchel
4/11/2022,"People with disability are packing boxes, cleaning and gardening for legal pay rates as low as $2.27 an hour, a royal commission has heard. The disability royal commission is holding a three-day hearing into Australian Disability Enterprises (ADEs), which provide supported employment to people with moderate to severe disabilities. Senior counsel assisting the commission, Kate Eastman, told the inquiry on Monday it would hear evidence that the lowest wage an hour for a supported employee at one large ADE was $2.27 an hour. The highest rate was $23.85 an hour, while the average rate at that ADE was $6.28 an hour. The national minimum wage is $20.33 an hour. However, the commission heard the low rates of pay are legal, with wages calculated using an assessment tool said to measure the “productivity” of employees. People working in ADEs are also on the disability support pension, which is $987 a fortnight for a single person. Disability advocacy organisations argue ADEs where workers are paid such low wages amount to exploitation and segregation, and hark back to the “sheltered workshops” in which they arose. Most ADE workers have an intellectual disability, though this is not always the case. Eastman said those working at ADEs generally did work such as packaging, gardening, landscaping, cleaning, laundry services, and food services. National Disability Services, which represents some ADEs, has told the inquiry all ADEs would need to shut if they needed to pay award rates, which it claimed would see a “large number” of those people “marginalised from the labour force”. Phillip Shoolman, 67, who is deaf, told the inquiry he had worked in both “open” employment and also at an ADE where he was packing boxes, including packing Easter bags for the Easter show. He said via an interpreter that he had earned $5.65 an hour when he started at the ADE in 2012. The inquiry heard it had reached $12 an hour when he left that job seven years later. Shoolman said he believed he should have been paid more, though insisted there were also positive aspects to the job. His low rate of pay meant he had to watch his finances closely. “I always looked at the cheap stuff and had to really make sure I was in control of my budget,” Shoolman said. Despite the employer being an ADE, Shoolman said there was no interpreter, meaning he and two other deaf people were often lost during work meetings. Mahdi, who is blind, speaks Dari as his first language and has limited English, recounted his experience at an ADE in 2020. His statement to the commission said he initially paid $3.70 an hour working packaging and recycling. He said he was told by staff: “When your work improves your wage can go up to $21 an hour,” but they did not say when. “One of my tasks at the ADE was to open a pallet … and sort those boxes into groups,” his statement said. “I recognised objects by touch and through other senses.” After several requests for a pay rise because his wife and child were soon due to arrive from Afghanistan, the inquiry heard Mahdi was given a wage assessment in February 2021. His wage was lifted to $10 an hour, and when he requested $21 an hour, he was rebuffed. He resigned, citing the low pay. “I’m not working now, currently without the job I feel hopeless,” Mahdi said. “I feel that no one will offer me a job with a fair wage because of my disability. “A wage of $10 an hour is nothing in my opinion,” he added. “I believe the low wages earned by people with disability who work at the ADE is some kind of discrimination and that I was discriminated against.” Catherine McAlpine, chief executive of Inclusion Australia, which represents people with intellectual disability, acknowledged some people did have positive experiences working at ADEs and often felt “valued”. “One of the issues is if you have an intellectual disability and people … say to you, ‘this is what everyone else does,’ but it’s not made clear that no one else goes and does it for $2.50 an hour, it’s actually not the same.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She said there was a $9,000 gap between the disability support pension and the minimum wage. “We think that … governments should top that up and then over a period of a transition period … the wages paid by employers actually pick up appropriately and in a structured manner.” she said. “And the amount that needs to be subsidised by government would decrease.” About 17,000 people, or 7% of all national disability insurance scheme participants, work at ADEs in Australia. ADE workers only started receiving superannuation – paid as the greater of either 9.5% of their earnings or $15 a week – on 1 January 2021. The inquiry continues.

4/11/2022,"Bach’s St Matthew Passion, one of the great masterpieces of the baroque and indeed the whole choral repertoire, never fails to be a moving experience. This performance, with the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales under the direction of conductor Harry Bicket, was no exception, the extremes of cruelty and compassion at its heart all the more poignant in these troubled times. These days, when both this and the St John Passion more often feature small choruses and ensembles, the large assembled chorus at first looked suspiciously hefty. In fact, in the gradual unfolding of the Passion story, the ability of the chorus to negotiate the different colours Bach requires – the sometimes rowdy rabble, mocking, jeering and the chorales, whether questioning or more reflective – added much to the growing dramatic tension over the progress of the work. This concert had first been scheduled for Easter 2020, and reassembling the same lineup of soloists was a plus, though tenor Jeremy Budd in the role of the Evangelist was a late replacement for Gwilym Bowen, who was ill. Budd’s recitatives had great clarity and sensitivity, but, positioned as he was at the centre, just in front of the chamber organ, not always sufficient volume (though the audience for Wednesday’s Radio 3 broadcast will not have that problem). David Shipley was a deeply felt Jesus, the pleas “Mein Vater!” particularly evocative. Mhairi Lawson’s silver tone was a good foil for Jess Dandy’s rich contralto in the work’s single duet and the remarkable intensity of Dandy’s delivery was nowhere more telling than in the aria Können Tränen meiner Wangen Nichts erlangen. Tenor Anthony Gregory brought such a naturally lyrical flow to his contributions that one wished there had been more, while the expressive range of James Newby’s baritone in characterising his various roles, including Judas, Peter and Pontius Pilate, was finely judged, notably his final aria in which Joseph of Arimathaea asks to be allowed to bury Christ’s body. The instrumental solos whose balance with the voices are intrinsic to the beauty of Bach’s conceptions were similarly satisfying. Many of the Passion’s movements are in triple time – Hamburg Ballet has recently collaborated with Los Angeles Opera in a production – and, in Bicket’s expert handling of his considerable forces, the lightly lilting dancing quality he achieved was also a memorable facet.

4/11/2022,"Idream of travelling at near light speed in a spaceship constructed of aluminium, titanium and semolina. My mission is to visit every galaxy in the pasta universe. The ship is also built for time travel and can move through different points over 12,000 years; it encounters the evolution of all the 1,300 pasta shapes that Oretta Zanini De Vita identified in her 2009 Encyclopedia of Pasta; also, shapes not invented yet. I eat them all, while wearing a yolk-coloured spacesuit. Oretta’s phrase “voyage in the pasta universe”, part of the introduction that outlines her research (interviewing very old people about pasta-making traditions), was the one phrase I needed to read in the early days of writing my book about pasta. It summed up the sheer scale of the subject, the historical, geographical and cultural matter, the beauty and the black holes. Then it lightened everything, reminding me I was on a fabulous voyage wearing a yolk-coloured spacesuit (or my yellow boiler suit). From the pasta universe came a jigsaw. Which, to begin with, I imagined as a universe of 1,300 pieces, 300 more than the jigsaw of a dragon I never finished. It was a useful and overwhelming image. It was my partner Vincenzo who reminded me that I wasn’t trying to write the book Oretta had already written, and that you don’t have to say everything in order to tell a story. He suggested I wrote about 50 pasta shapes – 50 pieces that fitted together and made not the jigsaw, but a jigsaw of the pasta universe. Choosing the 50 was a bit like doing a jigsaw itself. I heard Grandma Roddy’s voice and started with the corners – lasagne, tria, maccheroni and gnocchi – then the edges – penne, vermicelli, ravioli, tortellini. After that, I worked my way in, looking out for strong features and patterns – capelli d’angelo and fettuccine, vermicelli and spaghetti, cavatelli and orecchiette, busiate and bucatini; lasagne. Lasagne: there are few things as beautiful, or complete, or that I would rather see arrive in the middle of the table with a big salad and a litre of red wine. Every region has a version, every century a story; it is a galaxy of this universe to explore. The word is thought to derive from the latin lasanum, from the Greek lasanon, both of which mean kitchen pot, which gives us lasanea, or something cooked in a pot. Not that anyone is sure what, exactly, the shape of the thing cooked in the pot was. This uncertainty continues into the middle ages. Then the 14th-century cookbook Liber de Coquina describes dough made into fingers, boiled and layered with cheese – familiar and wonderful. From this description, various forms evolved – some documented, many not – using different dimensions of pasta made from every sort of flour and filling, domestic ingenuity ruling. By the 1800s, lasagne had found its form all over Italy. What was available locally was layered into a celebration; the majestic meat sauce and bechamel lasagne alla bolognese; Neapolitan lasagne di carnevale with meatballs and mozzarella; eel lasagne from Puglia; poppy seed lasagne from Friuli Venezia-Giulia. And nothing has changed: the lasagne galaxy expands, its matter and proportions decided by the dish and its maker. One thing is certain, though: the moment of chaos. Regardless of how well organised you are, there will be one – a moment when you wonder if the mess and number of pans is really worth it. You may even find yourself saying “never again”. But then, once you’ve cleaned up, it is just you and a neat lasagne. You bake it and bring it to the table. And it is beautiful. It is key to rest this six-layer celebratory dish between construction and cooking, and again after baking, to allow the flavours to develop and the lasagne to firm up for slicing.

In a separate, large frying pan, wilt the spinach. Remove from the heat and, once it’s cool, roll into a ball and squeeze out the water before chopping it finely. Mix with the ricotta, three tablespoons of parmesan, salt and pepper. For the bechamel, warm the milk in a saucepan. In another pan (I use a one litre saucepan), melt the butter over a low flame and add the flour. Cook, stirring, for a couple of minutes, until it smells like biscuits. Remove both pans from the heat and slowly whisk the milk into the butter and flour pan. Put back on the heat and stir until it is as dense as thick cream. Bring a pan of water to a fast boil and put three sheets of pasta in at a time. For fresh pasta, cook for just a minute, or according to packet instructions for dried. Quickly lift the pasta on to a clean tea towel to dry – you need some space for this, so have two or three towels laid out ready. Butter a suitable dish – 30cm wide × 40cm long × 6cm deep is ideal. Begin with a layer of pasta, smear it with a little ricotta and spinach, then scatter over some braised veg. Zig-zag with bechamel and sprinkle with parmesan, and finally cover with pasta. Repeat for the next four layers, finishing with pasta, then bechamel, then parmesan. Leave the lasagne to rest for at least two hours and up to 12 (in which case, do so covered in the fridge, then bring it back to room temperature before baking). Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Dot the top of the lasagne with butter and bake for about 20 minutes, or until a light golden crust forms on top. If you like it very golden, put it under a hot grill for another a minute (rather than risking it drying out in the oven). Rest for at least 15 minutes before serving.

4/11/2022,"At the foot of a bell tower on the campus of UC Berkeley, bouquets of flowers, written eulogies and framed photos have piled up as residents mourn the death of a beloved celebrity. But not just any celebrity – a peregrine falcon named Grinnell, whose live-streamed exploits with his partner Annie captured the hearts of thousands of viewers. Scientists at the volunteer organization Cal Falcons have been monitoring the pair for years, broadcasting their daily routines via three cameras situated at the top of the campanile where they nested. Grinnell’s death on 31 March, after apparently being hit by a car, capped a dramatic year for the falcons that included a near fatal attack, a love triangle, a mysterious disappearance, and an unexpected new beginning. And viewers were hooked. The number of people following the couple online rose to more than 20,000, bringing comfort and entertainment in a volatile era. “They became a symbol of hope,” said Lynn Schofield, a biologist with the research nonprofit Institute for Bird Populations, who helps coordinate and monitor the streams. “It was the idea that amid all our messy human affairs, in this time of being so divided, there is something genuinely good that brings everyone together.” The news of Grinnell’s death prompted an outpouring of grief and tributes from dedicated fans as far away as London and Australia, many of whom have watched as the pair – which typically mate for life – raised and fledged five broods of chicks. “I can hardly digest this news,” one user wrote on social media. “There are no words to describe my grief,” another said. Sharon Pollack, a Bay Area viewer who has been following the falcons since 2019, said Grinnell’s death felt like “losing a family member”. For those who count themselves as followers of the falcon cam, the outpouring came as no surprise. The story of Grinnell and Annie began when the pair made their first nest right after the 2016 election. As the pandemic hit and life grew more chaotic, many yearned to get closer to nature, to observe as the pair simply provided for their young and cared for one another, unaware of the global crises unfolding around them. Many viewers say they keep the falcon feed on all day – in the background at work or playing at home for their children – and some even say they wake up in the middle of the night to check on the falcons. The cameras became a constant background stream for Kim Rankin, another Bay Area viewer, after her husband was diagnosed with brain cancer in March 2019. “That spring, as we were absorbing the magnitude of what we were facing, the Cal Falcons were nothing short of a spiritual lifeline for us,” she said. “At this time of year, we have the laptop open on the kitchen counter all day, just so we can watch Annie breathe as she broods. She is my meditation teacher.” Molly, an intensive care unit nurse in Berkeley who declined to share her last name, said she and her family began to watch the live streams in early 2020. As she cared for Covid patients in overwhelmed hospitals, her husband would send her updates. “I was sure I’d bring Covid home to the family, so it was an extremely frightening time for us, as for many,” she said. “It got us through in a lot of ways to watch the relationship of Annie and Grinnell. To watch the eggs hatch and to watch the chicks develop and fledge.” But the exploits of Annie and Grinnell weren’t always a peaceful solace. In late 2021, the falcon footage took an alarming turn, coming to more closely resemble a telenovela than the gentle, meditative streams of years past. New falcons in the area increasingly fought the resident birds for their territory, culminating in stunning mid-air battles. As a result of one such attack, Grinnell was found injured on campus in November 2021, unable to fly, and was taken to a local animal hospital to recover. During his absence, Annie shocked viewers by shacking up with one of his attackers. “Grinnell, hurry up and get your girl back!” one commenter wrote. “Annie, don’t fall for this scheming Lothario! He’s up to no good!” said another. Grinnell returned to the nest to reclaim his mate, and the competitor flew off. All was briefly well in the world – until Annie disappeared. Missing for more than a week, she was declared dead before defying all expectations and returning. “This is something that is totally unexpected and goes against pretty much everything we’ve seen,” the scientists wrote. “Queen Annie appears to be back.” While the volatility has been difficult to stomach, scientists say it also represents a positive upturn for the peregrine falcon, which nearly went extinct in the 20th century due to the widespread use of the toxic insecticide DDT. By the time the chemical was banned in 1972, only a handful of falcon nests existed in the western United States. “We don’t know if this level of competition for territory is typical because 50 years ago there were no falcons to compete with one another,” said Schofield. “In a sense, this major strife is a sign that the species has truly recovered.” Compounding the grief surrounding Grinnell’s death, the pair had just produced a brood of eggs – one that could not be successfully reared with one parent. But when it seemed all was doomed, a new character entered the series in typically dramatic fashion. A new unknown male – with a distinctive injured left leg – was seen hanging around the nest. While falcons are typically territorial and quick to chase away interlopers, Annie seemed to be tolerating the visitor. “When a mated peregrine dies during the breeding season, the most likely outcome is nest failure,” the scientists wrote in an Instagram post days after Grinnell’s death. “In rare cases, a new mate can come in, establish a bond with the remaining individual, and adopt the chicks. It is possible that we are witnessing this right now.” Even as they grieve Grinnell’s loss, viewers are finding themselves endeared to the new falcon stepdad, despite themselves. In the past week he has defended the nest from other birds, sat on the eggs, and delivered a large mourning dove for breakfast. The new bird and Annie were seen copulating before she laid a third egg – meaning her offspring may now have two different biological fathers. “A truly blended Berkeley family,” one user commented. “Life finds a way,” said another. Cal Falcons scientists are inviting viewers to name the new bird in an online competition. Among the top suggestions is Alden, a nod to museum director Alden Lewis, who succeeded Grinnell’s namesake Joseph Grinnell as head of the campus museum of vertebrate zoology in 1940. Many say they are undeterred by the ups and downs of the past year, and will continue to see how “new guy” and Annie’s brood fare. Lizz Lagomarsino, a dedicated viewer for the past four years, found fresh hope after seeing a new family taking shape. After Grinnell’s death, she went into mourning, and found herself watching nonstop “until the social media feed confirmed this [new] guy was maybe going to work out”. Lagomarsino and others hope their favorite story isn’t over yet. “Nature … falcons at the campanile … not for the faint of heart,” she said. “But you cannot find a better reality show right now.”",News/Environment,‘The best reality TV’: how a falcon couple’s saga mesmerized a human audience,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/11/peregrine-falcons-grinnell-annie-captivated-audience
4/11/2022,"In 2007, Anna found herself struggling through a period of depression. Although she enjoyed living in London and working in wine PR, she started to reevaluate. “My life wasn’t what I wanted any more,” she says. She started making an effort to spend more time with friends and was beginning to feel more positive. One evening, she decided to go to the nightclub Plastic People in Shoreditch, east London, where DJ Theo Parrish was playing. Not long after she arrived, she spotted a tall, handsome man wearing a trilby. Feeling confident, she went to speak to him. “I saw this striking woman and I really liked that she came over,” says Marcus. “If someone is brave enough to make an approach, I’m going to listen.” At the time, he was working on a community project to support young people, and remembers feeling exhausted. “My flatmate had dragged me out. I’d been single for a few months and, although I wasn’t necessarily looking for a girlfriend, I was open to new adventures.” “He told me he was from Suffolk and I asked if he’d ever caught crabs in Walberswick, which made him laugh,” says Anna. They kissed and exchanged numbers that night. “I came home to my flatmate and told her I’d met my future husband because we clicked instantly,” she says. A week later they went on a date to the South Bank, but she left feeling less sure that he was the One. “I thought he was a bit arrogant. He’s quite opinionated and stubborn,” she says. Despite the shaky first date, she wanted to give him another chance and they met up in Stoke Newington for drinks and food, before heading back to Anna’s flat. “I felt I’d met someone I could have something great with,” says Marcus. “Although we had a funny moment when I went to her house and there were plates in her bed. I thought her flat had been broken into,” he laughs. He soon worked out she was just messy, but it didn’t matter. “I loved her character and energy.” On the second date, Anna realised she had misinterpreted his confidence as arrogance. “The conversation was really easy. We both have eclectic taste in music and love travelling and being outdoors,” she says. They took things slowly for the next few months, before planning a trip to Australia and Japan in January 2008. “It was brilliant,” says Marcus. That summer, she moved into his flat in south London. At the start of 2010 they got engaged. “I was starring in Vinderella, a charity pantomime themed around wine which I became involved with through work,” says Anna. “After the show, Marcus got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.” They tied the knot in September that year on the Suffolk/Essex border. “We found a barn that someone had just opened for weddings,” says Anna. “Next to the barn there was a tiny 10th-century chapel. When we got home, we discovered some of my ancestors had been married in that church in the 18th century, so it was the ideal place for us to say our vows.” In 2011, Anna was offered a job in Madrid and the couple moved there for eight years before returning to London. During that time, they had two children: Theo, born in 2013 and named after the DJ who was playing on the night they met, and Max, born in 2017. Anna now has a wine marketing and translation business, which she started in 2015, while Marcus manages a cultural and business programme for creative industries in London. They moved to rural Suffolk during the pandemic to be closer to family. Marcus admires his wife’s resilience. “When we both roll up our sleeves and crack on, we make things happen. She is unfailingly kind and has buffed away my sharp edges, and made me a better person,” he says. “She has also introduced me to the finer things in life, like good wine and food.” Anna says Marcus is one of the most intelligent people she knows. “I always find his wit and intellect stimulating,” she says. “He was fostered, then adopted, and has come from a difficult background. I really admire his drive and that helped me to start the business. We also make a great team as parents.” Want to share your story?

4/11/2022,"Gloria has installed herself in the attic. For good. Her daughter has upped sticks to Australia, she’s barely on speaking terms with her husband and the turkey has “murdered” her mother. Victoria Willing’s latest play bristles with the same deadpan darkness as her breakthrough show, Spring Offensive. It’s held together by a sharp sense of humour and truthfulness but could do with a bit more fire in the belly. Surrounded by dust and debris, in an economically effective set from Alys Whitehead, Gloria sits on a deckchair with her daylight lamp turned on full blast. She’s a woman on permanent holiday from reality. Debra Baker does well to bring light and shade to the central role but she’s a little muted. While Gloria is clearly struggling with depression, she’s also an ex-punk with a vicious temper who is more than capable, you sense (in all too brief glimpses), of burning everything to the ground if only she would rouse herself and light the match. The dialogue never feels as alive as Gloria’s monologues but there are fleeting moments of insight: the ugly liaisons with ghastly leftie neighbour Daniel, played with glowing smugness by Lucas Hare; the delicate sparks of affection with Gloria’s burned-out husband Graham (Kevin N Golding); the straight-talking relationship with eastern European best friend Magda, performed with biting precision by Izabella Urbanowicz. The scenes are tied together with an increasingly ropey plot and the energy of Marie McCarthy’s production never lifts beyond a hard-working hum. That’s a shame because there are some provocative ideas in here – particularly about how women can feel hidden in plain sight, lost in the heart of their own home. At the Omnibus theatre, London, until 30 April.",Arts/Stage,Sad review – a woman on holiday from reality,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/11/sad-review-a-woman-on-holiday-from-reality
