4/18/2022,"President Biden and his immediate predecessor issued Easter messages that were as different as the men themselves. Other living presidents weighed in as well. Biden, who wished the nation a “Happy Easter” on Twitter, invoked the teachings of Christian savior Jesus Christ in his missive. “As we reflect today on Christ’s Resurrection, we are reminded that with faith, hope, and love — even death can be defeated,” the president tweeted. “From our family to yours, we wish you hope, health, joy, and the peace of God, which passes all understanding. Happy Easter and may God bless and keep you.” Easter is a Christian festival commemorating the resurrection of Jesus three days after his death by crucifixion. For many Christians, Easter weekend is the end to the Lenten season of fasting and penitence. Former president Donald Trump used the holiday to launch a passive-aggressive attack on his perceived enemies on Earth, including New York attorney general Letitia James, whose office is investigating Trump. “May she remain healthy despite the fact that she will continue to drive business out of New York while at the same time keeping crime, death, and destruction in New York!” reads a message from Trump’s Save America political action committee, which also calls James a “racist.” Trump was banned from Twitter following the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by his followers. “Happy Easter to all including the Radical Left Maniacs who are trying everything to destroy our country,” reads a second message Trump’s PAC. “May they not succeed, but let them, nevertheless, be happy, healthy, wealthy and well!” The 45th president’s message is similar in tone to his Easter greeting from 2021, where he baselessly alleged the 2020 election he lost to Biden by more than 7-million votes had been “rigged” against him. Trump continues pushing that claim in 2022. In 2013, prior to getting involved in politics, Trump commemorated the 12th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center that left nearly 3,000 people dead with a tweet of the same nature. “I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th,” he wrote. Former president Barack Obama wished Americans a Happy Passover on Friday and a “blessed and joyful Easter” on Sunday. “After a difficult couple of years, let’s give thanks for all the gifts we enjoy — and the people who make this life special,” the 44th president tweeted. The Jimmy Carter Presidential Library also tweeted a “Happy Easter” wish along with a photo of a White House Easter Bunny, circa 1977. Former president Bill Clinton had not posted an Easter message by noon Sunday, but former First Lady Hillary Clinton took to Twitter wishing everyone a “Happy Easter” along with a photo of the two of them with an Easter Bunny.",Politics/NY Daily News,Biden and Trump release very different Easter messages,https://news.yahoo.com/biden-trump-release-very-different-202600019.html
4/18/2022,"A physical therapist from Connecticut was convicted on Thursday of killing his wife, their three children, and family dog because an “apocalypse was coming.” NBC News reports Anthony John Todt, 46, has been found guilty of four counts of first-degree murder for the killings of his wife Megan, 42, as well as their kids Zoe, 4, Tyler, 11, and Aleksander, 13. Todt has also been charged with one count of animal cruelty, for slaying the family dog, Breezy. Todt will receive a mandatory life sentence, as prosecutors weren’t seeking the death penalty. Prosecution says Todt told deputies they brought the kids into this world, and they should be in control of when they leave this world. Referencing control again. — Lauren Cervantes (@LaurenNews6) April 14, 2022 The killings took place two years ago in central Florida. Authorities believe the victims were murdered sometime after they were last seen in mid-December 2019. Police found their decomposing bodies wrapped in blankets at the Todt home on Jan. 13, 2020. “I was covering for my wife,” Todt told the jury when he took the stand in his defense. “Obviously, unsuccessfully. I had no clue how my kids died.” Assistant Public Defender Alesha Smith claims that Todt “came home to his kids being dead, his wife was alive but essentially dying, and stabbed herself in front of him.” Following his arrest, Todt told detectives that “everybody needed to die in order to pass over to the other side together because the apocalypse was coming.”",World/Complex,"Physical Therapist From Connecticut Convicted of Killing Wife, Three Children Because 'Apocalypse Was Coming'",https://news.yahoo.com/physical-therapist-connecticut-convicted-killing-191013954.html

4/18/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — Three Chinese astronauts returned to Earth on Saturday after six months aboard their country's newest orbital station in the longest crewed mission to date for China's ambitious space program. The Shenzhou 13 space capsule landed in the Gobi desert in the northern region of Inner Mongolia, shown live on state TV. During the mission, astronaut Wang Yaping carried out the first spacewalk by a Chinese woman. Wang and crewmates Zhai Zhigang and Ye Guangfu beamed back physics lessons for high school students. China launched its first astronaut into space in 2003 and landed robot rovers on the moon in 2013 and on Mars last year. Officials have discussed a possible crewed mission to the moon. On Saturday, state TV showed images from inside the capsule as it traveled at 200 meters per second over Africa before entering the atmosphere. The trio were the second crew aboard Tiangong, or Heavenly Palace. Its core module, Tianhe, was launched in April 2021. Plans call for completing construction this year by adding two more modules. Authorities have yet to announce a date for launching the next Tiangong crew. China is excluded from the International Space Station due to U.S. unease that its space program is run by the ruling Communist Party’s military wing, the People’s Liberation Army. China was the third nation to launch an astronaut into space on its own after the former Soviet Union and the United States. Tiangong is China’s third space station following predecessors launched in 2011 and 2016. The government announced in 2020 that China's first reusable spacecraft had landed following a test flight but no photos or details of the vehicle have been released. On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping visited the launch site in Wenchang on the southern island of Hainan from which the Tianhe module was fired into orbit. “Persist in pursuing the frontiers of world aerospace development and the major strategic needs of national aerospace,” Xi told staff at the site, all of them in military uniform.",World/Associated Press,Chinese astronauts land after 6 months on space station,https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-astronauts-land-6-months-020336887.html
