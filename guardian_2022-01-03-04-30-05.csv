1/3/2022,"Nothing beats the New Zealand bush. The writer Ashleigh Young once tweeted: “Sometimes NZ writers say ‘the forest’ instead of ‘the bush’ (and they definitely mean ‘the bush’) because they are nervous about saying ‘the bush’. Bring back the bush. If everyone does it, we will be fine.” So here I am, proclaiming, “I love the bush!” Perhaps this is my opinion as an outdoor enthusiast and bisexual, but “bush” is the more accurate descriptor for the native flora of Aotearoa. Our bush is dense and scratchy, inured to the trample of boots. Our bush is thick and lush all year round, as few native plant species are deciduous. Our bush is not some wan forest: it is wild and overgrown, it does not encourage easy passage.  As my family were neither middle class nor Pākehā (white European), I didn’t venture into the bush until I was an adult. It’s now been 10 years since my first foray into the bush but I’ll never forget that first experience. A friend, who grew up with the bush, convinced me to come on a two-day tramp. I had no idea what I was getting into. Surely a tramp was just a long walk. How difficult could a walk in the bush possibly be? I lacked outdoor gear but my friend sorted me with her spares, save for tramping boots as our feet were not the same size. “Maybe I’ll get into tramping,” I decided, buying the cheapest pair of boots I could find. The route was up Avalanche Peak, the only poled summit in Arthur’s Pass, a national park famous for its bush of silver, red and mountain tawhai (beech) trees. I did not appreciate the bush on the way up. Instead, I cursed the 1,100m ascent that left my lungs burning and back saturated with sweat. I envied my friend’s fitness that allowed her to walk ahead and find features of the bush to show me: the peat floor carpeted with prickly shield fern, the sponge moss and lace lichen, and the understorey of snow totara, bearing edible cashew apple-shaped berries. I thought the uphill would be the hardest part but then I discovered what happens once you leave the bush. Past the bushline, the tall trees were replaced by stout, hardy shrubs. Some people refer to this as alpine scrub but I think you could equally call it alpine bush. This alpine bush featured plants I had never seen before, like the Mount Cook lily, with bristly white petals and leaves as tough as leather. This bush was patchy and uneven to walk on, and somehow I was as slow on the flat as I was uphill. Soon, the alpine bush too disappeared, and the only vegetation was the moss and lichen that grew on the rock and shingle we crunched underfoot. My friend pointed out a fan of broken rock, ranging from palm-sized to head-sized, that dropped down into an open plain. We had to get down that scree slope to get to our accommodation for the night. There’s an art to running down scree slopes, which my friend demonstrated, where one “surfs” along the surface of the debris. She pulled away like a motor boat from a jetty, generating a clattering wave of cascading rock, leaving me to tread cautiously in her wake. I tried to replicate her movements but I fell repeatedly until I gave up. I sat on my bum and thought back to earlier in the day. I never fell in the bush. The bush was sheltered, the bush was safe. I wished I was back in the bush. I ended up bum-shuffling my way down the slope, tearing up the seat of my cotton shorts in the process. Thankfully that first trip didn’t put me off tramping and since then I’ve visited bush all around the country. There’s the bush of Kahurangi national park, which looks blue from a distance, and the goblin forests of Taranaki, named for the gnarled trees and the mosses that hang off them. I can now enjoy the cool, crisp air of the bush around me and look forward to where it may take me. Rose Lu is a writer, software developer and cable car owner from Wellington.

1/3/2022,"It had been tempting to fixate on Thomas Tuchel’s decision to drop Romelu Lukaku from the Chelsea squad after that interview. But it was a measure of what followed once the first whistle had blown that the club’s record signing – and all the drama around him – was swiftly relegated to footnote status. Tuchel said that he did not select Lukaku because his situation had represented too much of a distraction – what with him saying that he was unhappy at the club and questioning the manager’s system. Not for the first time, Chelsea coped pretty well without him.  During a thrilling first-half, they rallied from two goals down, restoring parity through a Mateo Kovacic wonder goal and a tidy finish from Christian Pulisic. When Chelsea can summon this sort of surge, it makes a mockery of their recent Premier League form, which now shows only four wins out of nine. Liverpool played a full part in a richly entertaining spectacle, their goals coming from Sadio Mané and Mohamed Salah; the former snapping a nine-game scoring drought, the latter continuing his red-hot touch. Both of them now depart for the Africa Cup of Nations, providing the latest curve ball for Jürgen Klopp, who was missing here after testing positive for Covid. Never mind that the second-half did not match the first, both teams still had the chances to snatch victory and yet, as the dust settled, there was one manager who was the happiest of all. It was Manchester City’s Pep Guardiola, who can now see a ten-point lead over Chelsea and 11 over Liverpool, albeit the latter have a game in hand. The match had been framed by City’s last-gasp win at Arsenal on New Year’s Day – a result to reinforce the feeling that it looks set to be City’s season – and victory here had felt essential for both of these teams. Then there were the absentees, with Liverpool hit by the losses of the Covid positives Alisson, Joel Matip and Roberto Firmino – not to mention Klopp. The Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, who is also in Covid-enforced isolation, had said that he would need a “big room” to watch the City game. What about Klopp here? A country estate? It was easy to imagine him charging around in the ninth minute when Mane gave Liverpool the lead, whereas Trevoh Chalobah, who had started nervously for Chelsea, simply wanted the ground to swallow him up. The centre-half got himself into a tangle when Diogo Jota clipped the ball forward, electing to stoop and try to head clear even though it was there for the volley. He succeeded only in ushering in Mané, who sliced inside Édouard Mendy before slamming his shot past César Azpilicueta on the line. It was a ruthless demonstration of how to finish and Pulisic, in particular, would not have enjoyed it. The Chelsea winger had been presented with a similar chance moments earlier after Kai Havertz charged down a Trent Alexander-Arnold clearance. Collecting the ricochet, Pulisic tried to jink inside Caoimhin Kelleher only for the Liverpool stand-in goalkeeper to snake out a hand and paw clear. Mané had earlier flirted with disaster, raising his elbow as he chased a high ball forward from kick-off and making contact with Azpilicueta, who crumpled to the ground. What saved Mané was that he did not jump or swing the arm. He was booked. Tuchel raged in his technical area. Salah shimmered with menace and went close in the sixth minute after Chalobah’s loose header to Mané, who ran and crossed. It needed a saving challenge from Antonio Rudiger to deny Salah, the ball then flying towards goal and requiring a block by Mendy. Salah’s goal was a beauty, starting with the touch to kill an Alexander-Arnold pass up the right. Salah froze Marcos Alonso with a shake of the hips and then, having opened up his body, he whipped an unstoppable shot past Mendy and into the near corner. Chelsea were becoming aggrieved with the referee, Anthony Taylor – not a popular figure in these parts – and they needed an important slide tackle from Chalobah to stop the breaking Salah in the 36th minute. At that point, the notion that Chelsea would be level at the interval was outlandish. But they got there after Kovacic’s wonderful volley from the edge of the area. Kelleher had punched clear from Alonso’s free-kick and Kovacic set himself as it dropped, placing the ball with the laces of his right boot up and in off the far post. With Stamford Bridge in a frenzy, Rudiger stepped up to rob Salah and, when N’Golo Kanté helped the ball on, Pulisic was once again one on one with Kelleher. This time, the finish was true and there was still time before half-time for Mason Mount to stab past the far post. It was riotous entertainment and the second-half was fired by an awareness that the draw did not suit either team. Both of them pushed, with Liverpool running through Chelsea on a number of occasions before seeing belatedly raised offside flags. Mendy was forced to save then – when he did not really have to – but he made other interventions when he certainly did. He will be a loss for Chelsea when he departs for the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal. His save to beat away a Salah lob on 57 minutes took the breath, chasing back to claw to safety, while he was alert to deny Mané moments later. Alonso had shot wastefully shortly after the restart, while Chelsea could also point to a Pulisic effort in the 60th minute from an Alonso cross that drew an excellent save out of Kelleher.",Sport/Football,Chelsea and Liverpool trade blows in thrilling draw but City the real winners,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/02/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
1/3/2022,"A crunch week in Prince Andrew’s fight to avoid a public trial over claims he sexually assaulted a 17-year-old trafficked by the convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein begins on Monday, when a New York court unseals a confidential 2009 deal between Epstein and the alleged victim. Lawyers for the Duke of York, who “unequivocally denies” the claims made by Virginia Giuffre, believe her agreement with Epstein could shield him from her civil lawsuit accusing him of sexual abuse in 2001.  Epstein, a former friend of the Duke of York, was convicted of sex offences in 2008 and killed himself while in jail in 2019 awaiting trial on further sex trafficking charges. His close associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, 60, also a former friend of Prince Andrew, was last week convicted of sex trafficking in a federal court in New York and faces up to 65 years in prison. After the unsealing of the deal, lawyers for Prince Andrew will argue to Judge Lewis A Kaplan, sitting at the US district court in the southern district of New York in lower Manhattan, that the agreement between Giuffre and Epstein means she cannot take action against their client. Lawyers for Giuffre, known as Virginia Roberts when she claims she was introduced to the prince, have dismissed the attempts to halt the civil case as “just another in a series of tired attempts by Prince Andrew to duck and dodge the legal merits of the case”. But Prince Andrew’s lawyers have told the court that Giuffre is pursuing a “baseless lawsuit against Prince Andrew to achieve another payday at his expense” and that “sensationalism and innuendo have prevailed over the truth”. They claim his “sullied reputation” is collateral damage of the Epstein scandal. At stake is not just Prince Andrew’s future and Giuffre’s pursuit of justice, but the international reputation of the British royal family. Buckingham Palace on Sunday denied as “uninformed speculation” reports that courtiers may have to ask Prince Andrew to stop using his title if he loses the lawsuit brought by Giuffre. It said it would not comment on ongoing legal matters and also played down reports he would have to step back from his role as colonel-in-chief of nine military regiments, units and corps. In other developments, Ghislaine Maxwell’s brother Ian Maxwell, 65, said she maintained her innocence and had no plans to cut a deal with prosecutors to provide evidence against other people who were involved in her and Epstein’s sexual abuse. “Prosecution confirmed no plea bargain offers were made or received” before the trial, he told the Sunday Times. “I expect that position to be maintained.” He also said his sister was not a suicide risk as she awaits sentencing. It also emerged Giuffre could be permitted to deliver a victim impact statement at Maxwell’s sentencing. Sigrid McCawley, a lawyer for Giuffre, told the Daily Telegraph that she anticipates the court will hear from “many, many other women who were not able to be heard at the trial”. And Giuffre’s lawyer, David Boies, told the Mail on Sunday that there are “four, five, six witnesses” capable of placing Giuffre together with Prince Andrew. The Duke told the BBC in 2019 that he had “no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever”. Prince Andrew’s lawyer, Andrew Brettler, has told the court that Giuffre’s agreement with Epstein provided “a general release of all claims against him and numerous other individuals and entities” and that Prince Andrew is “axiomatically among the releasees”. The same agreement was the basis for Giuffre agreeing to dismiss a battery claim against the lawyer Alan Dershowitz earlier this year, Brettler said. He will also argue that the case should be thrown out because Giuffre, a US citizen, no longer lives in the US. If the judge orders the case to continue, Prince Andrew could ultimately face a trial involving him making a statement under oath. Prince Andrew claimed in a 2019 BBC Newsnight interview that he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on the day in 2001 that Giuffre claims she was with him at the Tramp nightclub. He also addressed her claims that he was sweaty at the nightclub by saying he was incapable of sweating at that time because of an “overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war”. But asked for evidence of both things by Giuffre’s legal team, his lawyers have as yet put nothing forward, according to court documents.",News/UK news,Court to unseal deal between Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia Giuffre,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/02/court-to-unseal-deal-between-jeffrey-epstein-and-virginia-giuffre
1/3/2022,"Eric Adams’s first two days in office would resonate with any weary New York commuter: a subway ride featuring a brawl requiring the attendance of police, then the challenge of negotiating Manhattan traffic on a rented bike.  “This is an amazing city,” the new mayor told ABC on Sunday. “You know, riding a city bike in, taking the train in, interacting with New Yorkers: generals don’t lead their troops from the back. “They lead their troops from the front. I’m going to lead my city into this victory from the front. And people tell me this is a difficult job. Darn it, I want it to be a difficult job.” Significant challenges await the newly sworn-in leader of the most populous US city, a Democrat who trounced the Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa in November to become New York’s second Black mayor after David Dinkins, who was in office from 1990 to 1993. “New York can and should be the center of the universe again,” said Adams in an inaugural address themed largely around getting to grips with an Omicron-fueled coronavirus surge that has slowed parts of the city to a crawl. The police and fire departments are reporting sickness rates of around 20% and three subway lines have been suspended because of staff shortages. Adams succeeds as mayor Bill de Blasio, another Democrat who despite becoming hugely unpopular has signalled a run for governor. The city, the new mayor said, had endured “two years of continuous crisis, and that insults our very nature as New Yorkers”. On Saturday, hours after his midnight swearing-in ceremony in Times Square, the 61-year-old rode the subway to work, greeting residents and calling 911 to report a brawl between three men. By the time officers arrived, the fight – witnessed by reporters accompanying the mayor – was over. Adams, a cop himself for 22 years, said he wished police had stuck around longer. On Sunday he was up early again, cycling to City Hall and an appearance on ABC’s This Week in which he called on New Yorkers to get vaccinated and boosted. “It’s going to prevent you from dying,” he said. “It’s going to alleviate the possibility of you being hospitalised and going on a ventilator. “To those who are not vaccinated: ‘Stop it. It’s time to get vaccinated. It’s time to have the booster shots. You’re endangering yourself and you’re endangering the public and your family as well’.” Adams, who is keeping de Blasio’s vaccine mandate for private employers, said consideration of a booster mandate for city employees including cops, firefighters and sanitation workers was “our next move and decision”. His host, George Stephanopoulos, challenged Adams on his campaign pledge to tackle soaring crime rates, especially gun violence. “The balance is not just heavy-handed policing, it’s public safety and justice,” Adams said. “We’re going to go after gangs, we’re going to take down some of the large gangs in our city. We’re going to zero in on gangs. We’re going to reinstitute a plainclothes anti-gun unit and zero in on those guns.”",News/US news,‘Generals don’t lead from the back’: New York mayor Eric Adams seeks bold start ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/02/new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-seeks-bold-start
1/3/2022,"Though at times it can feel hard to believe – especially in recent weeks, perhaps – this pandemic will not last for ever. With more than 5 million dead and huge economic and social costs, its toll has been immense, and unnecessarily so. Secrecy in China, complacency in Europe, reckless and callous rightwing populism in the US and Brazil, and the inequity in vaccine distribution have all contributed. Yet if we learn its lessons, we will be better prepared next time. For there will be a next time. Covid is not a once-in-a-century crisis – an idea encouraged by its arrival 101 years after the last major pandemic, the “Spanish” flu, which killed at least 50 million. The mega-flu outbreak that many experts had seen as the next great threat is no less likely to arrive because Covid got here first. A pandemic of similar scale is likely within the next six decades, and could happen at any point in that timespan, according to research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in August; others have put the risk of a comparable crisis within the next decade at around one in four. And as Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert, the creator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca jab, warned recently: “The next one could be worse. It could be more contagious, or more lethal, or both.”  The price we pay then will depend on what we do now, using Covid’s lessons. We have seen international scientific collaboration, incredible dedication by researchers and healthcare staff, and the ability and willingness of local and national communities to pull together. Richer nations will be less likely to take health security for granted. Covid-19 has also shown that the right decisions at the right time can make a profound difference. With a dozen direct flights from Wuhan each week, Taiwan was heavily exposed to risk. But, driven by the experience of the 2002-03 Sars epidemic, it rapidly introduced health screening for arrivals, border controls, effective contact tracing and mask-wearing, and gave its citizens clear and consistent messages. Fewer than 900 of its 22 million-strong population have died. Yet the global response has too often looked like a triumph of science and a failure of politics. The wishful thinking seen in the first wave has been repeated again and again. And the way we live is increasing the risks of another major pandemic. The aforementioned research published in August in PNAS estimated that the probability of novel disease outbreaks will grow threefold in the next few decades. International trade and travel allow diseases to spread far more quickly. Some scientists argue that we have already entered another great pandemic: a wave of antimicrobial resistance that could see tens of millions die from currently treatable diseases, coming gradually, but ultimately proving far more punishing than the sudden Covid crisis. The overuse of antibiotics to treat humans and livestock is endangering us all. Both the frequency and severity of “spillover” events, where diseases jump from animals to humans, have increased as we encroach on and destroy animal habitats. Zoonotic diseases, transmitted from animals, represent around three-quarters of newly emerging diseases. And research suggests that, as many species become extinct, those that thrive are more likely to be ones known to host pathogens dangerous to humans. Though all this is frequently presented as a developing-world issue, the global north is responsible too. Deforestation is often driven by the cultivation of crops for export. The focus on the perils of “bush meat” and “wet markets” has not been matched by attention to the risks posed by intensive, industrialised farming. Humans will come into even closer contact with nature as global heating reduces available land, and will be pushed into denser habitation and forced to move en masse. Existing diseases such as chikungunya may spread, as warmer temperatures allow their insect carriers to move into new areas. Covid would have been far worse without the pandemic preparations that countries had been making for years, however inadequate they proved. Many of the proposals now are essentially for more (or a better version) of the same, focusing on data collection and analysis, improvements to public health communication and exploratory work that could accelerate the development of vaccines and treatments. Above all, experts warn that there needs to be a massive expansion of surveillance to detect novel pathogens. An expert panel convened by the G20 has called for a doubling of international financing to tackle major weaknesses in surveillance and other pandemic preparedness requirements, to $15bn a year. The price tag is tiny set beside the cost of Covid, but many fear that even now our leaders are reluctant to spend enough. Specific preparations to fend off or tackle another pandemic could mean everything from better protective gear for abattoir workers to rethinking the ventilation requirements of buildings. But protecting ourselves also requires far more fundamental reassessments. Beyond addressing the climate crisis, it means prioritising public health and acting on what the pandemic has demonstrated so graphically: that inequality – both within and between nations – kills; and it kills mostly, but not solely, the poor. Covid (and especially the Omicron variant) has shown that we cannot isolate ourselves from the physical or economic effects of disease elsewhere. By hogging vaccines and opposing patent waivers, wealthier nations have imperilled their own citizens too. They should think again, and make amends by helping to improve regional manufacturing capacity for tests, vaccines and treatments. Since global solutions are needed, it is positive that the World Health Assembly has agreed that work should begin on a pandemic accord covering prevention, preparedness and response, even if its parameters fall short of the tougher treaty that many hoped for. Finally, we must address questions of trust, and tackle the fissures in our societies – in many ways deepened by Covid. The challenge is truly daunting. But so is the alternative: “What we are going through is also a crisis of meanings,” Elif Shafak has written. “Do we want to go back to the way things were before the pandemic? Was that really normal?” The risk is to our bodily health as well as our wellbeing in the broader sense that Shafak describes. Covid has reminded us that disease is a social as well as a physical phenomenon, produced and shaped by the ways we live. Will we do what is needed to protect ourselves?",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the next pandemic: can we learn Covid’s lessons? | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-next-pandemic-can-we-learn-covids-lessons
