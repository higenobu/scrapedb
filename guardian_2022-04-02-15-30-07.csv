4/2/2022,"You Won’t Be Alone is one of the most extraordinary films I’ve seen, or rather experienced, in recent memory, a deeply unusual and deeply emotive drama about a witch discovering how to be human by taking over the bodies of others in rural 19th century Macedonia. It’s part gruesome body horror, part dreamy fairytale, part exercise in existentialism and extreme empathy told mostly through strange, fractured narration from someone learning what language is and means as they navigate an often barbaric yet often beautiful world. It’s really quite something. “You’re gonna realise I’m an idiot really quickly,” director Goran Stolevski says, laughing, at the start of our Zoom conversation with disarming, and ultimately unwarranted, nervousness. The 36-year-old Macedonian-Australian film-maker, who quickly reveals himself to be very much not an idiot, traces the nerves back to my ebullient five-star review of his debut feature, which premiered at this year’s virtual Sundance film festival in January. His film has the lived-in feeling of an old, oft-told folk tale or a dusty, dog-eared novel but is in fact, a true original. Stolevski, who had spent years making modest shorts (he refers to himself as “the most failed film-maker who’s ever failed” before his breakout), was living in Bristol when the idea came to him. He was about to turn 30, one year into a three year period of unemployment, and as a gay migrant, he felt like an outsider, often not speaking to anyone but his husband for weeks. He was also reading a lot of Virginia Woolf … “Virginia was helping me feel less isolated,” he tells me. “What she does with words to capture consciousness or innocence, I was really wondering how you could do that with cinema? I wanted to do something with a particular feeling I had at the time and then try to capture this way of life that’s now pretty much disappeared and to document that in all of its beauty and ugliness.” He’d been researching folk tales from his homeland but was finding them mostly unhelpful. Female characters were usually sidelined, told to stay in the kitchen and then to shut up and get to work, and instead he found more inspiration from studying witchcraft and how such legends allowed for women to transgress even if such transgression would often lead to severe punishment. “I think I have the brain of what is commonly known as ‘a difficult woman’ so witches are just a natural thing to me,” he says. “I think if I lived in this time and place, I would be the person who wanted to live differently because I would want more out of life and I would be burned at the stake for sure. I’m not sure which gender they would think I am but either way they would call me a witch.” The journey taken by the film’s protagonist – through the bodies and lives of a woman (played by Noomi Rapace), a dog, a man and a child – becomes a frustrating, foundational lesson on gender and power. What can a man get away with that a woman cannot? What is expected from women that isn’t from men? Stolevski, as a young gay kid, always gravitated towards “the stubborn girls” who refused to accept such regressive restrictions. “I learned a sense of unfairness before I even understood the concept of fairness,” he tells me, recalling stories as a child of when girls were made to do the chores that the “lazy as fuck” boys were able to evade. There’s a distinct queerness to the film, with its narrative of being a misunderstood outsider, and while Stolevski denies any conscious process of making the film queer, he admits it’s an undeniable part of his work. “It all works out of instinct,” he says. “I always insist that I don’t write autobiographically because I’m not interested in seeing myself specifically reflected. I’m more interested in seeing if my brain, if my essence, was transported into this other person in a completely different time and a completely different place, how would I cope, what would I come up against as a border or a limit, how would I try to figure out my way around it?” He adds that “the queerness obviously, I just trust it comes out” with a laugh. Before he decided to go witching, his short films had been predominantly relationship dramas (he admits this “started partly out of practicality as when you’re nothing and no one trying to make movies you sort of need to go, what can be achievable?”) so horror was not an obvious place to go for his full-length debut, especially given his tendency to be rather squeamish. You Won’t Be Alone might only play with horror tropes rather than being a horror in the traditional sense but there’s no such half-measures when it comes to the gore. Bodies are ripped and slashed open, innards are torn and pored over, it’s never explicit exactly, more matter-of-fact, but there’s very little left to one’s imagination. “You kind of tap into this creative frequency and then the movie takes over and was directing me,” he says. “I have an appetite for making sure I don’t shield myself from any part of life. I do trekking but I have a morbid fear of heights and I’ll get to the top of a mountain and literally I’m taking a fucking photo like this [he looks away while pretending to take a picture] because I have to have a photo and it needs to look good. It’s kind of like the way I take photos from a big height, dealing with the gore.” Even scarier than dealing with the gore? Dealing with bad reviews. Although the film might have found much acclaim at Sundance and in the months since (it’s currently at a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes), as a self-confessed “film nerd”, Stolevski found it hard not to go down a self-masochistic online rabbit hole as soon as it premiered. He was in the process of editing his second feature, a queer love story set in the late 90s, and found himself stuck on a particular scene. “I was just like why can I not connect to this character in this moment and started to feel like, wait have I been shit all along and I just didn’t realise it?” he says. “The film came out and I went on Letterboxd and honestly, I’m still like 50/50. I don’t know if I might just be shit based on Letterboxd!” His confidence has grown since, he’s got used to critics microscopically analysing his work (“I don’t think it’s up to the world to be kinder, I think it’s really up to me to negotiate it,” he admits) and now has to get used to studio execs doing the same. It wasn’t intended as such but his film is a striking, can-do-anything calling card, a debut feature that feels like something made by someone much further into their career (he’s said elsewhere that the many Terrence Malick comparisons have become “triggering”). He’s understandably cautious about what’s to come. “I kind of have my team and I have my set of stories I wanna tell and I’m really wary of getting distracted by people buying you dinner and champagne,” he says. “I’ve written 13 scripts. I have three others that are just bubbling away. Most of the people who want to talk to me most of the time, they just want to talk about IP, you know like a prequel to something or I just wanna make a movie about the fire in Bambi but just from the fire’s perspective about how she was misunderstood which is not my jam.” He definitely doesn’t want to “end up in the system” and for the foreseeable future, it’s hard to see that happening. His next two films are both queer and the first of which, Of An Age, is a Melbourne-set romance between a ballroom dancer and his friend’s older brother. “Look, that one will make people cry,” he insists. “I’m very excited. It’s making everyone cry so far at least twice. And horny at least three times which is kind of a good balance.” You Won’t Be Alone is out in the US now and in the UK at a later date",Arts/Film,‘The movie directed me’: inside the year’s most haunting new film,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/01/the-movie-directed-me-inside-the-years-most-haunting-new-film
4/2/2022,"Since the first lockdown eased, many homeowners have wanted to improve their properties. The race for space has made loft conversions and extensions popular, while some of those who cannot make structural changes are considering how to remodel their homes. “Most people have been working or otherwise spending significant amounts of time at home and, probably for the first time, really getting to know why and how their existing home wasn’t working for them,” says Sam Levene, a director of the designers and architects LLI Design. “This, together with large stamp duty costs, means it can be a significantly more appetising proposition to refurbish or extend an existing home to suit your wants and needs rather than move.” Katy Esdon of Esdon Architecture in Salisbury has been busy since June 2020, when some of the Covid restrictions were first relaxed. “We had about six or seven months of being inundated,” she says. “It’s quietened down a bit but has been steady ever since.” Her clients generally want extensions and “really wow” conversions – the company has designed new kitchens and remodelled the downstairs of houses to include playrooms and working from home space. There’s “lots of glazing”, Esdon says. “People are moving away from bifolding doors and are instead looking at structural glazing, large sliding panels or Crittall-style glazing as an alternative.” However, that glazing costs considerably more than it did in 2020. According to Nick Cockayne of the Rooflight Company in Oxfordshire, since the first coronavirus lockdown, “glass has increased by 6% to 12% depending on the type, steel has increased from £950 a tonne to £1,500, MDF has shot up by 38%, and silicone, timber, stainless steel and aluminium have all increased in price”. Painful inflation is not confined to windows. According to the National Federation of Builders, material prices are changing weekly – and are on average 23.5% higher than they were last year. The cost of cement, for example, rose 1% in February, imported timber went down in price by about 20% in the same month but that followed a two-year rise of 200%. The cost of sanitary ware was up 1.9%. Water-based paint went up by 2.3%, while non-water-based paint has risen by 3.1% “It is therefore very likely that prices [will] increase mid-build, especially for new-build or extensions,” says Rico Wojtulewicz, the head of housing and planning policy at the NFB. Most companies giving estimates for home improvements will advise that prices can change – and, with the situation moving so quickly, some are making sure this is spelled out in extra-large print. Esdon says her practice is being clear with clients about the impact of inflation. “Things have got really expensive,” she says. “We’re telling people that you don’t get as much for your money as you did two or three years ago.” Her company is advising people to put by more than the traditional 10% contingency fund. It works with builders who are asked to give a fixed-price tender for the work. “This means there are no surprises,” she says. “But they are not valid for as long as they were – before, you might have had a couple of months to make a decision but now they are only valid for two or three weeks.” A written quote states the price that will be charged for the work the builder has detailed – it cannot charge you more unless you later add jobs or change the specification of the materials being used. Make sure that everything you want is included at the outset, if possible. If prices keep rising, things that you add later may come at a higher cost than you anticipate. A builder might not be willing to give a written quote for a job that will be done some months in the future or may make it clear that the quote is only valid for a certain period. Levene suggests that if you are responsible for buying anything for the build, “where at all possible, if you have out-of-the-way, clean, secure storage at your project, opt to order materials early and store them there. Or, if on-site storage is not possible, negotiate extended delivery dates with your suppliers so you can order something at today’s price but have it delivered as and when your project requires it.” Most loft conversion companies, for example, ask you to supply the sanitary ware for any bath or shower room you are having installed, so you could buy this sooner rather than later. Another option may be changing the spec of your original design – Esdon says clients are opting for cheaper cladding or different timbers to keep down costs. To add to homeowners’ woes, there are long lead times for things such as planning permission, which mean prices could rise before you get started. Permitted development rights cover many extensions and loft conversions now, so this will not be an issue for everyone. But if you live in a conservation area or are doing work not covered by the rights, you may have a long wait. According to the planning, architect and builder’s company Studio Charrette, case officers at some local authorities are struggling to get through a backlog. “As a result, the timeframe for consumers to get started on their projects, if they have applied to the council for permission, is in excess of three months,” it warns. The good news is that despite recent increases to the Bank of England base rate, borrowing through personal loans and remortgaging remains historically cheap. Personal loans of up to £50,000 are available and can be arranged over a term of one to eight years, says Andrew Hagger, a finance expert at the website MoneyComms. “If you’re looking to borrow £20,000 over five years, for example, you can still get rates as low as 2.8% APR with a monthly repayment of £357 – however, you’d need a pristine credit record if you want to bag those best-buy rates,” he says. Larger loans cost more. Hagger says borrowing £35,000 over seven years starts from about 6.7% APR, which means monthly repayments of about £520. Those rates are fixed, so you do not have to worry about repayments increasing in future months. “It’s usually easier and quicker to borrow from your own bank as it should have all your financial details and track record to hand; however, don’t let that stop you from shopping around – the biggest banks aren’t always the cheapest,” he adds. Some big banks will give you an instant decision and put the money in your account the next day. A personal loan will be easier to arrange than a mortgage, typically. But on larger amounts the rate will be lower, and you can spread the repayments over a longer term. Credit cards can be a smart way to pay for home improvements, especially if you’re looking for a smaller sum, Hagger says. There are still cards offering up to two years’ interest-free borrowing on purchases, from brands such as Barclaycard, Sainsbury’s Bank, Tesco and MBNA. “It’s always worthwhile putting an element on your credit card, as this gives you the added section 75 protection should you hit a snag with your builder and the improvements don’t come up to scratch,” Hagger says. Yes, if you like where you live and want your home to suit your needs. During the stamp duty holiday, when you could save up to £15,000 in tax, moving became more appealing to those who wanted extra space. Now that money will go some way towards buying you a basic loft conversion, with no dormer, and you will save the cost and hassle of a move. Not necessarily, if you are hoping to recoup the costs when you move. Jonathan Rolande of the National Association of Property Buyers says that when it comes to return on investment, “loft extensions need to add a required benefit to give a return on the very high cost. If a house already has five bedrooms, will a sixth add very much? Not usually.” He adds: “Double glazing won’t add a huge amount – buyers expect a home to have working windows. Kitchens and bathrooms that give a wow factor will help the property sell faster and for more.” The cost of your project will vary depending on where you live, the size of your home and the scale of the building work, and your choice of fixtures and fittings.

4/2/2022,"Children between the ages of five and 11 in England will be able to book their first coronavirus vaccine from Saturday morning, NHS England has said. Parents and carers are able to book appointments for Monday onwards through the NHS vaccines website, or by calling 119 from 7am, on Saturday morning – with hundreds of sites offering the vaccine across England. About 5 million children in England are eligible for the jab. Most of these new appointments will be at local vaccination centres across the country, or community pharmacies outside schools. There will also be walk-in clinics available, for which the NHS website will display timings. Children will be offered two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, to be administered at least 12 weeks apart. The vaccines will be a third of the strength of those administered to adults. NHS England added that more appointments will be added throughout the week, so anybody unable to get a convenient slot should keep trying. Families will be given a vaccination record card with the name of the vaccine, batch number and the date the vaccine was given. Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and deputy lead for the NHS Covid-19 vaccination programme, said: “From today, parents of almost 5 million five-to-11-year-olds can book their little ones in for a vaccine, ensuring they get their first dose of protection and helping to protect against potential future waves of Covid-19. “Vaccines remain the best defence we have against the virus – my 13-year-old son has had his two vaccinations and I’ll be booking my 10-year-old daughter in for hers at the earliest opportunity, and would encourage all parents to read the NHS information available and consider doing the same.” The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: “From Monday, the NHS will be rolling out the non-urgent offer for Covid vaccines for all children aged five to 11 in England. Parents, if they want, can take up the offer for their children to increase protection against Covid as we learn to live with this virus. “Children without underlying health conditions are at low risk of serious illness from Covid and the priority remains for the NHS to offer vaccines and spring boosters to adults and vulnerable young people, as well as to catch up with other childhood immunisation programmes.”",News/World news,Covid vaccine slots open for children aged five to 11 in England,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/covid-vaccine-chilldren-england-appointments
4/2/2022,"Boris Johnson wants his promised energy security strategy to “bet big” on nuclear despite Rishi Sunak’s reservations – but he has cooled on more onshore wind turbines in England amid a Conservative backlash. The prime minister is determined to press ahead with plans to build up to eight new nuclear power stations even though the chancellor has concerns about the cost, projected to reach more than £13bn. It is understood the energy strategy, expected to be announced next week, is likely to contain targets for nuclear but will not put a figure on the cost. Johnson will also commit to a “stretching” target on offshore wind, according to a Whitehall source. But he is now said to be less enthusiastic about the possibilities of onshore wind in England, believing Scotland offers a better landscape for new turbines. One ally of the prime minister said he would “not really [be] pushing for onshore wind in England” although it would “be in the strategy as an option where people want it, which realistically means in Scotland”. Johnson and Sunak are understood to have discussed the new strategy this week, which was commissioned to ensure security of supply amid soaring gas prices fuelled by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The document was delayed owing to a row over the scale of its ambitions on nuclear, but is now likely to be published at the end of next week. Sunak will be in London for the launch of the strategy. However, he is reported to be going on holiday in California, where he has a second home, at some point over parliamentary recess, despite rising pressure over the lack of measures to help with the cost of living and energy bills in the spring statement. The Treasury is understood to have concerns about expanding nuclear power in the UK, with the cost of new plants due to be loaded on to people’s energy bills under the fresh funding system. The government would also be likely to take minority stakes in new projects, and has set aside an estimated £1.7bn on getting one plant, Sizewell C, in a position to go ahead. But with a renewed focus on weaning the UK off gas, Johnson is insistent on the need to press ahead with new plants, with a draft target of around 16GW of nuclear power in the medium term and closer to 30GW in the longer term. According to the government’s own impact assessment, it takes on average 13 to 17 years from initial investment to electricity being generated by a new nuclear plant. On onshore wind, allies of No 10 had described Johnson as “open-minded”, but “passionate about offshore”. He appears to have cooled on the prospect of more onshore wind, as well as the potential for fracking in England, because Tory MPs are resisting developments in their constituencies. The idea of giving communities discounts on their energy bills if they accept onshore developments in their areas has been mooted, meaning the prospect of new developments is “not impossible”, but still difficult, sources said. However, Johnson has been giving out mixed messages on onshore wind after telling a group of industry leaders this week that he was “horrified” how long the planning process takes. He was told that a wind turbine can be put up in a day, but planning permission can take a decade. Officials expect No 10 will approve an energy bill to set targets and strategy for energy security, to be announced in the Queen’s speech in May. The UK has struggled to build new nuclear power stations in recent decades, with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi in 2020 pulling out of plans to build a new reactor at Wylfa, north Wales, and a move against allowing Chinese investment in Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast.",News/Politics,Johnson to ‘bet big’ on nuclear energy despite Sunak’s reservations,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/johnson-to-bet-big-on-nuclear-energy-despite-sunaks-reservations
4/2/2022,"The way he told it, Madison Cawthorn was set to go to the prestigious US Naval Academy before a car crash left him partially paralysed. According to Cawthorn, he had also been accepted into Harvard and Princeton, and worked full-time for a congressman, before being elected to the House of Representatives. Like Cawthorn’s repeated allegations of election fraud, none of those things were wholly true. Yet that hasn’t stopped the North Carolinian, who at 26 is the youngest member of Congress, from becoming one of the fastest-rising stars in the Republican party. The pro-Trump Republican was among speakers at the Save America rally which prefaced the violent insurrection at the US Capitol. His combination of fiery if often inaccurate political rhetoric and big-chinned, all-American looks have wooed Maga Republicans and inflamed Democrats in equal measure. In the past couple of weeks, however, Cawthorn has found himself condemned ​​by some on his own side. First, he verbally attacked Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president who has been widely praised for his response to Russia’s military onslaught. “Remember that Zelenskiy is a thug,” Cawthorn told an audience in a video obtained by WRAL News. “Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt and is incredibly evil and has been pushing woke ideologies.” The response was swift. For Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican, it was “not a defensible comment”. Kevin McCarthy, the Republican House minority leader, declared: “Madison is wrong.” The furore forced a spokesperson for Cawthorn to claim the congressman was “expressing his displeasure” at how Zelenskiy had “used false propaganda”. The spokesman added: “[Cawthorn] supports Ukraine and the Ukrainian president’s efforts to defend their country against Russian aggression, but does not want America drawn into another conflict through emotional manipulation.” Cawthorn has also courted trouble by telling a podcast he had been invited to orgies in Washington and had seen senior figures using cocaine. Amid complaints from Republicans in Congress, McCarthy and the party whip, Steve Scalise, gave Cawthorn a dressing down – but did not immediately take disciplinary action. With such bombastic remarks and seemingly unquenchable thirst for media coverage, Cawthorn appears to be building himself in Donald Trump’s image. And in some ways, his career to date mirrors that of the twice-impeached former president. Both have been accused of misrepresenting their ties to the military. Both have been accused of sexual misconduct by multiple women. Both continue to lie about election fraud. They also share a passion for the spotlight and a generally tenuous relationship with the truth. “He planned on serving his country in the navy, with a nomination to the US Naval Academy in Annapolis,” boomed a Cawthorn advert during his 2020 primary. “But all that changed when tragedy struck.” The tragedy was the car crash that paralyzed Cawthorn. But in fact, Cawthorn had been rejected from the Naval Academy before then, as revealed by AVL Watchdog. Cawthorn was elected anyway. On 6 January 2021, he appeared at the pro-Trump rally near the White House which preceded the Capitol attack. He told the crowd: “The Democrats, with all the fraud they have done in this election, the Republicans hiding and not fighting, they are trying to silence your voice.” Cawthorn was raised in the tiny city of Hendersonville, in the mountainous south-west of North Carolina. He was homeschooled and played football but when he was 18 a car his friend was driving crashed into a concrete barrier. Cawthorn has used a wheelchair since. Before entering Congress, he had little work experience. He had worked at Chick-fil-A and part-time – though he has claimed he was a full-time staffer – for a congressman, Mark Meadows, earning $15,000 in 2015 and $3,000 the next year, according to the Washington Post. Cawthorn would succeed Meadows in North Carolina’s 11th district – after Meadows resigned to become Trump’s chief of staff. It was while at Patrick Henry College that Cawthorn allegedly sexually harassed fellow students. In October 2020, a month before his election, more than 150 women signed an open letter accusing Cawthorn of “predatory behaviour”. “His modus operandi was to invite unsuspecting women on ‘joy rides’ in his white Dodge Challenger,” the letter said. “Cawthorn would take young women to secluded areas, lock the doors, and proceed to make unwanted sexual advances. It became a regular warning in the female dorms not to be caught alone with Madison Cawthorn.” In February 2021, BuzzFeed News spoke to more than three dozen people who described instances of sexual harassment or misconduct by Cawthorn. “Looking back now in hindsight, I would have changed how I acted,” Cawthorn told Time. Cawthorn dropped out of Patrick Henry College after one semester, according to the Ashville Citizen-Times, after accumulating “mostly D grades”, which he attributed to continuing pain and a brain injury from the car crash. But if the voters of the 11th district were aware of such accusations, they didn’t seem concerned. Cawthorn won a runoff in the Republican primary and then took the congressional seat, even if his share of the vote, 54.5%, was lower than Meadows achieved in his four terms in office. Cawthorn’s bid was aided by $500,000 from an out-of-state Super Pac, days before the vote. Since entering office, Cawthorn has often been lumped in with hard-right Trumpists like Lauren Boebert, from Colorado, and Marjorie Taylor Greene, from Georgia. But some of his oeuvre is more reminiscent of traditional politicians. “His voting record is not on the right side of the Republican party,” said Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University and a close watcher of Cawthorn’s 13th district. “He’s rhetorically extreme, but his voting behavior doesn’t look out of the ordinary at all. So is he ultra-conservative? No. Is he rhetorically extreme? Absolutely.” Still, that hasn’t stopped Cawthorn from jumping on rightwing hobby horse issues like the alleged liberal ideology being forced on school students and Joe Biden’s mental acuity. Cawthorn has also continued to claim the 2020 presidential election was “stolen” and “rigged”. Last August, he told a crowd: “If our election systems continue to be rigged and continue to be stolen then it’s going to lead to one place and that’s bloodshed.” All that has brought immense media attention. But Cawthorn could now be in trouble, due to a mess of his own making. In 2021, he said he would run for a different district – only to do an about turn and file for re-election in the 11th district. A raft of Republican challengers have jumped into the race, however, and they are not going away. On Veterans Day last year, Cawthorn announced that he would seek election in the newly rejigged, Republican-friendly 13th congressional district, hundreds of miles from his Hendersonville home. The shift would have brought Cawthorn from the relative obscurity of the far-west of the state to a more densely populated area. “It would have given him a bigger footprint statewide. It would have brought him into the Charlotte media market,” Cooper said. But at the start of February, the North Carolina supreme court ordered that the state’s district map be changed, placing more Democratic voters in the 13th district, rendering it a much less certain Republican victory. Cawthorn turned tail, and filed paperwork to run in the 11th district. If that upsets some voters, Cooper said Cawthorn does have a flair for bringing in cash. “I’ve never seen a politician so adept at fundraising,” Cooper said. “Although he is perhaps even more adept at spending.” Some of those expenditures have raised eyebrows. One of Cawthorn’s most unusual receipts in 2021 was $1,700 to a taxidermist – apparently to create “gifts to be given out to fundraising hosts”. According to OpenSecrets, $2.6m of the $2.8m Cawthorn raised through the end of 2021 has been spent, $1,405,918 on more fundraising. Other receipts were filed for trips to California and Florida, excursions which wouldn’t appear to have much to do with the prosperity of the 11th congressional district of North Carolina. As well as facing credible challengers in his own party, Cawthorn has drawn attention from Democrats. A group called Fire Madison Cawthorn has urged North Carolina Democrats to change party affiliation so they can vote in the Republican primary for Wendy Nevarez, a less rightwing candidate. “Madison Cawthorn is a clear and present danger to our nation whose re-election must be fought every step of the way,” wrote David Wheeler, president of the American Muckrakers Pac, which is funding the effort. It remains to be seen how much impact such efforts will have, but it is clear there is some dissatisfaction with Cawthorn. In the wake of his “thug” comment about Zelenskiy, two of North Carolina’s most influential newspapers criticized Cawthorn. The Winston-Salem Journal was particularly vigorous. “​​Of all the many, many, many reasons we could find to legitimately criticise North Carolina’s gift to Crazytown, Rep Madison Cawthorn … it’s perhaps his latest exploit that has us truly seeing red,” an op-ed said. In his own district, Cawthorn has been savaged by columnists in the Ashville Citizen-Times. “What we’ve learned about Cawthorn since his election in 2020 is this: he cares about Madison Cawthorn,” John Boyle wrote on 12 March. “He’s a juvenile, ill-informed, belligerent man who spews untrue conspiracy theories, encourages mothers to raise ‘monsters’, inspired the January 6 rioters on to their insurrection and barely bothers to pretend to represent his district.”",News/US news,Madison Cawthorn: the Republican building himself in Trump’s image,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/02/madison-cawthorn-profile-republican-trump-north-carolina
4/2/2022,"The phone call came five days after the Watergate break-in. Martha Mitchell began telling a reporter that she would leave her husband, former US attorney general John Mitchell, if he did not quit the “dirty business” of politics. But the conversation ended abruptly and Mitchell was heard shouting: “You just get away – get away!” Then the line went dead. She had been accosted by a former FBI agent and would be forcibly tranquilized and held captive for days. Mitchell would also see her reputation destroyed by loyalists to the then president, Richard Nixon, because of what she knew about Watergate – dooming her to become one of the hidden figures of the biggest political scandal of the 20th century. That is now about to change. The 1970s celebrity socialite will next month be played by the Hollywood actor Julia Roberts in Gaslit, an eight-part TV drama co-starring Sean Penn as John Mitchell and Dan Stevens as the White House counsel, John Dean. The series on America’s Starz network – riding a wave of books, exhibitions and films marking the 50th anniversary of the break‐in and burglary of the Democratic national headquarters at the Watergate complex – illuminates the mostly forgotten role of a woman who paid a tragic price for trying to raise the alarm about Nixon’s skulduggery. “She was kidnapped, sedated, drugged,” said Kate Clarke Lemay, a historian at Washington’s Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, which features a Time magazine cover image of Mitchell in its Watergate: Portraiture and Intrigue exhibition. “People denied that this happened to her. In today’s phrase, they gaslit her, they called her crazy, they used that age-old reference for women as hysterical … She was the whistleblower and we respect her today.” Mitchell was a garrulous bon vivant on the Washington social scene with a penchant for drinking whisky and calling journalists late at night. Born in Arkansas, she earned the nickname “the Mouth of the South”, while the New York Times once called her “the most talked about, talkative woman in Washington”. Garrett Graff, author of the recently published Watergate: A New History, said: “Martha Mitchell is one of the most significant figures of the Watergate age and has been largely lost to history for most of the intervening 50 years. She was in many ways the first conservative political pundit, the forerunner of outspoken voices like Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin. “During the Nixon administration, she was the second most in-demand figure for Republican events after the president himself and was this larger-than-life, colourful, outspoken woman in Washington at a time when most cabinet wives were seen, not heard.” Mitchell came to know key details about Watergate largely from eavesdropping on her husband’s phone calls and meetings and looking through his papers. John Mitchell, Nixon’s most trusted adviser and former attorney general, had taken charge of the Committee for the Re-election of the President (CRP) and authorized the Watergate break-in on 17 June 1972. After the burglars were caught red-handed, Martha Mitchell was astonished to learn that the CRP’s security director, James McCord, a former CIA officer who had worked as her personal security guard, was among those arrested. From a hotel in California she phoned Helen Thomas, a journalist at United Press International, to discuss what she knew. But the conversation was cut short when an ex-FBI agent, Steve King, instructed by John Mitchell to keep his wife away from the media, yanked the phone out of the wall. Thomas tried to call back but was told by the switchboard operator that Mitchell was “indisposed and could not talk”. Thomas then tried John Mitchell, who casually dismissed the incident, saying of his wife: “That little sweetheart, I love her so much. She gets a little upset about politics, but she loves me and I love her and that’s what counts.” Martha Mitchell later accused King of assaulting, kidnapping and sedating her. During their struggle, her hand smashed a window and required stitches. Five men held her down on a bed while a doctor injected her with a tranquilliser. In 1975 McCord admitted “basically the woman was kidnapped”. When Mitchell returned to Washington, she told Thomas: “I’m black and blue. They don’t want me to talk.” But the media paid relatively little attention and Nixon loyalists, desperate to conceal the White House’s role in the break-in, set about discrediting her as a say-anything alcoholic and therefore unreliable witness. Graff said: “Polite Washington shrugged and saw her as this figure worthy of ridicule, not sympathy, and so she was not taken seriously in either her allegations about her own treatment or about her warnings about the behavior of the Nixon administration writ large and the Nixon campaign specifically.” “Her husband basically told everyone that she was mentally unwell and an alcoholic and not to put too much stock in her. She was one of the first voices to try to warn the country about the corruption at the centre of the Nixon administration and was really laughed at.” Mitchell’s candor made her popular with reporters before Watergate. Sally Quinn, an author and journalist, talked to her many times. She recalled: “She said exactly what she thought all the time and was very clever and very witty and very smart. “She realized right away the crowd she was traveling in and she didn’t like it. She put up with it for a while and then she just kind of thought, ‘I can’t do this any more’, and she started speaking out. “They had to figure out a way to deal with her so what they did was they said she was crazy. She wasn’t crazy. It turns out because she was right: they locked her in a room, they kidnapped her. When they did what they did to her, you realize she really wasn’t crazy at all.” John Mitchell resigned from the CRP soon after the break-in and it transpired that he had controlled a political slush fund used for gathering intelligence on Democrats. He eventually served 19 months in a federal prison for his part in the cover-up – the first former attorney general to be convicted of a crime. Without saying goodbye, he had walked out on Mitchell in 1973 and they never spoke again. According to a biography of her by Winzola McLendon, she took his portrait from the wall and “with turpentine and such kitchen supplies as SOS pads, Ajax, Clorox, mayonnaise and Heinz catsup, Martha erased John Mitchell’s face from the canvas”. Martha Mitchell called for Nixon’s resignation as early as May 1973; the president was eventually forced to step down in August 1974. Nixon later told interviewer David Frost: “I’m convinced if it hadn’t been for Martha – and God rest her soul, because she in her heart was a good person. She just had a mental and emotional problem that nobody knew about. If it hadn’t been for Martha, there’d have been no Watergate.” Mitchell died of bone marrow cancer in 1976 at the age of 57. Quinn commented: “She’s an absolute tragedy. One of the Washington people who end up being just ground up and spat out, and she had a tragic ending. She wasn’t crazy. She was brave. She called it like she saw it and and she paid for it.” Half a century on, Watergate lore is dominated by men such as Nixon, John Mitchell, journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, and FBI whistleblower Mark Felt, known as “Deep Throat”. Notably the film All the President’s Men features the Washington Post editor, Ben Bradlee, but not the publisher, Katharine Graham (an oversight corrected by Steven Spielberg’s The Post). But efforts to rescue Mitchell’s reputation have been growing in recent years. She featured in Slate’s Slow Burn podcast on Watergate – the first episode, Martha, told “the story of a woman who knew too much” – and is the subject of a new short documentary film on Netflix entitled The Martha Mitchell Effect. Patton Oswalt, an actor and comedian who plays the Nixon hatchet man Charles Colson in Gaslit, said: “The Watergate scandal was always looked at as oh, it was a huge challenge to democracy and to America but it was taken down and defended by noble journalists, and certainly Woodward and Bernstein did their job and Deep Throat certainly acted his conscience. “But the fact that a major part of it was just a very troubled marriage by a fascinatingly complex woman – history always becomes richer as you go further and further down the line, newer and newer details about what actually went down. This is just an aspect of that.”",News/US news,‘They called her crazy’: Watergate whistleblower finally gets her due,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/02/watergate-martha-mitchell-whistleblower-gaslit
4/2/2022,"Sue Gray is being kept in the dark about which Downing Street parties have attracted fines, as officials began to receive £50 penalties for attending illegal lockdown gatherings, following the Metropolitan police investigation. Emails were received by some partygoers this week, after the police said they were issuing 20 penalty notices to those they had a “reasonable belief” attended gatherings during lockdown. However, the Met is refusing to reveal which parties have attracted fines. It is understood that Gray, the senior civil servant carrying out the inquiry into suspected Downing Street parties during lockdown, is also not being informed which events have reached the bar of criminality. She is due to update and publish her report when the police investigation is complete, but is not expecting to receive full information on which of 12 parties under investigation and which officials, aides and potentially politicians have been fined. The Cabinet Office and No 10 are also unaware which, if any, of its current employees have been issued with penalties. No 10 has committed to disclosing whether Boris Johnson and Simon Case, the cabinet secretary, have received fines, but otherwise officials are not being encouraged to go public or even tell their line managers if they are handed penalties. Their names are only likely to become public if any of the own up to having been present, or they decide to challenge the fine, which could see their name listed by the relevant magistrates court. Labour has criticised the lack of transparency, with Keir Starmer saying on Thursday that the public must be told if the prime minister’s wife, Carrie Johnson, received a fixed-penalty notice for breaking lockdown rules. Government sources said the Met appeared to have tackled the “low-hanging fruit first” by concentrating on parties where those involved had acknowledged their participation. The Met suggested the fines were issued as part of a “first tranche”, indicating that more could be handed out in relation to more complicated events where those involved were denying having attended illegal gatherings. One of the events where some of the people in attendance are believed to have got fines is a leaving party on 18 June, which was held for a departing No 10 aide. The prime minister is believed to have been present at several of the gatherings under investigation, including a birthday party and a gathering in the garden of No 10 organised by his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds. However, he has refused to accept that a fine would mean he has broken the law, and his allies suggested he would not resign if he were issued with a penalty. He repeatedly dodged questions on the issue when he appeared at the Commons liaison committee on Wednesday. In contrast, Kit Malthouse, the policing minister, appeared to back the view of two cabinet colleagues – Dominic Raab and Anne-Marie Trevelyan – that the issuing of Partygate fines evidence that police believe the law had been broken. Malthouse, a Home Office minister, said it was fair to say a fixed-penalty notice (FPN) signalled police felt an unlawful act had been committed. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Malthouse said: “A fixed-penalty notice means police have a reasonable belief that you’ve broken the law – you still have a right to challenge it if you want. “Having said that, the police practice is not routinely to release the names of those who receive fixed penalties, and I don’t see why that rule should be waived for those people who may or may not be in receipt of it in Downing Street.” Malthouse, who attends cabinet, said he had not personally received a fine in relation to the Scotland Yard investigation, but he would declare it if he did. The threat by some Tory MPs to depose Johnson as leader has lessened in recent weeks amid the crisis in Ukraine, but confirmation of the first penalties on Tuesday reignited talk of a possible challenge and speculation over his future if he were issued with a fine and criticised in the Gray report.",News/Politics,Partygate: Sue Gray kept in dark as first fines issued to No 10 officials,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/02/partygate-sue-gray-fines-downing-street-boris-johnson-no-10
