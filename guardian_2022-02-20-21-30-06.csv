2/20/2022,"Today in a nutshell: A gold at last for Britain, an historic ice hockey victory for Finland, and yet another win for Norway Next up: The closing ceremony signals a pause before Beijing hosts the Winter Paralympics starting 4 March  Eve Muirhead, Vicky Wright, Jen Dodds, and Hailey Duff will be the only members of Team GB to return from Beijing with a gold medal after they triumphed on the last day in a somewhat one-sided women’s curling final, beating Japan 10-3. Team GB ended the Beijing Games with two medals – short of their target of three to seven – after Bruce Mouat’s men won curling silver on Saturday. Curling coach David Murdoch described it as “a perfect performance” from Muirhead and her team. There were, as they say, absolute scenes, as Finland came from behind and defeated the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) 2-1 in the men’s ice hockey final to take an Olympic title for the very first time. They’ve been losing finalists twice (in 2006 and in 1988) and won four bronze medals through the years, but never won gold. The Finns ended up unbeaten throughout the tournament, including that blockbuster three-goal comeback against Sweden to top their group. “This means a lot, first time we made history today, it feels great,” said Finnish forward Markus Granlund. “It was an early game, the fans probably woke up early, it’s a big thing for Finland.” Germany extended their historic sliding dominance at the Beijing Games. Yesterday there was a one-two finish in the women’s bobsleigh with Laura Nolte holding off defending Olympic champion and countrywoman Mariama Jamanka. Then in the final action in the sliding centre, Francseco Friedrich and Johannes Lochner piloted their respective four-man teams to another German one-two. “We hope it goes on,” Friedrich said after the race. “Our goal is to make four more years.” For his part, Lochner said of Friedrich, “There’s always a chance to beat him, but the point is that he has to do a mistake.” There was almost a symmetry to the Games as one of the very last medals to be won went to the athlete who had won the very first medal just over a fortnight ago – Norway’s Therese Johaug. She won the women’s mass start cross-country 30km. The race was moved earlier due to expected high winds. Norway ended up with 16 golds, a new record for a single country at a single Games. Jessie Diggins of the US came second, and was so cold and exhausted that she had to be assisted away from the finish line. Finland’s Remi Lindholm underlined just how cold and tough the conditions were during the men’s shortened 30km mass start event on Saturday by revealing that his penis froze during the race. He explained that he used a heat pack to try to thaw it once the race was over. “When the body parts started to warm up after the finish, the pain was unbearable,” he added. Ouch. The doping row about the figure skating medals continues, but at least one contentious issue from these Games has gone away. South Korea’s Olympic Committee has said it has dropped plans to have a right old moan up to the Court of Arbitration for Sport about their speed skaters Hwang Dae-heon and Lee June-seo being disqualified from the men’s 1000m semi-finals on 7 February. Thrills, spills and Olympic figure skating dreams – in pictures ‘Perfect performance’: Team GB finally win first Beijing gold in women’s curling Mikaela Shiffrin’s Olympics end with no medal after mixed team near-miss Austria took the honours in the mixed team parallel contest that was rescheduled to the final day. The Austrian team beat Germany in the final, while Mikaela Shiffrin will leave the Beijing Olympics without a medal after the US lost to Norway in the third-place race.

2/20/2022,"Victims of alleged sexual abuse by a French modelling agent have expressed shock and dismay after he was found dead in his cell, in an apparent echo of the prison suicide of his close associate, the disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein. Paris police are investigating the death of Jean-Luc Brunel, 75, who had been charged with the rape of minors and was also being held on suspicion of trafficking underage girls for sex, whose body was found in La Santé prison early on Saturday.  Sources close to the investigation said Brunel had hanged himself, but this has not been officially confirmed. Epstein was found hanged in his New York jail cell in August 2019 while awaiting trial over the alleged abuse of hundreds of young girls. Brunel’s death means the case against the agent – who was arrested in December 2020 at Charles de Gaulle airport as part of a French probe launched after US sex-trafficking charges were brought against Epstein – is now closed unless other suspects are identified. A frequent companion of Epstein, who travelled often to France and had apartments in Paris, Brunel was accused in US court documents of rape and of procuring young girls for his friend and was considered central to the French investigation. Victims of his alleged trafficking, who were mostly said to have been lured with promises of lucrative modelling contracts, said they were angry that Brunel, like Epstein, would never face trial. Anne-Claire Le Jeune, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, described the news as “quite terrible” for them, adding they felt Brunel had “left behind many secrets”. Le Jeune expressed the women’s “frustration and bitterness over not being able to obtain justice – just as for the victims of Epstein”, adding that it had taken “so much courage for them to be able to speak up, to be heard by the police”. Thysia Huisman, a Dutch former model who has said she was drugged and raped by Brunel as a teenager and was one of many women to identify themselves to French police as victims of the agent’s abuse, said she was shocked by the news of his death. “It makes me angry, because I’ve been fighting for years,” Huisman said. “For me, the end of this was to be in court. And now that whole ending – which would help form closure – is taken away from me. To rebuild yourself, that is an essential step.” One of Epstein’s principal accusers, Virginia Giuffre, who has said the financier once bragged to her that he had slept with more than 1,000 “of Brunel’s girls”, said she was disappointed by the news of the agent’s death. “The suicide of Jean-Luc Brunel, who abused me and countless girls and young women, ends another chapter,” Giuffre tweeted. “I’m disappointed that I wasn’t able to face him in a final trial to hold him accountable, but gratified that I was able to testify in person last year to keep him in prison.” Giuffre recently accepted an undisclosed sum from Prince Andrew after bringing a civil case against the Queen’s second son, with whom she says she had sex when she was 17 – a minor under US law – after being introduced to him through Epstein. Sigrid McCawley, Giuffre’s lawyer, said the news of Brunel’s death was “devastating”. “For the women who have stood up … it is not how these men died, but how they lived, and the damage they caused to so many. The fight to seek truth and justice goes on,” she said. Brunel’s lawyers said his apparent suicide was “not guided by guilt, but a profound sense of injustice”. Mathias Chichportich, Marianne Abgrall and Christophe Ingrain said his death was “the tragedy of a 75-year-old man crushed by a media-judicial system. He had always maintained his innocence and had intensified his efforts to prove it.” Brunel began his career as a model scout and in 1978 was involved in setting up the prestigious Karin Models agency. He then moved to the US where he co-founded the Miami-based agency MC2. He is credited with discovering a number of supermodels, including Christy Turlington and Milla Jovovich. He had been placed under formal investigation for the alleged rape of two minors and for sexual harassment, and also been questioned on suspicion of sex trafficking of underage girls. He denied all charges.",News/US news,Alleged sexual abuse victims ‘angry’ over death of Epstein friend,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/20/alleged-sexual-abuse-victims-angry-over-death-of-jeffrey-epstein-friend-jean-luc-brunel
2/20/2022,"When Tom Pooley, 21, became the first person to receive an experimental vaccine against plague as part of a medical trial last summer after tests on mice, he was inspired by the thought that his involvement could help to rid the world of one of the most brutal killers in human history. “They made it quite clear I was the first human to receive it,” says Pooley, a radiotherapy engineering student. “They didn’t dress it up, but they made it clear it was as safe as possible. There are risks, but they are talented people: it’s a big honour to be the first.” The single-shot, based on the Chadox technology developed by the Oxford Vaccine Group and AstraZeneca, took less than five seconds to painlessly administer, he says. That night, he felt a little unwell, but he was fine within three hours; and the small trial continued apace to combat the centuries-old bacteria threat, which killed 171 in Madagascar as recently as 2017. It uses a weakened, genetically altered version of a common-cold virus from chimpanzees.  It is just one example of how scientists are increasingly looking at how Covid treatments can help to treat other diseases. Trials are expected to be developed for other similar jabs against dengue, Zika and a whole host of pathogens. Another vaccine study against Ebola is already going to human trials. As Professor Sarah Gilbert, architect of the Oxford Vaccine, has said: “We’ve got the cake and we can put a cherry on top, or we can put some pistachios on top if we want a different vaccine, we just add the last bit and then we’re ready to go.” The Covid pandemic sparked an unprecedented drive to control a lethal disease whose outbreak led to a near global shutdown to contain its spread. Billions in public and private money were pumped into research like never before in such a short space of time. It’s not something the medical world would have chosen, but the developments of the past two years could not have happened without Covid-19 – the pathogen has served as a giant catalyst ushering in different technologies, data and research that offer insights into other diseases. The lessons that have been learned – and the new norms that have solidified – will change medical science forever. The world now sits on the verge of a number of potentially significant breakthroughs, mostly thanks to the growing research into hi-tech vaccines, which could benefit patients with cancer and a whole raft of infectious diseases. Meanwhile, new studies into long Covid could shine a light into blood clotting, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and other conditions associated with the stubborn virus. Obesity and vitamin levels are under the microscope; while digitisation and increased cross-border collaboration could soon reap rewards. “Covid has stimulated the rapid translation of previous knowledge into practice,” says Independent Sage member and UCL professor of virology, Deenan Pillay. “Developing science takes many years and needs an opportunity to be implemented. Covid has provided an easier regulatory environment, with fast-tracked trials, so vaccine developments, for example, have been really quick.” Until Covid it could take a decade or more for a new vaccine or drug to go through all the development and regulatory stages, he adds, but now they have been rolled out within 12 months of first description of the disease. “Our expectations are now for a much more rapid translation and implementation of scientific advances,” says Pillay. “The caveat to this is the continuing need for equity of access to these advances, which is yet to be seen with Covid vaccines and drugs.” Just five years ago, there was widespread hesitation to invest in experimental drugs that use synthetic molecules to guide human cells into making specific proteins that can defend against diseases. No product based on mRNA (which stands for messenger ribonucleic acid, and provides recipes to create proteins) technology had ever been approved, but within two years, the rapid development and success of Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s jabs against Covid were a gamechanger. The US big pharma giant Pfizer was already working with German start-up BioNTech, which has significant mRNA expertise, on a flu jab before the emergence of Covid. Then focus shifted to developing a vaccine for the pandemic and the pressing need for a treatment to be created accelerated steps into the next frontier – research into treatments based on RNA, a strand of DNA that transfers the instructions needed to make proteins. “It’s been an unforeseen benefit of the pandemic because RNA and mRNA vaccine technology has been researched for at least 10 years,” says Richard Bucala, the Yale school of medicine chief of rheumatology, allergy and immunology. “It wasn’t until the pandemic that RNA was really heavily invested in,” he adds. “Vaccine development is empiric: it’s very difficult to figure out if it’s going to work. It’s extremely risky. No one really wants to be involved in research and development. You don’t realise it’s a failure until you’re tens of millions into a trial. But the fortuitous success of RNA tech changed all of that.” Relative public acceptance of an unusual hi-tech approach has also been key, and approval by a diverse range of regulatory bodies has given both investors and industry confidence. This could open the floodgates to further approvals if the new jabs impress in trials that are being prepared for humans. Already they have their sights set on another killer disease, malaria, which is estimated to have killed almost half of all people since the Stone Age. It remained a leading cause of global infectious disease death last year: more than 600,000 people, usually young children, died from it. Bucala’s team, in partnership with pharmaceutical company Novartis, succeeded in developing a “self-amplifying” RNA (also known as saRNA) jab for it. The technology stems from a successful RNA malaria vaccine for mice developed at Yale and is in advanced preclinical testing. It could be tested for the first time in humans within two years. “You can potentially protect against a range of tropical diseases using self-amplifying RNA, which targets a parasite-encoded MIF protein that kills memory cells,” he says. “The self-amplification advancement will create the next generation in RNA vaccines, permitting much lower dosing and the generation of critically needed memory T-cell responses. All of this will unfold in the next five to 10 years.” Or even earlier: at the start of February, Moderna began their trial for an HIV vaccine that relies on the same mRNA technology as the Covid jab. If they’re successful, a one-off jab will offer lifetime protection. Now this technology is being studied to see if it could help control largely treatment-resistant conditions, such as rabies, Zika, and cancer of the colon, skin, breast and other parts of the body. Professor David Diemert, an immunologist at George Washington University, says: “The Covid pandemic really demonstrated the success of mRNA vaccines. And so the path from discussing its application for HIV to a Phase I clinical trial happened at an accelerated pace.” Dr Jeffrey Bethony, professor of microbiology, immunology and tropical medicine at George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences adds, “This vaccine primes the immune response against HIV by stimulating cells in the lymph node. This procedure is not just unique to Phase I trials; it’s unique for vaccines. It’s very novel.” Moderna alone is developing trials for at least another 30 mRNA-based treatments in six different areas of medicine. Meanwhile, there has been more focus on how to tackle obesity since it has emerged as a leading factor related to Covid – 78% of US patients hospitalised between March and December 2020 were overweight. In June, the first obesity medication approved by the US Food and Drugs Administration since 2014 hit the market. Semaglutide, also known as Wegovy, could be up to twice as effective as previous weight-loss medications after a study of nearly 2,000 patients saw participants lose on average 15% of their body weight. The synthetic version of a hormone that reduces appetite was already used in much lower doses to treat type 2 diabetes, but amid growing evidence that substantial weight loss reduces Covid severity, it was greenlighted by regulators. The availability of a drug that can improve both blood glucose and body weight could have far-reaching effects for public health beyond the context of Covid, especially for people who have remained overweight despite their best efforts. Covid has also shone a light on the potential benefits of vitamin D. In Norway, Finland and Iceland, where there’s an emphasis on maintaining healthy levels of the vitamin, persistently low Covid mortality rates have been observed compared to other northern-hemisphere countries with less of a focus on the sunshine nutrient. Amid the ongoing search to ascertain exactly what makes some people more vulnerable to Covid than others, focus on vitamin D earlier this year led to the publication of a paper in a Lancet journal co-authored by dozens of experts, which suggested deficiencies could be a root issue in the development of many diseases “For participants with vitamin D deficiency, genetic analyses provided strong evidence for an inverse association with all-cause mortality,” it said, calling for wider trials and a fresh look at disease prevention strategies. “There are several potential mechanisms by which vitamin D could be protective for cardiovascular mortality… There are also potential mechanisms implicating vitamin D for cancer.” Digital health has also come to the fore as a result of pandemic responses. “Use of smartphone applications and the public understanding of data and knowledge of disease prevalence are now widespread,” says Pillay. “People are increasingly accustomed to getting clinical advice at distance, through virtual consultations, while other information collected on apps is sent to medical professionals.” Home testing is also a significant advance, as it allows people to effectively self-diagnose and thus be able to limit their exposure to others. This has come alongside rapid clinical evaluation. “Covid has provided a vision for how best to apply science to health problems in the future,” he says. And as more in-depth research into long Covid is starting to emerge, it is throwing more light on other long-term conditions, such as ME/CFS. The crucial link here could be microclotting, an area Resia Pretorius, head of the physiological sciences department at Stellenbosch University, South Africa, has long been exploring, but the need for further understanding has become even more pressing due to Covid. The model under scrutiny proposes that small clots in blood capillaries preventing oxygen from reaching tissues may cause long-Covid symptoms. Pretorius is now leading a study investigating this further, to understand whether microclotting could go some way to unravelling the enigma of long Covid after research in her lab detected significant formations among patients. The preliminary results of her initial research suggested that anti-clotting treatments could help ease long Covid. “There might be a point of no return for many ME/CFS patients – this might also be the case for long Covid, if you don’t treat early in the disease onset,” says Pretorius, “then the body can become overwhelmed by inflammatory molecules that may cause significant damage. We suspect the reasons why people develop long Covid from a viral infection could be similar to why individuals develop ME/CFS.” Pretorius, among many other scientists, has been impressed by the increasing degree of academic and research collaboration – with Covid uniting people from across the globe in a common goal that could endure. “Thank goodness, there’s a lot of like-minded researchers who have joined the endeavours from a variety of big research institutions all over the world,” she says. If there’s one area of optimism, it is this move towards scientific collaboration and the impressive advances that have emerged in such a relatively short space of time. “It’s been such a horrific time for so many people”, agrees David Braun, an oncologist and scientist focusing on cancer immunotherapies at the Yale Cancer Centre in New Haven, whose team is working to transfer the RNA technology to a cancer jab. “I hope that some of the scientific advances made during this period might help us to treat other diseases, so that at least there can be one glimmer of hope that comes out of this tremendously difficult situation.”",News/World news,How Covid changed medicine for the future,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/how-covid-created-a-vision-for-treating-disease
2/20/2022,"The metaverse. You’ve heard about it. You’ve read about it. But do you really understand it? Unfortunately, most small business owners I know don’t. They should. The metaverse is virtual. But it’s also real. It’s an online world that might generate its own economy. So far it’s been mostly created and championed by Mark Zuckerberg, who literally changed the name of one of the most familiar brands in the world to match its future promise – Meta. But the big brands are jumping in … and in a big way.  Microsoft is positioning its products for better business collaboration in the metaverse. Google is building a more-user friendly and less cringe-worthy version of its failed Google Glass so that people can use a new wearable device to access the metaverse without looking like a complete fool. Other companies like Magic Leap are building similar devices. Gaming company Epic Games has raised $1bn to support their “vision” for the metaverse. Walmart has filed “several new trademarks” that apparently indicate it will be creating its own cryptocurrency and a collection of NFTs (non-fungible tokens, the unique identifiers that are being attached to digital art and products to identify them as being one of a kind and original). McDonald’s recently filed 10 trademark applications including one for a virtual restaurant that would deliver to an actual home. Samsung recently launched a new smartphone on the metaverse – although not without some problems. Even the staid and traditional accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers has purchased virtual property on Sandbox, a metaverse platform. How big is the metaverse? When you add it all up, billions have already been invested, with some analysts saying it could be a $30tn marketplace within the next 10 to 15 years. By comparison, the entire US economy in 2021 was about $25tn. For people over the age of 30 the metaverse sounds strange, foreign … and even a little sad and creepy. But for the next generation – particularly the Gen Z-types born after 1995, and the kids currently in elementary school – the metaverse will be commonplace. They’ll be used to living in both a virtual and actual world. Just like we’re used to living online. In fact, the average American spends 24 hours a week surfing the internet. The average gamer is immersed in the worlds of Halo, Minecraft and Call of Duty for close to 800 hours a year. These are all the very first virtual worlds. The metaverse will take this to the next level. Right now it’s the big brands – as always – taking the first steps. But once a path is cleared, the doors will be open for a flood of new businesses to take advantage. How? If you’re running a small business you’ll soon be ditching Zoom and Teams and meeting with a hologram or avatar of a customer, partner, supplier or employee in a virtual conference room, discussing and reviewing virtual documents and items together. If you’re a realtor, you’ll take walk-throughs of virtual renditions of homes with your customers. If you’re in construction, you’ll do the same with properties under development. Your conferences will be virtual affairs. Your sales pitches will be in virtual locations. You will have a virtual version of yourself. Don’t worry – none of this will replace actual human contact. It will complement it. It will make your interactions more pleasant and more personal as opposed to the detached online meetings we’re having right now. All of this will come with a cost. You will need to buy real estate to have your meetings. You will need to equip those rooms with art and furniture. You will need to get the tools to make your presentations. But then again a lot of smart entrepreneurs will be selling this stuff, providing the infrastructure and offering hot real estate and products that everyone will want so there will be lots of money to be made too. How will this affect your small business in 2022? It won’t. But what about in 2027? Or 2032? It will. It’s a decade since the birth of the iPad, Instagram, Lyft, Square and Slack. In 2022 Amazon’s Echo, Apple’s Watch and AirPods and 4G either didn’t or barely existed. Now they do and all have had enormous impacts on the way we run our companies. So a lot can change in a decade. A lot will change in the next decade. That change will be the metaverse. And the smartest business owners I know are keeping an eye on how to profit from it.",News/Business,Big brands are jumping into the metaverse – your small business should too | Gene Marks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/20/metaverse-profit-small-business-big-brands
2/20/2022,"It was only a matter of time before vermouth became fashionable again. It’s a half-century since its last heyday, an era when big Italian brands, Martini and Cinzano, were an essential element of a certain vision of jet-setting sophistication. That’s plenty of time for the cycle of fashion to complete its 360-degree rotation through naff and kitsch to ironic retro and sincere rediscovery. It’s not just a matter of image. Vermouth’s characteristics suit the times. If a drink that derives so much of its character from an infusion of botanicals can’t find favour now, at the end of the long gin boom, it never will.  For someone of my generation, who grew up when vermouth was something found lurking at the back of parental drinks cabinets, there’s a certain amount of cultural baggage to ditch before taking a seat at the bar of one of the stylish new, specialist bars and restaurants that have emerged over the past five years. At Kings Cross’s Vermuteria and the Aperitivo Bar of Soho’s Mele e Pere, vermouth isn’t just a background ingredient in classic cocktails such as the martini, the manhattan and the negroni. It’s served as it would be in Turin or Barcelona: neat, over ice, with a slice of citrus – an aperitivo to be consumed with a bowl of olives. Drinking it this way, it doesn’t take long to realise that vermouth can be every bit as complex as good sherry, port or, indeed, unfortified wine, even though the skills required for making it are a little different. Made from a base of fortified wine, choosing and infusing the range of bitters, citrus peels, herbs and spices that give each vermouth its own distinctive character, calls for something closer to the art of the chef or perfumer. Mauro Vergano, the Piedmontese man behind some of the finest, most uplifting vermouths has perhaps the perfect experience for the job: after training in oenology, he spent 15 years working as a chemist developing flavours and aromas for a pharmaceutical company. Vergano, who began making his infusions as a hobby, is part of a wave of small-batch vermouth producers, many of them producing vermouth as a sideline from wine, others from the spirits and bartending worlds, that has emerged over the past decade in the drink’s traditional heartland in northern Italy and in France, but also in Spain, the US, South Africa and, increasingly, the UK. With their fastidious attention to the quality of both wine and botanicals these crafty newcomers have brought a new, sometimes-quirky, polished dimension to a venerable drink. But for me there’s at least as much pleasure in exploring the library of older brands you find at Mele e Pere. Among them is the original Turin vermouth, Antica Formula Carpano Vermouth. First produced in 1786, the modern-day version still uses the same recipe. Its intensely medicinal bitter-sweetness – a blend of Alpine herbs and spices including saffron – will never go out of style. Gonzalez Byass Vermouth La Copa RojoSpain (from £12.95, thewhiskyexchange.com; cambridgewine.com; farehamwinecellar.com)Spain has been at the forefront of the 21st-century vermouth revival and it has its own long tradition of producing aromatised wines. Many of the best examples in both eras are the work of Jerez’s sherry bodegas, with La Copa by González Byass (of Tío Pepe fame) a sweet, heady, red revival of a 19th-century classic. Dolin Dry Vermouth de ChamberyFrance (£14.95, thewhiskyexchange.com)Vermouth’s origins may be on the Italian side of the Alps, but French versions of the drink had become enormously popular by the mid-19th century. Originally patented in 1820, Dolin’s original white mix of 30 Alpine botanicals remains as fragrant and citrus fresh as ever. AA Badenhorst Caperitif Kaapse DiefSouth Africa (£20, swig.co.uk)One of the key winemakers to emerge from the creative ferment of South Africa’s Swartland region, Adi Badenhorst has proved no less adept at making this Cape version of vermouth, which includes local fynbos among its 35 infusing ingredients in an intensely tangy-bitter orange-floral style. Belsazar Summer Edition Riesling VermouthGermany (from £22, waitrosecellar.com; thewhiskyexchange.com).German vermouth maker Belsazar is one of a new breed of producer paying as much attention to the wine as the botanicals. For example, this glorious concoction is based on riesling from top German winemaker Ernst Loosen and includes a little pineapple in the mix, too. Antica Formula Carpano VermouthItaly, (from £30.95, thewhiskyexchange.com; masterofmalt.com)A faithful reproduction by the Branca Distillery, of Fernet Branca fame, of both the hand-blown bottle and the recipe of the 1786 original Turin vermouth invented by Antonio Benedetto Carpano. Antica Formula is a kind of medicine for hedonists: a swirl of dried red fruit, sweet spice and mouth-tingling bitterness. Chinati Vergano VermouthItaly (£38, waywardwines.co.uk; gnarlyvines.co.uk)Retired chemist Mauro Vergano’s small-batch production of various aromatised wines includes this intensely aromatic take on classic Piedmontese vermouth, built from a month’s maceration of herbs, wormwood and other botanicals on a base of quality dry white cortese and moscato wine.",Lifestyle/Food,"How vermouth got cool (after being naff, kitsch and then retro…)",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/20/how-vermouth-got-cool-after-being-naff-kitsch-and-then-retro
2/20/2022,"There’s something odd about Rishi Sunak. The chancellor has rarely been out of the news since he took over at the Treasury from Sajid Javid two years ago and his approval rating with the public is high. His reputation as a safe pair of hands means he could be the next prime minister – yet we know little about what he believes. To the extent that while a picture of Sunak has emerged through the blizzard of budgets and mini budgets of a technocrat fascinated by Silicon Valley-style capitalism, in truth there have been only hints of an over-arching philosophy.  Sunak has the chance to do something about that when he gives the Mais lecture on Thursday, an event at which previous chancellors have taken the opportunity to lay out a credo. Nigel Lawson certainly did in 1984 when he rejected the postwar consensus that macro-economic policy (the big picture stuff such as interest rates, public spending and tax) should be about delivering full employment while control of inflation was the job of micro-economic policy (supply-side measures). In his Mais lecture 15 years later, Gordon Brown cavilled with Lawson’s notion that deregulation was the key to productivity growth but broadly agreed with his predecessor’s view of the role of the two halves of economic policy. Indeed, Brown had handed control of interest rates to the Bank of England in 1997 for this very reason. But the new orthodoxy only lasted for as long as the economy stayed out of serious trouble. In both the global financial crisis and, to an even greater extent during the Covid pandemic, demand management came back into fashion. Under Sunak, big picture macro-economic policy has all been about jobs and growth. The nitty-gritty, supply side stuff has taken a back seat because the past two years have been dominated by crisis management and damage limitation. In the circumstances, Sunak had no choice but to turn the Lawson-Brown orthodoxy on its head. His strategy was costly and unavoidable, and up to a point it has worked. Furloughing workers prevented a repeat of the mass, long-term unemployment that left such deep scars in the 1980s. The upshot has been a much bigger role for the state in the economy, a development that has been good for Sunak politically. It is because he was prepared to run the biggest peacetime budget deficit in history to save jobs that the chancellor is so popular. All of which will make the Mais lecture timely and fascinating. Sunak is supposed to be a small state, low tax Conservative who just happens to be in charge of the economy when taxes as a share of national output are on course to be the highest since Labour’s Hugh Gaitskell was doing the job in the early 1950s. Liz Truss, one of his rivals to succeed Boris Johnson, is making her pitch as a dry Thatcherite and it would be a surprise were Sunak to use Thursday’s event to try to outflank her on the right. Doubtless, there will be the usual talk of how it is important to knock the public finances back into shape yet that would be the message from any chancellor – Labour or Conservative – in the current circumstances. But Sunak will also note the importance of the state in supporting the economy in the past two years, arguing that as things return to normal the respective strengths of government and the market can be harnessed to stimulate innovation and improve Britain’s poor productivity record. The emphasis on productivity makes sense because – as the National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) thinktank points out – the pandemic has made a poor record over the past decade worse. It notes one of the hidden costs of Covid-19: as a result of missed schooling children from disadvantaged backgrounds have fallen even further behind their more-fortunate peers. The long-term effects will be an under-skilled workforce and lower productivity and a cost per pupil in lost lifetime earnings of up to £22,000. The report has some strong things to say about the deficiencies of economic policy: it is over-centralised and short-termist; industrial policy is too hands-off; investment in early years learning is inadequate and needs to return to the levels under Brown’s government. As a country, the report notes the UK has one of the poorest productivity performances among the OECD’s 38 advanced economies. Britain also stands out for having big productivity differences between and within regions. The gap between the richer and poorer parts of the country has grown wider. “If policymakers return to the same economic structures post-pandemic that failed to resolve the productivity problem pre-pandemic, then the UK is set for another decade of a low-growth, low-productivity and low-wage economy”, NIESR concludes. That all rings true, but the Treasury is always wary of devolving power, partly because it likes to be in control and partly because it thinks a bottom-up approach leads to the waste of public money. Covid loan fraud losses mean Sunak is not immune from that criticism himself. It is the goal of all chancellors and shadow chancellors to make the economy more productive. Before the 2010 election, George Osborne used his Mais lecture to call for an economic model that did away with a reliance on unsustainable and private debt. The wait for this game-changing model goes on, which is why Thursday is the time for the real Rishi Sunak to stand up.",News/Business,We know little about the real Rishi Sunak … but that may change this week,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/20/we-know-little-about-real-rishi-sunak-but-that-may-change-this-week-mais-lecture
2/20/2022,"Parts of the UK are set to be battered by another bout of hurricane-force winds as the newly named Storm Franklin threatens to cause travel chaos and fresh misery for tens of thousands of families left without power after Storm Eunice. The Met Office said Franklin would bring strong winds and heavy rain across much of the country and gusts of up to 80mph in Northern Ireland in the early hours of Monday.  It is the first time the Met Office has named three storms within a week since its naming system began in 2015. The latest severe weather event will pose a challenge for engineers attempting to reconnect the 83,000 households in England and Wales who remain without power following Storm Eunice. A Met Office spokesman said an amber weather warning for strong winds was in place for Northern Ireland between midnight and 7am on Monday, likely to bring power cuts, damage to buildings, flying debris and danger to life. He added that gusts would widely reach 60-70 mph in Northern Ireland and up to 80mph on the northern coast. Storm Eunice caused what providers believe was a record national power outage over a 24-hour period on Friday, with about 1.4m homes affected. Four fatalities have been confirmed, with many more injured by flying debris or falling trees. The Energy Networks Association said approximately 29,000 customers in south-west England remained without power on Sunday morning, as well as 23,000 in the south-east and a further 20,000 in the wider south of England. About 3,000 households remain without power in south Wales. The recovery effort from Storm Eunice was being hampered by strong winds across most of England and Wales on Sunday, where a yellow weather warning was in place covering most of the next 24 hours. Environment agencies have also issued hundreds of alerts for flooding across the UK. The worst of the flooding is expected in the north and west of England, large stretches of central Scotland including the Western Isles and Orkney, and along the River Severn in Wales. A Met Office spokesman said strong winds and heavy rain would probably mean disruption to the start of the working week, particularly in Northern Ireland, which looks like it will experience the worst of Storm Franklin. He said: “It will be a fairly blustery week but a bit more typical of what we usually see at this time of year. It will for some not be welcome but the winds will be down a notch from what we saw last week.” The Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Andy Page, said: “Following the significant impacts of Storm Eunice on Friday, Storm Franklin will bring further high winds for many late on Sunday and into Monday, although not on the same scale as Eunice. “Coastal areas of Northern Ireland, especially on that north coast, will get the strongest wind gusts, which could be around 80mph in a few places. Amber and yellow wind warnings have been issued, and people should remain cautious ahead of the system that will bring 50-60mph wind gusts for much of the UK from late on Sunday and through Monday.”",News/UK news,Storm Franklin threatens UK with more travel chaos and power cuts,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/storm-franklin-threatens-uk-weather-with-more-travel-chaos-and-power-cuts
