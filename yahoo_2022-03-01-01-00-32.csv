3/1/2022,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey called Russia's invasion of Ukraine a ""war"" on Sunday in a rhetorical shift that could pave the way for the NATO member nation to enact an international pact limiting Russian naval passage to the Black Sea. Under the 1936 Montreux Convention, Turkey has control over the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits that connect the Mediterranean and Black seas and can limit the passage of warships during wartime or if threatened. Balancing its Western commitments and close ties to Moscow, Ankara has said the Russian attack is unacceptable but until Sunday had not described the situation as a war. ""On the fourth day of the Ukraine war, we repeat President (Tayyip) Erdogan's call for an immediate halt of Russian attacks and the start of ceasefire negotiations,"" presidential spokesperson Ibrahim Kalin said on Twitter. Fahrettin Altun, Turkey's communications director, said ""we are witnessing yet another war in our region"", and repeated Erdogan's offer to mediate Kyiv has appealed to Ankara to block any more Russian warships from passing toward the Black Sea, from which Moscow has launched one of its incursions on Ukraine's southern coast. But Turkey's foreign minister said on Friday that Russia had the right under Montreux to return ships to their home base, which could limit any Turkish policy shift. Turkey has cultivated good ties with both Russia and Ukraine. Any step too far against Moscow could harm its heavy energy and commodity imports and its tourism sector at a time of domestic economic turmoil.

3/1/2022,"A chapter leader in the far-right Proud Boys extremist gang was charged with assault Sunday in Akron, Ohio, after he was recorded shouting racial epithets at a black woman and then sucker-punching her in the face. A man police identified as Andrew Walls, 26, was caught on video outside a bar in the early hours of Sunday, stumbling and scuffling with other patrons while spewing a torrent of racial slurs. His victim, 23-year-old Cameron Morgan, was passing by with a friend when she heard Walls and others around him screaming “Fucking niggers.” She later told her father that she confronted Walls after realizing she was the only Black person around. “We were like ... ‘You can’t say that. That’s not OK,’” she told her dad, local teacher and former sportswriter David Lee Morgan Jr., who recorded the conversation and provided a transcript to HuffPost. Video taken by Cameron Morgan’s friend shows what happened next: Walls squares up, points his finger at Morgan, and repeats the racist slur, adding: “Bitch, shut your mouth.” He then cocks his right fist and punches her directly in the face, the impact of which releases a blood-curdling pop. Morgan was treated for a concussion. WARNING: The video below contains graphic violence and racist language. Walls kept going after the recording ended, and dragged Cameron into the street by her hair, her father said. She was shaken up, he said, and left the scene without initially calling police. But once the video began to make the rounds on social media Sunday, activists quickly identified the assailant as Walls. They also unearthed a previous story about him in the local Akron Beacon Journal, which identified him as the vice president of the Akron-Canton chapter of the Proud Boys. According to this article (with photo) Andrew Walls is also the vice-president of the Akron-Canton chapter of the Proud Boys. https://t.co/mv9ZThIxBL — Steven Sean Laing (@Venusisaband) February 27, 2022 Though Walls wasn’t wearing his Proud Boys uniform — a black and yellow Fred Perry polo — during the assault, his membership in the gang suggests a predisposition for violence and bigotry. The Proud Boys, designated as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and a terrorist organization by Canada, have close ties to white supremacist groups and other extremists, and violence is literally written into their rules. (The gang’s highest rank, known as the Fourth Degree, is given only to members who commit a significant act of violence “for the cause.”) Walls’ chapter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Reached by phone Sunday, David Morgan’s voice trembled as he recalled waking up to see a video on his phone of his daughter being assaulted. “Soon as we saw it, I was in tears,” he said. “I just cried, because, I just watched somebody punch my daughter, who wouldn’t hurt a fly. Morgan said his daughter went to an urgent care clinic and was treated for a concussion after she saw stars and blacked out. Her face swelled up temporarily, to the point where she couldn’t move her jaw. “She couldn’t really open up her mouth to eat,” he said. Walls was charged with possessing a firearm while intoxicated and assault, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. The severity of Cameron’s injuries may lead to his assault charge being upgraded to a felony, the Akron Beacon Journal reports. Akron police are also considering an added ethnic intimidation charge. David Morgan said the revelation of Walls’ Proud Boys affiliation changed everything for him. He said he was aware of the gang and the national tour of political violence they’d been on since their founding in 2016, but he “never thought it would hit home until today.” “This changes a lot for me, in the sense that, I want to get involved now,” he said. “This happening was time for me to wake the hell up. And I hate that my daughter had to suffer that for me to wake the hell up.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

3/1/2022,"Actor Samuel L. Jackson, a man known for saying an expletive or two, has weighed in on the Joe Rogan controversy. Recently, the white shock jock’s name was plastered across national headlines after clips of him saying the N-word were leaked on social media. The compiled excerpts from various episodes of his podcast where he colorfully and boldly used the word since has gone viral. Rogan has apologized for his use of the racial epithet, noting that the word is unique because only certain people can use it. He said, “There is not another word like it in the entire English language because it’s a word where only one group of people is allowed to use it — and they can use it in so many different ways. “If a White person uses it, it’s racist, it’s toxic. But a Black person can use it and it can be a punchline, it can be a term of endearment, it can be lyrics to a rap song, it can be a positive affirmation,” Rogan said. “It’s a very unusual word, but it’s not my word to use. I’m well aware of it now.” Jackson agreed it is not Rogan or anyone in his race’s word to use. “There is no context where a white person is ever allowed to say that word, never mind publicly on a podcast,” the “Do The Right Thing” actor said in an interview with Yahoo! Entertainment. “He is saying nobody understood the context when he said it,” he continued. “But he shouldn’t have said it. It’s not the context, dude — it’s that he was comfortable doing it. Say that you’re sorry because you want to keep your money, but you were having fun and you say you did it because it was entertaining.” In the past, Jackson has made exceptions to his rule. White men can use the term when they are working on a film, and it fits into the authentic narrative of the character. Jamie Foxx spoke about this in a 2020 interview with Republic World. He said that after DiCaprio confessed his reservations with reading his lines, he and Jackson had to explain to him that this is just a function of his job. Regardless of how much the Black ensemble told him that it was okay to say the word, DiCaprio never was comfortable, including with the narcissism and racist nature of his character. DiCaprio couldn’t find a way to justify using the word and only did so because the movie stakeholders, especially Jackson, made him.

3/1/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Toyota Motor Corp said it will suspend domestic factory operations on Tuesday, losing around 13,000 cars of output, after a supplier of plastic parts and electronic components was hit by a suspected cyber attack. No information was immediately available about who was behind the possible attack or the motive. The attack comes just after Japan joined Western allies in clamping down on Russia after it invaded Ukraine, although it was not clear if the attack was at all related. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said his government would investigate the incident and whether Russia was involved. ""It is difficult to say whether this has anything to do with Russia before making thorough checks,"" he told reporters. Kishida on Sunday announced that Japan would join the United States and other countries in blocking some Russian banks from accessing the SWIFT international payment system. He also said Japan would give Ukraine $100 million in emergency aid. A spokesperson at the supplier, Kojima Industries Corp, said it appeared to have been the victim of some kind of cyber attack. A spokesperson from Toyota described it as a ""supplier system failure."" The company does not yet know if the halt at its 14 plants in Japan, which account for about a third of its global production, will last more than a day, the spokesperson added. Some plants operated by Toyota's affiliates Hino Motors and Daihatsu are included in the shutdown. Toyota, which has experienced cyber attacks in the past, is a pioneer of Just-In-Time manufacturing with parts that arrive from suppliers going straight to the production line rather than being stockpiled. State actors have launched cyberattacks on Japanese corporations in the past, including an attack on Sony Corp in 2014, which exposed internal data and shut down computer systems. The United States blamed North Korea for that attack, which came after Sony released ""The Interview"", a comedy about a plot to assassinate the regime's leader Kim Jong Un. Toyota's production halt comes as the world's biggest automaker is already tackling supply chain disruptions around the world caused by the COVID pandemic, which has forced it and other carmakers to curb output. Toyota this month also saw some production stopped in North America due to parts shortages caused by the Canadian trucker protests.

A patient’s unexpected death during a study has given us the first recording of a dying human brain. Scientists managed to capture the unique event while monitoring the brain waves of an 87-year-old-epilepsy patient. During the study, the patient experienced a heart attack and died while still being monitored. It’s a unique situation and one that has given us a new glimpse into how the brain reacts at the time of death. Don't Miss: Amazon Prime price is going up, here’s how to pay the lower fee Today's Top Deals KN95 masks made in the USA are in stock and discounted at Amazon! Brand new AirPods Pro with MagSafe are so cheap it might be a mistake You won't believe how good the Amazon deals are on this special page! While the study wasn’t designed to record a dying human brain, it did give us some great insight. The researchers recorded around 15 minutes of brain activity surrounding the time that the heart stopped beating. To see how the brain reacts at death, though, they focused on two 30 second intervals surrounding the exact time that the heart stopped. Upon inspection, they discovered gamma oscillations in the recording. Gamma oscillations are brainwaves we associate with dreaming, memory retrieval, and meditation. As such, the phrase “my whole life flashed before my eyes” might be that far off. Based on what they saw in the recordings, the researchers say that the brain may actually play a recall of important events in our lives when we die. It’s an interesting concept, and one that many have believed for years anyway. To see it finally solidified with scientific research is exciting, though. While exciting, the results of this study have also brought about some additional questions. For one, Dr. Ajmal Zemmar, the lead author of the study, says that the findings challenge our understanding of when life ends (via New Atlas). It also raises some important questions regarding the time that organs are harvested for donation, too. The research shows that the mind continues to work in a dying human brain, even when the blood has stopped flowing to it. This means its capable of coordinated activity even after death. This isn’t the first time we’ve seen these kinds of waves in dying brains, though. We’ve also previously seen these waves in dying rats. However, this is the first time we’ve seen it in a dying human brain. Which makes it even more intriguing. This is just a single case study, though. For any definitive results, we would need to have access to a much larger pool of information. Even then, there are other factors to consider, too. This patient suffered from epilepsy, though. As such, the results from other dying human brains could be quite different. The researchers have said they hope to continue studying the process.

3/1/2022,"KAUNAS AIRPORT, Lithuania (Reuters) - A military aircraft carrying Norwegian troop reinforcements landed in Lithuania on Sunday, part of a wider NATO buildup in the Baltic region following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Norwegian troops - 44 soldiers from a mechanised infantry battalion - will join the alliance's enhanced forward presence battlegroup in Lithuania, deployed since 2017 in response to Russia's takeover of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine. Norwegian enforcements also include four CV90 infantry fighting vehicles, three of which were transported by a separate plane, an Ukrainian-made Antonov An-124. ""In my company I have main battle tanks, I have new CV90s, highly technological, and a lot of other vehicles,"" said Captain Endre Saurstroe, commander of Norwegian troops in Lithuania. Germany also increased number of its troops in Lithuania earlier in February. The size of NATO battlegroups in Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, once ruled from Moscow but now part of the European Union, are set to almost double from 3,400 troops at the start of the year to more than 6,000 in the near future. Ukrainian forces battled Russian troops pushing into the city of Kharkiv on Sunday on the fourth day of an invasion that has shaken Europe's long-standing security architecture.

3/1/2022,"BEIJING (AP) — China's top diplomat called on the U.S. Monday to take steps to improve ties, as tensions simmer over Taiwan, trade and other issues. Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s remarks Monday were delivered virtually to a forum marking the 50th anniversary of the Shanghai Communique signed during the icebreaking 1972 visit to China by President Richard Nixon. That trip led seven years later to the U.S. and China establishing diplomatic relations, upon which the U.S. cut formal ties with Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory to be brought under its control by force if necessary. Wang urged Washington to “reinstate a reasonable and pragmatic China policy” and work with China to put their relations on track. He reiterated China’s complaints that the U.S. was not upholding its commitments but didn't mention any specific steps China would take. The sides need to view their relations “in the broader perspective, with a more inclusive attitude, and choose dialogue over confrontation, cooperation over conflict, openness over seclusion, and integration over decoupling,"" Wang said. China has been particularly irked by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's characterization of ties as “competitive when it should be, collaborative when it can be, adversarial when it must be,"" saying the sides should be cooperating across the board, in spite of their sharp differences. “The United States should truly see China as a partner in the course of development, rather than an adversary, and power games,"" Wang said. Rapprochement between Washington and Beijing in 1972 was largely drive by their mutual distrust of the Soviet Union. In the decades since, China has grown increasingly close to Moscow, while U.S.-Russia tensions have soared over the war in Ukraine. Chinese leader Xi Jinping met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing earlier this month and China has refused to either condemn or endorse Russia’s actions, despite its insistence on upholding national sovereignty above all. China, along with India and the United Arab Emirates, abstained in Friday’s 11-1 vote on a U.N. Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry said the imposition of sanctions on Russia would “disrupt the process of political settlement.” “China must decide where to stand and understand that bilateral relations with the U.S. will only become more strained in the absence of a clear choice to stand with international law,” said forum participant Jacob Lew, chair of the influential National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and a former U.S. treasury secretary. The Shanghai Communique dwelled extensively on the status of Taiwan, which split from the mainland amid civil war in 1949 and has never been governed by the communist People's Republic of China. Following the 1979 break in ties with Taiwan, the U.S. Congress passed legislation assuring that the U.S. would ensure Taiwan could defend itself and treat threats to the island as issues of “major concern."" Taiwan continues to be the main irritant in U.S.-China relations, particularly as successive U.S. administrations have approved arms sales to the island and increased high-level contacts with the democratically elected government in Taipei. On Saturday, China's Defense Ministry protested as provocative the passage of the guided-missile destroyer USS Ralph Johnson through the Taiwan Strait. The Strait is in international waters and the U.S. Navy said the ship’s passage “demonstrates the United States’ commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military flies, sails and operates anywhere international law allows.”",World/Associated Press,"As tensions simmer, China demands US action to improve ties",https://news.yahoo.com/tensions-simmer-china-demands-us-062020058.html

The Russian ruble crashed Monday and Russia's central bank nearly doubled its base interest rate. Western sanctions were ""heavy"" and ""problematic"" but could be countered, a Kremlin spokesperson said. The Kremlin said Monday that Russia's ""economic reality"" had ""considerably changed"" in the face of ""heavy"" and ""problematic"" Western sanctions. The admission came after Russia's ruble plunged 30% against the US dollar and the country's central bank more than doubled its base interest rate, to 20%. Russians were reportedly waiting in long lines to withdraw foreign currencies from ATMs. Western nations have united to impose sweeping sanctions on Russia after it attacked Ukraine, such as cutting off Russian banks from Swift, the international bank payment system; hindering the ability of Russia's central bank to deploy its foreign exchange reserves; and freezing assets linked to President Vladimir Putin. On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Putin would meet with Russia's top central banking and finance officials, as well as the CEO of Sberbank, one of the country's leading lenders. An FT reporter described the planned meeting as ""an emergency meeting."" Peskov said Russia had ""the potential to offset the harm"" caused by the West's sanctions. However, per Reuters, he said: ""The economic reality has considerably changed. These are heavy sanctions, they are problematic."" He continued: ""Russia has been making plans for quite a long time for possible sanctions, including the most severe ones. There are response plans, they were developed and are being implemented as problems appear."" He added: ""We have had no reason to doubt the effectiveness and reliability of our central bank. There is no reason to doubt it now."" Peskov also said that Putin was ""quite indifferent"" about the sanctions leveled against him directly. ""The sanctions contain absurd claims about some assets,"" Peskov said. The European Central Bank said Monday that Sberbank's European operations ""are failing or likely to fail."" The ECB said that Sberbank's European operations ""experienced significant deposit outflows as a result of the reputational impact of geopolitical tensions.

3/1/2022,"(Adds details on siege warfare, quotes) By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Russia, frustrated by early battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, could be shifting its strategy to siege warfare just as President Vladimir Putin raises the risk of a catastrophic miscalculation by putting nuclear forces on heightened alert, a senior U.S. defense official said on Sunday. Putin gave the order to his nuclear forces as Washington assesses that Russian troops have made limited progress in their four-day-old invasion due to stiff Ukrainian resistance and planning failures that have left some units without fuel or other supplies, U.S. officials said. As missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, hundreds of thousands of civilians, mainly women and children, were fleeing the Russian assault into neighboring countries. The United States assesses that Russia has fired more than 350 missiles at Ukrainian targets so far, some hitting civilian infrastructure, the senior U.S. defense official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Still, it had so far mainly focused on military targets. Citing a Russian offensive on the Ukrainian city of Chernihiv, north of Kyiv, the official cited early indications that Russia might be adopting siege tactics. ""It appears that they are adopting a siege mentality, which any student of military tactics and strategy will tell you, when you adopt siege tactics, it increases the likelihood of collateral damage,"" the official said. So far, the Russian offensive cannot claim any major victories. Russian has not taken any Ukrainian city, does not control Ukraine's airspace, and its troops remained roughly 30 km (19 miles) from Kyiv's city center for a second day, the official said. Siege tactics typically involve encircling enemy positions, cutting off supply and escape routes, then attacking with a combined force of armor, ground troops and engineers. The senior U.S. defense official said it remained to be seen what Russian forces would do next, but the early signs were worrying. ""The indications are enough in terms of how they're positioning their forces around the city (of Chernihiv), how they're beginning this barrage using rockets, that gives us concern,"" the official said. ""In order for a siege ... to be successful, you basically, by design, are going to be targeting civilian infrastructure and causing civilian harm."" Images on social media showed some Russian military vehicles in Ukraine, including battle tanks, that had apparently been abandoned after running out of fuel, raising questions about logistical failures. ""They simply don't have a lot of experience moving on another nation state at this level of complexity and size,"" the official said. The official said it was unclear whether it was a failure in planning or execution, but added that Russian forces were likely to adapt and overcome the challenges. Russia has still not moved into Ukraine about a third of the troops that Putin had arrayed around its borders, the official said. But it has rapidly increased the number of forces Moscow has sent into Ukraine in recent days. NUCLEAR RISK The Pentagon learned of the heightened Russian alert for its nuclear forces from Putin's televised announcement, the senior U.S. defense official said, instead of from American intelligence sources. Just after Putin spoke, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the top U.S. commander for Europe, General Tod Wolters, held a pre-scheduled meeting at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) at which they discussed the Russian president's decision. Although Washington was still gathering information, Putin's move was troubling, the official said. ""It's clearly, essentially, putting in play forces that, if there's a miscalculation, could make things much, much more dangerous,"" the official said. Asked whether the United States would continue to provide military assistance to Ukraine following Putin's announcement, the official said: ""That support is going to go forward."" Mick Mulroy, a former senior Pentagon official and retired CIA paramilitary officer, said he believed Putin's decision to elevate the alert of his nuclear forces was a reaction to battlefield losses. ""Russia placing its nuclear forces on alert is incredibly reckless and a clear indication that Putin realizes his military is not performing as expected in Ukraine,"" Murloy said.

3/1/2022,"(Reuters) -A referendum in Belarus on Sunday approved a new constitution ditching the country's non-nuclear status at a time when the former Soviet republic has become a launch pad for Russian troops invading Ukraine, Russian news agencies said. The agencies cited the Belarus central elections commission as saying 65.2% of those who took part voted in favor. The result came as little surprise, given the tightly controlled rule of President Alexander Lukashenko. The new constitution could see nuclear weapons on Belarusian soil for the first time since the country gave them up after the fall of the Soviet Union. It raises the stakes at a time when Lukashenko has fallen behind Russian President Vladimir Putin's military assault on Ukraine after earlier playing an intermediary role between the two neighbours. The West has already said it will not recognise the results of the referendum, which is taking place against the background of a sweeping crackdown on domestic opponents of the government. According to human rights activists, as of Sunday, there were more than a thousand political prisoners in Belarus. The referendum sparked anti-war protests in several cities. At least 290 people were detained, rights activists said. Protests had largely died down in Belarus after Lukashenko launched a violent crackdown on dissent against his 28-year-long rule. Mass protests had erupted in 2020 following a disputed election that opponents say Lukashenko rigged. On Sunday, speaking at a polling station, Lukashenko said he could ask Russia to return nuclear weapons to Belarus. ""If you (the West) transfer nuclear weapons to Poland or Lithuania, to our borders, then I will turn to Putin to return the nuclear weapons that I gave away without any conditions,"" Lukashenko said. Lukashenko turned to Russia after the 2020 protests, securing loans that offset the effect of Western sanctions. His rival in the 2020 vote, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, had called on Belarusians to use the vote to protest against the invasion. In videos and photos posted on social media, people gathered at polling stations in Minsk and other cities to protest. ""There is little we can do now, with all this terror and horror in which we live. But I wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't try to do something,"" said Elena, 45. She declined to provide more personal information for security reasons. The new constitution would give powers to the All-Belarusian People's Assembly, created by Lukashenko and populated by party loyalists, local councils, officials and activists of pro-government organizations. It would also give lifetime immunity from prosecution to the president once he left office.

McFaul added in a tweet that Putin might be disconnected from reality after decades in power. A former US ambassador to Russia said Sunday that, after decades in power and intense isolation from COVID-19, Russian President Vladimir Putin was becoming ""increasingly unhinged."" Michael McFaul, an Obama-era ambassador to Russia, made the observation during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" When asked whether Putin was a ""rational actor,"" McFaul said: ""To get kicked out of SWIFT as it happened to Russia yesterday, and then to have the president of Russia get in front of his generals and say, 'We need to prepare for nuclear war.' That doesn't sound very rational to me."" On Saturday, Western nations announced that some Russian banks would be removed from SWIFT, a global financial messaging system. McFaul, who said he first met Putin in 1991, expressed concern that the Russian leader had believed his own propaganda ""for decades."" ""Remember, this guy's been in power for 22 years. He doesn't listen to his aides. Even when I was ambassador eight years ago, he was very dismissive of anybody around him. He's out at his compound, doesn't come into town very much, and, under COVID, he's been more isolated,"" McFaul said. ""I sat in the room with him for five years when I worked in the Obama administration. I speak Russian. I listened to him, and I know what he says — he's increasingly unhinged in the way that he talks about the regime,"" McFaul added.

""That doesn't sound like somebody who's going to sit down and negotiate a peaceful outcome,"" McFaul said, referring to Putin. In a separate tweet Monday, McFaul reiterated why he thought people like Putin couldn't be reasoned with.

3/1/2022,"By Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Russia, frustrated by early battlefield setbacks in Ukraine, could be shifting its strategy to siege warfare just as President Vladimir Putin raises the risk of a catastrophic miscalculation by putting nuclear forces on heightened alert, a senior U.S. defense official said on Sunday. Putin gave the order to his nuclear forces as Washington assesses that Russian troops have made limited progress in their four-day-old invasion due to stiff Ukrainian resistance and planning failures that have left some units without fuel or other supplies, U.S. officials said. As missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, hundreds of thousands of civilians, mainly women and children, were fleeing the Russian assault into neighboring countries.
