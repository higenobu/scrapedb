2/15/2022,"Novak Djokovic says he would rather miss out on grand slams than be vaccinated against Covid, in his first major interview since being deported from Australia earlier this year due to his vaccination status. Djokovic told the BBC on Tuesday he was not anti-vaccination in general but believed people had the right to choose whether they were jabbed or not.  Asked if he would miss Wimbledon and the French Open over his vaccine stance, he replied: “That is the price that I’m willing to pay.” “The principles of decision making on my body are more important than any title or anything else,” Djokovic said. “I’m trying to be in tune with my body as much as I possibly can.” Djokovic said he had “always been a great student of wellness, wellbeing, health, nutrition”. “I was never against vaccination. I understand that, globally, everyone is trying to put a big effort into handling this virus and seeing, hopefully, an end soon to this virus,” he said. The 34-year-old did not rule being vaccinated for Covid in the future – telling the BBC he was keeping his “mind open”. “We are all trying to find, collectively, a best possible solution to end Covid,” he said. Djokovic was detained when he arrived in Melbourne in early January before a legal stoush ended with his deportation on the eve of the Australian Open. Djokovic was ultimately deported after Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, exercised his ministerial discretion to cancel the world No 1’s visa. Hawke’s determination that Djokovic’s participation in the Australian Open “may foster anti-vaccination” sentiment and cause “civil unrest” was upheld by the full federal court after the tennis star lodged a last-ditch appeal.

2/15/2022,"The attorney general, Michaelia Cash, has confirmed the commonwealth integrity commission is off the agenda until at least after the election, as the government can’t pass it without Labor support. The government is “not progressing with it at this stage”, the attorney general told Senate estimates on Tuesday, also confirming that despite two years of consultation no changes had been made to the Coalition model.  Earlier in February the prime minister, Scott Morrison, suggested there may still be a chance to legislate the anti-corruption body before the May election, a possible reference to a final attempt to get cabinet to agree to a beefed-up version of the integrity commission to boost the chances of passing the religious discrimination bill. Labor and the crossbench have all called for a tougher national integrity commission, with a Greens bill already having passed the Senate, and a crossbench bill supported by MP Helen Haines and Senator Rex Patrick also a viable model to pass parliament. But despite Liberal MP Bridget Archer crossing the floor to progress the national integrity commission, the government refuses to introduce its own bill to parliament to set the body up. Under questioning from Labor senators on Tuesday, Cash said: “In the terms of the model of the integrity commission in the legislation that is drafted, you don’t support our bill, you have not put forward an alternative to that bill. “And on that basis, at this point in time, we won’t be proceeding with it, because you do not support it. And we’ve always said we would require bipartisan support.” The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, described the admission as “another broken promise” from the Morrison government. BREAKING: Attorney-General Michaelia Cash confirms there will be NO Anti-Corruption Commission under the Liberals. Yet another Morrison broken promise. #Estimates pic.twitter.com/8BsXCm8I5A “To this day, Mr Morrison has still not even brought a bill before the Parliament,” he said in a statement. “Instead, all we’ve seen is scandal after scandal go unchecked, endless excuses and a weak, pathetic, desultory ‘exposure draft’ which was so bad, the Centre for Public Integrity denounced it is ‘a sham designed to cover up corruption’.” The Morrison government promised a national integrity commission in December 2018, ahead of the 2019 election, after months of dismissing it as a “fringe issue”. After missing its self-imposed 2019 deadline for draft legislation, the Coalition unveiled its proposed body in November 2020 for a commission that will not conduct public hearings or release reports into alleged corruption by public servants and politicians. The model was also panned by experts for the narrow definition of corruption and high bar to start investigations. Officials from the attorney general’s department at the hearing confirmed no changes were made to the draft legislation after consultation. Cash said: “The government believes that the model it has is the appropriate model.” Greens senator Larissa Waters, said the model was unchanged despite “experts [saying] it is a protection racket for MPs”. My bill for a strong corruption watchdog passed the Senate over 2 yrs ago. The Gov won’t bring it on for a vote. Their own model which experts say is a protection racket for MPs, is unchanged despite rounds of consultation. THEY. JUST. DONT. WANT. TO. BE.

2/15/2022,"Kamila Valieva’s legal team has claimed that her positive drugs test may have come from a contaminated glass of water that contained traces of her grandfather’s heart medication. Speaking after the daily media briefing in Beijing, International Olympic Committee member Denis Oswald confirmed the 15-year-old Russian’s explanation for her positive test for the banned angina drug trimetazidine was “contamination which happened with a product her grandfather was taking”.  The Russian newspaper Pravda said that Valieva’s lawyer Anna Kozmenko made a similar argument when the skater’s court of arbitration for sport hearing took place on Sunday. “There can be completely different ways how it got into her body,” Kozmenko is reported to have said. “For example, grandfather drank something from a glass, saliva got in, this glass was somehow later used by an athlete. Or the drug lay down on some surface, traces remained, the drug lay down on this surface, which the athlete then drank.” On Monday, Cas cleared Valieva to compete in the women’s skating event, which starts on Tuesday and concludes Thursday, and for which she is the heavy favourite for gold. However if she does claim a medal the IOC has already said there will be no ceremony afterwards. Meanwhile the Russian’s doping case is ongoing and it could mean that her results – and any medals – from Beijing are stripped from her in the months ahead. On Tuesday Valieva, who helped the Russian team win gold last week, broke her silence by saying that the trimetazidine doping scandal has left her tearful and “emotionally fatigued”. She told Russia’s TV Channel One: “These days have been very difficult for me, emotionally. I am happy but emotionally fatigued. That is why these tears of joy and a little bit of sadness. But, of course, I am happy to take part in the Olympic Games. I will do my utmost to represent our country. “Apparently, this is a stage I have to live through,” she added. “I hear so many good wishes. I have seen outdoor banners in Moscow. It is very pleasing, this support is very important for me in this difficult time. I thought I was alone but my closest friends and family will never abandon me.” Cas has confirmed that Valieva testified during its lengthy hearing, which ended at about 3am on Monday. Valieva said she watched the entire hearing by video link from the Olympic Village.“I sat there for seven hours, we had one 20-minute break, and I sat there and watched. It was very difficult, but it is apparently one of the moments, of the phases, that I have to go through,” Valieva said, adding that the entire process had taught her that adult life “can be unfair to some extent”. Valieva and her entourage will be investigated by the Russian Anti-Doping Agency and the World Anti-Doping Agency after the Olympics. But even if the Russian investigation clears her, the ruling will likely be appealed. Meanwhile Oswald confirmed that the IOC has still not received the reasoned decision from Cas on Valieva. He also defended the IOC’s decision not to ban Russia and its athletes completely from the Olympics after the discovery of a massive state-sponsored doping programme in 2016. Oswald said the IOC did all that it could, and that sanctions had to be proportionate. “We took very tough measures after the 2014 Games, when the situation with doping in Russia came to light,” he added. “And 29 athletes were punished. We cannot punish clean athletes, even if they are Russians.”",Sport/Sport,Valieva team claim positive test may be due to grandfather’s heart medication,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/15/kamila-valieva-skater-positive-doping-grandfathers-heart-medication

2/15/2022,"  Most people don’t want to talk about money on a first date, and it can be a bigger taboo in relationships than sex, politics or religion. But however unromantic, having conversations about how you manage your cash is important. According to counselling service Relate, money worries are the most common reason for relationship difficulties. “Tackling the topic early on avoids the potential for resentments to emerge later and lead to more destructive arguments,” says a Relate counsellor, Peter Saddington. Early on you could start by, for example, asking someone if they are a spender or saver, or what they dream of achieving with their money, in order to understand your respective financial situations. “If there are issues later – debts, bills, or how much you want to save, or not – it’s more likely to be something you can do successfully, without rupturing the relationship, as money is already a topic you discuss,” adds Saddington. As a relationship becomes more serious and your lives more entwined, there will be conversations about money that must be had. You will need to find a way to be clear about your expectations – for example, whether and to what extent you want to merge your finances, and what expenses will be shared. If you are struggling to start these conversations, take the pressure off by suggesting you both write down, separately, how you want to manage your finances as a couple, before sitting down to compare and agree on anything. “Money can be an emotional issue, so it needs a practical approach, where each partner feels listened to,” says Arabella Russell, a couples psychotherapist. “I’d encourage drawing up a plan of the points you need to address so that you’re prepared for the conversation, and approach it almost like a business meeting.” You might ultimately agree, for example, to have a pot for joint spending and bills, and work out your contributions, although these may change over time. You may also want to set spending limits, where anything above a certain figure requires a joint decision. If you are unmarried, this can be set out in a cohabitation agreement when you move in or at a later date. This is a legal document setting out financial contributions and who owns what. Schedule a time to talk to your partner about money – perhaps once a month – and use the conversation to cover everything from bills and spending to savings. However, keep these “dates” brief, ideally about 20 minutes. “This will make it more likely you’ll stick to the points and avoid old arguments,” says Saddington, who stresses that talking about money can feel threatening and make us defensive. “Limiting the time potentially avoids it becoming a heated conversation, and don’t have the discussion late at night, or when you’ve been drinking alcohol.” Avoid bringing any resentments into the conversation, or shame if your partner is struggling, and stick to facts. You can also use this time to address any money worries, and future goals, such as where you want to live and what you want to do, and create a joint long-term plan. Ensure you have enough time to talk and listen to each other. The foundations of a relationship are built on trust, so fibbing about finances is never wise. However, two-fifths of Britons are keeping “money secrets”, including hiding debt problems, according to research by the Money and Pensions Service. James Jones, the head of consumer affairs at the credit agency Experian, says that shared accounts can make it more difficult to keep debts hidden. “Although credit checks are on the person, not the address, many couples’ credit histories will be linked by shared accounts, such as a joint mortgage or current account,” he explains. “Any hidden debts could surface during a future credit application and, as a result, cause an unpleasant surprise.” Remember that you may well take a different approach to money to your partner. You may be a cautious saver, for example, while your partner is a spontaneous and impulsive spender, and being honest about your personal circumstances will encourage your partner to be the same. We all have different “money stories” that are linked to our upbringing and play out in our relationships, Russell says. But, she adds, often couples don’t realise this, which is why conversations about the issue sometimes go wrong. “Perhaps one partner was brought up with tension around money and financial difficulties, and that could lead to fear of living in that uncertainty again,” she says. She suggests asking about your partner’s experiences growing up and, if you have repetitive arguments, trying to find out what’s at the root of these. “The more you can have conversations that go well and there’s understanding and no shame involved, the easier it is to be honest,” she says. You are also more likely to go to each other for help with a problem if you understand where you are each coming from. If you are having trouble tackling financial issues as a couple, there is help available. Go to your local Citizens Advice to talk about practical matters together, such as being unable to afford escalating bills, and managing debts. You may want to try a counsellor or couples coach specialising in financial issues. Use the Counselling Directory search tool to find a couples counsellor, with sessions online, by telephone or in person. You can eavesdrop on a relationship counsellor helping couples talk about money in BBC Radio 4’s The Money Clinic. There are also lots of free financial lessons and budgeting tools you could do together. Relate’s website features quizzes, while the government-sponsored MoneyHelper website has guides to help trigger conversations with your partner. “If you can work on honing communication, this will have advantages across your whole relationship,” Russell says. Your relationship, and your bank balance, will hopefully be stronger as a result.",Lifestyle/Money,Money dates: how to talk to your partner about your finances,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/feb/15/money-dates-how-to-talk-to-your-partner-about-your-finances
2/15/2022,"There are some general rules around surprising surveys, such as: when a result isn’t what you’d expect, it’s often because the question was posed in a peculiar way, or the conclusion has taken an unreasonable leap. Then there are some specific rules, such as: if you want to know the truth about what makes a marriage last, don’t necessarily go first to a thinktank that is avowedly pro-marriage – maybe try a more neutral source. These rules collided, or should have done, at the weekend, when the Marriage Foundation announced that couples who had really expensive weddings were less likely to stay together than those who did it on the cheap. One in 10 marriages that cost over £20,000 had ended within three years. So, some people, at least, have escaped the sunk cost fallacy. Marriage and divorce experts were quick to comment: it was surely down to the fairytale expectation that £20,000 creates. After that much white tulle and the delightful country house, the brutal reality of life in athleisure, and a not-country house, was too much to take. And it brings a certain narratorial satisfaction: anyone who blows a fortune on a single day must surely be shallow, and incapable of doing dreary or lasting work.  But the Marriage Foundation is missing something major, here, which is weird because it comes from their own research: second marriages are more likely to last than the first ones, with 31% ending in divorce against 45%. If there’s one thing all second marriages have in common, it’s not the age and definitely not the wisdom of the participants, but rather, that they’re definitely, positively still skint from the dissolution of the first marriage. So they can’t have a massive, meringue-style wedding, and their no-frills, pay-bar nuptials have skewed the data. This is how to make a marriage last – not with small economies, but by taking the precaution of a previous, failed marriage.

2/15/2022,"The US could see loosened guidance around prescribing opioids, as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) considers relaxing some of its guidelines in a move that could signal a new direction for managing chronic pain. The CDC last Thursday released proposed changes to its guidance on prescribing opioids, rolling back limits on which doses can be prescribed and for how many days in cases of acute pain.  The agency created rules in 2016 to reduce prescriptions that were fueling the opioid overdose epidemic. But as rules like these were put in place, opioid overdose deaths rose instead of falling. New laws in several states were drafted to codify the restrictions, and some insurers began basing their coverage of medications on the guidance. The sweeping actions cut off medications for some patients battling chronic pain and substance disorders, sometimes without the option of tapering down the medications or undergoing substance dependence treatment. As the sources of medications dried up, some patients turned to illicit substances like heroin and fentanyl. “You’re inadvertently driving people to an illicit supply if they’re being cut off,” said Kate Nicholson, executive director of the National Pain Advocacy Center. “The street supply is so tainted that you’re really pushing people to a very dangerous thing.” Fatal overdoses rose from 63,000 in 2016 to more than 100,000 last year, many of them driven by the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. Deaths from fentanyl have doubled in the US in the past two years – but teens in particular have been hit hard by fentanyl overdoses, with the death rate tripling in that time. Yet harm reduction groups have struggled to access affordable naloxone, the drug that reverses opioid overdoses. And only one state, Arizona, had enough naloxone in 2017 to prevent a majority of overdose deaths, according to a study published in the Lancet on Thursday. For patients like Bev Schechtman, the 2016 CDC rules made what would have been a routine hospitalization traumatic. Schechtman has Crohn’s disease, and frequently suffers from kidney stones – sometimes several times a month. In 2017, a case of kidney stones grew too difficult to treat at home. She checked into the hospital because she was worried she was developing an infection and she was vomiting too much to keep food, water and prescribed painkillers down. It was something she’d done several times before. But on this visit, Schechtman said, she was inexplicably denied intravenous painkillers because the doctor believed she was at higher risk of addiction since she had survived abuse as a child. “He said, ‘Childhood sexual abuse changes your brain chemistry, and so do IV opioids, and so I can’t be part of that,’” Schechtman recalled. She was floored – and horrified. “They’re using something that was already traumatic from my childhood, something that already is this painful experience that wasn’t my fault. And I felt like it was being used against me to punish me for – for what?” That question nagged at her. When she was home and finally recovered, she started digging. “Until then, I had no idea what the CDC guidelines were, I didn’t know any of this stuff,” Schechtman said. Since then, she has become an outspoken proponent of pain management and the vice-president of the non-profit Doctor Patient Forum. She believes her experience happened because of an over-reliance on the stringent rules, and she applauded the new direction in guidance. But the changes shouldn’t stop there, she said. “If these guidelines go through the way they are, then we have a lot of work ahead of us, because now we have to get them removed from state laws, we have to get them removed from the insurance companies.” Drugmakers in the 1990s marketed new opioids as less addictive and pushed for wider use among patients. “We overdid it with prescription medications – we were kind of sold a bill of goods by pharmaceutical companies that told us, no, these things are not addictive,” said Bryce Pardo, associate director of the Rand Corporation’s Drug Policy Research Center. In reaction to the rising opioid overdose crisis, new rules in the late 2000s made it more difficult to prescribe the drugs – and around the same time, overdose deaths from illicit opioids began rising. “We turned the tap off too quickly without really trying to increase the access to drug treatment programs,” Pardo said. Substance dependence treatment didn’t expand as quickly as patients needed. “I think that’s what CDC is trying to do by relaxing some of the prescription guidelines now because they realize, well, we may have overdone it by trying to cut people off too quickly,” Pardo said. But, he argued, the guidance shouldn’t go too far in the other direction: “We ping-pong back and forth between extremes.” The new guidelines need to strike a delicate balance between making sure patients with serious pain have access to the medications they need, but also not introducing new patients unnecessarily to opioids, he said. People in chronic pain can “manage their lives fine on an opioid – that’s fine. What we don’t want is a 19-year-old who blew out his knee at football practice getting 90 days’ worth of prescription medication.” It’s difficult to reach that balance, said Nicholson, who called it “the Goldilocks solution”. “There was a harm from overly liberal prescribing, so I do think the CDC stepped in in order to try and stem that harm,” she said. But “the people who actually needed it got caught in the crosshairs of this pendulum swing.” She was on an advisory board to review an earlier draft of CDC guidelines last year. She said the new guidance, which incorporated the independent advisers’ feedback, is “a tremendous improvement for people with chronic pain”.",News/US news,US could loosen some restrictions on prescribing opioids,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/15/us-could-loosen-opioids-guidelines-cdc
2/15/2022,"This is the story of a band that’s always on the brink: of stardom, of madness, of brilliance, of disgrace. Fat White Family, the cult indie band started in 2011 by brothers Lias and Nathan Saoudi, along with Saul Adamczewski, have had an unsettled lineup and a bumpy career. Based in grimy south London and feted as a brilliant, incendiary live act, the band’s records have earned mixed reviews, and their antics – sometimes naked, often provocative, usually drug-fuelled – tend to overshadow their art and their ambitions. Ten Thousand Apologies, with its detailed descriptions of fuck-ups and come-downs, of opportunities missed and decisions untaken, isn’t going to change this reputation. Towards the end, author Adelle Stripe, who co-writes with Lias, describes the FWF as “a drug band with a rock problem”; a great line that could be applied to many excellent bands but is especially accurate here. The latter part of the book describes a gradually tightening noose of drug excess and utter chaos. If that sounds sexy, well, Stripe understands the Fat Whites’ scummy romantic appeal. The bleak and the funny overlap throughout.  Stripe is known for her imaginative novel/biography of Andrea Dunbar, Black Teeth and a Brilliant Smile, and this book, too, though it reads pretty close to the truth, emphasises that “fact has been used to create fiction” and that people remember events differently. The difference here is Stripe is writing with, as well as about, her subject. Though she has done her work, interviewing Nathan and Saul extensively, as well as others, this book both starts and ends with Lias. He’s the main source of what happened when and to whom, and personally takes over the storytelling in the italicised parts of the book. We hear about the Saoudis’ background: their mum, Michelle, grew up in working-class Huddersfield; their dad, Bashir, came to England from Algeria. (Some of the book’s strongest sections are the descriptions of the Saoudis’ visits to their dad’s extended family.) After their parents split up, the young Saoudi boys move with their mother to Northern Ireland, to Cookstown, a narrow-minded loyalist stronghold. Lias turns to art to save himself from the grimness (there is an excellent Schiele-esque self-portrait in the book); it leads him to London and the Slade art school. Grim, too, is Saul’s south London childhood: bullied, suicidal, defiant, he ends up, aged 14, in a boarding school for troubled youths. Self-immolation and extreme attention-seeking are, you could argue, the logical adult result. When they meet, the central relationship of Lias and Saul starts badly (of course), but they soon bond: “Despite the respective shadiness of both our characters, it was something you could have a bit of faith in,” writes Lias. I once interviewed Lias and Saul for the Observer (a precis of the interview is in the book). I liked them a lot, though they argued from start to finish, and Saul eventually stormed off, supposedly because he couldn’t stand to be in the interview any longer, but really because he needed to score. Days later, he checked into rehab in the US for a crippling heroin problem. When he leaves, “clean and sober for the first time since he was 12”, according to Ten Thousand Apologies, he is welcomed back to the fold with a few lines of cocaine. If you’re doing drugs, the difference between smack and coke seems vast and obvious; if you’re not, such actions seem completely mad. And madness reigns for much of this book, where, at most points, at least one member is having some form of chemically induced mental or physical breakdown. The anecdotes pile up. Laugh! As a band member ignores the active threat of the Bataclan terrorist attack in order to score! Weep! As a woman with cancer has her last days ruined by the Fat Whites’ noise and chaos next door! Gibber! At a Glastonbury where Nathan has champagne chucked in his face by band hero Mark E Smith and retaliates by chucking some cider into Smith’s face! Actually, Lias’s description of that festival – the grubby glamour, the sweaty tent – is so accurate that it could bring on a sympathetic nervous breakdown. The excess disguises the true heart of Ten Thousand Apologies, which is a sort of yearning: a search for enlightenment, a way to live, but especially for a home. The Saoudis feel the disconnect of the offspring of an immigrant parent; Adamczewski is unsettled, in all senses. They are restless, without respite. Still, Brixton is made for people like the Fat Whites, and for a while they survive there, in squats and drug dens and, in one of the funniest sections, in the Queen’s Head pub on Stockwell Road, where the landlord lets them live. Gradually, rental prices soar so high that they’re squeezed out. You could see the entire Fat Whites’ story as a quest – an epic, swashbuckling, decade-long battle – simply to bag some affordable housing. There isn’t much peace in this book, which is what makes it such an interesting read. But interesting lives are hard to live. Just as the band finally seem to be breaking through to the mainstream, Covid lockdowns stop their momentum and they’re back on their uppers again, skint, nowhere to live. “We were at liberty to heap ridicule and scorn upon anyone and everything that didn’t quite add up in the world,” writes Lias about the band’s early years. It can take time to realise that the happiness that you sneer at in others is available to you. I sincerely hope that this book, along with everything else the Fat Whites create, is a world-beating success, and that mass adoration and cold hard cash will be theirs. And that they find the right way to soothe the turmoil in their sarcastic, artistic, political, absolutely nutted, still homeless souls.

2/15/2022,"Singapore has been urged to halt the scheduled execution of two men convicted of a drug trafficking offence, with campaigners describing the plans as cruel and inhumane. Roslan bin Bakar and Pausi bin Jefridin, who were arrested in 2008, are due to be executed as early as Wednesday. Campaigners have raised numerous concerns about the handling of their cases, and say that Pausi, a Malaysian national, has an IQ of 67, and so should be protected under international law.  Singapore has some of the world’s harshest drugs laws, and its application of the death penalty has drawn increased international scrutiny. Pausi’s case has drawn comparisons with that of Nagaenthran K Dharmalingam, a Malaysian man with learning difficulties who was sentenced to the death penalty for smuggling a small amount of heroin. He was told he would face execution in November 2021, prompting an international outcry from UN experts and international rights groups. At the time Singapore’s high court maintained that Nagaenthran had been accorded due process in line with the law. Nagaenthran was later given an indefinite stay of execution after testing positive for Covid. Roslan bin Bakar and Pausi bin Jefridin were found guilty of trafficking 96.07 grams of diamorphine and 76.37 grams of methamphetamine, according to Transformative Justice Collective, which campaigns for reform of Singapore’s criminal justice system and provides support to people on death row. Roslan’s lawyer also argued that he had reduced intellectual functioning, according to TJC, though his IQ was not mentioned in the court judgment. Malaysian group Lawyers for Liberty said Singapore was ignoring its international obligations. “Imposing the death penalty on persons with mental disability is contrary to customary international law, inhumane and sickening. Both international law and the Singapore constitution prohibits the execution of anyone who suffers from a mental disorder,” the group said in a statement. Amnesty International said the executions, if they proceed, would be the first to be carried out in more than two years in Singapore. Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Amnesty International’s Singapore researcher, said: “It is appalling that the Singapore government is planning to resume this cruel practice imminently. Executing individuals who have been sentenced for drug related offences and to the mandatory death penalty is in breach of restrictions under international law.” “It is high time for Singapore to re-establish a moratorium on the death penalty as a first step towards full abolition. The global trend towards abolition continues unabated, with the majority of the world’s governments having abolished the cruel punishment in law or in practice.”",News/World news,Singapore urged to halt two executions over disability concerns,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/singapore-urged-to-halt-two-executions-over-disability-concerns
2/15/2022,"Hong Kong has turned newly built public housing and 10,000 hotel rooms into quarantine accommodation as authorities strive to control an Omicron outbreak that has overwhelmed the city. Recent days have seen record daily highs of more than 2,000 cases, but experts have warned the outbreak could reach about 30,000 a day. Already hospitals, testing facilities, and isolation centres have been swamped, with local media publishing photos of spillover tents set up in hospital carparks.  Thousands of people infected with Covid-19 are on a waiting list for isolation rooms, with another 5,400 preliminary positive cases reported on Tuesday morning. The move to repurpose social housing in Fanling and Kwai Chung will accommodate more than 3,000 people, chief executive Carrie Lam said. It mirrors a decision in February 2020 to convert a newly built block in Sha Tin, reversing a pledge not to repurpose the sought-after public housing and sparking small protests. The hotel rooms were not yet identified, and Lam warned she had emergency legal powers to compel hotels if not enough were cooperating.

Although the city’s fifth wave of infection had “outgrown our capacity”, Lam said the government remained committed to fully containing the outbreak, in contrast to many other countries which have since abandoned “zero Covid” strategies after being hit by the highly transmissible Omicron variant. “It is not an option to surrender to the virus,” Lam said. Last week the government ended its policy of sending all diagnosed cases to hospital for isolation, opening rooms at Penny’s Bay quarantine facility for mild or asymptomatic people to recover. To address a backlog of PCR tests created by mandatory testing orders which sent hundreds of thousands of residents to hours-long queues, Lam also announced authorities would start handing out 100m rapid testing kits on Tuesday, beginning with staff at aged care homes. The government has established taskforces to work with their mainland counterparts after China’s central government offered the city help with its outbreak. The new taskforces will focus on epidemiology, boosting testing capacity, ensuring medical and food supplies, and building isolation and treatment facilities. Hong Kong has produced one of the world’s most effective responses during the pandemic, but has been criticised over both its inconsistency and harshness, and even sparked a rare protest on Tuesday. The city is once again under tough social restrictions not seen since mid 2020, with near-daily additions or alterations. Vaccination rates remain comparatively low, especially among the elderly demographics, and there is little government transparency about the proportion of different vaccines used amid concerns over the effectiveness of the Chinese-developed Sinovac. Less than 15% of the adult population has received a booster short.",News/World news,Hong Kong turns public housing into Covid quarantine facilities as it battles Omicron surge,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/15/hong-kong-turns-public-housing-into-covid-quarantine-facilities-as-it-battles-omicron-surge
