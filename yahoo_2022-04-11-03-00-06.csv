4/11/2022,"When Ian Atherton traveled across the pond from his home in Fleetwood, England to Florida's Space Coast for an April vacation, one of the things he had on his bucket list was to catch a shark. He had always envisioned what it would be like to tangle man-to-fish with one of the ocean's most fearsome apex predators. How's that saying go about best laid plans? Atherton was able to catch and release a giant seagoing fish, only it wasn't a shark, but a distant cousin and something much rarer — and some might say cooler — than a shark. Mysterious catch: What kind of sea monster was caught near the Kennedy Space Center? Mystery meat: Endangered shark meat in some pet food? One study says yes, calls for clearer labeling Ground zero: Brevard County remains epicenter of manatee die-off Atherton joined Capt. Jon Cangianella of Fin & Fly charters in Cocoa Beach April 9 for a morning half-day to begin with shark fishing, then to try to catch some of the other popular fishing targets in the nearshore waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Cangianella steered Atherton out from Port Canaveral to a spot in about 35 feet of water a few miles from the inlet. He deployed a chunk of bluefish, an oily fish which draws in sharks from a large distance once the scent of the fish gets into the ocean's currents. Soon, there was a bite. Right away, line began peeling off the reel — not fast, but steady and strong. Atherton reeled tight to set the hook and began his battle on rod and reel. The tug of war went on for about an hour. As the fish drew close to the boat, Cangianella knew what Atherton had might not be a shark after all. The rostrum, or saw, came out of the water. It resembles a hedge trimmer and on a large sawfish it can measure up to 4 or 5 feet in length. The fish uses it in the wild by swinging it back and forth through a school of small baitfish. A whack from the saw will stun a small fish allowing the sawfish to pick it up from the bottom since it mouth is located on the underside of the large fish. They also eat crustaceans and other bottom dwelling organisms. The sawfish is actually very closely related to stingrays, not so much sharks, but is sometimes caught using the same methods. They inhabit Florida waters, but their population numbers in the wild are a mere fraction of what their numbers were before pioneer families 120 years ago began fishing coastal waters with nets. Cangianella freed the sawfish from its hook without removing it from the water, and the sawfish swam off healthy and strong. After the unique encounter, they set out for another spot with different bait where Atherton landed a few king mackerel. Unfortunately, his dream of catching a shark wasn't completed. However, he could have never imagined he would catch something so rare and mysterious as a sawfish. Another skipper with Fin & Fly charters, Capt. Parker Miley steered a Wisconsin family to a sawfish catch in the same area in August 2021. Another angler in 2021 encountered a healthy sawfish in the Indian River Lagoon in Brevard County. Smalltooth sawfish can grow to about 16 feet long. They are one of five sawfish species worldwide and the only sawfish species found in Florida waters. Historically, the species was found along the U.S. East Coast and throughout the Gulf of Mexico, including the waters of the Indian River Lagoon, Charlotte Harbor and the Everglades. But sawfish become easily entangled in fishing nets used by commercial fishers seeking other targeted species. Since the early 1900s, sawfish populations have declined dramatically. Sadly, they became the first marine fish species listed as endangered in 2003 under the U.S. Endangered Species Act. For more information about ongoing sawfish research and recovery efforts in Florida, visit FWC Sawfish and the Sawfish Recovery webpage at sawfishrecovery.org. To report sawfish sightings, call the Sawfish Hotline: 1-844-4SAWFISH, fill out an online report form at floridamuseum.ufl.edu/sawfish/report-encounter or email sawfish@myfwc.com. All sawfish caught in U.S. waters must be released unharmed immediately, or face federal charges. Keep sawfish in the water at all times. If it can be done safely, untangle the line if it is wrapped around the saw and remove as much of the line as possible. Cut the line as close to the hook as possible. Do not handle the animal or attempt to remove any hooks on the saw unless you have a long-handled de-hooker. Do not remove the rostrum, or saw.

4/11/2022,"Jerry Springer said the guests on his famous talk show were ""exactly"" like former President Donald Trump. Like Trump, guests would ""curse and yell"" because they lacked the skills to ""settle things in different ways."" The difference, Springer added, is that none of his guests had the ""delusion"" to run for president. Legendary talk show host Jerry Springer said on Thursday that the argumentative and out-of-control guests who appeared on his long-running show closely resemble former President Donald Trump, Newsweek reported. Speaking on SiriusXM's ""The Dean Obeidallah Show,"" Springer argued that ""there's no question"" the infamous bickering and cursing of guests on the famed ""The Jerry Springer Show"" led to Trump's election. ""The behavior of some of the people on the show is exactly Donald Trump,"" the talk show host explained to Obeidallah but he added, ""they have enough sense not to run for president."" Describing guests who appeared on his show, which sometimes featured physical fights, Springer said they would ""curse and yell and sometimes fight because they don't have the skills to settle things in different ways."" That, Springer said, is just like Trump. ""But what made Trump unique, the only thing that separates him from the guests on my show is the fact that he had this delusion he knew how to run the world and run the country when, in fact, he knows nothing about how you run a country,"" Springer added. The Jerry Springer Show ended in 2018. Since then, Springer, a Democrat, has spoken out numerous times about his dislike of the former president. ""The thing that annoys me about Trump is that he took my show and brought it to the White House,"" Springer said in September 2019. In November of that year, he said that Trump uses ""language even on our crazy show we'd bleep out.""

4/11/2022,"Late Saturday evening, former President Donald Trump officially endorsed his old TV pal Dr. Mehmet Oz in the ruckus Republican U.S. Senate primary race in Pennsylvania. In doing so, Trump, while speaking at a rally in North Carolina, ignited fury and ridicule among some of the loudest voices in Trumpworld. At issue among Trump’s most fervent supporters is the belief that Oz, a Turkish-American TV physician who has hobnobbed with Hollywood’s elite and has flip-flopped on the issue of abortion, isn’t a trustworthy “America First” Republican candidate, compared to fellow candidate Dave McCormick, who has ex-Trump administration officials Hope Hicks and Stephen Miller by his side. “I have enormous respect for President Trump. I was honored to have his endorsement in PA. Twice,” Sean Parnell, the former Trump-backed candidate, who dropped out of the race after an abuse allegation surfaced from his estranged ex-wife, wrote on Twitter. “But I’m disappointed by this. Oz is the antithesis of everything that made Trump the best president of my lifetime.” Dr. Oz’s Sick Journey From Political Joke to Senate Candidate The infighting only intensified as more conservative commentators and politicos lined up to take shots at Trump’s endorsement. “It’s like Donald Trump’s staff is sabotaging Trump by convincing him to make the worst possible endorsements,” conservative radio host Erick Erickson tweeted. “This endorsement could divide MAGA in the only way that matters: he could lose America First conservatives over it,” Breitbart News’ Joel Pollak wrote. Elsewhere, Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL), who is running for the Senate and who has split with Trump in recent over back-and-forth accusations of election interference, chalked up the Oz endorsement to weak-kneaded staffers the ex-president has enlisted. “This is happening because Trump’s surrounded himself by staff who are on McConnell’s payroll & hostile to the MAGA agenda. Everybody telling Trump who to endorse in primaries works for The Swamp,” said Brooks, whose Trump endorsement was recently rescinded. “They played him. Again.” But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) didn’t immediately jump in on the backing Oz during an interview on Fox News Sunday, stating, “I think we’re in a good position to win that race regardless of who the nominee is.” Inside Dr. Oz’s Shameless Flip-Flop on Abortion Longtime Republican operative Roger Stone couldn’t help joining the pile-on either, writing on Telegram, “Wait? President [Trump] endorsed this guy?” while attaching a photo of the doctor, who rose to infamy after years of hosting a daytime television show with guests like Michelle Obama. Lesser-known pro-Trump media personalities also stepped into the fold, including Townhall columnist Kurt Schlichter, who wrote: “It’s pretty hard for me to fully express how disappointed in Trump I am for endorsing Oz.” “Wait. Is there anything conservative about Dr. Oz?” Blaze TV’s Allie Beth Stuckey added. While the likes of far-right radio host Stew Peters continue to take nightly jabs at Oz, the doctor has an ally in Fox News host Sean Hannity. “I am supporting his nomination to be the Republican candidate,” Hannity said in March. “I have known him for many, many years.” Read more at The Daily Beast.

4/11/2022,"By Jonathan Landay and Gibran Naiyyar Peshimam WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan was ousted from office in a no-confidence vote in parliament in the early hours of Sunday after three years and seven months in power. A new government will be formed most likely under opposition leader Shehbaz Sharif, after parliament reconvenes on Monday to vote for a new prime minister. The nation of more than 220 million people lies between Afghanistan to the west, China to the northeast and India to the east, making it of vital strategic importance. Since coming to power in 2018, Khan's rhetoric has become more anti-American, and he expressed a desire to move closer to China and, recently, Russia -- including talks with President Vladimir Putin on Feb. 24, the day the invasion of Ukraine began. At the same time, U.S. and Asian foreign policy experts said that Pakistan's powerful military has traditionally controlled foreign and defence policy, but Khan's sharp public rhetoric had an impact on a number of key relationships. Here is what the upheaval, which comes as the economy is in deep trouble, means for countries closely involved in Pakistan: AFGHANISTAN Ties between Pakistan's military intelligence agency and the Islamist militant Taliban have loosened in recent years. Now that the Taliban are back in power in Afghanistan, and facing an economic and humanitarian crisis due to a lack of money and international isolation, Qatar is arguably their most important foreign partner. ""We (the United States) don't need Pakistan as a conduit to the Taliban. Qatar is definitely playing that role now,"" said Lisa Curtis, director of the Indo-Pacific Security Program at the Center for a New American Security think-tank. Tensions have risen between the Taliban and Pakistan's military, which has lost several soldiers in attacks close to their mutual border. Pakistan wants the Taliban to do more to crack down on extremist groups and worries they will spread violence into Pakistan. That has begun to happen already. Khan had been less critical of the Taliban over human rights than most foreign leaders. CHINA Khan consistently emphasised China's positive role in Pakistan and in the world at large. At the same time, the $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which binds the neighbours together was actually conceptualised and launched under Pakistan's two established political parties, both of which are set to share power in the new government. Potential successor Sharif, the younger brother of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, struck deals with China directly as leader of the eastern province of Punjab, and his reputation for getting major infrastructure projects off the ground while avoiding political grandstanding could in fact be music to Beijing's ears. INDIA The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought three wars since independence in 1947, two of them over the disputed Muslim-majority territory of Kashmir. As with Afghanistan, it is Pakistan's military that controls policy in the sensitive area, and tensions along the de facto border there are at their lowest level since 2021, thanks to a ceasefire. But there have been no formal diplomatic talks between the rivals for years because of deep distrust over a range of issues, including Khan's extreme criticism of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his handling of attacks on minority Muslims in India. Karan Thapar, an Indian political commentator who has closely followed India-Pakistan ties, said the Pakistani military could put pressure on the new government in Islamabad to build on the successful ceasefire in Kashmir. Pakistan's powerful army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa said recently that his country was ready to move forward on Kashmir if India agrees. The Sharif dynasty has been at the forefront of several dovish overtures towards India over the years. UNITED STATES U.S.-based South Asia experts said that Pakistan's political crisis is unlikely to be a priority for President Joe Biden, who is grappling with the war in Ukraine, unless it led to mass unrest or rising tensions with India. ""We have so many other fish to fry,"" said Robin Raphel, a former assistant secretary of state for South Asia who is a senior associate with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. With the Pakistani military maintaining its behind-the-scenes control of foreign and security policies, the change of government was not a major concern, according to some analysts. ""Since it's the military that calls the shots on the policies that the U.S. really cares about, i.e. Afghanistan, India and nuclear weapons, internal Pakistani political developments are largely irrelevant for the U.S.,"" said Curtis, who served as then-U.S. President Donald Trump's National Security Council senior director for South Asia. She added that Khan's visit to Moscow had been a ""disaster"" in terms of U.S. relations, and that a new government in Islamabad could at least help mend ties ""to some degree"". Khan has blamed the United States for the current political crisis, saying that Washington wanted him removed because of the recent Moscow trip. Washington denies any role.
