2/14/2022,"Two generations are claiming the Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show ― and some are getting just a touch testy over it. The show featured instantly iconic performances from Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Kendrick Lamar, Mary J. Blige, Eminem and 50 Cent. But it was a tweet about the event by NBC News that may have inadvertently kicked off an intergenerational feud as the network declared: “Super Bowl Halftime Show taps into millennial nostalgia.” Millennials cheered, while Gen Xers (as apathetically as possible, of course) stepped in to contest the claim. Each side has a solid argument. All of the key performers except for Lamar are Gen Xers by age, but the bulk of the songs played were big hits during the formative years for many Millennials. That led to some (mostly) good-natured discussions and jokes over which generation was best represented by the performance: Ya'll really keep forgetting that we exist. It's Gen X. https://t.co/1oZTMsRloj — Shay Stewart Bouley (@blackgirlinmain) February 14, 2022 The halftime show is for Millennials. And after everything we’ve endured in this nation, we deserve this. — Anthony Michael Kreis (@AnthonyMKreis) February 14, 2022 Gen X and maybe older millennials like me, but definitely Gen X. https://t.co/T91YsRhdzg — Ilhan Omar (@IlhanMN) February 14, 2022 Gen X having a wee meltdown over this headline. Most of the songs came out around 2000 and we were listenting to it all through middle/high school

I don't think Xers were hyped watching Mary J and her wigs over summer break the same way we were https://t.co/qqu8g5MmLppic.twitter.com/lgvBWa6SPr — Timo 22 (@terkswerks) February 14, 2022 Dr Dre - 56

That’s a GenX halftime show. Sorry boomers and millennials, you aren’t taking this from us too 😂 all right — Seton O'Connor (@HiMyNameIsSeton) February 14, 2022 Boomers taking all the money. Millennials taking all the credit. #GenXLife — Seton O'Connor (@HiMyNameIsSeton) February 14, 2022 This halftime show was made in a lab for elder millennials and I love it — Ashley Gold (@ashleyrgold) February 14, 2022 Millennials? That was for Gen X! pic.twitter.com/6cMokEEe39 — Melissa Murray (@ProfMMurray) February 14, 2022 ban Gen X from online permanently pic.twitter.com/FuVDdDyo3D — Lena (@banalplay) February 14, 2022 Millennials are really trying to claim Doctor Dre and Snoop and no, that is Gen X, The Chronic came out in 1992 when you were like eight. No.
Doggystyle was 1993.
Watching Old School in high school doesn’t count.

Period. Don’t even argue. A trip down memory lane when gen x’ers were clubbing and running free. Now our back hurts, our kids occasionally test us, and we see the mailman and we think bills. #SuperBowl — Will Tran (@KRON4WTran) February 14, 2022 Gen X gets absolutely no recognition.

2/14/2022,"China should relax its dual citizenship restrictions, a Beijing-based demographer has said, as controversy swirls over the nationality of Winter Olympics gold medallist Eileen Gu's nationality. Olympic athletes must be citizens of the nations under whose flag they compete. But US-born Gu, 18, has chosen to represent China - her mother's country. She continues to decline to disclose the status of her own citizenship, which has made many on social media turn against the champion freestyle skier. But all ambiguities could be resolved if China were to remove the article in its nationality law that rejects dual citizenship, according to Huang Wenzheng, a population expert at a Beijing-based think tank.

Ifwereis proposal is adopted, ""Gu Ailing's Chinese nationality issue will not have any legal obstacles ad, ambiguities,"" Huang said, referring to Gu by her Chinese name in an article posted on the WeChat account of the Centre for China and Globalisation. Huang, a senior researcher at centre who had first raised this proposal six years ago, also called on authorities to prioritise recognising the Chinese origins of overseas residents with foreign citizenship - not only to attract more talent from abroad but also to ease China's demographic crisis. China's nationality law - enacted in 1980 - stipulates that anyone acquiring foreign citizenship would automatically lose their Chinese nationality. The law was ""not in keeping with the times"", Huang wrote, as the country's ""economic and social situation has undergone tremendous changes, and the depth and frequency of exchanges with foreign personnel have long been different."" The current rules only set up obstacles for overseas talent to go back and serve their motherland, he said. In addition, Huang said attracting overseas Chinese to return would help ease the country's serious population crisis, with the growth rate at a six-decade low. Well before Gu decided to compete for China in 2019, she had come to be regarded as a skiing star, and was the face of many top brands. But with neither the Chinese nor the US government providing official information on her citizenship, conflicting information continues to swirl. Eileen Gu with her mother, Gu Yan. Photo: Weibo alt=Eileen Gu with her mother, Gu Yan. Photo: Weibo> The controversy has taken on an added dimension at a time of growing US-China geopolitical rivalry. However, Chinese holding dual nationality should not enjoy political rights such as voting in China, he said. Huang also noted that most countries, especially in the developed world, generally accepted multiple nationalities. Citing laws of Israel that support multiple citizenships, Huang said they helped strengthen the global Jewish sense of belonging to Israel, whereas India also issues ""Person of Indian Origin"" cards valid for Indians abroad, and their spouses and descendants. The amendment of the law was an urgent matter, Huang said, citing the increasing number of Chinese going overseas, coupled with the further globalisation of the country's economy and expansion of its cross-continental Belt and Road Initiative. ""More and more Chinese will face the difficulty of choosing their nationality,"" Huang said. ""Therefore, it is time to amend the nationality law and change outdated provisions.""
