5/10/2022,"The Washington Post has won the 2022 Pulitzer prize for public service journalism, for The Attack, its account of the deadly assault on the US Capitol by supporters of Donald Trump on 6 January 2021. The paper beat two other finalists: the New York Times, for challenging official accounts of US military engagements in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, for an exposé of electrical fires in city rental operations. The Pulitzers, administered by Columbia University in New York and considered the most prestigious prizes in US journalism, recognise work in 15 journalism categories and seven arts categories. The winner of the public service award receives a gold medal. Winners of other categories get $15,000. A bipartisan Senate committee linked seven deaths to the assault on the Capitol, which happened after Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” to overturn his election defeat by Joe Biden. The attack did not succeed in stopping certification of Biden’s victory. Trump was impeached for inciting an insurrection. The impeachment was the most bipartisan ever but the former president was acquitted when enough Senate Republicans stayed loyal. Trump therefore remains free to run for the White House again. A House committee is preparing for public hearings in its investigation of the riot, which has produced a charge of criminal contempt of Congress against Steve Bannon, Trump’s former chief strategist. Bannon has pleaded not guilty. More than 800 people have been charged over the Capitol attack, some, members of a far-right militia, with seditious conspiracy. Announcing the prize, the administrator of the Pulitzer prizes, Marjorie Miller, saluted the Post for its “compellingly told and vividly presented account of the assault on Washington … providing the public with a thorough understanding of one of the nation’s darkest days”. Sally Buzzbee, executive editor of the Post, said: “There is nothing more central to the American experiment than democracy … in 2021, that democracy came under attack from within. “The challenge for the fourth estate was clear: we were no longer just a watchdog of the institutions and elected leaders of our democracy, but an indispensable defender of democracy itself.” Buzzbee also saluted “more than 100” of her journalists for “fearless, consistent and comprehensive work … read and watched by millions [and] cited in congressional investigations”. The intersection of health, safety and infrastructure played a prominent role among other winning projects. The Tampa Bay Times won the investigative reporting award for Poisoned, an in-depth look into a polluting lead factory. The paper’s editor and vice-president, Mark Katches, said the win was “a testament to the importance of a vital local newsroom like the Times”. The Miami Herald took the breaking news award for its work covering the deadly Surfside condo tower collapse, while the Better Government Association and the Chicago Tribune won the local reporting award for Deadly Fires, Broken Promises, an examination of a lack of enforcement of fire safety standards. The Miami Herald’s executive editor, Monica Richardson, said: “As a newsroom, we poured our hearts into the breaking news and the ongoing daily coverage, and subsequent investigative coverage, of the Champlain Towers South condominium collapse story. “It was our story to tell because the people and the families in Surfside who were impacted by this unthinkable tragedy are a part of our community.” The Pulitzer prizes also awarded a special citation to journalists from Ukraine, acknowledging their “courage, endurance and commitment” in covering the Russian invasion. Last August, the Pulitzer board granted a special citation to Afghan journalists who help produce news and images from their own war-torn country.",News/Media,Washington Post wins public service Pulitzer for Capitol attack coverage,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/09/washington-post-pulitzer-prize-2022-capitol-attack-coverage
5/10/2022,"Spike, the quarrelsome dachshund, got something every meal, even as the humans trapped in the bunker under Azovstal steelworks were wasting away from hunger. By the end there was so little food and water that adults were eating one tiny meal a day. Two cups of macaroni went into 10 litres of water, and that ‘soup’ had to feed 30 people. The children ate twice. Still, they all shared food with their pet. “Someone would give him a spoon of porridge and everyone in the family would give him three or four spoons when they ate. Luckily he is small,” said Olena Chekhonatski. She fled underground to escape shelling at the start of the war with her husband, Yegor, and two sons, 12-year-old Artem and 17-year-old Dmitry. They expected to stay perhaps two weeks, but only emerged two months later. “I was never a dog person before Spike arrived,” she said with a rueful glance at the dog she starved herself to keep alive, as he bounded along the sandy shore of the Dnieper river, on the family’s first day of freedom since late February. The family were in the very last group of civilians officially evacuated from Azovstal, arriving in Ukrainian-held territory on the evening before Putin declared his war as a “sacred” mission to liberate people like their family, at a military parade in Moscow. “What liberation? What was the reason for all that?” Olena asked. “Our first feeling is disbelief we made it out. The last days we were losing hope, the shelling was so heavy it seemed impossible to get out,” Yegor added. The family thought in March that they might be in the bunker for two weeks. Others they sheltered with had prepared for two days. More than two months later, they were still there, supplies of food and water dwindling as the buildings above them were ripped apart by Russian bombs. They had been deprived of almost everything except sleep. “Sleep more eat less. Because when you are asleep you don’t need to eat,” Yegor said. “The plan now is to keep on living, the rest will follow.” When they moved in there was electricity, but their world rapidly shrank in the mouldy basement, its dank smell seeping into their clothes and skin. The electricity was cut off after a day, and there was no internet, just a small radio that could pick up some longwave transmissions. They used car batteries to power LED lights, and in the gloom tried to make the hours pass with games. They had brought chess, backgammon and cards, and someone made a Mariupol monopoly set, with the city’s industrial plants and malls replacing the glitzy shopping streets of London. They can laugh about some things now. They foraged for food in the remains of a warehouse that had been bombed by the Russians, and one day Yegor went with two older men, who insisted on joining them despite failing strength and eyesight. One came back with coffee beans he had mistaken for small pasta shapes, and a giant bag of bay leaves. Neither helped with hunger but they decided to crush the coffee with a hammer. “I should say it was a great cup of coffee,” he said. But every day was a gamble with death. Even a trip to the toilet meant risking their lives, because the latrines were on the ground floor. For children, old and disabled people there were buckets in the shelter, which the adults took turns emptying. “No one came out of there unchanged,” said Oksana, an Azovstal employee who asked not to give her full name for security reasons. “They were one person when they went in, and another person when they came out.” In the early days the children were obviously traumatised, she said. The teenagers spent hours staring at the walls, the younger children shied away from touch, and when she encouraged them to draw they avoided the coloured pens and would do pictures only in black. Over time they adjusted a little to their terrifying new existence. “Later they let us hug them, especially during the bombing. They made friends, and the older kids taught the younger kids, there was a four-year-old who could barely read the alphabet when they arrived but by the end he could do maths and read and write well.” Oksana herself has emerged with three talismans from this descent into horror. Her husband’s teaspoon, from his work canteen. Drawings by the children she guided through this time. And a passport cover with gleaming beadwork she did herself, the only piece of her work she has left from a favourite hobby. “I have nothing else from home.” They tried to leave when a ‘green corridor’ was announced in early March but were driven back underground by fighting. They had watched dozens of people leave before them, including residents of a neighbouring bunker that ran out of food weeks before they did, but each trip was a gamble. “When the children went outside, we made tags on their clothes with their names, blood types and date of birth. So at least if they were killed it would be easier to identify the bodies,” Oksana said. One group decided to hike the 100km to Berdyansk, through battlefields, minefields and ruins, because that seemed less terrifying than staying at the plant. “We don’t know if they made it.” Then they heard about the final attempts to set up civilian rescue corridors on the radio and decided to see if they could find a way out. Soldiers found them waiting outside, and said they had 15 minutes to get ready. They worry that there may be other desperate civilians trapped under the plant, who didn’t have radios to learn about the evacuation, or weren’t found by the soldiers. At a Russian “filtration” camp, where evacuees are searched by authorities, the Chekhonatski family met a teenager who had spent the whole war hiding in a basement a few dozen meters from theirs with two other men. They had no idea he was there. They also worry about the troops who got them out, through the ruined complex. “Not even heroes, I don’t know how to describe it, there’s no word to express all our gratitude for what they’ve done for us,” Yegor said. “I beg God, I hope some miracle happens and they make it out of there alive.” Oksana was overwhelmed, when she was finally able to charge her phone and turn it on after two months, to find a flood of messages from family, relatives and friends from across Ukraine and around the world. Many were the beneficiaries of a charity where she worked, that provided food and other aid to families with young children. “I never imagined I would be the one needing help.” Artem Mazhulin contributed reporting",News/World news,‘What liberation?’: Mariupol survivors rescued from last civilian bunker describe horrors of siege ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/what-liberation-mariupol-survivors-rescued-from-last-bunker-describe-horrors-of-siege

5/10/2022,"Scores of inmates are feared dead in Ecuador after a deadly prison riot broke out between rival drugs gangs, in the latest bloody episode of a wave of violence that has engulfed the country’s prisons. Forty-three prisoners were confirmed dead on Monday as more than 200 police commandos retook control of the maximum-security wing of the Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas prison, about two hours drive from the capital Quito, but the death-toll is likely to rise. Interior minister Patricio Carrillo told reporters that the majority of the victims had been “executed with bladed weapons”. It is Ecuador’s sixth deadly prison massacre since the beginning of 2021 pushing the death toll to nearly 400 as violence has spiked to unprecedented levels fuelled by rivalry between drug trafficking gangs. More than 300 inmates were slaughtered in the country’s prisons last year, including one massacre in Guayaquil’s Litoral penitentiary in which 119 prisoners lost their lives. Gruesome images on social media showed mutilated bodies strewn in a courtyard in the jail. Meanwhile, local television broadcast images which have become all too familiar to Ecuadorean viewers, showing dozens of relatives, mostly women, who had gathered outside the jail desperate for news of their loved ones. “There was really a lot of cruelty,” Ecuador’s police chief, Fausto Salinas, told journalists, adding that hand grenades, machine guns, revolvers and ammunition had been found at the jail. Earlier on Monday, he told local television that the immediate trigger for the violence was the transfer of a gang leader from another prison. “The presence of this person generated conflict and violence,” he said, criticising the judicial authorities who ordered the transfer. This latest massacre is the first large-scale violent incident in the Santo Domingo prison this year. In February 2021, 33 inmates were killed in the same prison, many of them decapitated and dismembered, as part of a simultaneous attack coordinated by criminal gangs in different prisons that left a total of 78 dead throughout the country. Analysts say the spike in prison violence began when local criminal gangs began vying to work with the rival Mexican Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation drug cartels. Ecuador – which sits between Colombia and Peru, the world’s two largest cocaine-producing countries – is a strategic smuggling route due to its long Pacific coastline and large shipping and fishing fleets. In the first four months of this year, Ecuadorean authorities have seized 85 tonnes of cocaine, twice the amount seized the year before. Ecuador’s president Guillermo Lasso, who was on an official visit to Israel, expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and said: “This is the unfortunate result of gang violence” in a tweet.",News/World news,Ecuador prison riot leaves 43 dead in latest bloody episode ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/ecuador-prison-riot-leaves-scores-dead
5/10/2022,"The first group of people will be informed this week of the government’s intention to send them to Rwanda under its controversial relocation scheme, the Home Office has said. Under plans announced last month, people arriving illegally in the UK via Channel crossings and other routes will be detained and sent to the east African nation to apply for asylum there. The government has said it expects tens of thousand of people to be relocated under the scheme, although the plans face legal challenges from charities and campaign groups. The Home Office has said that people who arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel will be among the first group notified that it plans to send them to Rwanda. It added that it expects the first flights to take place in the coming months. In a statement, the home secretary, Priti Patel, said: “Britain’s asylum system is broken as criminals exploit and smuggle people into our country at huge costs to UK taxpayers. “The world-leading migration partnership with Rwanda means those making dangerous, unnecessary and illegal journeys to the UK may be relocated to Rwanda to have their claims for asylum considered and to rebuild their lives there, helping break the people-smugglers’ business model and prevent loss of life. “This is just the first stage of the process and we know it will take time as some will seek to frustrate the process and delay removals. I will not be deterred from acting to deliver on the changes the British people voted for to take back control of our money, laws and borders.” Last week saw the first legal action against the scheme get under way. The challenge, brought by law firm InstaLaw, states that the proposals run contrary to international law and the UN refugee convention, as well as breaching British data protection law. The case focuses on an Iranian asylum seeker who believes he would face an extremely difficult time if sent to Rwanda. On Friday, a speech by Patel at a Conservative party dinner was disrupted by a group of pro-refugee campaigners. Shortly after Patel began to speak, eight activists from the Green New Deal Rising stood up one by one and called on her to drop the scheme, calling it “racist” and “inhumane”. Responding to Monday’s announcement, Enver Solomon, CEO of the Refugee Council, said: “The government’s desire to treat people as human cargo and expel them to Rwanda is not only cruel, nasty and unprincipled, but it is also completely unworkable and lacking key details. Given this, it isn’t surprising it is facing legal challenges. “Rather than pushing ahead with a harmful policy that destroys our reputation as a country which values human rights, this government must focus on operating an orderly, humane and fair asylum system, and developing safe routes such as humanitarian visas.”",News/UK news,First refugees to be told this week of their relocation to Rwanda,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/09/first-refugees-to-be-toldd-this-week-of-their-relocation-to-rwanda
