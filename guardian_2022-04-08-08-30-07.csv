4/8/2022,"The whiff of abnormality prevailed at Augusta National on Thursday morning. An epic overnight storm – during which thunder cracked over Augusta for hours on end – led to a delay in play getting under way. This venue’s famous azaleas are not in full bloom, the consequence of previous weather issues. Gary Player had already caused red faces among Green Jackets by donning a Saudi Arabian advertising logo for honorary starting duties by the time the South African offered an obscure perspective on the merits of India. “I love India, the intelligence, the technology, the manners,” Player said. “The women dress so nicely. I’m so used to seeing women with damn dresses up their bum and you don’t see anything like that in India.” Where to begin. Thankfully, a semblance of natural order soon appeared. Tiger Woods rolled back the years and commanded the cheers. Cameron Smith, seeking to become the only player other than Woods to claim the Players Championship and Masters in the same year, again proved his Augusta specialism. Dustin Johnson, the 2020 champion, used the afternoon to maraud through the field. Scottie Scheffler, golf’s hottest property on account of three wins since February, moved to within touching distance of the lead. We have a major on our hands, which should soon render the elements and Player’s strange antics an irrelevance. Woods is the name on everybody’s lips. Twas ever thus. He played perfectly controlled golf for six holes – at which point he was one under – before a wayward tee shot at the 7th. Woods duly saved par, thanks to a wonderful chip. He cut a frustrated figure after a wasteful dropped shot at par five eighth and was again agitated following a pulled drive at the tricky 9th. Was the fairytale to prove short lived? No chance; birdies at the 13th and 16th – he converted from 29ft there – contributed to a day’s work under par. No wonder Woods could barely keep the smile from his face as he strode from the final green. Smith’s round of 68 was remarkable in that it included double bogeys at the 1st and 18th with eight birdies in between. This is the Australian’s first appearance since winning at Sawgrass last month. Despite his competitive nature, he was fully onboard with the Woods hype from the group in front. “I actually found myself a couple of times today, because we were waiting so much, just watching him,” Smith said. “I almost felt like a patron out there at some points today. You can’t not watch him; he’s unreal.” Scheffler also came unstuck at the last but only by way of a bogey. “I think it’s a really special honour and something that can’t ever be taken away from me, being No 1 in the world, but at the end of the day it doesn’t give me any strokes on the field this week,” Scheffler said. His 69 was matched by Danny Willett, who is looking to end a dismal Augusta run since donning the Green Jacket in 2016. Joaquin Niemann’s three under par is perhaps worthy of extra credit given it was done in the company of Woods. Johnson was unhappy with his 69, having dropped a shot with a three-putt at the penultimate hole. Im Sung-jae provides a Masters conundrum. He has played in this major just twice before, with a record that reads: tied second, missed cut. Im surged to the top of the leaderboard at five under par courtesy of a birdie at the 15th, thereby illustrating that he was summoning the spirit of 2020 rather than 2021. The Korean’s front half of 32 was the finest score of the day, in what were its most testing conditions. A whipping wind is set to be joined by plummeting temperatures as we enter rounds two, three and four. Im’s 67 headed the field at close of play. Paul Casey withdrew before striking a ball due to back spasms. A 76 for Bryson DeChambeau was no shock given ongoing injury battles but that Justin Thomas signed for an identical score raised eyebrows given his pre-tournament prominence. Sandy Lyle’s 82 only added to the sense that this could prove the 1988 champion’s final Masters hurrah. Woods was once spoken about in such terms; it is difficult to keep track of and deliver fresh descriptions for the comebacks. This one could yet be the finest.",Sport/Sport,The Masters: Cameron Smith’s clunky bookends mar superb opening chapter,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/08/the-masters-cameron-smith-first-round-danny-willett-tiger-woods
4/8/2022,"Customer service standards at UK energy providers have plummeted to their worst levels since 2017, coinciding with soaring bills, according to Citizens Advice. Days after households were hit with a record energy bill increase after the regulator lifted the price cap, the charity said its research had revealed a drop in customer service across the board, with many people facing long waits on the phone or for a reply to an email. Citizens Advice’s latest star rating table covers customer service between 1 October and 31 December 2021, when more than a dozen suppliers collapsed, including Bulb Energy, Pure Planet and Orbit Energy. In recent days many of the biggest energy firms have come under fire after their websites crashed as customers rushed to submit meter readings before the 1 April price hike took effect. Citizens Advice said that despite the backdrop of suppliers collapsing, it was concerned that its data was “part of a trend of declining standards at a time” when people particularly needed “support from their energy companies to cope with record bills and a cost of living crisis”. It added: “Energy suppliers’ customer service is the worst it’s been on average since 2017.” According to the updated table, even the best-performing suppliers are now scoring less than four out of five stars. Until last year, the best supplier had always scored more than four stars. It named the “worst-performing” firms as Utilita, Boost, Ecotricity, Good Energy and Ovo. The lowest score among these dropped to 1.7 compared with 2.1 in the previous quarter. One of the main drivers of the low scores was the rise in call waiting times, said Citizens Advice. The average call waiting time is now more than five minutes, compared with about four minutes during the same period in 2020, though customers with some suppliers face wait times of about 15 minutes. Email response times have also become slightly worse. According to the latest ratings, the highest score is now 3.85 out of five. The five suppliers at the top of the table are M&S Energy, EDF, Octopus Energy, Affect Energy and So Energy. Dame Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “The drop in customer service standards comes at the worst time possible.” She added: “It’s Ofgem’s job to make sure companies are delivering a good service. But the current system isn’t working.” The charity compares suppliers’ customer service by looking at information from a number of sources, including complaints, billing and switching data.",News/Business,UK energy suppliers’ customer service at ‘worst’ level since 2017 ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/08/uk-energy-suppliers-customer-service-at-worst-level-since-2017-citizens-advice-plummeting-standards
4/8/2022,"A health watchdog is urging millions of people for the first time to ensure their waist size is less than half their height in order to help stave off serious health problems. The UK has one of the worst obesity rates in Europe, with two in three adults officially overweight or obese in an escalating crisis that now costs the NHS £6bn a year and wider society £27bn. The most widely used method to check if a person is a healthy weight is body mass index (BMI), which for most people can accurately measure whether they are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 is considered a healthy weight, 25 to 30 is overweight, and over 30 is obese. But amid increasing concerns over the toll of obesity on the health of the population in England and Wales, for the first time ever, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) will say on Friday that adults with a BMI under 35 should also measure their waist-to-height ratio to stay healthy. By using the ratio together with BMI, people can work out whether they are carrying excess fat around their middle, which is known to raise the risk of serious conditions, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease. Anyone wanting to find out their waist-to-height ratio can use an online calculator, or could ask a health professional to work it out for them. To measure their waist, they should find the bottom of their ribs and the top of their hips, wrap a tape measure around the waist midway between these points and breathe out naturally before taking the measurement. As an example, a 163cm (5ft 4in) female with a waist circumference of 74cm (29in) would have a healthy ratio, but 81cm would push her into the unhealthy range. A man who is 178cm (5ft 10in) would be at increased health risks if he had a 91cm (36in) waist. The guideline says a healthy waist to height ratio is 0.4 to 0.49, indicating no increased health risks. A ratio of 0.5 to 0.59 puts people at increased risk of health issues, while 0.6 or more puts them at the highest risk of health problems. Dr Paul Chrisp, the director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said: “Our updated draft guideline offers people a simple and effective way of measuring their weight so they can understand the factors that could impact on their health and take action to address them. “Our committee found that a clear benefit of using the waist-to-height ratio is that people can easily measure it themselves, interpret the results, and seek medical advice if they are at increased health risk.” The guidance also sets out ways to assess childhood obesity and says tailored plans should be considered for children with a high BMI or a waist-to-height ratio above 0.5. The guideline committee member Prof Rachel Batterham, a consultant in obesity, diabetes and endocrinology, said: “Increased fat in the abdomen increases a person’s risk of developing several life-limiting diseases including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. “Waist-to-height ratio is a simple, easy-to-use measure that identifies people who are at increased health risk and would benefit from weight management support to improve their health.”",News/Society,"Ensure waist size is less than half your height, health watchdog says",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/08/ensure-waist-size-is-less-than-half-your-height-health-watchdog-says
4/8/2022,"People could eventually be able to turn the clock back on the cell-ageing process by 30 years, according to researchers who have developed a technique for reprogramming skin cells to behave as if they are much younger. Research from the Babraham Institute, which is affiliated to the University of Cambridge, could lead to the development of techniques that will stave off the diseases of old age by restoring the function of older cells and reducing their biological age. In experiments simulating a skin wound, older cells were exposed to a concoction of chemicals that “reprogrammed” them to behave more like youthful cells and removed age-related changes. This has been previously achieved, but the new work was completed in a much a shorter time frame – 13 days compared with 50 – and made the cells even younger. Dr Diljeet Gill, a researcher at the Babraham Institute, said: “Our understanding of ageing on a molecular level has progressed over the last decade, giving rise to techniques that allow researchers to measure age-related biological changes in human cells. We were able to apply this to our experiment to determine the extent of reprogramming our new method achieved. “Our results represent a big step forward in our understanding of cell reprogramming.” The new method is based on the Nobel prize-winning technique scientists use – which is inspired by how old cells from parents are turned into the youthful tissues of a newborn – to make stem cells. These are a kind of biological “blank slate”, without the markers of ageing. The Babraham research represents a step forward because this technique does not completely erase the original cell. Instead, the reprogramming process is halted part way, enabling researchers to find a balance between making cells biologically younger while preserving their specialised cell function. The experiment showed promising signs that the rejuvenated cells would be better at healing wounds. The reprogrammed cells produced more collagen proteins, which help heal wounds, compared with cells that did not undergo the reprogramming process. The researchers also observed that their method had an encouraging effect on other genes linked to age-related diseases and symptoms. These included the APBA2 gene, which is associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and the MAF gene, which has a role in the development of cataracts. However, the researchers said the mechanism behind the reprogramming was not yet fully understood, since it could cause cancer, and must be further explored before the findings could be applied to regenerative medicine. How to reverse the ageing process is a scientific question that has attracted enormous attention and huge investment in recent years. Several of the researchers who worked on the Babraham Institute experiment have since left to join Altos Labs, a £2.2bn Silicon Valley billionaire-backed startup, which has signed numerous Nobel laureates to work on rejuvenating human cells in an attempt to prevent the diseases of old age that result in death.",News/Science,Scientists make further inroads into reversing ageing process of cells,https://www.theguardian.com/science/2022/apr/08/scientists-make-further-inroads-into-reversing-ageing-process-of-cells
4/8/2022,"The slightest flaw could help the other win the supposed title-decider at the Etihad and the absence of Rúben Dias will be a worry for Manchester City. John Stones will almost certainly replace him for Liverpool’s visit. He spent most of Tuesday night in Atlético Madrid’s half as City were not forced to defend against a side who failed to have a single shot at goal. Liverpool will be the polar opposite on Sunday and Stones, alongside Aymeric Laporte, will need to maintain concentration against the most prolific attack in the Premier League, who have seven more goals than City this season. Adapting to different styles is the beauty of flitting between domestic and European football but such a drastic change could be hard to adapt to, especially for someone like Stones whose concentration can lapse. Liverpool may target Stones as the pressure will be on him to replace City’s most consistent defender. There is no doubting he has the ability to keep Liverpool quiet but he will need to be at his focused best or Jürgen Klopp could be spending Monday buying silver polish. WU  Manchester City v Liverpool, Sunday 4.30pm (all times BST) Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/05-61553-gnl.fw.200505.jf.ch7DW.mp3 Manchester United have played more league games this season under Ralf Rangnick (16) than Ole Gunnar Solskjær (12). The pattern is clear: Rangnick loses fewer matches than Solskjær but draws more. And draws are no good to United now. They probably have to win seven of their final eight fixtures to stay in contention for the top four, and they’re in no sort of form. As Wayne Rooney said on Monday Night Football, the sharp end of the season demands experience. Rangnick needs to stop photocopying the team sheet and make better use of his resources – Nemanja Matic’s know-how, Jesse Lingard’s energy, Juan Mata’s ingenuity, Phil Jones’s hunger and Marcus Rashford’s pace, which makes defenders sit deeper and gives Bruno Fernandes room to roam. A trip to Goodison is never a doddle, but if United don’t beat Everton, they may as well go home. TdL  Everton v Manchester United, Saturday 12.30pm The shake-out between fourth and eighth places in the table may turn out to be the most absorbing and tense of all the top flight’s subplots this season, and Wolves’ tenacity in staying in the hunt for the European slots perhaps deserves more credit than it has received – particularly as they are currently without Rúben Neves and Raúl Jiménez. Bruno Lage has stressed the importance of teamwork and even a bit of tough love in getting the best out of his side – he said this week that his rant at the club’s youngsters after March’s defeat by Crystal Palace had helped them “wake up” – and the derby win over Aston Villa saw an encouraging demonstration of their resolve. Some of that resolve might still be needed by Newcastle, who lapsed alarmingly into old ways in their capitulation at Tottenham last weekend and who may be anxious that all that Saudi oil money has not yet bought them safety. TD  Newcastle v Wolves, Friday 8pm The difference in Arsenal this season, compared with the previous two, is their ability to lord it over supposedly “lesser” teams. Or it was until Monday night, when Crystal Palace ran rings round them. Even after that, Arsenal’s record against clubs outside the big six remains formidable: 16 wins, three draws and three losses, making 51 points from 22 games. All those defeats have come on the road and in the evening, so a 3pm kick-off at home should be just what the doctor ordered. But Brighton have more away draws than anyone else this season (seven from 14 games), so it’s not a shoo-in. And with Kieran Tierney ruled out for the rest of the season, Mikel Arteta doesn’t have a left-back he can trust to keep Tariq Lamptey quiet. TdL  Arsenal v Brighton, Saturday 3pm As someone who transformed Chelsea defensively when he succeeded Frank Lampard, Thomas Tuchel must be alarmed at just how open Chelsea have been in recent home schoolings by Brentford and Real Madrid. Admittedly, not all opponents will boast creative midfielders of the effortless class and incision of Luka Modric or Christian Eriksen, but those two defeats were rooted in more than individual errors. Chelsea suddenly look easy to score against and, given that Tuchel appears to have given up hope of turning the Madrid tie around, hanging on to a top-four place is now a priority, and is by no means a given. Southampton, winless in five, appear to have entered a familiar end-of-season drift, so could be just the opponents Chelsea need but with the best free-kick taker in the country, James Ward-Prowse, in fine fettle there are no grounds for complacency. TD  Southampton v Chelsea, Saturday 3pm Watford’s last meeting with Leeds took place so long ago that the Hornets were still being managed by Xisco Muñoz. Six months and three sackings later, the men in the technical area will be Roy Hodgson and Jesse Marsch. Hodgson has been the manager at more Premier League clubs (six) than Marsch has Premier League matches (five), but he would surely be happy to swap places with him now. After six defeats in a row, Leeds suddenly turned over a new leaf in mid-March, beating Norwich and Wolves before drawing with Southampton to open up a five-point breathing space between them and the bottom four. Watford have been better organised under Hodgson, as expected, but they still can’t get a tune out of a talented attack and remain bafflingly bad at Vicarage Road. In the home table they are bottom, with only seven points from 14 games. Leeds can afford to lose or draw this one; Watford cannot. TdL  Watford v Leeds, Saturday 3pm Don’t tell Pep but for the past six weeks, Tottenham have been the second-best team in the league. The top-flight form table has Antonio Conte’s side second only to Liverpool after winning five and losing one of their past six games. Chelsea have the same record but goal difference forcefully separates the sides quite: while both teams have conceded five, Spurs have scored 21 to Chelsea’s 12. Villa, by contrast, have lost their last three matches after winning the three before that. It is hard to see them getting much out of this one unless Philippe Coutinho treats Spurs’ defence with the same contempt that Cristiano Ronaldo showed on his way to a hat-trick at Old Trafford. TdL  Aston Villa v Tottenham, Saturday 5.30pm Beating Everton on Wednesday should have reinvigorated Burnley but they need to follow it up at rock-bottom Norwich. The Clarets have already won back-to-back games this term when they defeated Brighton away and Spurs at home – collecting half their season’s tally of four league wins. Only Norwich can match that low bar, but Sean Dyche’s side at least have 12 draws to put them within a point of 17th place. A second consecutive victory could take Burnley out of the relegation zone, helping build momentum for a season-defining spell with home games against Southampton and Wolves coming before a trip to relegation rivals Watford. Failure t take all three points at Carrow Road would be a blow to a side desperate to secure a sixth consecutive season in the top flight. Burnley are likely to end the season with their lowest points total since promotion in 2016 but they have shown before that they know how to survive. WU  Norwich v Burnley, Sunday 2pm For all the rare and understandable euphoria that has accompanied West Ham’s progress in Europe, they’ve rarely been at their best in the league since the turn of the year. Yet such is the inconsistency around them that they’re still in the mix for European qualification. Sunday brings a chance to avenge Brentford’s smash-and-grab win in October and with Jarrod Bowen returning from injury to score the winner against Everton last weekend and the opener against Lyon on Thursday, the Hammers should have some of their potency restored. Bowen, a refreshing old-school example of a player plucked from the Football League to thrive at the top level, scored West Ham’s goal against Brentford earlier in the season. Thomas Frank’s defence will need to be on its guard if the Bees are to maintain the momentum generated by their win at Chelsea. An entertaining cross-town derby awaits. TD  Brentford v West Ham, Sunday 2pm Crystal Palace have lost twice in their last 13 games in all competitions, with only Liverpool and Chelsea defeating them since mid-January. The run has taken them to ninth in the Premier League and an FA Cup semi-final. They have not finished in the top flight’s top half since 1991 but Patrick Vieira has created an exciting side to watch, able to call upon the likes of Wilfried Zaha, Michael Olise and Conor Gallagher to help them reach 42 goals already, nine behind their best-ever Premier League total with eight games still to go. The defence cannot be forgotten, either, as Palace currently have a positive goal difference, something they have not managed in the top flight for 31 years. A ninth-place finish might not be too exciting for most clubs but for Palace it would show the rapid growth they have made under Vieira. Victory over the team currently in 10th would keep them on track with the finish line in sight.

4/8/2022,"A bullish Tiger Woods declared himself “right where I need to be” after marking his remarkable recovery from serious injury with a one-under-par round of 71 at the Masters. Woods, having not played competitive golf since November 2020 and 14 months on from a serious car crash that left him fearing his lower right leg may need to be amputated, commanded huge gallery support on day one at Augusta National. The crowds were left impressed: Woods made three birdies and two bogeys to sit just four shots from the lead. He has victory in his sights. “I was able to finish up in the red,” said Woods. “I am right where I need to be. The place was electric. I had a terrible warmup session. I hit it awful. I went back to what my dad always said. ‘Did you accomplish your task in the warmup? It’s a warmup. Did you warm up?’ Yes, I did. ‘Now go play.’ That’s exactly what I did, I went and played. “I forgot whatever I did on the range and just went ahead and played; shot for shot, hit the ball in the correct spot, committed to what I’m doing, left myself in the right angles, hopefully make a few putts, and let’s get after this thing. Yeah, I was able to do that.” Woods, a five-time Masters champion, admitted it felt like a win of sorts even to be competing here. He explained “lots of ice baths” would be required before he tees off in round two on Friday afternoon. “If you would have seen how my leg looked to where it’s at now,” added the 46-year-old. “Some of the guys [fellow players] know. They’ve seen the pictures and they’ve come over to the house and they’ve seen it. To see where I’ve been, to get from there to here, it was no easy task. “I can swing a golf club. The walking’s not easy, it’s difficult. It’s going to be difficult for the rest of my life. That’s just the way it is but I’m able to do it. People have no idea how hard it’s been. My team does. They’ve worked with me every single day. We haven’t taken a day off since I got out of the bed after three months [post-accident]. So it’s commitment to getting back and commitment to getting back to a level that I feel that I can still do it. I did something positive today.”",Sport/Sport,Tiger Woods says he is ‘right where I need to be’ after Masters first round,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/07/tiger-woods-says-he-is-right-where-i-need-to-be-after-masters-first-round
