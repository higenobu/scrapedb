3/18/2022,"Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) and Senator Chris Murphy (D., Conn.) tangled in an angry exchange on the floor of the upper chamber of Congress on Thursday. It began with a speech by Sasse in which he noted a tweet from Murphy taking aim at the Nebraska senator, among other Republicans, for voting against the $1.5 trillion omnibus package that included $13.6 billion in aid for Ukraine. Sasse expressed frustration with the fact that a bill providing emergency aid to Ukraine was not passed sooner on its own instead of being tacked on to the enormous omnibus package last week, and he justified his vote on that basis. “We spent 13 billion dollars on Ukrainian aid out of a total appropriations package of $1.5 trillion. So for those of you doing math at home, that’s less than 1 percent of what we passed in the middle of the night last week that was actually Ukrainian aid,” explained Sasse. “Ukrainian aid was a little bit of sugar on the larger medicine of a $1.5 trillion bill,” he added. Murphy’s implication that Republicans were registering their opposition to the aid within the large bill represented, according to Sasse, an attempt to “bully the other side.” Sasse continued on with a denunciation of politicians who provide fan-service to a narrow slice of the populace to the detriment of the American people and their governing institutions, using Murphy’s tweet as a prime example. He explained the purpose of the speech by observing that “if you allow liars to constantly lie, and they can get away with it, then they just keep doing it.” Murphy began his response by wondering aloud if Sasse had broken Senate rules by accusing him of “tribal hackery” in a chart that stood beside Sasse as he delivered his speech and complaining that Republicans often fail to “cast their vote in a way that is aligned with their voice.” He called it “concerning” that Republicans voted against the omnibus while critiquing the Biden administration for not doing enough for Ukraine because it reflected the more general “lack of interest in compromise” that he characterized as “a fealty to the perfect and an antagonism to the good” in the Senate’s culture. Sasse jumped in to ask Murphy a direct question: “Do you believe that the people who voted against it [the omnibus bill], voted against it because they were against Ukrainian aid?” “Every one of us approaches a big-” replied Murphy before being cut off. “I’m asking a really simple question,” said Sasse. “Do you think that a single person that your Twitter self-pleasuring was for, do you think a single person that voted against it, voted against it because they were against Ukrainian aid?” “Absolutely not,” said Murphy. “Then what’s the point of the tweet?” asked Sasse. Murphy reiterated his point about there not being enough compromise in the institution. At that point, Sasse separated the debate into being about three issues: Ukrainian aid, the budget process, and grandstanding. He noted that the real conflict between Murphy and himself was the third, and argued that “the Republic got dumber” as a consequence of the Connecticut senator’s misleading tweet. “I think it’s convenient for Republicans to consistently eviscerate the president for his conduct, but then not be willing to cast the difficult votes necessary to help the president effectuate a policy there,” said Murphy, who argued that the omnibus was the “only” way the Senate could have provided funds to Ukraine. Sasse called passing the omnibus or sending no aid to Ukraine a “false choice,” and Murphy defended it by saying there while there were infinite other options, Sasse’s choice was “convenient” given the fact that that was the option on the table, though he agreed that the budget process was dysfunctional. While he never apologized for his tweet, Murphy did say that he would “take the senator’s words seriously and try to raise it in a way that is constructive” in the future. Sasse closed out the exchange by agreeing that there’s rampant grandstanding on both sides of the partisan aisle, agreeing that the Biden administration is willing to spend money on Ukrainian aid, and restating his frustration with the budget process. The testy argument between the two senators functioned as a direct back-and-forth for much of its duration, in defiance of Senate rules.

3/18/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's military said on Thursday that it had spotted four large Russian amphibious warfare ships sailing close to its islands as they traveled west, possibly towards Europe. Pictures of the amphibious transports, typically used for landing expeditionary forces ashore, published by Japan's defence ministry showed what appeared to be military trucks loaded onto the deck of one of the vessels. We don't know where they are heading, but their heading suggest it is possible,"" a Japanese defence ministry spokesman said. Asked if they could be bound for Ukraine, he said ""it is possible"". A Japanese Self Defense Force maritime patrol first detected the Russian vessels, which can carry dozens of tanks other military vehicles and hundreds of troops, on Tuesday and monitored them as they passed West from the Pacific Ocean to the Sea of Japan through the narrow Tsuruga Strait separating Japan's main Honshu island from Hokkaido island on Wednesday. It is unusual for Russian ships to pass through the strait so close to Japanese territory, the military spokesman said. Armed with anti-tank weapons supplied by the United States and other countries Ukrainian fighters have taken a heavy toll on Russian armour and fuel trucks, meaning Moscow, which describes its attack as a ""special operation,"" may need to reinforce its forces with new equipment. NATO allies, which have already supplied 20,000 anti-tank and other weapons to Ukraine, on Wednesday said they would keep helping the country resist the Russian attack.

3/18/2022,"U.S. Olympic figure skater Alysa Liu and her father Arthur Liu — a former political refugee — were among those targeted in a spying operation that the Justice Department alleges was ordered by the Chinese government, the elder Liu says. Arthur Liu told The Associated Press he had been contacted by the FBI last October, and warned about the scheme just as his 16-year-old daughter was preparing for the Winter Olympics that took place in Beijing in February. The father said he did not tell his daughter about the issue so as not to scare her or distract her from the competition. “We believed Alysa had a very good chance of making the Olympic team and truly were very scared,” Arthur Liu said late Wednesday. The Justice Department earlier in the day announced charges against five men accused of acting on behalf of the Chinese government in a series of brazen and wide-ranging schemes to stalk and harass Chinese dissidents in the United States. Arthur Liu said he and his daughter were included in the criminal complaint as “Dissident 3” and “family member,” respectively. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said he was “not aware of the specifics"" surrounding the allegations, and said China is “firmly opposed to the U.S. slandering by making an issue of this out of thin air."" “China always asks Chinese citizens to abide by the laws and regulations of host countries, and we would never ask our citizens to engage in activities that violate local laws,"" Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing Thursday. “The so-called transnational harassment schemes are just trumped up."" Liu said he took a stand against China’s bullying by allowing his daughter to compete at the recent Olympic Winter Games, where she placed 7th in the women’s event. “This is her moment. This is her once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to compete at the Olympic Games. I’m not going to let them stop her from going and I’ll do whatever I can to make sure she’s safe and I’m willing to make sacrifices so she can enjoy the moment,” Arthur Liu said. “I’m not going to let them win — to stop me — to silence me from expressing my opinions anywhere.” The father said he agreed to let his daughter compete with assurances from the State Department and U.S. Olympic Committee that she would be closely protected while competing in China, with at least two people escorting her at all times. “They are probably just trying to intimidate us, to ... in a way threaten us not to say anything, to cause trouble to them and say anything political or related to human rights violations in China,” Arthur Liu said. “I had concerns about her safety. The U.S. government did a good job protecting her.” He said a man called him last November, months before the Olympics, claiming to be an official with the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee, and asked for his and his daughters’ passport numbers. Arthur Liu refused to provide them and said he would call his contact at Team USA the next day. “I didn’t feel good about it. I felt something fishy was going on,” Arthur Liu said. “From my dealings with the U.S. Figure Skating association, they would never call me on the phone to get copies of our passports. I really cut it short once I realized what he was asking for.” A spokesman for U.S. Figure Skating deferred comment to Team USA. The U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee in a statement to AP said: “The security of the U.S. delegation is our number one priority, and we work closely with our partners, including government agencies, to ensure athlete safety at the Games.” Arthur Liu said he does not remember being approached in person by Matthew Ziburis, who was arrested Tuesday on charges that include conspiring to commit interstate harassment and criminal use of a means of identification. Ziburis was released on a $500,000 bond. Prosecutors allege that Ziburis was hired to perform surveillance on the family and pose as a member of an international sports committee to ask Arthur Liu for a copy of his and Alysa Liu's passports by claiming it was a travel “preparedness check” related to COVID-19. The complaint said when Arthur Liu refused, Ziburis threatened to delay or deny them international travel. The elder Liu said he left China in his 20s as a political refugee because he had protested the Communist government following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. Arthur Liu eventually settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, put himself through law school and nurtured one of America’s most promising athletes. His daughter visited their ancestral homeland for the first time while at the Olympics. Arthur Liu said his daughter has generally been warmly embraced by Chinese fans and media, who consider her to be one of their own. But through the spying investigation, he learned that China was aware of an Instagram message about human rights violations against the ethnic minority Uyghurs that his daughter once posted. During the Games, Alysa Liu also told her father that she was approached by a stranger late one night at a cafeteria after the free skate event, and that the man followed her and asked her to come to his apartment. “I’ve kind of accepted my life to be like this because of what I chose to do in 1989, to speak up against the government. And I know the Chinese government will extend their long hands into any corner in the world,” Arthur Liu said. “I’m going to continue to enjoy life and live life as I want to live. I’m not going to let this push me down and I’m not going to let them succeed.” ___ Follow AP journalist Sally Ho on Twitter at http://twitter.com/_sallyho.",U.S./Associated Press,"US Olympian Alysa Liu, father targeted in Chinese spy case",https://news.yahoo.com/u-olympian-alysa-liu-father-075859312.html

3/18/2022,"Ukrainian snipers had a problem: Russian forces in eastern Ukraine were trying to blind them. As the Ukrainians were looking through their scopes in order to find their targets, the Russians had begun pinpointing their location using the glare of the glass, and were shooting high-energy lasers into them, damaging the snipers’ eyesight. The two sides were squaring off in close proximity. In early 2014, Russia had already invaded and annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula. Shortly thereafter, pro-Russia insurgents in the eastern Donbas region began a grinding secessionist war against Kyiv. Russian troops soon entered the fray. So, quietly, did the CIA. As the battle lines hardened in Donbas, a small, select group of veteran CIA paramilitaries made their first secret trips to the frontlines to meet with Ukrainian counterparts there, according to former U.S. officials. CIA paramilitaries soon concluded that, in Russia and its proxies, the agency was facing an adversary whose capabilities far outmatched the Islamist groups that CIA had been battling in the post-9/11 wars. “We learned a lot real quick,” says a former senior intelligence official — including about the Russians’ laser-blinding techniques. “That s*** wouldn’t happen with the Taliban.” Since Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine last month — which transformed a long-simmering, attritional conflict into an explosive, all-out war — the Ukrainian military has defied predictions of a rapid collapse, holding key cities against the Russian advance and inflicting punishing losses to Russian troops and materiel. The Ukrainian military has claimed to have killed three Russian generals, including at least one reportedly eliminated by sniper fire. (Yahoo News could not independently verify whether the Russian commanders were killed by CIA-trained troops.) At least some of the fierce resistance by Ukrainian forces has its roots in a now shuttered covert CIA training program run from Ukraine’s eastern frontlines, former intelligence officials tell Yahoo News. The initiative was described to Yahoo News by over half a dozen former officials, all of whom requested anonymity to speak freely about sensitive intelligence matters. The program was run under previously existing authorities for the CIA and did not require a new legal determination for the agency, known as a covert action finding, according to a former national security official. As part of the Ukraine-based training program, CIA paramilitaries taught their Ukrainian counterparts sniper techniques; how to operate U.S.-supplied Javelin anti-tank missiles and other equipment; how to evade digital tracking the Russians used to pinpoint the location of Ukrainian troops, which had left them vulnerable to attacks by artillery; how to use covert communications tools; and how to remain undetected in the war zone while also drawing out Russian and insurgent forces from their positions, among other skills, according to former officials. After Russia’s 2014 incursion, the U.S. military also helped run a long-standing, publicly acknowledged training program for Ukrainian troops in the country’s western region, far from the frontlines. That program also included instruction in how to use Javelin anti-tank missiles and sniper training. Yahoo News reported in January on the CIA’s secret U.S.-based training initiative for Ukrainian special operations forces and other intelligence personnel. That program, which began in 2015, also included instruction in firearms, camouflage techniques and covert communications. Yahoo News’ prior report also revealed that CIA paramilitaries had traveled to eastern Ukraine to assist forces loyal to Kyiv in their fight against Russia and its separatist allies. U.S. officials previously denied to Yahoo News that the CIA training programs were ever offensively oriented. “The purpose of the training, and the training that was delivered, was to assist in the collection of intelligence,” said a senior intelligence official. Until now, however, the details of the CIA’s paramilitary training program on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines have never been revealed. This initiative, say former agency officials, has helped battle-hardened Ukrainian special operations forces for the current Russian assault, which has plunged Europe into its worst conflict in decades. (The CIA declined to comment. The National Security Council referred queries to the CIA. The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington, D.C., did not return a request for comment.) Former U.S. intelligence officials believe the program is still bearing fruit. “I think we’re seeing a big impact from snipers. Especially as Russian forces get bogged down from lack of supplies,” said the former senior official. “I think the training really paid off.” *** When CIA paramilitaries first traveled to eastern Ukraine in the aftermath of Russia’s initial 2014 incursion, their brief was twofold. First, they were ordered to determine how the agency could best help train Ukrainian special operations personnel fight the Russian military forces, and their separatist allies, waging a grinding war against Ukrainian troops in the Donbas region. But the second part of the mission was to test the mettle of the Ukrainians themselves, according to former officials. The agency needed to determine the “backbone” of the Ukrainians, said a former senior CIA official. The question was, “Are they going to get rolled, or are going to stand up and fight?” recalled the former official. The Ukrainians, the CIA paramilitaries reported back to their superiors, were indeed ready for battle. The CIA operatives taught their Ukrainian counterparts the best skills for irregular warfare, said the former senior intelligence official. “We tried to really focus on operational planning, then really hard military skills like long-range marksmanship — not just the capacity to do it, but to know how to do it on a battlefield, to really deplete the leadership on the other side,” said the former senior intelligence official. Because of the sensitivities of the mission, the agency chose to send experienced, mature operatives, recalled former officials. The thinking was, “one miscalculation, one overzealous paramilitary guy, and we’ve got ourselves a problem,” said the former official. “Everything we did in Ukraine had a chance to be misinterpreted, and escalate the tensions.” Accompanying the more strategic-minded, veteran paramilitaries sent by the agency were tactical specialists, like snipers, who also worked for the CIA Special Activities Center. But after over a decade focused on the war on terror, the high-tech battlefield environment was a shock to the CIA. Russian soldiers and their proxies were using drones, cell towers and other equipment to triangulate the phones and electronic devices of the Ukrainians and CIA paramilitaries on the frontlines — and then rapidly targeting them with that information, according to former officials. Ukrainian soldiers “were using mobile phones in a trench,” recalled a former intelligence official. “People were getting blown to bits.” It was “almost like SkyNet in a ‘Terminator’ movie — that’s what the eastern edge of Ukraine started looking like,” says the former senior CIA official, referring to the malevolent, self-aware, weaponized artificial intelligence system in the Arnold Schwarzenegger films. The Russians’ operations on the frontlines would evolve rapidly in response to the Ukrainians’ and the CIA’s own there, according to former officials. CIA paramilitaries needed to make quick adjustments, recalled former officials. Agency officials were forced to develop new modes of secure communications systems so paramilitaries could “communicate and then move before you get the direction finding from the Russians” and “they start[ed] rocketing the crap out of you,” recalled the former senior official. The CIA had to solve the tradecraft challenges that arose from working in eastern Ukraine. The environment was unique, where “Moscow rules” — that is, the need for extreme operational care, because of the Russians’ counterintelligence capabilities — converged with an active war zone. “We were caught with our pants down,” says the former senior CIA official. But the agency soon developed new tools to ensure that agency paramilitaries could transmit information to each other securely on the frontlines, as well as to Washington, without tipping off the Russians. Agency paramilitaries also shared some of these techniques with their Ukrainian counterparts. The last thing the CIA wanted was a direct confrontation with the Russians that could explode into a wider conflict. Though the program grew over time, it was kept very small on purpose, with the number of CIA paramilitaries initially sent to eastern Ukraine in the low single digits. This was in order to minimize the agency’s exposure, and to protect the Ukrainians from arousing the Russians’ ire, according to former officials. And the rules of the agency’s engagement on the Ukrainian frontlines was clear: Advise and train, but do not take part in combat yourself, recalled former officials. The agency impressed upon the CIA paramilitaries traveling to the front that “the Ukrainians have very effective special operations,” recalled the former senior intelligence official. The directive was, “Your job is to make them more effective.” CIA officials believed that “just sending six guys to be six snipers is not really going to be something that’s going to affect the battle space,” recalled this official. “Our job is to have an exponential impact; it’s not to get our badge for shooting a Russian or something.” Still, shortly after Donald Trump took office in 2017, National Security Council officials were concerned that, though the CIA paramilitaries in Ukraine were prohibited from engaging in combat, the parameters of their mission, which had begun under the Obama administration, were ambiguous. “We worried that the authorities might be too far-ranging,” said a former national security official. One big question was, “How far can you go with existing covert action authorities?” recalled the former official. “If, God forbid, they’ve shot some Russians, is that a problem? Do you need special authorities for that?” White House officials also worried about what might happen if CIA operatives were captured by pro-Russian forces on what was supposed to be a secret mission, recalled the former official. The discussion about the agency’s program was part of a broader review at the Trump White House of U.S. support for Kyiv — and what Moscow’s red lines might be, recalled the former official. “There was a school of thought that the Russians spoke the good old language of proxy war,” and that the CIA’s covert (as well as the military’s acknowledged) training programs and the U.S.'s overt supplying of weapons to Ukraine were therefore within historically acceptable bounds, the former official said. CIA leadership and White House officials both understood — but still fretted over — the risks. “I don’t know how we didn’t get anybody injured, to be honest,” says the former senior intelligence official. But the covert nature of the mission ensured deniability. U.S. officials “wouldn’t want to say, We just had a CIA officer killed by a Russian” in Ukraine, recalled the former official. “That would put the president or the White House in a very bad position.” The Ukraine-based CIA program operated for years, according to former officials. But as the threat of a large-scale Russian invasion became increasingly acute last month, the Biden administration, still feeling the sting of the Afghanistan withdrawal, pulled all CIA personnel out of the country, including war-zone-hardened agency paramilitaries, according to a former intelligence official in close touch with colleagues in U.S. government. The administration was “terrified of even clandestine folks being on the frontline,” says the former official. But even if the CIA’s cadre of paramilitary trainers are no longer in Ukraine, the effect of the agency’s training programs — both in the U.S. and on Ukraine’s eastern front — “cannot be overestimated,” said the former senior CIA official. These elite units trained by the agency have created “a strong nucleus” for Ukraine’s larger military forces today, according to this official. In addition to the hard skills these operatives are bringing to the fight with Russian troops, some of the benefits are more intangible, according to former officials. The CIA-trained special operations units set an example by “getting some small wins” and by “providing some success stories” for the larger Ukrainian military, says the former senior official. Courage can be contagious, notes the former official. So then, empowered by their comrades’ victories, “you get people that are charging to the sounds of the gunfire.”",World/Yahoo News,Exclusive: Secret CIA training program in Ukraine helped Kyiv prepare for Russian invasion,https://news.yahoo.com/exclusive-secret-cia-training-program-in-ukraine-helped-kyiv-prepare-for-russian-invasion-090052743.html

3/18/2022,"Ron Jeremy’s serial rape case was suspended in Los Angeles on Thursday after the jailed porn star appeared incoherent and unable to recognize his own lawyer ahead of a critical hearing in the case. “I was just up in the cell where he was being kept, and I tried to get his attention unsuccessfully,” his defense lawyer, Stuart Goldfarb, told the court ahead of what was supposed to be a key hearing in the disturbing case involving 21 alleged victims. “He was unable to determine who I was and wouldn’t accommodate both myself and the bailiff to fit into the wheelchair to come down here. I don’t think he should be forced to come down here under these circumstances.” More from Rolling Stone Inside Ron Jeremy's Ridiculous Motion To Have 21 Sexual Assault Trials Ron Jeremy Gets New May 2 Trial Date in Los Angeles County Rape Case Ron Jeremy Rape Trial Due to Begin in February, Judge Says After stating that the bailiff had also told the court Jeremy was “incoherent” and “not obeying commands,” Judge George Lomeli said from the bench that he would suspend the proceedings. The judge referred the case to a mental health courthouse for an April 1 hearing and set a follow-up date back in his criminal courtroom for April 19. “Hopefully” by that date, “evaluations done by a psychiatrist on each side regarding the issues of competency” will clarify the situation, Lomeli said. Jeremy, whose legal name is Ronald Jeremy Hyatt, was indicted last August on 34 counts of sexual assault involving the 21 complaining witnesses. The charges, dating as far back as 1996, involve alleged victims ranging in age from 15 to 51 and a dozen counts of forcible assault. He had pleaded not guilty. According to court documents, Jeremy allegedly used his role as a cuddly elder statesman in the porn industry to disarm women and entice them into secluded areas. Many of the alleged assaults were said to have taken place at the Rainbow Bar and Grill, a West Hollywood dining establishment where Jeremy was a regular who enjoyed VIP access to employee areas. The Thursday hearing was supposed to center on Jeremy’s request to have his case broken up into 21 separate trials. “Allowing Mr. Hyatt’s jury to hear about dozens of allegations of alleged misconduct will prevent his jurors from judging him fairly on each charged count and from scrupulously applying the burden of proof,” his defense motion calling for the separate trials reads. Prosecutors oppose the motion, saying the charged offenses involve the same class of crimes and are “connected by a common plan.” That means they would be cross-admissible in separate trials and involve overlapping witnesses, which would waste judicial resources. They argue eight of the 21 Janes Does allegedly were attacked at the Rainbow Bar and Grill “using very similar methods.” “More important to the people than the time of the jurors or court is the risk of re-traumatization inherent in having sexual assault victims testify repeatedly,” Assistant District Attorney Marlene Martinez argues in her office’s opposition filing obtained by Rolling Stone. “In all 21 cases, the defendant preyed on victims that were vulnerable and unable to fight back. Whether that was by isolating the women in a bathroom, in a bedroom, at his friend’s house, in a parking lot or by perpetrating a surprise attack upon them, the defendant never gave the women an opportunity to fight back as he sexually assaulted them,” the reply says. “The only way to prevent a substantial waste of court time, juror time and victim and witness time is to have a joint trial.” The judge declined to hear further arguments or issue a ruling Thursday pending Jeremy’s mental health evaluation.

3/18/2022,"By Sakura Murakami and Elaine Lies TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake off Japan's northeast coast left thousands of homes without water and power on Thursday and forced factories to suspend operations, adding to supply chain woes for makers of smartphones, electronics and automobiles worldwide. The magnitude 7.4 tremblor struck just before midnight on Wednesday east of the Fukushima prefecture, the same area that suffered Japan's biggest quake 11 years ago. At least two people died and 161 were injured in the latest quake, according to government spokesman Hirokazu Matsuno, whereas thousands perished in the 2011 disaster, when a magnitude 9.1 magnitude quake also triggered a tsunami and caused a meltdown at a nuclear power plant. There were no abnormalities reported at any nuclear power plants this time, though authorities said a fire alarm had been triggered at a turbine building at the plant crippled in 2011. The quake still caused havoc for industry, however. Chipmaker Renesas Electronics Corp a major supplier of automotive chips, suspended production at two semiconductor plants and partially stopped output at a third. Among them was its Naka plant in Ibaraki prefecture just north of Tokyo, which supplies semiconductors to auto companies worldwide. Chip shortages caused by COVID-19-related disruption have already forced many auto firms to cut back production. Electronic components maker Murata Manufacturing also halted operations at its factories, as one of them making smartphone parts had a fire following the quake. Sony Group Corp halted production at two factories in Miyagi prefecture and a third factory in Yamagata prefecture. The facilities produce storage media, laser diodes and image sensors. Toyota Motor Corp said it would restart work at reduced capacity at two factories on Thursday night, after operations were suspended as soon as the quake struck. Japan's biggest refiner, Eneos Corp, shut its Sendai refinery including the 145,000 barrel-per-day crude distillation unit (CDU). Authorities indefinitely suspended a Shinkansen bullet train service, and closed at least one major highway to the region for safety checks. BAD MEMORIES Parts of building facades tumbled into streets in some areas of Fukushima. Television footage showed a steep tiled roof crumpled over a parked, crushed car and workers examining cracked highways. ""This one felt different (to the 2011 quake), it was huge. I had to hang on to something to stay upright,"" said Aoi Hoshino, who owns a bar in Fukushima. One of her customers shrugged off the initial tremors, but when the biggest one hit he stood up and shouted, ""This is a big one!"" she recalled, though the only damage in her bar were broken cups and picture frames. About 300 km (186 miles) south of Fukushima, areas of the capital Tokyo lost power for nearly three hours following quake. An earlier tsunami warning for the northeast coast was lifted and power was fully restored to the capital by the early hours of Thursday, although people in some parts of Fukushima were still waiting for electricity by the early evening. Matsuno said the Self-Defense Forces were delivering water to communities whose water systems were damaged, and residents of one town in Fukushima queued to fill plastic tanks. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said that the government would be on high alert for the possibility of further strong tremors over the next two to three days. The quake stuck at 11:36 p.m. local time (1400 GMT) just off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of 60 kilometres, according to the Japan Meteorological Agency.

3/18/2022,"Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, proposed cutting the IRS budget in half. IRS chief Chuck Rettig said ""you might be better off and save more money by just shutting it down completely."" The IRS is grappling with underfunding and understaffing amid new pandemic responsibilities. The IRS is currently contending with a reduced budget, staff, and new pandemic-era responsibilities, with the agency trying to dig itself out of a hole of millions of unprocessed returns and late refunds. Both the Treasury Department and the IRS have said that the agency needs much more long-term funding to get running at an acceptable capacity. Then there's Republican Sen. Rick Scott's solution: Shrink the IRS's budget by 50%. That formed part of his ""Rescue America"" plan that he rolled out last month. He pitched it as a Republican agenda, though one that he introduced as a rank-and-file Republican instead of in his role as the head of the party's Senate campaign fundraising arm. Democrats are pummeling its proposed tax hikes for Americans ahead of the midterms. In a Thursday Ways & Means Committee hearing, Representative Lloyd Doggett asked IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig about the potential impact of halving the agency's budget. ""If the IRS budget was cut by 50%, you might be better off and save more money by just shutting it down completely,"" Rettig said. ""We account for 96% of the gross revenue of the United States of America! How are you going to fund what we need to fund and what every American deserves?"" Doggett, a Democrat from Texas, said that ""perhaps shutting it down is exactly what those who'd make this outrageous proposal have in mind."" But the architect of the plan didn't see it that way. Scott defended his agenda and argued he didn't intend to shutter the IRS by proposing drastic budget cuts. ""We got to make this system where we don't need a big IRS,"" the Florida Republican told Insider in a brief interview. ""We got to make the system simple. I mean the IRS, it's so complex. If you can get lawyers and accountants you can figure out how to not pay taxes, it shouldn't be that way."" As Scott noted, tax evasion is a potentially trillion dollar problem. The Treasury Department has said that the wealthiest 1% of taxpayers dodge $163 billion in taxes annually. But the answer to cutting down on that tax evasion might be the opposite of Scott's proposal. The Treasury has said that allocating $80 billion in funding to the IRS for enforcement — the amount President Joe Biden proposed in the currently defunct Build Back Better Act — could bring in $700 billion in tax revenue in the next ten years. The IRS and Treasury Department have repeatedly sounded alarm bells over the agency's funding, or lack thereof. Heading into 2022, the IRS was still sitting on over 6 million unprocessed refunds, according to national taxpayer advocate Erin Collins. Rettig has been outspoken about the ""severe limitations"" that the IRS faces ""without long-term, predictable funding,"" and the burden that that places on taxpayers waiting for checks.

3/18/2022,"South Korean-born Russian short-track speed skater Viktor Ahn issued an apology after his wife’s skincare and cosmetics brand referred to Taiwan as a country.

The 36-year-old athlete, born Ahn Hyun-soo in Seoul in 1985, faced backlash from Chinese social media users over the weekend after they discovered that the website of the brand founded by his wife, Woo Na-ri, referred to Taiwan as a country.

In his apology letter on Weibo on Monday, Ahn said the “wrong information shown” on his wife’s website for her brand Nari “has been fixed.”

 

“I had a very pleasant time as a coach in China and I appreciate all the support from speed skating fans and internet users,” Ahn continued in the letter. “My family and I firmly respect the one-China policy. I hope for people’s forgiveness.”

The issue reportedly became a trending topic on Weibo, amassingaround 20 million views as of this writing. Junlebao, a Chinese dairy brand, also announced that they recently cut ties with the Russian athlete as their brand ambassador due to the controversy.

Nari apologized on Monday for “the incorrect information on our website which causes harm to Chinese users.” The brand explained that their website was built by a third-party company, and they admitted that they ""did not notice the false information"" until it became a hot topic online.

 

“At the moment, we have asked the third party to correct the error in time and also decided to terminate the cooperation with them,” the statement continued. “Thanks for your criticism and corrections. Therefore, we want to once again apologize to our friends who have always been caring about and supporting us.”

Ahn is considered one of the top athletes in short-track speed skating history, with six Olympic gold medals to his name.

After a falling out with his South Korean team, Ahn reportedly moved to Russia in 2011 and became a citizen. He then competed for the Russian team at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. He retired in 2020 and was tapped to coach China’s national team for the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.

Although Ahn issued an online apology, some social media users reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with his statement and called on the athlete to make the same statement outside of Weibo.

“I hope this is not another apology exclusively for Weibo users. If you truly think you are in the wrong here, please address the issue outside the Chinese internet,” a popular reply to Ahn’s Weibo post read.

Speaking to the Chinese state-runGlobal Times, Lü Chao, an expert on the Korean Peninsula at the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, said that “it is in fact a good thing for him to apologize on time after the mistake,” especially considering his role as a transnational sports ambassador.

“It would be inappropriate for people to hold on to this,"" Lü added. “It is a normal reaction for people to have insensitive topics like this. But we need to be calm to see the situations at the moment, instead of hurting a person who has helped the country a lot.”

3/18/2022,"Moscow and Kyiv have lifted hope of a potential breakthrough in Ukraine after three weeks of war. Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskyy said negotiations were becoming ""more realistic"", while Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said the proposals now being discussed were ""close to an agreement"". The marked change in tone came as Vladimir Putin, who ordered his troops into Ukraine on 24 February, said Moscow was ready to discuss neutral status for its neighbour. Ukraine's chief negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said Kyiv was seeking direct talks between Zelenskyy and Putin, but he dismissed an earlier report in the Financial Times that the two sides had already drawn up a draft 15-point peace plan. Three people close to the talks told the newspaper that the deal included a ceasefire being declared; the Ukrainian government declaring neutrality; Kyiv accepting limits on its armed forces; and Putin's forces withdrawing from the country. It would also require Kyiv to formally drop its ambition to join Nato and not host foreign military bases or weaponry. In exchange, they would get protection from allies, such as the US, UK and Turkey. However, Podolyak rejected the claims via Twitter, saying: ""Briefly. FT published a draft, which represents the requesting position of the Russian side. Nothing more. The Ukraine side has its own positions."" He did confirm some elements of the draft deal, including ""a ceasefire, withdrawal of Russian troops and security guarantees from a number of countries"". Speaking on the third straight day of talks, Lavrov confirmed there was ""some hope for compromise"", and highlighted two key points being put on the table: Russia seeks to ensure Ukraine maintains a neutral status, meaning it would never join Nato Ukraine seeks security guarantees that are ""legally verified"". Zelenskyy has appeared to acknowledge that Ukraine will not become a Nato member in one of the key elements of the negotiations. Ukraine's chief negotiator Podolyak added that, instead, the country could agree only to “a special version of neutrality with legally verified and non-protocol security guarantees"". In a statement on Telegram, he said: ""Ukraine has never been a militaristic state that attacks or plans to attack its neighbours, unlike some neighbours."" Read more: Zelenskyy says Russia’s position in negotiations is becoming ‘more realistic’ as fears deepen for Mariupol Putin has previously demanded Ukraine indefinitely rule out the possibility of joining Nato. The Kremlin said the sides were discussing a status for Ukraine similar to that of Austria or Sweden, members of the European Union that are outside the Nato military alliance. Lavrov also said of the talks: ""The negotiations are not easy for obvious reasons. But nevertheless, there is some hope of reaching a compromise."" ""Neutral status is now being seriously discussed along, of course, with security guarantees,"" he added. ""Now this very thing is being discussed in negotiations – there are absolutely specific formulations which in my view are close to agreement."" Three weeks into the invasion, Russian troops have been halted at the gates of Kyiv, having taken heavy losses and failed to seize any of Ukraine's biggest cities. Western officials believe Moscow thought it would win within days, and one of Putin's own military chiefs, National Guard head Viktor Zolotov, admitting on Tuesday that ""not everything"" was going to plan for the Russian forces. On the guard's website, the general said: “I would like to say yes, not everything is going as fast as we would like. ""But we are going towards our goal step by step and victory will be for us, and this icon will protect the Russian army and accelerate our victory."" However, on Wednesday Putin doubled down, claiming the ""special military operation"" was ""going to plan"". In a televised speech to government ministers, Putin claimed the West was trying to ""cancel Russia"" with an ""economic Blitzkreig"" of sanctions, but said the nation could bear the brunt. Putin also claimed that the war – which has displaced millions of people – has been used by the West to impose sanctions because ""they just don't want a strong and sovereign Russia"". Adding that the West's actions would ""only strengthen"" Russia, he added: ""The West doesn't even bother to hide the fact that its aim is to damage the entire Russian economy, every Russian."" Zolotov’s comments were in stark contrast to Russia's defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who told Putin on Friday: ""Everything is going according to plan.” Ukrainian officials have expressed hope this week that the war could end sooner than expected - even within weeks - as Moscow was coming to terms with a lack of fresh troops to keep fighting. In an intelligence assessment released on Wednesday, Britain said Russian forces were trapped on roads, struggling to cope with Ukrainian terrain and suffering from a failure to gain control of the air. ""The tactics of the Ukrainian Armed Forces have adeptly exploited Russia's lack of manoeuvre, frustrating the Russian advance and inflicting heavy losses on the invading forces,"" it said. Putin's invasion has sparked the biggest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War, with three million people having fled Ukraine in search of safety.

Exact numbers of those killed are so far impossible to verify, by Ukraine has claimed more than 12,000 Russian soldiers have died in the offensive. Over 2,000 civilians, including 100 children, are also thought to have been killed.

The slain generals were identified as Maj. Gen. Andrei Kolesnikov, Maj. Gen. Vitaly Gerasimov, Maj. Gen. Andrei Sukhovetsky, and on Wednesday, Maj. Gen. Oleg Mityaev. Some of those commanders were reportedly killed in combat, but ""two American military officials said that many Russian generals are talking on unsecured phones and radios,"" the Times reports, and ""in at least one instance, they said, the Ukrainians intercepted a general's call, geolocated it, and attacked his location, killing him and his staff.""

3/18/2022,"The president of Finland has spoken of his concern that Vladimir Putin could launch a ‘hybrid war’ on the country if it joins Nato. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin acknowledged the debate surrounding its membership of Nato ""will change”, having previously stated it is ""very unlikely"" Finland – which borders Russia – would apply for a Nato membership during her current term of office. Polling earlier this month showed around 62% of Finns now back such a move, the first time a majority of the population has done so and up from around 28% in February. But speaking on BBC’s Newsnight on Tuesday, Finnish president Sauli Niinisto warned Putin could unleash a hybrid war – a mixture of conventional warfare and other methods - if Finland were to press ahead with membership. Last month, Russia threatened ""serious military and political repercussions"" if the Nordic country were to join the Atlantic alliance. Niinisto said that while Finland is a “military non-alliance”, it is not neutral due to its “deep enhanced partnership with Nato”. Watch: Boris Johnson hosts Finnish President for talks at No. 10 Boris Johnson has hosted President of Finland Sauli Niinistö for bilateral talks at Downing Street following the Joint Expeditionary Force summit where President Zelensky addressed Western leaders via video-link. He warned: “I don't believe Russia will come with tanks. “I don't believe there will be a war but I believe there would be a hybrid war… there would be more tension going on.” Elina Valtonen, an MP for Finland’s National Coalition Party, said that a hybrid war on Finland would mean “other means of interfering with our sovereignty or security”. Watch: Nato - the western alliance that protects the security of Europe The Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian military base close to the border with Poland has raised new fears that Nato could be drawn into the conflict. 

Here we look at why Nato was formed, its purpose and its significance in the war between Russia and Ukraine. She explained: “For instance, sending a number refugees across our border, which has been tried by Putin a number of years ago in northern Finland… “It can be anything else – for instance interfering with electricity systems or cyber warfare.” Last month, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia had “noted the targeted efforts of Nato and other members of this alliance to involve Finland as well as Sweden [a fellow non-member] in this alliance"". She warned: ""We have seen this policy over a number of years... and Finland and Sweden should not base their security on damaging security of other countries. ""Their accession to Nato can have detrimental consequences... and face military and political consequences."" Part of Putin’s basis for war is to halt what he believes is a Nato advancement into eastern Europe, and demands that Ukraine changes its constitution so that it does not join either Nato or the EU. However, Ukraine was not on any formal path to joining Nato – a 30-member defensive alliance that includes nuclear powers like the US – before Putin invaded. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy has now said his country ""must admit"" that it wouldn't join Nato. Speaking in a meeting with leaders of the Joint Expeditionary Force this week, Zelenskyy said: ""It is clear that Ukraine is not a member of Nato. We understand that. We are adequate people. ""For years, we have heard about the supposedly open door, but we have also heard that we should not enter, and this is true and we must admit it.” Boris Johnson has also said there is “no way Ukraine is going to join Nato anytime soon” as Zelenskyy said peace talks with Russia had taken a “realistic turn”. Johnson, speaking to broadcasters at the Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, said: “I talked to Volodymyr (Zelenskyy) again yesterday and of course I understand what he is saying about Nato and the reality of the position. “And everybody has always said – and we’ve made it clear to Putin – that there is no way Ukraine is going to join Nato any time soon.” But Johnson said decisions about the future of the country had to “be for the Ukrainian people” and their “elected leader” to make, as he vowed Britain would continue to “back” Zelenskyy.

He said he had an allowance of $3,300 a month and needed UK government permission to spend money. He told Bloomberg he thought he had a good relationship with the West and ""couldn't be punished."" The Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman said in an interview that he didn't know how to live, three weeks after coming under sanctions, Bloomberg reported. Fridman, who has a net worth of $10.1 billion, Bloomberg's Billionaires Index said, was sanctioned by the European Union on February 28 and by the UK on March 15. He described the EU's sanctions as ""groundless and unfair"" at the time and said he would contest them, Reuters reported. Since the invasion of Ukraine began, Fridman's wealth dropped by $4 billion, Bloomberg reported. ""I don't know how to live,"" Fridman told Bloomberg. ""I don't know. I really don't know."" Fridman, a cofounder of the London investment firm LetterOne and former board member of the Russian banking company Alfa-Bank, told Bloomberg that the sanctions meant that his last working UK bank card was frozen. Fridman, who lives in the UK, has an allowance of 2,500 pounds ($3,300) per month and has to apply for a license to spend money before the British government decides how reasonable the request is, he told Bloomberg. ""My problems are really nothing compared with their problems,"" he told Bloomberg, referring to Ukrainians trapped in the conflict. Fridman resigned from the board of Alfa-Bank one day after the EU sanctioned him. He also stepped down from the board of directors of LetterOne, the investment firm he cofounded. Fridman said he thought he had a good relationship with the West because of his trips to Washington and an Alfa-Bank fellowship program he set up for American, British, and German citizens in 2004. ""We sincerely believed we are such good friends of the Western world that we couldn't be punished,"" he told Bloomberg.

3/18/2022,"When Justin Blauwet made his “once-in-lifetime discovery” while observing an engineering firm’s construction project, he knew what it was right away. That’s because he always had an interest in fossils and pre-historic animals, and his two young sons also have a “huge interest” in dinosaurs. What he had found was a woolly mammoth tooth, his employer DGR Engineering said, and officials later confirmed Blauwet had successfully identified his rare find. “I’m a ‘nerd’ like that,” he said in the company’s March 16 news release. The engineering firm said Blauwet was “performing construction observation on a lift station project” at property owned by Northwest Iowa Community College (NCC) on Friday, March 4 when he spotted the “clearly exposed” tooth on the ground. “This is something you don’t find on campus every day — a woolly mammoth tooth!!” NCC shared on Facebook. DGR Engineering says employees then contacted Paleontology Repository Instructor Tiffany Adrain with the University of Iowa for confirmation. “While discovery of mammoth remains is not uncommon in Iowa, once the bones and teeth are out in the open, they can fall apart and disappear quickly because they are not completely fossilized,” Adrain said, according to DGR. “This was a lucky find.” The tooth weighed in at 11.2 pounds and measures 11 inches by 7 inches by 4 inches. “This is an upper 3rd molar, probably a right,” Chris Widga, head curator at East Tennessee State University, said in the news release. “Based on the degree of wear, this animal was probably in its early 30s when it died.” The preserved tooth has likely been in the ground for over 20,000 years, since the Last Glacial Maximum, according to the news release. “Measures are being taken to protect the tooth from drying out too rapidly and possibly disintegrating,” DGR said. The city of Sheldon says the tooth belongs to NCC, and the university plans to donate it to the Sheldon Prairie Museum. “NCC already has many connections with its communities forged throughout the past half-century. When Blauwet discovered this woolly mammoth tooth, it uncovered an even deeper connection — one that now ties our campus property way back to the prehistoric era of the retreating glaciers,” said NCC President Dr. John Hartog in the release. “Since NCC is the public college for all of its communities, we are happy to display the tooth in the Sheldon Prairie Museum as a semi-permanently loaned display. “This way, everyone from across our service area can come to the museum to see and appreciate this artifact,” he continued. “We might display it at the College for special occasions, but we will house the artifact in the Sheldon Prairie Museum.” Sheldon Prairie Museum confirmed the tooth is “coming soon.” Sheldon is in the northwest corner of Iowa, about 225 miles from Des Moines.

3/18/2022,"By Guy Faulconbridge LONDON (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday Joe Biden's claim that President Vladimir Putin was a ""war criminal"" for invading Ukraine was an unforgivable remark by the leader of a country which had killed civilians in conflicts across the world. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands, displaced more than 3 million and raised fears of a wider confrontation between Russia and the United States, the world's two biggest nuclear powers. In an exchange with a reporter on Wednesday, Biden said, ""Oh I think he is a war criminal,"" after initially responding with a ""no"" to a question about whether he was ready to call Putin that. ""Our president is a very wise, prescient and cultured international figure and head of the Russian Federation, our head of state,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said when asked about Biden's remark. ""Such statements by Mr Biden are absolutely impermissible, unacceptable and unforgivable,"" Peskov said. ""The main thing is that the head of a state which has for many years bombed people across the world... the president of such a country has no right to make such statements."" Peskov said the United States had bombed defeated Japan in 1945, destroying the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Japan surrendered six days later, ending World War Two. Around 200,000 people were killed instantly by the bombs and many more died from radiation sickness. MIGHT OF RUSSIA Russia warned the United States on Thursday that Moscow had the might to put the world's pre-eminent superpower in its place and accused the West of stoking a wild Russophobic plot to tear Russia apart. Dmitry Medvedev, who served as president from 2008 to 2012 and is now deputy secretary of Russia's Security Council, said the United States had stoked ""disgusting"" Russophobia in an attempt to force Russia to its knees. ""It will not work - Russia has the might to put all of our brash enemies in their place,"" Medvedev said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, the United States and its European and Asian allies have slapped sanctions on Russian leaders, companies and businessmen, cutting off Russia from much of the world economy. Putin says that what he calls the special military operation in Ukraine was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia, and Russia had to defend against the ""genocide"" of Russian-speaking people by Kyiv. Ukraine says it is fighting for its existence and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. The West says claims it wants to rip Russia apart are fiction. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told European Union lawmakers on Wednesday that they should recognise Putin as a war criminal. Russia says that despite sanctions it can fare well without what it casts as a deceitful and decadent West and that it will develop ties with other powers such as China.

3/18/2022,"The Marine Corps' top officer had high praise for Ukrainian forces Wednesday as he discussed the invasion of the country by Russia. ""I would begin first of all with Ukraine, and how well their forces are doing,"" Marine Corps Commandant Gen. David Berger said while speaking to Washington Post reporter David Ignatius on a webcast. ""I think they're proving to be very disciplined, very well trained, very well led, and now very inspired,"" Berger added. Specifically, the Marine leader noted that the country is winning ""the information competition."" Read Next: Woman Charged with Posing as Wounded Marine Corps Veteran The conflict, now in its third week, has been marked by a stalled advancement of Russian troops in recent days, according to Pentagon assessments. ""Fighting continues around major cities, major bombing, but no appreciable gains by Russia in recent days,"" a senior defense official told reporters Wednesday. Berger noted that the Russian forces have not been effective at ""fighting combined arms"" -- using infantry and armor units to complement each other. Though the Marine general noted that it's not clear why Russian forces have not been implementing these tactics, he floated the possibility that it's driven by how well the Ukrainians are denying the invading force any reconnaissance opportunities. ""If you're a Russian tactical commander right now, on the ground, I'm not sure they have a good picture of what's in front of them,"" he said. Berger also noted that Ukrainian forces have successfully made resupplying Russian troops very challenging by having units take ""individual initiative"" to get at Russia's ""backside, at [their] logistics trains."" ""That really causes Russian tactical leaders more problems because the resupply that they were planning now has to fight its way to get to you from Russia,"" he said. Exacerbating Russia's supply woes could also be an inflexible command structure ""where junior leaders are not allowed, not permitted to make those kind of calls"" that permit forces to change tactics on the fly, Berger explained. When asked why the Russians hadn't assaulted Ukraine from the Black Sea, the leader of the military branch that specializes in amphibious assaults noted that ""no other operation that I know of is more complicated, more complex, takes more preparation, practice, rehearsal than an amphibious operation."" ""Which is why not all forces can do them,"" Berger was quick to add. He suggested that ""Ukrainian forces had time to set a defense along the coastline that caused them, the Russian forces, to be concerned and delay"" -- a sentiment echoed by others at the Pentagon. One senior defense official told reporters last week that the one amphibious landing conducted by Russian forces occurred where it ""was not going to be contested because they don't have a lot of amphibious experience, and there was no great air support for that amphibious landing."" ""It's hard stuff for us, and I think what we're seeing over the last couple of weeks is just how much harder it is for the Russian military,"" that official added. Berger noted that ""during a conflict, it's difficult to draw all of the deeper lessons learned,"" but added that the war will continue to be studied by both U.S. and foreign militaries. ""We should assume that [Chinese navy] leaders are studying what's happening in Ukraine,"" he said. ""I think it should definitely give them pause about any degree of confidence an assault, an invasion of another country ... especially if it's across a body of water, is not going to be easy and it's not going to be quick."" -- Konstantin Toropin can be reached at konstantin.toropin@military.com.

3/18/2022,"Congress passed a bill last week explicitly prohibiting federal law enforcement officers from having sex with people in their custody, closing a loophole that previously allowed them to avoid a rape conviction by claiming such an encounter was consensual. The legal loophole gained widespread attention in 2018, after an 18-year-old woman in New York, Anna Chambers, said that two detectives raped her inside their police van. The detectives, who have since resigned, said she consented. Prosecutors ultimately dropped the sexual assault charges, and the men were sentenced to five years of probation after pleading guilty to bribery and official misconduct. In February 2018, BuzzFeed News reported that laws in 35 states allowed police officers to claim that a person in their custody consented to sex, and that of at least 158 law enforcement officers charged with sexual assault, sexual battery, or unlawful sexual contact with somebody under their control from 2006 to 2018, at least 26 were acquitted or had charges dropped based on the consent defense. “I think there was uniform recognition that this was egregious,” said the act’s lead sponsor, Rep. Jackie Speier, who said that she first learned of the legal loophole from the BuzzFeed News story. “It shocked the consciousness.” In the months following the story’s publication, six states changed their police sexual misconduct laws to bar officers from claiming consensual sex with a detainee: New York, Maryland, Kansas, New Hampshire, Illinois, and Vermont. Speier was among the Congress members who proposed a similar law at the federal level in July 2018, but it was part of a wider bill that didn’t pass due to disputes over other proposals, such as expanding restrictions on gun access for people convicted of domestic violence offenses. Last week, though, the Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act passed the House and Senate as part of a broader appropriations bill. The act also requires states that receive certain federal grants to annually report to the Department of Justice the number of complaints alleging a sexual encounter between a local law enforcement officer and a person in their custody. “Over the course of three years it became law,” Speier said in an interview. “And you should take credit for it.” While laws in all states bar probation officers and prison and jail guards from having sex with people who are incarcerated, most state legal codes don’t include police officers in the language of their sexual abuse provisions, nor specify that sexual encounters between law enforcement agents and people in their custody cannot be consensual, according to a 2018 BuzzFeed News review of state criminal laws. In most of the states that do not explicitly outlaw sex between on-duty cops and detainees, an officer can claim consent and face only a misdemeanor “official misconduct” charge, which carries a maximum one-year sentence. Before Chambers’ case brought renewed scrutiny on New York’s rape statute, law enforcement loopholes existed without controversy in most states, partly because few people realized they existed and partly because it has been politically unpopular to push laws that target cops and anger their powerful unions. But even by then, some states had closed their loophole: Oregon did so in 2005, Alaska in 2013, and Arizona in 2015. The Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act applies to the 100,000 or so law enforcement officers across all federal agencies, but not to state and local authorities. The loophole remains in place in a majority of states. An 18-Year-Old Said She Was Raped While In Police Custody.

3/18/2022,"(Adds quotes) LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia would achieve its goals in Ukraine and would not submit to what he called a Western attempt to achieve global dominance and dismember Russia. Putin said Russia was ready to discuss neutral status for Ukraine, three weeks into a war that has killed thousands of people and forced millions of Ukrainians to flee their homes. He said that what Russia calls its special military operation was ""going to plan"". In a televised speech to government ministers, Putin went further than before in acknowledging the pain that Western sanctions were inflicting on the economy, but insisted that Russia could withstand the blow. There was no sign of any softening in his bitter invective against the West and Ukraine. ""In the foreseeable future, it was possible that the pro-Nazi regime in Kyiv could have got its hands on weapons of mass destruction, and its target, of course, would have been Russia,"" Putin said. Putin has consistently described the democratically elected leaders of Ukraine as neo-Nazis bent on committing genocide against Russian-speakers in the east of the country - a line that the West denounces as baseless war propaganda. He said Western countries wanted to turn Russia into a ""weak dependent country; violate its territorial integrity; to dismember Russia in a way that suits them"". If the West thought that Russia would break down or back down, ""they don't know our history or our people"", Putin said on the 21st day of the war. ""Behind the hypocritical talk and today's actions of the so-called collective West are hostile geopolitical goals. They just don't want a strong and sovereign Russia."" He said Russia was ready to discuss Ukraine's neutral status in talks: ""The question of principle for our country and its future – the neutral status of Ukraine, its demilitarisation, and its denazification – we were ready and we are ready to discuss as part of negotiations."" Ukraine says it is willing to negotiate to end the war but will not surrender or accept Russian ultimatums. In his most explicit acknowledgment of the pain inflicted by Western sanctions, Putin said inflation and unemployment would rise, and structural changes to the economy would be needed. But he promised support to families with children. He said the West had in effect declared Russia in default as part of its sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine, but that the conflict had been only a pretext for the West to impose those sanctions. ""The West doesn't even bother to hide that their aim is to damage the entire Russian economy, every Russian,"" Putin said.
