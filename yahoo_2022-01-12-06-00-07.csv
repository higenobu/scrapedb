1/12/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking, but still has two perjury charges pending against her. Prosecutors said they're prepared to dismiss those charges if she doesn't get a retrial. Maxwell's defense lawyers asked for a retrial after a juror disclosed his own experience as a sexual abuse victim. Prosecutors have offered to drop two pending perjury charges against convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell if last month's guilty verdict holds up. ""In the event the defendant's post-trial motions are denied, the Government is prepared to dismiss the severed perjury counts at the time of sentencing, in light of the victims' significant interests in bringing closure to this matter and avoiding the trauma of testifying again,"" prosecutors wrote in a joint letter filed to court Monday night. A jury found Maxwell guilty of five of the sex child-sex-trafficking charges brought against her in December. But the verdict is now in jeopardy, after a juror told members of the media that he was sexually abused as a child and discussed this experience during jury deliberations. Juror #50 — who spoke publicly under his first and middle name, Scotty David — did not appear to have disclosed his experience on a juror questionnaire, and the judge did not question him about it during the voir dire part of jury selection. According to The Daily Mail, Maxwell's attorneys believe at least three jurors did not disclose their experiences with sexual abuse on the juror forms. Maxwell's attorneys argued the juror's disclosure warrants a retrial, which many legal experts believe is likely. They have also asked that all the jurors in the case be questioned about David, who could face criminal charges if he lied while filling out his juror form. In the joint letter, Maxwell's attorneys said a sentencing hearing shouldn't be scheduled and that Maxwell should not participate in a sentencing report until the juror issue is resolved. ""Requiring Ms. Maxwell to participate in the preparation of the Presentence Investigation Report, while she is awaiting a decision on her motion for a new trial, will adversely impact her Fifth Amendment rights,"" they wrote. ""Ms. Maxwell will be forced into the position of not cooperating with the Probation Department's investigation because any statement she makes to Probation, and any documents she provides, may be used against her at her retrial."" US District Judge Alison Nathan, who's overseeing the case, last week ordered prosecutors and defense attorneys to file letters briefing her on the juror issue over the next month. David has hired the attorney Todd Spodek, best known for representing the fake heiress Anna Sorokin, to represent him in the proceedings. In addition to the six charges Maxwell has already been tried on, prosecutors also brought two perjury charges against her in 2019. They alleged she lied in a deposition about her knowledge of and participation in disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein's scheme to recruit and sexually abuse underage women, and of her own participation in the abuse. The deposition was taken for a civil lawsuit against Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who has accused Maxwell and Epstein of sexual misconduct. Giuffre was not brought as a witness in Maxwell's criminal trial. Prosecutors initially planned to request a schedule for a trial on the perjury charges following the verdict on the sex-trafficking charges. In the joint letter, they asked for a sentencing hearing to be held in April or May, and for the judge to dismiss the perjury counts at that time. A representative for Giuffre declined to comment to Insider. A representative for Giuffre's attorneys did not immediately respond Tuesday to Insider's request for comment.

1/12/2022,"Dr. Anthony Fauci slammed Sen. Rand Paul on Tuesday for encouraging threats on his life by mounting vociferous public attacks “with not a shred of evidence,” telling the Kentucky Republican that he was “incorrect in almost everything you say.” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was testifying at a hearing held by the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, when Paul, an ophthalmologist by training, used his allotted five minutes to go after Fauci’s credibility. The hearing also included CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock, and Dawn O’Connell, assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, who were questioned by lawmakers about the federal government’s response to new COVID-19 variants. Paul has regularly trafficked in bizarre conspiracy theories regarding COVID. Earlier this year, he insisted that public health officials were discounting the use of folk remedies such as hydroxychloroquine, which has not been proven to work at all against COVID, and ivermectin—a drug used to treat head lice and intestinal parasites—because of their “hatred” for ex-President Donald Trump. As hospitalizations rose in Paul’s home state of Kentucky, he urged Americans to ignore CDC guidelines and “anti-science mask mandates,” which have been proven to reduce transmission of the virus. And over the summer, Paul claimed without any proof that Democrats were taking migrant children from border areas and “putting them all over the United States” to “seed the country with a new variant.” Dr. Fauci Torches Rand Paul: ‘You Do Not Know What You’re Talking About!’ During his time at the Tuesday hearing, Paul described Fauci as someone who “would claim unilaterally to represent science and that any criticism of you would be considered a criticism of science itself,” calling it “quite dangerous.” Paul was referring to an internal CDC email in which Fauci questioned the findings of certain studies he viewed as “fringe.” “A planner who believes he is the science leads to an arrogance that justifies in his mind using government resources to smear and to destroy the reputations of other scientists who disagree with him,” Paul said. “Do you think it’s appropriate to use your $420,000 salary to attack scientists that disagree with you?” Fauci replied, “That’s not what went on. There you go again. You do the same thing every hearing.” But beyond simply misinforming the public, Fauci pointed out that Paul’s rhetoric has real-life consequences. “So the last time we had a committee or the time before he was accusing me of being responsible for the death of 4 to 5 million people which is irresponsible,” Fauci said. “Why is he doing that? … The first is, it distracts from what we’re all trying to do here today, is get our arms around the epidemic and pandemic we’re dealing with, not something imaginary. Number two, what happens when he gets out and accuses me of things that are completely untrue, is that all of a sudden that kindles the crazies out there and I have threats upon my life, harassment of my family, and my children, with obscene phone calls because people are lying about me.” Conservative Activist Dies of COVID Complications After Attending Anti-Vax ‘Symposium’  Fauci admitted that he could “take the hit,” because “that’s the way it goes.” However, he noted that a man who was recently caught by police with an AR-15 and “multiple magazines of ammunition“ allegedly told investigators he was on his way to Washington, D.C. “to kill Dr. Fauci.” “So I asked myself, ‘Why would the senator want to do this?” Fauci continued. “Go to Rand Paul’s website and you see: ‘Fire Dr. Fauci,’ with a little box that says, ‘Contribute here.’ You can do $5, $10, $20, $100. You are milking a catastrophic epidemic for your political gain.” Paul’s reelection website alleges that Fauci, who was at the leading edge of AIDS research for decades, “has abandoned science and embraced theatrics at the expense of our freedom.” Before asking for donations, Paul’s website says Fauci has been “lying about everything from masks to the contagiousness of the virus,” and calls for him to be fired. “I have a great deal of respect for this body of the Senate, and it makes me very uncomfortable to have to say something [like this], but he is egregiously incorrect in what he says,” Fauci said.

1/12/2022,"A 37-year-old Black man was shot and killed in the street outside of his home in North Carolina by an off-duty sheriff’s deputy over the weekend in an incident that has sparked protests in the town of Fayetteville amid swirling claims about what led to the deadly confrontation. The Fayetteville Observer reported that around 2:15 p.m. on Jan. 8, Jason Walker lost his life outside of his Bingham Drive home after an encounter in the roadway with a pickup-driving off-duty deputy with the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office. A statement from the Fayetteville Police Department initially alleged that Walker “ran into traffic and jumped on a moving vehicle” before Deputy Jeffrey Hash shot him. After the shooting, Hash called 911 to report the incident. Witnesses say the deputy did not move to help save the man’s life after he was shot, but rather called his higher-ups in the sheriff’s department. Elizabeth Ricks got out of her vehicle to try and save Walker by applying pressure to his wounds. Ricks said instead of trying to help, the deputy called the sheriff’s office. The following day Ricks spoke to a crowd at a Fayetteville rally in support of Walker, where she told them she witnessed Walker attempting to cross the street, presumably to get to his home, before he was hit by the pickup truck, after which the deputy shot him. The News & Observer newspaper quoted the trauma nurse as saying of Walker: “I did not see anyone in distress. The man was just walking home.” “It breaks my heart he didn’t survive, and I’m trying to cope with that as well,” she said at a march on Sunday in protest of Walker’s death. “I don’t want to take away from Jason or the injustice, and I’m not going to be silent.” Reportedly, two people who claimed to be witnesses said on social media that they saw the deputy hit Walker with his pickup truck as he was crossing the street and then shoot him. Video of the shooting was posted to social media almost four hours later, seemingly starting right after the incident. What can be discerned from the video is that a man in a red pickup truck is on the phone, while two women and a different man are trying to help a man lying on the ground. “I don’t know where the entry point is he won’t tell me where he shot him,” a woman can be heard saying. “I’m trying to protect my daughter and my wife,” Deputy Hash says on the phone to someone. “People are hostile right now.” As sirens blaze louder and louder, one of the witnesses runs over to him and says, the video records, “Nobody is hostile. Don’t you (expletive) say that. Nobody is hostile.” When two FPD officers arrived on the scene, they tried to help Walker, noticing that his pulse was faint. The cops asked if anyone saw what happened and collected statements. A preliminary investigation revealed that Hash’s shot was not fired through the windshield and that its wiper was torn off. The report noted that the metal portion of the wiper was used to break the windshield of the truck in multiple spots. At a news conference on Sunday, Fayetteville Police Chief Gina Hawkins clarified rumors about the incident. One thing she noted was that the pickup truck had a “black box” that would have registered if the vehicle struck “any person or thing.” She also said that there was only one eyewitness, who has told law enforcement that Walker was not hit by the truck. Since the incident, the North Carolina Bureau of Investigation has been brought on to review Hash’s conduct. Though the FBI has been notified, the agency was not tapped to join the investigation. However, the FBI Public Affairs Specialist, Shelley Lynch shared with ABC 11, “We are aware of the shooting death investigation in Fayetteville and are in regular contact with local and state authorities. If, in the course of the North Carolina SBI investigation, information comes to light of a potential federal violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate.” On Jan. 10, the Cumberland County Sheriff’s office released a statement saying that Hash has been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation. Hash has served in the county’s law enforcement branch since 2005 and is now a lieutenant in the civil section of the department. Cumberland County District Attorney Billy West announced on Sunday that his office is recusing itself from the investigation to avoid appearance of a conflict of interest. The probe will be handled by the North Carolina Conference of District Attorneys. BREAKING: Cumberland Sheriff’s office identifies the deputy who shot and killed Jason Walker in Fayetteville on Saturday. CCSO says deputy Jeffrey Hash has been placed on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated. @WRAL pic.twitter.com/l3Kj2vqiIs — Keenan Willard (@KeenanWRAL) January 10, 2022 On behalf of the sheriff’s office, Lieutenant Patrice Bogertey, the Public Information Officer, offered remarks to the family, saying, “Our sincere condolences go out to Jason Walker’s family.” The family has said to the press that they do not believe what has been reported about their loved one’s death. “I don’t believe he threw himself on top of a truck,” Walker’s cousin stated. “I believe he wanted to live. I just want justice for my cousin because it’s not adding up.” Walker is survived by a son.
