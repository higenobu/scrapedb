1/31/2022,"Leah Swift, an 18-year-old college student in West Virginia, bought her first Squishmallow in October 2020. Less than two years later, she has amassed 350 of the cute, cuddly toys, which overflow from the shelves of her small bedroom. Swift regularly posts videos about her vast collection on TikTok, where she’s garnered nearly 400,000 followers and 11m likes.  “It’s gotten to the point where people will stop me on campus and ask if I am the Squishmallow girl from TikTok,” she said. “It’s crazy. When I started making these videos, I never thought it would be this big of a deal.” Squishmallows, a line of whimsical and rounded stuffed creatures launched by the toy company Kellytoy in 2017, have boomed in popularity in recent years. Much like Beanie Babies in the 1990s, the toys have sparked a fanatical following of Squishmallow “hunters” who flock to stores in search of new and rare models. But the craze has also been beset by controversy, as rising demand fuels a pricey black market for Squishmallow resales. Resellers report making as much as six figures a year buying up and flipping the toys, which critics say is stripping shelves bare for genuine collectors. Now, Squishmallow influencers like Swift have found themselves pulled into a debate over the etiquette of buying and reselling the toys. Swift bought her first Squishmallow, a strawberry-shaped toy named Scarlet, for just $5. The same model now goes for as much as $25 on resale sites like Depop and Mercari. Swift estimates she could resell her collection for about $3,000 total – but would not dream of it. “I am against reselling Squishmallows for any more than their retail value,” she said. “There are people who get into the space for all the wrong reasons, and it is having a very negative impact on the community.” When a user named Juliana Lynn posted a video in December 2021 claiming to have made $100,000 in the last year from resales, her page was flooded with negative comments from people who say resales drive up prices and undermine true hobbyists. “This disgusts me. People like you ruin it for kids/people that genuinely enjoy them,” one comment said. “You’re a shelf clearing price gouger,” another read. “Just so you know the people in the Squish community despise ppl like you.” Lynn did not respond to multiple requests for comment but defended herself on her own page, calling it a “side hustle” and nothing more. “I don’t do this for attention,” she wrote. “I do it for fun and extra cash.” Despite the debate over reselling, the trend shows no sign of slowing down. Kellytoy sold 50m Squishmallows betewen February 2020 and October 2021, according to the toy trade publication the Toy Book – bringing the total number sold to over 100m since their launch. Largely fueled by social media, platforms like Instagram, Reddit and TikTok now host Squishmallow communities comprising thousands of users. But the meteoric rise has prompted some to consider quitting the scene altogether. Melanie Schroeder, a California-based college student, started collecting in August 2020 and now has 400 toys, but she says the price gouging has overshadowed the hobby’s originally playful nature. “Unfortunately a lot of people are no longer collecting because they are so tired of resellers clearing shelves and price gouging,” she said. “It takes a lot of the fun out of it.” While Schroeder is personally against resale, she has found other ways to cash in on her new hobby, having signed up for TikTok’s creator fund after her Squishmallow TikTok account blew up in recent months, amassing more than 400,000 likes. Influencers on the platform can make as much as $50 per video depending on its view count. Schroeder attributes the huge rise in Squishmallow popularity to upheaval brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic and its emotional impact – particularly among young people. “For me personally, if I am sad, I go Squish hunting,” she said. “They’re so squishy and cuddly and cute and have brought so much comfort and joy to people through the last couple of years.”",Lifestyle/Life and style, Squishmallows: cuddly toys fuel an obsession – and a price-gouging crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/30/squishmallows-toys-collecting
1/31/2022,"One of Queensland’s largest independent schools has sent families enrolment contracts that include asking them to sign a statement that states “homosexual acts” are immoral, listing them along with bestiality, incest and paedophilia as “offensive to God”. The “statement of faith” required for enrolment at Citipointe Christian College also includes statements that imply transgender students will be recognised only by their “biological sex” at the school – that students should identify “with the gender that God bestowed”.  Citipointe is widely considered Brisbane’s equivalent of the Sydney megachurch Hillsong. Initially the “Christian Outreach Centre”, the church has satellite ministries in Nashville, Auckland and central Bulgaria. Like Hillsong, it has its own Christian music operation, Citipointe Worship. The school, which occupies part of Citipointe’s extensive campus in the Brisbane suburb of Carindale, claims on its website to be “one of Queensland’s largest independent schools, with a student population of over 1720”. A petition demanding the school recall the enrolment contracts, which parents must sign, had more than 30,000 signatures on Monday morning. One parent said they had expressed concern with the school and been told that the contract was compulsory for enrolment. A parent at a neighbouring school said she had written to her principal asking for a boycott of inter-school sport against Citipointe. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The “statement of faith” section in the Citipointe college enrolment contracts is an excerpt from the constitution of the Christian Outreach Centre. It states that: “We believe that God intends sexual intimacy to occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other”. “We believe that any form of sexual immorality (including but not limited to: adultery, fornication, homosexual acts, bisexual acts, bestiality, incest, paedophilia and pornography) is sinful and offensive to God and is destructive to human relationships and society. “We believe that God created human beings as male or female.” The contract also states that “I/we agree that, where distinctions are made between male and female (inclusive of, but not limited to, for example, uniforms, presentation, terminology, use of facilities and amenities, participation in sporting events and accommodation) such distinctions will be applied on the basis of the individual’s biological sex.” The office of the school principal, pastor Brian Mulheran, said he was not available to answer questions on Monday. Mulheran – who in 2012 claimed he was totally cured from a long-term debilitating sickness by the prayer of a healing pastor – said in a statement that the school does not judge students on their sexuality or gender identity and a decision about their enrolment would not be made on that basis. “We have always held these Christian beliefs and we have tried to be fair and transparent to everyone in our community by making them clear in the enrolment contract,” Mulheran said. “We are seeking to maintain our Christian ethos and to give parents and students the right to make an informed choice about whether they can support and embrace our approach to Christian education. “We believe each individual is created in the image of God, with dignity and worth equal to every other person. We unequivocally love and respect all people regardless of their lifestyle and choices, even if those choices are different to our beliefs and practice.”",News/Australia news,Queensland school requires families to denounce homosexuality during enrolment ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/31/offensive-to-god-queensland-school-requires-families-to-denounce-homosexuality-during-enrolment
