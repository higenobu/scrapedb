5/1/2022,"May: the month of hope. The time of higher temperatures and longer days. But be wary of cooler soil. The rush to sow seed is strong. Try to slow down a little longer until you are sure in places where cold can linger. That said, of course, the sowing list is long. May is your last chance to plant potatoes and sow sweet peas. Spinach is now or best to wait until late summer. It is a good time to sow a flower patch, if you have room. As before, I go to Higgledy Garden for guidance and seed. Ben’s grandad’s best advice: ‘Never sow seeds into the ground unless you would sit on that ground with a bare bum.’ Time, too, to get in corn. Sown in blocks, not rows, for best germination. We will be growing Painted Mountain corn from central Ukrainian organic and heritage seed supplier, Organicseeds.top. Though be warned, there may be a wait for your order as the conflict has put an end to airmail. May is the month to create a summer herb bed where it is warm enough. We’ll sow chervil, coriander, parsley. We’ll also be growing lots of dill (though, to be fair, we’ve never had much success). You should be able to sow root crops: carrots, beets, turnips, parsnips. Leaves, too: the kales, chards, mustard greens, even autumn and winter cabbages. Salads: lettuces, the rockets, and land cress. Remember, too, to offer water and feed for birds, if you can. They may be nesting. Also keep an eye on ponds. If all this talk of seed seems slow or you just feel the need for more plants, then garden centres and some farmers’ markets should be stocked with vegetable seedlings now. Lastly, remember to weed and water, keep a wary eye out for greenfly, blackfly, other aphids, caterpillars, slugs and snails. It is a small price to pay. Happy May days.

5/1/2022,"The Alan, 18 Princess Street, Manchester M1 4LG (0161 236 8999). Snacks and small plates £3-£6.50, steaks and chops £16-£28, desserts £7, wines from £25 First impressions matter. First impressions can also be wrong. The first impression tonight at the Alan, a new boutique hotel on the edge of Manchester’s Chinatown, is of somewhere about as popular as herpes. The moodily lit foyer is a confection of raw brick and rough plastered walls, housing stone slab tables of the sort Aslan might be sacrificed upon if you were in need of a little light midcourse religious symbolism. There’s ceiling ducting and spindly industrial lighting and acres of polished crazy paving-style stone floor. And almost no punters. The Alan isn’t just quiet. It feels abandoned. A single employee is on duty in the main foyer this evening, eyeing the entrance. He greets us cheerfully as we push through the doors. Perhaps he’s grateful for the company. To the right is the dining area. There’s a square, open kitchen, edged by a low counter. It houses three earnest-looking cooks. You can watch them at work while you eat, but tonight nobody is doing so. They are cooking for just a couple of tables. Granted, it’s a Tuesday night, but currently there aren’t that many options in Manchester on a Tuesday night. I should know. I’m in town for a turn in Dictionary Corner on Countdown, constantly hoping to find an esoteric word from the nine available letters to make me look clever. (Esoteric would be a great eight-letter find.) It’s an opportunity to review, so I’ve scoped out the options, but perhaps because of ever-present staff shortages the available candidates, both obvious and less so, are not open on a Monday and Tuesday. But hey, there’s the Alan, which is new. And empty. Something must be up. Alternatively, it’s just a quiet school night. Let’s go with that, with a side order of “they don’t know what they’re missing”. Because right now the kitchen of the Alan, led by chef Iain Thomas, is cooking a truly delightful and admirably tight menu of diverting dishes, which reveal their joys a little at a time. And all at a price positioned to comfort rather than terrorise (nine letters, but you’re unlikely to get three “r”s). Money has clearly been spent on this development, which is apparently designed to celebrate and revive the existing materials in this once industrial building. If so, they’re not attempting to recoup that investment from the parade of small plates on offer. They top out at £6.50; the steaks and chops, sourced from the highly regarded Butcher’s Quarter in the north of the city, are a bargain, too. We begin, for £3.50, with a tidily arranged pile of vinegared anchovies (nine letters), their silvery skins glinting up at us, zhuzhed (great seven-letter Countdown word, if you had two zeds) with Amalfi lemon, decorated with fronds of green herbs and resting in a puddle of peppery olive oil. We get a plate of blistered flatbreads and politely introduce one to the other. Pearly cubes of halibut ceviche, tasting both of citrus and surf, come with burnt orange and the lightly bitter joys of chicory. Hispi cabbage has been broken up into its individual leaves and then heaped with friable pieces of long-braised lamb shoulder. Celeriac has first been salt-baked unto a buttery softness (eight letters). It comes with a soothing celeriac purée, and a crunchy, truffled crumb. My only grumble is with their take on imam bayildi. Halved and roasted baby aubergines are laid on a tomato and garlic purée, with lots more of the by now familiar green herbs. The purée is nice enough, but the aubergine is just a little dry and tough. Perhaps head for the baba ganoush from the snacks menu, if aubergine action is what you’re after. From the Butcher’s Quarter menu, we share a perfectly cooked pork chop, pre-sliced to reveal the pink and to help avoid steak knives at dawn. It’s a steal at £16, and beautifully presented in the shape of a fan of the sort a Victorian lady might have favoured, had fans made of quality grilled pig been her thing. We have a side of their chard brassicas (terrific nine-letter word) showered with grated lemon zest to make us feel good about ourselves, and a bowl of their chips, because we deserve them on account of the brassicas. Life is all about balance isn’t it? Talking of sprouts (kind of) we have a lovely chat to our eager waiter, partly to stop him asking how everything is, less because he’s been trained to do so, but because he seems genuinely interested. He’s studying music business at university in the city and also has a band influenced by 80s greats “like Prefab Sprout”. I both admire his taste and feel very, very old. Come for the small plates; stay for dessert, because the short list includes an Arctic roll. Great, isn’t it? I’m a seemingly sophisticated, urbane 55-year-old man. Across the years I have gone into full culinary swoon mode over the finest of Parisian chocolate work or recreations of bird’s cages in golden spun sugar enclosing a wild strawberry millefeuille. It turns out that all I really wanted was a seriously well-made Arctic roll with a scoop of blackberry ice-cream, to remind me gently of what it was to once have been an easily pleased seven-year-old. It has been left out of the fridge long enough so that the sponge has softened, and the edges of the vanilla ice-cream filling have just begun to melt. If that wasn’t enough, now they bring what they call a Snickers (eight letters, but I don’t think names are allowed): a broad cylinder of an airy milk chocolate mousse with, at its centre, a generous dollop of dulce de leche, alongside candied peanuts and topped by a scoop of ice-cream. These are proper desserts that have required care, consideration and a childlike glee. They cost £7 each. The wine list is short, just five whites and reds, but at least they are all available by the glass. A couple of other tables have come and gone during the evening but it really has remained quiet. However, there is now a solo diner at the counter, being entertained by the brigade who seem grateful for the company. The Alan is a hotel restaurant with which you can be on first-name terms. Right now though, it needs a few more pals. Not least because what is going on here is thoroughly alluring. And that’s a solid eight-letter word. My work here is done. Four big-name chefs are coming together on 10 May to cook a dinner raising funds for the #cookforukraine appeal. Tickets for the four-course dinner at Pino, on London’s Kensington High Street, cost £85. The menu includes steak tartare with an asparagus and pecorino salad by Henry Harris of the much-missed Racine, nettle and borage ravioli by Allegra McEvedy of Albertine, a casserole of brill and morels by Rick Stein, and a ginger tart with rhubarb by Rowley Leigh. For tickets, visit pinobar.co.uk. The Owl gastropub, which first opened in Kirkgate Market, Leeds, in 2019, is relocating. It will reopen on 28 May on a site that’s twice the size of the original within the Mustard Wharf residential development, by the River Aire to the east of the city centre. The last service at the current location will be on 21 May (theowlleeds.co.uk). Margot Henderson of Rochelle Canteen is going into the pub business. She has taken over the Three Horseshoes in the Somerset village of Batcombe and will reopen it as a food pub with five bedrooms in November. Expect a menu of devilled crab and focaccia, chicken and tarragon pie, grilled brill, fennel, chard and green sauce with a Somerset apple crumble, custard tarts and local cheeses with cobnuts to finish.

5/1/2022,"The question My friend has been unwell for a year. She is convinced her neighbours are trying to damage her property and trying to get all the locals against her. She installed CCTV cameras, then became agoraphobic and, although she managed to go back to work, she remains suspicious of everyone. She is stuck with her anger about her neighbours ruining her life and not wanting to give up her house although she has never been happy there. I am not sure how to help her any more. I thought that I did not want to challenge her beliefs as she felt alienated enough, but part of me wants to say that I do not think that the neighbours would bother to follow her everywhere, convince hundreds of people to monitor her moves, tap her mobile or persuade people at work to cough at her “to make her think she is mad”. My approach was to say the neighbours are not nice (they have never been) and she needs to find a place where she feels safe and to sort out her mental health as it has been affected by the bad relationship with her neighbours, a divorce and lockdown. I would appreciate your advice. I know she is poorly and needs support, but I am not sure how to help her. Philippa’s answer I cannot save you from anxiety about your friend, but let me see what I can do – although I should warn you it will be woefully inadequate – which is what I fear you will have to be, too. Accepting our own limits and uselessness is a necessary lesson sometimes. You appear sensitive and sensible and sound like a great asset to her. I guess that being on her own and feeling that she is surrounded by hostility has pushed her into paranoid delusions. Why do we humans have a propensity to tip over into this state? I speculate it is because even though believing that everyone is out to get us feels scary, it is more comfortable – more survivable – than believing that we are invisible and count for nothing in everybody’s mind. Because, if no one knows whether we are breathing or not, we might as well cease to exist and, for many of us, this is terrifying. Therefore, convincing yourself that they are all out to get you becomes a handy defence mechanism. What I’m saying is that paranoid delusions are often, in my humble and flexible opinion, an unconscious reflex to defend against not mattering to anyone, which makes us feel very unsafe. Having delusions means that her fear finds an outlet that she can cope with, whatever her original fear is – probably that of not mattering to anyone – she doesn’t have to face it if her mind comes up with a delusion instead, and her delusion (that she matters so much that the whole world is conspiring against her) would be easier for her to live with than total insignificance. Phobias are a similar phenomenon, only in the case of a phobia we know we are being irrational. When you are phobic about something, you know you are being neurotic, but with paranoid delusions you are in a more serious psychotic state. Both conditions make you less able to connect with others, but a psychosis makes you difficult to reach as well, because your subjective experience differs so wildly from everyone else’s. This lack of connection matters because the people around us are like mirrors in which we see ourselves. How people respond to us works as a sort of system of checks and balances for our mental health. The long lockdowns have played havoc with our minds. When every person is a probable source of infection and death we grow wary, especially of strangers. The pandemic made everyone a bit neurotic. Cognitively, we might know we would be missed if we disappeared, but our bodily experience of being isolated can trigger a fear state and then the brain comes up with narratives to make sense of it. In your friend’s case, her neighbours were experienced as hostile and they were probably the only people she saw. She is sensitive. You cannot be scolded out of sensitivity. You are doing the right thing by understanding, listening, being available. Having calm people around her will be the best thing. At the moment, you are not challenging her, but not colluding either, so you are actually doing great. You sound as though you are being sensitive and your intuition of what she can take by way of challenge is probably good. If you could persuade her to see a psychiatrist that would be ideal, but couch it in terms of getting a professional person on her side, rather than telling her she’s mad. I don’t like thinking of people as mad, I prefer human, because if we had her constitution and environment and experiences, we would all be liable to fall into the same hole. Seeing a professional is desirable as she may be at risk of suicide. I hope if I ever fall down the hole she has fallen down, I have someone like you in my life. Short answer: you are doing great.

5/1/2022," We referred to Labour potentially “winning its first byelection victory since 2012” (Tory MP convicted of sexually molesting boy, 15, fails to keep his promise to resign, 24 April, p7). The party has held a number of seats at byelections in the past decade; we meant this would be its first victory in taking a seat from another party.  An article (Minister plans review of impact of gender dysphoria treatment, 24 April, p9) said the interim Cass report on NHS gender identity services had found that “some staff” felt under pressure to adopt an unquestioning affirmative approach to children concerned about their gender. To clarify, that finding related to “primary and secondary care staff”, not those at the Gender Identity Development Service, the specialist provider for England and Wales run by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust.  The memorial service for the Observer columnist Katharine Whitehorn took place on 19 April, not 18 April, as an article suggested in referring to “last Monday” (Notebook, 24 April, p42). And the first name of Rev Dr Ifode-Blease, who led the service, is Mariama, not Mariam.  Germany’s economics minister is Robert Habeck, not “Halbeck” (A divided France and a Germany unsure of its identity threaten Europe’s future, 24 April, p44).

5/1/2022,"I felt a mixture of despair and anger on reading your editorial (“We’ve learned so little from these tragedies”). Twenty years ago, I was responsible for implementing the recommendations of Lord Laming’s Victoria Climbié report in a large local authority. It is inexcusable that the same poor practice decisions, lack of management supervision and inadequate resourcing continue to result in the death of vulnerable children. Laming set out numerous recommendations but, if just two of his principles were consistently followed, this would significantly reduce the risks of severe harm or death. First, children at risk should be seen in person and spoken to separately from the parent(s) at regularly intervals by a social worker. Failure to meet the agreed timescales or see the child should result in serious action. Second, directors, senior social work managers and local councillors must spend regular time with frontline child protection workers so that they understand the pressures and complexities of this work and then ensure that staff are well supported and the service adequately resourced. Providing support for vulnerable families and protecting children from harm should be treated as the highest priority for central and local government. Failure to do so is in itself a form of state neglect.Peter RiddleWirksworth, Derbyshire I sympathised with the Ingleton bakers in your article (“An honest crust? Craft bakeries rise up against ‘sourfaux’ bread”, News). The requests of the Real Bread Campaign seem reasonable. The key feature is that, to make a genuine sourdough bread, it is necessary to blend few natural ingredients and leave them fermented for much longer than other non-artisan breads. Such a process obviously has an impact on the cost. Consumers have to be fully informed about what they are buying, particularly with the growing issue of allergies.Maurizio PirriSt Albans, Hertfordshire I was sorry that in Graham Caveney’s detailed and often harrowing account of the development of his agoraphobia (“Living inside the box”, Magazine) there was no mention of the usefulness and efficacy of clinical psychology in treating this condition. My mother suffered from it for 30 years, but in her 60s was persuaded to have treatment and within a week of intensive, psychologist-led group therapy could travel on her own on public transport, walk around a lake on her own and never again took a Valium tablet. Better still for me, it dispelled her often stated belief that psychology was “the painful elaboration of the obvious”.Dr Sally CheseldineBalerno, Edinburgh In Mark Townsend’s report on delays in issuing visas to Ukrainian families (“Ukrainian refugee plan ‘designed to fail’ – insider”, News), a government source is quoted as saying, by way of explanation for the delays, that safeguarding processes were in place to protect children from trafficking. Where do you start with this? We are talking about families with children, not adults with random children picked up off Ukraine’s streets. What meaning of “safeguarding” such children validates leaving them in a war zone? These documented families will be coming by a legal route and landing at an airport, not pitching up on a beach in Kent. The time to implement safeguarding processes is when they are safely in the UK.John FilbyAshover, Derbyshire Your article about Northern Ireland and whether a win for Sinn Féin would bring a united Ireland closer makes unstated assumptions (“Future of unionism”, Focus). First, a united Ireland could only be brought about by a vote of people on both sides of the border. Since your point is that unionists and Protestants in Northern Ireland may no longer form a majority, you seem to assume that they would eventually be voted into a united Ireland. That assumes that the electorate in the republic would automatically vote for a united Ireland. In the event of an actual vote for a united Ireland, voters in the republic would start to consider at least two counterarguments against it: the added tax burden and the possibility of “importing” loyalist terrorism (the Troubles in reverse). Consider instead the following as a distinct possibility: Sinn Féin in power in both Dublin and Belfast with a referendum throughout Ireland that led to Northern Ireland remaining in the UK.Frank DesmondCork, Republic of Ireland Phillip Inman is correct (“The key to winning the climate debate isn’t economics: it’s health” (Business). Surely protection of public health should be the primary purpose of any government, although one would not think so looking at our own. As the result of global warming and air pollution, we will be unhealthier (both physically and mentally), pandemics will be more likely and health inequalities will be exacerbated. Tackling pollution must be central to “levelling up”. As we have found in the pandemic, the economy relies on good public health.Dr Stephen BattersbySurbiton, London The subject of the “Ask Philippa” column merits further discussion (“Technology makes me feel I don’t really belong in this world”, Magazine). The speed with which technology has proliferated over the past few years, accelerated by the pandemic, has created an underclass of people who no longer fit in our “advanced” society created by banks, businesses and government departments. Forms have to be completed online and it’s increasingly difficult to speak to “real” people for advice on services and benefits. There is a stratum of citizens who do not have access to technology for a number of reasons: financial, age, lack of support, inability to read/write, dyslexia, mental health issues. I am also aware of a number of people who lost access to computers when public libraries closed during the pandemic. Additionally, not everyone finds it easy to use modern technology. It is time that proper research was done to identify how many citizens are being disenfranchised in a society seemingly controlled by algorithms and business consultants and whether an underclass is becoming isolated.Phil MillsEastbourne, East Sussex Any concerns that the Observer may be increasingly pandering to the middle-class intelligentsia could only have been fuelled by some of the answers to last week’s speedy crossword, No 1,386. I am no scapegrace (17a) and accept that crosswords should be didactic (12d); however, I think they should contain words in common parlance. The speedy crossword used to be the acme (23a) of my week, but this one sent me scurrying for the shelter of my stoa (21a).

5/1/2022,"Tío Pepe en Rama 2022 release, Spain NV (from £16.50, thewinesociety.com; ocado.com; leaandsandeman.co.uk; tanners-wines.co.uk) Most wines don’t follow a particularly strict release schedule. It’s generally a matter of when the wine feels ready to go, which varies greatly according to the producer, the region, and the style they’re looking to make. But there are a few brands and styles that are very much seasonal releases. The most famous of these is without question beaujolais nouveau, which “arrives” as the old ad slogan has it, on the third Thursday of November each year. Over the past decade or so, however, wine lovers have come to anticipate another seasonal release round about now: en rama sherry. These are dry fino and manzanilla styles that are bottled directly from the barrel, unfiltered and unclarified, in the spring. The idea is that the wines have an extra level of flavour, freshness and depth at this time of the year, an assertion that certainly feels true about the magnifiencent 2022 release from Tío Pepe, a concentrated essence of salty-sourdough-savouriness. Bodegas Hidalgo Manzanilla Pasada Pastrana, Spain NV (£12.99, Waitrose) The key to the intensity of springtime-bottled en rama sherry can be found in a yeasty production quirk known as flor that marks out all fino and manzanilla sherry, en rama or otherwise. Put simply, flor is a thick layer of yeast that forms over the surface of sherry as it ages in barrel. The flor protects the sherry from oxygen, and gives fino and manzanilla sherries their distinctive Marmitey tones – flavours that are very different to those found in oloroso or the super-sweet pedro ximénez styles where the layer of flor doesn’t form. According to Tío Pepe, the 2022 release was drawn from 96 barrels at a moment – 23 March to be precise – when the flor is at its thickest, “imbuing” this sherry, as they say rather poetically, “with a wonderful salinity and bloom”. Depth, intensity and complexity in dry sherry isn’t all about bottling times, however. Bodegas Hidalgo’s superb single-vineyard manzanilla’s glorious intensity has as much to do with an extended ageing (12 years) in cask before release. Domaine Macle Côtes du Jura Tradition, Jura, France 2016 (from £45, shrinetothevine.co.uk; vinetrail.co.uk) The sherry bodegas of Jerez and nearby estuarine Sanlúcar de Barremeda (home of manzanilla) are by far the most famous exponents of flor-influenced winemaking, where the yeasty-layer brings a satisfying salty-savoury twang to even the cheapest, lightest styles, such as the briskly thirst-quenching Morrisons Fino Sherry (£5.25). But southern Spain isn’t the only place where flor flourishes. In recent years, adventurous winemakers all over the world have been inspired to cultivate their own flor, and I’ve tried successful (unfortified) examples from Chile, Argentina, California and Australia. But the place with the longest and most intriguing history of flor wine outside Andalucía is the rural eastern French region of the Jura, where vines are interspersed with pastureland for the cows that produce Comté cheese. Domaine Macle makes some of the most refined examples I’ve come across, with the dry white Tradition an elaborately complex, nutty, unfortified dry white wine that has aged for three years under the veil of yeast.

5/1/2022,"They named themselves the Ukraine Defence Consultative Group and vowed to meet monthly until the war is won. A catchier, more accurate title would be the Stop Mad Vlad Coalition. That’s surely how Russia’s friendless, paranoid president will view the US-led inaugural meeting of 40 Nato and non-Nato countries opposed to Russia’s invasion. Even embarrassed China now steers clear of Moscow’s Beria tribute act. The group’s launch was one of numerous political, rhetorical and military escalations last week – by both sides – that are rapidly transforming the Ukraine war into a fully fledged, open-ended international conflict. That in turn raises an alarming question: is all this fighting talk, all these threats and brinkmanship leading ineluctably towards nuclear confrontation? Sergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, purposefully conjured that terrifying prospect when he claimed Nato’s “proxy war” in Ukraine could trigger a third world war. Like a street corner spiv practising crude blackmail, Lavrov claimed there was a “considerable risk” such a war might go nuclear. Presumably he knows this because Putin is actually considering it. Liz Truss, Lavrov’s British counterpart, dodged the nuclear question in her Mansion House speech – but went for the jugular. Her bold declaration that total victory, plus the liberation of all occupied Ukrainian territory including Crimea, was a “strategic imperative” for the west may have surprised less gung-ho Nato allies who foolishly didn’t realise she speaks for them. If Putin won, “we would never feel safe again,” Truss warned. By her reasoning, Putin has to go – preferably before the next Tory leadership contest. America’s tone has hardened significantly, too. US president Joe Biden says he stands by his vow in March that Putin “cannot remain in power”. Lloyd Austin, his defence secretary, now says the US wants Russia permanently “weakened”. It should never again have the capability to threaten its neighbours, he said. Does Austin actually expect Putin to disarm? Despite denials, such loose statements sound like a push for regime change, even as Biden seeks a whopping $33bn in extra funding. Putin has also recklessly raised the stakes, threatening “retaliatory strikes as quick as lightning” against anyone meddling in Ukraine. To make his contemptuous point, he bombed António Guterres, the UN chief, who was visiting Kyiv. Russia says it may target Nato arms supply convoys. Explosions last week in a disputed region of Moldova are believed to be Russian false flag operations. This shows how easily the war could spread. In many ways, it already has. Oil depots are ablaze in southern Russia. Poland protested it was under “direct attack” after Moscow blocked gas supplies. The cut-off was denounced as a hostile act against Nato and the EU. Germany fears it may be next. But Berlin has nevertheless bowed to peer pressure to supply heavy weapons to Kyiv. Additional EU sanctions, including on oil, are imminent. All of this fuels an expanding fire. Biden has repeatedly insisted the conflict will be contained. “Direct confrontation between Nato and Russia is world war three, something we must strive to prevent,” he said after the invasion began. But war has its own deathly momentum. Daily acts of escalation point in one direction. Nato is like a patient in denial. The reality, by many measures, is that it’s already at war with Russia. Perhaps future historians of the Ukraine conflict will map the path to wider conflagration in the same way academic predecessors traced the origins of the first world war. It’s not hard to discern the developing pattern right now. Grievance, provocation, reaction, escalation, explosion. It’s unravelling in plain sight. Yet unlike in 1914, or during the first cold war, there are no agreed limits or rules in this fight. Worldwide, from Iran to North Korea, counter-proliferation efforts fail. Nuclear arms control treaties lapse. A revived global nuclear arms race accelerates. Military planners have normalised the use of low-yield tactical (battlefield) nukes. Russian doctrine reserves the right to go nuclear in response to conventional threats, if the state (or leadership) is at risk. Russia’s test last month of the nuclear-capable “Satan II” long-range missile carried a clear warning. “Given the setbacks they [Russia] have faced so far militarily, none of us can take lightly the threat posed by a potential resort to tactical nuclear weapons,” CIA director William Burns warned. It’s clear the west cannot abandon Ukraine simply out of fear over how far manic Putin might go. Such a collapse would wreck the global order, the UN, and Europe’s security. Yet the longer the war rages, the bigger the risk of a different kind of cataclysmic, world-changing event. So here’s the choice, as the northern English say: piss or get off the pot. Either the western allies act decisively, right now, to halt this war by demanding an immediate ceasefire and threatening and, if necessary, launching direct military intervention to secure it – as previously urged in this space. Or, alternatively, Truss, Austin and other hawks stop stoking the fire and setting unrealistic goals, and instead advise Kyiv to accept a negotiated settlement that, regrettably, will inevitably reward Putin’s aggression. Many find both choices disturbing. At present, forceful Nato intervention to “stop Mad Vlad” remains unlikely because Biden, principally, believes it’s too risky – even though he dearly wants shot of him. No one in Kyiv favours a “peace” deal at any price, as Guterres discovered. Nor will Putin give ground. On the contrary, he wants more. Thus, in all probability, this war will grind on, murderously, chaotically, ruinously, amid the ever-present risk that uncontrolled escalation may produce a nuclear catastrophe.

5/1/2022,"Living standards are set to fall at their fastest rate since records began in the mid-1950s. Last month, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that real household incomes will fall by 2.2% this year, as energy and food prices increase but wages fail to keep pace with rising bills. The impact will not be felt equally. For some, it will barely register. For other families, it will mean difficult decisions about what to cut back on. For others still, it will be profound, stretching precarious budgets in which there is already no give, forcing impossible choices between essentials such as putting food on the table and keeping the heating on, and sharpening the fear of the unexpected outlay that can trigger a debt spiral from which there is no escape. One estimate suggests lower-income households will face a drop in income of £1,300 this year. Last week, the latest thinking from ministers on how to address this crisis in living standards trickled into the headlines after a cabinet “brainstorming” meeting. Grant Shapps, the transport minister, proposed moving car MOTs from once a year to once every 24 months, saving a one-car household a paltry £23 a year, at the risk of jeopardising road safety. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, suggested increasing the maximum number of children an early-years worker can be responsible for in order to modestly reduce the cost of childcare. Others around the table reportedly suggested unilaterally scrapping tariffs on food imports, which would weaken Britain’s hand in trade negotiations, and scrapping government commitments to reduce carbon emissions, a move that would create significant long-term economic and environmental costs for the UK. The shallow suggestions reveal the government’s desperation to give voters the impression it is taking action to address these harsh economic circumstances, but without spending any money. They are not serious policies, but fodder for press releases before the local elections. Britain is experiencing a prolonged economic malaise. Wages have been mostly stagnant since the financial crisis, productivity has barely grown since then and sits 15% below the United States, Germany and France, and external shocks – the self-inflicted pain of leaving the EU’s single market and customs union, and the war in Ukraine – have sent prices rocketing. There are no shortcuts to increasing living standards. Any approach has to be three-pronged. First, economic policy needs to target rising productivity and to ensure the spoils are shared evenly with employees through increased wages, particularly for those in low-paid work. One of the reasons in-work poverty rates have risen is that there are too many jobs that simply do not pay enough to enable people, particularly those with children, to ensure a minimum standard of living. That can be achieved only by narrowing the growth gap between London and the south-east and the rest of the country. It would take, at the very minimum, a radical rebalancing of government investment in transport, infrastructure and skills away from the richest regions of the country, which already receive more investment per capita, towards the poorest. Brexit has only made this task harder; it is forecast to significantly reduce exports and to increase regional inequalities over the long term. Second, the real-terms cuts to benefits and tax credits of the past decade for low-income families with children must be reversed. In an economy with significant amounts of low-paid work, there will always be a need for government to redistribute income towards low-income parents. Yet successive Conservative chancellors have reduced the value of benefits and tax credits over time, with some families losing the equivalent of thousands of pounds a year from their household budgets, while delivering expensive income tax cuts that have disproportionately benefited more affluent households. This is another key reason why in-work poverty rates have increased and why, in a country as rich as ours, there are people, including those in work, relying on food banks to feed their children. The support that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has announced to help families with energy bills is too thinly spread, including across households for whom it is not critical, leaving the poorest families horribly exposed. Last, the government needs to implement structural reforms to tackle the high cost of living. The most important of these is housing, the costs of which erode too much of people’s pay cheques in one fell swoop. The UK has never built enough housing without significant public sector investment into social housing; yet social housebuilding levels have dropped dramatically since the 1980s, leaving the social housing stock to dwindle as a result of demolitions and the right to buy. This has pushed more and more people who have little hope of ever buying their own home into an overpriced private rented sector. Britain urgently needs a programme of public investment in housebuilding to create more affordable homes for rent. These are long-term economic reforms that require sustained investment. Even if put in place immediately, they will take time to fully deliver for the economy. Yet this is a government that swings from crisis to crisis, with little willing or capacity to plan for the next decade and a dearth of ideas to address Britain’s very real and structural economic problems. This lackadaisical approach will probably consign us to years more of sluggish growth that drives increasing numbers of families with children into poverty.",Opinion/Opinion,The Observer view on the cost of living crisis | Observer editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/01/observer-view-on-tory-response-to-cost-of-living-crisis
5/1/2022,"Labor has promised to reduce the cost of medicines on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme, roll out new charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and focus on improving pay equity for women if Anthony Albanese defeats Scott Morrison on 21 May. The Labor leader used the party’s official election campaign launch in Perth on Sunday to unveil a promise to reduce the cost of drugs on the PBS by $12.50. Albanese told the party faithful gathered at Optus Stadium that meant the maximum price for medicines for millions of Australians would be $30. In addition to a shared equity scheme to improve housing affordability for low and middle income earners that was flagged in the lead-up to Sunday’s launch, Albanese said Labor would accelerate the rollout of charging infrastructure for EVs and make gender equity an objective of the Fair Work Act. He said an Albanese government would use “all the tools in our power to close the gender pay gap”. Rebooting the Labor campaign after a week off the hustings recovering from coronavirus, Albanese declared Australians deserved a government that would shape the future. Watched on by the former Labor prime ministers Kevin Rudd and Paul Keating, as well as the Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, and the newly elected South Australian premier, Peter Malinauskas, the federal Labor leader said after the challenges of the past three years – floods, fires and the pandemic – Australians had “earned a better future”. Australians had “worked out” Scott Morrison, he said. “Australians understand we can’t bet our future on three more years of a prime minister who looks at every challenge facing our country and says that’s not my job,” the Labor leader said on Sunday. “For a decade now, the Liberals and Nationals have treated governing as an inconvenience and public money as a political slush fund.” Albanese said as prime minister he would not “run from responsibility” or treat every crisis as “a chance to blame someone else”. “I will show up, I will step up, I will bring people together. I will lead with integrity and treat you with respect.” He said if Australians wanted stronger universal healthcare, cheaper childcare, action on climate change, dignity and respect for older Australians – they needed to vote Labor. Albanese said Australians would have an opportunity on 21 May to end three terms of Coalition rule and “vote for hope and optimism over fear and division”. Introducing the Labor leader at Sunday’s event, the party’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, said Australians deserved a government as decent as its people. She said it was time to end “a decade of disappointment”. Polls suggest voters are yet to make up their minds about Albanese as the campaign enters its final weeks. Wong – one of Labor’s best-known figures – on Sunday characterised Albanese as “a man of courage and conviction, the most steadfast of friends, the toughest of fighters, and the kindest of hearts”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I know no one braver for his cause, no one more reliable when you need him. He will stand with you when it is easy and when it is hard.” Warming up for Albanese, McGowan quipped on Sunday: “Who would have thought that in a 12-month period, WA would play host to some of the biggest shows in Australia? The AFL grand final, the Brownlow, the rugby league State of Origin, the AFL Dreamtime game – and the Australian Labor party campaign launch.” The WA premier raised laughs by pointing out that he and Albanese were in sync. “We both caught Covid on the same day, we are both proud poodle owners – his is Toto, mine’s Georgie. “Both of us have been on a diet for some time, and lost a fair bit of weight – but, no matter how hard we work at it, neither of us look like Peter Malinaskus.” Labor held its official campaign in Perth for the first time since 1940 as part of an attempt to pick up three Liberal-held seats in the west – Swan (on a 3.2% margin), Pearce (5.2%) and Hasluck (5.9%). The party is also sandbagging the ultra-marginal seat of Cowan held by Anne Aly. Albanese hopes electoral gains in WA will form the bedrock of Labor’s pathway to victory. McGowan on Sunday reached back to Labor’s history in the state. He noted that WA had produced “two of our nation’s greatest citizens and prime ministers – John Curtin and Bob Hawke” – and noted that the Labor leader had always stood by the state “and supported us in the tough decisions we had to take” during the pandemic. Liberals fear a number of metropolitan seats could fall to the “teal” independents on 21 May but MPs believe support is holding up for the government in the regions and outer suburbs. Published opinion polls point to a Labor victory but there is still a chunk of voters who remain undecided as the campaign enters the final three weeks. The Guardian Essential poll points to a significant gender gap. Women are less inclined to approve of Morrison’s performance than Albanese’s. The centrepiece of Sunday’s Labor launch was a $329m housing affordability package for low and middle income earners, which would see the commonwealth take a stake in properties to help get renters into homeownership. After the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirmed last week that inflation was running at levels not seen for two decades, market analysts believe the Reserve Bank of Australia could raise the cash rate during the campaign for the first time since 2007. Albanese declared on Sunday that Australia could do better than “three more years of a government that’s brought us skyrocketing costs of living and falling real wages”.",News/Australia news,Anthony Albanese pledges to lower cost of PBS medicines and boost EVs at Labor campaign launch ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/01/anthony-albanese-pledges-to-lower-cost-of-pbs-medicines-and-boost-evs-at-labor-campaign-launch
5/1/2022,"Even through the haze of shimmering heat and thick Delhi dust, the mural is impossible to miss. Pinks, blues, greens and yellows pop off the wall, coming together to form a utopian scene of equality, and splashed across the middle is emblazoned a slogan designed to challenge India’s male-dominated society. “The future is femme,” it declares. The artwork stands at the entrance of this year’s India art fair, the country’s largest event showcasing Indian artists and galleries, which opens in Delhi this weekend after a two-year hiatus due to the pandemic. Its presence is significant. Aravani art collective, the artists behind the work, have never showcased in a major gallery, nor do they see themselves as a part of the money-driven art market, which exists mainly within the confines of white gallery walls. Aravani are India’s only trans art collective, encompassing about 40 trans people – mainly women but some men – from cities across the country, who paint murals and artworks across public spaces. Metro stations, schools, universities, flyovers and carparks have been transformed by their artworks depicting scenes of inclusion and gender fluidity. The murals have brought visibility and empowerment to the trans community, who are still largely shunned and stigmatised in India and often forced to live on the fringes of society. “In this mural we wanted to celebrate the intersectionality and inclusivity that has always existed within the trans community but is rarely visible in our society,” said Poornima Sukumar, who founded the collective in 2016. The decision to take part in the art fair was not an entirely comfortable one, said Sukumar, but one that she hoped would help shift perceptions and give them a platform to depict the multi-faceted nature of their collective and the trans community at large. “It’s important in our work to challenge that perception that everyone in the trans community is the same,” she said. “Yes many have run away from home because of the pressures and have ended up doing begging or sex work because that was the only viable source of money, but within those experiences there are so many individual journeys.” For Mayuri Pujari, who has been part of the collective since 2017, the impact of her involvement has been profound. “The visibility is empowering,” she said. “People see the trans community as professionals making art, not just begging on the roads.” Among the new generation of young artists being showcased at this year’s fair, which plays a pivotal role in India’s flourishing art market, many have used their works to push boundaries around sexuality, gender and queer stories. In a specially commissioned performance piece for example, Gurjeet Singh, a celebrated young Sikh artist from a small village on the border with Pakistan, delicately questions and inverts traditional gender roles in families and in the home. For Jaya Asokan, director of the fair, the “diversity and inclusion” widening India’s art landscape, as well as growing international interest in the Indian art market, meant the fair was taking place at “a turning point for Indian and south Asia art.” “A lot of our artists have had regional appeal for a while but the narrative is shifting and now they are in demand internationally,” said Asokan. Certainly from a commercial side, things have never looked so good for the Indian modern art market. The pandemic provided an unexpected boost to sales and over the past two years; there whave been at least three record-setting sales of modern Indian art, including Amrita Sher-Gil’s 1938 painting In the Ladies’ Enclosure for $5.14m, the second-highest amount ever paid for a modern Indian artwork. “I haven’t seen a market as strong as this one since 2006, which lasted for a few years before the financial crisis,” said Dinesh Vazirani, the chief executive of Indian art auction house Saffronart. He credited the boom to a multitude of factors, including lockdowns giving people a greater desire for beautiful objects in their homes and growing income among people in the world of Indian tech and pharmaceuticals, with newly minted businessmen and entrepreneurs wanting to invest in art as something “aspirational”. “We are seeing a whole new type of collector, young people in their 30s and 40s, entering the Indian market with a completely new mindset,” said Vazirani. “Art now has a societal standing and there’s almost a social pressure to buy art and buy the best. So people who were entering the market at $100,000 are now willing to go up to half a million. At every auction we have seen records broken, one after the other.” Yet the shifts within the market are not solely within the sphere of Indian modern and contemporary art. For the first time, this year’s art fair is showcasing rare items of Indian folk art, some dating back 100 years, illustrating changing perceptions towards older indigenous art within the Indian market, which has always been focused on the modern and contemporary. Among the works on show are a series of bronze mukhalingam sculptures, a representation of the Hindu god Shiva, which have never been seen in public before. “Our folk culture has been much more popular overseas in the last four decades than it has on the Indian domestic market,” said Amit Jain, who curated the folk art booths at this year’s fair. “I’m used to this art and these artists being seen as on the peripheries so it’s amazing to see India’s full history brought into this contemporary space. It’s high time that museums in India look at art laterally and not compartmentalised into modern and folk.” The fair will also address the darker side of the Indian art market, particularly when it comes to antiquities. Collectors and viewers have been invited to a tour of a Museum of Confiscated Antiquities in Purana Quila, an old fort in Delhi, where the objects on show will be those recently returned to India after being stolen and sold to wealthy collectors or displayed in the world’s famed galleries. The museum features items reclaimed from high-profile looters now in jail but also institutions such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. “India is one of the biggest victims of illicit trafficking of antiquities, it’s a black market that’s as big as drugs and ammunitions and we still have a lot of looting going on,” said Anica Mann, the curator of the young collectors programme at the fair who has curated and will lead the tour. “Antiquities are a very important cog in the entire roster of south Asian art so it’s about time we talked about ethical collecting.”",News/World news,‘A turning point’: Indian art fair challenges gender and sexual stereotypes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/01/a-turning-point-indian-art-fair-challenges-gender-and-sexual-stereotypes
