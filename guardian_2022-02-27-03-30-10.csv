2/27/2022,"Republican leaders are facing fresh demands to expel the Georgia congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, after she spoke at a conference of white nationalists and sympathisers with Vladimir Putin. The event in Orlando, Florida, on Friday night was organised by the far-right extremist Nick Fuentes, who told attendees: “Now they’re going on about Russia and Vladimir Putin is Hitler – they say that’s not a good thing.” He burst into laughter as he added: “I shouldn’t have said that!” Fuentes, recently subpoenaed for his involvement in the January 6 insurrection, proudly introduced Taylor Greene at the third annual America First Political Action Conference, or AFPAC. The Georgia congresswoman told the gathering they were “canceled Americans” who had a responsibility to “stop the Democrats who are the communist party of the United States of America”, HuffPost reported. Her patronage of AFPAC, where the Arizona congressman Paul Gosar also appeared via pre-recorded video, provoked sharp condemnation of party leaders for failing to discipline her. Liz Cheney, a member of the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot, tweeted: “As Rep[resentative] Marjorie Taylor Greene and Rep[resentative] Paul Gosar speak at this white supremacist, antisemitic, pro-Putin event, silence by Republican party leaders is deafening and enabling. “All Americans should renounce this garbage and reject the Putin wing of the GOP now.” The Democratic National Committee (DNC) pointed out that Kevin McCarthy, the Republican minority leader in the House, has consistently failed to take action against Greene. Ammar Moussa, a spokesperson for the DNC, said: “In any other world, Greene speaking at a white supremacist conference where attendees have defended Vladimir Putin and praised Adolf Hitler would warrant expulsion from the caucus, to say nothing of her advocacy for violence and consistent antisemitism is disgusting. “Quite simply, the longer Kevin McCarthy gives Marjorie Taylor Greene an unfettered platform and promises to elevate her, the more complicit he is.” On Saturday, Greene sought to defend her appearance at AFPAC. She told CBS News: “I went to talk to them about America First policies and I talked to them about what’s important for our country going forward. “Now, in regards to Russia, Putin is a murderer and he should never have invaded Ukraine. What he is doing is completely wrong. I stand with our Nato member allies and I’m completely against this war. Everything that he’s doing is wrong. He’s killing people over and over so I’m staunchly against it and I’m staunchly against Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.” Asked if she endorses Fuentes’s views, Taylor Greene claimed: “I don’t know what his views are.” Told that he is a white nationalist, she said: “I do not endorse those views.” Greene gave the interview on the sidelines of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), a separate event in Orlando. She appeared on a panel hours before former president Donald Trump was due to speak. The congresswoman attacked Twitter for banning her and promoted Trump’s new social media site, Truth Social. She taunted Hillary Clinton, the former Democratic presidential nominee, and Anthony Fauci, infectious diseases expert and chief medical adviser to Joe Biden. “We have to hold Democrats accountable, everybody. Right? Fire Fauci! We’ve got to investigate Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Lock her up! Lock them all up!” With that she laughed, as the audience burst into applause. Greene has a history of antisemitic and incendiary comments that include blaming California wildfires on “Jewish space lasers”, suggesting Muslims do not belong in government and warning that “gazpacho police” – presumably she meant Gestapo – patrol the US Capitol. But the timing of her AFPAC speech could hardly have been more provocative. Fred Wellman, a political consultant and Iraq war veteran, commented on Twitter: “This is where Marjorie Taylor Greene spent her evening. Laughing about comparisons to Hitler being bad. This is who she is. You know they burned crosses in Martin Luther King’s yard just 62 years ago. It’s time for Georgia to put this trash out forever.”",News/US news,Calls to expel Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene after speech at white nationalist event ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/26/republican-congresswoman-marjorie-taylor-greene-cpac
2/27/2022,"Welcome to the reboot. The costumes are the same and you’ll recognise some of the main characters, but there’s no doubt that the West Indies tour that begins this coming week is meant to kick off a new narrative arc for the failing franchise that is the England men’s team. Clearly, Andrew Strauss was impressed by what Tom Holland did for Spider-Man: England have landed in Antigua with a young cast bursting with peppy enthusiasm. They have also dropped their two legacy stars; for those of us still contemplating the pointlessness of a Sex and the City sequel without Samantha, the omission of Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad has come at a particularly raw moment. There’s better news, however, for all the glovework geeks and stumping superfans out there: Ben Foakes, the Best Wicketkeeper in the World (source: Alec Stewart), will be back in the team, a year after he played his last Test match. And it’s not a little poignant his return to the side comes in Antigua, given this was the island where he lost his spot as England’s first-choice keeper three years ago. For those who struggle to remember those pre-Covid years, Foakes arrived for England’s last West Indies tour “on cloud nine”, in his words, after a sensational start to his Test career in Sri Lanka where he scored a century on debut. He had a bad game in Barbados, scoring two and five as England collapsed to 77 in their first innings and lost by 381 runs; when they were trounced again in Antigua, Foakes was the first to pay the price. “It’s fair to say at the time I thought I might get a slightly longer run,” he says. “But when you’re new into a team and you are losing then I guess you are vulnerable.” Confused and disappointed, he stumbled through the following season for Surrey averaging 26.13 and losing all pleasure in the game. Foakes says he has since realised it was simply a case of burnout. Playing in every format for his county and touring with England and the Lions each winter, without the built-in breaks afforded by a central contract, had taken its toll. “When you’re on the fringes for that number of years it can wear you down mentally,” he says. “It’s definitely something that all players on the fringes have found difficult in the last few years.” It is sobering to reflect that Foakes’s aggregate of 48 runs in the Antigua Test three years ago was England’s third-highest for the match. Jonny Bairstow, handed the gloves mid-series, managed 16 runs in his next five Test innings and it’s fair to say that Foakes was not afforded the “best opportunity to succeed” Chris Silverwood insisted on when Jos Buttler was struggling to score. On the 2020-21 India tour, when Foakes next got to the crease, as a temporary stand-in for Buttler, he top-scored with 42 not out as his team collapsed to 134 all out in the first innings in Chennai. His England shirt would have got more wear last summer, too, if it had not been for a horribly unlucky dressing-room injury sustained at the end of a game when he slipped on the floor in socked feet and ended up in involuntary splits. A torn hamstring kept him off the field for three months: another blow to the hopes of a 29-year-old who had devoted “100%” of his career towards the goal of playing Test cricket. “Everything hit at once,” he says: disappointment and frustration, fear for his future, even guilt for letting teammates down. But the support of Surrey’s psychologist and Stewart proved invaluable. In some ways, the injury break – on top of Covid’s tour-cancelling habits – has helped him regroup. “I’ve not played anywhere near as much cricket, so that energy and drive has come back.” If there’s a calm maturity to the Foakes who is back in Antigua after three years on the sidelines, it mirrors his onfield approach. Those hypnotic keeping skills rarely deliver the eye-catching leaps and dramatic flourishes that usually get crowds gasping because he’s always in the right place to gather the ball without fuss. The kind of Foakes move that leaves you murmuring in wonder is the one that anticipates the ball to a place no other keeper would reach, like a leg slip position as the batter sweeps the ball off the face of the bat. His batting can be similarly undramatic, a contrast with the big-hitting, fast-scoring promise of his rivals. Is he frustrated that his consistency has not been better appreciated? “I don’t know if frustration’s the right word, but I don’t just see myself as a keeper. I’ve got a pretty decent record.” Fragile England may well appreciate a touch more stolidity from their new No 7. “The best thing for me is to go out and play my natural game,” he says. “I’m not trying to be someone that I’m not.” He hopes that playing alongside Kemar Roach at Surrey will help him counter the Barbadian’s challenging pace. England are unsure what to expect from the islands’ various pitches, but “they use a Dukes ball and it looks like a bit more seam- than spin-friendly recently”. As for the mood in the camp, it is, Foakes says, “pretty high” right now. “I wasn’t around for too long in Australia but it looked like a tough tour. Out here there’s a bit more flexibility in terms of being able to get out of your rooms and I think people are enjoying that.” More than anything, though, he senses the excitement of young players “champing at the bit to get going”. That’s how reboots always start: new cast, new energy. What they need more than anything, now, is a new script.",Sport/Sport,Ben Foakes intent on grabbing Test chance as part of England’s reboot,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/26/ben-foakes-test-chance-england-reboot-west-indies
2/27/2022,"Three days after the invasion there are signs that Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine is not quite going to plan. In the Sumy region, close to the border with Russia, a local resident came across an extraordinary sight. On a country road lined with birch trees, a Russian armoured vehicle had broken down. He pulled up in his car and stopped. There was then a surreal conversation. “Looks like you guys broke down,” he said to three Russian soldiers, standing by the road. “We ran out of fuel,” one replied. “Can I tow you back to Russia,” he joked. They laughed and asked him for news. “Do you know where you are going?” he inquired. “No,” they answered. Further along the road other Russian vehicles had conked out. The driver told the hapless soldiers that “everything is on our side” and that Russians were busy surrendering. No one from Putin’s invading army seemed to know where they were going, or why they were even in Ukraine, he concluded. It is too early to describe the Kremlin’s operation to seize and subjugate Ukraine as a failure. The war has only just started. Putin may yet prevail. The Russian military enjoys overwhelming superiority over Ukraine’s armed forces. It has numerous combat aircraft, a vast navy and 150,000 deployed troops. And yet by Saturday, it was clear Putin’s blitzkrieg operation to remove Ukraine’s pro-western government had run into unexpected difficulties. Evidently, there were logistical issues. Re-supplying troops in a vast enemy country was proving a challenge. So was seizing Kyiv, Ukraine’s defiant capital, home in normal times to three million people. The Kremlin’s original plan, according to Ukrainian intelligence, was to encircle the city with land forces and, during a night operation, to fly in 5,000 elite paratroopers. They would storm the Mariinsky presidential palace, detain or kill Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and take control over key government buildings, including the foreign and defence ministries. Having mopped up resistance, and arrested key figures, Moscow would install a pro-Russian puppet administration. This has not happened. Instead, Kyiv remained under government control this weekend after Ukrainian forces repulsed a series of attacks. Zelenskiy has encouraged his citizens with homemade videos. Meanwhile, Russian parachutists who tried to seize an airfield in the city of Vasylkiv, as a bridgehead to grab Kyiv, were beaten back. “Our 40th Brigade was powerful. It repulsed the attack,” Nataliia Balasynovych, Vasylkiv’s mayor, told the Kyiv Independent newspaper. “They [Russian troops] landed with parachutes in the fields, forests and villages.” She added: “The worst fighting was on Decembrists’ street. The whole street was on fire.” Air defence units said they had shot down an Ilyushin-76 transport plane near Bila Tserkva, 80km south of Kyiv – one of several downed enemy aircraft. Ukraine’s military command said it had wiped out an entire enemy column around the city of Kharkiv, something video appeared to confirm. Since the invasion began on Thursday, Russia has lost 14 aircraft, eight helicopters, 102 tanks, 15 heavy machine guns and one BUK missile, the Ukrainian military said. It had also lost 3,500 soldiers, with 200 taken hostage, it added. These figures are hard to verify. But they illustrate the almost universal hostility which has greeted invading Russian forces. The Kremlin has had most success in the south of the country, where it has captured large swathes of territory, including much of Kherson province and the city of Melitopol. Videos have shown some extraordinary acts of civic resistance. In Bakhmach, in the Chernihiv region, a resident tried to stop a tank with his bare hands. He knelt in front of it before his friends dragged him away. In another viral clip, shared by Ukrainian media outlets, a man jumped in front of a military convoy, with vehicles forced to swerve. There are also numerous interviews with Russian soldiers who have surrendered. On Thursday, Kremlin forces captured Sumy, 60km from the Russian border. By Saturday, however, locals appeared to have taken some of the city back, and to have captured a young Russian conscript, who appeared dazed and confused. The invasion has caused a vast human exodus, with tens of thousands seeking refuge in the west of the country and beyond. It has also prompted a wave of patriotic feeling. From Lviv to Dnipro in the centre and Kharkiv in the east, volunteers have been picking up weapons, making molotov cocktails or removing road signs to confuse the invaders. “I’ve had calls from 10 people asking how to help,” Lviv resident Olga Bileychuk said. “Some of the girls wanted to make molotovs but were told only boys could do it. It’s quite sexist.” Others were joining defensive units, she said. One friend gave his Land Cruiser to a Ukrainian soldier seeking to rejoin his brigade in distant Mariupol, which has been holding out against Russian attack. The creative classes have also been doing their bit. Many have taken up arms, having originally fought in 2014 when Moscow annexed Crimea and kickstarted an armed uprising in the Donbas region. Two standup comedians were busy preparing food in a closed restaurant in Kyiv on Saturday, as a curfew was introduced. Others shared anti-Putin memes. So how did we get here? One explanation is the increasingly erratic behaviour of Putin himself. Speaking before the invasion, a senior Ukrainian intelligence official said Russia’s president lived in a strange parallel reality. He had succumbed – like dictators before him – to believing his own version of the world. “Putin thinks that Ukraine’s government is corrupt, western and irredeemably Russophobic,” the official said. “He understood the Ukrainian people, by contrast, would welcome Russia and intervention. He considers us to be rural Russians.” Putin’s spy agencies had told him what he wanted to hear, he added. The official continued: “We have always understood Russians better than they understand us.” Other commentators noted that Putin, an amateur historian, had forgotten one of the great lessons of the second world war – that the best Soviet soldiers were Ukrainian. It is impossible to know if there is growing unhappiness within Putin’s national security council over the decision to go to war. On the eve of the invasion last week all of its members signed off on Putin’s plan to recognise the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics as independent, an act that pushed the button on military action. Western defence attaches have claimed that Valery Gerasimov, Putin’s most senior commander and the chief of the general staff of Russia’s armed forces, had warned the president that invading Ukraine might not be straightforward. And so it has proved. For now, though, Russia’s military and political leadership are firmly behind the operation. As losses mount, difficult questions pile up for the Kremlin. In the face of Ukrainian intransigence and resistance, how does it intend to govern the country? Any Donetsk-style puppet government would lack legitimacy. Even if Moscow succeeds in seizing Kyiv, months and years of problems lie ahead. Nobody expects Ukrainians to capitulate. More likely is partisan war. The driver who came across the broken-down military carrier best summarised Putin’s predicament. “I asked the whole column,” he said of the Russian soldiers. “No one knows where they are and where they are going.”",News/World news,How Ukrainian defiance has derailed Putin’s plans,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/how-ukrainian-defiance-has-derailed-putins-plans
2/27/2022,"Mourners from across the political spectrum gathered in Belfast on Saturday for the funeral service of DUP MLA Christopher Stalford. The DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, alongside party MPs and MLAs (Members of the Legislative Assembly), were among the congregation at Ravenhill Presbyterian Church in south Belfast. Stalford, 39, who was a father of four, died suddenly last weekend. He was the principal deputy speaker at the Northern Ireland assembly and held a seat in South Belfast. The Ulster Unionist party leader Doug Beattie and Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister attended the funeral service. Representatives from Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Alliance party and the Green party were also in attendance and a crowd had gathered outside the church to pay their respects. The Rev Marty Gray told mourners: “Today we grieve for the years ahead he will not see, and for the ambitions, he will not get to fulfil.” The service heard of Stalford’s love for his family and his south Belfast community. Gray recalled how the politician was “proud of his working-class upbringing”. “When he went canvassing for the south Belfast seat he made sure everyone knew where he went to school so they could be sure he was a south Belfast boy through and through,” he said. Mourners also heard of Stalford’s devotion to his wife, Laura, and his family. “Christopher and Laura had known each other since they were young children,” Gray told the congregation. “From the age of 16, Laura and Christopher were inseparable. He was her best friend and she was his and they have been that way ever since.” The couple, he added, were married by former DUP leader Ian Paisley, who had left a meeting with Tony Blair early to conduct the service for the “special couple”. North Belfast DUP assembly member (MLA) William Humphrey, who also spoke at the funeral, said Stalford’s “outstanding young life has been taken far too soon”. He paid tribute to the “strong, articulate” politician, who was “unique” and “a true character with a huge intellect, an acerbic wit with an infectious laugh”. In a statement released before the funeral, Laura Stalford said her children will remember their father as the “best dad in the world”. The death of Stalford caused shock waves across politics, with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, among those who paid tribute. Donaldson said earlier that his party was devastated by the loss of “our dear friend and much-loved colleague”. Stalford was elected to Stormont in 2016 having previously served on Belfast city council, where he was deputy mayor and high sheriff of the city.",News/UK news,Funeral of DUP’s Christopher Stalford attended by all main parties,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/26/funeral-of-dups-christopher-stalford-attended-by-all-main-parties
2/27/2022,"In the bunkers and underground tunnels of Kyiv, life continues underground, even as explosions sound overhead. Teens sit glued to iPhones, parents tuck quilts around their children to sleep. Some hold pets, while others sit in darkened, unmoving subway cars. And babies arrive. In one shelter in Kyiv, a woman gave birth to a girl, Mia. Sharing an image of the newborn child wrapped in blankets while others in the shelter are visible in the background, Hanna Hopko, a former Ukrainian MP and chair of Democracy in Action Conference, said Mia was born in the shelter in a “stressful environment”. But she said that despite the challenging experience, Mia’s mother was happy, adding: “We defend lives and humanity!” 🇺🇦 Mia was born in shelter this night in stressful environment- bombing of Kyiv.

In Luhansk, hospital staff rushed to make an underground makeshift ward in the basement of Starobilsk Multidisciplinary hospital while Russian forces fired outside after a woman went into labour and later gave birth to a boy. The hospital wrote on Facebook: “Three danger warnings a day. In the morning, shelling of a residential area next to the hospital. Now, somewhere very close to the heavy fire … in the waiting room – the wounded … “Meanwhile, in the basement of the maternity hospital, in conditions far from those that a new life deserves – a loud cry of a newborn … Boy!” Ukrainian MP, Anastasia Radina, compared the scene to London during the blitz. “Ukrainian mothers are now giving birth in shelters and metro stations during air raids,” she wrote on Twitter. “The blitz of London 1940 is being repeated by Russia in Ukraine in 2022. Nato must make UA no-fly zone.” Other footage showed newborn babies moved to a makeshift bomb shelter from a neonatal intensive care unit at a children’s hospital in Dnipro, eastern Ukraine. Dr Denis Surkov, chief of the neonatal unit at Dnipropetrovsk Oblast children’s clinic hospital, said in a statement: “This is our reality”. As bombs and artillery rained down on the capital on Friday night, thousands huddled in the subterranean subway stations, basements and bomb shelters, many accompanied by children, bearing sleeping bags, belongings and stuffed toy animals. “The kids were scared, they cry and ask ‘Mom, will we all die?’,” Alla, a woman in her 40s told Reuters’ reporters at a basement shelter in Kyiv. The basement where she took cover was packed with hundreds of people with no place to sleep, only chairs and some water. Even finding a place to sit was difficult. “We don’t know how long we have to stay here. Good we have chairs at least,” a 35-year-old woman who gave her name as Viktoria said, while her children, five and seven, slept, still wearing their winter coats. “Right now, all we can hear is the sound of shells,” Lakshmi Devi, 21, a third year student at the Kharkiv National medical university, told Reuters. “We can’t even count how many.” Devi is one of thousands of international students stranded in Kyiv. He and others sheltered in their apartment’s basement as the explosions sounded around the city. As dawn broke on Saturday, Kyiv officials warned residents that street fighting was under way against Russian forces, and urged people to seek shelter. The warning advised residents to remain in shelters, avoid going near windows or on balconies, and take precautions against being hit by debris or bullets.",News/World news,"Fear, darkness and newborn babies: inside Ukraine’s underground shelters",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/fear-darkness-and-newborn-babies-inside-ukraine-underground-shelters
2/27/2022,"You know the world is changing when there is no leopard print in a Dolce & Gabbana show. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana are the first to admit that they are unlikely champions for the metaverse. “Because of our age, we are outsiders,” said Domenico, 63, before the brand’s Milan fashion week show. Gabbana, who is 59, added that “the metaverse is for a different generation, but we are curious about it. You have to try and understand what is new.” At their show, a virtual catwalk was stitched together with a real one. On a giant screen, avatars wearing the new collection took a pixellated 3D strut toward the audience. A physical catwalk was projected from the screen into the venue, and when the virtual models reached the catwalk, they disappeared and were replaced by flesh and blood ones, who walked the runway. The look took its cue not, this season, from the designers’ native Sicily but from the metaverse, with plenty of rain-slicked black and exaggerated silhouettes. A red latex heart-shaped dress looked like a walking, human-sized emoji. But then, transporting women into a fantasy world is what the designers have been doing for 38 years. The metaverse avatar is to the 21st century what the silver screen bombshell was to the 20th century. The traditional skills of tailoring in shaping the body, as Gabbana pointed out before this show, “can make the impossible possible”. By translating the Sicilian tailoring in which the brand is rooted into digital form, he said, “we can show tailoring to a new generation”. “Molto sexy” remains in place as the unofficial house motto. The invitation was a glossy red box, containing a tissue-wrapped black lace suspender belt and sheer stockings. “It’s a tease!” said Gabbana before the show, rolling his eyes. “Look, we are Italian, we like sexy. Don’t take it too seriously, OK?” Avatars and models alike wore sheer bras and corset-laced miniskirts. Dolce & Gabbana stopped using fur last year, and atelier workers who had previously worked with fur have been retrained with new skills. This season, fake fur was sewn on to sheer tulle dresses. “Once we would have said – fur on tulle, that’s impossible,” said the designers. “Now we say, let’s try and see what happens.” Reports of Dolce & Gabbana’s cancellation have turned out to be greatly exaggerated. In 2018, images of a Chinese model eating Italian food with chopsticks, which appeared on the brand’s social media channels to publicise a Shanghai catwalk show, were widely deemed offensive, and led to the label being pulled from major retailers in China, the world’s largest luxury goods market. However, working with two international crisis management companies, the brand has made a commercial recovery. Sales of Dolce & Gabbana in China in 2021 were up 20% on 2020. Globally, the predicted shunning of the brand did not hold. Within the past year, high-profile endorsements have come from Megan Thee Stallion, who wore four outfits by the label to the Grammys, from Cardi B in a bespoke crystal-embroidered maternity catsuit at the BET awards, and from Angela Bassett in a feather gown at last year’s Golden Globes.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Dolce & Gabbana embrace the metaverse at Milan fashion week,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/26/dolce-gabbana-embrace-the-metaverse-at-milan-fashion-week
2/27/2022,"A clear majority of Americans think Vladimir Putin would not have ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine had Donald Trump still been in the White House, according to a new poll. The poll, by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies (Caps)-Harris, found that 62% of those surveyed believed Putin would not have sent troops into Ukraine with Trump in the White House. In partisan terms, the survey found that 85% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats held the view. The poll, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday this week among 2,026 registered voters, found that 59% said Putin only ordered the invasion because he saw weakness in Joe Biden. Forty-one percent said the US president was not a factor in Putin’s decision. Republicans in Congress have attacked Biden for perceived weakness in the face of autocratic leaders abroad. Party figures have been less keen to discuss Trump’s expressions of admiration for Putin during the Ukraine crisis. The Harvard study’s findings broadly buttressed a Fox News poll, carried out before Russia invaded, that found more Republicans had a negative view of Biden than of Putin and more Democrats had a negative view of Trump than of the Russian leader. That study said 92% of Republicans had a negative view of Biden while 81% had a negative view of Putin. Among Democrats, 87% had a negative view of Trump and 85% a negative view of Putin. A third poll, released by NPR/PBS/Marist College, will add concern for a Biden administration battling low approval ratings generated by public dissatisfaction on fronts including handling of the pandemic, the Afghanistan withdrawal, a stalled legislative agenda and inflation. The NPR-Marist poll found that 56% of Americans said Biden’s first year in office was a “failure”. Just 39% called it a success. Two-thirds of independents said Biden’s first year was a failure, while 91% of Republicans said so.
