3/25/2022,"Health authorities have given the green light for a “winter jab” to become available for millions of high risk Australians and pre-flight testing for arrivals will be scrapped under significant changes to living with the virus. Health minister Greg Hunt announced international arrivals will no longer need to be tested for Covid-19 prior to travel after 17 April when the government’s biosecurity emergency determination lapses. Hunt said international arrivals would still need to be fully vaccinated to enter Australia and wear masks on flights. Hunt also announced that on Friday that the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) had officially recommended a second booster shot to adults 65 years and over, Indigenous Australians 50 years and over, aged care and disability residents. The booster jab will become available from 4 April for the eligible groups at pharmacies, general practices, state, commonwealth and Indigenous medical clinics in anticipation of covid surge. On the same day, the commonwealth will begin rolling out its winter flu program to a similar cohort as well as children under five, pregnant women and Indigenous Australians of all age demographics. “I’ve now received advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation - and they’ve worked very closely with Professor Kelly - and they have recommended that there should be a winter dose, or second booster - or, in some cases, that will be known as a fourth dose - for particular groups of people,” Hunt said. “We gave complete freedom to Atagi, and Paul and his team have worked very closely with the medical experts, and I thank them for their work. “They’ve probably considered this more closely than almost any other decision, in reaching those outcomes.” A fourth vaccine was previously restricted to severely immunocompromised people 16 years and over, between four and six months after receiving a first booster shot. The new dose can be provided at the same time as an annual flu vaccine, with at-risk Australians encouraged to receive both vaccinations before winter hits. It comes just days after the NHS in England recommended a fourth vaccination for a similar cohort, as Covid cases continued to spike amongst the elderly population. South Korea and Israel are also recommending a fourth dose for elderly people and vulnerable cohorts, while Pfizer and BioNTech have emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration for a fourth dose among the over 65s. NSW recorded 23,702 new Covid cases on Friday and seven further deaths. There were 1,182 people being treated in hospital with the virus, including 43 people requiring intensive care. Victoria recorded 9,244 new Covid cases and nine deaths on Friday. There were 253 people hospitalised with the virus and 19 in intensive care. On 10 March, NSW health minister Brad Hazzard warned Covid cases were expected to double in the state within six weeks as the Omicron subvariant BA.2 spreads. Since then, Covid cases have jumped by some 7,000 in NSW while hospitalisations have stayed relatively stable, as have the numbers of patients in intensive care beds. “We are down to 24 people on ventilation for Covid in Australia, that’s down from 206 who were on ventilation in October,” Hunt said on Friday. “And cases will rise and they will fall and at times we will see an increase in the number of people who are either in ICU … and our ventilation is key indicator. “The system is strong, the system is robust, every state, every state and territory is prepared.” It comes as the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) urges the commonwealth to launch a media campaign encouraging the general population to take up the booster shot. While some 95% of eligible Australians have received their second vaccine, booster rates continue to lag. As of 13 March, only 65.6% of eligible people had received a third vaccine dose, while in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, just 49.4% had the jab.

3/25/2022,"A shipment of replica firearms by China to Solomon Islands police has caused concern as the Pacific nation grapples with security concerns sparked by its increasingly close relationship with Beijing. The police force had been criticised over the secrecy surrounding delivery of what a local media report called a “large shipment of arms” that arrived in the country on a logging vessel earlier this month from an unknown source. On Tuesday the police said the firearms – 95 rifles and 92 pistols – were replicas donated by China for police training and denied accusations the force had anything “to conceal or hide”. It also published pictures of police training with the replicas. Solomon Islands banned firearms and replica weapons in 2000 during a bloody ethnic conflict in which police armouries were raided by militia groups. However, police were allowed to carry weapons again in 2017. “These things do not in any way threaten the security of this country so far, except they are as good as helping RSIPF [Royal Solomon Islands Police Force] in building its tactical knowledge and capabilities,” police commissioner Mostyn Mangau said in a statement. “RSIPF is the main security agency of this country and so some of the methodology we use or apply does not need the public to be aware of this as a matter of national security,” he added. It comes amid wider security concerns that Beijing could base navy warships in the area, according to a leaked draft security agreement that emerged on Thursday. Those arrangements are also likely to worry the United States, which said in February it would open an embassy in Solomon Islands after senior US administration officials expressed concern China wanted to create military relationships in the Pacific islands. It comes just months after rioting in Solomon Islands, sparked in part by the country’s 2019 switch of diplomatic relations to Beijing from Taiwan. The Solomon Islands’ political opposition remains sceptical about the replica firearms consignment and has demanded access to the replicas in order to verify they are not real weapons. “Questions that raise a lot of suspicion are why are replica guns offloaded at a log pond somewhere in Guadalcanal on a logging barge? Why are they not shipped commercially and offloaded at our internationally recognised port?” deputy opposition leader Peter Kenilorea Jr said. The government has dissociated itself from the saga and said it would be up to the police to decide whether they would allow media to view the replica guns in order to ease public concerns. In November last year, up to 60 buildings in the capital, Honiara, were destroyed in riots that caused more than $300m of damage. Buildings in Chinatown were targeted during the outbreak of arson and looting. The unrest came after the decision by the prime minister, Manasseh Sogavare, to launch relations with China fuelled a dispute between the national government and the most populous province, Malaita, although other domestic issues also stirred discontent. Troops and police from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Papua New Guinea were deployed to the country to assist local police in the immediate aftermath. China has also since sent a team of police officers to help with training.",News/World news,Secret shipment of replica guns to Solomon Islands police by China triggers concern,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/secret-shipment-of-replica-guns-to-solomon-islands-police-by-china-triggers-concern
3/25/2022,"“Football is the most important of the least important things in life.” The great Italian football coach Arrigo Sacchi was talking about a different sport, but the sentiment also rings true for rugby for Pacific peoples in New Zealand, Australia and the islands they still call home. The southern hemisphere’s premier professional rugby union club competition, renamed Super Rugby Pacific for 2022, has featured teams from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Argentina and Japan since its inception in 1996. Countless Pasifika people have played for these clubs or franchises, but the islands have their own teams in Super Rugby this season – the Fijian Drua, who are run by the Fiji Rugby Union and have played all their matches in Australia so far due to Covid-19, and Moana Pasifika, who are partnered with the Samoan and Tongan Rugby Unions and based at Mt Smart Stadium in Auckland. The Drua (pronounced n’drua) bounced back from two tough opening losses last month to claim their first win against the Melbourne Rebels. Since then, they have only been denied further wins by last minute scores from the Queensland Reds and Western Force over the last fortnight. Moana Pasifika have only played twice so far with Omicron outbreaks in the New Zealand-based team camps forcing game postponements. After spending over a month bubbled in Queenstown with the other Kiwi sides, Moana had their first game at Mt Smart last Saturday behind closed doors. Finally, on Friday night they will play in front of fans for the first time when the Hurricanes visit. Hooker Ray Niuia, who was born and raised in Auckland and has deep roots in the Samoan villages of Saipipi and Saanapu, will make his debut for the club on Friday and says it will be “unreal” to take the field in front of family and supporters. “It’ll hopefully give us a bit of edge to play with,” Niuia said. The 13-cap Manu Samoa veteran was one of a handful able to watch last week’s defeat to the Chiefs in person, but he and the other non-playing reserves created the atmosphere themselves all game long with songs and chants. They even brought out a portable sound system from the changing room at half-time. “To just be able to create something out of nowhere, that’s just us I guess,” Niuia said. “That’s our culture, we’re not afraid to show it. Even if it’s just banging on the chairs with sticks and making chants, that’s just us.” Tongan flanker Solomone Funaki is expecting more of the same on Friday night from the team’s burgeoning fanbase. “We all know our Pacific people, they’re really supportive and loud,” the 27 year-old said. “It’s really motivational looking out at the fans, knowing your family will be out there in the stands somewhere.” Funaki, who is from the villages of Fanga ‘o Pilolevu and Pangai, knows his parents will be watching him play on TV back home in Tonga. He grew up watching Super Rugby there, becoming a fan of Otago’s Highlanders team because of a fellow Tongan - the All Black centre Malakai Fekitoa – and modelled his game after another Tongan in their former captain Nasi Manu. Now that Moana Pasifika has become a reality, the next generation of players in the islands can dream of playing for a team that was created just for them. Vice-chairperson of the Moana Pasifika board, Debbie Sorenson, can see it – an open fale, a big screen TV and everyone gathered around to see their team play every week. The New Zealand-born Tongan said the challenges of Covid for communities both in the islands and abroad are having a huge impact, particularly on youth mental health. “Being able to provide a story of hope, which is the story of Moana Pasifika, is really important,” Sorenson said. “It’s more than just a game; we’re creating futures for young men and eventually young women.” She said not everyone understands the connection between sport and the good it can do. “People often think it’s just a game of rugby, but there are longer and deeper benefits I think around inspiration and uplifting people’s spirits.”",News/World news,‘More than just a game’: Moana Pasifika rugby provides story of hope for the islands | Thomas Airey,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/25/more-than-just-a-game-moana-pasifika-rugby-provides-story-of-hope-for-the-islands
3/25/2022,"I’m a mentally and physically fit widow in my late 70s. I have been unhappy about my relationship of over 55 years with a “friend” who was once my sister-in-law. Why do I still put up with a person who throws a sarcastic remark at moments when you need a friendly hug? Who never fails, given the opportunity, to rub salt into a wound? I have two children and four grandchildren who live nearby and we are all very close. It seems unkind to drop her now as she was not so similarly blessed. We all have burdens to carry throughout our lives, I know. But her negative, unfeeling attitudes never fail to irritate or bring me down. Eleanor says: One of the defining features of a friendship is that we don’t keep a rolling moral score of each other. Love is patient, love is kind, “it keeps no record of wrongs”. This is a very nice thing, usually – it means we can reveal our unpolished selves. We can be frank and loved and forgiven and idiosyncratic all at the same time. But sometimes it means that, after years of friendship, we look up at the person we call a friend and realise that in the time we weren’t keeping inventory of the ethical infractions, they were still busy racking them up. It’s a very peculiar feeling to see someone with those newly evaluative eyes. We might have always known they had the traits that now seem so vividly irritating – that they were prone to sarcasm, in your friend’s case, or that they weren’t especially comforting – but we hadn’t got all the way to the question you’re now asking: wait, why do I put up with that? A pal of mine once described his version of your decades-long frenemy: “If it weren’t for the fact that I am her friend, I’d never choose to be.” At that juncture, the thing to do is make a deliberate choice: keep them as a friend, or don’t. Either option can make you happy – the key is to make it an act of resolution, a conscious decision. Once you’ve taken a clear-eyed look at the things they tend to do and say and decided you’ll put up with those patterns for this or that reason, you can meditate on those reasons when they disappoint you in exactly the way you knew they would. Knowing why you’ve chosen to put up with something makes it easier to endure the actual task – it’s the social analogue of how people are much more likely to stick to tough habits like going to the gym if they keep mentally reminding themselves of why they’re doing it. Of course, you don’t have to maintain your friendship. If you wanted to quietly fade this woman out, you could. People drift; it doesn’t need to be a big confrontation. But you sound kind enough to find that a rude prospect, and you may be right that your company does her good, even if she doesn’t show it. So if you decide you’re not going to cut her out, the challenge is to get yourself into a position where her reliable patterns of behaviour don’t end up reliably hurting you. I heard this phrase recently and liked it very much: you have to have an emotional raincoat. One way to take the sting out of an insult is to practice seeing it as nothing more than a piece of evidence about the person who said it. They say something undermining or sarcastic, for instance, and although their literal words are about you, they’re unwittingly telling you about themselves. They’re expressing a wish that you come down a notch in the conversation, or hoping you will see them as a source of some power or knowledge that you lack. Even when she doesn’t recognise the cue for a hug, all she’s giving you is evidence that she doesn’t have that capacity for warmth. “Evidentialising” people’s behaviour like this can make it easier to keep yourself arm’s length from the hurt. If that doesn’t work, tell her straight that it stings when she reacts like this. Friendship might not keep a record of wrongs, but if she cares about keeping this one, she will care about the record of hurt. Do you have a conflict, crossroads or dilemma you need help with?

3/25/2022,"After nine years, having borne witness to an immeasurable toll on human life, having poured hundreds of millions of dollars into a failing system, and after repeated international condemnation, Australia has belatedly accepted New Zealand’s resolute offer – an almost nagging entreaty – to resettle 150 refugees from Australia’s punitive offshore processing system, every year, for three years. The offer has been on the table since 2013 – politely but persistently put by three New Zealand prime ministers to five Australian ones. For years Australia maintained that refugees held by Australia on offshore Pacific islands could never be resettled in New Zealand. New Zealand was a “pull factor”, Peter Dutton said. “It could risk this thing opening up again,” according to Scott Morrison. It was argued that New Zealand was a “back door” to entry to Australia. It was always a specious argument: Australia regularly prevents New Zealanders it doesn’t want from entering Australia. If the Covid pandemic and the Novak Djokovic spectacle proved anything, it was that Australia could, and would, stop people it didn’t want at its borders, even its own citizens. Over years, as offshore processing ground on, and the people held within it ground down, the offer was repeatedly put … and rebuffed. Deals, Australia said, were being sought with other “third countries” to resettle refugees: the champagne-spilling catastrophe of Cambodia; the slow, unpredictable US resettlement deal. A lucky few found ways out. Behrouz Boochani got a visa to New Zealand for a writers’ festival. Javiet Ealom escaped Manus. Others found sponsors in Europe. Australian people raised more than $4m to sponsor people held by Australia’s offshore system to resettle in Canada. And now, it seems, New Zealand is OK. The deal announced on Thursday will see New Zealand take 150 refugees from Australia’s offshore cohort for each of the next three years. That 450 will not clear the number of people still held within Australia’s system. There are a little over 100 people currently on Nauru, who will be prioritised for this deal. Fifty-one eligible refugees are in detention in Australia, and just over 1,100 are in the Australian community – but, the government says, with no opportunity to stay here permanently. Those people are also eligible to apply for New Zealand resettlement. The Guardian understands there are 105 refugees and asylum seekers held on Papua New Guinea. While they are excluded from the Australia-New Zealand deal, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea have made it clear that, through the UN’s refugee agency, they will negotiate – without Australia – for the potential resettlement of refugees from Port Moresby to New Zealand. The UNHCR deal – promoted by the Australian government as “demonstration work on this is currently under way” – explicitly says there will be a separate stream for those currently in limbo in PNG. But the architecture of offshore detention remains. “Australia’s strong border protection policies have not changed,” the home affairs minister, Karen Andrews, said on Thursday. “People who come to Australia … by boat will never be allowed to settle here.” Australia has signed an agreement with Nauru for an “enduring” offshore processing regime in that country. Offshore processing’s great political potency was its promotion by successive governments as having successfully “stopped the boats”. It did not do this. In the first full year after offshore processing was reintroduced, government figures show more people arrived in Australia by boat seeking asylum than at any other time in history or since (overwhelming within three months, in fact, the capacity of the offshore detention centres Australia had built). It was physically intercepting boats, turning their desperate passengers back at sea – often returning them to harm without proper consideration of their claim for asylum – that was the key driver in stopping the boats. No new asylum seeker or refugee has been sent to offshore processing since 2014. But the adamantine adherence to offshore detention, in spite of all the evidence of the damage it was doing, has weakened Australia internationally, damaged its reputation and influence. Australia has been castigated at international forums for its abuses of human rights: efforts to hold other countries to account have been met with admonishments to worry about our own backyard. Offshore processing has also warped Australia’s relationships with the two countries browbeaten into accepting refugees from Australia. Australia’s self-image is firmly rooted in its recent history as a former British colony, but it was a coloniser too. Its two former colonies are no coincidence: PNG and Nauru. Australia’s opposition to New Zealand’s longstanding offer has softened incrementally. Over recent months, the deal was in discussion, then being negotiated, then imminent. The machinations, like so much of Australia’s asylum policy, have been opaque, sclerotic and undertaken with almost no consideration for those most affected by them: those held on offshore islands, counting off not in days or months the time spent in the damaging uncertainty, but years. There were a number of factors driving the current government’s change of position. Behind the scenes, there was lobbying from moderate Liberal party members – with an eye on the upcoming election and threatened by well-funded progressive independents certainly – but also from a conviction that the policy could no longer be rationally argued to serve any purpose, was callously cruel and deliberately punitive. The US refugee swap had essentially run its course, having taken more than 1,200 people from Australia’s detention system for new lives there. The financial cost became unjustifiable. Nauru, acutely, became obscenely expensive. On the government’s own figures, Australian taxpayers were paying more than $4.3m a year for every single refugee held on the island – nearly $12,000 every day for each person detained. And public pressure remained steadfast. While asylum faded as a frontline political issue, advocacy groups, human rights organisations and refugees who’d found their way out of the regime themselves kept quietly insisting upon meetings with ministers, kept loudly taking to the streets, kept camping out in MPs’ offices. There are some sent to Australia’s offshore detention regimes on Nauru and PNG for whom this deal means nothing: it is all too late. Reza Berati was murdered by the men paid to protect him; Hamid Kehazaei died from reprehensible medical neglect; Omid Masoumali despaired to the point of setting himself alight publicly in protest. Children were beaten and sexually abused in the Australian-run camps on Nauru – the regime’s own reports bear testament to it. Scores of others suffered irreparable mental harm. All of that need not have happened. All of that happened over the past nine years.",News/Australia news,Australia’s offshore detention regime caused nine years of unnecessary and irreparable harm | Ben Doherty,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/australias-offshore-detention-regime-caused-nine-years-of-unnecessary-and-irreparable-harm
3/25/2022,"Emma Raducanu’s tough education in her maiden WTA Tour season continued on Thursday as she served for the match in her Miami Open debut and stood within two points of victory against Katerina Siniakova but failed to take any of her ample opportunities, eventually suffering a bitter 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 loss in the second round. As Raducanu stumbled, Heather Watson pieced together one of her biggest wins in many years, grinding through a gruelling third set and demonstrating ample resilience by defeating Elina Svitolina, the 15th seed, 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4) to reach the third round. For Raducanu, the 11th seed, her defeat played out in remarkably similar fashion to her loss in the Indian Wells third round two weeks ago. Raducanu was dominant throughout the first half of the match, controlling the majority of exchanges from inside the baseline, taking the ball early off both wings and attacking freely as she established a 6-3, 3-1 lead. But Raducanu has struggled to play at a consistent, high intensity throughout an entire match this year. In most of her matches so far, including on Thursday, she has started extremely well, only for her intensity, serve and ball speeds to slow down. At the top level of professional tennis, opponents will always be ready to pounce. From a set and a break down, Siniakova, ranked 53rd in singles and the doubles world No 1, quickly worked herself into the match. After recovering the break, she ended the set close to the baseline and cranking up the pace of her forehand. Raducanu did not relinquish the match without some admirable fight, however, and she reeled off three games in a row just as the match seemed to be slipping away at 2-3, 15-30 in the third set. As in her Indian Wells loss to Petra Martic, she served for the match at 5-4 but she could not hold her nerve. After netting an easy forehand at 30-30, Raducanu struck her only double fault of the match on break point. Once again, Raducanu ended the match by conceding three consecutive games and her Czech opponent moved on. With her hard-court season at an end, Raducanu will now head to the clay and she is scheduled to start by leading Great Britain in their Billie Jean King Cup tie against Siniakova’s Czech Republic. More firsts await Raducanu as, if she plays, it will mark her Billie Jean King Cup debut and a first ever professional match on clay. Meanwhile, Watson’s hard fought victory over Svitolina marks her first top 20 win since January 2020 and her 10th in 52 career matches against the top 20. It has come at a most opportune moment. After a tough 18 months following the Covid hiatus in 2020, Watson recently fell out of the top 100. Her two victories now put her on the verge of returning to the top 100 and she will next face either Belinda Bencic or Marta Kostyuk. Earlier in the day, Naomi Osaka easily outplayed Angelique Kerber 6-2, 6-3, producing her best performance and victory in over a year. Against a fellow former No 1 and multiple grand slam champion, Osaka controlled the match from the beginning, serving extremely well and completely overpowering Kerber to register her first top-15 victory since winning the 2021 Australian Open. As Osaka bounces back from a well-publicised setback in Indian Wells two weeks ago, during which she was tearful after being heckled by a fan, she said that the incident convinced her to see a therapist for the first time, who has provided her with strategies to manage her emotions during her matches. The move was spurred by her concerned sister, Mari, after Indian Wells and she has received support from her coach, Wim Fissette: “Wim kind of put it in a really good way. He was like, you hire a coach for tennis, for fitness. The mind is such a big thing. If you can, like, get a professional to help you out 0.5%, that alone is worth it,” said Osaka.",Sport/Sport,Emma Raducanu’s struggles continue with loss to Katerina Siniakova in Miami,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/24/emma-raducanus-struggles-continue-with-loss-to-katerina-siniakova-in-miami
3/25/2022,"The Liberal senator Andrew Bragg has shown a “disdain” for free speech that “smacks of autocracy” in threatening legal action against a website that purports to explain MPs’ voting records, the Institute of Public Affairs has said. The OpenAustralia Foundation has rejected threatened legal action from Bragg over publication of his record on its site, They Vote For You, as “ludicrous”. Bragg this week engaged legal counsel to demand the foundation amend the website “to accurately reflect [his] voting patterns”, claiming failure to do so may constitute “misleading and deceptive” conduct. The website uses a mathematical formula by scoring MPs’ actions – either voting for, against or abstaining from a vote – to generate an assessment between “votes consistently for” or “consistently against” an issue. Bragg and fellow Liberal moderate Dave Sharma have criticised the website for reporting they had voted against protections for LGBTQ people, despite being strong voices for such protections in parliament. Sharma crossed the floor in parliament to vote with Labor for an amendment to protect LGBTQ+ students in the religious discrimination bill in February, while Bragg signalled he would do the same thing before it was ultimately pulled from the Senate schedule. The Liberal MPs claimed the website was “partisan” and Bragg unsuccessfully tried to have it stripped of its charity status last year. After receiving the legal demand, the foundation’s lawyers reportedly responded that there was “no cause of action” because the foundation is not engaged in “trade or commerce”. It said it stood by its work, and claimed confusion on Bragg’s voting record stemmed from issues inside parliament itself that needed urgent reform. The chief executive of the Institute of Public Affairs, John Roskam, said Bragg’s action against the website “seems to be another example of Coalition’s disdain for the principle of free speech and free political debate”. Roskam cited Bragg’s threat and an unrelated complaint by the Liberal senator Sarah Henderson about the charitable status of the Parenthood Project as examples of government figures engaging in an “arbitrary and draconian overreaction” by targeting groups “for their vigorous opposition to the Coalition”. “This is not the question of condoning unlawful activity. It is a question of attempting to censor political debate.” Roskam warned that such efforts “weaken democracy” because they set a “dangerous precedent for a potential Labor government to follow by targeting, for example, those who question the efficacy of Covid control measures or the impact of climate change”. “What they’re talking about smacks of autocracy much more than democracy.” Bragg rejected the criticism. “They’re entitled to their opinion … but I don’t agree with that analysis,” he told Guardian Australia. OpenAustralia Foundation co-founder Matthew Landauer said he stood by the website’s formula for calculating a politician’s support for an issue, which he said was “open and transparent”. He explained that an MP’s stance on a “substantive” vote was weighted more heavily than non-substantive votes, such as minor procedural motions. “We’re confident our methodology is a good one,” he said. “It applies exactly the same to every member of parliament – there’s no bias in the process.” Landauer said the site showed how a politician actually voted, not what their public remarks or intentions were. He said the stoush with Bragg and Sharma made the case for reforming how parliament managed and recorded votes in the chamber, saying procedural quirks such as passing a motion “on the voices” – that is, without a formal voting record being taken – made it more difficult to track an individual’s behaviour. “We need to make some sort of concerted push on some level to get parliament to improve its parliamentary record of voting. So many votes happen on the voices, you can’t figure out who voted each way or if they are in the room at the time,” Landauer said. “[This] is a fundamental problem and a huge gap in the parliamentary record. The work we’ve done has made that all the more obvious to a lay person. “We need a complete record of all votes that lists how every single MP votes on every single vote.” Bragg said the website’s records “don’t correspond with the official record maintained by parliament”. “It is wrong, misleading and debases public debate,” he said. “They Vote For You is trying to reduce a very important and complex Westminster system into oversimplified captions and graphics. It’s devoid of any nuance or context and uses hyperbole to promote a partisan objective.” Bragg insisted consumer law would apply to the foundation, citing its “corporate activities” such as soliciting donations. Landauer said his legal team had responded to Bragg’s lawyers and was waiting for a further response.",News/Australia news,Liberal Andrew Bragg accused of showing ‘disdain’ for free speech with legal threat to They Vote For You site,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/liberal-andrew-bragg-accused-of-showing-disdain-for-free-speech-with-legal-threat-to-they-vote-for-you-site
3/25/2022,"A legal service designed to protect Aboriginal people who are taken into police custody in the Northern Territory will run out of funding in three months. The custody notification service, run by the Northern Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (Naaja), was established in 2019 and received three years’ funding from the federal government, on the understanding that the NT government would take over paying for the service from 2022 onward. But no funding agreement has been signed. Stephen Karpeles, who manages the service at Naaja, said that a failure to provide long-term funding arrangements, particularly in the wake of the high-profile acquittal of an NT police officer over the fatal shooting of an Aboriginal man, would “say fairly clearly that black lives don’t matter”. “The whole point of the service is to recognise the importance of protecting Aboriginal people when they’re in police custody,” he said. “To remove the funding for the service at a time when Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are already very apprehensive about their relationship with police would send completely the wrong message.” The custody notification service is a 24/7 telephone line that police are required to ring if they take an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person into custody. It conducts a welfare check and provides legal advice. This is particularly necessary in the NT, says Karpeles, because it is the only Australian jurisdiction where police are not required to expressly tell people in custody they have a right to see a lawyer. A spokesperson for the federal minister for Indigenous affairs, Ken Wyatt, said his government was “considering its position on the future funding of Custody Notification Services, which will be communicated to providers and key stakeholders in due course”. They reiterated that the initial funding offer was for three years. A spokesperson for the Northern Territory attorney general, Selena Uibo, said the Territory “continues to lobby the federal government for funding for this program”. In 2016 the Australian government offered to fund the first three years of Custody Notification Services in each state and territory without an existing service. This offer was conditional on jurisdictions mandating police use of the CNS in legislation and a commitment by jurisdictions to take on full funding responsibility after the first three years. The Northern Territory and Western Australia governments agreed to the offer. In the NT, the CNS has assisted more than 16,000 people in the past three years, including children as young as 10. It has six full-time staff. Naaja said it needed to hire more staff to meet demand, but hiring skilled staff on a three-month contract was difficult. Karpeles said changes to the bail act, introduced last May, had seen a tripling of the number of children under 12 who were taken into custody, and a doubling of children aged 12 to 18. Those changes were introduced following a series of news reports about an alleged youth crime wave. The huge jump in children being detained made the service even more important, said Karpeles. “Our service has been in operation for three years and we’re required to be notified every time a youth is arrested – an Aboriginal youth, that is,” he said. “We were not seeing this increase that was being spoken about in our data. It just simply wasn’t there. But now that the bail laws have been amended we have seen a huge increase – a doubling across youths and a tripling of youths under 12.” The Northern Territory has the highest rates of Indigenous incarceration in the country, and it’s geographically complicated. People are often arrested and removed from their home community, or told to attend court in a regional centre when they don’t have access to transport. It’s also a multilingual community, and there’s no legal requirement for police to provide access to a translator. Through the CNS, Naaja is able to ensure the person under arrest understands their rights and also what is expected of them in terms of future court dates and bail conditions. “We are speaking to people for whom English is a fourth or fifth language all the time – probably every second or third person we speak to,” Karpeles said. Placing a legislative requirement on police to contact the local Aboriginal legal service whenever a First Nations person was taken into custody was a recommendation of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody in 1991. It was introduced in NSW in 2000 and in 2016 the federal government promised three years of federal funding to other jurisdictions which introduced the scheme.

Victoria signed up shortly after, and last year the federal government confirmed it had signed a $3.1m deal to establish a custody notification service in South Australia. Queensland and Tasmania declined to adopt the program, saying they have other welfare mechanisms in place. The Aboriginal legal service in Western Australia said its funding was also due to expire in June, and it had not received any information about funding being extended. “It is the State Government’s expectation that the Commonwealth will announce ongoing Federal Government funding for the Custody Notification Service, with an announcement due in April,” WA attorney general, John Quigley, said.",News/Australia news,Funding for NT legal service helping Indigenous Australians in custody set to run out in three months,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/25/funding-for-nt-legal-service-helping-indigenous-australians-in-custody-set-to-run-out-in-three-months
