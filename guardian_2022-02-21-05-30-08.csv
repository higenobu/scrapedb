2/21/2022,"Good morning. There will be excitement at airports today as Australia’s international border reopens to vaccinated travellers, nearly two years after the border closed to help stop coronavirus from spreading. Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron have agreed to try to secure a ceasefire in the east of Ukraine and to put together an urgent summit at the highest level on the future of the country, the Élysée Palace said in a statement. The two leaders spoke on the phone for 105 minutes, and the outcome, broadly confirmed by the Kremlin, suggests Russia might be willing to step back from the brink of a full invasion of Ukraine to allow renewed diplomatic discussions. Meanwhile, Russian troops sent to Belarus for military exercises will remain in the country indefinitely, Belarus’s defence ministry has said, in a decision that will further fuel concerns Moscow is planning an imminent Ukraine invasion.  The messaging around the severity of the Omicron Covid variant and a degree of pandemic fatigue is slowing Australia’s booster rollout, as some Australians shun the third dose. The Burnet Institute epidemiologist, Mike Toole, said this time the slow rollout could not be put down to supply issues. “The messaging around Omicron, that it is mild, has inhibited the uptake of boosters for adults and first and second doses for kids,” Toole said. “I think that’s been quite dangerous. The country had 66 deaths on Thursday, 64 on Wednesday, 46 on Tuesday. That’s still a lot of deaths.” The Queen has tested positive for Covid-19, ahead of the expected ending of all coronavirus restrictions in England in the coming days. Buckingham Palace said the monarch, 95, was experiencing “mild cold-like symptoms” but expected to continue carrying out light duties this week. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson said the country is “in a different world” from when the Covid pandemic started, meaning the last remaining restrictions can begin to be lifted from next week. Ahead of an announcement on Monday about the government’s “living with Covid” strategy, the prime minister signalled free mass testing would end imminently and told people to return to the office and “get their confidence back”. Australia’s largest immigration detention centre is “awash with drugs”, sources inside the Villawood detention centre say, with several detailing an extensive drug-smuggling operation. Tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and the Canadian asset management giant Brookfield have launched an extraordinary joint bid to take over AGL Energy, Australia’s most polluting company, with the goal to shut its coal power plants earlier than planned. The first travellers in nearly two years are on their way to Australia, but tourism operators say it could be more than a year before they truly return to business as usual. A historic decision by the Lismore city council to hand back land to First Nations people will proceed, despite a contentious motion by a newly elected councillor to halt the return of 37 hectares at the southern end of Sleeping Lizard Hill, or North Lismore Plateau. Large parts of the United Kingdom were braced for another day of travel chaos and power cuts on Monday as Storm Franklin brought hurricane-force winds and flooding in the wake of the deadly Storm Eunice. Hundreds of families in south Manchester were urged to evacuate their homes on Sunday night while nearly 80,000 households remained without power following the worst UK storm in decades. The Italian ambassador to Australia has died after falling from a balcony in her home town in Foligno in the Umbria region. Victims of a French modelling agent’s alleged sexual abuse have expressed shock and dismay after he was found dead in his cell, in an apparent echo of the prison suicide of his close associate, the disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein.

As the new Lord of the Rings series gears up for its September launch on Amazon, the company finds itself navigating treacherous, if familiar, waters and has already triggered a fierce debate over race by introducing characters of colour into JRR Tolkien’s fantasy world. Companies are facing increasing consumer and shareholder pressure to ensure the investments they make are ethical. But how do they define what’s ethical? There is no hard and fast definition of what makes an investment ethical. Knowing how your investments are screened, though, is a good start. Cillian Murphy’s icy stare has transfixed viewers around the world as Brummie gang boss Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders. As the stellar series reaches its finale, he talks about music, empathy and trying not to overthink things For months Prince Andrew has been clear about the accusations of sexual assault he faced from Virginia Giuffre: they were baseless and he would fight them all the way in court. In the past week he agreed to a settlement that states he had “never intended to malign Ms Giuffre’s character” and that he recognised she had “suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks”. Andrew also pledged to “demonstrate his regret for his association” with the sex offender financier Jeffrey Epstein. The surprise out-of-court agreement means Prince Andrew makes no admission of guilt over the claims. He has always denied the allegations.

2/21/2022,"Labour has accused Boris Johnson of creating a “cash-for-access culture” in the Conservative party after it emerged that a secret advisory board of wealthy donors were regularly invited to private briefings with the prime minister and his top team. Concerns were raised when the Sunday Times reported that members of the board, whose investments spanned property, construction and big tobacco, lobbied the government to provide more support for their businesses during the Covid crisis.  A witness was quoted by the paper saying that the donors believed their advice and the concerns “would go straight up to the PM”. It was also claimed that board members were granted the contact details of ministers and advisers, which they used to discuss the pandemic strategy and procurement offers – as well as make requests for help and advice on applying for public appointments. There were 12 figures named who had been invited to meetings since the Covid-19 crisis began in March 2020, including Lubov Chernukhin, a former banker who is the wife of Vladimir Putin’s former deputy finance minister Vladimir Chernukhin. In total, the board members were said to have donated £22m to the Conservatives, including £9.9m since Johnson became prime minister less than two years ago. The two figures central in putting the board together and maintaining its access were named by the Sunday Times as Lord Lister, Johnson’s former chief strategic adviser, and Ben Elliot, the Conservative party’s co-chair. Lister and Elliot have been contacted for comment. After the government promised a crackdown on money laundering from Russian oligarchs in light of the escalating military tensions in Ukraine, Labour accused the Conservatives of having “ignored warnings about how Russian money and influence is used in the UK”. Anneliese Dodds, Labour’s chair, said the UK had become “a laundromat for kleptocrats’ dirty money” and that “our institutions have been damaged and an entire cottage industry has grown up dedicated to lobbying for and protecting those close to the Kremlin”. In a letter to Johnson, which was seen by the Guardian, Dodds disparaged the “ethical standards in your party” and said the media report over the weekend “raises serious questions about the cash for access culture that you have created at the heart of government”. Dodds said Johnson had allowed Elliot to “blur the lines between private business activities and his public responsibilities in order to boost Tory coffers”. Given concerns about the source of the money donated to the Conservative party, Dodds said Johnson should “return every penny of the millions of pounds of Russian-linked cash that has been donated to your party and its MPs since 2019 – including any received from advisory board donors – and reverse your plans to allow unlimited donations from abroad”. Dodds also called for Elliot to be fired and told Johnson he should get his “own house in order and restore public confidence that your party is committed to cleaning up its act”. Downing Street and the Conservative party were contacted for comment. A spokesperson for the Conservatives told the Sunday Times: “We can confirm that, on occasion, senior Conservative politicians, just like senior Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians, do in fact attempt to raise funds for the party they represent.”",News/Politics,Labour accuses Boris Johnson of creating a ‘cash-for-access culture’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/20/labour-accuses-boris-johnson-of-creating-a-cash-for-access-culture
