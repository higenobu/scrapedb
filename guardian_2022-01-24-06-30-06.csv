1/24/2022,"An injury-time strike from US forward Tobin Heath salvaged a point for Arsenal against Manchester City at the Academy Stadium. The World Cup winner’s 92nd-minute goal came after controversy in the buildup to Khadija Shaw’s opener had marred Manchester City’s controlled performance against the dominant league leaders. The Arsenal manager, Jonas Eidevall, was shown a yellow card in his second consecutive game, having also collected one during Arsenal’s midweek League Cup defeat to Manchester United, for protesting the heavy deflection off the referee that allowed winger Lauren Hemp to race free before sending in a low cross for Shaw to tap in.  Arsenal may have been top of the league, six points ahead of their opponents and had enjoyed an emphatic 5-0 win in the reverse fixture. But the context could not have been more different going into the game at the wind tunnel that is the Academy Stadium. Arsenal had only one win, against relegation battling Leicester, in their preceding six games, conceding 14 and scoring five, with four of those goals coming in that solo win and the fifth an own goal scored by Hoffenheim. Meanwhile, Gareth Taylor’s City had overcome an injury-crippling start to go on a six-game winning run and have been boosted by the return of defensive duo Lucy Bronze and Steph Houghton. After scoring 11 goals in their first seven league games of the season, City had scored 17 times in their four games prior to the visit of Arsenal. In the midweek game Arsenal were boosted by the return of influential centre-back Leah Williamson, who injured a hamstring in their 1-1 draw with Tottenham on 13 November, and Heath who has spent much of the season on the sidelines. Both made a huge impact off the bench and the former was deemed fit enough to start against City. Buoyed, perhaps, by the improvement shown in the performance against United which Eidevall described as “a big step forward”, the returning players and the new faces of defenders Rafaelle Souza, Laura Wienroither and forward Stina Blackstenius, it was Arsenal that would press with greater intensity and edge control in the middle of the park. However, City threatened on the break and Arsenal struggled to handle the pace and verve of Hemp and Jess Park, playing on either side of centre-forward Shaw. There was a nervy moment for Arsenal just past an half hour as play paused and Williamson sat on the ground. She was deemed well enough to continue but at half time was hooked in favour of debutant Souza, the first Brazilian to play for Arsenal’s women’s team. Arsenal continued to press and ease forward but struggled to find the final pass or a clean opportunity to shoot. Both Vivianne Miedema and Beth Mead would force saves from Khiara Keating from the left but the angle was tight and the saves were routine. It would be a characteristic Hemp run that would provide the breakthrough, the forward sending in a cross that would be tapped beyond Manuela Zinsberger by Shaw. It was not without controversy though, as the ball deflected off the referee, changing the run of the pass to Hemp. FA rules state that play should be stopped if the ball hits the referee. City still looked the more dangerous side despite Arsenal pouring forward in the six minutes added on at the end. However a long ball into the City box bounced around the penalty area before it fell to Heath at the back post to convert. Arsenal move two points clear of Manchester United, who have played a game more, and four of holders Chelsea, who have a game in hand over Arsenal and two over United. Meanwhile, City stay fifth, one point behind Tottenham.",Sport/Football,Tobin Heath’s late strike gives Arsenal crucial point at Manchester City,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/23/manchester-city-arsenal-wsl-match-report
1/24/2022,"Allegations by the former Conservative minister Nusrat Ghani that she was sacked for being Muslim has reignited accusations that the party is institutionally Islamophobic. Ghani, who was the first Muslim woman to speak from the Commons dispatch box, sent shockwaves across the country this weekend when she alleged in a Sunday Times interview that her “Muslimness” was raised when she was removed from a ministerial job in 2020, and said she was told it was “making colleagues uncomfortable”.  The allegations follow what campaigners describe as decade-long fight to get the Conservative party to take these allegations seriously and root out Islamophobia. Campaigners warn little will change unless there is an independent investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) into Islamophobia and the party adopts the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims’ definition on Islamophobia. In March 2019, the Guardian revealed how 15 Conservative councillors who were suspended over posting Islamophobic or racist content online had their membership quietly reinstated. Some had described Saudis as “sand peasants” or shared material comparing Asian people to dogs. In April 2019, the Guardian exposed how two Conservative local election candidates and a woman honoured with an MBE were among 40 new self-professed Tory members who shared or endorsed racist and inflammatory Facebook posts, including Islamophobic material. Muslims had been described as “bin bag-wearing individuals” and there had been calls for the “cult” of Islam to be banned. In the same month, it emerged that Ghani had been bombarded with emails from a Conservative activist praising Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech. In September 2020, a poll commissioned by the anti-racism organisation Hope Not Hate found that almost half of Conservative party members believed Islam “a threat to the British way of life”; more than a third of card-carrying Tories believed that Islamist terror attacks reflected a widespread hostility to Britain among the Muslim community and nearly six in 10 thought “there are no-go areas in Britain where sharia law dominates and non-Muslims cannot enter”. In response to Ghani’s allegations, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was “now time” for the EHRC to investigate the party, to determine if any breaches of the law have taken place. Its call for an external, independent investigation was echoed by other anti-racist organisations. “Ten years ago, Baroness Warsi, another prominent female member of the Tory party, made a very pertinent comment about how Islamophobia passed the dinner table test. She said on the dinner table you could discuss football, you could discuss the weather and be openly Islamophobic and it’ll be perfectly acceptable,” Shockat Patel, a board member of Muslim Engagement and Development (Mend), said. He added that for the party to be rocked by more allegations of Islamophobia by another Muslim woman shows that “no lessons have been learned. Islamophobia is still alive and kicking within the Tory party.” Patel said the party is well aware of the issue at hand. Mend submitted more than 100 cases to the Tory party from organisations during its investigation into Islamophobia. The long-awaited review into Islamophobia in the Conservative party, chaired by Prof Swaran Singh, was published in May 2021. It was immediately condemned as a whitewash by Muslim Tories. While many welcomed its conclusion that anti-Muslim sentiment “remains a problem” within the party, they disagreed with the review’s conclusion that there was no evidence of institutional racism. Sajjad Karim, a former Tory MEP, claimed in June 2021 that Muslim members of the Conservative party were deliberately excluded from an inquiry into Islamophobia within its ranks and called for an external investigation into the party. At the time, Green Lane Masjid, one of the largest mosques in Europe, welcomed the comments by the Conservative party to start making tangible changes within its membership. But a spokesperson for the organisation said the failure by the Conservative party to since accept a definition for Islamophobia points to a deeper issue, one in which anti-Muslim hostilities are not allowed to be proactively identified and addressed. Mohammed Saeed, the chair of trustees at Green Lane Masjid, said: “It is our responsibility to campaign against all forms of racism and inequality so that the current and future institutional systems being implemented by our government do not unfairly discriminate against or harm people. “Racism at all levels robs people of equality. If accusations of racism exist in the corridors of power within our country, we have a responsibility to have them properly investigated.”",News/Politics,Nusrat Ghani’s allegations reignite claims that Tory party is Islamophobic,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/nusrat-ghanis-allegations-reignite-claims-that-tory-party-is-islamophobic
1/24/2022,"Sam Billings knows exactly when he was last at home, though the memory is increasingly distant. It was 20 September 2021, two days after he captained Kent to victory in the Vitality Blast. “After that I went Indian Premier League, World Cup, holiday in the Maldives for a week where I got engaged to my other half, Sarah – I haven’t seen her since – and then Big Bash, then Test match, then here.” These have been four whirlwind months, culminating most recently in a nine-hour, 820km drive from his BBL assignment on Australia’s Gold Coast to join England’s Ashes squad in Tasmania for his Test debut, followed a few days later by a marathon journey to join the Twenty20 side in Barbados via stop-offs in Sydney, Los Angeles and Miami. “I’ve tried to work out how long the journey took about four times,” he says. “The amazing thing was I took off at 11am on the 18th and I landed in LA at 8am the same day. I’d been on a plane for 15 hours. I don’t know what day it is. It’s just great to be here.”  What is particularly remarkable, given how much time he spends on international commitments, is how little international cricket Billings has played. England’s shambolic defeat to West Indies in the first of five T20s on Saturday night was the 30-year-old’s 60th international appearance in all formats, spread across – excluding one-off matches – 30 different series and nearly seven years. He has constantly been asked to score runs without ever being given one. “Being the age I am now, I’ve got a really good idea of where my game’s at, and what I need to do to be ready,” he says. “The franchise world, I know it’s spoken about really badly by some people but actually it teaches you as a player to be self-sufficient. You work out pretty quickly that you can’t have everything you want, and you have to figure out what you need to get yourself ready to perform in a very short space of time.” But there has not been a great deal of consistency in his recent international outings, either of selection or output: after Saturday night Billings’ past five international innings had come in three different formats across seven months, and he had scored one, two, two, three and 29. But he arrived here buoyed by his performances in the BBL, where he averaged 40.57 in nine matches. “This is a really interesting time for me as a cricketer,” he says. “I feel like I’m playing my best cricket and moving forward I’ve just got to play. I can’t sit on the bench. I’ve done enough time doing that. I’ve been in and around the different environments and been a great squad player and actually done pretty well when I’ve stepped in, but clarity is a huge thing for me moving forward. “With the [Sydney] Thunder, you know you’re going to play this number of games, you know your role, you know you’re a senior player, and you get backed. And after a bit of backing, in terms of a run of games, I back myself to perform every single time. I think it’s the toughest thing to do, coming in and out of a squad. That’s why I was so forthright in saying I’d love to get out to the West Indies, because this is a run of games for me, something I’ve waited for.” He had to be similarly patient for a chance to play Test cricket before injuries to England’s first- and second-choice wicketkeepers opened a way into the team in Hobart. But unlike some England players Billings will feature in the Indian Premier League auction instead of opting to rest and focus on a red-ball summer. “I really want to give Tests a real good crack,” he says. “I suppose the challenge comes from a clarity point of view. I don’t know what’s going on. I’m not centrally contracted, I’ve never been centrally contracted, so it’s very hard to get that clarity as a player. I think central contracts give you real clarity to schedule what you can do for the year. I’ve never had that. Guys like myself, we have to keep our options open.” The next round of central contracts will be announced in October. Until then Billings will remain on standby, options open – and passport at the ready.",Sport/Sport,‘I can’t sit on the bench’: Sam Billings targets regular England role,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/sam-billings-targets-regular-england-role-cricket

1/24/2022,"At least they’ll always have Leicester. Even while they celebrated Wednesday’s sensational come-from-behind victory at the King Power, sensible Spurs fans – and their manager – knew it was most likely to be remembered as a joyous freak occurrence rather than the start of a new era.  In the excitement, that win was compared to Spurs’ magnificently ludicrous triumph over Ajax in the 2019 Champions League semi-final and it is true that the matches have similarities. Both created thrilling, enduring memories from improbable situations; and both were followed by monumental no-shows. Not that Tottenham were as flat at Stamford Bridge as they were against Liverpool in the Champions League final, but they did emit comparable signs of a team in need of renewal. Antonio Conte already knew that, just as Mauricio Pochettino did three years ago. The Italian will hope that this, his team’s third comprehensive defeat by Chelsea in a month, will convince the club that appointed him nearly three months ago to allow him to buy more quality. At Stamford Bridge, though, there was also further evidence that avoiding the transfer market can be a shrewd policy. At the start of the season Harry Kane and Romelu Lukaku were tipped to vie for the golden boot. Instead they have spent most of the campaign unwittingly serving as poster boys for prudence. So far Manchester City can feel smug about not agreeing to pay north of £120m for Kane’s services, while Lukaku’s performances since his £97.5m return to Chelsea have generally been an advertisement for focusing on youth. Lukaku, like Kane, has five league goals to his name this season, the same number that the 20-year-old Armando Broja has struck for Southampton while on loan from Chelsea. Tammy Abraham, though unlikely to develop into a top striker, would probably also have scored that many if he had not been packed off to Roma. Lukaku started the season deceptively well, feeding the tale of the happy homecoming by scoring in his first match, against Arsenal, as part of a performance that he described as “dominant”. His next goals came against Aston Villa. All very well, but it is telling that neither of the centre-backs he dominated in those matches – Arsenal’s Pablo Marí and Villa’s Axel Tuanzebe – still play in the Premier League, both having departed for Serie A, where Lukaku once thrived. There has, of course, been mitigation for Lukaku’s inadequate return so far, although it is surely a reflection of the absurd infantilisation of modern footballers that one preview of this game suggested that the 28-year-old deserves sympathy because he has suffered from “injury, illness and a controversial interview”. Speaking of speaking, Thomas Tuchel said in the run-up to this game that Lukaku and Kane would soon start scoring again “because that is what they do.’” Which rather missed the point of the question: that is not what they do much any more. Kane hinted in recent weeks at regaining sharpness, perhaps thanks to being honed by Conte. The striker suggested his whole team is benefitting from the manager’s methods, venturing immediately before taking on Chelsea that “with our physical condition we can take the game deep and see if we can win it in the second half”. That did not seem such a ridiculous hope given that Tuchel had attributed his team’s plodding draw with Brighton on Tuesday to mental and physical fatigue. But Chelsea proved to be a class above Spurs again. Lukaku and Kane, however, both remained below par. Lukaku had a chance to show his sharpness after just 42 seconds. But, after giving Eric Dier the slip to connect with Hakim Ziyech’s cross from the right, he slashed the ball over the bar from 10 yards. Kane’s first touch came two minutes later, when he received a pass just inside Chelsea’s half and tried to release Steven Bergwijn only to roll the ball to a defender. Lukaku worked hard and did his best to get involved but precision eluded him. In the 32nd minute he escaped defenders’ attentions after Chelsea made inroads down the right wing for the umpteeth time. Mason Mount supplied the Belgian with a perfect cross. Lukaku simultaneously swung a foot at it and took his eyes off it, the result a comical fresh-air shot. Other, harder chances followed but he could not get on the end of inviting crosses from Callum Hudson-Odoi and Antonio Rüdiger. Meanwhile, with Spurs’ emphasis on defence and Kane usually too slow to join in their rare counter-attacks, England’s captain contributed little. Until, that is, he spun and slotted the ball into the net. The referee ruled out the goal after spotting a foul on Thiago Silva, who probably exaggerated the harm done. Kane protested, at which point it would have been satisfying to see the referee direct Kane to a pitchside monitor to review the many times in his career that he has appealed for free kicks or penalties after innocent contact sent him flying. When the start of the second half was delayed so that groundsmen could repair a burst net, it seemed like someone was mocking the misfiring strikers. Thank goodness the game did resume, because within moments Ziyech produced a finish of incredible precision. With that Spurs’ resistance was over, and there was no comeback.",Sport/Football,Harry Kane and Romelu Lukaku provide no answers to owners’ striking questions | Paul Doyle,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/jan/23/harry-kane-and-romelu-lukaku-provide-no-answers-to-owners-striking-questions
