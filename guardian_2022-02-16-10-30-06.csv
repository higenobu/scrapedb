2/16/2022,"Over the past couple of days the camp behind the convoy to Canberra has slowly broken up. After an eviction notice from the ACT government the majority of protesters left on their own on Sunday, with a few holdouts finally forcefully evicted on Monday. Observing the livestream of those who tried to hold on, I and many others noticed a deep sense of despair. Much of this desperation came from an intense belief in the goals of the movement, and a promise that was made that the protests would keep going until these goals were met. But it was about a lot more than that. Throughout the event many participants spoke about the strength of community at camp, with some describing it as one of the best times they’d had in years, or even their entire life.  Observing this has led me to think about the convoy as being what theorists, including myself in my own PhD, describe as an “intimate public”. Intimate publics refer to groups who bond over a shared worldview and “emotional knowledge”. Individuals come together both through connections to ideas as well as through a collective feeling about their position in the world. They reject politics, believing they can change the world through the sheer force of their community and the feeling behind it. Intimate publics exist throughout our community, and this idea can be used to describe groups across the political spectrum. In her research, Lauren Berlant argued that the first intimate public was comprised of (primarily white) American women, who used texts such as romantic novels to create a collective complaint about their lives. Thinking about the convoy in this way provides valuable insights into the movement, how it formed and how we may respond to it. The makeup of the convoy was diverse and included those who are solely against mandates as well as anti-vaxxers, members of the far right, sovereign citizens and some grifters who were just there to make a buck. Community wasn’t central to everyone, with people turning up with disparate goals. Yet, elements of the convoy to Canberra certainly had many of the traits of an intimate public. Specifically, the movement was about more than just about ideology, but instead created a space in which individuals could be heard about their ideas and feelings of being shunned by society. Speakers on the stage did not just talk about their political beliefs, but also about their experiences of being critical of vaccines or mandates, and how they were rejected and ostracised by those around them because of these views. At one point a speaker asked the crowd: “How many of you have lost friends over your views?” Almost everyone put their hand up. In these movements this becomes reinforced by the creation and sharing of joint knowledge. Individuals share resources, ideas and materials, which become common texts through which they can understand the world. The convoy protests for example featured some doctors, nurses and other professionals who used the platform to speak out against vaccine mandates. Other protestors criticised those who disagreed with this view as being “fake news”. This approach separates them from the rest of the world, reinforcing a group sense of a shared worldview.

While I agree with some of their positions (I am critical of mandates), I also find the rhetoric and tactics of some very worrying. At the same time, I have despaired as I have watched how those around me have responded to these movements. Being condescending and talking about everyone in the convoy as a stupid moron who has been duped by disinformation will not achieve anything except to push people further into these spaces. These attacks reinforce a sense of the convoy being under siege from those around them, resulting in groups bunkering down rather than reaching out. This is particularly true when we fail to recognise the genuine fears many of these individuals hold. The last two years have seen a huge societal upheaval. Yet many have acted shocked when individuals have raised concerns about decisions made by governments. They were often screamed at and accused of wanting to “let it rip”. It is no surprise then that these individuals are more inclined towards movements where they feel that people empathise with and listen to them. If we want to understand the convoy and the movements around them, we need to grasp these group dynamics. People are not simply being “duped” by misinformation, and calling them “cookers” achieves nothing but making ourselves feel superior. Individuals are finding a community in a world that is often deeply lacking in it. Some of them are expressing genuinely held feelings that we must seek to understand and address rather than simply dismiss.

2/16/2022,"Australia is holding people in immigration detention for an average of 689 days, the highest on record and more than 12 times longer than the United States, according to Human Rights Watch, which has renewed calls for an end to the “harsh and unlawful policy”. The brief detention of tennis star Novak Djokovic in Melbourne’s Park Hotel recently brought global attention to Australia’s harsh immigration policies, but more than one month on, 32 refugees and asylum seekers remain in the same facility.  Home affairs department figures suggest 1,459 people are currently being held in various immigration detention facilities in Australia, including more than 70 refugees and asylum seekers transferred from Nauru and Manus Island. The average length of detention has increased to 689 days, vastly longer than comparable countries like the United States and Canada, where the averages are 55 days and 14 days respectively, Human Rights Watch says. Eight people have now spent more than 10 years in Australian immigration detention, and 117 have been detained for longer than five years. “It just shows how completely alone Australia is in the world, in terms of how absolutely horrific indefinite detention is, that there’s no end date,” Human Rights Watch Australia researcher Sophie McNeill said. “Other like-minded countries don’t do anything like us.” One of those still trapped in Melbourne’s Park Hotel is Mehdi Ali, who fled Iran as a child of 15, arriving by boat in Australia seeking sanctuary. Ali’s family, part of the persecuted Ahwazi Arab minority, urged him to flee in the hope he would find freedom in Australia. He was recognised as a refugee, meaning Australia owed him protection, but has since been detained for almost a decade across facilities on Nauru, in Brisbane, and now Melbourne’s notorious Park hotel. “The residents of this building are desperately in need of freedom,” Ali said. “Some of them think about committing suicide every night before they go to sleep.” The joint standing committee on migration is currently examining a bill to end indefinite and arbitrary immigration detention. Human Rights Watch has made a submission to the committee arguing community-based alternatives have been used across Europe with success. They also greatly reduce the costs to government. The government recently revealed it was costing more than $56,000 a night to house 32 refugees and asylum seekers in the Park Hotel in Melbourne. Labor said the government would save $19m by shifting the detainees into community detention, describing the ongoing cost as “an unbelievable waste of taxpayer money”. Elaine Pearson, Australia director at Human Rights Watch, said dismantling indefinite detention and shifting to community detention would bring Australia into line with its international obligations. “Detaining people solely due to their immigration status is harmful, expensive, and ineffective as a deterrent to migration,” Pearson said. “The Australian government should stop punishing those who may have fled violence and other injustices and offer rights-respecting alternatives to detention.”",News/Australia news,"Australia holding people in immigration detention for record 689 days on average, report finds",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/16/australia-holding-people-in-immigration-detention-for-record-689-days-on-average-report-finds
