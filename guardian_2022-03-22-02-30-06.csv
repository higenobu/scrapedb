3/22/2022,"UN member states have failed to agree on a treaty to protect the high seas from exploitation, with scientists, environmentalists and conservation organisations blaming states that were “dragging their feet” for the “glacial pace” of talks. The longer the negotiations took, the more wildlife would be lost from the ocean, they warned, urging ministers and heads of state to work together with the president of the UN high seas conference to speed up a further round of negotiations to close a “governance vacuum” on the high seas. Most of the ocean lies outside the exclusive economic zones controlled by individual states. Of this 64% of the high seas that lie beyond territorial limits, only 1.2% is now protected. One scientist described the treaty as the most significant ocean protection agreement in four decades. Known as the BBNJ (biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction) ocean treaty, its aim is to create a legal framework for establishing vast marine protected areas to prevent loss of wildlife, oversee industrial fishing, and share out the “genetic resources” of the sea. Dr Essam Mohammed, Eritrea’s representative in the negotiations and interim director general of WorldFish, a non-profit research institute, said: “At the moment, there is a governance vacuum in the high seas, and for the ocean and developing countries, the status quo simply isn’t an option.” Swiftly advancing marine technology would lead to “an unprecedented race for marine resources in unregulated waters”, Mohammed said. “The delay in striking a deal means high risk for the health of the ocean. “All member states of the UN need to recognise the urgency to save the ocean and the people who depend on it to survive,” he said. Prof Alex Rogers, a marine ecologist and science director of the non-profit company REV Ocean, said: “There are states here that are dragging their feet and deliberately prolonging the treaty [talks]. But we know the ocean is being degraded and is losing biodiversity. Climate is also having an impact on the ocean. The longer these negotiations are strung out, the more biodiversity we lose.” The negotiations, the fourth round since 2018, ended late on Friday without agreement and without a schedule set for further discussions. Rena Lee, the Singaporean president of the BBNJ conference, said: “I believe that with continued commitment, determination and dedication, we will be able to build bridges and close the remaining gaps.” It now rests with the United Nations general assembly to give the green light for another round of talks. Observers hope an agreement will be reached before the end of this year, and urged political leaders to work with the UN to make it happen. Last month, nearly 50 countries formed a “high-ambition coalition” at a French summit in Brest aimed at getting the deal done quickly. Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace, who attended last week’s talks, said: “If the high-ambition countries are serious about bringing the treaty to a close they need to work with President Rena Lee to address the painfully slow progress made in the last two weeks.” McCallum criticised the “glacial pace” of talks and said negotiators spent “hours and hours” on non-contentious sentences. “The majority of parties want to conclude by 2022,” he said. “But the longer it continues, the weaker it is going to get.” Some countries, including Russia and Iceland, have called for fisheries to be excluded from the agreement. Currently a patchwork of international bodies and treaties manage resources and human activity in areas beyond national jurisdiction – including fishing, whaling, shipping and seabed mining. However, they vary greatly in their mandates, and their jurisdictions often overlap. Despite two decades of discussion, there is still no treaty protecting international waters, making the establishment of marine protected areas or other safeguards legally challenging.",News/Environment,UN ocean treaty summit collapses as states accused of dragging out talks,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/21/un-ocean-treaty-summit-collapses-as-states-accused-of-dragging-out-talks
3/22/2022,"A Russian court has banned Facebook and Instagram in the country, labelling its parent company Meta as “extremist” amid the Kremlin’s sweeping crackdown on western social media giants. Access to Facebook and Instagram had already been restricted earlier this month after Meta confirmed it was relaxing its policies on hate speech towards Russian soldiers and Vladimir Putin in relation to the country’s war in Ukraine. Meta later said the laxer rules would only apply to people posting from inside Ukraine. The court in Moscow said that Facebook and Instagram –both of which are widely used among Russians – were “carrying out extremist activities”. But it said that Meta’s WhatsApp messenger service would not be prohibited because it “was means of communication, not a source of information”. During Monday’s hearing in Moscow, Russia’s FSB security service accused Meta of creating an “alternative reality” in which “hatred for the Russians was kindled”. “The activities of the Meta organisation are directed against Russia and its armed forces,” FSB representative Igor Kovalevsky told the court, the Russian state news agency TASS reported. Previously, groups such as the Taliban, Jehovah’s Witnesses and an organisation led by the jailed Kremlin opponent Aleksei Navalny have been targeted under the same extremism law. Russian prosecutors said in court they would not seek to charge Russian citizens and organisations that access the two banned platforms, as hundreds of thousands of Russians have sought to circumvent the social media ban using a VPN. “The use of Meta’s products by individuals and legal entities should not be considered as participation in extremist activities,” Kovalevsky told the court on Monday. “Individuals will not be held liable for using Meta’s services,” he added. It was not immediately clear if Russians and foreign companies that purchase ads on Facebook and Instagram could be prosecuted under the Russian law of “financing an extremist organisation”. According to TASS, Meta’s lawyer, Victoria Shagina had said in court that the corporation opposed any type of Russophobia and was not carrying out extremist activities. The move to label Meta as “extremist” comes as Russia continues its unprecedented crackdown on protesters, independent news outlets and foreign social media networks. Russian parliament earlier this month passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military. “Since the start of the special operation in Ukraine, the authorities have sought to fully control the information sphere in the country. We should be prepared for more censorship,” said Alexander Isavnin, a Russian internet privacy advocate and member of the Pirate Party of Russia. “The move to ban Meta is also a final warning sign to YouTube, the last major remaining western platform in the country,” Isavnin added, pointing to the recent criticism YouTube received from Russia’s communications regulator and politicians. Russia’s communication watchdog last Friday slammed YouTube for engaging in acts “of a terrorist nature” by allowing ads on the video-sharing platform to be used that could “harm Russian citizens”. “The actions of the YouTube administration are of a terrorist nature and threaten the life and health of Russian citizens,” the regulator said in a statement.",News/World news,Russia bans Facebook and Instagram under ‘extremism’ law,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/russia-bans-facebook-and-instagram-under-extremism-law
3/22/2022,"Labour has described the government’s approach to refugees as “deeply shameful” after ministers confirmed they are to stick with a planned law change that could potentially see Ukrainians who arrive in the UK without the correct visa jailed for four years. A number of Tory MPs could rebel on parts of the controversial nationality and borders bill, which returns to the Commons on Tuesday to consider a string of changes made by the House of Lords. While the Home Office has agreed to give way on a couple of amendments, it plans to push ahead again with plans for anyone who arrives in the UK by an unofficial route have their asylum claim immediately ruled as inadmissible, with the possibility of up to four years in jail, which peers had overturned. According to a Home Office briefing note for MPs, ministers will still pursue the idea of Australian-style offshore processing centres for refugees, and block other Lords amendments making it easier for families to be reunited, and for unaccompanied refugee children to come to the UK. The bill was last considered by MPs in December, and since then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has created an estimated 10 million new refugees in Europe, with more than 100,000 Britons signing up to a scheme to house people from the country. Yvette Cooper, Labour’s shadow home secretary, called for Tory MPs to push Priti Patel, the home secretary, into changing course. “It is unbelievable and deeply shameful that at a time like this Priti Patel is still pushing ahead with plans that could criminalise desperate Ukrainians who arrived in the UK with the wrong papers, and mean vulnerable refugees who have fled war or persecution could end up with prison sentences,” she said. “I hope Conservative MPs will join us in telling the government to think again. Britain is better than this.” A Home Office source rejected this, saying the purpose of the bill was to crack down on illicit, people smuggling-based routes, and would thus help free up resources for refugees such as those from Ukraine. While the government is not expected to lose any votes, there is disquiet among some Conservative backbenchers over several of the plans, including that to try and process asylum seekers overseas, a move critics say would be vastly expensive and deeply harmful. Another Lords amendment set to be overturned aimed to make it easier for asylum seekers to work while their claim is being processed. Currently they can only do so after 12 months, and only if the job is on a list of occupations for which there is a shortage. More than two dozen Tory MPs, including former ministers Robert Buckland, Andrew Mitchell, Karen Bradley and Stephen Crabb, have signed a letter to Boris Johnson put together by Conservative peer Philippa Stroud backing the idea of the occupations limit being lifted, with the time limit cut to six months. The letter argues that as well as asylum seekers being able to full jobs for which there are vacancies, evidence shows being in work helps them to integrate. Mitchell told the Guardian he was hoping ministers would listen on both overseas processing and employment, as well as another Lords amendment which has also been rejected, which would require the government to resettle at least 10,000 refugees in the UK every year. “We are trying to help the government achieve its purpose in this otherwise excellent bill,” Mitchell said. “The government should listen to parliament, rather than assume its contribution is antagonistic.” Another Lords change which the Home Office will seek to overturn is one led by law lords which sets out that nothing in the bill should contravene the UN’s 1951 refugee convention, to which the UK is a party. Although the UN refugee agency has warned it believes the bill is likely undermine the convention, ministers argue the amendment is not needed because “everything we are doing is compatible with all of our obligations under international law”. Cooper said: “Countries like Poland, Romania and Moldova are all doing their bit under the refugee convention to help Ukraine – yet instead of supporting that vital international collaboration, Conservative ministers are trying to rip the convention up.”",News/World news,"UK approach to refugees is ‘deeply shameful’, says Labour ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/uk-approach-ukrainian-refugees-shameful-says-labour
3/22/2022,"Earlier today I set you six puzzles that use a square piece of paper, in the light of new research saying that the best way to improve maths performance is to train ‘spatial reasoning’ using physical objects. 1. The triangle fold Fold a square paper in such a way that fold lines (and possibly an edge) mark an equilateral triangle. (Compass and ruler not allowed!) Solution Here is one way, that uses the side length of the square as the side length of the triangle. It is possible to fold a larger equilateral triangle – I’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader. Clue: the tip of the triangle is still a corner of the square, but the sides are folded at 15 degrees from the sides of the square. 2. The 3D shape Can you fold a square sheet of paper so that it makes a closed 3D shape, with no overlaps, gaps or extraneous flaps of paper? You cannot, for example, fold the square to make a cube since you will create an overlap or extra flaps. Solution Yes you can, and here is one: a pyramid with an isosceles triangle as a base. Hole punch puzzles For each of the next puzzles, you must take a square piece of paper and fold it, using as many folds as is needed, so that if you punch a single hole through the folded paper you will match the image when the paper is fully unfolded. 3 The X. Solution 4. The diagonal. Solution 5. The ring. Solution 6. A hole punch in the head. Solution The first fold divides the right 3/4 of the square into half.

3/22/2022,"If football’s self-appointed celebration police thought Arsenal’s players had overdone it on the happiness front after their 1-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday, the Fiver shudders to think of what they’d have made of the sight of assorted Barcelona players grinning maniacally, high-fiving each other and generally looking delighted with life last night. After all, ending a game 12 points behind the league leaders with just 10 games to go is nothing to get excited about unless it’s some kind of statement result. Well, if spanking four without reply past your bitterest rivals on their own patch isn’t a reason to be cheerful on a Sunday evening, then the Fiver doesn’t quite know what is. And that’s exactly what Barça did on their first visit to the Bernabéu under Xavi, swatting Real Madrid aside like they weren’t there. Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang scored twice, with Ronald Araújo and Ferran Torres bagging a goal apiece in a bona fide rout; the visitors could and probably should have scored several more. It wasn’t bad for a club who were in all sorts of turmoil before Xavi returned to manage the club six years after his 767th game for them as a player. Last night wasn’t just a welcome clásico win but an emphatic victory after five straight defeats and served up in a style the manager insists is non-negotiable. “We are back,” announced Gerard Piqué on social media in the game’s aftermath, in the kind of triumphant scenes last spotted online when Newcastle scraped a 1-0 win over Burnley back in December. “Maybe we can say we’re back,” said Xavi, who wasn’t quite as ready as his players to count his chickens. “This is the path to follow. This is the way we want to play. It was a complete performance. We were much better than Madrid. We played almost as the home team at their ground.” While Carlo Ancelotti could have been forgiven for giving it the full Frank Lampard by blaming Real Madrid’s defeat on his players and their perceived lack of cojones, that has never really been the Italian’s style so he selflessly threw himself under the bus. “It isn’t a problem for me to take responsibility,” he said, his eyebrow high in the night sky like the Wembley arch. “They played better than us. We wanted to control the ball more, to press them high, but it didn’t work ... it’s my fault. We weren’t recognisable. Everything went badly.” Badly for Real but swimmingly for Barça after their short-lived mini-crisis, but was it just one of those nights or a portent of things to come? “It is important to give people new opportunities and to turn the page” – Sven Jaecques, Antwerp’s general manager, said he had not specifically talked to female workers at his club about the decision to employ Marc Overmars a little over a month after he left his job at Ajax over inappropriate behaviour towards female colleagues. Get your ears around the latest edition of Football Weekly. “It’s well known both that Barcelona are on their uppers and that Arsenal are looking for a new striker. Barça have a stunningly successful goal-scorer, of international quality and with useful experience of the Premier League. Surely a deal could be struck?” – Charles Antaki. “Re teachers as football players: as a young Loons fan, I was a Station Park regular and a Forfar Academy High student before migrating to flamin’ Australia in the mid-1960s.

Graham Arnold, the Socceroos coach, has been fined by Football Australia for breaking Covid-19 protocols, taking a stroll at Narrabeen Beach on Sunday after testing positive on Thursday. Crystal Palace booked their place in the semi-finals of the FA Cup after thrashing Everton 4-0. Frank Lampard was not amused, lambasting his players in the process of accepting no responsibility whatsoever. Man City also reached the last four of the cup, three goals in the last half-hour seeing off Southampton. It’s been a difficult season for Leicester but they might just be on the way back, beating Brentford 2-1 thanks to goals from Timothy Castagne and James Maddison. Apparently there was a game in Madrid last night. Sid Lowe investigates the rumour. Two goals for Tammy Abraham – two more league goals than Romelu Lukaku has scored this year, stat fans – helped Roma to a derby win over Lazio. Nicky Bandini has more. Suzanne Wrack gets her chat on with Arsenal’s Lia Wälti to talk Big Cup action against Wolfsburg and the symbolism of playing home games at the Emirates. Felix Magath, formerly of Fulham, was confined to his hotel room with Covid before his first game as manager of Hertha Berlin, so Mark Fotheringham, a German-speaking Scot, led them to victory over Champions League-chasing Hoffenheim.

3/22/2022,"Boris Becker dishonestly “played” the bankruptcy system, hiding cash, property and trophies from authorities, a court has heard at the opening of his trial. The multiple grand slam winner is charged with 24 counts relating to concealing assets, nine of which relate to trophies and medals won during his illustrious playing career, including from his first Wimbledon men’s single championship when he burst on to the world scene, aged just 17 years old. Becker denies all the charges. Opening the prosecution case at Southwark crown court, in central London, on Monday, Rebecca Chalkley told the members of the jury that while the matters at hand may have caused their hearts to sink, they “boil down to everyday issues of dishonesty and knowledge. That is what we say is at the heart of this case”. She said that the former tennis champion had broken the “bankruptcy bargain” whereby bankrupts are protected from their creditors in return for fully disclosing their assets. “There is a consistent policy throughout the history of bankruptcy legislation, which goes back hundreds of years, that bankrupts who play the system, act in bad faith, should be punished and that, in short is what the prosecution say Mr Becker did here,” she said. She continued: “It’s the prosecution case … that Mr Becker acted dishonestly with regard to a number of his assets.” Becker, 54, is accused of hiding properties in Germany and England, shares and more than €2.07m (£1.7m), including €1.14m from the sale of a car dealership. As well as the 1985 All England Club trophy, which made Becker the youngest Wimbledon men’s singles champion, he is accused of concealing the President’s Cup from 1985 and 1989, a 1988 Davis Cup gold coin and 1989 Davis Cup trophy, the 1989 Wimbledon trophy, 1991 and 1996 Australian Open trophies and a 1992 Olympic gold medal. The court heard that Becker was declared bankrupt in June 2017 on application by the bank Arbuthnot Latham after he failed to repay a €3.5m loan made to him for a property in Mallorca, Spain. The charges relate to the period between May and October 2017. Chalkely said the allegations relate to Becker’s actions before bankruptcy, in a period when he was “essentially on notice” about the likelihood of bankruptcy, with a team of lawyers and advisers on hand to help him, including challenging the bankruptcy, as well as after it. Becker has lived in the UK since 2012 and is a regular commentator for the BBC at Wimbledon. Wearing a navy blue suit and white shirt, he was accompanied in the dock by a translator. Judge Deborah Taylor told the jury that Becker speaks English but may need help with “technical vocabulary such as legal concepts”. The judge also told the jury: “You must ignore this defendant’s celebrity and treat him in exactly the same way you would treat someone you have not heard of and is not in the public eye.” The trial is expected to last three weeks.",News/UK news,"Boris Becker ‘played’ bankruptcy system, jury hears",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/21/boris-becker-played-bankruptcy-system-jury-hears
3/22/2022,"Ministers have delayed by a year publication of a report that will show whether they have achi sugar content of a wide range of foodstuffs by 20%. The official assessment of the government’s high-profile drive to cut the amount of sugar in Britain’s diet was originally due to be published last autumn. However, it was initially put off until early this year and has now been held back again and will not appear until this autumn. Anti-obesity campaigners believe publication is being delayed because ministers are embarrassed that food producers and retailers have ignored their demands to cut sugar levels by a fifth. They say problems such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and tooth decay will continue to worsen unless the government is open about how much sugar was removed from foodstuffs by the deadline of 2020 as a result of its exhortations to the food industry to make products healthier. A paper that the government’s Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) discussed at its most recent meeting, on 11 March, disclosed that the report was now not going to emerge until “autumn 2022”. Barbara Crowther, of the Children’s Food Campaign, an alliance of health and children’s organisations, said the year-long delay was “frustrating and quite frankly unacceptable”. She said: “We understand this report has been ready for some time, so now urge the government to publish this information immediately. We fully expect it will comprehensively reveal the leaders and the laggards, and the need to hold some sectors of the food and drink industry to much more robust account.” Campaigners for healthier food are also concerned that the government appears to be backtracking on its repeated pledge that if food producers do not voluntarily strip out significant amounts of sugar, it will force them to do so. It made that threat when it first told the food industry to cut sugar levels by 20% by 2020 in its 2016 childhood obesity plan. For example, that plan said that if updates on the sugar reduction programme showed that progress was too slow, ministers would look at “whether alternative levers need to be used by the government to reduce sugar and calories in food and drink consumed by children. If there has not been sufficient progress by 2020, we will use other levers to achieve the same aims.” In October 2020 Public Health England (PHE) published the most recent of three progress reports so far. It found that supermarkets, cafes and restaurants had reduced the sugar content of their products by only 3%. While the amount of sugar in breakfast cereals, yoghurts and fromage frais had fallen by 13%, sugar content had risen by 2% in puddings and remained unchanged in chocolate and confectionery. The campaign group Action on Sugar said the findings showed that the government’s strategy of relying on food businesses to voluntarily remove the required 20% was “simply not working”. Ministers and government policy documents have reiterated the threat to use compulsion to achieve the 20% target many times since it was first set. For example, in 2020 Boris Johnson’s administration said the government was “committed to further action if progress is not made”. Legislation or an extension of the highly successful sugar tax on soft drinks were floated. However, the health minister Maggie Throup signalled an apparent U-turn when she disclosed in a parliamentary answer in January that “there are no current plans to introduce further measures”. Mhairi Brown, a nutritionist who is Action on Sugar’s policy and public affairs manager, said she could not understand why the final progress report had not been published. “I can’t help but feel that their threat of legislation was an empty one. Now it’s time for them to announce further measures and they don’t want to commit to it,” Brown said. “So much of our everyday food and drinks comes packed with sugar, put there by the food industry. The food industry needs to gradually take it out and the government needs to lay out a framework to guide that work, monitor that work and hold companies to account if they don’t comply.” The Department of Health and Social Care declined to comment on the latest delay. DHSC sources said the report “is expected to be published in the first half of this year”.",News/Society,Verdict on drive to cut sugar in UK diets now expected a year late,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/21/verdict-on-drive-to-cut-sugar-in-uk-diets-now-expected-a-year-late
3/22/2022,"It was late 2012, early days for Northlane, and the second time we went to New Zealand. We had a string of shows around the North Island, and 1st December was our final show, at Zeal in Wellington. Since we had an eight- or nine-hour drive to the airport the next morning and a really early flight, we decided to give up our headline slot and open the show. So the whole lineup was flipped on its head, pretty much, and there were only around 30 people there in the audience when we went on. So it was comical to begin with. We were booked to headline, and then we asked to open, and the booking agent was like, “Oh … OK.” It was all a bit of an anticlimax. That was, before I fell off the stage. There was a stage with quite a large drum riser on the back of it, with a two-metre drop to the ground, and behind the stage was about a metre gap to the back wall of the venue. About halfway through the set I’m thrashing away, none the wiser, and one of the legs of my drum throne slipped off the back of the riser. The throne has three legs on it, one of them was facing backwards, and they have a little rubber foot on each leg. I felt the rubber foot slip off, and at that point I was like, oh boy. As soon as I felt the drop of the foot, there was absolutely nothing I could do. I couldn’t grab on to the drums, there was nothing that would have stopped me, there was a gravitational pull, and I got sucked down into the space behind the stage. It all happened so quickly. I just kind of remember feeling like I’d been folded in half. I had my in-ear monitors plugged into this rack unit, and that got pulled down on top of me as well. The rest of the band turned around, because suddenly I wasn’t playing any more; I was nowhere to be seen. I was folded behind this stage with an in-ear rack about the size of a bedside table on top of me. They helped get the gear off me. Everyone in the venue was laughing. I hobbled back onstage and we started the song all over again. I had big scratches down my back from sliding down the back wall, but other than that I was fine. I honestly think the back wall saved me, because if I hadn’t hit that first I probably would have hit my head on the ground, and then I wouldn’t have been laughing along with everyone else. But all I had was cuts and bruises. It was one of those comical scenarios, but it could have been worse. I’m glad I survived to tell the tale. Northlane are touring Australia now.

3/22/2022,"A Labor government would present a second “proper” budget in 2022 if elected to correct the “decade of rorts and waste” they expect to be bookended by treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s budget next week. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will tell the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Tuesday an Albanese government would release its own budget by the time of the traditional mid-year fiscal update in December, if not sooner. “We’d take advice on the best specific timing, and confer with Treasury on the possibilities, with an eye to bringing down a proper budget before the end of 2022,” Chalmers will say, according to a copy of his speech. “We’d have a chance to look at the full extent of nearly a decade of rorts and waste and start dealing with it.” Frydenberg used the same forum a week ago to outline the Morrison government’s shift in its fiscal strategy away from supporting the economy to get through Covid to one that plots a shrinking budget deficit as a proportion of overall activity. Economists predict Australia’s falling jobless rate and booming commodity prices, fanned of late by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, will cut the current fiscal year’s budget deficit by as much as $30bn, but still leave more than a decade of deficits ahead. Chalmers is expected to say that no single budget could possibly “undo all of the damage of the last 10 years, not even the last two”. David Richardson, a senior research fellow at the Australia Institute and a former parliamentary researcher, said there was no recent case of a change of government prompting a new budget. Bob Hawke’s election in March 1983, which was followed by a national economic summit a month later, offered the closest comparison. A second budget in 2022 could allow an Albanese government to “make a big bold splash”. “It’s a big chance for them to say what they’d do differently,” Richardson said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Given the major parties already prepare comprehensive pre-election statements, a follow-up budget – particularly after a new government gets a close look at the Treasury’s books – may be the logical next step, he said. Chalmers’ comments foreshadow elements of what may be Labor’s formal response to the 29 March budget. An incoming Albanese government would set five tests for Frydenberg’s budget and how it would frame its own, the shadow treasurer will say. These include whether the budget “rebuilds communities impacted by flood and fire fast enough”, and whether it eases “costs of living pressures enough, responsibly enough”. The Morrison government has flagged a “targeted” cost of living package will be in the budget, while Frydenberg has said the clean-up from the floods in Queensland and NSW will be a central focus. Chalmers will say the third Labor test would be whether the budget supported the recovery and “makes supply chains, businesses, vulnerable communities, public health, and family budgets more secure and resilient”. A fourth would be whether productivity can be boosted to lift “the speed limit on the economy” to enable quicker growth without stoking inflation. The final test would be “whether it ends the rorts and waste, and sets out a clearer path to budget repair”. Any budget, though, would also likely have to contend with rising interest rates since they won’t remain near zero, “no matter who wins office”. An increase in interest rates by one percentage point – as major banks expect over the next year – would result in homeowner-occupiers paying $13bn more in interest annually. Higher rates, though, would also “punch holes in the national budget”, Chalmers will say. Since the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook last December, interest yields on some commonwealth debt had doubled and two-, three-, five- and 10-year bond yields have increased by more than 70 basis points. “In 2024-25 we could be paying $4.7bn more in interest, taking our interest bill to much more than we spend on family tax benefits, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and more than double what the commonwealth spends on government schools or childcare support,” Chalmers said. Separately, a report by the Australia Institute has found the $15.7bn a year Stage 3 tax cuts proposed by the Morrison government and supported by Labor would give those with annual earnings of more than $200,000 a windfall of $9,075. Beneficiaries of the tax cuts, which Labor supports, include bank chief executive, surgeons, and even federal politicians, according to the institute’s Fair Go Gone report. It also found low-income workers on less than $45,000 a year, including aged care workers, disability carers and minimum wage employees, would get nothing. “By cutting taxes for the higher-come earners, this extreme plan will make our tax system permanently less fair,” Richard Denniss, the institute’s chief economist said. “It’s an attack on Australia’s fair-go, progressive tax system.” Should the government also use next week’s budget to end the low-and-middle-income tax offset (Lmito), middle-income earners such as teachers, nurses and midwives would pay $1,080 more in tax, the report said.",News/Australia news,"Labor government would present second 2022 budget to correct ‘decade of rorts and waste’, shadow treasurer says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/labor-government-would-present-second-2022-budget-to-correct-decade-of-rorts-and-waste-shadow-treasurer-says
3/22/2022,"Through a snorkel mask, the corals struggling for survival in the heat are easy to spot. Some have turned white while others are pouring out a fluorescent pigment into their flesh – it’s spectacular, but it’s also a sign of a coral in deep distress. This is John Brewer Reef about 70km off Townsville in Queensland – the centre of a widespread coral bleaching event. For hundreds of kilometres in either direction, reefs are going through the same battle. As we float over one of about 3,000 individual reefs that make up the vast Great Barrier Reef on Sunday afternoon, two scientists are touching down in Brisbane for a 10-day United Nations monitoring mission. Just to the south, there’s another mission. Scientists are in the air, surveying the bleaching from above in a series of government-chartered flights that, by the middle of this week, will have traversed the entire length of the 2,300-km reef. As the Guardian enters the water, the first thing Dr Adam Smith does is glance at his dive watch. It tells him the water is 29C. That is warm. Staghorn corals clinging to the reef edge come into view and almost all are partly or entirely white. Thousands of colourful reef fish, some graceful sharks, and lots of still-healthy corals share the space with the strugglers. Soft corals nestled in the gaps on the top of the reef are white. Other corals shaped like giant dinner plates are coping better – but about half are giving off a spectacular but worrying fluorescent show of pinks and blues. “The coral is basically starving,” says Smith, the managing director of consultancy firm Reef Ecologic. “We’ve definitely just seen corals that are stressed and white. “This is one of the healthiest reefs off Townsville and one of the best reefs on the whole Great Barrier Reef. So for these corals to be stressed and damaged … well, it’s likely it’s the same at other reefs down here.” The UN mission to the reef will examine the state and federal government’s response to managing the reef and their policies. Last year, the world heritage committee ignored the scientific advice from Unesco that it should be placed on the “in danger” list because of the impact of global heating and slow progress on combating pollution running into the reef. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Coral bleaching across thousands of kilometres of the world’s biggest reef system is just one of Australia’s battles with the climate emergency. Bushfires, flooding, shifting rainfall, heatwaves and extreme weather are all being super-charged by rising greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere. The reef’s marine park authority is waiting until its aerial surveys are completed before it can compare this bleaching to other events in 1998, 2002, 2016, 2017 and 2020. But this is the first time there has been widespread bleaching during a La Niña weather pattern – the phase of a cycle of shifting warm areas in the Pacific Ocean that delivers more cloud and rain, and cooler conditions, over the reef. Scientists had hoped a La Niña would be a chance for the corals to grow and spawn and multiply. A respite from its struggles with climate change. But no. “This is the first time we’ve seen mass bleaching in a La Niña. That’s because of global warming,” says Prof Terry Hughes, a leading coral scientist at Townsville’s James Cook University. Hughes and others who reviewed the Guardian’s images from John Brewer said there’s a chance many corals could survive if water temperatures drop – and there are signs they will. “That’s a moderately bleached reef,” says Hughes, after seeing drone pictures. Early signs from the aerial flights suggest in this central region John Brewer may have faired better than other reefs. But Hughes warns there’s a “physiological cost even if the coral lives”. Being heat-stressed and producing fluorescent pigments or losing their colour entirely weakens the corals, making them more susceptible to disease, slowing their growth and affecting their ability to reproduce. There is genuine dread among scientists at what could be in store for the reef when the next warm phase – known as El Niño – hits. That could happen within the next couple of years. “It’s depressing to think about,” says Hughes. On the boat on Sunday afternoon, Paul Crocombe, the owner of Adrenalin Snorkel and Dive, tried to navigate the complex story of bleaching and reef health in a briefing to the passengers. He’s seen this reef bleach before and he’s seeing it today. “There’s plenty of evidence of bleaching here. That’s severe for [those corals], but there’s lots of corals that have still got plenty of colour. “The reef is really resilient. It will come back. But it will be hard for it to keep up if they [bleaching events] come along too often. The 2016 event there was big areas of white [at John Brewer]. This is serious, but it’s not severe. “These last two weeks we have seen an increase in the amount of bleaching. It’s always a concern. “But how many times have you heard that the reef will be dead in 20 or 30 years. That’s just not true. “Yes it will change and what we’ve seen today could be quite different to what you’ll see in 30 years, but there will be a reef and there will be corals. We get asked if there’s anything still worth seeing. There is so much misinformation.” Crocombe’s business doesn’t need more bad news. He says he has reached the limit of his borrowing after visitor numbers crashed through the pandemic. Crocombe says there needs to be rapid action to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and thinks all pollution – that which comes from agriculture during floods and what humans pump into the air from burning fossil fuels – should be taxed. Jeremy Gacel, 31, was among the divers on John Brewer. He’s been travelling the world for nearly five years, diving in Central America and Australia’s west coast. This was his first dive on the Great Barrier Reef. Smaller fish are usually hard to see in the dark staghorn corals, but as they turn white they’re easier to see. “It was full of life and lots of fish. The bleaching is a bit disappointing – it’s sad for me because I love diving. It’s not supposed to be white.” Does he know what’s causing the bleaching? “Humans,” he says. “It’s not just the ocean. I’m an ice climber and I’ve seen the ice disappearing. The water is getting warmer and warmer and reefs are super fragile. I know.”",News/Environment,‘It’s not supposed to be white’: one of the Great Barrier Reef’s healthiest reefs succumbs to bleaching,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/its-not-supposed-to-be-white-one-of-the-great-barrier-reefs-healthiest-reefs-succumbs-to-bleaching
3/22/2022,"Voters are underwhelmed by the Morrison government’s response to recent catastrophic flooding in New South Wales and Queensland, and a majority fear disasters will be worse in the absence of significant action to address climate risks, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey of 1,091 voters finds only 26% of respondents characterised the Coalition’s recent flood disaster response as good, while 40% thought poor and 34% said neither good nor poor. The new data points to community disappointment but the public backlash after the flood disaster is less visceral than after the catastrophic summer bushfires of 2019-20. Back then, in January 2020, 57% of Guardian Essential respondents disapproved of Morrison’s response while 32% approved. In the latest poll, a majority of respondents think the government needs to prepare for extreme weather events (65%). A majority also thinks if there isn’t significant action on climate crisis policy soon, floods will be worse in the future (57% agreement). A majority also believes the government needs to replace coal with renewable energy alternatives (53%). But only 45% of respondents say the Morrison government contributed to the floods by not taking enough action to mitigate the risks of global heating. Voters were more concerned about a lack of climate action in January 2020. Back then, 65% of respondents thought bushfires would be worse if there wasn’t substantial climate action soon and 60% of respondents pointed the finger directly at the Coalition for not doing enough. The Morrison government and the Perrottet government in NSW were criticised in the immediate aftermath of the floods for moving too slowly with rescue and recovery efforts. The federal government confirmed on Friday it would dip into its Emergency Response Fund to pay for flood mitigation measures in NSW and Queensland after months of escalating criticism from Labor about the Coalition’s decision not to draw from the $4bn pool. Federal parliament will resume next week for a short session to allow the government to deliver the budget on 29 March. Morrison is expected to call the election within weeks. At the weekend, the Liberals in South Australia became the first incumbent government to lose an election since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the federal contest in sight, both the prime minister and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, are in full campaign mode. The latest Guardian Essential data suggests the gap is closing between Morrison and Albanese in the poll’s preferred prime minister metric. Morrison is currently the preferred prime minister for 39% of respondents (down from 42% a fortnight ago) and Albanese by 36% (up from 34%). One-quarter of respondents aren’t sure which candidate they prefer. Comparing the result with previous election cycles, just before the 2010 election, Julia Gillard was ahead of Tony Abbott 47% to 35% with 18% undecided. In 2013, Abbott was ahead of Kevin Rudd 41% to 22% with 37% undecided. In 2016, Malcolm Turnbull was ahead of Bill Shorten 39% to 31% with 30% undecided while in 2019 Morrison was ahead of Shorten 39% to 32% with 28% undecided. Albanese is currently ahead of where Abbott, Rudd and Shorten were at the same point in the political cycle on this measure. Voting intention figures, calculated by Guardian Essential, now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus”, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. A fortnight ago, Labor’s primary vote was on 35%, the Coalition on 36% and the Greens on 10%. The two-party preferred “plus” result had Labor on 49%, the Coalition on 44% and 7% of respondents undecided. In the latest poll, Labor’s primary vote is 37% (up from 35%), Coalition: 37% (up from 36%), with 7% of respondents undecided. On the two-party preferred “plus” measure Labor is on 48% (down from 49%), the Coalition: 44% (steady), with 7% of respondents undecided. While Morrison was buffeted in the past fortnight by public criticism of the Coalition’s flood response, Albanese has been trying to fend off internal backbiting about party culture that erupted after the sudden death of the Victorian right-wing senator Kimberley Kitching at the age of 52. Despite their recent challenges, in this fortnight’s data, both leaders are up slightly on the poll’s approval metric, with 45% of respondents (up from 44%) currently approving of Morrison’s performance, 48% disapproving (down from 49%), with 7% of voters unsure. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning When it comes to Albanese, 43% of respondents approve of the opposition leader’s performance (up from 42%), while 36% disapprove (down from 39%). While only 7% of respondents don’t have a clear opinion about Morrison, the number of voters on the fence about Albanese remains significantly higher at 20% of respondents. All of these movements are inside the poll’s margin of error, which is plus or minus three points. On Tuesday, the Australian National University will also release the latest data on voting intention from a longitudinal survey of 3,472 voters. It finds that the Coalition’s primary vote has slumped to 32.2% – a “dramatic drop” from 40.3% in January 2021 and 35.4% in January 2020. The lead author of the Centre for Social Research and Methods study, Prof Nicholas Biddle, said support for the Morrison government was “significantly lower than the 37% who said they would vote for Labor, who would appear to have been in an election-winning position”. The proportion of undecided voters increased from 4.1% in January 2021 to 5.9% in January 2022, it found. According to the survey, women have a “relative preference for Labor and the Greens compared with males” who were “also far more likely not know who they would vote for”. The study did not estimate the two-party preferred vote “due to lack of information in our survey on preference flows” but noted the result of primaries was consistent with public polling.",News/Australia news,Guardian Essential poll: voters mark Morrison government down on flood response,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/guardian-essential-poll-voters-mark-morrison-government-down-on-flood-response
3/22/2022,"As football fans wend their way to Stamford Bridge for Chelsea’s home game against Brentford next month, not all will realise they are walking past dozens of apartments belonging to one of Britain’s most valuable private property portfolios. The sanctioned club owner, Roman Abramovich, and his family have amassed a UK property collection worth more than £250m, numbering about 70 homes, buildings and pieces of land. The list of assets connected to the oligarch has been compiled by the Russian asset tracker, a partnership involving the Guardian, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Süddeutsche Zeitung and other international news organisations that are reporting on the wealth of Russia’s most powerful operators. It is a snapshot in time, based on information dating from 2020 to the present. The Guardian, working alongside the campaign group Transparency International, has also seen evidence connecting the billionaire’s companies and relatives to 53 luxury residential properties – plus commercial buildings and plots of land – in central London. Alongside the oligarch’s widely reported 15-bedroom mansion in Kensington Palace Gardens, bought for £120m, the Abramovich collection includes 42 flats and apartments in Chelsea Village, the hotel and residential complex situated around the football ground, including a $5.5m penthouse apartment overlooking the stadium and a $1m penthouse in the hotel. Properties owned by the wider Abramovich family include two luxury addresses next door to each other in a square in Belgravia, where the adjacent homes are adorned by neat privet hedges and a flower-filled first-floor balcony. Less than three miles down the road, near Kensington Palace, the family added to their luxury collection last year with a £17.5m townhouse. Other connected assets include the use of two jets – a £39m Gulfstream and a $10.4m Bombardier – plus a pair of Airbus helicopters, struck off the Isle of Man registry the day after sanctions were imposed on Abramovich by the UK. There are two yachts linked to Abramovich: the 458ft Solaris and the 533ft Eclipse. Confirmation is also being sought for the ownership of two more private jets. There are also trust funds connected with Abramovich and his family, including two in Cyprus: the first, HF Trust, valued at $900m, according to 2016 data contained in the banking leak known as the FinCEN files. A second entity, the Sara Trust Settlement, was involved in transactions totalling $304m, also in 2016. The compilation of the list of assets linked to Abramovich comes as governments have warned how opaque ownership structures could frustrate efforts to implement sanctions. Abramovich was sanctioned by the UK government at the beginning of March after ministers accused him of having “clear connections” to Vladimir Putin’s regime and being among a group of businesspeople with “blood on their hands”. The oligarch has previously vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Putin and Russia, or that he has done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him. The most visible effect of the UK move has been to plunge the Russian tycoon’s football team into crisis, with the business restricted from making further ticket sales. The club is up for sale, with bids of more than £2bn submitted by interested parties last weekend. The proceeds are expected to be either donated to charity or held in a restricted account. Among other well-known assets held by the oligarch is a 29% stake in the London-listed steel and mining group Evraz, which was worth £2.5bn at the end of 2021. However, the shares then plummeted, with Abramovich’s stake worth about £338m as the crisis in Ukraine unravelled. The 10-member board of directors of Evraz resigned this month after sanctions were imposed on the Russian oligarch and shares in the company were suspended. Abramovich did not respond to numerous efforts by the Guardian to contact him.",News/World news,Inside the £250m Abramovich property portfolio,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/roman-abramovich-uk-property-portfolio-chelsea-fc-owner-sanctioned
3/22/2022,"Space must not become “a new realm for conflict”, Peter Dutton will say as he launches the Australian defence force’s new space command. The defence minister will on Tuesday accuse some countries – including Russia – of seeing “space as a territory for their taking”. Dutton will tell a conference in Canberra that Australia will work with allies to push for “a safe, stable and secure space domain”. In a second speech on Tuesday, Dutton will say Australia is “in the crosshairs” for cyber-attacks, while declaring that authorities believe China has the capability to mount “an unprecedented digital onslaught”. Both speeches reflect the Coalition’s determination to promote a tough message on national security before the election due in May – despite both parties having a largely similar approach to the major strategic challenges. Dutton will on Tuesday “officially announce” that Australia’s Defence space command has now been established, bringing together personnel from the air force, the navy and the army – as the government foreshadowed last year. In an advance copy of the speech, he says the command – headed by air vice-marshal Cath Roberts – “will initially be modest compared to those similar, well-established functions which already exist among some of our allies”. Addressing an air force-organised conference, Dutton will raise the possibility of Australia establishing a US-style space force in future. “It’s a necessary endeavour with a view to protecting our national interests and our need for a space force in the future,” Dutton will say, according to speech extracts distributed by his office to the media. Dutton is expected to say that space “is becoming more congested and is already contested – particularly as the boundaries between competition and conflict become increasingly blurred through grey-zone activities”. He will note more than 7,500 satellites orbit the Earth and thousands are being launched each year. “We know that some countries are developing capabilities to threaten or degrade space networks, to target satellites, and to destroy space systems – countries that see space as a territory for their taking, rather than one to be shared,” he will say. Dutton will cite an anti-satellite missile test in November last year when Russia “destroyed its own redundant Cosmos 1408, which left behind a cloud of more than 1,500 pieces of lethal debris that will take decades to clear”. At the time, the head of Nasa described the test as “unconscionable” and a threat to the safety of seven astronauts – including two Russians – onboard the International Space Station. The Russian military defended the test, insisting it was aimed at boosting the country’s defensive capabilities and denying the fragments were dangerous. Dutton will tell Tuesday’s conference that Australia will “invest in new military space capabilities to counter threats, to assure our continued access to space-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and to uphold the free use of space”. “The Australian Department of Defence and the US National Reconnaissance Office have committed to a broad range of cooperative satellite activities which will expand Australia’s space knowledge and capabilities,” he will say. The NRO is a key US intelligence agency that gathers information through satellites and has a presence in the sometimes-controversial Pine Gap facility in the Northern Territory. Australia and India are also set to develop their space ties, after the prime minister, Scott Morrison, met with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, on Monday night. The government announced a $25m plan to deepen the Australian Space Agency’s cooperation with India. The two countries will also establish an exchange program for young officers in the two countries’ defence forces and will expand research on critical minerals – but a long-awaited trade deal is yet to be completed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Morrison and Modi discussed the conflict in Ukraine. India has called for an end to hostilities but so far declined to explicitly condemn Russia, with which it has longstanding ties. At the outset of the virtual summit, Morrison said the “tragic loss of life underlines the importance, of course, of holding Russia to account” and also showed the need to improve cooperation between like-minded democracies. Dutton will tell Tuesday’s event the RAAF has now delivered Australian military assistance for Ukraine on three separate Globemaster flights and will describe Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, as “a despot hellbent on reinstating Russia’s imperial reach”. Dutton has previously faced accusations of politicising national security, including through his prediction last November that Australia would probably join with the US to defend the democratically governed island of Taiwan in a future conflict with China. At the time, Labor’s Senate leader, Penny Wong, said “amping up the prospect of war” was “the most dangerous election tactic in Australian history – a tactic employed by irresponsible politicians who are desperate to hang on to power at any cost”. But Dutton will say on Tuesday that Australians “expect their governments to speak frankly about the challenges which confront our nation” rather than “ring-fence them from difficult issues or insult their intelligence”. Opening a new facility for the Australian Signals Directorate in Canberra, Dutton will say cyberwarfare “is unbound and unchecked, without clear and well-known cues of escalation”. Dutton will say Beijing’s expansion of its hard power “has been matched by the growth of its cyber forces, to a point where our authorities assess that China is now capable of mounting an unprecedented digital onslaught”. “Spying is at one end of a spectrum of cyber activities. At the other end are cyber-attacks of such scale and sophistication they can be nationally, regionally, and globally debilitating. Australia has fortunately not experienced such an attack. But make no mistake, we are in the crosshairs.” Last July, the Morrison government joined with the US, the UK and other countries to accuse China of malicious cyber activities, prompting the Chinese embassy in Australia to denounce the claims as “groundless” and “extremely hypocritical”. Labor has said Australia needs to boost its cyber defences, noting recent reports from the Australian National Audit Office about weaknesses in preparedness within government agencies.",News/Australia news,Peter Dutton says space command needed as some countries ‘see space as a territory for their taking’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/peter-dutton-says-space-command-needed-as-some-countries-see-space-as-a-territory-for-their-taking
3/22/2022,"Health experts are weighing up whether a second booster rollout will soon be needed as Covid-19 cases again surge across Australia and winter approaches. A number of nations, including the UK, are rapidly expanding eligibility for a fourth dose, but some experts have questioned its effectiveness. How likely is it a fourth dose will be required? The government has yet to commit to a second booster rollout. However, it is expected older Australians will be the first to be eligible when it does begin. Earlier in March the federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said advice from Australia’s vaccine advisory group was due by the end of the month on whether a fourth dose would be recommended for people aged 65 and over. Hunt said it was more likely than not a fourth dose would be needed for some groups of the population ahead of winter, when a spike in both Covid and flu infections is forecast. “I can’t pre-empt the decision but … they are potentially going to recommend a second booster, which would be potentially the start of an annual program for people 65 and above,” Hunt said. “We’re expecting that advice from Atagi within the next three weeks, if not earlier.” Who is already eligible for a fourth dose? A limited number of people are eligible already. A fourth vaccination dose is recommended for severely immunocompromised people aged over 16, who produce a lower immune response than the equivalent number of doses in healthy people. Earlier this year, adults with weakened immune systems, including cancer patients, became eligible to receive a fourth vaccination after Atagi guidelines changed due to the Omicron outbreak. Last month, the booster program was further expanded to severely immunocompromised adolescents aged 16 and 17. A fourth dose can be administered three months after the completion of an immunocompromised person’s primary course – currently three doses. Cancer Australia CEO, professor Dorothy Keefe, said immunocompromised people could have a prolonged Covid infection which increased the risk of viral variants developing. “As people who are severely immunocompromised may have a suboptimal response or non-response to the standard two-dose primary vaccine schedule, Atagi recommends … a fourth dose … to increase their protection,” she said. What countries are administering fourth doses? Until recently, a number of countries including the US, Chile, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the UK were similarly limiting second boosters to the immunocompromised. But this week, England expands its eligibility to about five million people including care home residents, people over 75 and immunocompromised people aged over 12. It follows a resurgence of Covid cases across the UK, with infections in the over-70s at a record high. Similarly in Asia, South Korea is recommending a fourth dose for nursing home and care residents and workers as well as the immunocompromised in light of rising infections among elderly people. Israel was the first country to administer a fourth dose more widely. It began to roll out third doses in July, and since January, anyone who is a health worker, immunocompromised, or over 60 has been eligible for a fourth vaccine. Israeli health experts have since suggested a fourth dose for all adults. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech requested emergency authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration for a fourth dose among the over 65s, citing Israeli datasets which showed an additional mRNA booster lowered infections and severe illness. How effective would a fourth dose be in Australia? There’s mixed evidence on the effectiveness of a second booster, however the risk calculation is evolving as new Covid variants emerge. Deakin University chair of epidemiology, Prof Catherine Bennett, said it was still too early to tell what cover the third dose provided and whether vaccinating with a fourth dose would change health outcomes. But she said Australia had the benefit of being one season behind and being able to monitor what was occurring in the rest of the world. “What we don’t yet know is if Covid will ever become a winter bug,” she said. “Omicron reached us in the peak of summer, if we reach a period where we don’t see new variants and none end up being infectious enough to replace what we have, it might slope back into something more seasonal.” The Omicron sub-variant BA.2 is on the rise in Australia, and is expected to become the dominant strain of Covid-19 in the coming months. It is highly likely BA.2, which shares similar mutations to Omicron, will be similarly resistant to a third dose. Nevertheless, Australian regulators require strong data before approving additional doses. After its latest meeting on 11 March, Atagi said it was “continuing to monitor and discuss” emerging evidence on subsequent booster doses “particularly coming into the winter months”. An Israeli trial released in February suggested receiving a fourth vaccine raised antibody levels, but provided little extra protection against Covid-19 in addition to a third dose. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning New research published in the New England Journal of Medicine this month, though, shows immunity from a third jab wanes quickly – dropping to about 45% with the Omicron strain ten weeks after a third Pfizer dose despite its initial protection from severe illness. Bennett said no matter what Atagi decided, immunity was likely to be different for younger versus older and immunocompromised adults. “We don’t treat everyone as one, if it’s good enough from the booster there’s no point in giving another dose … and there’s a risk it might desensitise you to the virus,” she said. Why are third doses still lagging? The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP) president, Dr Karen Price, said it was a “matter for the government” as to whether a fourth dose should be rolled out to the general population. But there were “several reasons” why booster rates remained sluggish. As of 13 March, only 65.6% of eligible people had received a third vaccine dose, while in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, just 49.4% had the jab. “Some patients are uncertain about when to get their booster dose after contracting the virus and others are potentially complacent because of widespread media reports about the Omicron variant being less severe,” Price said. “It’s not just about protecting yourself, it’s also about protecting the broader community including people more vulnerable to severe effects from the virus.” What about the flu jab? The seasonal flu all but disappeared in 2020 and 2021 due to public health measures, however Atagi expects a resurgence of the virus outside the usual influenza season as international borders reopen and with Covid restrictions eased. There wasn’t a single influenza death in 2021, while case numbers were at 3% of those recorded in 2020 – which was already eight times lower than the five-year average of 163,015 cases. Atagi said lower vaccine coverage in 2021 and virus circulation meant many children under five hadn’t been exposed to the virus or developed immunity, thereby increasing the risk of complications. Atagi has recommended those planning an international trip receive the influenza vaccine before they fly, and get vaccinated as soon as this year’s jab becomes available. Bennett said this year the population didn’t have the “natural boost” that came from having relatively high levels of the flu. “But the flu hasn’t taken off overseas in ways we might have thought it would – there’s some hope it won’t be devastating but we need to be careful,” she said. As Covid and the flu are different viruses – it’s possible to have both at the same time, ominously dubbed ‘flurona’. Bennett said while this was a concern – it wouldn’t necessarily become common. “The viruses may be competing with each other,” she said. “But we should be very careful about both because … the world’s shifted which makes it more challenging to predict.”",News/World news,With Covid cases surging across Australia will a fourth vaccine dose be required?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/with-covid-cases-surging-across-australia-will-a-fourth-vaccine-dose-be-required
3/22/2022,"More than $17bn (£13bn) of global assets – including offshore bank accounts, yachts, private jets and luxury properties in London, Tuscany and the French Riviera – have been linked to 35 oligarchs and Russian officials alleged to have close ties to Vladimir Putin. Today, the Guardian, working in a partnership with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project , Süddeutsche Zeitung and other international news organisations, is unveiling the initial research in an ongoing project to track the wealth of Russia’s most powerful operators. The Russian asset tracker project will start by focusing on a list of 35 men and women named last year as Putin’s alleged enablers by the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny. It will record assets outside Russia where the reporting partners have seen evidence connecting them to these individuals. Navalny’s organisation wrote to western governments requesting the names on its list be considered for sanctions and all but two have since been blacklisted by either the US, EU, UK or Canada. The names include four of the wealthiest oligarchs, plus heads of state-controlled companies, prominent broadcasters, spy agency chiefs, ministers, political advisers and regional governors. They have been read out in the US Congress by lawmakers seeking tougher penalties for the Russian elite and in the UK parliament by the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, Layla Moran. Moran told the Commons: “Putin’s cronies must be subject to the strongest possible sanctions now, because it is through them that Putin and his inner circle keep their wealth. If we go after his associates, we go after him. Actually, we are rather uniquely placed to do so, because they choose London. They live here: it is ‘Londongrad’ to them.” . The Russian asset tracker has identified UK properties or plots of land – collectively worth more than half a billion dollars – that are linked through companies, trusts or relatives to four leading figures on Navalny’s list: Roman Abramovich, Alisher Usmanov, Oleg Deripaska and Igor Shuvalov. The Guardian will report on these findings over the coming days. The research so far has seen evidence, most of it dating from 2020 to the present, of the names being connected to more than 145 assets consisting of 35 mansions, 43 apartments and 27 other pieces of real estate. Seven yachts, plus 11 private jets and helicopters, worth a combined $2bn, have been identified as linked to just six individuals. Some of the assets in the tracker are in the public domain – including Deripaska’s Belgrave Square mansion in central London, which was taken over by squatters last week, as well as the Dilbar, Lena and Amore Vero superyachts, linked to the oligarchs Usmanov, Gennady Timchenko and Igor Sechin respectively. Other possessions have gone largely unnoticed, or sometimes existed in almost total secrecy. Last month, the US Treasury highlighted the problems of opaque ownership by stating: “Sanctioned oligarchs and powerful Russian elites have used family members to move assets and to conceal their immense wealth.” Outside the UK, the Russian asset tracker has uncovered: Twenty-six assets apparently connected to Deripaska, who is said to be Putin’s favourite industrialist. They include billions of dollars in shares, a hotel in the Austrian Alps, a superyacht, a 60-metre support vessel with helipad and luxury properties in London, Paris, Washington DC and New York, and four villas in Sardinia. Two private jets – a $65m Gulfstream G650 and a Bombardier Global Express – connected to Shuvalov, Russia’s former first deputy prime minister and now chairman of the state development corporation. Shuvalov is also linked to three luxury properties collectively worth about $35m located in Salzkammergut, Austria, Tuscany in Italy, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Property holding companies linked to the families of Nikolay Tokarev, the chairman of the state-controlled pipeline company Transneft, as well as the presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov. The Tokarev companies appear to own luxury properties on the Croatian island of Lošinj, a known hotspot for rich Russians, while the Peskov firm is connected to an expensive Paris apartment. Many of the less well-known assets are held via shell companies based in offshore secrecy jurisdictions and trust funds, making them harder to track. Others are owned by relatives or associates of those on the Navalny list, raising questions about the source of funds used to acquire those assets. They have been checked using proofs ranging from publicly available sources, data from the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’ offshore leaks databases, the FinCEN files of reports of suspicious banking transactions and human intelligence sources. The tracker serves as a snapshot in time, and includes assets only where reporters have seen documentary evidence or other reliable information linking them to the Navalny 35. Some possessions linked widely to certain oligarchs have yet to be confirmed. Abramovich, Tokarev, Peskov and Shuvalov have yet to respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Deripaska, said: “It is unclear how publishing this kind of ‘asset inventory’ might serve the public interest. Unless, of course, by ‘public interest’ you mean encouraging squatters to occupy private property, like they did with a London house belonging to Mr Deripaska’s relatives. “All of the property and assets that he owns were acquired by fair means. The ongoing media frenzy, regrettable as it is, certainly doesn’t give anyone the right to call Mr Deripaska a kleptocrat. The Russia witch-hunt of which Mr Deripaska has become a victim is driven entirely by political motives.” A spokesperson for Usmanov added: “The entirety of Mr Usmanov’s capital was built through successful, sometimes risky, investments, as well as through the effective management of his assets, which is the essence of business. Therefore, to characterise the source of his money as ‘non-transparent’ is inherently incorrect and damages Mr Usmanov’s reputation as an honest entrepreneur and philanthropist.”",News/World news,$17bn of global assets linked to 35 Russians with alleged ties to Putin,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/global-assets-russians-alleged-ties-putin-wealth-oligarchs-navalny
3/22/2022,"Today, the Guardian and its reporting partners are launching the Russian asset tracker, the most comprehensive audit yet published of wealth held outside Russia linked to some of the country’s all-powerful oligarchs and officials. We have examined the ownership of 145 assets, worth more than $17bn, comprising real estate, yachts, private jets and shares in businesses. The information, which dates from 2020 to the present and serves as a snapshot in time, was assembled in collaboration with the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, Süddeutsche Zeitung and 25 other news outlets. The project was conceived in February, as the armed forces of the Russian Federation were massing near the borders of Ukraine. It begins with a list of 35 individuals named last year by the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny as “key enablers and beneficiaries of the Kremlin’s kleptocracy”. At the time, Navalny was urging tougher sanctions to curb Vladimir Putin’s influence. Three weeks after the invasion, 27 of those individuals are subject to sanctions in the US and Europe. A further seven have been blacklisted in Canada. They are, in the language of the UK sanctions legislation, alleged to be “obtaining a benefit from or supporting the government of Russia”. The Navalny list includes four of the wealthiest oligarchs, plus heads of state-controlled banks and energy companies, prominent broadcasters, spy agency chiefs, ministers, political advisers and regional governors. Over the coming weeks, the Russian asset tracker will expand to cover a wider group of sanctioned individuals. Many have denied they are close to Putin or benefit from his regime. For now, however, their assets are frozen, they cannot be sold or used to generate a profit. There are severe restrictions on these individuals’ ability to travel, spend money and make use of their villas and penthouses. In order to avert an escalation of the war in Ukraine, the UK and other governments are seeking to use financial measures to weaken Russia and punish those who profit from its economy. However, these sanctions will be effective only if they are enforced. The wealth of oligarchs can be difficult to trace. While some investments, such as Chelsea football club, are held in full public view, many are not. Ownership is often obscured by shell companies and trusts, situated in tax havens. That is why our journalists have pieced together data from a number of sources from the last six years, including offshore leaks published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, and reports of suspicious banking transactions contained in the FinCEN files. It is not illegal to hold wealth offshore, and there are legitimate reasons for doing so, such as privacy. However, the data we have examined shows banks have at times raised questions about unexplained wealth or the origin of funds passing through accounts. Our research has extended to relatives and associates, because in some cases their wealth derives almost entirely from the person under sanctions. Including family gives a more complete picture of the scale of the fortune. In other cases, they could be used to hide or disperse assets – with wives holding shares on behalf of husbands, or trusted enablers acting as nominees. The UK has recognised this, by imposing sanctions on some family members. In a statement issued on 26 February by the White House, western allies announced a transatlantic sanctions taskforce with a remit to pursue “officials and elites close to the Russian government, as well as their families, and their enablers to identify and freeze the assets they hold in our jurisdictions”. The City of London has for years been criticised by politicians and campaigners for opening its doors to money of questionable origin in exchange for generous commissions paid to lawyers, auditors, and money managers. To the government’s critics, this may explain why the UK was initially slower than other countries in its response to Ukraine, lagging behind the EU in blacklisting individuals. At a time when ill-prepared and often under-funded law enforcement agencies are scrambling to identify who owns what, helping to expose hidden wealth and those who benefit from it is a vital task. It can prevent dispersal and encourage enforcement of the rules. Since 2016, with the publication of the Panama papers, relentless media reporting has shown the need for greater transparency and regulation in the offshore world. Reform has been slow, and it has often met with political resistance. The difficulty in enforcing the latest sanctions suggests there are still many places to hide.",News/World news,What is the Russian asset tracker and why are we publishing it?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/russian-asset-tracker-publishing-ukraine-war-hidden-wealth-putin
3/22/2022,"Roman Abramovich’s journey from an impoverished, orphaned childhood to Chelsea-owning billionaire was forged in the chaotic transformation of Russia itself, in the years after the iron curtain fell. His elevation into an oligarch is unusually well documented, chronicled in painstaking detail in an English high court judgment of Lady Justice Gloster in 2012, when Abramovich succeeded in defending a lawsuit brought by his former mentor, Boris Berezovsky. In the case, both men described their careers, and routes to becoming billionaires, as “a uniquely Russian story”. Born in 1966, Abramovich lost both his parents by the time he was three, and he was brought up by relatives in the Komi republic, in Russia’s freezing north. After a brief period in the army, he studied as an engineer, and worked first as a mechanic. In Russia’s perestroika period, when economic liberalisation allowed for small businesses, Abramovich ran a children’s toy manufacturer, famously selling plastic ducks from his Moscow apartment. After communism fell, he worked his way up in trading and transportation of oil and other industrial products. The court judgment records that at the time of his first, transformational meeting with Berezovsky, on a Caribbean cruise in December 1994, Abramovich was “a moderately successful businessman”. The creation of the vast state oil concern Sibneft, whose formation and sale to Abramovich made his fortune, was an idea he conceived and suggested to Berezovsky, the court judgment noted. Already rich from his dealings in the automotive sector, and politically connected, Berezovsky was the ideal business partner for Abramovich. Obsessed with opposing any prospect of Russia returning to communism, Berezovsky proposed Abramovich’s idea to the then president, Boris Yeltsin: merging a crude oil producer with a refinery, and handing control of the enlarged business to Abramovich and Berezovsky. In exchange, Berezovsky would use revenues from the new oil company to fund a TV station, ORT, to broadcast pro-Yeltsin propaganda. Yeltsin created Sibneft by decree in August 1995, when Abramovich was still only 29. Then, the judgment records, the new huge oil concern was sold to Abramovich in a series of auctions whose price in some cases is stated to have been rigged, with other bidders discouraged by various means. Abramovich bought 90% of Sibneft for approximately $240m, using only $18.8m of his own capital, although Gloster said it was “possibly more”. The judgment states that it was Abramovich’s own case that he had a deal to pay Berezovsky for political influence, that this deal was “corrupt”, and that Berezovsky’s political lobbying activities were “inherently corrupt”. Abramovich’s barrister, Jonathan Sumption QC, “accepted that Mr Abramovich was privy to that corruption, but submitted that the reality was that that was how business was done in Russia in those times”. The court judgment also noted that Abramovich had “good relations” with Vladimir Putin, Yeltsin’s successor, and unlike Berezovsky and other oligarchs who fell out with the new president, Abramovich continued to flourish. According to the judgment he made another fortune from the acquisition of companies in Russia’s aluminium industry, and in 2003 he sold a 25% stake in the RusAl aluminium company to another oligarch, Oleg Deripaska, for $1.9bn. He sold a further 25% for $540m. Abramovich emerged from this brutal environment, described in the court case as “the wild east”, to global fame and celebrity when he bought Chelsea in 2003. He and his management team, some of whom have remained trusted associates throughout, improved Sibneft and modernised its operations. Then in 2005, Gazprom, the huge fuel company majority-owned by the Russian state, bought his then 72% stake, paying £7.4bn. The billions Abramovich made from Russia’s privatisations funded his famously lavish lifestyle: grand houses, private jets, yachts and fast cars, the £1.5bn he pumped into Chelsea, and a portfolio of further investments. The most public is a 29% stake in Evraz, a London Stock Exchange-listed industrial conglomerate with steel production plants in Russia, the US and Canada, which had revenues of $14bn in 2021. The UK government cited Evraz as a reason for targeting Abramovich with sanctions, along with its assessment that he had “a close relationship for decades” with Putin. Evraz was accused of providing services or goods to the Russian state, “which includes potentially supplying steel to the Russian military which may have been used in the production of tanks”. The company denied that, saying it “supplies long steel to infrastructure and construction sectors only”. The value of Evraz – £12bn in 2021 – has plummeted 86%, and trading in its shares was suspended after sanctions were imposed on Abramovich. The oligarch has previously vehemently disputed reports suggesting his alleged closeness to Putin and Russia, or that he has done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him.",News/World news,From poor orphan to billionaire oligarch: how Abramovich made his money,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/21/roman-abramovich-billionaire-oligarch-money-russia-chelsea
3/22/2022,"The suspension of the iVote online voting system in New South Wales will undermine the rights of blind and low vision Australians and poses an “unacceptable” and “significant” step backwards, Australia’s leading low vision not-for-profit says. The NSW electoral commission announced last week it was suspending the iVote system until 2023 after technical glitches during local government elections last year which prevented voters from casting their ballots, throwing elections in Kempsey, Singleton and the City of Shellharbour into doubt. But the suspension has prompted serious concern among blind and low vision groups, who have called for a suitable alternative to be found. iVote was introduced initially to enable those with blindness or low vision to cast an anonymous, independent and verifiable vote. Without it, they were generally forced to tell family, friends or electoral staff how they wanted to vote, so it could be cast on their behalf. The iVote system is also used for people with a disability who are unable to attend a polling place or those living in remote areas. The Vision Australia lead policy adviser, Bruce Maguire, said the commission had not announced anything to replace the online voting system. Maguire said this represented a “significant step backwards” in voting rights for blind and low vision Australians. “At the moment they’re saying they will provide a human-assisted telephone voting option, which we’re saying is not in any way equivalent to iVote,” he said. “It doesn’t allow you to vote independently, because you have to tell your vote to a third party and it’s certainly not secret. “It’s really not verifiable because you can’t be sure that what you told them is what they’ve written down, even if they say they have two people monitoring things.” In a statement announcing the suspension, the NSW electoral commission said it would work with stakeholder groups for blind and low vision electors to ensure they were able to continue to access the electoral process. “The electoral commission will start work immediately with representatives of the core users of iVote – being electors whose disability or location overseas or in remote areas of NSW makes traditional voting a challenge – to explore other ways to support their participation in the election,” the statement said. The commission did not provide a further response to Vision Australia’s concerns. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Maguire said the NSW government had failed blind and low vision people by not ensuring the system was maintained and fit for purpose. “If iVote is no longer fit for purpose, the NSW government must provide a suitable alternative for the blind and low vision community,” Maguire said. “People who are blind or have low vision have the same voting rights as anyone else, and those rights must be respected and upheld. “It’s simply unacceptable to strip that from our community with no assurance that an equivalent alternative will be put in place for the next election.” The commission had previously said it would need to extensively reconfigure the system before it could be used again. The commission said it was only able to “retain a small team of specialist resources to deliver iVote” due to funding constraints. During a budget estimates hearing last year, the electoral commissioner, John Schmidt, described his frustration at the process for applying for funds, describing it as “Kafkaesque” and a “circle of hell”.",News/Politics,"‘Unacceptable’: suspension of iVote system undermines rights of low vision Australians, expert says",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/22/unacceptable-suspension-of-ivote-system-undermines-rights-of-low-vision-australians-expert-says
3/22/2022,"A four-year working visa and a path to permanent residency should be offered to international graduates to help solve Australia’s skilled migrant shortage, according to a leading New South Wales think tank. The Committee for Sydney outlined the proposal to attract international students as part of its federal agenda released Tuesday, ahead of the May election. The group is also calling for major efforts to boost hosing affordability across the city, bolder action on climate change and a raft of measures to boost female participation in the workforce, including free childcare. Committee for Sydney chief executive Gabriel Metcalf said that after two and a half years of major environmental, economic and societal upsets, it’s hoped the nation’s leaders were emboldened to attempt real reform. “Our agenda is largely similar to what it would have been before the pandemic, but we’ve learned some things with more clarity,” Metcalf told the Guardian. “We’ve seen over the last couple of years, between the bushfires and the floods, just how much the impact of climate change is hitting Sydney and all of Australia. “We’ve learned more about some of the glaring inequalities. We saw that really vividly during Covid, so maybe there’s a new urgency. I hope so.” Metcalf said one of the biggest priorities for the federal government needed to be improving the flow of skilled migrants into Australia to ensure Sydney was able to grow after two years with closed borders. The Committee wanted to see automatic working visas for university graduates, which Metcalf hoped would also make Australia a more desirable choice for overseas students. “If you were to ask most major businesses today, they would say the number one thing holding them back is the labour shortage,” he said. “These would be people who’ve spent four years getting to know Australia so they know if they like it, they will have gotten the chance to work on their English skills. “The solution that is right in front of our eyes is the people who Australia has done a great job of educating. Allow them to remain.” The committee would also like the use of occupation lists for skilled migrants to be changed to make it easier for businesses to find people they need though the introduction of a wage-threshold test for employer- sponsored permanent visas. The agenda also lists action on climate change in Sydney’s future property, calling for a proactive economic transition plan away from fossil fuels and a net zero by 2040 target.",News/Australia news,"Visas for international graduates could help solve worker shortage, think tank says",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/22/visas-for-international-graduates-could-help-solve-worker-shortage-think-tank-says
3/22/2022,"The pace at which the Australian government is approving the destruction of habitat relied on by threatened species has increased in recent years, despite scientists warning of an escalating extinction crisis, according to an environment group analysis. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) compiled publicly available information on federal decisions that gave the green light to developments that involved clearing of forests and other areas relied on by threatened species. It found levelling of more than 200,000 hectares of threatened species habitat – an area larger than Queensland’s Fraser Island (K’gari), or more than 100,000 Melbourne Cricket Grounds – was approved over the decade to the end of 2021. More than half of that total (120,000 hectares) had been approved in the five years since 2016. ACF found nearly three-quarters of the clearing approved under national environment laws was for new and expanded mining developments. The most affected species was the koala, which in February was listed as endangered in New South Wales, Queensland and the ACT. The foundation found more than 25,000 hectares of koala habitat had been approved for clearing. A fifth of that was to make way for one mine, the Olive Downs metallurgical coalmine in central Queensland, which last year received a $175m federal government loan to support its construction. Other significantly affected threatened species included the critically endangered swift parrot, the greater glider (7,400 hectares), the forest red-tailed black cockatoo (1,800 hectares) and the spot-tailed quoll (1,200 hectares). Jess Abrahams, a national nature campaigner with ACF, said the investigation had exposed the cumulative impact of federal government decisions made in isolation. It showed the commonwealth was “aggravating extinction” rather than protecting vulnerable native animals, she said. Abrahams said federal data gave only a partial picture of land clearing across the country as two major industries – agriculture and native forest logging – were rarely assessed under national laws. Logging is effectively exempt from the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act under forestry deals between Canberra and the states. “If we value Australia’s unique wildlife and plants we must do more to protect them,” Abrahams said. “That means stronger environment laws to stop the rampant wrecking of habitat revealed by this research, increased funding and specific plans for threatened species recovery.” A spokesperson for the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, said the ACF analysis looked at only one aspect of the environmental approval process, and did not take into account offset requirements to protect threatened species or how much approved clearing had ultimately occurred. The spokesperson said $128.5m funding announced last week to “advance environmental law reform” would lead to better management of the cumulative impacts of developments in some areas by moving from project-specific to region-level assessment. It would also pay for a review of national offset strategies and improvements to data on threatened species, they said. The opposition’s environment spokesperson, Terri Butler, did not respond to questions before publication. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Dr Megan Evans, a lecturer and research fellow at the University of New South Wales in Canberra, said the results of the investigation were not surprising. Evans said the federal government had no central record of how much threatened species habitat remained and officials relied almost entirely on information provided by developers when assessing proposals. Developments were routinely approved with a promise that offsets to limit their environmental impact would be decided later, she said. “There is no centralised database of protected habitat data and offsets. The system is not transparent and it is getting worse,” she said. Australia is the world’s capital for mammal extinction, with 34 species known to have died out since European colonisation. Several studies, including an official review led by the former competition watchdog chief, Graeme Samuel, have found Australia’s natural environment is in decline and the EPBC Act is failing. A report by the auditor general last week found the federal government could not demonstrate it was protecting Australia’s endangered wildlife as it was not monitoring most species, habitats or threats. Meanwhile, a study by 38 scientists working across Australia and Antarctica last year found 19 ecosystems were collapsing due to the impact of humans and warned urgent action was required to prevent their complete loss.",News/Environment,"Australian government ‘aggravating extinction’ through land-clearing approvals, analysis finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/22/australian-government-aggravating-extinction-through-land-clearing-approvals-analysis-finds
3/22/2022,"Australian film-maker Ivan Sen’s sci-fi Loveland asks some very Philip K Dickian questions, about the nature of consciousness and posthuman evolution. Ryan Kwanten is Jack, a dead-eyed hitman who – like so many screen assassins before him – is glum and self-hating but yearns for something greater. His backstory justifies his emotional emptiness, though this does little to warm the audience to an unsympathetic lead, played with bleary-eyed moroseness. Films led by similar characters often use a love interest with distinct vulnerabilities to soften the hatched man’s misanthropy: like the woman hurt by Chow Yun-fat’s assassin in John Woo’s classic The Killer, fated to go blind without an operation, or the deaf-mute pharmacist Nicolas Cage dates in Bangkok Dangerous. In the wrong hands this sort of pairing serves a crude message: assassins have emotional needs too! There is an element of that in Loveland, when Sen introduces April (Jillian Nguyen), a singer Jack meets in a sleazy venue with the vibes of a brothel crossed with a karaoke bar. Picking her from a lineup of women, April performs for Jack from behind a one-way window, and the pair subsequently develop a relationship. He views April (consciously or not) as an opportunity for his spiritual revival, but there’s a catch: her presence, while emotionally restorative, appears to make him ill for weird science fiction-y reasons – and perhaps terminally so. In comes Dr Bergman, an enigmatic scientist played with gravitas by the ever-reliable Hugo Weaving, to figure out what is happening. Loveland is handsomely shot, continuing a collection of visually interesting productions from Sen, who serves as cinematographer, editor and composer. The film is set in a near future Hong Kong, though it feels more like an alternative present, with little obvious visual embellishment jazzing up the already futuristic looking city. This world is dotted with robot-like creations, posing familiar questions about the extent to which humans and machines are merging. At one point Jack asks: “Are they becoming more like us? Or are we becoming the machine?” This use of machines to consider human identity in increasingly virtual and digitialised societies has been explored so extensively that perhaps it’s time for sci-fi to move on. Literary critic N Katherine Hayles famously argued (more than 20 years ago) that people have already evolved into a posthuman state, the posthuman perspective privileging information over material forms in order to view biological embodiment as “an accident of history rather than an inevitability of life”. If that sounds a little heavy, wait until you hear the dialogue and narration in Loveland, which is weighty and ponderous from the beginning, but becomes jarringly so as the running time progresses. Or perhaps its heavy handedness just becomes more obvious when there is more of it: Jack is the narrator, then April gets a voiceover too – and so does Dr Bergman. This trio sure lays it on thick, countering gentle mysteries with writing seemingly devoted to violating the old “show don’t tell” dictum: expect lines such as, “What do you pray for, in the darkness?” and “No reason will sustain itself until dawn.” It’s almost impossible to make writing like this sound natural, so Sen aspires for a kind of heightened realism, somber and poetic – which is difficult to pull off without coming across as a bit tin-eared. Sen delivered weighty ponderousness much better in his outback noir Goldstone, another production that takes familiar genre mechanisms and slows them right down. In Loveland, the dialogue and narration is so full on that it becomes almost fourth wall-breaking in its artifice, pulling the viewer out of the experience by reminding us of the film-making (in particular the writing) process. This unquestionably ambitious film works best as a mood piece: it’s big, bold, cerebral and intensely unsubtle.",Arts/Film,"Loveland review – Hugo Weaving sci-fi flick is big, bold and ponderous",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/22/loveland-review-hugo-weaving-sci-fi-flick-is-big-bold-and-ponderous
3/22/2022,"In between lockdowns last year, I spent a week in Gippsland with a friend and her border collie, Queenie. The first morning, Queenie came bounding into my room, leapt on my bed and wriggled around until I got up and took her outside. We were staying on a big property on Lake Tyers. Queenie ran straight down the hill from the house towards the lake. By the time I caught up with her she had rolled in possum poo. Not wanting my friend to be woken up by a smelly dog, I decided to hose Queenie down. Still in my pyjamas, pre-coffee. It was very unpleasant for both of us. Possum poo aside, pets (especially Queenie) are a joy but can be troublesome when you’re trying to keep your clothes, shoes or pyjamas nice. This week some experts offer tips on protection and repair. Although it may seem obvious, keeping dogs or cats out of certain spaces and remembering to carefully put shoes and bags out of reach in closed cupboards is the most straightforward way to prevent your things from being damaged or soiled by a pet. The designer Christian Kimber owns a small beagle cross poodle called Ralph. To prevent Ralph’s hair from getting on his clothes he keeps him out of certain rooms of the house and off any furniture he, or his wife, Ren, might sit on. Kimber says: “We Scotchguard the rug and the couch too, which prevents dirt from sticking, particularly if his paws are damp for any reason.” A straightforward solution to pet hair sticking to your clothes is to change into patting-friendly outfits as soon as you walk in the door. Kimber says, “when we know we’re spending a lot of time with him, we avoid dark colours” as Ralph is blonde, “ditto delicate fabrics like linen, silk or fine knits his nails might pull”. Of course, this isn’t always practical and loose fur sticking to you is pretty inevitable. Kimber says, “the best way to minimise the fuzz … is to brush your pet regularly”, something it’s best to do outside. Once the fur has already shed, Kimber suggests using a heavy-duty vacuum cleaner, “and all the attachments” to tackle any furniture that may transfer hair to your clothes. For garments he recommends a lint brush over sticky rollers (which can leave traces of stickiness on clothes), and says he always has one in the car, since “you can’t really avoid a fur bomb at close quarters”. Cleaning expert Shannon Lush suggests a simple pair of rubber gloves for removing pet hair. Just wash your hands with the gloves on, and while they’re slightly tacky, run them over any garments (or other cloth surfaces like couches) that have hair on them. You can also use wet gloves to pat your dog or cat, from head to tail – all the loose hair should come off on the gloves, at which point you can gather the hair up into a ball for easy disposal. It is also important to remove any fur from clothing before putting it in the washing machine, as washing isn’t that effective at removing hair from clothes. Dionna Newton, the founder of Animal Behaviour Australia, says when pets are chewing shoes, scratching things or peeing where they shouldn’t, “there’s a motivation behind why the animal feels the need to do that”. If your new puppy has chewed on your favourite shoes, this can be because of a lack of mental stimulation. She says younger dogs get bored and “need more varied stimulation than we think” so it’s important to keep them entertained with games or walks. If you have a cat that is urinating where they shouldn’t, the reasons can be more complicated. Sometimes, they can smell clothes that have been outside, and it is a territorial response. For particularly anxious cats, it may be because there is a new cat in the neighbourhood, or something in the house has changed, like the placement of furniture. Sometimes, it’s just because urinating releases feelgood chemicals. If your cat is scratching things, Newton says to “make sure you have enough scratching posts, or things you don’t mind it scratching” around the house. It’s also important to provide the cat with different textures to scratch. Newton says it’s worth getting a professional behavioural assessment to work out why the cat is behaving this way, and then solutions can be put in place. Lush says to get rid of the smell of cat urine, you have to be sure you get rid of all of it, which can be tricky because cats spray when they pee. She recommends using an ultraviolet light to see exactly where pee might have landed, then marking all splashes with chalk. To get the pee out of clothes, she suggests using white vinegar. Start by pouring the vinegar into a jug and stretching the affected garment over a large bowl, then pour the vinegar through the fabric, empty the bowl back into the jug and repeat until you feel satisfied the urine is gone. Then put the garment through a regular wash. It is best to wash clothes using an enzyme-based detergent, as enzymes work to break down organic material so any residual odours should be eliminated. There are several laundry detergents on the market that deal specifically with pet urine, including a few laundry boosters that can be used as pre-treatment or in addition to regular detergent. Older urine stains will be harder to remove, so be sure to put clothes straight in the wash. The good news is, shoes and bags that have been attacked by a pet can usually be repaired. According to Jenny Velakoulis, the owner of Evans Leather Repair in Melbourne’s Royal Arcade, it’s pretty rare for them to see something so ravaged by an animal it has passed the point of no return. Fixing a gnawed shoe or handbag requires a combination of taking the “bit that’s been chewed and mangled and building it up again”, as well as replacing soles, heels or straps that have been partially eaten. Velakoulis recommends having rubber soles added to all your shoes, because they make it much harder for a dog’s teeth to do damage. There are also several products available, such as bitter sprays, that are designed to prevent your pet from chewing things.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Paws off: protecting clothes from your pets (and what to do when you’ve failed),https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/22/paws-off-protecting-clothes-from-your-pets-and-what-to-do-when-youve-failed

I wanted to only talk about what all the others could only talk about: Covid. Do children really not get sick? Will the supply chain hold up? Is your work OK? What’s happening in China? Italy, the country, has locked down! Should we take the children out? Will you take the children out? What are you going to do? It was 23 March 2020. Later that morning the then New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced that parents and carers should keep their children home from school wherever possible. That was it. That’s what we were going to do. I went to Kmart and bought stationery – new scrap paper, coloured pads, pipe cleaners. OK. Let’s go. Nearly two years later, at 3pm on a Friday afternoon, my phone rang. My youngest, at daycare, had a temperature pushing 39C. We collected her, my partner held her defiant head against his chest as he gave her a RAT (negative) and we looked at each other. Is it? That night she woke, whimpering and feverish, and climbed into our bed as she always does when she’s sick. I didn’t sleep as I watched her belly, hot to the touch, rise and fall and kept replacing the folded-up wet face washer on her forehead. I held her hand and breathed her exhalation. Two mornings later, she and her sister tested positive for Covid. OK, I thought. Let’s go. We ordered stationery online – new scrap paper. Less paper though, this time, because we would only be in isolation for a week. I knew the things to do. We had done it before. We have all done it before. I had managed through weeks upon weeks of simultaneous home learning, working and childcare. I had all the strategies – I’d written a bloody guide on it. I’d made posters of activities the children could take to whenever they were bored. I’d made calendars studded with locked down family “events” to break up the weeks. I’d scheduled Friday night drinks and trivia with friends and family. I knew to exercise and stay connected to friends. And Lego – we had so much Lego now. I knew what to do. I’d done it before. I’d done it for longer. But this was different. On day three of those seven days, I was on the phone to someone – I can’t remember who. There was noise, maybe chaos, in the background, my partner was sick and was holing up in a single bed in the playroom. I’d been working. “And how are you doing?” she asked. “I’m fine,” I replied, but as I spoke I was startled: my voice cracked. Instantly, involuntarily, a wet heat fired at the base of my eyes. What was that? Of course I’m fine. This is just seven days. Seven days. I am fine. I’ve done it before. But I was not fine. In this totally fine, totally temporary half life of isolation, what had been held together during all those months of lockdowns was coming apart. “This feels worse,” I texted friends who had gone through it. “It is worse,” they replied. We could not work out why. What was different about this shorter, totally fine lockdown? Why was it this – this stupid single week – that was breaking us? “It’s the endlessness of it all. That’s what’s really biting,” says professor Jayashri Kulkarni, an expert in women’s mental health and director of the Monash Alfred Psychiatry Research Centre. “People are saying: ‘Where’s the end point?’ “Covid keeps delivering another whammy,” she says, as Omicron tears through schools, case numbers increase again and the smoke of a new variant rises beyond the horizon. “A lot of anxiety is getting worse, and women feel it worse.” This isn’t news. A study from the pandemic’s first year, in Victoria, found that 79% of women reported a decline in their mental health, compared with 52% of men. A 2021 report from the Women’s Mental Health Alliance, again in Victoria, found that there had been further increase in women’s mental distress during the second lockdown. Earlier this month, the World Health Organization reported that in the first year of Covid, anxiety and depression had increased worldwide by 25% – and that women and young people, as well as those with pre-existing conditions, were most badly affected. This latest bout of isolation brought with it a new frontier of exhaustion. Prof Kulkarni says it is those additional caring roles that women take on for older relatives and children, the informal healthcare they provide in the home which adds up; they are the ones who figure out how to keep this child away from that one, what symptoms are severe enough to keep a child home from school and soothes their seven-year-old’s terror when the positive line appears on their test. “Again and again, women are tested,” says Kulkarni. The women are exhausted. It affects everyone, of course. Those who have experienced hotel quarantine or the harshest of lockdown restrictions will know better than most; it is the tenor of isolation itself which presents the challenge. Going through it alone, without the camaraderie of a community lockdown. It is the relinquishing of control over your activities. It is the absence of the outdoors, even for a short walk. It is the threat of infection, the toll of the sickness the virus induces itself which weighs those seven days down so heavily. This is not an argument against isolation periods, so clearly vital to managing the virus. It is an acknowledgment, nearly two years to the day that children were told to stay away from school and our worlds changed forever, that even though we call it Covid-normal, it isn’t. And for some of us, all that exhaustion and not-normality, can come to a head in an innocuous seven days at home. But it ends. On our release, on a drizzly Sunday morning, I held my daughters’ hands as we walked out of the house to get breakfast. As I did I felt the weight of the building lift off me, brick by beam. It ends, it ends.",Opinion/Opinion,I thought I was fine parenting through Covid isolation.
