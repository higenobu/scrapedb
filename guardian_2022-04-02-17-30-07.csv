4/2/2022,"Everybody needs good neighbours. And that’s never more true than when you are renovating your home. Moving in a skip, or a tribe of builders for a few weeks, or even months, can test the strongest of friendships – so what can you do to keep relations good? If you are carrying out construction or excavation work on a boundary, or land close to neighbours’ homes, or undertaking building work that involves adjoining or shared walls, you may be required by law under the Party Wall Act 1996 to serve a notice, typically at least two months before the job begins. You can serve the notice yourself using the free example “party structure notice” letter on gov.uk, or pay a party wall surveyor to do it for you – this normally costs a small fixed fee of about £100 or less. But first, speak to your neighbours and find out whether they are comfortable consenting to the notice or if they want a party wall surveyor to draw up an award. This will dictate how the building work covered by the act should be carried out, and you will pay for it to be drawn up. A good first step is to share the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) party wall consumer guide with your neighbour, which explains the process. If they then want to hire a party wall surveyor, ask them whether you can come up with a shortlist together, and agree on a single one you are both happy with, to act impartially for both of you. You should then ask that surveyor to serve your notice. If you fail to agree on a single surveyor, then you, as the homeowner carrying out the work, will have to pay for two: one for you and one for your neighbour. Most surveyors charge between £100 and £200 an hour to draw up a party wall award, depending on where you live, and you may have more than one neighbour you need to serve a notice to, so costs can easily run into thousands. Always try to agree on a surveyor who is a member of Rics, advises Michael Cooper, a Rics fellow who is head of neighbourly matters at Cooper’s Building Surveyors. All Rics surveyors undergo professional training, abide by a code of conduct and have a complaints handling procedure. “There’s redress against Rics surveyors acting inappropriately or illegally – or simply not doing a very good job,” he says. You can find one via the find a surveyor tool on the Rics website. Look for one who is also a member of the Pyramus & Thisbe Club, a group for party wall surveyors. Ideally, tell your neighbours what is going to happen on site, before it happens, and update them about any issues that might affect them. For example, if you can, give them notice of deliveries that will block the road or the arrival of a skip on a street where there is limited parking. “Keep neighbours informed about when builders are going to start work, any likely noise that’s going to happen, the level of disruption, skips and major deliveries,” says Brian Berry, the chief executive of the Federation of Master Builders. If an aspect of your work seriously disrupts, or inconveniences, your neighbours, and they cannot stop you going ahead with your plans, it may cause an upset. The best way to avoid this kind of problem is to be as open and collaborative as possible from the start, says Alicia Drummond, an adolescent therapist and the founder of TeenTips.co.uk. “Give them time to adjust to the idea, and acknowledge their feelings,” she adds. For example, you could say: “I know the idea of us doing this extension is upsetting for you: if there is anything we can do to make it easier, please let us know.” But the reality, Berry says, is, “no one can wave a magic wand … It is going to be inconvenient.” Ultimately, all you can do is explain that you need to get the work done, and you will try to keep them informed and minimise disruptions as much as possible. Whatever happens, don’t take a neighbour’s objections personally. “They are protecting their assets in the same way that you are trying to maximise yours,” Drummond says. Before the project starts, offer to introduce your builder to your neighbours and make them aware of the hours tradespeople will be working. Your neighbour may have a say, via the party wall award, over when certain works governed by the Party Wall Act can take place. Otherwise, your builder should only have to abide by the local authority’s rules. “In most cases, it’s generally OK to carry out building work between 8am and 5pm on a weekday and Saturday morning,” says Jason Orme, a property expert for the Homebuilding & Renovating Show. Ensure your builder sticks to the hours set by your local authority, and only carries out party wall works during the hours agreed in your party wall award. You could also ask all your tradespeople to take care not to disturb neighbours unnecessarily by, for example, shouting or playing loud music while working outside. “If you choose a reputable builder, they will be concerned about their own professional reputation,” Berry says. A good builder will also have experience communicating and understanding people’s concerns. When the work is complete, it is polite to thank your neighbours for putting up with all the disruption. As a goodwill gesture, you could pay for their windows to be professionally cleaned of any dust your builder has created. There is, however, no need to offer any compensation for the inconvenience they have suffered, Orme says. “The best way to repair any fraught relationships is with a bottle of wine, some toys for the kids and a cheery disposition,” he adds. “You’ll never be able to reconcile with some neighbours – but that’s life.” Once you have found someone to do your work you will need to sign a contract and hand over a deposit. Before you do, make sure your deposit is protected – a good company should be signed up to a scheme to insure your money against it going out of business. Ask for details before you pay. Most schemes let you check on their websites for companies that are registered with them. “If a builder goes bust and there is no insurance protecting the customer, they would have to go down the creditor route, or, if they paid their deposit with a credit card, may be able to claim that money back from the credit card company,” says Rico Wojtulewicz, the head of housing and planning policy at the National Federation of Builders. Unfortunately, many tradespeople do not take credit card payments, so this might not be an option. Also get details of the builder’s insurance and make sure it is up to date and will cover damage to your property or if anything happens to a neighbour’s home. Your home insurance is unlikely to cover problems resulting from major work such as a loft conversion or extension. You should tell your insurer before you get this kind of work done, as it could have an impact on any claim you make. At the heart of a successful home improvement project is a good builder – and your relationship with them can help everything go smoothly. Eddie Marku at ProntoBuild, based in central Ruislip, has tips on how to get on:  Trust your builder and communicate with them. If your builder is experienced there’s nothing they wouldn’t have encountered before. They’ll help you along with it.  Take advice. Use research to determine what you want – the advice from your builder will help you achieve it by tailoring things for your project specifically.  Buy the things you are supplying in good time. Have them ready and on site for when they’ve been requested. Lead times (especially in the current climate) can vary hugely.  Consider all aspects of a decision carefully before making a final choice. Indecisiveness and changing your mind frequently leads to a messy project.  Don’t try to remember – when your builder asks you for something either ask for it in writing or write it down. It’ll make your life a whole lot easier when dealing with suppliers. Anything you’re unsure of, ask and clarify with your builder before purchasing.  The builder should be able to get hold of you (within reason) each day in case there are decisions to be made. It’s ideal to have a face to face chat, though that’s not always possible. Weekly meeting are good to resolve big decisions and confirm plans.  You should be able to go on site each day if you just want to have a look around and see progress. But ideally it’s best to let the workers get on with it throughout the day. Hanging over their heads won’t make the project proceed any faster.  You’ll always have a designated person which is your main point of contact. Speak to that person with all queries and communication to avoid confusion.  Cups of tea and coffee are always welcome. Our sites are normally derelict and clients normally come with pizzas or chicken which always goes down a treat. It refuels both energy and morale for the rest of the day.",Lifestyle/Money,Building work: how to avoid driving your neighbours up the wall,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/02/building-work-neighbours-wall-home-renovations
4/2/2022,"A host of warm weather species moving north into Scotland have been given new Gaelic names, reflecting the subtle but significant environmental shifts brought by climate heating. Following work by dozens of lexicographers, naturalists and Gaelic artists, the firecrest, one of the UK’s tiniest birds, now luxuriates under the delicate Gaelic words for flaming, wee, little thing, or crìonag lasrach. The azure damselfly is now cruinneag liath, or grey, neat young girl, while the common rosefinch has become little red creature of the briar or deargan drise. The bearded tit, a bird mostly resident in southern and eastern England, is now the moustached reed-worker or cuilcear staiseach. The project, devised by the wildlife artist Derek Robertson and endorsed by Scotland’s Gaelic language and nature conservation agencies, has identified 40 species that are recent arrivals in Scotland that lack formal Gaelic names. The full inventory, which is being finalised, is due to be published in June in a new book edited by Robertson, featuring his watercolours of each species and a short three-line poem in Gaelic on each by the Skye-based Irish poet Rody Gorman. Later this year, an exhibition will take the paintings and translations to the Western Isles, Fife and the Scottish Poetry Library in Edinburgh. Robertson said the project was designed to update the Gaelic lexicon in a way that embraced the language’s intimate, historic connections to the landscape and Scotland’s natural heritage. “Gaelic has a rich tradition of naming things which is really beautiful,” he said. Gaelic, like many languages, will adopt words from other languages. Gaels will also devise informal translations. A consensus emerged that for these species, which are now settled or encroaching in Scotland, a more formal process of naming was needed. “Languages borrow words all the time and that is a process for any living language,” he said. “But Gaelic has a very strong connection with the natural world and that is reflected in its naming of things.” Some are exotic species brought to Britain by the Victorians and Edwardians. Those include the muntjac, a diminutive deer originally native to China which escaped from country house parks in the home counties. In Gaelic, it is now fiadh-comhartaich or barking deer. Even the red-necked wallaby, the Australian marsupial that colonised the island of Inchconnachan on Loch Lomond after it was imported by a former owner, has been captured by the project. Its name translates as uallabaidh ruadh-mhuinealach. Others were accidental introductions and some Gaelic names are quite literal: the Iberian three-banded slug is now seilcheag thrì-stiallach Ibeirianach or three-streaked Iberian slug; the leathery sea squirt is now spùtachan-mara leatharach, for leathery little squirting creature of the sea. The project, endorsed by Bòrd na Gàidhlig, the Gaelic language agency, and NatureScot, the government conservation agency, could also help build interest in the language amongst non-native or lapsed speakers, said Mark McConville, a linguist at Glasgow university who specialises in Gaelic lexicography. Recent reports have warned that Gaelic is in danger of dying out as a living language, with the number of native speakers rapidly dwindling, and its catchment shrinking to the Hebrides and far west of Scotland. Those areas are also suffering the negative impacts of climate heating: sea level rise threatens coastlines, intensifying storms and harming sensitive native species. “Music is one route into learning Gaelic and nature is definitely one of those too,” he said. “Any language starts from a place and comes from a place, and the way words are formed is intimately connected with that place. We definitely see this with Gaelic.” surf scoterlach-dhubh tuinne or black (wild) duck of the wave This north American sea duck sometimes appears during winter on Orkney, Shetland or Fair Isle in the far north of Scotland; its bill is adapted to eat mussels and other bivalves. firecrestcrìonag lasrach or flaming, wee, little thing It vies with its cousin the goldcrest for the title as the UK’s tiniest bird; males have bright orange and yellow streaks on their heads.

4/2/2022,"“I cannot take all of these losses,” I said to my therapist, The Great Wayne, as I lay down, sniffling on his absurdly proto-Freudian Peruvian rug-covered couch. I had a list of large and small losses: my parents (whom I miss every day, but orphaned at 55 does not feel like someone has done me wrong); my old house (which I miss only at the holidays when my new house is an exploding clown car of children and grandkids); my perfect, helpful and unintrusive nextdoor neighbour who moved away suddenly, replaced by someone who is none of the above; my older sister, hospitalised twice; and, more than all of these, my husband, Brian, my constant companion and best beloved, who had been gone from me and from this world for a month. Brian was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at 65, and, having seen its ravages in his own family and witnessed his own decline, he was determined not to make what he called “the long goodbye”. I supported and helped and wept, every day, while he arranged for his own peaceful and painless assisted suicide at Dignitas, in Switzerland. I flip over on the couch, to look at Wayne, hopefully. He is very old, quietly kind and nobody’s fool. He wears monstrous orthopedic shoes, has the eyebrows of Robert Morley and gets in and out of his armchair with hydraulic assistance. Wayne glances at me. “You cannot take all of these losses,” he says. He laughs out loud. “Buckle up, kid. It only gets worse.” He says it with such good cheer, and such frank surprise that a sensible person like myself would think that moping and moaning was the best approach, that I laugh, too. And the two of us are cackling away, him nearly ossified in his hi-tech armchair, me, curled into a wet ball. I will get about four in-person sessions with Wayne, from early February to early March, talking and sometimes napping on the slightly grotty, very reassuring rug-covered couch and then Covid will come down like the snow in Joyce’s The Dead, just a few flakes at first fluttering into a wide, relentless storm, transforming the world. After Brian’s death, what I thought would be months, years, of private grief and me tottering my small, dark, detached way through the world as a widow, turns out to be Life all over me; grief, like the turtles of Hindu cosmography, is grief all the way down, small on top of big. There were regular tsunamis of rage and loss that left me wiped out, soaking wet but still lodged firmly in the turtle pile. Brian had come into my life quietly, although he wasn’t a quiet man. We liked each other for years as neighbours, then tumbled into love, then caused a little scandal in our little town, then settled, as even the most scandalous do, into everyday life, and then, just as we were hitting our stride as very settled people and devoted grandparents, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. I gave away most of his clothes, except the undershirts that smelled like him and his father’s grand, louche silk bathrobe, which I wore, while mourning, while watching TV nonstop. I couldn’t finish reading a single page of prose. (Derry Girls and Jane Kenyon. Shetland and Auden.) I discovered that, having occasionally watched American football with Brian for 15 years and having made a small effort to understand it (having grown up in a family in which even the men were amused and disdainful about sports-fandom), I now hated it and was fiercely glad to talk about what a disgusting, cruel and dangerous game it was. (Brian and his neurologist both thought that football was the cause of his dementia as it has been for so many football players. I knew that Brian would not have given it up; if he’d been offered a time-travelling chance, he would have stayed with football, but as far as I was concerned, football had killed him.) I knew that I was only a few steps short of harassing people in stadiums and even those not in stadiums. And even those not supporting the NFL, even those whose only crimes were living, unconcerned. I began writing an account of our life together and Brian’s death, crying, drinking more tea and watching the cold sea from my office window. I found it impossible to talk about much of anything (except the Scandinavian murder mysteries/international dating shows I’d watched between 3 and 5am). Brian’s memorial service was on 8 February, in the library across the street from our house. It was the poem he wanted (Szymborska’s Allegro Ma Non Troppo), the minister he wanted (an old friend, who had advised me not to marry Brian and then relented), the music he wanted (Bill Evans). His mother and siblings came and they held a second memorial service on 22 February, near his family home, in Pennsylvania, a few hours from me. It was lovingly centred on the young Brian, the big, long-haired, pot-smoking footballer, before he left home for university. The music was not what he would have chosen and he had largely stopped watching sports, but he would have loved all the remembrances by men in their mid-60s who appreciated him as a tough defensive lineman and a warm-hearted (hot-headed) pal. It was a little bit out-of-body for me. I hardly knew any faces in the crowd and most of them didn’t know me. I was very aware, very suddenly, that I was a blip (albeit a 15-year blip) in his life and I found it rawly painful – all that I missed, all that we wouldn’t get. Back from the second funeral, hoping that I’d behaved well, I shed my mourning clothes, brushed out my beehive (those funerals pushed me, strongly, into later-Sophia-Loren territory and I wanted very much to be done with the black coats and black jumpsuits and massive black sunglasses, which I should have bought by the gross, and be returned to my own mild denim frowsiness) and – to my surprise – I went shopping. I replaced the dining-room table and chairs Brian and I spent 10 years planning to get rid of. I began to peruse The World of Interiors the way another, better person might be rereading Proust or The Iliad. I ordered two little couches for my living room (in the magazine, this clever idea of back-to-back couches is located in a living room the size of a swimming pool. Mine is not.) and it felt cosy, and I found that I was completely uninterested in anyone else’s opinion of this arrangement. I sit in one couch and read and then saunter into my tiny kitchen and sashay over to the other couch, scone in hand. All of my appliances break down and I call Susie Chang, my excellent tarot card reader to find out if this is Brian, from the other side, signalling wistfully or perhaps angrily to me. Not at all. Although very popular in certain kinds of movies and TV shows, this signalling is not exciting to Susie. She does not suggest exorcism or sage. I tell her I have called the plumber, the electrician and the dishwasher guy, and she says that sounds like a good idea. I follow up by asking her if Brian is all right; if he has, maybe, turned into a salmon (he liked to fish). She says, in a flat, sensible voice: that’s not a thing that happens. I tell Wayne about my conversation with Susie Chang, expecting a little well-modulated mockery. He nods and thinks. “Not a salmon, eh?” I cry every night and every morning but I am up by sunrise, feeling less sodden. I am not optimistic but I am not particularly worried. I am not in a hurry. I am not urgently moved by my obligations but I want not to worry my children and I want to continue to be a good grandmother. I find the grief, kindness and harshness of others completely unbearable. I talk to Brian’s photographs. I call Brian’s mother every 10 days. I’m not looking forward to anything at all, but I see a few early snowdrops in my yard and I’m so glad I go out into the snow in my slippers to admire them. I drink a lot of tea and I eat toast. I make dinner (more toast and sometimes noodles). I am wading in the grief, still sifting through the last few difficult years, moving slow but not uncomfortable. I am in no hurry to get back to anything that looks like real life. Or even a shoddy simulacrum of life. You can just keep it all, is my view. By early March, my grown children and I are all exchanging texts about Covid. Do we need to get masks? Is it nonsense? Is it just another name for the flu? Will schools stay open? I buy a box of 50 masks online, get dressed, and go to the bank and withdraw a lot of cash. I put it in my nightstand and feel like my own grandmother. My younger daughter calls me on a Friday night, beside herself with worry and work, to say that she and her wife have just been informed that they are no longer allowed to go to their offices and will both be working full-time, and from home and that their three-year-old’s preschool programme is closed for the indefinite future. (The indefinite future will turn out to be nine months.) By the end of the weekend, my daughter, Sarah, her wife, Jasmine, and little Zora arrive with their small car piled high, escaping from Brooklyn. I am glad to see them, they are glad to see me. In the mornings, I watch Zora so her mothers can get in at least four-to-five hours of work. We play hide and seek, mostly in my bedroom closet. Zora discovers she can hide in the laundry basket. Zora discovers that Nana can hide in the shower stall. We find these things hilarious. We watch Plim Plim, a Latin American animated series about a child who is a clown, a hero and a magician. His friends are animals, each with one personality trait. We watch bits and pieces of 140 Minutos de Capítulos Nuevos y Completos every morning, and Zora decides that we should always watch it in the armchair in my bedroom, squishing in next to each other. Every morning, she instructs me: Squish! Plim Plim! I find myself humming Los Canciones Infantiles and La Vaca Lola. My shred of Spanish is improved and Zora’s is certainly better than mine. My daughter-in-law offers to cook dinner, every night. I’m gobsmacked and slow to respond because I think I must have misunderstood her. I made dinner for four or five people most nights for 30 years. The idea that Jasmine, not yet 40 and parent of one, would volunteer to cook dinner every night for the four of us astonished me. “I hope I’m not overstepping,” she said. I hugged her. “Step away,” I said. “Please.” Jasmine cooked interesting and healthful meals that were consistently delicious, more than I could have done on all three counts, and dinner was on the table by 6pm. My daughter washed the dishes. I had the pleasure of being a guest at my own table, and it was a pleasure. I also had the pleasure of seeing my daughter’s happy marriage up close. I sat, every day, in their happiness, in their parental fatigue, in Zora’s flow of new words and blossoming of self, in their family-building, in which I was included. The broken pieces of my life turned out to be hospitable to new life, flowers and grass growing in the dead log. I planned to have a tree for Brian in my back yard. I planned to bury the urn of his ashes next to the roots of the tree, and I planned to have a small brass plaque attached to the boulder near where I wanted the tree. First, I Googled pictures of all kinds of trees, as if I were on were an aborist dating app. Too big, too small, too narrow, too mangy. The linden tree is handsome, bushy and green but its superpower is the scent of its small yellow flowers: pure honey. (Also, makes a nice tea.) I talked to Wayne about the kind of tree that would best represent Brian. I talked about trees passionately and hypothetically all winter, and then, after offering Wayne a number of choices and his refusing to do anything but listen, I bought Brian’s linden tree. The tree I wanted cost twice as much as I’d wanted to spend and would be delivered several seasons later, and I decided that there would be no stopping me. All spring and summer, I sat on the little hill where the tree would be. I found the Rumi poem that would go on the plaque. I ordered the plaque, which was also twice as expensive as I’d hoped and would also be slow in coming, by a few months. I found all the white perennials that could surround the linden tree and on the day the gardeners suddenly arrived, almost a year after his death, to put this huge tree into the yard, the plaque was there, the urn was there and I was happy to be there and the weeping didn’t change that. Also with me, at a polite distance from me and from the tree, was a man who had come to see me for lunch, having read a novel of mine and recognised my name from when we had been friends 30 years ago, when our children played together. We did have lunch and I cried some more and when he went home, I called Wayne. “I have all these feelings,” I said. “It’s like Grand Central Terminal in here; loss coming in and going out, happiness coming in and going out. Grief, platform five, all aboard. Changing trains, next stop, for … Change. Mind the gap. I cannot take it,” I said. Wayne laughed.  In Love by Amy Bloom is published by Granta Books (£16.99).

The quality of acts featured – including John Grant and Self Esteem – is impressive enough, but the wider programme is teeming with activities for all ages, including a Wilderwild area to learn about nature or just chill out.29 to 31 July, Baldersby Park, Topcliffe The Big FeastivalFor those about to roquefort: the music and foodie blowout staged at Alex James’s Cotswolds cheese farm is high-profile enough to secure the really big names. Which is why, along with headliners such as Anne-Marie, there will also be a personal appearance by beloved kids TV pup star Bluey. It’s just part of a wide-ranging, family-friendly menu that includes cookery workshops for little chefs and celebrity-read bedtime stories.26 to 28 August, Kingham, nr Chipping NortonGraeme Virtue Sound CityLiverpool’s Sound City celebrates its 15th anniversary with headline slots from Self Esteem and the Lathums, and plenty more acts besides across emerging indie, pop and alt-folk. It’s real selling point is its conference events, introducing you to new artists while also giving you the inspirational pointers to think about becoming one yourself. Go all out and make a long weekend of it – it’s a bank holiday after all.30 April to 1 May, various venues, Liverpool The Great EscapeFor those who like to boast about early adoption, it doesn’t come much better than Brighton’s Great Escape. A new-music trainspotter’s paradise, it showcases more than 400 artists from around the globe, and has earned a reputation as a serious industry networking event, with acts being signed and spotlighted on the strength of their live buzz. Current must-sees include Denise Chaila, Sipho and Yard Act, but you’ll need to get down early; those hot-ticket rooms fill up fast.11 to 14 May, various venues, Brighton Wide AwakeA two-dig shindig in Brockwell Park, south London, Wide Awake has the scale of a traditional field festival, but the intimacy of a closely curated lineup. Primal Scream will provide the familiar headline hits, but otherwise it’s a veritable feast of newbie names who make music that sits a little adjacent to the mainstream: Floating Points, Chubby and the Gang, Faye Webster, Fatoumata Diawara. A strong focus on environmental sustainability marks it out as promisingly conscious event, in keeping with its innovative ethos.27 & 28 May, Brockwell Park, London Live at LeedsHaving rejigged its post-pandemic approach, Live at Leeds is now an umbrella brand for two events: a traditional park-based festival (taking place on 4 June, with Bombay Bicycle Club headlining), and the multivenue approach we all know and love. The inner-city version takes place in October, allowing you to pound the Yorkshire pavement without the risk of sunburn or inadvertent exposure to a lukewarm overpriced pint. Start at the Brudenell Social Club, and work backwards into the city centre; acts are TBC, but venue curation is always on pointe.4 June, Temple Newsam; 15 October, various venues, Leeds LeisureTaking place at Margate’s Dreamland after a successful trial run in 2019, Leisure festival returns for 2022 with its new and improved boutique focus. Seeking to champion new artists and inclusive gender parity, it’s already making good with a selection of indie’s best and brightest: Mitski, Soccer Mommy, Nilüfer Yanya, Sorry, HighSchool and L’Rain. Check out some new names, and then hit the Roller Disco – it’s a contemporary twist on quintessential British seaside holiday.24 June, Dreamland, MargateJW Mighty HooplaA festival that actively embraces the life-changing magic of getting dressed up, Mighty Hoopla is a rare event that treats pop music with the reverence it deserves, creating a haven for the LGBTQIA+ community. Cascada, Booty Luv, Anastacia and Sugababes will be bringing the nostalgia, while Jessie Ware, Big Freedia and Confidence Man stake their claim as future-forward entertainers. Catch us down the front for Romeo & Lisa Maffia, the stuff of true millennial dreams.3 & 4 June, Brockwell Park, London DownloadIt is a truth universally known that metalheads are among the friendliest of music fans, which makes Download a real treat for those looking to foster a bit of campsite camaraderie. The headliners are perhaps a little uninspired at this point (Kiss, Iron Maiden, Biffy Clyro), but further down the list there are some great new names to be found: Static Dress, Yonaka, Loathe and Drag Race’s very own Bimini will all bring a fresh take on alt-rock.10 to 12 June, Donington Park, Castle Donington Mad CoolTaking place in sunny Madrid, Mad Cool 2022 more than makes up for its pandemic fallow year with a veritable feast of heavy-hitters and breakout stars: Metallica, Stormzy, Florence + the Machine, Phoebe Bridgers, Sam Fender. There’s a reason many UK acts cite it as one of their favourites to play: the diverse lineup and warm weather come together to create a vibe that feels a little like an overseas Glastonbury, with a site that is much more conveniently compact.6 to 10 July, Madrid, Spain The Beat-Herder festivalA fan favourite in the strongest sense, Beat-Herder is a festival that draws back the same down-to-earth crowds year on year, irrespective of that year’s chosen musical roster. If you’re into your dance music and don’t mind pulling some serious all-nighters, get your ticket booked; those famed 4am karaoke sessions at the onsite Working Men’s Club need to be seen to be believed.14 to 17 July, Dockber Farm, Sawley, nr Clitheroe Lost VillageFancy surrendering yourself to four days of decadence in a long-forgotten Lincolnshire forest? Putting the capital E in Experience, Lost Village caters to those who like their festivals to have a strong conceptual focus, blending music, food, comedy and wellbeing workshops in an immersive setting. It’s well established but still small enough to feel special, and you’ll leave with a much stronger sense of self … or at very least, a particularly impressive hangover.25 to 28 August, nr NewarkJW RewireBilled as a festival of “adventurous” music and interdisciplinary performance, the Dutch Rewire has a broad programme steered more by a state of mind than anything else. On the bill you’ll find acts such as Grouper, Jenny Hval and the Bug alongside lesser-known and emerging names, plus a range of club nights, installations, talks, screenings and more unfolding in concert halls, theatres, churches, night clubs, galleries and public spaces across The Hague.7 to 10 April, The Hague, Netherlands Afro NationIt’s a big year for Afrobeats in Portugal, with both Rolling Loud and Afro Nation bringing their festivals to the Algarve for 2022. With previous events in Ghana and Puerto Rico, Afro Nation has the accolade of being the world’s biggest festival focused on Afrobeats, dancehall, bashment, R&B and hip-hop. With Burna Boy, Wizkid, Beenie Man and Pa Salieu in the lineup and a site on the Praia da Rocha beach that looks like a Tui brochure come to life, it’s clear why.1 to 3 July, Portimão, Portugal 2000 Trees2000 Trees is to punk-leaning rock what Green Man is to folk-leaning rock and indie: a perfect mid-sized festival serving a blend of household and underground names and community vibes. Held in the Cotswold Hills, this year’s lineup boasts Jimmy Eat World, Thrice, Laura Jane Grace and Turnstile plus a stack of UK darlings such as Idles, Chubby and the Gang and Mclusky. A great time for those of us still dedicated to skinny jeans.7 to 9 July, Upcote Farm, Withington, nr Cheltenham WomadAs far as music, art and dance festivals go, Glastonbury might have the monopoly on the extremes of wholesomeness and hedonism, but Womad is the king of eclecticism. More than 150 artists from 50 countries will make their way to Charlton Park, including the Flaming Lips, Fatoumata Diawara and Greentea Peng, while this year’s free workshop programme offers everything from Brazilian folkloric dance to Palestinian singing to Iyengar yoga. The phrase “something for everyone” was never more apt.28 to 31 July, Charlton Park, nr Malmesbury We Out HereIf you’re looking for somewhere to listen to Brazilian jazz-funk but also partake in wild swimming and a roller disco, We Out Here has all of that and then some. Curated and organised by Gilles Peterson, the Cambridgeshire festival is a lifesize celebration of all the underground club music pies the legendary DJ has had his fingers in over the years, bringing together young and pioneering artists across soul, hip-hop, house, afro, electronica and beyond. And before you ask, yes, there will be “crisp sound and production”.25 to 28 August, Abbots Ripton, nr HuntingdonEG Timber festivalStaged among the copses of Feanedock – a 70-acre woodland on the Leicestershire/Derbyshire border – Timber is an eco-shindig of music, art and ideas where the national forest setting is the star. While the diverse three-day programme is all about raising natural awareness with storytelling, hands-on workshops and environmental art, there is also the primal attraction of raving it up in a secluded magical dell.1 to 3 July, Feanedock, nr Ashby de la Zouch Belladrum Tartan Heart festivalDramatic Highland hills, towering trees and endless Scottish skies are just part of the appeal of Tartan Heart, hosted at the Belladrum Estate west of Inverness. The 2022 theme of “myths and legends” should make this much-loved and fiercely independent fest feel even more transportive, helped by an eclectic musical guest list that includes Nile Rodgers, Emeli Sandé and Passenger alongside some of the best traditional folk musicians in the country.28 to 30 July, Belladrum, nr Inverness Kendal CallingMounting your event in the Lake District feels like a cheat code for accessing natural beauty, but the bucolic Kendal Calling has always done things a little differently (such as offering Tim Burgess the use of a log cabin to make his Tim Peaks Diner concept a reality). Pandemic interference meant that the festival missed its official 15th anniversary in 2020 but the 2022 edition seems determined to make up for it.28 to 31 July, Lowther Deer Park, nr Penrith Valley FestTaking place on the banks of Chew Valley Lake nine miles south of Bristol, this boutique-sized celebration of music and local food – hosted by a friendly farmer who likes to joke “get on my land” – offers an easygoing vibe and wondrous views of the limestone Mendip Hills, officially an area of outstanding natural beauty. Highlights on the Lake Stage include Clean Bandit, Travis and the Dolly Show, the UK’s best Dolly Parton impersonator.4 to 7 August, Chew Magna, nr Bristol BoardmastersSurf culture is at the heart of Newquay’s bodacious Boardmasters festival, a five-day hybrid event that boasts its own beach. While hanging out at the laid-back surf and skate village that sprouts up on Fistral Beach is appealing, the main Watergate Bay site also provides a striking backdrop for musical guests. Kings of Leon, Disclosure and Damian Marley are among the artists hoping to make waves this year.10 to 14 August, Watergate Bay & Fistral Beach, NewquayGV",Arts/Music,Field of dreams: the best music festivals still available to book,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/02/field-of-dreams-the-best-music-festivals-still-available-to-book
4/2/2022,"Inside my head the war is everywhere,” writes the Vietnamese-American author Ocean Vuong in a line from his new poetry collection Time Is a Mother. “I hate to say it, but this is normal,” Vuong says from New York, when we speak during the early weeks of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in March. “Displacement and refugees crossing borders, mothers and fathers dragging their children along, these heartbreaking scenes, this is normal for our species.” As he tells his students at NYU, where he is a visiting professor: “If you want to study literature, study war. For as long as there are soldiers there are poets.” To say that Vuong is a poet born of war is not merely a figure of speech. “An American soldier fucked a Vietnamese farmgirl. Thus my mother exists. Thus I exist,” as he puts it in one of his poems. He was born on a rice farm outside Saigon, but after more than a year in a refugee camp in the Philippines his mother fled to America when he was two. His novel On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, which stretches from the paddy fields of Vietnam to the tobacco farms of New England, from napalm attacks to the opioid crisis in the US, is his account of growing up “a queer Asian American poor kid” in the aftermath of 9/11. It is written as a letter to his mother, who couldn’t read. Vuong himself couldn’t read until he was 11. But before he was 30, his first collection, Night Sky With Exit Wounds, had made him the starriest of a new generation of poets; critics compared him to Emily Dickinson and Gerard Manley Hopkins; and he won several major prizes and a MacArthur Foundation “genius grant”. “You’re so / lucky. You’re gay plus you get to write about war and stuff,” whined a white student in his creative writing class, recounted in one of the new poems. “I got nothing.” Now 33, Vuong is “5ft 4in tall, 112 lbs”, as he writes in On Earth. “I am handsome at exactly three angles and deadly from everywhere else.” All sunken cheeks and angular lines, there is something otherworldly about him (he doesn’t drive, has never used Uber, and Instagram is the only App on his phone). His voice is as gentle as the wind chimes in his poem Someday I’ll Love Ocean Vuong – listen to him read it and you will love Ocean Vuong a little bit too. Frankly, he had me with the title On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous, a novel of rare tenderness and lyricism. He is also a Zen Buddhist. “It’s kind of like anything else,” he says. “Sometimes I’m terrible, sometimes I’m good, but you always try to be the best you can.” Behind him on the sofa in a spare, all-white New York rented studio, his shih tzu poodle, Tofu, as white as his surroundings, is doing his best to distract us from the seriousness of our conversation. An ex-police dog, even he has a background of violence, Vuong says. Tofu is joined by puppy Rosie, the youngest addition to the household, whom Vuong and his partner, Peter, got during lockdown. Peter, a lawyer, is a Lithuanian-Polish Jew, whose grandmother, the prose poem Nothing in the new collection tells us, narrowly escaped Auschwitz. They are all descendants of trauma. Time Is a Mother is Vuong’s first book to be published since the death of his mother, Rose, in 2019. She died aged 51, almost certainly, he believes, from the toxic chemicals to which she was exposed through years spent working in nail salons. His poem Amazon History of a Former Nail Salon Worker (inspired by William Carlos Williams’s credo “no ideas but in things”) itemises purchases from painkillers and Tampax, to a chemo headscarf and eventually an urn, recording the last months of her life with devastating economy. “I would never have been able to do that 10 years ago,” he says. “It takes a lot of confidence that you have to just earn as a writer, to let the objects speak for themselves.” He is a very slow worker, he says – Exit Wounds took eight years, On Earth five. For Time Is a Mother, he had already written most of the poems before her death. But when he looked back he realised how many dealt with loss: “Oh my goodness, I have been grieving for most of my life,” he says. “Whether it’s friends, it’s family, it’s collective grieving. I think most of us are grieving in some way, and the poem becomes a site where we can meet each other in that grief.” His mother was able to enjoy some of his success: even though she didn’t understand what was being said, she would come to his readings and sit facing the audience so she could see how they responded. The collection’s twin poles are loss and addiction. As a teenager in bleak post-industrial Connecticut, Vuong saw many of his friends die – “little dots erased off the map” – as a result of the opioid epidemic. “We didn’t call it an epidemic,” he says of the early 2000s, when even his teachers were dying of drugs, without being given a funeral. “It was so shameful. How could a teacher be a junkie?” As his family’s great hope, Vuong was determined not to suffer the same fate. “I refuse to die,” he writes of his younger self in On Earth. While he might not have been shooting up heroin like some of his friends, he was addicted “to everything you could crush into a white powder and sprinkle over a blunt”, he admits now. In 2012, he spent two weeks in a government-funded clinic, hinted at in details in the new poems: “the McDonald’s arch, glimpsed from the 2am rehab / window”. He wanted “to express what it is really like living with addiction and recovering”. For him, addiction is “one of the most human things. It is the body and the mind deciding to find a way out. We have this desire to be OK, to feel better and that amplifies the horror all around us.” Writing poetry taught him how to write an autobiographical novel. Part autofiction, part epistolary novel, part prose poem, On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous is Vuong’s attempt to write the American coming-of-age story as a gay refugee. “Now that it is my turn, how do I take this project of questing towards identity forwards?” he asks. Instead of a journey towards self-improvement and discovery, the novel follows the east Asian narrative structure of kishōtenkets: no dramatic peak; no victims or villains; and, crucially for Vuong, no escape to another place. “These folks find joy where they are. That was so precious to me.” The novel comprises two love stories, both heartbreaking: the first between a mother and her son, known only as Little Dog; the second between Little Dog and a white teenager called Trevor. He wanted to write a book about “rural queerness”, in which “fleeing to the metropolis was not the final act. There’s a lot of suspicion and doubt about that, the metropolis being the only place we can go. Some of us can’t afford to go there,” he says. “I wanted to keep these two boys in the rural space so that they are protecting a tiny flame between each other, with no models.” Despite this intimacy, Vuong is clear that On Earth is not autobiography: he has a brother 10 years younger than him, for a start, but to include him would have detracted from the intensity between the mother and son. He follows Emily Dickinson’s maxim: “Tell all the truth but tell it slant.” Vuong is not Little Dog: “He is much better than I am. He got 12 drafts. Ocean gets one draft and he often fucks up.” But this is his world: he looks for outliers and outcasts, like Trevor (“a composite” of many boys Vuong knew growing up), and places them centre stage, “because that’s who I am. I come from the working class. You rarely see these lives amplified and rendered with dignity.” The cliche of being “saved by books” is true in his case. He remembers entering a library one afternoon when he was 15. “I didn’t see anybody that I knew in there. It felt immediately like trespassing.” But he started pulling books about Buddhism off the shelf, “because I needed medicine,” he says. “It was like: ‘Welcome to suffering! You’ve already been in it, so here are some remedies to find a way.’” The library became his refuge, and he was soon transported by all the other titles he found there. “Queer imagination comes out of the need to escape, to create something safe,” he says. Today, he still roams across the canon, picking and choosing whatever he can to refashion into something new. “Why shouldn’t you use it all?” he asks. “As an outsider I had that freedom to go back into the junkyard and say: ‘Just because white men were finished with these tools doesn’t mean they are garbage to me, I’m going to reuse them.’” He is suspicious of the minimalist, macho aesthetics laid down by Ernest Hemingway and Raymond Carver, preferring the Romantics with their big ideas and unrestrained lyricism. “For me it is like performing literary drag. I’ve returned to the 19th century, taken the subordinate clause and reused it to over-exertion with earnestness.” Moby-Dick is the unlikely model for On Earth: he was drawn to the scale of Herman Melville’s ambition and his fondness for essayistic detours. “To me that was actually quite queer. No subject is off limits.” Like novelist Marilynne Robinson, Vuong is unafraid of moral seriousness (the adjective “earnest” crops up often in reviews). This sincerity is perhaps one reason why he appeals so strongly to a youthful audience. “Young people want to be spoken to directly. They want to speak to each other directly,” he says of the recent poetry revival. “When we are in trouble collectively we don’t want context and plot. A poem makes the most sense because there is no fluff. It goes right in and gets to what we are all feeling. I think young people especially are so tired of these contexts and these frames.” He has no time for the irony or cynicism that have become bywords for contemporary American fiction. He doesn’t hang out with other writers, because it inevitably leads to gossip “and that withers my soul”. For him this “Brooklyn fear of feeling” is a limitation of white masculinity. “You can only say ‘this sucks’ for so long, before it becomes lazy,” he says. “A lot of men have been saying that for a long time. OK, we get it. It sucks. So now what?” This is a question he always asks himself as a writer. He is at his best “when the world has kind of knocked me down and I’ve decided, maybe after weeping in the dark, finally to get up off the ground and ask – now what?” Despite having more than his share of anger and sadness to draw on, he is at his most creative in their aftermath. “When I get off of the floor, metaphorically – the anger has come and gone, the sadness has come and gone – and I say: ‘What do I do with it?’ Sometimes we just go and make dinner, we go and do the dishes, and sometimes we start to write.” Writing still feels “like stealing time” for him. He often writes at night, a habit from his days working in cafes as an undergraduate; parts of On Earth were written – literally – in a closet, as it was the quietest place he could find. He always writes the first draft in longhand because it takes 10 or 15 seconds longer to finish a sentence. “If you multiply this through the space of a book you spend hours more inside your book than you would have writing on the computer,” he explains, holding up his notebook with neat handwritten pages. “Halfway through that sentence something is revealed to you. It is an act of sustained meditation.” Having spent so long immersed in what he calls his “parallel universe”, he is looking forward to going “back into the world to see what the air is like”. He and Peter are in the early stages of considering adoption: “I was like, let me finish one more book.” Time Is a Mother is his most “complete” book, he says, the one of which he is most proud in terms of craft. “There’s always a bit of shame involved at this juncture. And it hasn’t happened this time.” Tofu pads towards the door like a big cotton ball. “But even if people love your books, what comes out in publication is only close to what you had in your imagination, if you are really lucky,” Vuong says. “And I think that is such a beautiful thing. To be a writer is to traffic in failure.”  Time Is a Mother is published by Jonathan Cape. To support The Guardian and Observer, order your copy at guardianbookshop.com.

4/2/2022,"For talks that are meant to be about halting the mass extinction of life on Earth, the slow pace of negotiations in Geneva ahead of Cop15, the major biodiversity summit in Kunming, China, later this year, was not a hopeful sign that meaningful action would follow. As discussions drew to a close this week, little progress was made on the targets and goals that are meant to herald nature’s “Paris moment”. Rhetoric from rich developed nations about the need for ambition on halting biodiversity loss was not being followed through with resources, negotiators from Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa complained. Once again, much was being asked of the developing world without financial help to enact the change deemed necessary by nations that long ago cleared their forests, drained their wetlands and polluted their rivers to industrialise. Governments have never met their own targets on halting the destruction of ecosystems despite bleak scientific warnings about species extinctions and the consequences for humans. But many world leaders suggested that this decade’s global biodiversity framework would be different, acknowledging scientists’ warning that humanity must solve the climate and nature crises together or solve neither. Last September, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, told a conservation summit in Marseille that there was “no vaccine for a sick planet”. The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told last year’s Davos summit that the world needed a Paris agreement for nature. The UK put forests and wetlands at the heart of its Cop26 presidency in Glasgow, signing up to the leaders’ pledge for nature in September 2020 as part of “meaningful action” on nature. But rich countries’ failure to provide at least $100bn a year of climate finance to the developing world at Cop26 in Glasgow has undermined trust and that is spilling over into the biodiversity process. In the final plenary session in Geneva on Tuesday, Gabon – speaking on behalf of the Africa group, Brazil, India and other developing countries, also supported by China – called for developed countries to commit to providing $100bn (£76bn) a year of biodiversity finance from public and provide sources, which would rise to $700bn by 2030, closing the “nature funding gap”. Gabon’s representative said: “This must be new, additional and separate to the financing that has been committed under the UNFCCC and the Paris agreement. The current architecture for global biodiversity financing should be transformed.” The 2010 Aichi targets, agreed in Japan in the wake of the global financial crisis, failed partly because of a lack of resources for the agreement, say experts. This time, Covid-19, rising inflation and the war in Ukraine are all significant impediments to more money for nature, even if more than half of global GDP relies on high-functioning biodiversity. One African negotiator said: “To get out of this standoff between developing and developed countries, we need something transformative but it’s not going to be like the climate. “Developing countries will just not compromise their sovereignty over their trees, soils, people and right to develop to the same extent that they would be willing to do for climate change,” they said. The final plenary session also saw a lengthy standoff over biopiracy, which some fear could scupper the entire agreement, as developing countries demand they are paid for drug discoveries and other commercial products based on their biodiversity. This, along with targets on money, protected areas, restoration, pesticides and plastics, will be discussed at an extra meeting in Nairobi in June ahead of Cop15 in Kunming. Then, it will be up to governments whether or not to back their rhetoric with action at the summit. Progress … at lastAfter months of Zoom meetings and false starts, Geneva provided the moment when negotiators met for talks in person for the first time since March 2020. There was much to disagree about but time spent together – as well as drinking and eating in the Geneva sun – helped bring back some momentum to the process. Small steps towards Cop15 were finally taken. Governments agree negotiating textAt the beginning of the talks in mid-March, negotiators could have thrown out the entire draft text and disputed the targets and goals that will make up this decade’s global biodiversity framework. That did not happen. While delegates left Geneva with much of the text in brackets, governments have agreed a stable negotiating text. It will include targets on subsidies, protected areas and invasive species. The ambition is now up to negotiators. Business demands moreWhile the role of big business in a UN environmental process should often be treated with scepticism, the Business for Nature coalition played an active role in negotiations, with companies such as H&M urging governments to agree a target for mandatory nature-related disclosures for companies. If this is going to be a transformational moment for nature, all parts of society need to sign up, including businesses small and large. Will Cop15 in Kunming ever happen?With Cop15 due to be staged in Kunming, China has the presidency for a major international environmental conference for the first time. Yet despite assurances from the UN that the summit would take place in late August, Beijing has still not told countries when Cop15 is happening, how they will get there and how their zero-Covid policy might affect the summit. Rumours of charter flights and a Winter Olympics-style bubble were widespread in Geneva, but only the Chinese presidency really knows what is going on. Ambition and action remain miles apartAhead of the final weekend, WWF, the RSPB and other leading conservation organisations warned that “nowhere near enough progress is being made” in a joint statement, highlighting a “yawning gap” between the draft deal and the bleak picture described by the science. Most scientists agree that humanity is driving the sixth mass extinction of life on Earth, the worst loss of life on the planet since the time of the dinosaurs. Yet the political energy expended on biodiversity negotiations is still lacking, and still overshadowed by climate talks. Risk of a biodiversity ‘Copenhagen moment’ risesWhile a complete collapse in talks remains unlikely, the spectre of a biodiversity “Copenhagen moment” – a reference to when 2009 climate talks in the Danish capital collapsed – in Kunming is lurking. There is major disagreement over money and the use of digital sequence information (DSI) of genetic biodiversity, known as biopiracy. Negotiators and the Chinese government will need to work hard in the coming months to avoid a disastrous scenario where no final agreement on the text can be reached.

4/2/2022,"Prof John Duggan*, a climate scientist at a Russell Group university, had a Zoom call a few weeks ago with two Russian research partners shortly after their country invaded Ukraine. Duggan, who has worked with the academics for a while, suddenly found them “unusually quiet and hesitant”. He sensed that “they were worried someone was looking over their shoulder”. In Russia, expressing opposition to the invasion is risky. But in subsequent calls Duggan says his friends have become bolder. Now they have given up hope for their work at home. They feel there is “no future for science in Russia” and are seeking positions abroad so they can flee. Given that criticising the war can now lead to 15 years in prison in Russia, Duggan describes all communications with the scientists he is trying to help as deliberately “ambiguous”. But he says: “They feel shame at what is being done in their name in Ukraine.” UK academics say this is becoming a familiar story. Russian scientists are turning to partners abroad to help them escape, but academics in the UK say even the most talented may struggle to find positions at short notice in British universities. Last Sunday, the science minister, George Freeman, announced that the UK would follow other European countries in cutting the bulk of its research ties with Russia and switching off funding for any research with links to the state and its “institutional collaborators”. The Russian government last week prohibited its scientists from taking part in international conferences or publishing research in international journals. Russian scientists say there is some appetite to ignore this, but there are reports that they are being blocked from publishing abroad anyway because some western academics are refusing to review research papers with Russian names on. Duggan’s university, which the Guardian is not naming in order to avoid risk to the Russian academics, is making sanctuary for Ukrainian scholars and students its top priority, along with supporting staff and students already affected by the war. The university is also exploring whether it could offer positions to any Russians. Duggan says: “The university is keen to be as supportive as possible. It will work within government guidelines, but recognises that many individual Russian academics and researchers have publicly criticised this invasion, often at great personal risk.” Science is considered a global endeavour with researchers partnering up with colleagues all over the world. Now many in Russia feel their work, shut off from international collaborations, will wither. Dr Alexander Nozik, a physicist at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, told the Guardian: “I believe and most of my colleagues believe that it just isn’t possible to do isolated science. In physics the science journal system in Russia is mostly dead.” Nozik says “most younger academics, including me” are talking to contacts in Europe and formulating a “backup plan”. He adds: “A lot of world-class scientists I know here can’t work on their research because they are so depressed. They can’t understand how we can live with all this.” Nozik says he intends to ignore the government statement banning publishing in international journals and many colleagues will follow suit. But he adds that researchers there are “complaining a lot that academics [in the west] are blocking [journal] papers by refusing to review them if they have a Russian collaborator”. Prof Erica Brewer*, an environmental scientist at a northern research university in the UK, fears for the safety of research partners in Russia who are speaking out against the war. “I have received requests from two very talented Russian colleagues asking if I know of opportunities to work abroad,” she says. “A colleague and I have put out feelers for them but it is currently not possible to find a place for them in the UK or Europe.” Dr James Ryan, a senior lecturer in modern Russian history at Cardiff University, says: “I’ve been in contact with academic friends in Russia. Some of them have already fled, and have no intention of returning any time soon. That’s the situation with many more.” However, he says, while some Russian academics may be able to use their reputations and academic contacts to secure short term research funding at European universities, finding longer-term jobs in the fiercely competitive academic job market will be much harder. His own work is affected. Before the invasion Ryan relied on using libraries and archives in Russia for his research, but now he has no idea when he will be able to go back there. Thousands of academics in Russia have signed open letters condemning the war. Last Friday, Russia’s ministry of justice declared the popular Russian science newspaper Troitsky Variant “a foreign agent” following its publication of a letter by scientists and science journalists opposing the invasion that was signed by about 8,000 people. The paper’s website is now blocked in Russia. The majority of Russian universities are run by the state and last month the Russian rectors’ union, representing nearly 700 university chancellors and presidents, horrified British universities by issuing a statement echoing Vladimir Putin’s propaganda on the “denazification” of Ukraine and supporting “our president who … made the most difficult, hard-won but necessary decision in his life”. Ryan says that after this, “it would be ethically problematic to seek a formal invitation from a Russian institution [to do research there]”. He firmly supports the British government’s decision to cut formal ties with Russian higher education institutions, but intends to maintain informal personal connections with colleagues in Russia. Last week, as an “act of solidarity”, he attended an online conference with mostly Russian historians who he says “were certainly not supportive of the Russian war”. He adds: “I would be horrified if academics are refusing to review papers written or co-written by Russians. This is racism.” Terry Callaghan, a professor of Arctic ecology at Sheffield University, says: “We have very strong collaborations with Russian scientists and the invasion is a huge blow to our work.” Callaghan has helped establish 89 environmental research stations in the Arctic, 21 of which are in Russia, but says “lots of our research is now frozen because of the invasion”. “I’m absolutely sure many scientists will leave Russia. Putin has divided the nation, but scientists tend to speak English and they also read the internet so they understand what is really happening in Ukraine.” Callaghan paused his professorship at the National Research Tomsk State University in Siberia after the Russian rectors’ statement. He says he has halted all formal commitments with Russia but will not abandon personal connections with scientists that he has been fostering for 30 years. However, he says this is more difficult to do in other places where he conducts research. “In Finland we are not allowed even to email a Russian, and where I am now [in Arctic Norway] we can’t have a Russian on a Zoom call.” Individual academics in Russia are still welcome to attend the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies’ annual conference in Cambridge next weekend, albeit not representing their institutions. Dr Ben Phillips, a historian of modern Russian at Exeter University and a member of the society’s executive committee, says: “We discussed whether we should exclude Russian participants but decided against it.” He says that instead the conference, which will feature a keynote address from a Ukrainian academic, will have a “strict code of conduct” and panel chairs will ask anyone who expresses support for the invasion of Ukraine to leave. But he adds: “Anyone harassing Russian academics on account of their nationality will be treated the same way.” * Some names have been changed to avoid identifying academics who are trying to leave Russia.",News/World news,‘No hope for science in Russia’: the academics trying to flee to the west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/02/no-hope-science-russia-academics-trying-flee-to-west
4/2/2022,"Do you remember that speech in Shakespeare’s The Tempest when Prospero’s slave, Ariel, reports back to his master with an account of all the work he’s done to capsize the king’s ship? He says he boarded the ship and “flamed amazement”. One moment he was on the deck, the next in every cabin, then up on the topmast and then on the bowsprit, creating “sulphurous roaring” and causing people to jump into the sea. It made me think of you. There I was last week, hearing you presenting all your big new ideas on the radio and on TV. You were firing off in all directions. I hope you’ll excuse me if I express some scepticism about your schools white paper. You see, people like me who’ve been parents and education-watchers for nearly 50 years don’t whoop with joy when a new secretary of state for education comes on the scene with yet another Great Big Bag of Big Ideas that will – of course – drive standards up, narrow the attainment gap, give parents what they want, deal with bad behaviour, give everyone a job, level up, simplify the types of schools, and give help to those pupils falling behind. For most of those 50 years it’s your party that’s been in power. If you think education needs shaking up that’s because you’re dealing with the last time you guys shook it up. Or the time before that. Or the time before that. What did Kenneth Baker or Michael Gove do that didn’t do the trick? Or what knack or streak of genius have you got that those two giants of education theory and practice didn’t have? I wonder, for example, if you remember Gove-worship? It worked like this: Gove would announce another great education reform – the “knowledge-rich curriculum” or “world-class GCSEs” or, of course “academies and free schools”. Your side of the Commons drooled with delight. Sympathetic newspapers wrote about the great revolution that Gove was bringing about. Then, when the great man suddenly left office, his admiring colleagues explained how Gove had turned schools round, driven up standards, and broken the stranglehold the local authority mafia had over education. Job done, surely? But no. It seems even after 11 years of Tory-led education we still apparently need Ariel Zahawi to hurl yet more of Jove’s lightning around. So I have to confess bewilderment. How about you do another speech next week in which you explain to us parents what it was that your predecessors got wrong that you’re now having to put right? Yet your Great Big Bag of Big Ideas feels uncannily empty. Apart from the mind-numbingly ordinary stuff about the hours in a school week, one of your Big Ideas caught my eye. Announcing that all schools are to join multi-academy trusts, you said: “All the evidence suggests that schools that work together in a family of schools … deliver better outcomes for the children.” I don’t expect you to be a scholar of education history – though it would be nice – but have you heard of someone called Sir Tim Brighouse? He led something called the London Challenge (2002-07, when I had several children in London schools). Do you know what Brighouse put in place? Schools working together. It was a huge success and teachers are still talking about it. Brighouse would have been just the man to advise on a national rollout of the scheme. It wasn’t to be. Instead, the preferred Tory model for schools, as enacted by Gove, was for them to compete with each other for pupils, teachers and facilities through the vicious instrument of league tables. The huge apparatus of assessment, which could and should have been designed to help students, is instead tied into proving that one school is better than another. And yet, it is precisely this model that you are sticking with: demanding yet more academies, praising grammar schools – thereby depriving neighbouring schools of academically high-achieving students. And yet you roar out praise for families of schools. One thing that can be said for certainty is that within a few years, someone sitting in your seat will give the same speech as you, using the same cliches. “Narrow the attainment gap … good standards … bad behaviour … blah blah blah … passionate about education … I went to school, you know … I want every school to be a grammar school … levelling up … blah blah blah …” When is an education secretary going to find out what really needs to be done?
