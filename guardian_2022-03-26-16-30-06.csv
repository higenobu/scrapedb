3/26/2022,"“Sue-thy-neighbour” laws that ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy in Texas and now Idaho. A “don’t say gay” bill censoring discussion of sexual orientation in schools in Florida. A ban on Maus, a graphic novel about the Holocaust, by a school board in Tennessee. America’s national government might be under Democratic control but its red states are on the march with sweeping laws targeting abortion, LGBTQ+ people and the teaching of race in schools that threaten to turn back the clock to an era when a citizen’s rights depended on where they lived. The offensive on cultural hot button issues also appears calculated to ensure that November’s midterm elections will be contested on a playing field of rightwing outrage. Democrats argue that Republicans resort to such territory in lieu of policy substance. “There’s no serious agenda on the Republican side,” said Donna Brazile, a former acting chairperson of the Democratic National Committee. “It’s the same choir that had the same anthem from the 60s through the last election cycle. Without an agenda, without a leader, without a way forward, you have to rely on the old hits. It’s no longer on vinyl; it’s digital.” Although President Donald Trump lost the White House and Republicans lost both chambers of Congress in 2020, Trumpism is thriving in the 30 states where Republicans have legislative control. Under Trump’s continued influence, they are exploiting wedge issues as never before. Last year seven states imposed new restrictions on abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, the biggest such wave of legislation since the supreme court’s landmark Roe v Wade decision in 1973. A law in Texas bans abortion after a doctor detects an embryonic heartbeat – usually around six weeks – and allows private citizens to sue clinics, doctors and anyone else accused of helping provide such abortions in the state. In the month after it took effect the number of abortions reported in Texas fell by 60%, with many women travelling to neighbouring states. Deep red Idaho this week passed a similar measure, a six-week restriction again relying on private citizens to enforce the law. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said: “We’re right back in the Soviet era with neighbours and family members snitching on neighbours and family members. That’s unbelievable.” Missouri, Oklahoma and Tennessee are considering similar proposals, while earlier this month Florida’s Republican-led legislature sent a 15-week abortion ban to Governor Ron DeSantis for signature. Republican state legislatures have also launched what the Human Rights Campaign, America’s biggest LGBTQ advocacy group, describes as the worst attack on LGBTQ+ rights in decades. A record of more than 300 anti-LGBTQ+ bills have been introduced this year, it says, with 130-plus specifically targeting transgender people. The HRC describes the legislation as part of a coordinated effort by powerful interests promoted by rightwing entities such as the Heritage Foundation. “These groups peddle in fear and pit people against each other to marginalize and punish LGBTQ+ people – and especially transgender children.” Among the most egregious examples is Florida legislation dubbed “don’t say gay” that would bar instruction on “sexual orientation or gender identity” in schools from kindergarten through grade 3. Its dog-whistling impulse was evident when Christina Pushaw, press secretary for DeSantis, tweeted: “The bill that liberals inaccurately call ‘don’t say gay’ would be more accurately described as an anti-grooming bill.” Cathryn Oakley, state legislative director and senior counsel for the Human Rights Campaign, said: “We’re looking at one of the worst legislative sessions for LGBTQ issues ever in terms of volume of bills introduced.” “Almost all of them are targeting transgender youth, whether that’s through bans on trans students being able to play school sports consistent with their gender identity, bans on trans youth being able to access gender-affirming medical care, bans on trans students being able to use the correct restroom in school.” Oakley added: “The ‘don’t say gay or trans’ bill lives at the intersection of this huge effort to attack LGBTQ but particularly trans youth and the movement that we’ve seen resurrected in the recent years that’s about surveilling teachers and censoring curriculum, whether that’s talking about critical race theory, about what’s in the sex ed class or about banning books.” In Tennessee, the McMinn county school board removed Maus, a Pulitzer prize-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust, from its curriculum because of “inappropriate language” and an illustration of a nude woman (actually a cartoon mouse). The state’s governor, Bill Lee, then proposed a law for closer scrutiny of school libraries so students consume “age appropriate” content. Tennessee also banned the teaching of a critical race theory (CRT), an academic discipline that examines how racism becomes embedded in legal systems but has been caricatured by Republicans as a divisive anti-white ideology. Eight other Republican-led states – Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Arizona and North Dakota – had also passed legislation against the teaching of CRT as of last November, according to the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington, with nearly 20 states introducing or planning to introduce similar legislation. Brookings also noted that the conservative Fox News channel had mentioned “critical race theory” 1,300 times in less than four months. CRT was a frequently cited bogeyman at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, Florida, which was themed “Awake not woke” – a sure sign of its potential to energise and rile up the base for electoral purposes. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow at Brookings and former Bill Clinton administration official, said: “There were some very good things about the old Republican party. Now it’s a party of racists and homophobes and people pursuing bizarre cultural things. It’s just crazy. “They’re a bankrupt party and yet they manage to do well on these kinds of issues because people get emotional about them and don’t really understand or in fact care about the economic issues. Democrats have been tone deaf thinking that the economic issues will always trump the cultural issues. They don’t.” For Republicans, this week’s Senate judiciary committee hearing for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson seemed to be as much as about campaigning for the 2022 midterms, which will decide control of the House of Representatives and Senate, as the first Black woman nominated to the supreme court. Dwelling on CRT, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas held up the book Antiracist Baby by Ibram X Kendi and demanded: “Do you agree… that babies are racist?” Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee asked: “Can you provide a definition for the word ‘woman’?” Jackson replied: “I can’t … I’m not a biologist.” Tara Setmayer, a senior adviser to the anti-Trump group Lincoln Project, said: “The Scotus [supreme court] nomination hearings this week were a window into the Republican party’s strategy going into midterms and 2024. They have no policy agenda. They are strictly focused on culture war wedge issues because they’ve had success energising their base with them and the people who are leading the charge are fundamentally unserious people. “Senator Mitch McConnell has already said that he’s not releasing a policy agenda. There’s a reason for that. Culture war politics can work and Democrats run the risk of underestimating how powerful and energising this tactic of politicking can be. They underestimate it at their own peril.” What links many hot button issues is children. Whether unborn or at school, they are portrayed by Republicans as vulnerable to sinister forces aligned with Democrats and leftwing militants. Glenn Youngkin, the governor of Virginia, set up a tip line so parents could send “reports and observations” about perceived objectionable conduct by teachers and school staff. The appeal to parental instincts rather than to policy judgments was accelerated by frustrations over mask mandates and school closures during the coronavirus pandemic. Setmayer, a political commentator and former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “Some of the issues speak to the fundamental desire to protect your children. There’s a reason why Republicans for decades have always included getting involved at the school board level as part of their grassroots playbook. “Any time you frame a political issue around children, you can activate voters who may not have been activated before because they want to make sure that their children are safe. It becomes a more righteous issue; it’s not just about them in their minds.” Not all Republicans are on board. This week Indiana’s governor, Eric Holcomb, and Governor Spencer Cox of Utah vetoed legislation that would bar transgender girls from taking part in girls’ sports at school. But such voices remain in the minority, with the Trump-dominated party only likely to become more aggressive on hot button issues as the polls draw closer. Monika McDermott, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, said: “At this point Democrats are in some ways dismissing it as well as though they think people will see through it and I think that’s a big mistake. “They need to fight this head on, counter these arguments, make things clear, try to redefine things like so-called critical race theory and explain the reasons why they support teaching this kind of historical perspective in schools and why it’s necessary, and why abortion has been legal for so long and what’s happening to it now.” She added: “They need to do the same kind of call to arms that Republicans are doing but on the liberal side, and I don’t see them doing that at this point. I see them resting on their laurels to a certain extent, targeting specific districts. It’s all about strategy but they’re not getting at the heart of the matter.”",News/US news,"Republicans’ midterms pitch: never mind the policy, here’s the culture war",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/republicans-midterms-culture-war-lgbtq-abortion-book-bans

3/26/2022,"Members of the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack are weighing whether to demand that Ginni Thomas, the wife of the supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, cooperate with the inquiry, according to two sources familiar with the matter. A move to request cooperation from Ginni Thomas, who was revealed to have pushed in text messages to Trump’s former chief of staff Mark Meadows to overturn the results of the 2020 election, would mark one of the most aggressive steps taken by the panel. In private deliberations on Friday, several members on the select committee discussed among themselves whether the panel should ask Thomas to voluntarily appear before the panel or compel documents and testimony through a subpoena, the sources said. The members also discussed the scope of any formal cooperation request, and whether any information that Thomas might be willing to provide would actually help the select committee understand whether January 6 was a criminal conspiracy, the sources said. At least some of the hesitation in demanding cooperation from Thomas appeared to centre on concerns that she might have no intention of assisting the panel and could seek to create a spectacle that could distract from the investigation, the sources said. Thomas, for instance, remains a close friend of prominent rightwing political operatives including Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon, who last year openly defied a subpoena as he sought to undermine the legitimacy of the select committee. A spokesperson for the panel declined to comment. But some of the members are planning to huddle and discuss the matter in person ahead of a business meeting on Monday to hold the Trump aides Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro in contempt of Congress, the sources said. Thomas is facing heightened scrutiny for working as a Republican activist while her husband sits on the supreme court after the Washington Post and CBS reported that she pushed Trump’s most senior White House aide to overturn the 2020 election results. In one of 29 text messages from Ginni Thomas that Meadows turned over to the select committee, Thomas also pressured the former White House chief of staff to have Trump appoint the conspiracy theorist and lawyer Sidney Powell to lead his post-election legal team. The communications are significant as they represent the first evidence that she was advising the White House on how to return Trump to office by any means, while her husband ruled on cases attempting to change the outcome of the election. But Meadows did not turn over any text messages between 24 November and 10 January, the Washington Post and CBS reported – a gap in communications that overlaps with the Capitol attack and would almost certainly be an area of interest to the panel.",News/US news,House January 6 panel members weigh seeking cooperation from Ginni Thomas,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/ginni-thomas-house-january-6-committee

3/26/2022,"The confirmation hearings of Ketanji Brown Jackson officially wrapped up this week after four days of extensive questioning, heated exchanges and other contentious moments. But Jackson, who was questioned by Republican senators on a variety of issues, was widely praised for her patient demeanor and thoughtful responses. With the hearings finally done, here are some of the best moments from Jackson’s hearing. In her opening remarks, Jackson gave several shoutouts to her family, sharing gratitude and love for their support throughout her extensive law career. Several members of her family were present for the almost 22 hours of questioning she faced. Her husband, Patrick Jackson, and her two daughters, Leila and Talia, sat in the audience as she fielded questions from the Senate judiciary committee. Of her husband of 25 years, she said: “I have no doubt that, without him by my side from the very beginning of this incredible professional journey, none of this would have been possible.” She also spoke to her two daughters about the challenges of balancing work responsibilities with raising children. “Girls, I know it has not been easy as I have tried to navigate the challenges of juggling my career and motherhood. And I fully admit that I did not always get the balance right. But I hope that you have seen that with hard work, determination, and love, it can be done,” said Jackson. Her parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown, and younger brother, Ketajh Brown, were also present. “My parents taught me that, unlike the many barriers that they had to face growing up, my path was clearer, such that if I worked hard and believed in myself, in America I could do anything or be anything I wanted to be,” she said. She gave a special mention to her father, whom she credited as being her inspiration for entering law. “My very earliest memories are of watching my father study – he had his stack of law books on the kitchen table while I sat across from him with my stack of coloring books,” said Jackson. Johnny and Ellery Brown, who have been married for 54 years, were both raised in the Jim Crow south. After attending historically Black colleges and universities, they moved to Washington DC and worked as public school teachers. Ketajh Brown, who is 10 years younger than Ketanji, graduated from Howard University and worked in the Baltimore City police department as an undercover narcotics recovery officer. Ketajh joined the Maryland army national guard after 9/11, and later followed in his sister’s footsteps, also pursuing a career in law. Ketajh now works as an associate at the law firm K&L Gates in Chicago. Lisa Fairfax, professor and co-director at the Institute for Law and Economics at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, gave a heartfelt introduction of Jackson on the first day of confirmation hearings. Fairfax, who was Jackson’s former roommate at Harvard University, shared personal stories of their friendship, including details of Jackson’s personality that were a touching highlight. “There’s so much more to Ketanji beyond her brilliant mind. There’s her wonderful sense of humor, her gift of storytelling, her heart of gold that always shows up, from the first call you make for advice about your career to the first knock you hear on the door after learning you’re diagnosed with cancer,” said Fairfax. “You never have to ask; she is always there. Above all, Ketanji is humble enough not to pretend she knows how to have it all, but she does know how to give it her all. And what she gives to her family, her friends, she also gives to the law and to this country,” added Fairfax. On the third day of confirmation hearings, Jackson was asked by the California senator Alex Padilla about advice she would give to youth of color who may be doubting themselves. “What would you say, Judge Jackson, to all those young Americans, those most diverse generation in our nation’s history – what do you say to some of them who may doubt that they can one day achieve the same great heights that you have?” asked Padilla. “The young people are the future and I want them to know that they can do and be anything,” responded Jackson, with emotion. To underscore her point, she shared a story about feeling out of place as a freshman at Harvard, saying she felt very homesick. “I was really questioning: do I belong here? Can I make it in this environment?” recalled Jackson. But then, she said, a Black woman whom she didn’t known approached her and told Jackson to “persevere”. So, Jackson said: “I would tell them to persevere.” In a widely shared clip, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey praised Jackson and her performance during the confirmation hearings, bringing the judge to tears as Booker declaimed that she had well earned her supreme court nomination. Booker started by calling out the problematic line of questioning of some GOP senators, specifically about Jackson’s sentencing in child sexual abuse cases. Booker pointed to a column from the right-leaning National Review that trashed the Republican senator Josh Hawley’s allegations that Jackson had been lenient as “meritless to the point of demagoguery”. “There is an absurdity to this that is almost comical if it was not so dangerous,” said Booker. He went on to name Jackson’s wide range of achievements, including balancing parenting responsibilities while working as a lawyer in private practice, and getting bipartisan support for her appointment to the DC circuit’s court of appeals. Booker also emphasized the historic nature of her nomination. Mentioning Black figures such as Harriet Tubman and Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to serve as a federal judge, Booker said to Jackson: “Today, you’re my star. You are my harbinger of hope. “You are worthy. You are a great American … I know what it’s taken for you to sit in that seat,” he said.",News/US news,‘You’re my star’: high points of Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmation hearings,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/26/ketanji-brown-jackson-confirmation-hearings-highlights
3/26/2022,"In late September 2021, Firas, his wife and four-month-old son have been checked in to a smart Hilton business hotel in London. With green velvet sofas in the lobby and pink orchids at reception, it seems designed to bathe visitors in an atmosphere of corporate calm; in sharp contrast, Firas, 32, a former guard at the British embassy in Kabul, exudes a jangling, nervous sense of distress. Six weeks after a dramatic evacuation from Afghanistan, he remains so shaken that he is waking most nights at 3am and pacing the hotel corridors in tears. “I can’t enjoy the hotel. I can’t concentrate on my new life. I’m too worried about the people I’ve left behind,” he says, bent over a table in the lobby, head in his hands. A few miles away in another part of south London, Ali, 35, who spent eight years working as a programme and finance manager with the UK’s Department for International Development (DfID) in Afghanistan, is isolating inside one room of a quarantine hotel with his wife Zohrab, his nine-year-old daughter and his two sons, aged six and five. A Taliban death threat forced Ali to flee to London a year before his wife and children were evacuated in August 2021, and their recent reunion in this small, sixth-floor room overlooking the Thames was incredibly emotional. “My kids were jumping all over me. I was just so relieved that they were safe,” Ali says. He found them dehydrated and hungry, still wearing the clothes they had left home in. The room is crowded, and the children are sleeping on the floor. They spend their days examining their new home out of the hotel window, trying to spot police boats on the river and finding enormous enjoyment in mimicking the unfamiliar words their father uses when he calls down to reception. “They find it so funny. They tease me, copying my voice, saying, ‘Good morning’ to each other.” Meanwhile, in a shabby 1960s concrete hotel block in central London, Hussein, 36, his wife Hamida, their six children, his sister-in-law and her child are trying to make three adjacent third-floor rooms feel homely. With his first payment of refugee subsistence money, Hussein, a strikingly tall former translator for the British army in Afghanistan’s Helmand province, has bought a few small pot plants to balance on the windowsill. The children are still terrified by their recent escape. “We waited four days outside the airport, some of the time standing in a dirty canal. My children saw the Taliban firing guns. They had to be pulled to safety by US soldiers,” he says when we meet in the square outside. “I want them to feel safe now. They’re spending all day lying on the bed, watching cartoons on television.” Over two weeks last August, 15,000 people were airlifted out of Afghanistan after it fell to the Taliban. The rescue was often chaotic. Desperate refugees were seen clinging on to the undercarriage of an overcrowded plane as it prepared to take off from Kabul; a bomb had gone off near the British evacuation headquarters, killing more than 100 people; it was clear that many people eligible for evacuation had been left behind. The launch of Operation Warm Welcome seemed to be an attempt to shift attention back to the positive. Almost all the Afghans were transferred to roughly 80 hotels around the country while officials began searching for permanent homes for them. “The UK has a proud history of providing safe haven to those in need,” said the prime minister, Boris Johnson. “I am determined that we welcome them with open arms.” As time has worn on, though, the resettlement has proved sluggish. While 4,000 people have been housed to date, another 12,000 remain stranded in hotels (the figures are a bit fluid because more people were evacuated throughout the autumn and early this year). As tourists return to London, some of the hotels initially happy to accommodate refugees have asked them to leave, so families are being uprooted again and bussed to hotels in Leeds, Warwick and Manchester. For the first six months of their new lives in the UK, I kept in touch with three Afghan families to find out how welcomed they have felt, discussing their surprise at cultural differences, their struggles against bureaucracy, homesickness and lingering trauma. As a new crisis looms due to the war in Ukraine, Afghan refugees worry that their urgent need for housing will be forgotten amid the public’s surge of concern for the newly displaced. The government has developed a cautious approach to the new wave of refugees. Most of the new arrivals will stay with family and friends, and there will be no repeat of the mass hotel placements, in apparent recognition that the Afghan policy has not been a success. Ihad been in email contact with Firas for several weeks before we met. He had contacted the Guardian in August to share the fears of a large number of British embassy guards whose evacuation applications had been rejected on the grounds that they were not direct embassy employees, but subcontracted by a Canadian outsourcing company, GardaWorld. Firas pointed out that this nuanced quibbling was not a distinction that would be made by the Taliban. “I am feeling insecure and hopeless. I am waiting for death at any moment,” he emailed in the first of a series of desperate messages. There had already been an attempt to set fire to his car, which he blamed on the Taliban. A few days later, the British embassy was closed, he was sacked from his job, and he began to worry about how he was going to feed his family. Publicity about the government’s decision not to grant sanctuary to GardaWorld staff triggered a belated U-turn from the Foreign Office, and a promise that embassy guards would be helped to the UK. But the commitment came too late: the evacuation mission ended before the security staff could be flown out. Of his 120 colleagues, only Firas managed to push himself and his family through the crowds to reach the British evacuation processing centre. Teargas was fired, his baby got hit by the barrel of a gun and his wife fainted; concerned soldiers pulled them from the crush and they were granted places on a flight out. Back in the hotel lobby, for much of the time we spend talking (with interpretation help from another refugee), Firas stares at the floor, his head bowed. He smiles only when his wife joins him, wheeling their baby in a pushchair donated by a charity. They have been given warm clothes, but have barely ventured outside; they have no money, and are too worried about the situation in Afghanistan to feel curious. After his departure, his family in Kabul were visited by armed men asking where he and his brother had disappeared to; unable to answer, his father was arrested and held by the Taliban for two days. Firas and his wife spend most of the time sitting in their second-floor bedroom, looking out at the hotel car park, their baby lying swaddled in a blanket on the bed. Firas has registered with a GP and has been prescribed tranquillisers, which he says are not helping with the night terrors. “I’ve lived with my mother and father, sat with them, eaten meals with them, for 32 years, and I’ve left them there,” he says. “I shouldn’t have left them alone.” After completing quarantine, Ali and Zohrab move from their riverside hotel and spend October in a huge, modern business hotel on a busy central London road. To begin with, the families from Afghanistan are mixed in with the tourists, and there is daily chaos in the breakfast canteen. Ali says he overheard startled guests asking reception if the noisy teenagers filling the lobby were in London on a school trip. Zohrab’s experience of fleeing Kabul in August was nightmarish, and she is still distressed by memories of the violence they witnessed as they tried to leave. The first day they made their way through the crowds by the airport, they were turned away. “A soldier said, ‘If you don’t leave, I will fire on you.’ We left,” she says. They tried again the next day, and eventually the family were allowed through. Zohrab needs winter shoes, but news of the distribution of charitable donations seems to her to be controlled by Pashtun men, and she wonders if there is some subtle discrimination against Hazara families, like hers. By the time she and her husband find out that there has been a new delivery of donations, only the most damaged secondhand items remain. “The children cannot understand why we never get told when toys are being handed out,” she says. She is also increasingly irritated by the patriarchal attitudes to women displayed by some male evacuees in the hotel. Recently, she reprimanded a man for pushing in during a queue for lunch, and was annoyed to be told: “Who are you to tell me what to do?” Ali has been impressed at her ability to stand up for herself. “She told him: ‘You can’t behave like that here.’ People here think everyone from Afghanistan comes from the same background, but there are lots of different people with different values stuck together in the hotel.” Ali, who speaks flawless English and had a high-powered job with the Foreign Office, has started to notice chaotic aspects of the resettlement programme. He is puzzled by how long it has taken officials to register their arrival, and annoyed that as soon as this is done, another group of officials from a different government department arrive to begin the process again. But despite the chaos, this is also a happy time for the family. Swiping through the images saved on her phone, Zohrab shows smiling pictures of the children at the zoo (the former British ambassador to Afghanistan is director general of the Zoological Society of London and let them in free); outside the House of Commons; feeding swans in Hyde Park. By November, Hussein, the former British army translator, has had no news of where he might end up living permanently, but the local council in this part of central London has found temporary school places for his three sons and two older daughters, aged between 11 and five. The day before they start, we meet in a tree-lined square near the hotel; Hussein is unflustered by the prospect of talking to me while supervising five children, who race each other around the pathways on donated scooters. Hussein has a commanding parental presence, calmly intervening in squabbles, distributing biscuits, occasionally standing up to signal that the youngest child should stop scooting while holding an iPad under her arm (another charitable donation). His wife is stuck upstairs in the room with their one-year-old baby; he knows she is finding things harder than him, without any English. She was brought up in a conservative part of rural Jalalabad, was not sent to school and is finding the move to London a culture shock. She was taken aback to see that all the families in the hotel are expected to eat together in the dining room, with no separation of men and women. “She noticed a woman arguing loudly in the street with a man, and said: ‘In Afghanistan you’re the king, but here, it’s the women who are the kings,’” Hussein says. Many of the evacuated adults have started attending weekly cultural acclimatisation classes run by two women from Afghanistan who have been in London for a number of years. “We were told that people here don’t let their children go to school alone, they have to drop them and collect them,” Hussein says, adding that many families in his old neighbourhood were accustomed to letting even very young children make their own way to school. “They told us not to talk in the street to girls. And that beating your wife or your children is a crime in this country. Some of the people from Afghanistan didn’t know this. I’ve said to them: this is England, we’re starting a new life here.” The national effort to welcome the 15,000 evacuated in August has been both extraordinary and underwhelming. Amazon wishlists were set up by councils, inviting members of the public to buy everything families needed – from nappies to nail clippers. For the first few weeks, council staff worked overtime making sure baby food was distributed to the right hotel rooms. British diplomats who had worked in Afghanistan formed WhatsApp groups to offer practical and moral support to their former colleagues, fundraising and helping them write CVs and apply for jobs. Staff working for big hotel chains, such as the Hilton and Radisson, found themselves organising GP appointments and babysitting for the children of unwell refugees. In most families only the men, who had had jobs with the British, speak English. Hotel staff became adept at using Google Translate on their phones. Nothing could be taken for granted. Some local colleges began running cultural training sessions, explaining the rules of zebra crossings and what a flashing green man means, and teaching people how to respond to a fire alarm. “We noticed only the men came downstairs during a fire drill, so we had to explain that everyone needs to leave the room,” a teacher says. But the response has been patchwork. Some councils worked hard to get children into schools by October; elsewhere it took longer. There were delays in getting people registered for benefits and issued with the crucial biometric residence passes that allow them to start looking for work. Everyone was wrestling with the chicken-and-egg problem of not being able to start thinking about work until they had improved their English, had somewhere to live and had settled their children in schools. But council-run English classes were only funded to begin once people were settled in their permanent home, so thousands have been abandoned in hotel rooms with nothing to occupy their time. While everyone accepts that the August evacuation was an inevitably rushed response to a crisis, councils across the country were furious that the Home Office gave them little warning that families were being moved into hotels in their area. Some were based on busy roads. When a five-year-old fell to his death from a window of a hotel in Sheffield, questions were asked about whether the correct health and safety checks had been made. The initial distribution of people was uneven, and 4,000 were sent to London where there were the most big, empty hotels because of the pandemic-induced slump in tourism. Some were housed in stucco-fronted buildings, with marble corridors and 19th-century oils; others were sent to “cheap as chips” establishments, described by charities as “accommodation of last-resort”. One London council had just a couple of days’ warning that 2,000 people (including 900 children) would be housed in its hotels. It has worked steadily to find temporary school places, while making it clear that permanent homes will have to be found elsewhere, because of chronic housing shortages in the capital. But the longer people remain in hotels, the more complex it is to resettle them in towns elsewhere. “They start to put down roots. It’s not entirely clear what the strategy is for getting people out now,” says a senior council official responsible for the resettlement programme. There is rising dismay among people who work in the refugee sector. Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, warns that “many of the people who fled Afghanistan to the UK are still not getting the warm welcome they were promised”. Nick Forbes, head of the local government association’s asylum, refugee and migration task group, and the Labour leader of Newcastle city council, is more forthright: Operation Warm Welcome has “turned out to be about as welcoming as a cold bucket of sick”. In late October, six weeks after our first meeting, Firas and his family have been moved to a new hotel. Approximately 200 refugees from Afghanistan have been transferred from different hotels around London to this inconveniently placed block, 20 miles from the capital. It’s an ugly, one-storey, 1980s conference centre off an A-road, designed for business delegates with cars. There are no nearby shops, bus stops or train stations. “The Home Office didn’t say why we had to move,” Firas says, sitting in the hotel restaurant, still looking shattered by the trauma of abandoning his home and family. This hotel is much noisier, and in the lobby there are about 15 children squashed on sofas, their heads tilted together over shared iPads, while younger ones sit around a low table working on colouring sheets. “Yes, this place is a bit cheaper than the last place,” he says, pointing to a dining room table where the laminate has peeled off to reveal crumbling, splintering chipboard. “The problem is not that this is a worse hotel. What we’re worried about is our families stuck in Afghanistan, and when we’re going to get permanent housing.” Every week, a Home Office representative visits to talk to residents. “He sees every family separately, but just tells us: ‘We don’t know how long you’ll be here. We can’t tell you if it will be weeks or months.’ All he says is: ‘You have to wait.’” Every time he meets an official, Firas wants to talk about whether his parents will be allowed to join him in Britain. “They usually say: ‘We can’t talk about your family in Afghanistan. We’re here to take your details.” Current rules make it very unlikely family members will be given permission to reunite in the UK. There is very little space to move around in his hotel room, between the cot, double bed and pram. Every surface is covered with clothes or nappies, tidily stacked. Firas stays up as late as possible, talking to the other men in the lobby, to try to hold off the insomnia that hits when he goes to bed. “If I stay in the room, I disturb my wife and son. Sometimes I stand in the car park for an hour or two, waiting until I think I will be able to sleep.” Aware that the process of moving people into houses is going slowly, Ali quickly decides to take matters into his own hands and informs Home Office officials that he wants to move back to the Midlands, where he had been based before his wife and children came to join him. A house has been found, and they move in late October. His years of experience working alongside Foreign Office staff in Afghanistan have made him adept at leaping over bureaucratic hurdles. His own difficult experiences on arrival in the UK in 2020 taught him not to trust British officials to make things easy for refugees. When he received a death threat related to his work for the Foreign Office, he knew he needed to leave Kabul immediately; he said goodbye to his wife and three children, bought a ticket, flew to Heathrow, where he showed the UK visa in his passport (granted for a work conference) and immediately claimed asylum. He assumed that his long service with the British government would mean his case would be taken seriously. Instead, he was locked up in an immigration removal centre. “I told them I worked for DfID, I showed them the death threat, but I was treated like a prisoner. I was held with criminals, smugglers, people who were about to be deported. I was very frightened,” he says. It was months before he was recognised as a refugee. By November, when I visit, the family has moved to their new home in the Midlands – an unloved two-storey redbrick end of terrace house, with scrubby weeds flattened by huge green bins in the front yard. They have bought furniture from the British Heart Foundation and the house is beginning to feel a bit like home, with small shoes lined up on a rack by the front door and plants on a table in the front room. Looking around at the bare walls, Zohrab says she wishes she had been able to bring even a few photographs of her family when she fled, but they were told there would no room for luggage on the evacuation flight. Ali has begun a part-time job as an adviser with the charity Refugee Action; all three children have started school and, compared with many of the other 15,000 evacuees, the family has made enormous progress in settling into their new lives. But new worries are emerging every day. After months out of school, his nine-year-old daughter had invested a lot of hope in the prospect of being back in a classroom, and was badly disappointed. “She feels like people are making fun of her, teasing her because she can’t communicate with them,” Ali says. “She said: ‘You promised me that things would change and I would get friends here.’” A teacher told him at pickup that his middle son has refused to eat lunch again. “The council says there will be English classes from January, but what’s going to happen until then? I asked my son: ‘What did you learn today?’ He said: ‘I don’t know. I didn’t understand anything.’” Privately, he is also worried about how Zohrab is coping. “She has no friends here, so I’m trying to step in. Sometimes I say: ‘Come on, let’s go for a walk to the park.’ I have to keep reminding her, the most important thing is that now the children are OK and we are safe.” Four months after the evacuation, a gloomy routine of sorts has been established in most hotels. Babies have been born, marriages have broken down under the strain, a few evacuees have died from longstanding illnesses. Every morning in the lobby of an east London hotel, an 82-year-old two-star general sits by himself in a long black coat, hunched over sheets of paper and a cup of black tea, using his military strategising skills to compile lists of children who need English classes. Occasionally he is joined by other men, who are also trying to fill their aimless days. “Everyone feels depressed and tired,” he says. A well-known former MP in Afghanistan (who asks for her name not to be printed) greets him politely, and pauses on the other side of the reception area to offer advice to a group of mothers waiting for medical appointments, organised in the hotel’s business centre. In the dining room, families queue up for slices of white bread, fruit and an unpopular, hard-to-identify lentil dish ladled out of a steel vat. “If the government is paying for this, why can’t they get the hotel to make Afghan food?” the former MP asks. She is anxious to disabuse people of the idea that any of the hotel’s residents are thrilled at finding themselves in the UK. “Everyone is happy that our lives have been saved but our hearts are still in Afghanistan. Imagine one day you have everything in your life, and the next day you open your eyes and you have nothing. That’s how we feel,” she says. “No one chose to leave their homes and if it became safe there again, most of us would go back. When I speak to people and they say, ‘Let’s catch up’, I say, ‘Yes, let’s meet for coffee in Kabul.’ We have to keep that dream alive.” In early January, Firas is in touch with happy news: his brother, Omar, a journalist who also worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs under the old regime, and who fled Kabul a couple of weeks before him, has managed to make his way to Britain in a small boat with 22 other asylum seekers. But Operation Warm Welcome extends only to people who came through the official evacuation programme. Despite the fact that he has fled exactly the same threats in Afghanistan, Omar has been plunged straight into the Home Office’s hostile environment. On arrival he was taken immediately to an immigration centre, where everyone’s clothes, shoes, socks and money were put in plastic bags and locked away. He was held in a custody centre for several days before being transferred to a basement room in a hotel by London’s Victoria station. While Firas has begun receiving universal credit payments, and has had a meeting with the jobcentre about roles he can apply for, his brother is not allowed to study or work until his asylum application has been cleared. The hotel where he is staying is full of other asylum seekers – from Morocco, Afghanistan, Iraq – and many of them have been waiting months for a decision on their claims. “When I say I’m feeling frustrated because I’ve been waiting for five months for a decision on my claim, they laugh and say: ‘We’ve been here for a year,’” Omar says. Omar is worried about the effect of new legislation currently being debated in parliament, which will make it possible to sentence people who arrive in the UK by small boats to four years in prison. “Will I be criminalised because I came in a boat?” he asks. No one is saying that allocating houses to 15,000 new arrivals is a simple task, but refugee charities point out that these numbers should be manageable if every local authority stepped forward to offer empty homes to Afghan families. Germany accommodated more than one million asylum seekers between 2015 and 2016. Analysing the pace of rehousing, refugee organisations estimate that, at the current rate, it will be another year and a half before everyone is moved out of hotels. Last year the British Red Cross published research on the damaging effects of housing refugees for protracted periods in temporary accommodation, highlighting the negative impact on mental health. People who work with the Afghan refugees in hotels say they become increasingly institutionalised the longer they stay, unable to start building independent lives. As well as being unsuitable, the cost is exorbitant: it has been revealed that the government is spending £1.2m a day on hotels for evacuees from Afghanistan (and a total of £4.7m a day on hotel rooms for all asylum seekers). Seven months on from the evacuation, no one wants to take responsibility for the slow progress. Defensive officials mutter that it is the fault of the refugees themselves for being too picky about where they will agree to live, and say the available housing stock is not designed for larger families. The government says it is “proud this country has provided homes for more than 4,000 Afghan evacuees in such a short space of time”. But the vast majority of those airlifted out are still being shunted between hotels around the country. At the start of March, the owners of the huge central hotel where Ali and Zohrab spent a few weeks decided not to renew its contract with the government and 400 refugees were put on buses and driven to more remote hotels around the country. “My five-year-old daughter has been in a local primary school here for four months. Her teacher was crying on Friday, and she cried, too. It’s so hard for her to move again after making new friends,” a former British embassy administrative worker says, despondent as he packs for a new hotel in Warwickshire. He will miss the language exam he was due to take at a local college, and will have to find a new GP, make new friends, settle his daughter in a new school. “We don’t know if the next place we move to will be where we end up. Or will they move us again? Everyone is wondering when they are going to be able to start their new lives.” Some people with good English have started working; a former military policeman, who worked alongside the British, says he is delighted (after interviewing for six or seven jobs) finally to be working at a fashionable pub in Chelsea, while another young man in the same hotel has found work as a shop assistant in Zara. A couple of weeks after the launch of Operation Warm Welcome, a council official working on the resettlement programme said success would mean having all the new arrivals accommodated, self-sufficient and living happy, independent lives. This still seems a distant prospect. With news that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could see up to four million people flee their homes, prompting Europe’s largest refugee crisis for decades, it’s clear that the government’s frequently repeated mantra about Britain having a proud history of welcoming refugees needs to be backed up with more convincing action. At the end of January, Hussein is cheerful. He has had no news about when his family could be moved from the hotel, but he has been to the jobcentre and is thinking about applying for work as a translator. He has cut his hair into a shorter English style and bought himself a smart suit. A charity has given the family £100 of Primark vouchers and his children all have new clothes. They are finding school interesting, coming home with new phrases to try out on their mother. “Nice to meet you”, “Oh my God!”, “Bring some water.” At the weekends, Hussein enjoys visiting the British Museum with his family. Occasionally his children cry from homesickness. “We had a big house in Afghanistan, with a garden with orange trees, apple trees, a lawn,” Hussein says. “They would play outside all the time. Sometimes they’re very sad in the hotel. They miss their toys, their grandparents, their bicycles. So I have to explain the situation again. You saw the shooting on the way here? Our neighbours would have killed us if we’d stayed. That’s why we came.” He feels it is his responsibility to buoy up their mood by reminding them of the positives. “I don’t think Afghanistan will ever be rebuilt in my lifetime. I’ve told my children that here they can become scientists, dancers, pilots, doctors, politicians, engineers. They will work here and pay taxes here, and pay back the support they’re getting now,” he says. When we meet in late January, Firas shows me a new video he has been sent by relatives that shows armed men coming again to the house where his father has been hiding, tying his father’s hands with rope and leading him to a truck. Firas has had no information about where he has been taken. News about the collapse of the economy and looming famine has intensified his fears for his family; the UN has warned that 23 million people, more than half the population, face starvation. He is still waiting for an update about when he and his family will be moved from the hotel. Both he and his wife are impatient to start studying English, but there are no classes. “No one can tell us anything about the houses. They said it would be before Christmas, then they said by mid-January. Everyone is depressed. We feel we are wasting our time.” In the Midlands, Ali feels frazzled, working part-time while his children are at nursery. He is suppressing a sense of frustration that his skills as a development expert are not being called on by former Foreign Office colleagues confronted by the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Zohrab has started a 10-week course of English classes, with afternoon sessions on British law and culture, but his children are still not getting any language support at school and continue to struggle. His daughter had been thriving academically in Kabul, but is increasingly withdrawing into herself. “I’m trying not to be pessimistic but I can see they’re still not enjoying it. The middle one often says, ‘I’m not going to school. I don’t like it. They’re not friendly.’ I say: ‘I know it’s hard but you will get friends.’” He is doing his best to motivate them. “My son wants to be a policeman. I say the best way is to integrate, learn to speak English, be bright. He asked me, ‘Are we going to be English?’ I said, ‘You are already English. You have to adapt, but this is your home now.’” All names have been changed.",News/World news,Welcome to Britain … now what?

3/26/2022,"Britain’s biggest supermarkets stand accused of “bombarding” shoppers with offers of cheap meat, despite pledging to promote more meat-free diets to improve health and tackle global heating. They are using money-saving promotions, such as two for the price of one, as a way of “pushing” meat, at odds with moves in the UK and globally for consumers to eat less of it, research found. Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons are each offering scores of deals every week on meat products such as burgers and sausages to drive sales and boost their profits, according to a report from the charity Eating Better. It is an umbrella group representing more than 60 organisations including WWF UK, Greenpeace, public health bodies, dietitians, the RSPCA and food charities. The report also discloses that only 1% of the many hundreds of multi-buy offers for meat products examined by researchers will be banned when the government’s crackdown on the promotion of foodstuffs that are high in fat, salt or sugar – to tackle childhood obesity – begins in October. Marketing of such foods will be outlawed on TV before the 9pm “watershed” and also online, though the food industry is trying to persuade ministers to delay or water down both plans. “Supermarkets are bombarding us with Bogof [buy one, get one free] burgers, sausages and cheap chicken of unknown origin, putting profit before population health and that of the planet,” said Simon Billing, Eating Better’s executive director. “The Big Four are contradicting their own commitments by encouraging customers to buy more meat than they would have if it hadn’t been on promotion. “The impact of this is that we’re eating more meat than we need, or is good for us. Pushing cheap meat into our baskets also supports intensive animal farming, which is wrecking the planet, emitting a huge amount of greenhouse gas and requiring massive amounts of our precious resources, such as land and water.” The government-commissioned national food strategy, published last July, said Britons needed to reduce their intake of meat by 30% by 2032 in order to help combat the UK’s “plague of dietary ill-health” and the climate emergency. Such a dramatic fall was “significant and it won’t be easy to achieve” but was vital to help reduce methane emissions from livestock farming and free up land so it could be used to store carbon, it said. While meat intake in Britain is falling slowly, people still eat almost double the global average. The food strategy also noted that “our taste for ruminants … is a major contributor to climate change”. Major changes needed to be made to the national diet within a decade “to meet health, climate and nature commitments”, including Britons eating 30% more fruit and vegetables, 50% more fibre, 25% less junk food containing high levels of fat, salt or sugar and 30% less meat. The government’s climate change committee has also said people should reduce their intake of meat by 20%-50% to help the UK meet its target of reaching net zero by 2050. Eating Better’s report on the promotion of meat sales is based on research by the Questionmark Foundation, a European research institute based in the Netherlands. It examined all promotions for meat and fish that the four food chains put on their websites over five weeks last August and September. It found that: While Morrisons and Asda ran 1,490 and 1,352 promotions respectively, Tesco (948) and Sainsbury’s (933) ran many fewer. Asda and Morrisons run a lot of multi-buy offers for animal products, such as three for £10, three for the price of two and buy one get one free. Sainsbury’s uses discounts on meat products to persuade people to buy them. “The Questionmark research shows that supermarkets are making it even harder for us to eat less meat by encouraging us to buy more meat than we would have, if it hadn’t been on promotion,” said Billing. “Supermarkets need to come to terms, and quite quickly, with selling less meat and instead, promote more veg and healthy plant proteins, which are better for us, our pocket and the planet.” He urged ministers to extend the junk food ban to cover meat promotions. An Asda spokesperson said: “We recognise the need to provide customers with meat-free alternatives and have expanded our plant-based range by 50% in the past year and committed to doubling sales from plant-based products by 2023.” It ran fewer meat promotions after the study period ended in September because barbecues and outdoor eating declined, they added. A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “This report is not an accurate reflection of our commitment to ‘help everyone eat better’. We aim to make a healthy and varied diet accessible to everyone [and are] investing significantly in keeping prices low on products such as fruit, veg, grains, meat and fish.” Tesco did not respond directly. But it highlighted the emphasis it had put on meat-free dishes in recent years, in line with changing tastes, including launching its own-brand Wicked Kitchen array of vegan foods and Plant Chef vegetarian range. Morrisons did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Environment,UK supermarkets accused of ‘bombarding’ shoppers with cheap meat,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/26/uk-supermarkets-accused-of-bombarding-shoppers-with-cheap-meat
3/26/2022,"From 1 April, most households in Great Britain will see their energy bills rise by 54% – or almost £700 – to just under £2,000 a year. It will be the biggest rise in living memory but may only be the start. Here we answer all your questions about the fuel crisis and examine what help is available. That is the day energy suppliers are allowed to increase their variable gas and electricity tariffs to the new maximum set by the energy regulator, Ofgem. Almost all households are now on these capped gas and electricity tariffs – about 22 million in total. Across providers, the unit prices of the gas and electricity and the standing charges – the amount charged each day to supply a household – are rising. The energy firms can only charge up to the capped rates, and the average dual-fuel bill can’t exceed £1,971. Bigger-using households will have substantially larger annual bills. Hidden within the new bills are big increases in electricity standing charges, and the unit price of gas. For example, Shell Energy recently told its customers in the east of England area that its electricity standing charge was rising from 24.01p to 37.92p a day, – a 57% rise. The rate for each unit of electricity goes up by 40% to 29.24p a kWh. Its gas standing charges are set to increase by just over 4% but the cost of each unit is rising by 81% from 4.05p to 7.34p a kWh. Other suppliers are imposing similar increases. Unfortunately, Friday’s increase is only the start of the pain as prices are expected to go up again in six months’ time. The regulator, Ofgem, announced next week’s increase several weeks before the war in Ukraine had started, sending wholesale gas prices even higher. In July, Ofgem staff will begin to calculate what it thinks the new price cap should be based on the wholesale costs, and unless there is a remarkable reversal in the market, experts are warning the new cap will be at about £2,500-£3,000 a year. Three years ago, wholesale gas cost about 40p a therm in the UK. This week the price hovered at about 240p a therm, having earlier peaked at 460p. The price cap applies to all default tariffs, or standard variable tariffs, as they are also known. You are on one unless you have actively chosen another deal. If you have never switched your energy tariff, you were on a fixed deal that has expired, or you were with a supplier that has gone bust, then you are on a capped deal. Guardian Money has been contacted by several readers in recent months complaining their energy bills are close to doubling and asking how it can be so. Households who signed up to fixed-price tariffs in the previous two years – deals that have just come to an end – are, going from a very cheap tariff to what has become a very high one. It may feel unfair but they are now just paying the same as everyone else. This week, Martin Lewis told MPs that the energy companies have been playing “fast and loose” by increasing direct debits beyond what is justified. Guardian Money readers have described receiving demands that double, and even triple, their monthly payments. Provided you are currently in credit, your energy supplier should not be increasing your direct debits by more than 54% – the amount prices are increasing. If it tries to do so, you can decline. Ultimately, there is nothing to stop you from logging in to online banking – or contacting your bank – and cancelling the direct debit. You can set up another one later at a figure that better reflects your usage. That said, there is little point in setting it too low as you will end up in arrears. Most households will prefer to pay a consistent sum all year and build up a balance in the summer that will get them through the winter months when consumption balloons and prices are expected to be even higher. A household expecting bills to rise to £2,400 a year in October will need to be paying about £180-£200 a month now if they want to come out near zero this time next year. If you are planning to cut your consumption (who isn’t?) then you can reduce payments proportionally. Those supplying regular meter readings will be able to better judge whether their account is falling behind or running a surplus, and adjust their payments accordingly as the year progresses. You can opt to pay on receipt of your bill but the charges are higher – about £95 a year on average. Probably not. Guardian Money reader Clive Macdonald emailed recently saying he had just signed up to a two-year dual-fuel deal for £480 a month – up from the £163 a month he is currently paying. His current fixed-price tariff comes to an end soon. “In a panic, I signed up, having found it impossible to get anything through Uswitch or similar platforms, and I am now wondering if that’s the best option and whether taking a chance on a variable plan might be better,” he wrote. We advised him to use his 14-day cooling-off period to exit a tariff that would have left him paying a shade under £5,000 a year – up from the £1,956 he currently pays. By taking this deal he would be paying the higher charges now rather than in October. There are a few two-year fixed-rate tariffs out there – however, they are much more expensive than the cap. The comparison sites – which make money from switching consumers – are telling people to stay put, which tells you all you need to know. This week Utility Warehouse claimed it was offering the UK’s cheapest variable energy tariff, which will offer a saving of £98 a year below the April cap. However, there is a major caveat: you have to also switch your broadband and mobile phone contracts, something that most households won’t be in a position, or want, to do. Elsewhere, Octopus Energy is offering customers who have been with it for eight months or more a variable tariff £50 cheaper than the price cap – but that’s about it. Yes. Provided you pay council tax, and you live in a house in bands A-D, you will receive a £150 rebate next month. Your most recent bill will tell you which band your house is in. Those who live in homes in bands E to H may also qualify if they receive certain benefits. If you pay your council tax by direct debit, your local council will pay the £150 directly into your bank account. If you don’t, it is worth setting one up now ;this will make it easier to get the money. Otherwise, you will need to apply for the rebate. In October, energy customers will get £200 knocked off bills, but they will need to repay that over the next five years. Talk to your supplier and explain the situation. The big suppliers offer hardship funds that may give you a grant to help pay off the debt. Citizens Advice has a list of the hardship funds and how to apply. You will have to provide detailed information about your financial situation in your application. Households in Great Britain may also be able to get £150 off their electricity bill for next winter via the warm home discount scheme. Councils in England have been given £1bn for a household support fund to help the most vulnerable. Contact your local council to see what, if anything, is on offer in your area.

3/26/2022,"Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey, Britain’s two biggest housebuilders, handed their chief executives bumper bonuses last year, when building bounced back amid a house price boom. Persimmon boss Dean Finch received a total pay and bonus package of £2.6m last year, the York-based builder’s annual report showed. That compared with £218,326 in 2020, although he only took over as boss in September of that year. His pay included a £725,000 salary, a £1.3m annual bonus, and a buyout award of £404,384 to make up for earnings he lost out on when he left his previous employer, National Express. Finch’s fixed pay and benefits of £833,742 was 32 times the £26,005 that Persimmon’s lowest-paid quartile were paid last year. However, Finch’s package was still well short of the £110m proposed bonus for Jeff Fairburn, who served as Persimmon’s chief executive until November 2018. The bonus was cut to £75m and Fairburn promised to give a “substantial” amount to charity, but he was still ousted in November 2018. It prompted public outrage, especially as the housebuilder partially relied on the government’s help to buy programme for its sales. The £29bn help to buy scheme, which is aimed at first-time buyers and ends next year, was criticised by a House of Lords report in January for failing to “provide good value for money” for the taxpayer. Fairburn has since made a comeback with Berkeley DeVeer, a Wetherby-based housebuilder in which he acquired a controlling stake in January 2020. A year later, the company acquired another builder, Avant Homes. At Taylor Wimpey, the outgoing chief executive Pete Redfern received a total pay and perks package of £2.8m last year, up from £1.1m in 2020, according to its annual report. It included a cash and share bonus of £1.3m whereas in 2020, at the height of the pandemic, the company decided to cancel executive bonuses. Redfern has run the company for 15 years and is handing over to Jennie Daly, the current group operations director, who becomes chief executive at the annual meeting in late April. Her total remuneration rose to £1.3m last year from £515,000 in 2020. Taylor Wimpey’s median pay and benefits for employees is £46,455, while the lowest quartile is paid £31,651. Revenues at the housebuilder rose 54% from 2020 to £4.3bn last year, similar to its pre-pandemic revenues, while profit before tax jumped 157% to £680m. This was still below its 2019 profit of £836m. Persimmon made a profit before tax of nearly £1bn last year, up by a quarter from 2019, as it completed 14,551 homes, generating revenues of £3.6bn. The Berkeley Group chief executive Rob Perrins is the highest-paid boss of a UK housebuilder. He received just under £8m in salary and share bonuses last year. Most of this, £7.3m, was a payout from a 2011 long-term incentive plan, a share bonanza that also prompted public criticism. The seven-strong executive team at the London and southeast-focused builder collectively received around £24m in pay and perks last year.
