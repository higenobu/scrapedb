2/28/2022,"Woods, and Us I grew up in a wood.Well, no. I slept in bedbut spent my days by blackbirds. Rookscawed in my head. I found the thrush’s nest,her cup of warm-pressed mud.The beech trees straining to their lightsighed in my blood. We never owned that place,I moved at eight. And soin town gardens, in narrow space,I watched trees grow where sparrows shrilled, but neighboursfretted for light or drains.Now, many blackbirds later,I find wide woods again which few of us can grow,which no one truly owns,new pine tips which flash red, long pathsdry as our bones. The children storm high walls,the broadest ground they knowbeyond tall timber, bird or fox,our woods, where people grow. From Alison Brackenbury’s latest collection, Thorpeness, Woods, and Us visits scenes and sounds from the poet’s childhood in rural Lincolnshire. The iambic quatrain moulding the narrative consists of two lines of trimeter, a third line of tetrameter and, usually, a final dimeter. It’s a structure loosely related to the oral tradition of the ballad, one which Brackenbury often invokes in her poetry. Here, there’s a gliding, almost casual treatment of the form. It suggests variety: the different species of trees and birds, even the building of a nest from diverse materials. Only the first and third stanzas have an ABAB rhyme-scheme, the others being rhymed ABCB. “Grow” is repeated three times as an end word, twice as the B-rhyme, echoing but altering the verb-in-apposition of the opening line “I grew up in a wood”. The repetition of “grow” unobtrusively emphasises abundance, as if new green shoots were dotted around the poem. A little opening joke (“I grew up in a wood. / Well, no. I slept in bed” ) is a graceful point of entry for the reader, and although the tone will be pitched higher than this in subsequent stanzas, the informality of the personal account continues to ground the more heightened moments, and provide a base for the reader’s trust. The narrator’s identification with the woods is declared twice, emphasised by the shared syntax of the last lines of the first and second quatrains: “Rooks / cawed in my head” and “The beech trees straining to their light / sighed in my blood.” The use of both realistic and metaphorical registers amplifies this inner “possession”. While the caws of the rooks are audibly present, readers may like a reminder of the lovely sounds surrounding a speaker who “spent [her] days by blackbirds.” Here it is. Urban realities intrude when the narrator has to leave the place “never owned” and discovers that trees are not always welcome. The choice of “light” and “drains” as the focus of the difficulty is significant. Drainage and light are as essenial to arboreal survival as they are to the wellbeing of humans. An apocalyptic scene replaces easy solace when the exile returns “many blackbirds later” to “find wide woods again”. Pines whose new growth “flashes red”, and the “long paths / dry as our bones” indicate drought, disease and, ultimately, human extinction. There’s collective responsibility implied in the pronoun-shift from the first-person singular, as if to challenge the pleasure and significance of the previous discoveries. Woods “which few of us can grow, / which no one truly owns” may literally be beyond us, moving out of reach. The verb “grow”, transitive here (ie “few of us can grow woods”) becomes intransitive in the last line of the poem: “our woods, where people grow.” As in stanza four, the dimeter elsewhere favoured for the closing line of the stanza becomes a trimeter, moving the poem away from ballad form and closer to the measure known in hymn-writing prosody as short metre. A fine, emphatic conclusion, the stanza re-illuminates the influence of growing (up) in a wood, and drawing on its nutrients, with the further implication that it’s by living in and with nature that the young attain full stature, as “people”. The new generation of children appears still to have access to the woods and all the possibilities they represent, but the “high walls” and the ominous “red alert” of the previous stanza remain in place.",Arts/Books,"Poem of the week: Woods, and Us by Alison Brackenbury",https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2022/feb/28/poem-of-the-week-woods-and-us-by-alison-brackenbury
2/28/2022,"“Families are the scariest thing on the planet,” says a teenage girl in this Irish horror film from young director Kate Dolan, making a seriously impressive debut. It’s the dead of night in a suburban cul-de-sac outside Dublin: a baby is in the middle of the street, alone and whimpering in its pushchair. A woman scurries out of a house, pushes the buggy into nearby woods and lights a fire. For the next hour or so the film feels like a slow-burn slice of drab family drama: claustrophobic, but not obviously supernatural. The unsettling sound design begins to reveal the truth; all clanking pipes and whistling winds. Hazel Doupe is terrific as quiet, introspective teenager Char, who lives with her mum Angela (Carolyn Bracken) and granny Rita (Ingrid Craigie). Their semi is decorated in the late-70s style you only now ever see in horror movies: everything in shades of brown, including a velvet sofa the colour of overbrewed tea. The scene with the baby is one of Char’s recurring dreams. Mum Angela spends most of her time in bed, medicated to blankness; she has “low days”, is how the family puts it. Something is clearly wrong – but who or what is poisoning their home? Perhaps it’s Rita, a dabbler in Irish folkore. (She looks the part of creepy horror-movie older woman, beady-eyed and a bit batty.) Or maybe its Char’s uncle Aaron (Paul Reid), who seems tense, possibly controlling. After mum Angela disappears for a few days, she returns bright and upbeat – unnervingly so. Then horrible things start to happen. Though the film ends with a pretty standard-issue horror climax, Dolan pulls off some terrifying moments using pleasingly lo-fi techniques: something revealed in a mirror that made me yelp; the sickening snap of a bone breaking; a limb twisted grotesquely. And intense performances by Doupe and Bracken give it a real emotional pulse.

2/28/2022,"No film directed by Kenneth Lonergan will ever be confused with a walk in the park: You Can Count on Me, Margaret and Manchester By the Sea all involve death and grief, but it is the latter that confronts the subject most starkly. Casey Affleck plays Lee, a janitor bonding falteringly with his teenage nephew (Lucas Hedges) following the death of his brother. Permeating everything is an unimaginable trauma from Lee’s past. Grief clings to him, closure a distant dream. In the finest moment of his Oscar-winning performance, Affleck quietly admits: “I can’t beat it. I can’t beat it. I’m sorry.” Ryan Gilbey I don’t think Riding for the Feeling from Bill Callahan’s perfect 2011 album Apocalypse is about grief exactly, but it immediately seemed that way to me when it arrived three months after I lost a loved one for the first time. It is about the difficulty of goodbyes, the impossibility of knowing someone entirely or being known that way yourself. Perhaps the best parting wisdom, our kind and calm narrator suggests, is: “Riding for the feeling.” I take it to mean living well, cherishing love and taking solace that grief is overwhelming precisely because it is approximate to how much someone meant to us. Laura Snapes How do you deal with life when death is literally all around you? That was the central question posed by Alan Ball’s masterpiece Six Feet Under. The nature of the Fisher family’s business as funeral directors meant that bereavement was an inherent and constant presence – and even if that sorrow was largely other people’s, that’s a heavy load to carry. What eventually emerged from Six Feet Under was a series of coping strategies – universal moral lessons wrenched from experiences at grief’s coal face. Along with the Fishers, viewers learned when to laugh, when to cry, when to tell a white lie, when to tell the brutal truth. A show about a family making accommodations with each other and finally, a show about them – and us – making accommodations with mortality itself. Phil Harrison Mud, spades, darkness, guns, boots, fences, rats, nipping terriers, heavy machinery, empty kitchens. Cynan Jones’s The Dig tells the intertwining stories of two rural men – a sheep farmer and a badger baiter – and their harsh, masculine world. But this is also a book about the absence of a woman – and it’s a loss you feel so powerfully it punches the air from your lungs. It’s a stark, painful reading experience – but Jones also makes room for warmth and love in this slim novella. He offers us the hope of birth and renewal alongside the despair – even if there’s no pretence that all holes can be filled. Sam Jordison In Pietà, Mary cradles her dead son’s head gently and presses her cheek to his as if trying to feel the very last warmth in his body. Their lips meet as she desperately tries to kiss him alive again. These acute observations kick you in the heart and make you see, with a cathartic surge of sorrow, the terrible fact of mortality. Grief burns the sky and turns clawing tree branches to barbed wire against the barren dawn in this expressionist howl of loss. Rogier van der Weyden, who worked in 15th-century Brussels, reaches out to us from a medieval world in which death was everywhere, to tear our souls.

2/28/2022,"Legal pressures are mounting for Donald Trump’s ex-lawyer Rudy Giuliani as the US justice department and the House panel investigating the January 6 assault on Congress are both investigating a “false electors” scheme which Giuliani reportedly helped lead to overturn Joe Biden’s 2020 election. Former prosecutors say the justice department inquiry announced last month could pose a serious legal threat to Giuliani, given his role in helping orchestrate an electoral ploy in seven states that Biden won, involving replacing slates of legitimate Democratic electors with bogus Trump slates. The false-electors scheme is under growing scrutiny by federal and state investigators as one of the avenues Trump, Giuliani and other allies deployed in their aggressive drive to subvert the election result based on debunked charges of widespread voter fraud. Giuliani, who was subpoenaed by the House panel in January and is in negotiations about providing some testimony and documents, is one of more than a dozen Trump loyalists the committee has subpoenaed who reportedly were central figures in the stealth electors’ plan to nullify Biden’s election. The fake electors stratagem was a part of Trump’s discredited and fruitless effort to persuade vice-president Mike Pence to toss out Biden’s electors and substitute bogus Republican electors when Congress met on January 6 to tally up the electoral votes. The phoney pro-Trump electoral certificates involved dozens of Trump loyalists in states such as Arizona, Georgia and Michigan and were sent to Congress in a brazen effort to thwart Biden’s certification. Some state legislators who had contacts with Giuliani as part of the scam have been subpoenaed by the panel, such as Mark Finchem in Arizona and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania, who are, respectively, running in 2022 to be secretary of state and governor in moves that raise fears of future attempts to subvert American democracy. The false-electors gambit, which the watchdog group American Oversight helped reveal, has been under scrutiny since last year by state attorneys general in Michigan and New Mexico who have looked into the role of the Trump campaign and laws that may have been broken. Michigan’s Democratic attorney general, Dana Nessel, who spent almost a year investigating 16 Republicans who submitted false certificates alleging they were the state’s presidential electors – notwithstanding Biden’s victory margin of 154,000 votes – asked federal prosecutors in January to start a criminal inquiry. Subsequently, deputy attorney general Lisa Monaco announced an inquiry into “fraudulent elector certifications”. Former justice officials say that Giuliani now has several legal problems to worry about as federal and state inquiries expand. “The threats to Giuliani come from multiple directions,” said Michael Bromwich, a former justice department inspector general. “Evidence is growing that he was at the center of a series of schemes to change the election results – by fraud and by force. As the investigations focus more closely on the people Giuliani recruited to change the election results on January 6 and before, his criminal exposure grows as the number of witnesses against him multiplies.” Other former prosecutors agree that Giuliani may be in serious legal jeopardy as the justice department proceeds with its fake electors inquiry. “If prosecutors determine that Giuliani improperly influenced or attempted to improperly influence the election, potentially, he could be charged with state and federal crimes including: falsifying voting documents, fraud, false statements, mail/wire fraud or even conspiracy to defraud the United States,” former federal prosecutor Michael Zeldin told the Guardian. For Giuliani, the latest legal threats come on top of several others that he faces due to his relentless and widely debunked efforts to help Trump win reelection. Giuliani was hit last year with a $1.3bn defamation lawsuit from Dominion Voting Systems over bogus and conspiratorial claims that Dominion helped rig the election. Dominion told a court in January there was “no realistic possibility” that it could reach a settlement with Giuliani. Separately, a Georgia special grand jury inquiry into Trump’s high pressure call on 2 January 2020 to secretary of state Brad Raffensperger asking him to just “find’ 11,780 votes to reverse Biden’s win, could ensnare Giuliani. The Fulton county district attorney who launched the inquiry has indicated it is looking into false claims that Giuliani made before a Georgia state senate committee. But the new DOJ inquiry into the fake electors strategy could pose more serious legal threats to Giuliani, say ex-prosecutors, since he served as Trump’s right hand man and was involved with multiple schemes to overturn the election results. “Giuliani was the cog of Trump’s flywheel to overturn the election, getting other Trump allies to act and leaving his imprint for investigators to find,” said former federal prosecutor Dennis Aftergut. “He’s reportedly key in the bogus slate scheme. That’s dangerous for Giuliani, because forgeries disprove innocent intent. In a conspiracy, which DOJ could charge as to the fake electors, a conviction doesn’t require that he solicited, or even knew about the forgeries, but only that he participated in a conspiratorial plot involving fake electors to help overturn the election.” The drive to assemble illegitimate electors occurred in December 2020 and was conducted state by state with the involvement of some Trump campaign officials and supporters, and reportedly spearheaded by Giuliani. Michigan attorney general Nessel told Rachel Maddow of MSNBC that under state law “you have a forgery of a public record, which is a 14-year offense, and election law forgery, which is a five-year offense.” She alleged a “coordinated effort” by Republican parties in several states which prompted her request to DOJ to open a federal inquiry. “Obviously this is part of a much bigger conspiracy,” Nessel said. The House January 6 panel seems to share those views. Last month the committee subpoenaed Giuliani and three other Trump allies he worked closely with on multiple fronts to overturn the election results by promoting baseless charges of widespread voter fraud. “The four individuals we’ve subpoenaed today advanced unsupported theories about election fraud, pushed efforts to overturn the election results, or were in direct contact with the former President about attempts to stop the counting of electoral votes,” Democratic representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, said in a January statement. Congressman Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republican members on the House panel, in February told CBS’ Face the Nation that “we fully expect that, in accordance with the law, we’ll hear from Rudy.” Giuliani’s lawyer Robert Costello told the Guardian that talks with the panel are ongoing, but would not offer any details, and scoffed at the justice department investigation into the fake elector certificates. Facing a subpoena and the prospect of a criminal referral to DOJ from the House panel if he doesn’t cooperate, Giuliani could wind up as a crucial witness. “Giuliani’s information about various schemes that Trump promoted to block Biden’s win could potentially be very helpful to the House inquiry,” Zeldin noted. “If Rudy provides significant cooperation (which is unlikely) he could help the panel unravel some of the major ways that Trump tried to thwart Biden’s election victory including, most significantly, whether there was any coordination or pre-planning between Trump and those who stormed the US Capitol.” Still, other ex-prosecutors say the fake electors scheme offers a rich target for investigators to unravel that could spell significant trouble for Giuliani. “For Giuliani and his crew to have legal trouble, you don’t have to get much more into the facts than to understand that he was orchestrating fake slates of electors, based on fake reports of fraud, using faked documents, to fake the outcome of the election, and then submitting those fake documents to government officials,” said Michael Moore, a former US attorney in Georgia. “That is a conspiracy that a kindergartener could unravel,” Moore added. “The submission of the pro-Trump fake elector certificates to the National Archives was about as smart as taking the note that you used to rob the bank to the frame shop.”",News/US news,Giuliani’s legal problems deepen as ‘false electors’ scheme investigated,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/28/rudy-giuliani-legal-problems-false-electors-scheme
2/28/2022,"So much about being single is great: being able to eat, watch and do what you want; independence; no in-laws. But routine can easily turn into a rut, which makes life difficult if you want to find a relationship. We asked the experts how you might go about shaking things up. It is easy to mistake a presence on dating apps with putting yourself out there. Unless you make an effort to meet people, apps can soon become a time-suck. Annie Lord, a dating columnist for Vogue whose memoir Notes on Heartbreak will be published in June, recommends using them at a particular time, “rather than spending every evening just scrolling”, and making a plan to meet any promising matches as soon as possible. Many people have profiles just for the ego boost, Lord says. “If you haven’t arranged a date within 48 hours of talking, it’s never going to happen. You can overthink it, or procrastinate. If you’ve had one OK conversation, you should probably just meet them.” Given that an app is marketing its user base, it also pays to try a few; the Tinder experience – and crowd – is different from the Bumble one, for example. It is also normal, even advisable, to delete and re-download with your changing enthusiasms. Jo, 45, used apps on and off for about five years after her marriage ended, when she was 34. “I was a bit wary, but I slowly learned that it’s a lot of luck – and not to take anything personally from someone you’ve never met.” She met someone last year. Her top tips are to limit your activity and take months-long breaks. On her last venture on the dating scene, she swiped for no more than 10 minutes, a few times a week. It is tempting to try to maximise your matches, or search online for icebreakers or opening lines – but if you are looking for love, it is better to emphasise what is unique about you. (It won’t be your position on Hawaiian pizza.) Mark Manson, the author of the bestselling self-help series The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, advocates emphasising your quirks to appeal to the 10% of people who will think you are fascinating and fun, instead of downplaying them for the 90% who will think you are merely fine. If you are not sure of your best or defining traits, ask a friend. The same goes for what you are looking for: if you want a long-term relationship, or to be friends first, don’t be afraid to say so. The only people you will put off will be those who want something different. But emphasise what you do want, not what you don’t want: positive, upbeat profiles get more messages and matches. Getting a second opinion on your profile doesn’t hurt. Jo says her partner’s profile stood out for its detailed description of his interests, which made it easy for her to ask questions, and several decent photographs (not selfies). “He told me later that a female friend helped him.” Logan Ury, a behavioural scientist turned dating coach and the author of How to Not Die Alone, says people tend to fall into one of three categories: the romanticiser, chasing a fairytale; the maximiser, with a checklist, always out for the next best match; and the hesitator, who is seeking reasons not to start looking. Instead, Ury suggests cultivating a “growth mindset”. If you see each date as a learning opportunity, it becomes less decisive. Apps make it easy to be overprescriptive about a potential partner, but it is impossible to gauge chemistry or compatibility from a profile. If you are curious about someone, meet them. “We’re so quick to judge,” says the comedian Katerina Robinson, 28. She ended up matched with a long list of tall, bearded project managers (“my type”) before recently having her horizons broadened by a BDSM enthusiast she met through work. “If you don’t keep an open mind, you’ll always end up dating different versions of the same person and never find out what you actually like.” Pre-pandemic, meeting for the first time for a walk or on a video call would have been exceptional; now, all bets are off. Take advantage and arrange a date that you truly want to go on. (For women in particular, being proactive tends to be rewarded, OkCupid data shows.) You might find dating becomes less daunting and easier to fit in. “Keep a first date short – and weekdays only. Don’t waste your weekend on a stranger,” says Jessica. Prefer to test for a spark on a phone or video call before meeting in person? Since lockdown, many dating platforms have introduced calling functionality, so you don’t have to give out your number. Sensuality might not figure into your life as a single person, even if you have a healthy sex life. Kate Moyle, a psychosexual therapist and the host of the podcast The Sexual Wellness Sessions, says it is important not to neglect the importance of touch – if only your own. “Building on the relationship with yourself and your body is not partner-dependent,” she says. “Take time to touch and explore your body, getting to know yourself and what you like – not just in terms of sexual pleasure, but in terms of sensuality and all-over body touch.” Not only can this help to build your own body confidence, it can support you in communicating with a new partner, says Moyle. Ury recommends establishing a pre-date ritual, such as calling a supportive friend or playing a favourite song, to help you approach the date “from a place of optimism and possibility”. According to a 2020 YouGov survey, only one in 20 Britons in their 20s met their current or most recent partner “out and about” – at a gig, bar or bookshop, for example – versus one in five aged 50 to 64. The fear of embarrassment and rejection makes swiping across screens much more attractive than approaching strangers in public – yet, for many, an old-fashioned “meet cute” remains the gold standard. Also, if we never return to the office full-time, another time-honoured path to romance will be diminished. Lord says the direct approach is due a comeback: “I’ve been out recently and managed to talk to guys in bars in ways that I thought didn’t exist any more.” She relates it to the pandemic: “Everyone is so desperate for human contact. If you’re feeling a little bit awkward, it’s all right, because everyone is in the same boat.” Instead of an obvious come-on, she suggests being friendly and striking up a conversation. “There’s less of a risk factor if you can find common ground that will make it seem less intrusive, and you’re not going to feel rejected if the conversation stops.” If flirting seems foreign, keep it light, says Jean Smith, a “flirt coach” and the author of Flirtology: Stop Swiping, Start Talking and Find Love: “You’ll soon find it’s not as scary as you imagined. Just go up and say hi.” Many men are afraid of asking out women for fear of being seen as sleazy – but if your intentions are not sleazy, and you are sensitive to others and to the situation, it may be worth the fleeting discomfort. “If you’re really attracted to a woman and think the vibe is right, but you’re scared to ask her out, ask yourself: ‘What’s the worst that could happen?’” says Kieran, 26. “Then walk yourself concretely through that worst-case scenario.” If it is nothing more than a polite no and some mild embarrassment, he says “shoot your shot – send a DM or ask her for a drink like you’re ripping off a plaster. And if the answer is anything other than a resounding yes, take it as a no – and live to try another day.” In my experience, the difference between a cynical come-on and a genuine compliment, offered without expectation, is like night and day. “Everyone has that friend who likes to slightly embarrass you and set you up with people when you’re out,” says Lord. “You’re like: ‘Oh, stop it’ – but secretly grateful.” Also, if it backfires, “you can always put the blame on them”. Partnered people, in particular, love to hear dating stories. Put them to work by asking them to set you up with a single friend or colleague, or engineer an introduction to a stranger. Combining groups can often be less intimidating. “Don’t be afraid to be the third wheel,” agrees Aaron, 42. When he went to a bar recently with coupled-up friends, they got talking to another couple, who thought Aaron might be a match for one of their friends. “They tried to get us to do a FaceTime date.” Chemistry and compatibility are not always aligned. If you find yourself consistently attracted to traits that work against you – such as emotional unavailability – it is possible to heal through therapy or self-reflection. “Try to focus on how you want to feel, rather than fixed attributes or characteristics that you think will make you happy,” says Moyle. Our concept of what is desirable in a partner, and what we should look for, is informed by factors we may not even be aware of, she says. “Considering or challenging these messages could be a really positive thing. In fact, feeling satisfied, intimate and connected may look different to how we imagined.” Lizzie Cernik, who has interviewed many couples for the Guardian’s How we met column, says it can be helpful to reflect on your “attachment style” – your approach to intimate relationships, established in childhood. “Don’t look for what you want in a partner and try to tick boxes – look for what you need,” she says. “The two can be very different.” Unless the first date was truly disastrous, Ury is in favour of a second. We tend to see people’s flaws first, which means we may mistake pet peeves for dealbreakers. As for the fabled spark, it is a terrible measure of compatibility, she says: “Chemistry can build over time.” Making two dates your default minimum helps to unearth deeper points of connection, such as values and long-term goals, and “give more people a chance”, says Ury. How your date makes you feel – understood, dismissed, desirable, drained? – is a better measure than butterflies. Even after a good date, it is easy to catastrophise about the future. “If something feels good, just appreciate it for what it is and go with it,” says Lord. “Don’t worry about whether they would get on with your family, or are the ‘kind of person’ you could see as your girlfriend. You have to give yourself a chance to see whether you like them. That isn’t leading someone on, or a bad thing to do.” That said, it is helpful to know which lines you won’t cross, such as political differences or ambivalence about children. “Particularly when it comes to shared relationship goals, if you’re not on the same page, it’s unlikely that will change,” says Olivia, 34. “Don’t get too caught up on people who don’t match what you’re looking for – it saves a lot of time and energy.” Generally, anyone who demonstrates controlling or problematic behaviour, is consistently poor at communicating or does not meet your effort equally “is probably worth walking away from”, Olivia says. Smith gets her clients to list “five fundamentals” on which they won’t compromise: “It helps you weed out any time-wasters.” As soon as you are confident that there is no future, it is kind to communicate it, even if you have had only one or two dates. It may be tempting to ghost the person, but Ury says it will only make you feel bad about yourself and depressed about dating. She recommends sending a short, polite message such as: “I don’t think we’re a romantic fit.” (You can lessen the sting of sending it by saving a template on your phone.) If you receive such a message, Lord says, try not to take it to heart: “There are so many reasons why they might not want to be with you that probably don’t have anything to do with you.” Allow yourself to be excited about your next date: “Life would be so depressing if you didn’t have hope.” It is common for single people to be told to “work on themselves”, or to learn to be content on their own before they go looking for love. But it is perfectly fine to want to be in a romantic relationship as you are. Sure, you will probably be a better, more secure partner if you have some awareness of your relationship history and patterns. But love is not a marathon for which you have to train, as our societal fixation with self-improvement and personal responsibility can suggest. Jenny, 25, says longtime single friends, seeking to reassure her, will often labour the advantages of single life. “I think: that’s wonderful for you – but there are days when all I want is a cuddle or someone to make dinner with,” she says. “Being able to admit that you want companionship and romance is healthy and, I believe, helpful when it comes to being single. It’s OK to have those days, as long as you are able to pick yourself up and keep going.” Jenny says learning to open up and be vulnerable with friends has helped: “Being able to share your wants, desires and goals in life is a huge part of a romantic relationship – but friendships are also a loving relationship, just in a different way.” It is easy to feel the pressure – from friends or family, or our couple-centric culture – to “put yourself out there”, but no one gains from you going on dates you don’t fancy. “Only date when you’re enjoying it,” says Alison. “Doing it for the sake of it will zap the joy from your life and take away much-needed energy reserves.” A break can also bring clarity and perspective. Elena, 32, stopped dating after she realised that she had not healed from negative experiences in past relationships. “I realised that a lot of dating tropes – when do you text them back, when do you have sex with them, how do you not ‘scare them off’? – were triggering for me, so I opted out for a while.” The pause gave her a chance to appreciate her life. “I’m doing great on my own – and realising that has made dating a lot less stressful,” she says. “Why do I need to find ‘the one’ when I’m quite happy with myself and my life?” Kayleigh, 30, agrees: “You can be in total control of your happiness, with no compromises. Want to go to the cinema? You can. Fancy a trip away? Book it! Want to eat pizza in your PJs at 11am? No judgment! It’s super-freeing!” Jen, 37, says: “I’ve done more dining, travelling and embarking on adventures alone in the last two years than ever before.” Being single through the pandemic, she learned to accept all parts of herself, including those she had previously disliked or shied away from. The experience has been life-changing, she says: “I know myself in ways I never thought possible.” Now, she says, “I would so much rather be solo than in an unfulfilling relationship – when one is single, the possibilities are unlimited”.

2/28/2022,"On some days Marilyn Datillo, a vaccine nurse, used to see 900 people enter Mercy Covid Vaccine Clinic in Kirkwood, a St Louis suburb. Now, she said sometimes less than 20 people visit the clinic in one day – even though only 55% of Missouri residents are fully vaccinated and just 22% are boosted. When someone does show up to get vaccinated, “you celebrate”, Datillo said. But she and infectious disease doctors do not anticipate many more people suddenly deciding to get their first shot – or ending delays on second shots and boosters – amid declining numbers of Covid cases and hospitalizations in the US; the lifting of vaccine mandates and other restrictions; and some talk of the end of the pandemic being in view. The number of new people getting vaccinated in America has steadily declined in recent months, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. The seven-day average of new vaccinations now mirrors the rates from December 2020, when there was only a limited supply of the vaccines. But doctors emphasize that the virus remains a threat in the US and that people who are not vaccinated are at greater risk of become severely ill or dying. They point to the fact that the seven-day average of new cases on 23 February in the United States was 76,667, according to the New York Times data. On 23 February last year, the seven-day average was 67,854. The seven-day average of deaths on those dates were also not much different: 1,908 and 2,056. “I can think back to just last week when I had to put someone on a breathing machine who was unvaccinated, so this continues to be with us,” said Dr Anuj Mehta, a pulmonologist with Denver Health in Colorado, where 69% of people are fully vaccinated and 34% boosted. Even though the number of cases and hospitalizations have plummeted since the height of the Omicron surge, Mehta continues to worry because new variants will emerge “until we get the entire world vaccinated”, he said. “I could imagine a time this summer or fall” when people who “tested positive for Covid in the last three months will think that they have ongoing immunity, and I think that’s not true”, said Mehta. But Mehta admits that he is unsure whether it’s realistic that the whole world will get vaccinated. He said he is encouraged by the development of a new Covid vaccine that does not need to be stored at as cold of temperature as existing ones and thus could make it easier to vaccinate much of the world. “We need to push forward on that and help as a global community member to achieve that goal, which in turn will help protect the United States,” said Mehta. Dr Farrin Manian, an infectious disease specialist and chair of the department of medicine at Mercy Hospital St Louis, conceded that there are people who aren’t going to change their minds about vaccination. But in talking with patients, he still encounters some who are open to it. “I think we just need to talk about what has happened in the last year and hopefully get people to change their minds and honestly discuss the effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing hospitalizations,” said Manian. Mehta also thinks there could be more opportunities for conversations about the vaccines because so many people skipped primary care during the pandemic and will hopefully now return to see their doctors. A January poll from the University of Michigan Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation found that among older adults, only about half of the unvaccinated had rescheduled a primary care appointment that was disrupted by the pandemic in 2021, compared with 85% of those who were boosted and 74% of those who were vaccinated. “We would have a slight increase in the rates of boosting and vaccines in general if people were to have a real conversation with an individual provider,” said Mehta. “Seeing patients in the clinic with lung disease, I am far more likely to convince somebody to get the vaccine when I am talking to them in person.” “When I ask them why they don’t want to, they cite everything they see on Facebook, and I am able to counter that in an individual appointment, when they are there to check in on their asthma or their COPD,” he added. Datillo, the vaccine nurse, still encounters people who only decided to get vaccinated after losing a loved one who also wasn’t vaccinated. And people who didn’t get a vaccine because they were concerned about its impact on their ability to have children. Or people who initially didn’t get a booster because, they said, “I got Covid anyway, and I was sick, so why bother getting the booster?” Datillo is, of course, only seeing them because they eventually decided to get the shot, but most people’s “judgement has been made”, she said. If that’s the case, people who have not gotten a booster or people whose immunity from an infection has waned could “become more suspectable to severe disease”, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health. “I do think it’s of the utmost importance that we keep an eye on the virus over the summer and don’t assume that everything that’s going to happen is in the rearview mirror.”",News/US news,New Covid vaccinations drop in US as cases and hospitalizations decline,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/28/us-new-covid-vaccinations-decline-cases-hospitalizations-drop
2/28/2022,"Matt Hancock has insisted that he broke only Covid guidelines rather than rules in kissing his aide and friend in his ministerial office, events that forced his resignation as UK health secretary after CCTV images of the clinch emerged. Hancock also said his decision to step down more than 24 hours after the pictures were published was made after people he knew and respected got in touch to remind him they had been unable to see dying relatives because of Covid regulations. He resigned in June last year after CCTV footage was leaked to the Sun showing him kissing his closest aide, Gina Coladangelo, in his personal office. In a lengthy interview for the podcast Diary of a CEO, Hancock made the distinction that he did not believe he had broken any legally set rules, although he accepted it was inevitable he had to step down. “I resigned because I broke the social distance in guidelines then,” he said. “They weren’t actually rules. They weren’t the law. But that’s not the point. The point is they were the guidelines that I’d been proposing.” He added: “It actually happened after … the rules were lifted, but the guidance was still in place. So I’m not trying to claim that I hold no bitterness about this because I broke the rules, I fess up, I broke the guidance, and there were only two people responsible for this.” It happened, he said, “because I fell in love with somebody,” describing Coladangelo, a close personal and family friend before they began a relationship, as someone he had known “for more than half of my life”. Hancock has left his wife, with whom he has three children, to live with Coladangelo. The PR and lobbying manager, who at the time was a non-executive director at the health department, is also married with three children. “I brought her into the department to help with public communications,” Hancock told the podcast. “And so we spent a lot of time together, ironically, trying to get me to be able to communicate in a more emotionally intelligent way. “And we fell in love. And that’s something that was completely outside of my control. And of course, I regret the pain that that’s caused and the very, very, very public nature. Anybody who’s been through this knows how difficult it is, how painful it is doing that in public is incredibly painful, but I fell in love with someone.” Hancock told the podcast that his decision to resign was not necessarily a result of the intense media pressure: “It was that some people I really respect got in contact and told me about things that they had been not able to do.” Asked to explain, he said: “Like seeing dying relatives. And … I realised that it was unsustainable.” The release of the CCTV images “caused a huge amount of pain”, Hancock said: “Anybody knows how difficult it is ending a relationship, and we have six children. It’s tough. But Gina and I love each other very deeply.” Hancock said he still did not know how CCTV images from his personal office were leaked and that he knew nothing about the progress of an investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office. He said: “The thing that we’ve learned, and I think all my other colleagues in cabinet learned immediately, is why did you have a CCTV in the secretary of state’s office? Obviously, I didn’t know about it because even who’s in the office is an important fact and a sensitive piece of information.”",News/World news,"I didn’t break Covid rules when kissing aide, says Matt Hancock",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/28/i-didnt-break-covid-rules-when-kissing-aide-says-matt-hancock-gina-coladangelo

2/28/2022,"The UK government could expand its revised entry rules for Ukrainian nationals, criticised as overly limited, the defence secretary has hinted, saying ministers would examine a more generous EU plan in the coming days. “We need to reflect on what Europe announced with the refugee crisis yesterday,” Ben Wallace told BBC One’s Breakfast programme. “We will keep all the measures under review.” Under plans set out on Sunday evening and due to be announced to parliament later, Ukrainian nationals settled in the UK will be able to bring their “immediate family members” to join them. Subsequent Home Office guidance said the visas were available only to spouses, unmarried partners of at least two years, parents or their children if one is under 18, or adult relatives who are also carers. The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, called the offer “shameful”, arguing that in practice brothers or sisters of Ukrainians settled in the UK might not be eligible. While saying he could not definitively say more would be done, Wallace argued the UK had been generous to Hong Kong and Afghan nationals and would look at its policy in the light of the EU’s decision to consider accepting all Ukrainian nationals for up to three years. “Obviously we will reflect on what the EU has announced, and look at how we can help Ukraine more,” Wallace said. “What is going to be announced today is the start of that process. “It was only announced yesterday. I think good policy is made in analysis and studying of what that means. We are open to all sorts of suggestions about how we can help people from Ukraine. We’ll reflect on that, we’ll look at the announcement this afternoon, and I know [home secretary] Priti Patel and the prime minister are absolutely certain that we have to lean in and support Ukrainians, whatever that means. “Let’s look at those details from Europe and then we will be able to discuss what comes next in our policy.” Wallace warned the fighting in Ukraine could become notably more brutal, with Russian forces suffering reverses. “This is the overwhelming scale of the Russian Federation army up against Ukraine,” he said. “They are behind schedule, they are taking significant casualties, and they are feeling public rejection in parts of the Russian system itself – we’ve seen many protests. “But the Russian handbook is to then get more violent and commit more forces. Because fundamentally, in the Russia doctrine, the lives of their own soldiers matter much less than in other armed forces. “We have to brace ourselves for what may come next, which could be ruthless, indiscriminate bombing of cities, and the propelling forward of soldiers and high casualty levels. And that’s going to be horrific.” Wallace warned against panic after Vladimir Putin on Sunday ordered his military to put Russia’s nuclear deterrence forces on high alert – while saying his own 12-year-old son had phoned him, worried, to ask about this. “We don’t see or recognise in the phrase or the status he described anything that is a change to what they have currently as their nuclear posture,” Wallace said. “This is predominantly about Putin putting it on the table, just to remind the world that he has a deterrent. “By entering this into the conversation yesterday he did two things. He reminded people he’s got nuclear weapons, which starts to set off people being worried. But secondly he distracted from what’s going wrong in Ukraine.” Wallace’s comments came as the Treasury said the UK would strengthen sanctions by targeting Russia’s central bank. The government would “take all necessary steps to bring into effect restrictions to prohibit any UK natural or legal persons from undertaking financial transactions involving the [Russian central bank], the Russian national wealth fund, and the ministry of finance of the Russian Federation”, the Treasury said.",News/UK news,UK could expand revised visa rules for Ukrainians after criticism,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/28/uk-government-could-expand-revised-entry-rules-ukrainians
2/28/2022,"‘It’s a little like Sliding Doors,” says the actor and cabaret artist Bridget Everett, speaking from Manhattan, New York. She’s talking about her new dramedy Somebody Somewhere, which is set in Manhattan, Kansas. “Basically, what life might be like if I had stayed in Kansas and never moved to New York and found my voice.” I feel I ought to point out that Somebody Somewhere is nothing like Sliding Doors. Everett plays Sam, a subdued, laconic woman, sometimes depressed, sometimes just not feeling it. She has a quiet life and a gigantic voice, which she slowly comes around to unleashing in the drab community centres and church halls where thwarted, flamboyant people find one another. The drama doesn’t so much centre on Sam as move stealthily from one understated struggle to another: Sam and her sister’s grief at losing their other sister; their mother’s alcoholism, which, like bankruptcy, moves first slowly and then very fast. It’s poignant, haunting, and funny in ways that mean you sometimes don’t laugh until two days later. To say the show was about disappointment would be too simple, and misleadingly bleak, but part of what makes it so unusual is the richness it finds in a life that drama might ordinarily overlook – that of a person, Everett says, who has “floated through life in their 20s, 30s, 40s and just given up”. The HBO series is called “semi-autobiographical”, but “semi” doesn’t exactly cover it. Everett, like her character, grew up in Manhattan, Kansas, and spent years waiting for a break. “I had a couple of failures early on and let that be the litmus test of what was possible for me. I slipped into a life of waiting tables and staring at walls – for 20 years. More. From maybe when I was 14 till I was in my 40s.” Everett is flattening the picture a bit: there was a bit more to those years. While she was “pretty settled, watching my friends succeed and just being their cheerleader, there was something inside me that really missed music, missed singing. Once a week, we would go to a karaoke bar and I would go wilder and wilder and wilder. I’d start with a microphone and, by the end, I would be on the bar, ripping my shirt open, throwing Jack Daniel’s at the crowd.” In one way, it didn’t matter whether it was a karaoke bar or Madison Square Garden. “There’s something about singing,” she says. “I feel really plugged in and electrified. When I was little, my family – we didn’t communicate well, but the one time we really experienced joy was around the holidays, when every day would be drinking and singing. My sister would pour me a glass of Blue Nun. And I would be so happy then. There’s something I cling to about that.” Everett wasn’t wasted in karaoke – she just had a talent karaoke couldn’t contain. So in the early 00s, a friend who ran a tiny theatre asked her to turn her weekend wildness into a cabaret act. It’s a niche art: it’s not comedy, it’s not musical theatre, there’s no such thing as “mainstream” cabaret. It wasn’t a fast track to fame. “Cabaret doesn’t pay as well as some people might think,” Everett says drily. “So I still had to hustle to keep the roof over my head and buy the occasional bottle of chardonnay.” It was, however, a passport to something: “A lot of my stuff was rock, because I originally wanted to be a rock singer. I just had to figure out how to get the stage time. When I was encouraged to write an act, I stepped into my voice more. I have a bunch of songs about various parts of the anatomy. I think you should sing what you know – and what I know is different kinds of tits.” So perhaps it was quite cult and subversive, and only just managed to keep the wolf from the door, but Everett’s act by the late 00s was pretty established. She’d open for the comedian Amy Schumer, and had piqued the interest of various film producers. In 2008, she featured as an incredibly drunk woman in the Sex and the City movie. “I thought, ‘Oh my God, I’m in a movie now. My life is going to change.’ But life just does not fucking work out that way. I was waiting tables for at least another 10 years.” Everett had to be dragged kicking and screaming into an audition for the 2017 US indie film Patti Cake$, because by that time she had a reputation. “It takes an incredible amount of confidence and courage for me to get up on stage and give myself away. The shows are very personal. I talk about my body – there are a lot of tender moments. I’d worked hard to feel like I belonged there. I thought if I got to Sundance and stank the whole place up, that’s going to rock my confidence.” Cabaret is, she says, “much more embraced in London and Sydney. But in New York, there’s a whole cabaret counterculture – people doing things that are very subversive and wild.” Maybe everybody in showbiz is the black sheep of their family, unless they’re part of a dynasty. But Everett is drawn – in Somebody Somewhere – to the question of what remains of family relationships; which part of the black sheep is still very attached to the other sheep. The show isn’t directly true to life in all its details: Everett is one of six, while Sam, her character, just has two sisters. They’re similar but not identical, and the show is less raucous than the stage act. “If people knew what I was like when I’m not on stage,” says Everett, “they’d think Sam made sense. I can be a little depressive. We constantly talked about how much to Bridget-ise Sam, how much to bring in the raunchy lyrics or the dirty side. Sam is not me but there are parts of me in her.” There is one crucial parallel though: both Everett and her character have lost a sister. “Families work because everybody has their role. Lose one cog and the whole thing can fall apart. ” In the drama, Sam and her sister Trisha try to overcome their differences: Trisha is uptight, judgmental, godly, homophobic; Sam is surly, avoidant, alienated. But they can’t make it work without their late sister Holly. Instead, they have to change how they are. Everett has said she didn’t want Somebody Somewhere to be one of those dramas where people grow. And, yes, it is a cliche when a character goes on a journey – but that’s what a drama is. She modifies her position a bit: “It was important for me to not have Sam grow because of a romantic relationship. I feel like I’ve seen that 1,000 times. That’s not been my experience and I just didn’t want to do it.” Somebody Somewhere just had the green light for a second season and Everett has, I suggest, pulled off something impressive: she got her big break with a complicated, unconventional show at an age – 49 – when female performers are expected to step out of the limelight and rejoin the chorus. “When you put it that way, I want to give myself a high five,” she says. But Everett’s just not that good at even the most fleeting self-congratulation. “I watch the show alone. I don’t like to be around other people when I’m watching myself. The HBO label comes on, that static sound. I don’t believe it’s me. It’s hard to grasp that I might have achieved something. It’s hard to sit with that. It’s a midwestern thing – to keep your head down, keep working and hope for the best.”  Somebody Somewhere is on HBO Max in the US, Binge/Foxtel Now in Australia and begins on Sky Comedy in the UK in March.",Arts/Television & radio,‘I’d rip open my shirt and throw Jack Daniel’s at the crowd’ – how Bridget Everett went from waitress to superstar,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/28/bridget-everett-interview-somebody-somewhere-hbo-cabaret
