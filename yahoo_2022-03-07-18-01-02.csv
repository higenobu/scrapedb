3/7/2022,"NEWARK, N.J.—Outraged by the invasion of Ukraine, lawmakers in New Jersey's largest city lashed out at one of the closest symbols of Russia they could find—a pair of Lukoil gas stations. The Newark City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to ask the city’s business administrator to suspend the service stations' operating licenses, citing Lukoil's base in Moscow. In doing so, however, they may have predominantly been hurting Americans. The stations are franchises owned by locals, not Russians. They employ mostly New Jersey residents. And the gasoline sold at the stations comes from a local Phillips 66 refinery. The campaign targeting the gas stations is one example of collateral damage from the backlash against Russia, as government officials and customers race to show their support for Ukraine by boycotting products and companies—or things they perceive to be Russian. Roger Verma, a New Jersey resident who immigrated from India 45 years ago, has owned the franchise for one of the Lukoil stations in Newark since 2005. He said the decision to yank his license left him baffled and concerned that he could be put out of business, which would affect his 16 employees. “Let me be clear that I stand with Ukraine and I’m fully in support of Russian sanctions,” Verma said Wednesday in front of Newark’s City Hall. “But I’m baffled and confused how people sitting in these positions without having any of their facts together and without having full knowledge of how things are done can introduce and change laws and change people’s lives just like that.” In some places, people have been pouring out Smirnoff vodka, not realizing that the beverage is owned by an English company and the bottles consumed in the U.S. are distilled in Illinois. Charlie Tgibedes, owner of Box Seats, a restaurant and sports bar in North Attleboro, Mass., told The Sun Chronicle newspaper he’s not ordering more vodka from Russian companies but questioned the wisdom of tossing what he already has. “It looks good doing it, but the stuff is already in the building and paid for. You’re just hurting yourself dumping it down the drain,” he said. On social media, people have called for boycotts of Lukoil stations, which operate in 11 states, mainly in the northeastern U.S. Newark officials said going after the Lukoil stations was the moral thing to do, even if they are locally owned. “All of us are horrified by the images we’re seeing” from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Council Member Anibal Ramos said Wednesday. “Today Newark is standing in solidarity with a number of countries around the world who are supporting democracy and taking sanctions against the Russian federation.” A phone message couldn’t be left at a listing for Lukoil Americas Corp. in New York. In a statement posted on its website Thursday, Lukoil's board of directors expressed “its deepest concerns about the tragic events in Ukraine” and called for “the soonest termination of the armed conflict.” “We express our sincere empathy for all victims, who are affected by this tragedy. We strongly support a lasting ceasefire and a settlement of problems through serious negotiations and diplomacy,” it said. It wasn't immediately clear Thursday when the Newark stations' licenses would be revoked, or if the city administrator might halt the suspension. Ramos, who introduced the resolution, said he anticipated it would still happen. Under a typical Lukoil franchise agreement, the company acts as the station’s landlord. The station pays rent, taxes and utilities to the company and also agrees to buy a certain amount of fuel each month. Sal Risalvato, executive director of New Jersey Gasoline, Convenience Store and Automotive Association, called the crackdown on the stations “nothing more than political theater.” “All of the station owners condemn what Russia is doing in Ukraine, but do not deserve to lose their businesses and their investments because of Russia’s bad behavior,” Risalvato wrote in an email. Ramos said the license suspension in Newark is meant to be temporary and his office had received calls from employers offering to give jobs to any affected gas station workers.

3/7/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and impending Federal Reserve rate hikes have given stock traders in Asia a lot to contend with already. Their next challenge is to navigate a spate of elections across the region.

South Koreans go to the ballot box on Wednesday to choose a new leader in the first presidential election in five years. The coming months will also see Philippine voters elect a successor to President Rodrigo Duterte, with the son of the country’s former dictator leading the polls. Australia may have its sixth prime minister in a decade in polls likely in May, while Japan’s Fumio Kishida faces another test at upper house elections in summer. Asia’s stock benchmark has slumped more than 7% this year, clobbered by China’s regulatory crackdowns and a implosion in tech shares with the Fed set to embark on a tightening path. The measure has slightly outperformed global stocks. Here’s a look at what the most prominent races in the Asia-Pacific region mean for markets. South Korea: March 9 Investors are on tenterhooks with the two leading candidates neck-and-neck in the March 9 poll to choose a successor to President Moon Jae-in. Both are courting Korea’s growing horde of retail traders. The ruling Democratic Party’s Lee Jae-myung has promised to end tax on securities transactions, and wants the country’s pension fund to buy more stocks. His rival Yoon Suk-yeol of the People Power Party wants to end capital gains tax on share sales. Both promise to build millions of apartments. Here Are the Contenders to Be South Korea’s Next President A win for Lee may boost renewable energy and stocks involved in space technology. Former top prosecutor Yoon is seen as favorable for nuclear power stocks, but his call for deeper ties with the U.S. and expansion of the Thaad missile shield could hurt shares of companies sensitive to Chinese spending. Hong Kong: May 8 With Hong Kong experiencing its worst Covid-19 outbreak, the election for chief executive has been postponed to May 8. No major officials, including incumbent Carrie Lam, have announced their candidacy yet. Hong Kong Chief Executive Delays Election to Fill Her Own Post The city’s leader is selected by an elite group of 1,500, so market impact is likely to be incremental. Stocks are more likely to be impacted by Covid restrictions and currency woes as the Fed tightens, but attention will be on who registers their candidacy, with speculation some heavy-hitters from the financial sector may run. Philippines: May 9 The May 9 election to succeed Duterte will be the sixth presidential elections since dictator Ferdinand Marcos was ousted in 1986, and the front-runner in this one is his son Ferdinand Marcos Jr., a former senator and governor. Rivals include boxer-turned-Senator Manny Pacquiao and economists’ favorite, Vice President Leni Robredo. How Another Marcos Could Win Power in the Philippines: QuickTake The poll is likely to boost stocks as campaign spending ramps up, with the benchmark Philippine Stock Exchange Index performing well before and after past presidential elections. While economic policies haven’t featured heavily in public debate, largess from candidates helps to add a tailwind to gross domestic product of 1-2% during election years, according to Cristina Ulang, an analyst at First Metro Investment Corp. Australia: By May 21 Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has led the country since 2018, will face off against the Labor Party’s Anthony Albanese by May 21. A date has yet to be set. Morrison, who is highlighting the strong economy and promises of future tax cuts, is performing poorly in the polls amid dissatisfaction with his government’s handling of the pandemic. Why Australia’s Leader Is Hoping for Second ‘Miracle’: QuickTake Albanese is keeping the focus on the government’s failings rather than Labor policies, but Morrison pulled off a surprise win at the 2019 election, spurring rallies in banking, real estate and health-insurance shares. Japan: June/July Kishida’s government faces upper house elections after the new leader beat higher profile contenders for the top job in the ruling party late last year. A win would cement his position atop the Liberal Democratic Party and allow him to begin implementing his vision of “new capitalism,” which investors fret could include higher capital gains taxes. While he is little-loved by markets, spending ahead of the vote could be supportive. Japan’s Kishida Says Profits Should Flow to More Stakeholders Kishida will seek to boost the economy by implementing an already-approved 36 trillion yen ($312 billion) extra budget ahead of the vote, SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. Chief Economist Junichi Makino wrote. Travel subsidies will likely be revived ahead of May holidays as virus restrictions are lifted -- something sure to boost shares in reopening stocks. And more... That’s just the main races, with political risks for traders in destinations such as India, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces state elections that are underway, and Thailand set for gubernatorial elections by mid-year. And while one-party China faces no election risk, there will be intense focus on the 20th Party Congress toward the end of the year, when Xi Jinping is expected seek a third term as leader.

3/7/2022,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Jarrett Renshaw WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States and European allies are exploring banning imports of Russian oil, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday, and the White House coordinated with key Congressional committees moving forward with their own ban. Europe relies on Russia for crude oil and natural gas but has become more open to the idea of banning Russian products in the past 24 hours, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters on Sunday. Meanwhile, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi also said in a Sunday letter that the chamber is ""exploring"" legislation to ban the import of Russian oil and that Congress intends to enact this week $10 billion in aid for Ukraine in response to Moscow's military invasion of its neighbour. The White House is also talking with the Senate Finance Committee and House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee about a potential ban, the source said. Still, Blinken also stressed the importance of maintaining steady oil supplies globally. ""We are now in very active discussions with our European partners about banning the import of Russian oil to our countries, while of course, at the same time, maintaining a steady global supply of oil,"" Blinken said in an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" show. Blinken, who is on a trip across Europe to coordinate with allies the response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, also said he discussed oil imports with President Joe Biden and his cabinet on Saturday. Japan, which counts Russia as its fifth-biggest supplier of crude oil, is also in discussion with the United States and European countries about possibly banning Russian oil imports, Kyodo News reported on Monday. Asked about a potential embargo on Russian oil imports at a regular news conference on Monday, Japan's top government spokesperson Hirokazu Matsuno declined to comment on its communication with the United States. Oil prices have soared over the past week after the United States and its allies sanctioned Russia over the invasion. A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil. The bill is getting fast-tracked and could ultimately become the vehicle for the sanctions. After Russia invaded Ukraine, the White House slapped sanctions on exports of technologies to Russia's refineries and the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which has never launched. So far, it has stopped short of targeting Russia's oil and gas exports as the Biden administration weighs the impacts on global oil markets and U.S. energy prices. Asked if the United States has ruled out banning Russian oil imports unilaterally, Blinken said: ""I'm not going to rule out taking action one way or another, irrespective of what they do, but everything we've done, the approach starts with coordinating with allies and partners,"" Blinken said. He said there were a series of additional measures that the United States was looking at to increase the pressure on Russia, but he did not provide any details on what the new measures would be. Americans are by far the world's heaviest consumers of gasoline, thanks to big cars, long driving distances and little public transportation in many areas. Rising gas prices have traditionally been political poison for U.S. leaders. The U.S. national average for a gallon of gasoline hit $4.009 on Sunday, the highest level since July 2008, according to AAA. Consumers are on average paying 40 cents more than a week ago, and 57 cents more than a month ago. The United States imported more than 20.4 million barrels of crude and refined products a month on average in 2021 from Russia, about 8% of U.S. liquid fuel imports, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).
