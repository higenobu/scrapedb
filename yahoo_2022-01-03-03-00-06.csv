Russo was charged with the unauthorized practice of a profession. A New York woman was arrested for giving a 17-year-old a COVID-19 vaccine shot without permission from his parents on Friday, according to to several reports. Police said Laura Parker Russo,54, is accused of injecting the teen with the shot at her residence in Sea Cliff, Long Island, WABC reported. The teen notified his mother, who called the police. According to Newsday, Russo was charged with unauthorized practice of a profession in connection to this incident. The outlet noted that during their investigation, police determined that Russo is not a medical professional. As WABC reported, Russo is expected to appear in court on January 21. The Nassau County Police did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. Last month, a mother in Los Angeles claimed that her 13-year-old, who has asthma and allergies, received the vaccine shot in exchange for pizza without her authorization, NBC Los Angeles reported. ""The lady that gave him the shot and signed the paper told my son, 'Please don't say anything. I don't want to get in trouble,'"" Maribel Duarte alleged, according to the outlet. A similar incident also occurred in Florida where a mother said her 5-year-old was given the flu shot at her elementary school without her written consent, CBS 12 reported.

1/3/2022,"Many Christians have rejected the scientific theory of evolution in part because they think it rules out the existence of a historical Adam and Eve. Yet some scientists and theologians argue that recent breakthroughs in genetics make a historical Adam and Eve compatible with evolution, and that this development may help bridge what many see as a conflict between faith and science. ""For over 160 years, the societal conflict over evolution has been deep and stubborn. But now, in a surprise twist, evolutionary science is making space for Adam and Eve,"" S. Joshua Swamidass, an associate professor at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, told Fox News Digital. ""It turns out that the theological questions are about genealogical ancestry, not genetics. In this paradigm shift, we are finding a better way forward, a better story to tell."" In his book ""The Genealogical Adam and Eve: The Surprising Science of Universal Ancestry,"" Swamidass argues that genetics and evolutionary theory do not conflict with the existence of Adam and Eve, universal ancestors of all humans whom Jesus died to save. GENETIC ‘ADAM’ AND ‘EVE’ UNCOVERED Modern genetics only captures a small sliver of the story of human ancestry, Swamidass writes. While your parents are both 100 percent your parents, you only get roughly 50 percent of your DNA from each of them, and only about 25 percent of your DNA from your grandparents. As you go farther back, you have more genealogical ancestors who each contribute less and less to your DNA. While universal genetic ancestors are rare, universal genealogical ancestors are surprisingly common, the author noted. Each individual has four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and so on, but population size in past generations tends to get smaller, so overlap is inevitable. He argues that by 1 A.D., every person on Earth was descended from Adam and Eve. Swamidass' model of a Genealogical Adam and Eve (GAE) claims that biological humans may still share a common ancestor with apes according to the theory of evolution, but God could have created Adam and Eve from the dust and a rib, without parents, and these two became the ancestors of all humans by 1 A.D. Swamidass claims that Genesis appears to require biological humans outside of Adam and Eve's family line because after Cain murders Abel and leaves his parents, he fears that he will be killed, he acquires a wife, and he builds a city. ""Most readers of Genesis understood Adam and Eve to be (1) ancestors of us all, and (2) miraculously created without parents of their own,"" Swamidass told Fox News Digital. ""In contrast, evolution teaches that (3) we share common ancestors with apes, and (4) we arise from a large population, not a single couple. This conflict of fact only seemed solvable by revising foundational Christian theological beliefs, or by rejecting evolution."" ""But now, clearing up some big scientific understandings, we know that all four of these things can be true at the same time,"" Swamidass said. ""Even if Adam and Eve lived as recently as just 6,000 years ago, they would be the genealogical ancestors of everyone across the globe by AD 1. They could even have been created de novo, from the dust and a rib. Of course, at the same time, we would also descend from people outside the Garden, others whom God created by a providentially governed process of evolution."" GERMANY BIBLE MUSEUM PUTS ON PLAY PRESENTING JESUS AS TRANSGENDER, WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS Swamidass' GAE model has already made waves in theological and scientific circles. The BioLogos Foundation, a Christian nonprofit founded by NIH Director Francis Collins that embraces the scientific theory of evolution, appears to have reversed its position on Adam and Eve, deleting articles claiming that genetics ruled out a historical Adam and Eve and posting articles that echo Swamidass' model. BioLogos did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the matter. William Lane Craig, a Christian philosophy professor at Houston Baptist University and Biola University's Talbot School of Theology, published the book ""In Quest of the Historical Adam: A Biblical and Scientific Exploration"" in September. His book echoes Swamidass' arguments – although he places Adam and Eve further back in history. Reasons to Believe (RTB), a Christian nonprofit dedicated to blending faith and science in a way that questions evolution but embraces an old earth, published a book in 2020 in which the author, Anjeanette Roberts, wrote that Swamidass' model ""provides a way for biblical interpretations of a historical Adam and Eve—understood as universal, genealogical ancestors for all humanity living at the time of Christ and today—to be reconciled with mainstream evolutionary science."" Michael Murray, a Christian philosophy professor at Franklin and Marshall College, recently said at an evangelical conference that due to the work of Swamidass, Craig, and others, ""we have arrived at the point where we can confidently affirm that the basic evolutionary story is not the threat to Christian orthodoxy that we once feared, and not because we had to compromise on orthodoxy."" ""My view is that recent findings in genetics and paleontology have shown that our best scientific theories and data do not rule out a historical Adam and Eve,"" Murray told Fox News Digital. He said the developments do not make Adam and Eve more or less likely, but they do show that, ""for all we know, there might have been a pair that is the ancestor of all extant humans or extant Homo sapiens."" CHRISTIAN MINISTRY APPEALS SPLC CASE TO SUPREME COURT, CHALLENGING NYT V. SULLIVAN Murray noted that ""there was an emerging consensus among both secular scientists and scientists of faith that the relevant empirical data was flatly inconsistent with an ancestral pair."" Yet these recent developments have shown ""that an ancestral pair is not flatly ruled out as was previously thought."" Nathan Lents, a secular professor of philosophy at John Jay College, told Fox News Digital that recent developments have made Adam and Eve more plausible. ""I would not say that there is any evidence, historical or scientific, in favor of the existence of Adam and Eve, as they are presented in the Bible,"" Lents said. ""However, there have been developments in our understanding of ancestry and genetics that allow for the possibility of universal ancestors of the entire human population in the surprisingly recent past."" He noted that ""there are important caveats"" about the possibility of universal ancestors, such as isolated populations, and about the impact of the GAE model – it does not involve ""sole progenitorship of the human race from just two people."" Many Christians disagree with the model, however. According to Gallup, 40 percent of Americans say God created man in his present form, and between 38 percent and 66 percent of White evangelical Protestants say the same, according to the Pew Research Center. Fazale Rana, vice president of research and apologetics at RTB, told Fox News Digital that the models of Swamidass and Craig ""both suffer from theological problems, despite their agreement with mainstream science."" Rana said that since the models do not consider Adam and Eve the sole progenitors of humanity, they ""potentially put key Christian doctrines (such as human exceptionalism, the Fall, Original Sin and the Atonement) in harm’s way."" Dr. Nathaniel Jeanson, a Christian biologist with the young-earth creationist organization Answers in Genesis, told Fox News Digital that Swamidass' ""definition of Adam and eve is almost unrecognizable from a Young Earth perspective; it’s essentially the mainstream model with an undetectable supernaturally created pair inserted at some point."" CHRISTIAN LEADERS RIP WASHINGTON POST ARTICLE CLAIMING ABORTION FIGHT BASED ON MISREADING OF BIBLE PASSAGE Jeanson said that his forthcoming book ""Traced: Human DNA's Big Surprise"" uses the same developments in genetics to show that ""the DNA history of mankind makes sense from a young-earth perspective,"" making and examining testable predictions. Yet even Rana and Jeanson admitted that the GAE model may decrease the public perception of a conflict between science and religion. ""It may soften the antagonism on the part of the evolutionary community,"" Jeanson said. Rana described these developments as ""good for the Church"" because ""they offer models that preserve the biblical narrative of human origins for those people who are persuaded by evidence for human evolution."" Yet he suggested that the GAE models ""will have little or no impact"" in the scientific community because they do not offer anything ""that distinguishes them from materialistic evolutionary models."" The secular Lents noted that ""science and Christianity have been pitted against each other unnecessarily. Conflicts over evolution have bred mistrust on both sides that has bled into other issues,"" like skepticism about vaccines. ""When Christians and evolutionary science find harmony and common ground, or at least a peaceful truce, we can build trust and begin to work together on matters that threaten the healthy, safety, and flourishing of us all,"" Lents said. ""For this reason, I applaud the work that Christian scientists are doing to bring greater acceptance and understanding of science into their communities. We need not be at war with each other."" Ken Keathley, a theology professor at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, said that the efforts of Swamidass, Craig, and others ""have been very fruitfrul."" ""One doesn’t have to agree with every assertion or conclusion made by Swamidass, Craig, or Rana and Ross to appreciate the advances in thinking,"" Keithley told Fox News Digital. ""Taken together, the work being done by these scholars demonstrate that there is no inherent conflict between faith and science."" Murray noted that ""the scientific community and the conservative Christian theological community were increasingly polarized on the issue of an ancestral human pair,"" but thanks to the GAE models, ""this standoff has now been defused."" While ""some scientists might think that the scenarios that involve belief in an ancestral pair are implausible, … we have gotten past the point of scientists arguing that the traditional view is impossible."" Swamidass told Fox News Digital that ""in making space for Adam and Eve, secular scientists have an opportunity to offer an olive branch to religious communities. I'm encouraged to see that many religious leaders – such as Ken Keathley from the SBC, William Lane Craig, and [RTB President] Hugh Ross – have been eager to take the olive branch. For those seeking to advance science in a fractured society, this is very good news indeed.""",Science/Fox News,Christians point to genetics breakthroughs to show Adam and Eve are not incompatible with evolution,https://news.yahoo.com/christians-point-genetics-breakthroughs-show-130609041.html
1/3/2022,"Archaeologists revealed more wonders of the ancient world in 2021. They ranged from a lost city, a mummy with a golden tongue, and 2,400-year-old baskets of fruit. We document some of the best archaeological finds of the last 12 months. In 2021 archaeologists discovered an array of lost treasures of the ancient world. Insider's coverage of the archaeological breakthroughs included Egyptian mummies with tongues of gold, sunken Crusader trove, and 2000-year-old Roman slave quarters perfectly preserved by a volcanic eruption. 2,400-year-old baskets of fruit discovered in ancient Egyptian city under the sea In August 2021, Insider's Alia Shoaib reported that 2,400-year-old baskets of fruit were discovered in an ancient Egyptian under-sea city Thonis-Heracleion. Archaeologists found a trove of ancient artifacts from the fourth century BCE, including wicker baskets filled with doum, fruit from an African palm tree, grape seeds, and Greek ceramics. The fascinating discovery was made by a team of researchers from the European Institute for Underwater Archaeology, led by the French marine archaeologist Franck Goddio, who discovered the ruin of Thonis-Heracleion twenty years ago. Goddio told the Guardian that the fruit had been untouched for over 2000 years, calling the find ""incredible."" Archaeologists discovered 2 ancient graves of a mother and baby near Stonehenge in England In February, Archaeologists in England found two ancient graves near the prehistoric Stonehenge in Salisbury. The find was made during excavations necessary before the creation of a new highway tunnel. The two graves were declared to be roughly 4,500 years old — as old as the stones in the central circle of the henge — and belonging to a mother and baby. The pair were thought to be related to those who built the circle, with Matt Leivers, an archaeologist with Wessex Archaeology who helped survey the area having told Insider: ""The later arrangements of bluestones would have been built around the time these people lived and died — if they weren't the builders then they might have been their relatives, or perhaps their children or grandchildren."" Stonehenge has been a mystery for centuries — until February 2021, when researchers discovered the stones had been transported from Wales to Salisbury, suggesting the henge is a type of burial ground.  'Lost golden city' found in Egypt In April 2021, Jacob Sarkisian reported that a ""lost golden city"" was found in Egypt, 300 miles south of Cairo.  It was one of the largest ancient cities ever discovered in the country and one of the most significant finds since the discovery of Tutankhamun's tomb a century ago. The team said in a statement: ""The Egyptian mission under Dr. Zahi Hawass found the city that was lost under the sands. The city is 3,000 years old, dates to the reign of Amenhotep III, and continued to be used by Tutankhamun and Ay."" The city features several neighborhoods, intact 10-feet-high walls, and even a bakery. The earliest evidence of tobacco used by hunter-gatherers in the US West 12,000 years ago At the beginning of October 2021, Joshua Zitser reported that the earliest evidence of tobacco use was found in Utah. The find dates back over 12,000 years, with the leaf believed to be used by hunter-gatherers for food preparation. This uncovered the fact that humans may have been using tobacco some 9,000 years earlier than previously thought. You can read Insider's senior news reporter Joshua Zitser's full report here.  An amateur diver found a 3-foot sword off the Israeli coast dating back to the Crusades In October 2021, an amateur diver in Israel made an incredible find: a three-foot crusade-era sword. Shlomi Katzin came across a giant sword, covered in shells and marine life, 13 feet under the Mediterranean waves as he was exploring the waters of the Carmel coast. Katzin also found giant metal and stone anchors and bits of pottery nestled in a 1,000 square-foot patch of the sandy seabed during his exploration. Katzin reported his find to the Israel Antiquities Authority, and they declared the sword to be from between the 11th and 13th centuries. ""It is exciting to encounter such a personal object, taking you 900 years back in time to a different era, with knights, armor, and swords."" Nir Distelfeld, an inspector for the IAA's Robbery Prevention Unit, said in a press release. You can read Aylin Woodward's full report here.  Archaeologists discovered an Egyptian mummy buried with a golden tongue In February 2021, archaeologists in Egypt uncovered a mummy buried with a golden tongue in its mouth.  Egyptian and Dominican archaeologists found 16 burial shafts at the Taposiris Magna Temple near Alexandria. When searching the places of rest, they found one mummy who was given a golden amulet in the shape of a tongue placed in its mouth. The amulet is a great honor, thought to give the dead the ability to speak to gods. Rare evidence of Roman crucifixion found in England In December 2021, Insider's Rebecca Cohen and Erin Schumaker reported that a skeleton in England was found with a nail through its foot — rare evidence of Roman crucifixion.  Researchers in Cambridgeshire were analyzing findings from a dig of an ancient Roman settlement, and when they researched the bones found, they discovered this evidence of crucifixion. While crucifixion was thought to be relatively common for the Roman era, few pieces of evidence for it exist. The find is just the fourth known crucifixion in the world, with it ranking as the best-preserved one. Astonishing images of Roman slave quarters in Pompeii frozen in time for almost 2,000 years by a volcanic eruption In November 2021, archaeologists in Pompeii, Italy, found incredibly well-preserved 2000-year old slave quarters.  The room, frozen in time due to the Mount Vesuvius eruption of 79 AD, featured beds, a chest, and a chamber pot. Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director-general of Pompeii's archaeological park, hailed the findings on the Pompeii website as a ""window into the precarious reality of people who seldom appear in historical sources.""  High-tech scanners 'unwrapped' a mummified Egyptian pharaoh, revealing a seemingly healthy 35-year-old with no clues for how he died Just as 2021 closed, Insider's science reporter Dr. Marianne Guenot reported how 3D CT scanners had been used to 'unwrap' a mummified Egyptian pharaoh.  The images showed ""unprecedented detail"" of the body of Amenhotep I, said Sahar Saleem, a professor of radiology and lead author of a study on the mummy. Amenhotep was the second Pharaoh of Egypt's 18th dynasty, ruling for over two decades in 1525 BC. The scans were able to age the Pharaoh and tell that he was 5 feet, 6 inches, tall, circumcised, had a narrow chin, a small narrow nose, curly hair, mildly protruding upper teeth, and a pierced left ear. The discovery of a 2000-year-old dagger was a vital clue to revealing a forgotten battle between the Roman Empire's legions and tribal warriors In Switzerland, a volunteer archaeologist uncovered a Roman-era dagger that has revealed intricate details of an ancient battle. Schmid unearthed the dagger in the mountainous Graubünden region of Switzerland, an area believed to be the site of a lost battlefield where Imperial Roman soldiers fought Rhaetian warriors in approximately 15 BC. This discovery then sparked further explorations, revealing a battlefield. The dagger, dated to around 15 BC, is a rare find. The team behind the discovery explained that only four of its kind had ever been found in former Roman territories. You can read the full report from myself and my colleague Joshua Zitser.

1/3/2022,"Two 19-year-old men who went missing on a camping trip near Swastika Mountain in Oregon helped rescuers find them by writing “SOS” in the snow, officials said. “These young men did a lot of things right to give themselves the best chance of being rescued,” Lt. Maggie Champin of the U.S. Coast Guard said in a news release. “By writing ‘SOS’ in the snow, staying near their vehicle and staying near logging roads, we were able to find them relatively quickly,” Champin said. The two men had gone camping near the mountain about 32 miles southeast of Eugene around Christmas Day and were reported overdue Wednesday, Dec. 29, the release said. Rescuers from the Lane County Sheriff’s Department searched for the two men but were hampered by heavy snow. A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter found the teens Saturday, Jan. 1, and hoisted them aboard, the release said. Neither had medical concerns. The helicopter also spotted two other people in distress and notified sheriff’s search crews, the Coast Guard reported. Swastika Mountain got its name from a town named after a nearby cattle rancher’s swastika-shaped brand years before the Nazis claimed the symbol, the Mail Tribune reported.
