12/26/2021,"Jonny Bairstow stressed “everyone is trying” after England delivered their latest soft batting collapse in an Ashes campaign that is fast unravelling.  Boxing Day at the MCG followed a familiar pattern when Joe Root’s tourists, wearing black armbands in memory of Ray Illingworth, were bowled out for 185 all out thanks in part to a sublime three-wicket morning from Australia’s returning Pat Cummins. Root top-scored with 50 and Bairstow marked his latest recall to the Test side with battling 35 from 75 balls that tried to overcome a lack of match practice on tour, but both sat among a catalogue of dismissals that made belated for Christmas gifts. Trailing the series 2-0 and yet to pass 300 with the bat on tour, England require a dramatic turnaround of fortunes during the remainder of the third Test if they are to prevent Australia claiming a series win at the earliest opportunity. Speaking after stumps on day one, with Australia 61 for one in reply, Bairstow said: “We’re still searching for that big score but both teams were looking to bowl first on that pitch this morning with the help of the conditions and a tinge of green. “I don’t think that you can complain when it’s obviously individuals going out and playing in the way in which they foresee is best. That’s exactly what it’s about. “Naturally the execution … wasn’t there today. But the amount of times that we’ve seen those shots being executed and going to the boundary is high. “It’s one of those days that … we will look back on and probably reassess next time and potentially take different options.” Arguably the most galling dismissal came when, on the stroke of tea with England already 128 for five, the newly-arrived Jos Buttler needlessly tried to take on Nathan Lyon only to hole out for three. From a senior player, it was quite staggering. “That’s an individual decision,” said Bairstow, when asked about his team-mate’s choice. “If that’s the game plan to take the off-spinner down and put the pressure back on, to push the field back, then that’s the game plan that was taken. “I can tell you now, everyone is trying; different methods, individual training techniques. [But] when you’ve got guys bowling 138-144kph it makes you make decisions quicker. That’s part and parcel of the game. “We’ve got to get a bit stronger and tougher with our dismissals. We know that and we’ve spoken about that. That is just being honest with ourselves.” As well as tightening their grip on the urn, Australia’s latest show of dominance had additional significance when Scott Boland was handed his Baggy Green cap and became just the second Indigenous man after Jason Gillespie to play for their Test side. The 32-year-old Victorian also got off the mark in the wickets column to the delight of his home crowd, Mark Wood trapped lbw for six and failing with a review despite uncertainty over whether the ball had struck pad or bat first. “I’m pretty proud,” said Boland, who also claimed two catches. “Obviously my family’s very proud as well. It means a lot to join a pretty small club and hopefully it’s just the start of something big for the Indigenous community in cricket. “I just hope I can be a role model for young Indigenous kids to want to play cricket. I think the Indigenous community in [Australian Rules Football] and rugby are so big and hopefully one day Aboriginals in cricket can be just as big.” ",Sport/Sport,Jonny Bairstow bemoans losing the toss and poor shots amid England collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/26/jonny-bairstow-bemoans-losing-the-toss-and-poor-shots-amid-england-collapse
12/26/2021,"A large Roman fort believed to have played a key role in the successful invasion of Britain in AD43 has been discovered on the Dutch coast. A Roman legion of “several thousand” battle-ready soldiers was stationed in Velsen, 20 miles from Amsterdam, on the banks of the Oer-IJ, a tributary of the Rhine, research suggests.  Dr Arjen Bosman, the archaeologist behind the findings, said the evidence pointed to Velsen, or Flevum in Latin, having been the empire’s most northernly castra (fortress) built to keep a Germanic tribe, known as the Chauci, at bay as the invading Roman forces prepared to cross from Boulogne in France to England’s southern beaches. The fortified camp appears to have been established by Emperor Caligula (AD12 to AD41) in preparation for his failed attempt to take Britannia in about AD40, but was then successfully developed and exploited by his successor, Claudius, for his own invasion in AD43. Bosman said: “We know for sure Caligula was in the Netherlands as there are markings on wooden wine barrels with the initials of the emperor burnt in, suggesting that these came from the imperial court. “What Caligula came to do were the preparations for invading England – to have the same kind of military achievement as Julius Caesar – but to invade and remain there. He couldn’t finish the job as he was killed in AD41 and Claudius took over where he left off in AD43. “We have found wooden planks underneath the watchtower, or the gate of the fort, and this is the phase just before the invasion of England. The wooden plank has been dated in the winter of AD42/43. That is a lovely date. I jumped in the air when I heard it.” Claudius’s invading forces, untouched by the Germanic tribes, made their landing in Kent and by the summer of AD43 the emperor was confident enough to travel to Britain, entering Camulodunum (Colchester) in triumph to receive the submission of 12 chieftains. Within three years, the Romans had claimed the whole of Britain as part of their empire. Bosman said: “The main force came from Boulogne and Calais, but the northern flank of that attack had to be covered and it was covered by the fort in Velsen. The Germanic threat comes up in Roman literature several times. “It was an early warning system to the troops in France. It didn’t matter what the Germanic tribes put in the field as there was a legion there.” The first evidence of a Roman fort in Velsen, North Holland, had been uncovered in 1945 by schoolchildren who found shards of pottery in an abandoned German anti-tank trench. Research was undertaken in the 1950s during the building of the Velsertunnel, under the Nordzeekanaal, and archaeological excavations took place in the 1960s and 70s. In 1997, Bosman’s discovery of Roman ditches in three places, and a wall and a gate were thought sufficient evidence for the area to become a state protected archaeological site. But at this stage the Velsen camp, identified as having been used between AD39 and AD47, was thought to have been small. This theory was complemented by the discovery in 1972 of an earlier fort, known as Velsen 1, which is believed to have been in operation from AD15 to AD30. A thoroughgoing excavation of that site found it had been abandoned following the revolt of the Frisians, the Germanic ethnic group indigenous to the coastal regions of the Netherlands. Archaeologists discovered human remains in some former wells, a tactic used by retreating Romans to poison the waters. The existence of the two forts within a few hundred metres of each other had led researchers to believe for decades that they were both likely to have been mere castellum, minor military camps of just one or two hectares. It was only in November, through piecing together features of the later Veslen fort that were noted in the 1960s and 70s, but not recognised at the time as Roman, and taking into account his own archaeological findings over the last quarter of a century, that a new understanding was reached. “It is not one or two hectares like the first fort in Velsen, but at least 11 hectares,” Bosman said. “We always thought it was the same size but that is not true. It was a legionary fortress and that’s something completely different.” Bosman added: “Up to this year I wondered about the number of finds at Velsen 2, a lot of military material, a lot of weapons, long daggers, javelins, far more than we found on Velsen 1. “And we know there was a battle at Velsen 1, and on a battlefield you find weapons. The number of weapons at Velsen 2 can only be explained in a legionary context. Several thousand men were occupying this fort. “At 11 hectares, this would not be a complete fort for a full legion of 5,000 to 6,000 men but we don’t where it ends in the north and so it could have been larger.” The Velsen 2 fort was abandoned in AD47 after Claudius ordered all his troops to retreat behind the Rhine. Roman rule of Britain ended around AD410 as the empire began to collapse in response to internal fighting and the ever-growing threats from Germanic tribes.",News/World news,Large Roman fort built by Caligula discovered near Amsterdam,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/roman-fort-built-by-caligula-discovered-velsen-near-amsterdam
12/26/2021,"The names running glade clover, cream tick-trefoil and Porter’s goldenrod may evoke the riotous colours of a summer meadow in bloom, but these particular plants are also quietly tucked away in a conservation seed bank that it is hoped will ensure the future of North America’s grassland plant populations.  Changes in land and sea use is the key driver of biodiversity loss in the world – and grassland loss is “the single greatest conservation issue currently facing eastern North American biodiversity”, according to the Southeastern Grasslands Initiative (SGI) at the Center of Excellence for Field Biology, Austin Peay State University, which is working to conserve and restore this crucial ecosystem. Last year it launched a conservation seed bank (CSB) to preserve vulnerable populations of rare and declining grassland species. Cooper Breeden, the SGI’s plant conservation manager, says: “One of the reasons we decided to pursue the CSB was because the loss of our rare plant populations is outpacing efforts to conserve them in many cases, though not for lack of effort. There is simply not enough funding and capacity for conservation. “We sought to fill the gap by endeavouring to collect the rare and declining grassland species of the south-east, especially targeting those populations that are particularly vulnerable and currently not receiving much conservation attention.” Since August 2020, the team has squirrelled away more than 35,000 seeds in 66 collections of 29 species. But SGI’s work does not stop at banking seeds. “Ideally, we try to conserve populations where they occur,” says Breeden. “The ultimate goal of these collections is to support the survival of populations in the wild.” The next stage is an interactive map that will allow users to see which species are in the seed bank and where they came from. “The goal in making some of our collection data easily accessible to the public is that it could serve as a resource for our partners involved in grasslands conservation in the region,” he says. “As the capacity of our conservation community grows, there will be increasing opportunities to put these seeds back in the ground.” Sixty billion tonnes of renewable and non-renewable resources are extracted globally each year, which makes the direct exploitation of resources, alongside the exploitation of organisms, the second biggest driver of biodiversity loss. When it comes to water, consumption has been increasing worldwide by about 1% a year since the 1980s, and global water demand is expected to continue increasing at a similar rate until 2050, according to the UN World Water Development Report 2019. Desalination plants have been the focus of attention, but as cities and towns from California to Sydney battle drought and water shortages they are turning to the likes of Israel and Singapore for guidance on how to recycle wastewater. Globally, 80% of wastewater currently flows back into the ecosystem without being treated or reused. Over decades, Israel has invested heavily in the treatment of wastewater, alongside desalination plants, recycling nearly 90% through sewage treatment facilities, which redirect the treated water to irrigation. The sludge byproduct is used as fertiliser and to generate biogas. In Singapore, five NEWater plants meet up to 40% of the country’s water needs by recycling, according to the national water agency. By 2060, NEWater is expected to meet up to 55% of demand. Its 48km-long deep tunnel sewerage system (DTSS), a used water superhighway, carries used water to reclamation plants to be treated and purified into reclaimed water, or discharged into the sea. When a second phase of the project, currently under way, is completed, pumping stations and conventional water reclamation plants will be phased out, freeing up land. They neither sound glamorous nor hog the limelight, but bogs and peatlands hold one of the keys to combatting the climate crisis. While peatlands cover only 3% of the global land surface, they store nearly 550bn tonnes of carbon – twice as much as in all the world’s forests. About 10% of the UK is covered in peatland. However, much of this is degraded, and estimates suggest that UK peatlands could be emitting the equivalent of 23m tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. Restoring degraded peatlands could stop these emissions and create biodiversity benefits for wildlife, including plants, birds and insects. The Great North Bog – which includes four national parks, three areas of outstanding natural beauty, and the proposed South Pennines Park – represents about 92% of the upland peat in England and is one of the main UK restoration projects. The project, led by the North Pennines AONB Partnership, the Yorkshire Peat Partnership and the Moors for the Future Partnership, is aiming to restore nearly 7,000 sq km of upland peat, which store 400m tonnes of carbon. Damaged peat in the Great North Bog currently releases an estimated 4.4m tonnes of carbon annually but project organisers hope that “by joining up some of the most successful peatland restoration organisations in Europe we can bring about a massive and urgent step change in saving the majority of England’s upland peatlands before it is too late”. Scientists have predicted that in the next 20 years the amount of plastic waste in the oceans is likely to nearly triple in volume, from an estimated 8m tonnes a year today to 29m tonnes by 2040. There is no single solution to the plastic crisis, but scientists, inventors and volunteers across the globe are looking at myriad ways to overcome it. A team at the Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions at Duke University in the US is trying to gather all this information in a “plastic pollution prevention and collection technology inventory”. Among the 52 technologies included so far are the Great Bubble Barrier, where “tubes placed diagonally across the bottom of the waterway create a bubble barrier by pumping air, creating a current that brings debris to the surface and guides it to a catchment system”; the Holy Turtle, a 1,000ft floating unit which is towed by two marine vessels and captures floating waste; and Stow it, don’t throw it, a youth-driven initiative that recycles tennis ball containers into fishing line recycling bins for anglers. Zoie Diana, a PhD candidate in the marine science and conservation department at Duke University and one of the team behind the inventory, says they are aiming to add more than 40 new technologies by early next year. “We hope that our study and inventory serve as a tool to prevent plastic from entering waterways and collect existing pollution, complementing ongoing efforts to reduce the generation of plastic pollution further upstream in its life cycle.” At least 107 highly threatened birds, mammals and reptiles are estimated to have benefited from invasive mammal eradication on islands, according to a study published in 2016. “Although still few and spatially localised, such cases show that with prompt and appropriate action, it is possible to reduce human-induced extinction rates,” the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)’s global assessment noted. New Zealand is at the forefront of this action and has committed to eradicating stoats, possums and rats by the middle of the century under its Predator Free 2050 plan, using a mixture of trapping, hunting, poison and technology. But it is also trialling other projects. A purpose-built predator exclusion fence has been erected to protect 6,000 sq metres of prime habitat for the endangered robust grasshopper, thought to be the world’s first fenced habitat designed for an insect. The aim of New Zealand’s Predator Free 2050 is to “return the voices of the insects, bats, reptiles and birds back to the forests, farmland, towns, cities and coasts”. Currently, 74% of the country’s native terrestrial birds, 84% of its native reptile species and 46% of vascular plant species are threatened with extinction, or at risk of becoming threatened, according to the Department of Conservation. But in the five years since Predator Free 2050 was launched, the numbers of birds such as kea, kākā, kākāriki, the Antipodes snipe and the Tūī have all increased, according to a five-year progress report.

12/26/2021,"When you read about all the stories around small businesses in 2021 a few general themes quickly appear. Inflation. Supply chain. Labor shortages. Covid. All true. All relevant. All important. But all these stories are relatively short term. Inflation will, someday, be under control again. Shipping will catch up. Labor will come and go. Covid will always be around but we’ll just live with it. The reality is that there was just one story about small businesses in 2021 that’s really going to have a long-term impact. It has received much less attention and yet it will be transformational. The small business story this year is about blockchain. Because in 2021, blockchain emerged as the next big thing for entrepreneurs. It’s real and it’s happening. And smart entrepreneurs know this.  Richerd, for example, knows this. According to his story in CNET, Richerd is an “affable” Canadian software developer who started building cryptocurrency software in 2013 and ultimately moved into buying and selling NFT (non-fungible token) art online. Richerd bought CryptoPunk #6046 – a digital art piece – in March for about $86,000 and the next day – he says – was offered more than $9.5m to take it off his hands. Given what I know about the digital art marketplace, this story is not unbelievable. And if you can believe it, he actually rejected the offer, calling his art “priceless” and saying it wasn’t for sale no matter what the price. OK, so maybe Richerd isn’t the smartest blockchain entrepreneur around. Or maybe he is and will ultimately sell CryptoPunk #6046 for a billion. Regardless, he can certainly spot value. And he’s not alone. Quietly, a growing wave of new entrepreneurs – and big brands – are jumping into the blockchain world in what is fast becoming the next great American Gold Rush. Except that all the gold is virtual …and unlike the 1870s it actually exists and there’s plenty to go around. For those not keeping up on the tech, here’s a quick recap. Blockchain is like an unbreakable, infinite, digital accounting ledger. It’s part of a secure, dispersed database that’s shared by many computers on a distributed network (many call this Web3, the next iteration of the internet) and stores its information in such a way that guarantees the security and individuality of each record of data. Because of blockchain, cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and Ether (and many others) can exist. NFTs are unique, inimitable and non-interchangeable units of data stored on a blockchain and can be associated with photos, videos, audio and other forms of art which then makes those assets uniquely and permanently identified. So just as there’s only one original Mona Lisa, by attaching an NFT to a digital drawing you can also make it one-of-a-kind. This means that if you create your own piece of digital art or any other similar product on the blockchain, like the products sold by online companies such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club or through markets such as OpenSea, you can create your own business. Many smart entrepreneurs are realizing this. And cashing in. And attracting cash. Which is why the cryptocurrency market is now worth more than $3tn and in 2021 venture capital firms have poured about $30bn into this universe, according to a recent Bloomberg report, which is more than all the previous years combined and quadruple the previous high mark hit in 2018. It’s why payment companies like PayPal, Block (formerly Square) and Coinbase are allowing their users to easily transfer digital currency like dollars and euros. It’s why the Staples Center in Los Angeles is now called Crypto.com Arena. It’s why big brands like Nike are buying digital art companies like RTFKT. All this buying and selling is driving the need for new technologies and platforms in the digital world, and marketplaces like OpenSea, Nifty Gateway, SingularityNET, Syscoin, Dapp and bitFlyer are small businesses profiting by creating new entrepreneurs and artists eager to serve these hungry customers. And looming in the background is the soon-to-be overwhelming Metaverse, a virtual world of future interactions and digital transactions so great that the world’s largest social media platform changed its corporate brand to prepare for it. Sure, the media will remember 2021 as the year of inflation, supply chain, labor unrest and Covid. But those types of challenges have been around forever and will always come and go. The real story this year is the explosion of a digital world of transactions that will, over the next few years, spawn a new economy of entrepreneurs and create trillions in wealth.

12/26/2021,"January can feel like the longest month: a full 31-dayer to begin with, of course, but also inordinately stretched by its sense of constant renewal. New resolutions to be kept, new standards to be met, new taxes to be filed – and that’s before we factor in Omicron, which looks set to make it an especially testing start to the year. All in all, it’s a good time to investigate new ways to entertain ourselves and nourish our minds.Cue the 31-day short film diet, a sequel to last January’s much-loved literary diet. This one-a-day starter pack – to form a different, more pleasurable kind of new year habit – is aimed at enriching our lives, not depriving it of small joys. Most of us don’t think of ourselves as regular watchers of short films per se, though we can be without realising it: what is a YouTube cat video, after all, if not a short film of some description?We’ve kept to a broad remit in defining short films for this collection. Some are cinematic by design, others made by and for mobile phones. There are works by big-name film-makers such as David Lynch and Lynne Ramsay, while viral stars such as Mufasa feature alongside musical headliners including Beyoncé and Thom Yorke.High contrast is the goal: if you feel disoriented transitioning from an animated Nazi-hunter thriller one day to an ebullient viral dance video the next, all the better to keep you on your toes.What the shorts do have in common, we hope, is a certain spirit-lifting sensibility. They’re not all necessarily feelgood or inspirational in the conventional sense (though some, like the Netflix triumph-over-adversity doc Zion, certainly meet that brief), but they all offer a stimulating dose of beauty, invention, expansive thinking or occasional concentrated joy. We’ve tried to stick to free content – though some require a Netflix subscription or trial, or a free sign-up to Vimeo – and to steer away from outright downers, but themes of loss, prejudice and the climate are woven through in unexpected ways. Happy watching, and happy new year.  So, it’s New Year’s Day, you might be feeling a tad delicate, and what you need is a soothing bit of beautiful whimsy to ease into 2022. Argentine director Juan Solanas’s unexpectedly tender, retro-futuristic mini-romance is just the ticket, despite its seemingly morbid premise of a headless man seeking love and self-completion. Turns out the head isn’t everything. At a loose end professionally, an aspiring documentary film-maker resolves to make an easy buck by shooting stock footage – while drolly talking us through his fraying state of mind. A witty dedication to any creatives and freelancers who aren’t where they want to be in life, and resonant to everyone experiencing the “what am I doing?” January blues. Paul Thomas Anderson, whose new film, Licorice Pizza, hits cinemas in January, has long dabbled in music-video directing, making striking clips for the likes of Fiona Apple and Haim. But this Netflix-produced collaboration with Thom Yorke is his most polished and haunting effort in the medium, an overnight Prague dream odyssey from Orwellian dystopia to gentle human contact. TS Eliot died on this day in 1965, and while this beguiling Australian animation isn’t a direct tribute to him, one suspects the poet of Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats would have been charmed by this verse-based, Nick Cave-narrated imagining of the decadent, jazz-hip nightlife of our feline friends. If these guys had made Cats, it might have all worked out. This Bafta-nominated short finds an initially absurd but strangely moving metaphor for the gradual wrench of terminal disease, as Olivia Colman’s middle-class housewife is struck with a rare condition that causes her to lift off the ground at an ever-increasing, irreversible rate. But that’s not the only uplift infusing proceedings: there’s beauty amid the devastation. Animation doesn’t seem like the obvious medium for a documentary short about the 1960 capture of on-the-run Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann, but with its sharp, austere ink-sketch aesthetic, this gripping mini-thriller proves otherwise. The visuals convey a suitable sense of subterfuge, but also the fragility of history, vulnerable to fading and being redrawn. Like it or not, social media dance videos have become their own generational art form, amplified by TikTok during the pandemic – though many of them are now so polished and rehearsed that they lose their sense of fun. Scruffily shot, this early viral example explodes with manic, elated energy, inviting chronic repeat viewing. Your weekend starts here. Beyoncé upended the form of the music video with her recent series of visual albums, merging art, activism and the simple pleasures of a good bop. Exquisitely conceived by the singer herself and British artist Nkiru, this celebratory 2020 ode to the power and pride in black and brown skin is the most joyful thing she’s made in ages. If your environmentally minded New Year resolutions are already slipping a week into 2022, let this adorable but sneakily gut-wrenching animation renew your resolve. Its story of two polar bears left homeless by global heating, washing up on a verdant but hostile island, is unabashedly manipulative but effective – and a gentle way to explain the issues at hand to young ones. In collaboration with journalist Caspar Salmon, documentary-maker Shackleton unfolds an oft-shared family tale that seems too quirky to be true, as Salmon recalls his grandmother attending a 1980s gathering for fishy-surnamed folk on the Welsh island of Anglesey. What ensues is a mischievous, wickedly funny study of how personal memory and myth are formed and blurred. Born without legs and thrust into the foster system, where his upbringing was unstable and abusive, Zion Clark finally found his calling in high-school wrestling, rising through the ranks and pursuing Olympic dreams. With rich Netflix production values, this short documentary portrait of him wrings every ounce of inspirational joy from his story, and you can’t remain unmoved. The BFI player is a rich source of free British shorts and archival curios, and this winning, subtly acerbic 1992 short is one of its treasures – rather ahead of its time in its good-humoured discussion of cultural appropriation and diasporic living, via the walking-and-talking of two British-Indian cousins through a timeworn tangle of London streets. With veteran New Zealand film-maker Jane Campion currently riding a fresh wave of critical acclaim for the Oscar-tipped The Power of the Dog, it’s a good time to revisit this lyrical short from 2006 – starring her own daughter Alice Englert. A child’s-eye perspective on living through drought, it blends a pertinent message of environmental sustainability with a poetic wisp of magical realism. The Thai auteur specialises in measured, meditative experimental cinema that envelops you in a hazy daze. That’s true of his latest feature, the Tilda Swinton-starring Memoria, out in cinemas on 14 January – and of this short, entrancing art piece, in which a woman’s insomnia leaves her in a limbo state, licked but not burned by spreading flames. Bryce Dallas Howard shows her father Ron’s aptitude for plainly effective, unapologetically sentimental heartstring-pulling in this one-minute weepie from 2015. It sweetly plays out a life cycle of courtship, marriage and family purely through the shoes – a battered pair of Converse, and some chic two-tone derbies, both bearing their own personalities – worn by two lovers. There’s more to TikTok than dance videos and memes: budding film-makers are using it as a means of demonstrating their storytelling abilities on a shoestring. This breezy, sweetly silly take on the strains of lockdown dating – complete with screen freezes and collisions – won a one-minute short competition held by the Raindance film festival. Bigger things may lie ahead. As America marks Martin Luther King day, it feels an apt moment to savour this extraordinary reevaluation of African-American cinema and images from the Oscar-nominated director. Made before Bradley’s breakout feature Time, but only recently made viewable online, it traces a powerful, illuminating arc from rediscovered black silent cinema to present-day representation. Cartoonist Ware made this droll short for the radio show This American Life in 2009, and there’s more to it than meets the eye. Ostensibly a minor anecdote about a New York street encounter (or not), told in crucially different ways by a husband and wife, it swiftly grows into a perceptive, gendered reflection on unreliable storytelling and memory. Part of the TateShots short film series, this affectionate, illuminating primer on the life and work of the late American abstract painter Agnes Martin is guided by the perspectives of curator Frances Morris and art dealer Arne Glimcher. “Her painting is the key to the art within you,” says Glimcher: this short reminds us that looking can be a creative act in itself. It’s American weirdmeister Lynch’s birthday. If you don’t have time to celebrate by watching your favourite feature of his, this perfectly bizarre short, which has been quietly sitting on Netflix for several years now, will do nicely. Behind a gauze of cigarette smoke, Lynch himself takes the lead in this one, as a detective interrogating a capuchin monkey accused of murder. Of course. The concept for this lauded Swedish short is disarmingly simple and relateably human: fix a camera on a 10-metre diving platform at an indoor pool, and watch the reactions of various would-be divers as they contemplate the jump. Some baulk, some wait, some go for it in glorious slow-motion, and the film pulses with their anxiety and adrenaline. Back to TikTok, the ultra-short form of which can also be serialised in compelling ways – as with this viral four-part series of videos in which a young woman uncovers a decidedly unsettling portal in her apartment. Shot and narrated with a tongue-in-cheek hint of Blair Witch Project creepiness, it’s surely bound to inspire a longer horror film one of these days. Part 1 /Part 2/ Part 3/ Part 4 Between Dune, The Card Counter and TV’s Scenes from a Marriage, the internet reached peak Oscar Isaac thirst in 2021, and if you’re still not satisfied, this mordant revenge comedy from 2014 is a tart chaser. Staged in a heightened manner in a single room, its story of a wealthy man uncovering various intimate betrayals is minor: Isaac’s louche star quality is the draw here. I was unfamiliar with the work of Israeli-born singer-songwriter Asaf Avidan until last year, but a music video directed by the veteran German film-maker is one way to get my attention. Exactingly staged and composed, the video recalls Wenders’s documentary Pina as a modern dance piece interacting with urban architecture, mesmerisingly performed by American dancer Bobbi Jene Smith. It’s Burns Night tonight, and while we could have chosen something explicitly Burns-themed, we’ve opted for a looser interpretation of Scots poetry in motion, courtesy of their greatest working film-maker. Commissioned in 2012 by the London Olympics and ravishingly shot in black and white, it’s a hypnotic, Bafta-awarded odyssey, tracing a lone wild swimmer through Britain’s waterways. This Dutch animation collective nabbed an Oscar nomination for this ingeniously conceived, darkly hilarious stop-motion short, which squeezes a woman’s entire life and a time-travel conceit worthy of Christopher Nolan into three fat-free minutes. Its chronology is dictated by the skips and blips of a single record on a faulty turntable – just don’t let it reach the end. A talented young tennis player is weighed down by pressure from his demanding father: the premise of Gallagher’s pristinely shot short promises a standard-issue sports drama. Yet the film’s dreamy tone and impressionistic structure defy expectations, and the film emerges as a moving essay on toxic masculinity and how to defeat it. The video essay has become a lively, expansive alternative form of film criticism, and Portuguese critic and film-maker Azevedo is one of its foremost practitioners. This valentine to the recurring role of the kitsch kitchen in Pedro Almodóvar’s cinema is a delight, and apt viewing with the Spanish auteur’s latest (and kitchen-tastic) melodrama, Parallel Mothers, in cinemas on 28 January. Yates’s recent debut feature, Pirates, was a lively, irreverent surprise, though his short film work shows where his snappy brand of comedy came from. In this one, three contrasting Londoners vent about their various reservations about dating and relationships, from commitment phobia to wasted bikini waxes. It boasts a sharp, funny turn from Daniel Kaluuya to boot. We couldn’t complete this diet without one example of the most prevalent form of short film-making in our lives – the humble TV ad.

12/26/2021,"If Christmas is often synonymous with hours spent indoors, the lure of the sofa and endless screentime, our second festive season spent under the shadow of Covid is presumably taking those things to their extremes. The world has shrunk: our lives are full of cautious friends and relatives, cancelled trips and the imperative to stay where we are. The cold and dark complete the picture. Once again, this threatens to be a season of seclusion. To temporarily escape, millions of us will be going for walks – that inbuilt part of many people’s Christmases, which also chimes with how many of us have coped with the past two years. According to Sport England, between January and March this year, against the backdrop of another full national lockdown, 24.7 million people said they had recently engaged in “walking for leisure”, an increase of 5.2 million people compared with 12 months before. In September, the Department for Transport published research showing that in 2020 people in England walked an average of 220 miles (the highest figure since records began nearly 20 years ago) and that the number of walks of a mile or more had jumped by 26% in a single year. The Ramblers, the UK charity and membership organisation that does a huge amount of work around walking and access to open spaces, says that in the second half of 2020 it recruited 30% more new members than it had done a year earlier. These are all fascinating numbers: proof, perhaps, that when our leisure options are suddenly shut down, a lot of us instinctively seek solace in one of the most primal pastimes there is.  At which point, an admission. I walk, I am well aware of being fortunate enough to be able to do so, and I cannot imagine life without it. The habit has roots in my childhood; when I lived in London in my 20s and 30s, I eventually became a fairly committed urban walker. But it was not until I moved out of the city and became a parent that walking grew into a gloriously restorative weekly ritual. With my two kids – who, I know, will sooner or later decide to leave me to it – I spend most Sunday mornings rambling around where we live in Somerset. Given more time, we have also visited plenty of other places: Dartmoor, the Brecon Beacons, the South Downs that run parallel to the coast between Winchester and Eastbourne. But over the past two years, as Covid restrictions have kept us at home, our wellbeing has been bound up with the modest pleasures of exploring our immediate surroundings, and discovering things that were just outside the front door: ancient burial mounds, abandoned canals, the fascinating geography of the old Somerset coalfield. Rural walking is a habit I acquired from my dad, who was a keen mountaineer and the son of a south Welsh miner. He got the bug from his older brother, back in the days when access to the countryside was an issue brimming with the raw class politics dramatised by the mass trespass of 1932 at Kinder Scout in the Peak District – the amazing act of organised civil disobedience that led to the creation of the UK’s national parks, among other advances. The roots of rambling in this kind of activism – not to mention thousands of working-class lives – rather belie its latter-day reputation for being a thoroughly bourgeois pastime, and these radical undercurrents have never really gone away. In the everyday activities of local footpath preservation societies and local Ramblers branches, there is a constant echo of what brought the Kinder trespassers together, and how far there is still to go. After all, there is one unfinished story at the heart of modern walking: the so-called right to roam, and the contrast between its dire limitations in England and Wales and the way that Scotland has been opened up, a change that still meets plenty of obstruction. Five years ago, one beautifully symbolic story centred on the Aberdeenshire “golf resort” owned by Donald Trump. Freedom of information requests made by the investigative website the Ferret unearthed police documents relating to the Trump organisation’s attitude to public access: “Their belief is that the land is private and that they will be able to restrict access unconditionally,” one said. “This is obviously not the case and this is a potential area of conflict that will need to be managed diplomatically.” Almost by definition, walking any distance highlights the fundamentals of our relationship with our environment: small wonder, then, that something as seemingly innocent as a love of being outside and moving around still creates flashpoints. Walking is also the focus of a growing story about the politics of diversity, and what still needs to happen to make it a genuinely popular pursuit. Just before Christmas, I had a half-hour conversation with Cherelle Harding, a youth worker who lives in Coventry and has recently founded an organisation called Steppers UK, which aims to help “black, Asian and ethnic minority communities to build positive relationships with the outdoors”. For some years, she told me, she was a smitten rural walker, but she reached a point where “I was a bit annoyed that I didn’t see more black people out hiking”. She talked about “systemic and generational barriers” – among them the absence from images of the great outdoors of black and brown people, and the fact that her parents and grandparents’ generation “had come to a very hostile country – going to places like the countryside just isn’t something they would have done”. Her first taste of organised walking came via the inspirational group Black Girls Hike, founded in Manchester in 2019, and Steppers is about a similar ethos, made all the more vivid by people’s experience of the Covid crisis. “This has been a time when a lot of us have faced trauma, particularly people from black communities,” she said. “And what we’re doing is about joy.” Here, perhaps, is the beautifully simple key to why walking – in both rural and urban surroundings – connects with something very deep within the people who do it. As the writer and devout walker Iain Sinclair said, moving around on foot entails “opening up your system to the world, making the skin porous, [and] letting all the impressions pour through.” We all know what gets in the way: prejudice, traffic, locked gates, signs painted with the dread words “private – keep out”. I think also of those stories smattered through the past two years of overzealous police officers stopping people whose walking represented no threat to public health, and one of the few means of staying connected to a world beyond their four walls. Fresh air, inbuilt social distancing, and the modest wonders of getting from one point to the next: as an alternative to gloom and seclusion, who would argue with that?

12/26/2021,"New restrictions to control the spread of Omicron are coming in across large parts of the UK after Christmas, though Boris Johnson has yet to decide if he will impose fresh curbs in England. In Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, here are the rules that will apply.  From Boxing Day, a maximum of six people are allowed to meet in pubs, cinemas and restaurants in Wales. A total of 30 people are allowed at indoor events while 50 people will be permitted at outdoor events. Two-metre social distancing is required in public premises and offices, and nightclubs will close. The rules come into force from 6am. Restrictions begin on Boxing Day in Scotland, where indoor events are limited to 100 people standing or 200 people sitting, and outdoor events are capped at 500 people. One-metre social distancing will be enforced. From 27 December, there will be additional rules on household mixing. Groups must be limited to three households. There will also be social distancing of 1 metre enforced in hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants, as well as theatres, cinemas and gyms. Table service will be required in venues that serve alcohol. Nightclubs have been closed and indoor standing events are banned. Further restrictions come in from 27 December, when table service will be mandatory in pubs, cafes and restaurants. A maximum of six people will be permitted to be seated together in hospitality settings. More than six will be permitted if they all belong to a single household, as long as it is not more than 10. People are strongly advised to limit the number of contacts and to gather in groups of no more than three households. Ministers are expected to meet to discuss further restrictions on Monday – though there is no guarantee rules will change. Government sources have said they expect schools to remain open. The government has been given modelling by Sage scientists which look at the effects of returning to stage 2 restrictions – which include the closure of indoor hospitality but allow pubs and restaurants to serve outdoors, as well as a ban on indoor mixing in homes and a return to the rule of six outdoors. The models have examined imposing the measures for two weeks, four weeks and three months.",News/World news,"What are the new Covid rules in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/26/what-are-the-new-covid-rules-in-wales-scotland-and-northern-ireland
12/26/2021,"Post-Brexit changes to Britain’s immigration rules have triggered an unprecedented collapse in bookings for school trips from the continent, organisers say, with countries such as Ireland and the Netherlands now more popular than the UK. While the pandemic has depressed European school travel in general, the number of short-stay educational visits planned in 2022 to alternative EU destinations where English is widely spoken is significantly higher than inquiries for UK visits.  Operators say that while Britain’s day two Covid test requirement is a factor, by far the most significant is the UK’s decision not to accept EU group passports or identity cards from 1 October, instead requiring full passports – plus expensive individual visas for non-EU pupils. The British government has said the collapse is because of the pandemic and that the measures are needed “to strengthen the security of our border”, but critics say they are unnecessary for under-18s on short, organised trips with teachers. They argue the slump will deprive UK host families, hostels and attractions of valuable income, and also inflict longer-term damage since school trips can prove formative experiences, promoting intercultural exchange and forging greater mutual understanding. Eurovoyages, a big French school trips operator, said that as of last month it had received 53 requests for short-stay visits to Ireland next year, as well as others for the Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Austria and the Czech Republic. “We have received precisely two requests for the UK, one of which has already changed its mind and decided to visit Ireland,” said Monique Tissot Martel, the company’s general manager. “Schools have forgotten the UK was a destination.” Tissot Martel said that French schools wanting an English-speaking environment were even considering going to Normandy, where British host families and youth hostels with native speakers were offering immersive English stays. “It is really a shame, as trips to the UK were very popular,” she said. “In 2019 we sent more than 11,000 students to the UK. Next year it will be between zero and 100.” Peter Adam said his company, CTS Reisen in Lemgo, Germany, had sent more than 1,200 school groups and 37,000 pupils to the UK in 2019 but had had no firm bookings for 2022. About 80% of the company’s customers that regularly booked trips to the UK were choosing alternative destinations, he said. “The majority see the UK as too difficult now,” Adam said. Covid-19 restrictions were not the problem, he added, “even if they are tougher in the UK than in other European countries”, and parents were “often prepared to pay the extra cost of obtaining a full passport instead of an EU identity card”. The biggest issue was “the EU ‘list of travellers’ group passport, which is no longer valid for travelling to the UK”, he said. “About 4% of all pupils in Germany are not EU nationals. They can’t afford a visa. Teachers don’t like to leave them at home so are choosing other destinations”, such as Amsterdam or Copenhagen, he said. In the UK, Susan Jones of LinguaStay, a UK homestay accommodation provider that usually welcomes 10,000 continental schoolchildren a year into about 300 host families in Chester, said the slump was “absolutely dramatic”. Continental schools typically sent about a million pupils to the UK each year on organised trips, Jones said, with France and Germany alone accounting for 850,000. But for the February to June season, it was now clear that schools across the continent had “completely abandoned the UK for other countries”, she said. “These children learn English staying in host families,” she said. “They mix with the local community, take part in workshops such as drama and cookery, have integration days at local schools and guided tours of cities and tourist attractions. They travel off peak, which helps many smaller UK towns and businesses outside peak season.” Verdié Voyages, a French company that in 2019 sent 800 coachloads of schoolchildren to England, said it had received just 146 inquiries for UK trips next year, a fall of 80%. By contrast, inquiries for trips to Ireland were down only 40%. “Requests are down for all destinations because of Covid,” said Marie Bayol, the company’s accommodation manager. The slump in interest for the UK “is due to Brexit, a second impact that makes our main destination almost unsaleable”, she said. Edward Hisbergues of PG Trips, a French operator specialising in English-speaking countries, said that besides the passport and visa issue, business to the UK had fallen more sharply than elsewhere because of Britain’s day two test requirement. His company normally books 80% of school trips to the UK and 20% to Ireland. “For next year it is more like 10% of requests for the UK and everything else is focused on Ireland, even though it is more expensive,” he said. “You only need an EU identity card to travel there, for non-EU students the ‘list of travellers’ is still accepted, and as far as Covid is concerned the EU health pass is sufficient. People much prefer to pay a little more but not have all the UK constraints.” Jones said the sector was pushing for EU nationals coming to the UK on organised short school trips to be allowed to enter with an ID card, and for non-EU nationals travelling with them to enter with just a passport. “It just seems such a small gesture compared to the benefits,” she said. “Not just the economic benefit, but the soft power.” Morag Anderson of ETSUK, another British homestay company, said the government’s stance was shortsighted. “Give me a child at 12 years old on a school trip to the UK,” Anderson said, “and I give you a future higher education student, employee, researcher, entrepreneur, tourist – with family and friends … And a future parent, encouraging a future child to travel, work and study in the UK. Once this cycle is interrupted, there is no going back.”",News/Education,‘Almost unsaleable’: slump in school trips to UK blamed on Brexit ,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/26/school-trips-to-uk-slump-brexit
12/26/2021,"My grandfather was a man with a tut as loud as a dropped plate. He’d deploy it whenever you fell short in some way: a length of the pool finished too slowly; a garden bed not weeded well enough; a portion of vegetables left unfinished. But he softened over chess, a game he bequeathed to me over long sessions, played in our pyjamas by the fireplace. Across the board, his sternness would melt into a kind of pensive calm, the admonishments replaced with instructions and then a small smile when he saw the move that would win the game and send me to bed. He played chess all his life and was chairman of his local club right up until he entered the retirement home where he died, but I didn’t follow his example myself until some 25 years later. By then it was too late to thank him.  The moment came at around 6pm on New Year’s Day 2021. Lying alone on my living room carpet, watching the first rain drops of the year drizzle on to the window, all the adrenaline of the past 12 months seemed to evaporate, leaving behind an overwhelming sense of dread. Like everyone else, I’d made it to the end of 2020 only to find Covid wasn’t going anywhere, and now the thought of resuming what passed for “real life” towered over me like the biggest pile of dirty dishes – which, incidentally, was also waiting in the kitchen. Desperate for a distraction, I opened my laptop and logged into chess.com for the first time in years. With a heavy, hopeless sigh, I made the move drilled into me as my tiny primary school’s fourth best player, who was roundly beaten in the junior club semi-finals by Jason Wood in front of my father in 1992 – king’s pawn to E4. I was not alone. People all around the world were discovering chess. In the year after March 2020, chess.com picked up over 11 million new users, many no doubt inspired by Netflix’s The Queen’s Gambit. On live streaming apps, such as Twitch, blossoming communities of young chess players were revelling in the strange, shared language with which you can analyse and debate games. At a time of existential worry, something about a 1,500-year-old boardgame was drawing people in. One silver lining of Covid was the rapid development in our conversation about mental health. In Britain, this was something at least partially ignited by the sobering National Office of Statistics report in 2014 which named suicide, for the first time, as the number one killer of men under 50. The conversation kept simmering in subsequent years, with moments such as #MeToo, which made us reconsider the way victims process trauma, and then Donald Trump, a real-time experiment in untreated narcissism during which the game “would you go back in a time machine and kill baby Hitler” became replaced by “would you go back in a time machine and give baby Trump a hug”. But the pandemic was the moment for many of us when mental health went from the political to the abruptly personal. Family c onversations about my (other) grandfather – alive at the time, but on his own when lockdown started – changed quickly from keeping him physically well to how we could prevent him becoming depressed. Managers and HR departments, fearful of losing unseen staff to long-term stress, quickly learned the language of self-care. (“We just had an online seminar,” a newly evangelical 60-year-old neighbour and veteran of corporate finance told me, “called ‘It’s OK to not be OK.’”) Most of all, we had to learn coping mechanisms for ourselves. No matter where you sat on the “quite lucky, really!” continuum, Covid was a mental health challenge. For me, this meant increased bouts of acute anxiety, something I’ve experienced since childhood; an all-consuming dread, often coupled with extreme self-criticism, which makes it difficult to eat properly, sleep or feel optimism or joy. Searching for the right ways to cope had led to a skipping-in-the-garden phase, an ill-fated morning meditation regime, the month I became briefly but intensely obsessed with the teachings of Wim “the Iceman” Hof and started each day with loud breathing exercises and a cold shower (admittedly with more commitment to the former than the latter). Next came journaling – churning out pages and pages of stream-of-consciousness misery in an effort to purge my way to feeling better. Where I didn’t expect to find relief was in an ancient board game, which had previously left me so humbled and humiliated I’d retreat in frustration after a few days and swear off it for good. But this time something clicked. By the end of January, I was playing several games a week; 10 months later, I play at least three or four times a day. Chess, I quickly realised, was giving me far more than just a pleasant distraction. Instead, it was offering a window of clarity into my state of mind, a place where the fog of the day’s stresses and distractions were cleared to show me what was really going on, good or bad. My therapist had often told me: you need to find ways to tune into more of your emotions, not just anxiety but the rest of the “big four”; joy, sadness, and anger. Chess is an extremely fast route to experiencing them all – often within the course of a few moves. At a time when the outside world was too extreme to contemplate, it became a useful internal bellwether. If I was playing with frustration and impatience, I knew tackling that big problem at work or having that difficult conversation with a friend or partner was probably best left until tomorrow. If I was playing with grit and purpose, it clarified that I was strong and gave me the confidence to do what needed to be done elsewhere. In chess, there is no element of chance: no dice to throw, no bit of kit that can falter (unless the board splits in two, which is fairly unlikely), no adverse weather conditions to point to and curse. It is a pure test of your ability to master your thoughts and emotions in the moment; failure to make a good move is, ultimately, the only thing that leads to your downfall. This is why you punch the air when you win and feel unspeakably furious with yourself when you lose. In chess, there are no ways to downplay your victory or excuse your defeat. Then there is the obvious matter of resilience. Chess is a relentless, real-time test of your resolve. Can you make a mistake (called “blunders” in the game) – particularly the worst ones, like losing a queen – and keep going, or do you slam your laptop shut and be grumpy for the rest of the evening? Do you react to a setback by lashing out with an ill-considered attack, or can you take a breath, analyse the situation and make a smart move instead? Can you contain the joy of winning a clear advantage, and not get complacent? (Comebacks in chess are almost always about this.) Chess, in short, began to feel like a mindfulness exercise and an emotional HIIT class rolled into one. What was hard to tell was whether it was truly transformative, or whether I was merely projecting what I needed on to chess at that time, just as others were with birdwatching or baking. The traditional view of chess is that playing it will make us smarter, that its unique blend of arithmetic, geometry and lateral thinking offers a workout for the mind that will make us stronger at logic, strategy and problem-solving. Just as heavyweight boxers are used as shorthand for physical supremacy, chess players are considered the height of intelligence, if not genius. This is certainly the view in places such as Armenia, the only country in the world to make chess mandatory in school (resulting, unsurprisingly, in one of the world’s highest proportions of grandmasters). The problem is, this is a romantic fallacy with no scientific basis. At least that’s the conclusion of Fernand Gobet, author of The Psychology of Chess and an international master who once faced the great Garry Kasparov when part of the Swiss national team. A cognitive scientist and professor at Liverpool University, he has researched the question of chess’s relationship to intelligence. “About 15 years ago,” Gobet says, “someone from the US Chess Fan Federation asked me to research the benefits of chess on education. He told me: ‘I want the truth.’ They mailed me this big box full of about 90 studies into the topic. We realised pretty quickly they were almost all very poor quality with almost no methodology. Maybe five or six were usable.” Gobet set out to discover once and for all whether playing chess can have a positive impact on other areas of cognitive ability, particularly those that similarly combined “intelligence with working memory”. Unlike the studies in the box, Gobet and his team applied scientific conditions – properly sized control groups, placebos, standard deviations. “The conclusion we came to was that playing a lot of chess makes you very good at chess,” he says. “And no evidence for anything else.” You might think this would have sent shockwaves through the chess community, who’d been using this particular piece of propaganda for years. Instead, fingers were placed firmly in ears. “They basically totally ignored us,” Gobet says. “Every year I get invited to conferences and I often tell the same story. Sometimes they get sick of hearing it and talk about other things. There are still reports being published today claiming chess is great for mathematic intelligence, working memory capacity, Alzheimer’s – everything. But there’s no evidence.” Chess may not make us smarter in a cognitive sense, but what about the idea it can help us learn to understand and master our feelings better? “It’s possible,” Gobet says, “Although there’s absolutely no data about that.” He agrees chess is an unusually emotive game. “If you do an experiment and ask people to propose the best move in any position, they often use very emotional terms: ‘This move is disgusting, this move is lovely.’ Clearly, chess generates powerful emotions, especially when you’re losing. People hate losing at chess. You can speculate that chess teaches us a few simple things, like learning to lose graciously, to think before you move and so on. I think it’s more just a way to reveal innate abilities that people have. It’s going to reveal whether you’re resilient or not, if you can manage your emotions.” Or perhaps it can be a way to chart your personal growth in these things. The boy I was at 12, losing in front of my father, or the man I was at 26, writing it off as a waste of time after each defeat, were not as emotionally resilient as me today, whose Elo (chess-rating system) rating lingers stubbornly in the “class D” range (one step above total novice), but keeps playing anyway. This maturity may be unsurprising, but that doesn’t mean it is not worth observing: self-care is about celebrating and viewing yourself with kindness. Which leads me to another thing I value about chess. Beneath the cut and thrust of attack and defence, it is also a curious exercise in empathy – for yourself, but also your opponent. Even when you’re playing an anonymous stranger on the internet you can intuit something of their emotional state within a few moves: what opening they choose (or how they respond to yours); how quickly they move; how boldly they exchange material (pieces). Each game has a distinct texture and emotional arc. To the best of my knowledge, no one says this about Boggle. I asked my father once if my grandfather ever struggled with his mental health. Difficult or unpleasant emotions were taboo in my grandparent’s household. The only self-help they knew was the stiff upper lip, an example which has extended down the family like ivy covering a crumbling wall. He told me there had been a period when he was a child, not discussed during or since, when Grandad took to bed for weeks in a closed off room with what was euphemistically described by everyone at the time as “nerves”. I struggled to picture it. Later, when we cleared out his house, we found piles of Grandad’s chess books with pencil notes scribbled in the margins where he taught himself opening theories, just as today I spend hours watching “How to DESTROY opponents with the Sicilian Defence!” tutorials by Russian YouTubers. My grandfather lived and died before we had a shared language for the mental health struggles that are also part of his legacy to me, but chess was a journey he set me on which we undertook in the same way, decades apart. I would love to be able to ask him what relief, if any, he got from this infinitely joyful, endlessly maddening game; whether it was his refuge, too. Perhaps, like me, he appreciated how the game functions as a handy metaphor for life. You start with endless options laid out in front of you, fumble some of your earliest moves, battle through a complicated and difficult middle passage before, eventually, entering a final stretch in which the pieces and the clock start to run out. There will always be better players, silly blunders, missed wins. All you can do is make the best move you can, and when things really go wrong, try and find the will to reset the board and go again.

12/26/2021,"This superfluous Kingsman origin story sees writer-director Matthew Vaughn sketch a blueprint for the suited and booted secret spy organisation. The third film in the franchise, it begins with Ralph Fiennes’s Orlando Oxford, an aristocrat and widowed war veteran who regrets his part in plundering Britain’s colonies. A self-declared pacifist, he discourages his son Conrad (Harris Dickinson) from enlisting in the army – but the first world war has broken out and a global disaster must be stopped. Orlando is flanked by arse-kicking comrades played by Djimon Hounsou and Gemma Arterton (the only woman in the film offered anything resembling a speaking role). The tone lurches awkwardly from sweeping colonial melodrama to grim battle epic, camp, pseudo-Bond caper and crass, unfunny farce. All exist on a spectrum of tedious laddishness, from Rhys Ifans’s puerile Rasputin – a dancing, vomiting mystic monk – to a sombre, reverent set piece in the trenches. It’s a fun bit of historical revisionism when the war is revealed to have been masterminded by a shadowy villain with a Scottish accent, determined to topple the British empire while punishing Fiennes’s “posh prick”. Still, the film can’t resist revelling in a conservative conclusion outside Buckingham Palace, with a victory banner fluttering against a smattering of St George’s flags.
