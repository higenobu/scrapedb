4/5/2022,"Donald Trump has admitted he did not win the 2020 election. “I didn’t win the election,” he said. The admission came in a video interview with a panel of historians convened by Julian Zelizer, a Princeton professor and editor of a forthcoming history of Trump’s presidency. The interview was published on Monday by the Atlantic. Describing his attempts to make South Korea pay more for US military assistance, Trump said Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president, was among the “happiest” world leaders after the 2020 US election put Joe Biden in the White House. “By not winning the election,” Trump said, “he was the happiest man – I would say, in order, China was – no, Iran was the happiest. “[Moon] was going to pay $5bn, $5bn a year. But when I didn’t win the election, he had to be the happiest – I would rate, probably, South Korea third- or fourth-happiest.” Trump also said “the election was rigged and lost”. Trump’s refusal to accept defeat by Biden fueled both attempts to overturn results in key states in court – the vast majority of such cases ending in defeat – and the deadly attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. Trump was impeached for a second time, for inciting an insurrection, and acquitted for a second time after enough Senate Republicans stayed loyal. Trump thus remains free to run for the White House again in 2024, which he has constantly hinted he will do. Writing for the Atlantic, Zelizer said Trump “was the one who had decided to reach out to a group of professional historians so that we produced ‘an accurate book’”. The former president called the historians assembled by Zelizer “a tremendous group of people, and I think rather than being critical I’d like to have you hear me out, which is what we’re doing now, and I appreciate it”. Trump, Zelizer wrote, “seemed to want the approval of historians, without any understanding of how historians gather evidence or render judgments”. Zelizer also pointed out that shortly after the session with the historians, Trump announced he would give no more interviews for books about his time in office. “It seems to me that meeting with authors of the ridiculous number of books being written about my very successful administration, or me, is a total waste of time,” Trump said in a statement, in July 2021. “These writers are often bad people who write whatever comes to their mind or fits their agenda. It has nothing to do with facts or reality.”",Arts/Books,‘I didn’t win the election’: Trump admits defeat in session with historians,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/05/trump-admits-election-defeat-historians-zelizer-princeton
4/5/2022,"Whether it’s chips, stir-fry or curry on the menu, the financial shock from the war in Ukraine is being felt keenly in the kitchen as cooking oil prices hit record highs. The cost had already rocketed even before Vladimir Putin’s invasion, but now vegetable oil goes for £1.30 a litre at the supermarket, up 23p, or 22%, on a year ago. Sunflower oil – of which Ukraine and Russia are major producers – is up sharply too, by 17p to £1.34 a litre, according to NielsenIQ Scantrack data. Three out of four households buy cooking oil, and in the UK they spend almost £400m a year on the stuff. Shoppers stock up every eight to 10 weeks, says NielsenIQ’s Mike Watkins, meaning there could be “shelf shock for many” when they return. Besides being a cupboard staple, cooking oil is used throughout the food industry – from biscuits to ready meals to long-life cream – so cost rises and shortages have knock-on effects. This week, the UK’s biggest bottler of sunflower oil warned stocks were running low with only a few weeks’ worth left, and it emerged manufacturers of products that rely on it, such as crisps and oven chips, were being forced to change their recipes and use other types of oil. Home cooks may cope with higher prices by changing their cooking method or trading down to cheaper supermarket own-label oils. However, for restaurants and food companies that use huge quantities of cooking oil, shortages and price increases are adding to the pressure caused by other rising costs. Yawar Khan, who owns Akash Tandoori in Wallington in south London, says last month a 20-litre drum of vegetable oil cost about £22 at the cash-and-carry, but today the price is closer to £40. Buyers have also been limited to two drums each, in a sign of concerns about shortages. So how did the price of this kitchen essential get so high? Ukraine and Russia account for about 60% of world production of sunflower oil, and the conflict has hit supplies hard. In UK stores sunflower oil is about a fifth of the market by value and 44% by volume, according to NielsenIQ. It is one of the “big four” vegetable oils, ranked behind palm, soya bean and rapeseed in that order (oil sold as “vegetable oil” is a blend of various seeds). When the supply of one of the big four is interrupted, it triggers a scrabble to buy a substitute. The price of sunflower oil jumped 60% after the invasion of Ukraine, from £1,130 per tonne in February to over £1,800 in March, according to analysts at Mintec. This had a knock-on effect on prices for palm, rapeseed and soya bean oil. The war has trapped millions of tonnes of sunflower oil earmarked for foreign buyers in Ukraine, causing a major supply shock. “Overnight we had a situation where the market couldn’t offer because supplies weren’t coming from Ukraine into the EU and being processed, or from Ukraine to other countries around the world,” says Gary Lewis, of oil importer KTC Edibles. “The big impact in the UK and EU has been on rapeseed oil – as you can imagine, prices went absolutely crazy.” The next few weeks will be key. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, has encouraged those farmers not directly affected by the war to plant as much as possible, with the optimal time several weeks away. “If there is a ceasefire we will be able to assess what stocks are left in the country and when they’ll become available,” says Lewis. “The uncertainty is what has caused the panic-buying.” The pandemic’s rolling lockdowns fractured a delicately balanced global supply chain. From farmers to factories, freight handlers and retailers, the crisis caused huge upheaval and triggered see-sawing levels of demand. One big casualty was the palm oil harvest in Malaysia, the world’s second largest producer. Yields tumbled to a near 40-year low after it closed its doors to migrant workers who usually bring it in. At the start of the pandemic palm oil was changing hands for about £500 a tonne, according to Mintec. A year in it was up 50%. Today it heads towards £1,300 a tonne, pushing up the cost of manufacturing everything that uses it, from cakes and biscuits to cosmetics, shampoo and washing powder. Vito Martielli, senior analyst for grains and oilseeds at Rabobank, says the “stocks-to-use” ratio – a gauge of the health of the global vegetable oil market – has been falling for eight years, from about 16% in 2015, the equivalent of 58 days of supply, to about 12%, or 44 days. In the past, the global market would see big supply shocks every five to seven years, but in the past 10 years these have become much more frequent, with climatic conditions like drought and frost and sometimes disease affecting crops more often, says Martielli. In 2021 farmers in Canada, the biggest producer and exporter of rapeseed, had a disastrous growing season after temperatures soared to almost 50C. The soya bean oil price is marching up at the moment due to the smaller harvests expected from growers in Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay – which account for more than 50% of world supply – after severe drought. Last year drought in Ukraine and Russia propelled sunflower oil prices to a 12-year high of nearly £1,200 a tonne – although that record has been obliterated by financial shock of the war. “Over the last couple of years we have seen lots of crop problems around the world,” adds Lewis. “The high temperatures in Canada had a massive impact on rapeseed production, which had an impact on EU prices, because these ripples travel across the world.” Biofuels account for about 15% of global demand for vegetable oil, according to Rabobank. This use, as countries seek to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, has previously been blamed for pushing up food prices. Ariel Brunner, head of EU policy at BirdLife International, an environmental NGO, recently told New Scientist: “We are literally burning a hell of a lot of food.” Governments had the power to change this because the biofuel market was entirely driven by subsidies, he added. The loss of Ukraine and Russia’s sunflower oil could be mitigated by diverting crops away from fuel tanks. This would help to reduce food prices, a move that would benefit those on the lowest incomes the most. Lewis says that 50%-60% of the rapeseed grown in Europe, and 60% of the palm oil imported by the region, goes into biodiesel. “Over the last 20 years the increase in demand for biodiesel has stimulated production but there is always going to be a crunch point where you get the debate over fuel versus food,” he says. There was an argument for temporarily suspending the use of edible oils in biodiesel due to the current crisis, he said. “This would have a dramatic impact on the availability for the food industry and alleviate some of the pressures.” “We haven’t put our prices up yet but we are thinking about it,” says Khan, who says increases of 10% to 15% will be required this month to cover his restaurant’s higher running costs. Khan, who is also the chair of the Asian Catering Federation, says his restaurant uses 40 litres of oil a week but larger venues could get through 100 litres. The biggest concern of the group’s members, he says, is that they are reluctant to increase prices to cover the increase in overheads for fear of “pricing out” would-be diners. “If the eating out bill goes up £10 or £20, how many times are you going to visit your local restaurant or order takeaway?” His restaurant’s economics are also being affected by the soaring cost of chicken, spices and spiralling wages, which are up by 15%-20% this year.",News/Business,Oil crisis: global forces fuel food price rises amid Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/05/food-price-rises-ukraine-war-cooking-oil
4/5/2022,"After two years online, the Hay festival has announced the full programme for its first in-person spring literary festival since 2019. This year the gathering that Bill Clinton once called “the Woodstock of the mind” will have more than 500 live events, welcoming Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon and lockdown sensation Joe Wicks to its tents in the Welsh border town Hay-on-Wye. Booker winners Damon Galgut and Bernardine Evaristo are among those in the lineup, along with Julian Barnes, Monica Ali and Deborah Levy. And the author of A Poem for Every Day of the Year, Allie Esiri, is to present an afternoon of poetry with Inua Ellams, Stephen Fry, Damian Lewis and others. Hay has also teamed up with Letters Live again, which runs events where remarkable letters from history are read by a diverse array of performers. Benedict Cumberbatch will be leading the all-star cast of readers to raise money for the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. Now in its 35th year, this will be the first festival since Hay’s co-founder and former director Peter Florence resigned from his role after a bullying claim was upheld last year. He said at the time he was “incredibly proud” of what the festival had achieved during his years at the helm, and hoped it would continue to “go from strength to strength”. The 11-day festival will take place from 26 May to 5 June, running across the specially extended Queen’s platinum jubilee bank holiday weekend. The occasion will be marked by a series of conversations on the theme “Women & Power”, with speakers including Sturgeon, Labour MP Jess Phillips and former president of the supreme court Lady Hale. Another series of talks labelled “Imagine …” will see writers and thinkers including Elif Shafak, Simon Schama and AC Grayling discuss global issues, focusing on four themes: democracy, equality, science and nature. Meanwhile the 10@10 series will showcase a different debut writer at 10am each day, and Guardian Live will be presenting a trio of events. As well as ideas, there will be music from Corinne Bailey Rae, Kate Rusby and Danilo Pérez, and a platinum jubilee concert by Rebecca Evans, Leah-Marian Jones, Trystan Llŷr Griffiths and Bryn Terfel. Attendees will also be able to enjoy comedy from Bill Bailey, Nina Conti and Simon Amstell. Hay festival international director Cristina Fuentes La Roche said: “It’s been 35 years since writers and readers started sharing their stories together in our festival tents and we have never needed these stories more urgently.” She added: “During the day our conversations and debates will tackle some of the biggest issues of the moment, and in the evenings we’ll laugh and dance together again.” Hay festival 2022 is supported by lead sponsors Baillie Gifford and Visit Wales. Tickets are on sale to Friends of Hay festival now, and public booking opens on 8 April. Digital passes, which will offer a curated selection of livestreamed events from the festival, will go on sale on 2 May.",Arts/Books,Hay festival returns with its first in-person event for three years,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/05/hay-festival-returns-with-its-first-in-person-event-for-three-years
4/5/2022,"Much of the energy that erupted after the murder of George Floyd seems to have been hijacked by a brand of “antiracism” overconcerned with microaggressions, with representation in film and media, and with interpersonal relationships. It’s a framework that largely ignores economic inequality, or the potential for strategic, organised struggle. Instead, the emphasis is placed on the insistence that if we just make white people nicer and encourage them to do better through a combination of demanding, begging or cajoling – all the while obsessively documenting a catalogue of personal privileges between individuals based purely on whether they are “white”, “black” or “brown” – that we are “doing the work”. Ahistoric and devoid of class analysis, this brand of activism doesn’t have the tools to address the shitshow that recently took place at Jay-Z’s annual Oscars Gold party at the Chateau Marmont hotel. Workers – many of them working-class black and brown Americans – at the ultra-exclusive Marmont have been protesting over abhorrent working conditions. The Hollywood Reporter has spoken with at least 30 workers who reported “long-simmering workplace issues, including allegations of systemic racial discrimination and sexual misconduct”. (In a statement, the hotel’s lawyers responded that: “Workplace issues are regularly raised, as at any business, and swiftly investigated and addressed,” and said employees have access to a whistleblower line to report any problems.) The hotel’s owner, André Balazs, laid off most of his employees during the early stages of the pandemic, without providing severance packages or extended health insurance. The Unite Here Local 11 union has been loudly boycotting the hotel since 2021, accusing it of “disrespect, mistreatment and a racially stratified workplace”. Upon hearing of the forthcoming Oscars party, Unite Here made public appeals to Jay-Z to acknowledge the boycott. Despite the massed protesters outside the venue, and despite the picket line bristling with placards, the extravagant party went ahead. Meanwhile, the newly dreadlocked (do pause to consider the hairstyle’s countercultural connotations) billionaire alongside his diamond-bedecked wife – the Queen, Beyoncé – has been increasingly speaking a language of #activism. The pair were feted for accepting a Brit award while posed in front of a portrait of Meghan Markle, Jay-Z has been declared rap’s “leading good Samaritan” for his support of the incarcerated celebrity rappers Meek Mill and 21 Savage, and Bey has supplied a stream of perfectly viral moments, from her rousingly “problack” Oscars performance to her Black Panther performance at the Super Bowl and last year’s “empowering” Black Is King visual album. Yet all of this showy “representation”, packaging the energy of the Black Lives Matter movement in beautifully styled morsels, changes little. Especially when, confronted with the opportunity to support actual change, holding a party in lavish surroundings wins out. The Hollywood Reporter listed Janelle Monáe, Saweetie, Emily Ratajkowski, Kim Kardashian West, Micheal B Jordan and Zoë Kravitz among those who attended the event. While the picket line undertook the hard work of actual activism outside the party, the fun and games of those who “represent” us went ahead inside, untroubled by such inconvenient demands. The contradiction of billionaire “activist” celebrities crossing a picket line was almost entirely ignored in the post-Oscars discussion. Instead, it was the “celebrity slap” that generated currency: the incident in which millionaire Hollywood actor Will Smith smacked the Oscars host, millionaire Hollywood comedian Chris Rock, for making an inappropriate joke about Will’s wife, millionaire Hollywood actor Jada Pinkett Smith. In a glaring indictment of our current priorities, commentators obsess over the foibles of the megarich while workers struggle to live. Not only is representation not an instant remedy for racism, the Chateau Marmont incident itself, as well as the silence around it, remains a stark example of how “representation politics” can actually distract from truly emancipatory politics. It demonstrates that the “antiracist” world so often referenced since 2020 will not be achieved without class analysis, no matter how many black films Hollywood makes. The episode also demonstrates how many people are more than happy to use the language of diversity, inclusion and antiracism – from A-listers to aspirant “influencer activists” – even if the effects end up serving not collective liberation, but personal ambition. As Symeon Brown writes in BlackLivesMatter Here’s My Ca$h App, a chapter of his new book Get Rich or Lie Trying: “Social media incentivises competition and disincentivises collectivism.” This is a politics of competition, not solidarity. Many influencer-activists purport to represent their online communities but it is the individuals themselves who are the primary beneficiaries rather than their followers, who are left with little more substantive than being “represented” or feeling “seen”. But look beyond the activist-influencer matrix and it’s not all bad news. Away from the black squares, hashtags and manufactured outrage of online #activism, we have seen a return to grassroots labour organisation that has started to reap results. This week the Amazon workers of Staten Island voted through proposals – long opposed by founder Jeff Bezos – to form the US’s first Amazon workers’ union. With former Amazon employee Chris Smalls at the helm, they have against the odds managed to tap into a tradition of collective action to fight back against short breaks and high injury rates – something that will greatly benefit the largely minority ethnic workforce. I wrote What White People Can Do Next (which is in many ways a critique of the limitations of liberal mainstream antiracism, disguised as a self-help book for white people) partly because I wanted to reconnect our current moment with the work of an earlier generation of activists who were not competing for likes, shares and “visibility”. Rather, they were part of a black radical tradition described by the scholar Cedric Robinson as emerging from a split in the black community. On one side, there were those with “a liberal, bourgeois consciousness … packed with capitalist ambitions and individualist intuitions”. Their objective was essentially to gain access to the roles and rewards monopolised by white people. On the other side, “There was a radical proletarian consciousness that sought to realise a higher moral standard than the ones embraced by whites and their black imitators.” Where is our solidarity with the workers at Chateau Marmont? Why can’t a fraction of the attention that we reserve for celebrities be spared for the protesters? What I am certain of is that, in the words of Cedric Johnson, “Any movement that does not address economic inequality serves primarily as theatre, not strategy.” Robin Kelley, a professor of American history, has described the “rise of a black political class that serves as junior partners in forms of authoritarian governance”. A school of antiracism that holds up the visibility of these figures as evidence that things are “getting better” is part of the problem, not the solution.

4/5/2022,"The inscription on the memorial bench opposite the bus stop where the 18-year-old woman was grabbed by her killer is heartfelt and devastating: “In loving memory of Bobbi-Anne McLeod,” it says. “Shine Brightly Our Angel.” The teenager’s relatives have left a heart, a bear and a butterfly next to the bench with messages of love and loss. A magnolia tree with deep purple flowers has been planted in McLeod’s memory on the verge and friends have scattered roses in the grass. Five months after McLeod was snatched off this Plymouth street by Cody Ackland, a stranger to her, emotions are still raw. There is not only sadness but anger and confusion. Many girls and young women remain wary of walking around after dark; activists continue to campaign to make the city safer; people are still waiting for an explanation for this explosion of violence. McLeod was on her way to see her boyfriend on 20 November, a damp Saturday evening. Just before 6pm, she walked the few hundred yards from her family’s terrace house in the suburb of Leigham to the Sheepstor Road bus stop, planning to catch the No 50 into the city. A neighbour noticed her because she was dressed distinctively in ripped jeans with tights underneath and he was worried that someone so young looking was out and about alone. Though she was 18, McLeod was less than 5ft tall and could have been mistaken for a girl of 15. Shortly after the neighbour saw her, 24-year-old Ackland pulled up and bundled McLeod into his vehicle, her headphones and tobacco falling to the pavement. He carried out a savage attack, striking her repeatedly and over a prolonged period with a blunt instrument. He is believed to have attacked her at the bus stop and then at other locations. Ackland then drove to Bovisand Beach, a popular party spot for young Plymothians. In May last year – six months before the attack – Ackland posted a picture of a roaring driftwood fire on the beach with the caption: “Capture them moments.” He hid McLeod’s body in woods near the beach that are popular with fly-tippers and made his escape. The alarm was raised when McLeod did not reach her destination, her family deeply worried because it was so out of character for her to vanish. Local people joined the police to search. Her older brother, Lee, was sure she had been kidnapped, pleading: “I’m begging everyone single person in Plymouth help me search everywhere, search everything. Someone has my sister.” Police were mystified. The abduction of an adult, albeit a young and small one, off a street at teatime is unusual. They searched woods and fields and began to interview known sex offenders in the area. On Tuesday 23 November – three days after McLeod vanished – Ackland walked into a police station and gave himself up. He told officers where her body was and began to reveal his actions. Detectives were shocked at the ferocity of the attack and the sort of person in front of them. Ackland seemed an ordinary young man from a respectable family with a good circle of friends and a talent for music. Very unusually for a stranger killer, he had no history of violence. He told officers what he had done – but gave no coherent reason why. Ackland was born in June 1997 in Germany, where his father, David, a soldier, was posted. His parents split up when he was a child and at the time of the killing he lived with his mother, Helen, in the Southway area of the city, about two and half miles from McLeod’s home. As a boy, Ackland attended Tor Bridge high school – as McLeod did – but the six-year age gap means they almost certainly did not know each other there. After school, Ackland did various jobs but music was his passion, and he became the lead guitarist and songwriter for Plymouth indie band Rakuda. As police tried to understand what had happened, the tributes poured in for McLeod. Lee McLeod posted a picture on Facebook of himself and his sister as children and wrote: “I love you. You didn’t deserve this. Such a beautiful and talented girl. Now go rest easy.” The teenager’s mother, Donna McLeod, said she would never be forgotten. When Ackland appeared at Plymouth crown court in January amid tight security, dozens of relatives, friends and supporters of the McLeod family attended, some with placards reading: “Justice for Bobbi-Anne”, “She was only 18” and “End Violence Against Women”. It emerged that Ackland was not denying what he had done but seeking to argue that he was suffering an “abnormality of the mind” at the time of the attack. Psychiatrists examined him in prison but found no mental illness that would allow this defence in court. Friends have said that as a boy he had contact with children’s mental health services but is not thought to have had known psychiatric problems as an adult. On Tuesday Ackland appeared again in court to plead guilty to murder. He is due to be sentenced in May, when the full facts of his crime will be set out. And – perhaps – some explanation given.",News/UK news,Emotions still raw after mystifying death of Bobbi-Anne McLeod,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/05/bobbi-anne-mcleod-emotions-raw-mystifying-death-cody-ackland
4/5/2022,"A 24-year-old rock musician has admitted murdering 18-year-old Bobbi-Anne McLeod, who disappeared from a bus stop in Devon in November last year. Cody Ackland grabbed McLeod, who was less than 5ft tall and looked younger than her age, off the street near her home in Plymouth, drove her away and carried out a prolonged attack on her with a blunt instrument before hiding her body in woods on a lane down to a beach. A huge search was launched after McLeod did not turn up to meet her boyfriend. Ackland walked into a police station three days after the attack and told police where to find the young woman’s body and what he had done. The pair were not known to each other and the motive for the attack remains unclear but it is believed Ackland used violence to get her into his vehicle and then beat her repeatedly. The killing sparked marches, candlelit vigils and calls for urgent measures to make the streets of Plymouth safer for women. A commission to examine violence against women and girls has been launched. It came three months after another tragedy in Plymouth when Jake Davison, a 22-year-old apprentice crane operator who harboured extreme misogynistic views, killed five people with a shotgun before turning the weapon on himself. McLeod was last seen at 6pm on Saturday 20 November at a bus stop close to her home in the Leigham area. The alarm was raised when she did not reach her destination and police, family and friends began to search for her. Her headphones and tobacco were found at the bus stop, suggesting she had been abducted. On 23 November Ackland gave himself up, telling police McLeod’s body was in woods close to Bovisand Beach, seven miles from where the teenager went missing. Ackland lived with his mother in the Southway area of the city, about two and half miles from McLeod’s home. He was the lead guitarist and songwriter for the Plymouth indie rock band Rakuda. Ackland is to be sentenced next month, at which point the full facts of the case will be given.

4/5/2022,"Distraught families across El Salvador are searching for information on the fate of their loved ones after almost 6,000 people were arrested in an unprecedented security crackdown over the past week. Men, women and children have been rounded up across the Central American country since the government declared a state of emergency on 27 March, suspending constitutional rights including the presumption of innocence. President Nayib Bukele, an authoritarian populist who uses Twitter to announce policies and denounce his enemies, has said that the detainees are all gang members and that they will not be released. The state of emergency was declared after three days of violence left 87 dead, which Bukele blamed on the Mara Salvatrucha gang known as MS-13. While the police claim to have captured the MS-13 leaders who ordered the killings, there is mounting evidence that ordinary people who live or work in gang-dominated neighbourhoods have been arrested arbitrarily. In the capital, San Salvador, hundreds of wives and mothers have been gathering outside a navy base that houses one the largest police holding cells. Vans loaded with handcuffed detainees arrived throughout the week as members of an evangelical church handed out small cups of sherbet to tearful relatives camped out in the baking sun. Carmen Rodríguez, 33, does not know why her husband, brother and nephew were arrested a week ago while unloading a truck of secondhand clothes for their business at the city’s main market in the historic quarter. “When we asked the police why they were taking them, they just insulted us,” said Rodríguez, who is struggling to find the money to pay for their meals. “They are taking the righteous for sinners. It is good for the police to do their job, but it is unfair that they also take away working people – and even worse that they treat them like animals,” she said. Last week Bukele announced on Twitter that food for gang inmates would be rationed to feed the new detainees as he wasn’t prepared to take money from the education budget to feed “terrorists”. The 30-day state of emergency allows detainees to be held for 15 days – rather than the usual three – without access to a defence attorney and without prosecutors having to make a case in front of a judge. The decree, which also allows police to search cellphones and messages, could be extended. The national assembly, which is controlled by Bukele’s allies, also passed legislation increasing jail terms for juveniles and allowed indefinite pre-trial detention for suspected gang members. Zaira Navas, a lawyer at the Salvadoran human rights group Cristosal, said: “The detainees have lost their right to defence and do not have the right to know the reasons for their arrest.” Despite the wide scope of the new emergency powers, reports suggest that other constitutional rights are also being violated. Rosa López said police forced their way into her house in Santa Tecla in the La Libertad region on Saturday 26 March and arrested her 20-year-old cousin who suffers from a heart condition. He should have been assigned a lawyer and appeared in court after three days as he was arrested a day before the state of emergency, but he remains incommunicado. “The police didn’t ask, they just entered the house and took him away. They were crazy that day, capturing everyone … It is terrible what they are doing to him and to us. It is not only unfair but it is also illegal,” said López, 26. The crackdown is popular with many voters who are fed up with the gangs, but has led to the lockdown of entire neighbourhoods. At a military checkpoint one afternoon last week in Santa Tecla, soldiers armed with AK-47s examined vehicles and checked people’s identity cards and proof of address before letting them in or out of the neighbourhood. Anyone regarded as suspicious was forced to strip, so troops could check for gang-related tattoos. Only those deemed to have a legitimate reason to be out and about could pass. “Builders and informal workers can’t leave. They are locked up, prisoners. Luckily I have a formal job and [my employer] has issued a letter. But if we want to go out shopping after work we can’t. There is nothing we can do,” said a 35-year-old woman who preferred not to give her name. Astrid Valencia, Central America researcher at Amnesty International, said: “We are alarmed not only that the measures suspend fundamental elements of due process, but also by President Bukele’s confrontational discourse, which stigmatises and attacks human rights defenders, civil society organisations, international NGOs and independent media for expressing their concerns about those measures.” Bukele has taken an increasingly combative stance with anyone daring to question his government, and recently claimed that human rights NGOs, the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and George Soros’s Open Society Foundations – which provides grants to NGOs and independent media in El Salvador – are gang associates. Ha quedado claro quiénes son los socios de los pandilleros.Todos han salido a defenderlos:Financistas, narcos, políticos y jueces corruptos, ONGs de “derechos humanos”, la “comunidad internacional”, la CIDH, periodistas y medios de Open Society, etc.Se quitaron la máscara. Even before the mass arrests, El Salvador had one of the most overcrowded prison systems in the world, with about a quarter of detainees being held in pre-trial detention. While mayor of San Salvador, Bukele claimed to support socially driven crime prevention and rehabilitation programs to tackle the country’s intractable gang violence. Since coming into power in 2019, he has reverted to the same mano dura or repressive tactics of previous governments, while at the same time secretly negotiating a truce with gang leaders, according to the US. Bukele denies the allegations, but the telephones of journalists reporting on the negotiated truce were hacked using Israeli spyware.

4/5/2022,"Tuesday’s planned tongue surgery was supposed to leave three-year-old Madoc breathing a little easier. Instead, he returned home after the procedure was postponed for the second time in 10 months. A surgeon at the Westmead children’s hospital told his distraught mother, Kelsey Boivin, that it could not go ahead as there were no ICU beds left. Madoc has Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome – a condition that has caused him to develop an oversized tongue and has resulted health issues including sleep apnea, which leads to him waking up about 20 times an hour. “The surgery was to try and help open up his airway, because he doesn’t breathe well,” Boivin said. Madoc is one of tens of thousands of people across New South Wales waiting for elective surgeries due compounding impacts from the pandemic, including the mass furloughing of staff and the summer pause on surgery when Omicron cases surged. In December, there were 94,807 people on the elective surgery waitlist. Experts predict that number would have increased since then and want to see state and federal governments act now to speed up the return to normal functioning. Madoc’s surgery was first planned for last June, after spending time on the waiting list. A new date was set when elective surgeries resumed this year. Boivin pulled Madoc’s older brother, six-year-old Beau, out of school so that no one contracted Covid before the long-awaited procedure. Boivin organised help and took time off work. “You plan your whole life around that – you do the PCR test three days before, jump through all of the hoops and then it doesn’t happen,” Boivin said. “It’s a massive life thing – emotionally, financially, everything, trying to get ready for it each time.” A spokesperson for the Children’s hospital at Westmead said it had dealt with a “significant number” of trauma and emergency cases on Monday evening that affected ICU and surgical capacity – at a time when more than 200 staff were in isolation. “The decision to reschedule non-urgent surgery is never made lightly and only applies in cases where it has been deemed clinically safe and appropriate,” the spokesperson said. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Omar Khorshid, has repeatedly raised concerns about the affects of ballooning wait times for surgeries. “As that waiting time blows out to beyond a year, then there’s a very, very severe impact on those individuals lives and the lives of their families,” he said, citing concerns over prolonged times for some people on pain management drugs and people being forced to take time off work. Korshid predicted a “disaster” in winter, due to a likely rise in flu cases, further spread of Covid and severe staff burnout. “It paints a pretty worrying picture for this upcoming winter,” he said. He said the federal government should take a leadership role to sort out the issue, which is being felt in every state and territory. “It’s going to be a real challenge to actually catch up, because our system doesn’t have the capacity to do more,” he said. “While some short-term measures are warranted to try and get on top of the surgical waiting lists, we also have to look at the longer term picture of what is the correct capacity for our public hospital system going forward.” This week the Victorian government announced a $1.5bn investment to reduce the elective surgery waitlist by boosting capacity by a quarter, with 40,000 extra surgeries to take place in the next year. But Korshid said “doctors and nurses don’t grow on trees”, and a plan like that would require workforce planning. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons NSW chair, Payal Mukherjee, said there should be a longer term vision from governments and expressed concern about workforce issues after two years of interrupted learning. “We have to keep making sure that training is not disrupted … it doesn’t just have the issue of stress and burnout on the junior workforce but it has an impact on workforce supply,” she said. The ear, nose and throat surgeon said high numbers of Covid cases had also made it hard to get through daily surgery lists, as many patients were testing positive right before their appointments. “That unpredictability – not even being able to use the resources that we have efficiently – that has a huge impact,” Mukherjee said. Staffing shortages are also wrecking havoc, with 4,424 NSW healthcare workers in isolation as of Monday. NSW Health is looking to partner with private hospitals as a possible short term solution, according to the head of the Australian Private Hospitals Association, Michael Roth. “There is a working group that’s been set up by the department with the private hospitals in [the] state to look at a sort of framework for using private hospitals to address some of that public backlog,” he said. Roth said that could be part of the solution, but there should also be work done at a federal level to make it easier to hire medical professionals from overseas. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning NSW Health said it is continuing to use a “staged approach to increasing surgical activity in public hospitals” to balance the needs of people having access to surgery with the affects of the ongoing pandemic. A spokesperson said progress was being made in the arrangements with private hospitals over elective surgery to reduce “reliance on temporary suspensions of non-urgent surgery in managing future waves of Covid-19”. “NSW Health thanks the community for its patience during this challenging period and remains committed to ensuring non-urgent elective procedures that were delayed during the temporary suspensions are performed as quickly as possible,” they said. For patients like Madoc, the wait continues. “There’s no way to quantify or qualify what this delay might mean for him,” Boivin said. “We know that there are policies in place to prioritise the most urgent need, but we’ve had over 500 days waiting, of waking up 20 times an hour every night.”",News/Australia news,Long delays for elective surgery take their toll ahead of winter ‘disaster’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/long-delays-for-elective-surgery-take-their-toll-ahead-of-winter-disaster
4/5/2022,"The official list of Covid-19 symptoms on the NHS has been extended to cover nine new symptoms, including sore throat, fatigue and headache and comes days after the provision of free testing kits for the public came to an end. The latest moves, combined with the lack of rules on masks and vague guidance on self-isolating, has left some wondering how to navigate the latest wave of infections. The government has updated its official list of Covid-19 symptoms on the NHS to include nine new symptoms, that join the previous three of a fever, a new and persistent cough, and a loss or change in taste or smell, according to nhs.uk. Extending the list may help reduce infections by helping people detect whether they may have Covid; however, it coincides with the end of the offer of free universal Covid-19 tests in England to help people confirm whether they have the virus. The new signs are: Shortness of breath. Feeling tired or exhausted. An aching body. A headache. A sore throat. A blocked or runny nose. Loss of appetite. Diarrhoea. Feeling sick or being sick. A note on the website states: “The symptoms are very similar to symptoms of other illnesses, such as colds and flu.” The latest data from the Zoe app suggests the most common current symptom for those with Covid is a runny nose (reported by eight out of 10 people), followed by fatigue, a sore throat, headache and sneezing. Far fewer people are reporting an altered sense of taste or smell in the latest wave. The official end of free testing kits (although they have been hard to come by for some time) means people who are not shielding have to pay about £2 a test from a chemist or supermarket. There is no legal requirement to test, but given that Covid symptoms overlap with seasonal respiratory infections and hay fever, without testing there is no clear way to know if you’re infected. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, suggests taking a test, if possible, if you have symptoms. “I’d partly do this because once I’ve had it, I’ll be more comfortable about my risk going forward,” he said. While for most individuals Covid is now less of a risk than seasonal flu, this is not the case for everybody – older people and those who are immunocompromised remain at particular risk. This is especially the case for those who had their last vaccine dose six months ago and are now due a booster. So testing before meeting indoors with people who may be at greater risk is worth considering – especially until the next rollout of booster doses. For children, the advice is that testing is not recommended unless you are directed to do so by a health professional. Masks are no longer mandatory, but there is evidence that they reduce transmission in crowded indoor spaces and when in prolonged proximity to others, such as on public transport. The extra layer of protection also means that if you are exposed to Covid, you are likely to receive a lower dose of the virus, which could reduce the severity of symptoms you experience if infected. “The evidence for this isn’t cast-iron, but it’s likely to be the case,” said Hunter. For many, there is also an element of etiquette. “If I go into a shop and it’s crowded I’ll put on a face covering,” said Hunter. “If it’s not really crowded but lots of other people are wearing masks, I’ll still put one on as a courtesy. I don’t want to make people feel uncomfortable and there will be people who will feel they have to carry on wearing masks to be safer.” There is no longer a legal requirement for people to test or self-isolate, but if you have any of the main symptoms or a positive test result, the public health advice is to stay at home, avoid contact with other people and to try to work from home. For children, the advice is that those with mild symptoms (runny nose, slight cough) can continue to attend school, but those who have a temperature or are feeling unwell should stay at home until they feel better. The requirement to self-isolate for five full days (which was previously 10 days) has been replaced with advice to avoid others “until you no longer have a high temperature (if you had one) or until you no longer feel unwell”. Hunter says this is broadly sensible since people tend to be at their most infectious in the early stage of infection and while symptomatic. “I’d isolate as long as I was quite ill,” he said. “If I wasn’t that ill, I’d expect three to five days or until I was well on the way to getting over it before I’d go back into society.” However, the advice becomes a bit stricter for those who actually confirm infection with a test. In this case the guidance is to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days after the day you took your test, or three days for children. “It’s worth remembering that we’re only picking up about one in eight infections through testing,” Hunter adds. “Whatever I do, there are seven other people wandering around with no clue that they’ve got Covid so even isolating everybody who knows they are positive isn’t going to make a massive difference.” Those who want to really minimise their risk of infecting others could stick with the previous guidance of ending isolation on the back of two consecutive negative tests starting from day five and six. After day 10, it is possible that lateral flow tests will continue to show a positive result, but the chances of still being infectious are extremely low.",News/World news,When should I do a Covid test in the UK and do I still have to isolate if positive?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/05/when-should-i-do-a-covid-test-do-i-still-have-to-isolate-england

4/5/2022,"Good morning. Worse atrocities than those discovered in Bucha are likely to be uncovered in other areas seized from Russian invaders, Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned, ahead of his appearance at the UN security council today. As he built support for an open investigation into the killings in Bucha, the Ukrainian president said: “And this is only one town. One of many Ukrainian communities which the Russian forces managed to capture. Now, there is information that in Borodyanka and some other liberated Ukrainian towns, the number of casualties of the occupiers may be even much higher.” The town of Borodyanka lies 25km (16 miles) west of Bucha. The president accused Russia of trying to “distort the facts” about the alleged atrocities and claimed it was “already launching a false campaign to conceal their guilt in the mass killings of civilians in Mariupol”. “They will do dozens of stage interviews, re-edited recordings, and will kill people specifically to make it look like they were killed by someone else,” he said. Is Zelenskiy going to meet Vladimir Putin? Zelenskiy spoke on Ukrainian TV in an address to the people. He cast doubt on whether there would be a meeting between him and the Russian president. How could Putin be prosecuted for war crimes? Biden has called for the Russian leader to face trial, but the process would be difficult and could play out in several ways. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 41 of the Russian invasion. The world can still hope to stave off the worst ravages of climate breakdown but only through a “now or never” dash to a low-carbon economy and society, scientists have said in what is in effect a final warning for governments on the climate. Greenhouse gas emissions must peak by 2025, and can be nearly halved this decade, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to give the world a chance of limiting future heating to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The final cost of doing so will be minimal, amounting to just a few percent of global GDP by mid-century, though it will require a massive effort by governments, businesses and individuals. But the chances were narrow and the world was failing to make the changes needed, the body of the world’s leading climate scientists warned. Temperatures will soar to more than 3C, with catastrophic consequences, unless policies and actions are urgently strengthened. What did Jim Skea, a professor at Imperial College London and co-chair of the working group behind the report, say? “It’s now or never, if we want to limit global warming to 1.5C. Without immediate and deep emissions reductions across all sectors, it will be impossible.” Police in the California state capital have made an arrest in connection with Sunday’s mass shooting that left six people dead and at least a dozen others injured. In the hours after the bloodshed, police say they have received more than 100 videos or photos from the scene and executed search warrants on three homes. They identified a 26-year-old man as one of the individuals arrested in connection to the shooting, in a press release. He has been charged with assault and illegal firearm possession offenses. Yesterday, authorities identified the six people killed in the shooting, after at least two shooters opened fire in a crowd as bar patrons filled the streets at closing time on the outskirts of the city’s entertainment district. The sound of rapid-fire gunshots at about 2am sent people running in terror. Twelve people were wounded in the neighborhood anchored by the Golden One Arena, which hosts concerts and the Sacramento Kings. Who were the victims? The Sacramento county coroner identified the six people who were killed as Johntaya Alexander, 21; Melinda Davis, 57; and Yamile Martinez-Andrade, 21, Sergio Harris, 38; Joshua Hoye-Lucchesi, 32; and DeVazia Turner, 29. Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney on Monday brought to three the number of Republican senators to say they would vote in favor of supporting Ketanji Brown Jackson as Joe Biden’s nominee to the US supreme court. Romney, the Utah senator, praised Jackson as a well-qualified jurist and “a person of honor”. The mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, has launched a digital campaign designed to persuade members of Florida’s LGBTQ+ community to move to the Big Apple, after their state passed a so-called “don’t say gay” law. Adams, a Democrat said: “Come to a city where you can say and be whoever you want.” Scientists have observed an enormous planet about nine times the mass of Jupiter at a remarkably early stage of formation – describing it as still in the womb – in a discovery that challenges the current understanding of planetary formation. Vladimir Putin has congratulated Hungary’s strongman leader, Viktor Orbán, on his decisive election victory, amid signs that European Union authorities will launch a sanctions process against Budapest that is intended to safeguard EU funds at risk from democratic-backsliding member states. The US Secret Service is paying more than $30,000 a month to rent a Malibu mansion in order to protect Hunter Biden. To house agents protecting Joe Biden’s son, the agency has rented a Spanish-style estate that according to a property listing boasts “resort-style living at its finest”. The mansion is close to Hunter Biden’s own rented mansion, for which he is reportedly paying about $20,000 a month. The Secret Service chose its property so it could be as close as possible to Biden, according to sources familiar with the matter who spoke to ABC News. Gap’s clothes defined an era. When it first hit the scene in the late 60s, Gap was speaking to a generation of young people. Today, the brand faces the challenge of clarifying a message that has grown blurry and the business has been steadily declining for years. Can a collaboration with Kanye West revive its fortunes – or is it just another sign of a brand flailing around for an identity? Every year, millions of kids are dropped off by their parents in the woods for weeks at a time, at institutions that have appropriated Indigenous names – or their made-up equivalents – and co-opted “native” practices into camp culture, such as powwows, totem poles, war paint, certain camp songs and “tribes”. Across the continent, the camping community is at last grappling with Native American cultural appropriation. Many camps have begun the long work of reparations, starting – though not ending – with renaming, writes Elena Sheppard. Thirty months: that is the very short time the world now has for global greenhouse gas emissions to finally start to fall. If not, we will miss the chance to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis, writes Damian Carrington in his analysis of the IPCC report. The conclusion of the world’s scientists, collated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and approved by all the world’s governments, says this reversal requires “immediate and deep” cuts in emissions everywhere. Two Charles Darwin manuscripts that were reported as stolen from Cambridge University library have been anonymously returned in a pink gift bag, with a typed note on an envelope wishing a happy Easter to the librarian. The precious items were found to be missing in 2001, but were not reported stolen until October 2020 after extensive searches. Dr Jessica Gardner, the director of library services, described her joy at their return as “immense”. As to who took them and who brought them back, she said: “It really is a mystery.
