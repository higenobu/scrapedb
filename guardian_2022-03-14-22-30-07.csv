3/14/2022,"Fifa is reviewing its relationship with the global sports concussion organisation it helps fund amid allegations of plagiarism against its former co-chair, the influential neuroscientist Dr Paul McCrory. A week after McCrory tendered his resignation from the Concussion in Sport Group, football’s world governing body has joined World Rugby in putting distance between itself and the protocols the Australian academic has helped shape in a multitude of sports including the NFL, the Football Association and the AFL. “It is with great concern that FIFA has taken note of the resignation of Professor McCrory from the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG),” Fifa said in a statement issued to the Guardian. “Given the seriousness of the situation, FIFA is currently analysing the work of the Concussion in Sport Group (CISG) as a whole in order to decide the best way forward. “Generally speaking, FIFA is fully supportive of the tools and information that has come from the consensus statements made by the CISG and it will continue to ensure these tools are freely available to all who wish to use them.” McCrory, a divisive figure who has previously described concussion among NFL players as “overblown”, was the lead author on four of the last five Consensus Statements on Concussion in Sport, from which Fifa and myriad other organisations draw their concussion guidelines and assessment protocols. That includes the standardised SCAT5 tool used by doctors to evaluate head injuries in athletes aged 13 and over. But the CISG was embroiled in controversy this month after the British Journal of Sports Medicine retracted a 2005 editorial written by McCrory, the publication’s then editor, citing an “unlawful and indefensible breach of copyright” of the work of Professor Steve Haake. McCrory said the “error” occurred because an unfinished and unreferenced draft had been accidentally uploaded. Since then, an analysis of 10 pieces suggests he may have copied other work without proper attribution. It leaves the CISG on shaky ground with its benefactors, which include Fifa, World Rugby and the International Olympic Committee, along with the International Federation for Equestrian Sports, the FIA and the International Ice Hockey Federation. Even before the McCrory allegations it faced criticism about alleged conflicts of interest, while its latest consensus statement, of which McCrory was the lead author, does not acknowledge “a cause-and-effect relationship” between chronic traumatic encephalopathy and repeated concussion or sub-concussive impacts. Last year a group of academics, researchers, clinicians and carers argued the process has consistently underplayed the risks. Since the plagiarism allegations surfaced, World Rugby has also distanced itself from McCrory, emphasising its independence and “individualised” case-by-case approach to return-to-play time frames. On Monday it “noted with concern” McCrory’s resignation. “World Rugby can confirm that Professor McCrory has not been involved in any concussion projects or research undertaken by World Rugby and he has not been involved in any concussion working group that shapes policy for the sport in this important area,” it said in a statement. “Rugby’s graduated return to play protocols (GRTP) are backed by scientific research and are guided by our Independent Concussion Working Group. Our GRTP is not based on the opinions of any one group or individual. “Given the seriousness of the allegations, World Rugby, guided by its Independent Concussion Working Group, is working with fellow founding sponsoring sports to investigate and identify any necessary governance measures required to better support the future of the Concussion in Sports Conference.” It is understood World Rugby may yet seek a more active role in CISG’s operations in exchange for its continuing support. Fifa, for its part, has recently taken some long-overdue steps in an attempt to mitigate the risk of head injuries in football. New protocols authorised by the Ifab at the end of 2020 allow for one or two permanent replacements to be brought into a match, over and above regular substitutes, if doctors believe a player could have concussion. It trialled a one-substitute protocol at the Club World Cup in Qatar while the Premier League, FA Cup and Women’s Super League have implemented a two-substitute policy, but so far many of Fifa’s 211 member associations have opted against it. At this year’s World Cup, concussion spotters will be introduced to identify from the stands possible brain injuries.",Sport/Sport,Fifa latest governing body to review links with Concussion in Sport Group,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/14/fifa-latest-governing-body-to-review-links-with-concussion-in-sport-group
3/14/2022,"Under a new scheme, British people will be encouraged to host those fleeing the war in Ukraine. A poll for the Observer suggested that almost one in three Britons might be willing to invite a refugee to live with them: 9% said they definitely would, while 20% said they might. If you are in that 20%, perhaps you have some questions about what it would be like to open your home to a stranger. Let me help. In the autumn of 2015, I invited a Syrian refugee to stay with me in Old Trafford. I was single at the time and living alone in a terrace house; everyone else my age (34) seemed to be getting married and having babies while I resolutely failed to find love. I figured I may as well make my life as interesting as possible while my friends talked to each other about primary school places and house prices. Also, obviously, I felt guilty and wanted to help. I had spent the summer transfixed by Europe’s worsening refugee crisis, which reached its nadir with the death of three-year-old Alan Kurdi, the Syrian toddler who washed up on a beach in Bodrum. I was feeling particularly guilty because my friend Elizabeth and I had just gone on holiday to Greece, and had deliberately avoided the islands where we might be confronted with desperate Syrians tumbling out of inflatable boats on to the beaches while we were working on our tans. I also felt sorry for Yasser, the 34-year-old Arabic teacher who ended up moving into my spare room. I had met him a few times in Manchester after I was introduced to him via a mutual friend in Turkey. I knew about the perilous 37-day journey he had taken to reach our rainy island by inflatable boat, train, foot and lorry. I had been to visit him in the grotty house off Manchester’s Curry Mile where the Home Office had dumped him while he waited for his asylum claim to be processed. I knew he would probably end up in a homeless hostel once he was “legit” and given refugee status, so offered my spare room “if you get stuck”. He ended up staying for six months – quite a bit longer than I had originally envisaged, but how can you evict a refugee? That is something I would urge anyone thinking of hosting to consider. The government is apparently going to ask you to commit to six months but what about after that? It is quite a tall order for a new arrival to save enough money for a rental deposit in six months, and the competition for social housing is fierce. Do set some ground rules, but bear in mind your guests will probably go out of their way not to inconvenience you. My dad told me to put a bolt on my bedroom door but I ignored him. I just gave Yasser a few dos and don’ts, like putting the deadlock on only if he was certain I was already home, and eating as much of my food as he liked as long as he didn’t finish anything off without checking. I also made a throwaway remark about how I often had to leave early and so needed the bathroom first. It later emerged he had taken the instruction to heart, and would lie in bed each day waiting for me to get up before he even went to the loo – a problem for his bladder given my unpredictable schedule, which often resulted in me not leaving the house until gone 9am and reading the paper in bed until the Today programme finished. Understand that you are not just offering your spare room but also your time. Chances are your guest(s) will need a lot of help integrating into society and navigating our bureaucracy, even if their English is good. I accompanied Yasser to the job centre when he was at risk of being sanctioned for not applying for enough jobs, and would regularly ring the bank and the doctors for him. Do not underestimate the trauma of war. Yasser, understandably, was obsessed with what was going on back in Syria, and would try to show me harrowing videos he had received via Facebook or WhatsApp. Eventually, I had to implement a “no war at the dinner table” rule. I would steer him away from the news when we watched TV, introducing him to the trash telly I watched in secret. Some shows were recognisable to him: they have the Voice in the Middle East too, for example. But Take Me Out, the dating show we both enjoyed at the time, did not translate. I gave up trying to explain Paddy McGuinness’s catchphrases (“let the squirrel see the nuts” etc), though Yasser did incorporate “no likey, no lighty” into his vocabulary, along with “love” and “hiya” and other northernisms. He became invested in my love life and would say that one day soon I would meet a nice man, “inshallah”. Yasser left when his wife and daughter got visas to join him, and a rather grand petroleum engineer from Damascas moved into his room. I met my now husband two months later. Yasser and his family came to the wedding. They live a few miles away from me in Manchester and have had two more daughters, proper little Mancunians. Yasser works as a teacher and the family are thriving. I can only take the tiniest bit of credit for their happy ending, but it sure feels good to help.

3/14/2022,"An NHS trust has ended the use of a monitoring system that continuously records video of mental health patients in their bedrooms amid concerns it allows trauma to resurface in sexually abused women. Camden and Islington NHS foundation trust (C&I) discontinued use of the Oxevision system after female patients and staff warned that it undermined the care of victims of sexual abuse and assault. Campaigners against violence against women called on the other 22 NHS trusts using Oxevision in some psychiatric wards to stop using it – or review its purpose in monitoring patients’ vital signs. C&I used the system in the Rosewood unit, based at St Pancras hospital, which is dedicated to treating the trust’s most vulnerable female psychiatric patients, who include survivors of sexual assault and childhood abuse. The trust suspended its use of Oxevision, which allows staff to monitor a patient’s pulse and breathing rate via an optical sensor, in November after patients complained they were being covertly surveilled. As part of an internal review into whether to resume using the system, C&I’s women’s strategy group contended that it compromised the trust’s commitment to providing trauma-informed care. The group, which includes staff and patients, said: “Women in inpatient mental health services are disproportionately affected by adverse childhood events including sexual abuse and adult experiences of sexual assault and domestic abuse. “The concerns about Oxevision relating to privacy and dignity and restrictive practice link to these experiences.” Lily, who previously told the Guardian how she became acutely distressed after discovering she was being recorded by Oxevision on the Rosewood unit, welcomed the trust’s decision. She said: “The intrusiveness of the system felt abusive, it was demeaning and left me feeling less than human. “There is no place in a trauma-informed environment for a system such as this – a system which films a patient’s bed throughout the day and night without their knowledge.” The End Violence Against Women Coalition and Rape Crisis both called on the NHS to review the use of Oxevision. Andrea Simon, director of EVAW, said: “Twenty-four hour surveillance of survivors is hugely and unnecessarily intrusive and it’s no surprise that survivors are saying this is retraumatising. It’s an unthinkable response to those who have experienced a violation of their individual autonomy and control. The support that rape and sexual assault survivors receive must work to counter this power dynamic, not reinforce it.” Dr Angela Sweeney, an expert in trauma-informed care at King’s College London, urged the NHS to “immediately suspend the use of Oxevision across all mental health trusts.” She added: “We know that people who have experienced sexual abuse, assault and coercive control may also have been subjected to the use of cameras, photographic equipment and other recording devices. To replicate this on mental health wards contravenes everything we know about creating safety. Rather than keeping people safe, the use of Oxevision is likely to create fear.” Jayne Butler, chief executive of Rape Crisis, added: “We would encourage the NHS and individual trusts to consider how to improve their practice and learn from the decision made at Camden and Islington NHS foundation trust, this should certainly include reviewing [the] decision to pilot this scheme.” A C&I spokesperson said: “The trust has discontinued the Oxevision pilot following concerns from some service users. While Oxehealth offered to make modifications to the system, we took the decision to end the trial because we felt some service users would still feel uncomfortable.” A spokesperson for Oxehealth, which created Oxevision, said it was constantly looking at ways to improve the service. He added: “Patients being cared for by staff with Oxevision report an improved sense of safety, less disturbed sleep and an increased sense of privacy.”",News/Society,NHS trust to stop filming mental health patients in their bedrooms,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/14/nhs-trust-to-stop-filming-mental-health-patients-in-their-bedrooms
3/14/2022,"Police in Washington DC and New York said they were searching for a man believed to have attacked people sleeping on the streets in both cities, killing two and injuring three. District of Columbia police said on Sunday investigators are working with the New York police department to find the man who left a victim in a burning tent after fatally shooting and stabbing him on Wednesday, then killed another man on Saturday in New York. The suspect shot and injured two other people earlier in the month in Washington and one other person on Saturday in New York, police said. “We are committed to sharing every investigative path, clue and piece of evidence with our law enforcement partners to bring this investigation to a swift conclusion and the individual behind these vicious crimes to justice,” said the Metropolitan police chief, Robert Contee, in a news release. Police determined the same person committed the attacks based on similarities in each shooting and evidence recovered. The victims were attacked without provocation, police said. “Given the similarity in the modus operandi of the perpetrator, common circumstances involved in each shooting, circumstances of the victims and recovered evidence, the NYPD, MPDC and the ATF [federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] will jointly investigate these offenses,” a joint statement said. The New York police commissioner, Keechant Sewell, said the “homeless population is one of our most vulnerable and an individual preying on them as they sleep is an exceptionally heinous crime”. The New York mayor, Eric Adams, said a task force composed of police officers and a homeless outreach team would focus on finding unhoused people in subways and other locations and urge them to seek refuge at city shelters. In a joint statement, Adams and the DC mayor, Muriel Bowser, said: “The rise in gun violence has shaken all of us and it is particularly horrible to know that someone is out there deliberately doing harm to an already vulnerable population. “We are also calling on unsheltered residents to seek shelter.” At a news conference, Adams said: “The case is a clear and horrific intentional act of taking the life of someone, it appears, because he was homeless. Two individuals were shot while sleeping on the streets, not committing a crime but sleeping on the streets.” Authorities are offering $55,000 for information resulting in an arrest, with the MPD offering up to $25,000, NYPD $10,000 and the ATF Washington Field division $20,000. The attacks are reminiscent of the beating deaths of four homeless men as they slept on the streets in Chinatown in New York in the fall of 2019. Another homeless man, Randy Santos, has pleaded not guilty to murder charges.

3/14/2022,"The total prize money pot for the Women’s FA Cup will benefit from a huge increase to £3m with a “disproportionate” amount going into the early rounds of the competition, the Football Association announced on Monday. As reported in the Guardian on Friday, the competition will see a close to tenfold rise on the £428,915 fund available to the 417 teams competing this season. “One commitment that The FA will be making, is that a disproportionate amount of this new fund will be invested into the early rounds of the competition,” the FA said. “This will ensure those clubs further down the pyramid entering those rounds, really feel the benefit of the prize money earned.” The FA Board signed off on the increase last Thursday and it will now begin discussions on how the money is divided and allocated. The Guardian understands that this is new money for competitions and is not being taken from the men’s prize fund or another area of women’s football. The FA’s director of women’s football, Baroness Sue Campbell, described achieving the landmark investment as one of her “most pleasing days” working in women’s football. “I’m delighted to be able to make this announcement of increased funding for the Vitality Women’s FA Cup because it’s going to benefit so many clubs across the women’s football pyramid,” she said. “Women’s football continues to be in a growth phase, and we are always looking to make improvements and investment to drive it forward and break new boundaries. This is certainly one of the most pleasing days during my time with the organisation, because I know it means so much to so many.” This season many teams lower down the pyramid have highlighted the difficulty of competing in the competition with prize money not covering costs. Clapton Community FC were forced to launch a crowdfunding campaign to cover the team’s away trips on a run to the third round. Sussex club Lewes FC consistently campaigned for an increase in the prize pot for the women’s game, first writing to the FA in February 2019 demanding action. Last season, champions Chelsea collected £25,000 for their win over Arsenal in December’s delayed final, 1.4% of the £1.8m handed to the men’s champions, Leicester City.

3/14/2022,"Doubts about the electability of Black candidates “should have no place in America in 2022”, a contender for the Democratic nomination for governor in Maryland said, after an email from a party official and donor expressing such doubt went public. The email from Barbara Goldberg Goldman, deputy treasurer of the state Democratic party, was obtained by Axios. The news site noted the disparity between such doubts and Democratic reliance on Black voters in states across the US, not least in the election of Joe Biden as president. In the email, which Axios said was written “to other party insiders”, Goldberg Goldman explained why she was backing Tom Perez, a former labor secretary and chairman of the Democratic National Committee, for the nomination for governor this year. “So, my thinking beyond here is the age-old question,” Goldberg Goldman wrote. “Which candidate(s) have a better chance in the general election of beating an attractive female [Larry] Hogan team member for whom both [Democrats] and [Republicans] have expressed genuine likability?” The possible Republican nominee referred to as a successor to Hogan, who has served two terms, is Kelly Schulz, currently state secretary for commerce. “Consider this,” Goldberg Goldman wrote. “Three African American males have run statewide for governor and have lost. Maryland is not a blue state. It’s a purple one. This is a fact we must not ignore. In the last 20 years, only eight have been with a Democratic governor. We need a winning team. IMHO.” A spokesperson for Wes Moore, an author and non-profit chief executive who is one of three Black candidates for the nomination, said: “The idea that there would be skepticism about a candidate’s electability because they are Black should have no place in the Democratic party in Maryland – a state with both incredible diversity and disparities – or anywhere else in America in 2022.” John King, US education secretary under Barack Obama, is also running. He told Axios he had heard similar sentiments to those expressed by Goldberg Goldman. “In Maryland,” he said, “we have a very diverse state and a diverse electorate, so we are well-positioned to have our first African American governor. Having served in the administration of our first Black president, one would have hoped we’d be further along in these conversations.” The other Black candidate for the nomination, former county executive Rushern Baker, said: “While I don’t agree, it’s a fair criticism, understanding we haven’t seen it happen yet … Although those candidates didn’t win, it’s not impossible. They just weren’t the right candidates at the right time.” A Perez spokesperson said: “These hurtful and ill-conceived comments do not reflect the values of our campaign – as evidenced by Tom’s entire career to advance civil rights and expand opportunity.” Axios said: “Past performance is a valid index to use when considering future successes. The invocation of race as a determining factor, though, takes the discussion beyond pure politics.” Goldberg Goldman said: “I regret making the statement. It neither accurately expresses nor depicts my views, and does not represent my lifelong commitment to supporting Democratic causes and candidates.”",News/US news,Maryland Democrat’s leaked email casts doubt over Black candidates’ electability,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/14/maryland-democrats-leaked-email-black-candidates-likability
3/14/2022,"Ross Kemp has lived many lives in public. He has been a soap opera psychopath, a war zone travelogue presenter and, most recently, someone who uses social media to show the world how veiny and purple his head can get during international sporting events. But Kemp is a restless spirit, always in search of the next adrenaline-filled adventure. And that is why, from today, Kemp has found his fourth age. That’s right, Ross Kemp is now a daytime quizshow presenter. Wonderfully, the quizshow he hosts has the most aggressively Kempish title possible: Bridge of Lies. Isn’t that evocative? Doesn’t it sound tense and exciting? Doesn’t it sound like it could, feasibly, be the name of a high-stakes cold war-era repatriation operation? Obviously, it isn’t any of those things. In reality, you could best describe Bridge of Lies as a kind of true or false hopscotch. But Bridge of Lies, eh? Cor. Now, there is a chance that you will tune in, as I did, because you want to see the distance between the comfortable, chummy primary coloured tonality of the daytime quizshow genre and Ross Kemp, a man who most recently went viral for screaming naked in front of some sunflowers . If that’s the case, at first, you will not be disappointed. Within the first few minutes of the first episode, Kemp finds himself confronted by a gaggle of daytime quizshow contestants for what appears to be the first time in his life. They are four family members, who yelp and whoop with an undeniable zest for life. They go on double dates, based on letters of the alphabet. For H, they went horse riding. For P, they went to Paris. And their appearance on Bridge of Lies is their letter T. “FOR TELEVISION!” they boom as one, all megawatt smiles and jazz hands. In response, Ross Kemp quietly blinks and then mumbles, “Shall we get on with the game?” with a mixture of boredom and disdain. But then the oddest thing happens. Once the game itself gets going, and he’s freed from the tyranny of small talk, Kemp absolutely blossoms. It helps that Bridge of Lies is built on an orderly system of left-brain logic that he can fall back on at any time. It’s about finding a path across a floor that is covered in spots, with each spot containing an answer. Say, the category is “Disney films” – one spot might say “Bambi”, the other “Shrek”. Jump on the one that Disney made and you get to continue the path. Hop on Shrek, meanwhile, and your prize total plummets. There are other typical gameshow complications, of course. Someone backstage has a blue button they can press at any time, and some of the spots just exist to let the contestant have a breather. The rules have to be explained time and time again, in a way that would absolutely exhaust a lesser mortal. But Ross Kemp gets off on this stuff something rotten. At every opportunity, he will jump in with a floor-to-ceiling list of each possible element that the game has to offer. This is his thing. Ant and Dec thrive by vicariously living through the contestants, amplifying their moments of triumph and anguish for the crowd. Danny Dyer thrives by creating a sense of seat of his pants chaos. But Ross Kemp demands order. This is his house, these are the rules and you will obey them. Once he settles into that pocket, the man is untouchable. The game itself, once it’s being played, is irresistible. It’s designed so beautifully that, if a player does well, it looks like a delicate piece of art. And if a player does badly, at least in my experience, you’ll scream yourself hoarse berating their stupidity. This is sleek and gleaming and finely engineered programme-making. And it’s fun. I put off watching Bridge of Lies for almost a week because my expectations were so low. But then, as soon as the first episode finished, I started watching the second. This could very well be a huge hit for the BBC. It turns out that Ross Kemp can present a quizshow just as easily as he can look like a naked veiny idiot on Twitter. Is there nothing the man can not do?

3/14/2022,"David Hockney has never patented a colour, as far as I know. But there’s a Hockney blue and a Hockney red, in fact a whole palette of bright subtle hues that are totally his own. That has never been more lusciously apparent than in his scintillating takeover of the Fitzwilliam Museum, one of Britain’s best collections of Old Master paintings. Those oldies have met their match. Next to Domenico Veneziano’s 15th-century Annunciation hangs Hockney’s version of the Virgin Mary being hailed by an angel that’s an intense, almost psychedelic rave of colour, a rich pink against blue shadows on an emerald lawn, all set off by the yellow floor with radiating terracotta lines. Roll over, Quattrocento. Yet Hockney would never say anything like that. He competes with artists from 500 years ago in a friendly familiar way, as if he went to the Royal College of Art with Veneziano and Fra Angelico rather than Allen Jones and RB Kitaj. What was he thinking of, painting his own Renaissance Annunciation after Angelico, in 2017? Experimenting with the theory of perspective, which the show enhances with a computer analysis of how Veneziano cheats on the idea of a single vanishing point. So from imbibing Hockney’s hot colours, you are led to think about western art’s discovery of how to picture the world in realistic depth. Hockney is not convinced that was a good idea, though. Perspective, he believes, is a limited way of seeing. At the Heong Gallery in Downing College, where this show spills over, they are screening a film he made about his favourite Chinese scroll, which unrolls to show an epic view of the emperor on the Grand Canal and the world around him. How can art recapture that big, generous picture? Hockney has a pretty good go. Next to a great Dutch landscape by Hobbema, with its receding view of a road defined by tall trimmed trees, hangs Hockney’s deconstruction of it in what he calls “reversed perspective”, on six canvases that show the space growing away instead of shrinking. Those colours again: fiery farmhouses, emerald fields. It’s lovely and it makes you see art history more clearly. This exhibition is like one of Hockney’s finely illustrated, laconically provocative books. You don’t have to agree with his theories to find they open up the way you see art. A room is given over to his claim, in his book Secret Knowledge, that the uncannily precise early 19th-century portraits of Ingres were created using a camera lucida. We get to see real examples of this industrial revolution optical tech, along with drawings by Ingres – and Hockney’s own camera lucida portraits of Damien Hirst, Ian McKellen and Alan Bennett. The Hockneys are much, much more fun. They have a life that’s bold as brass. At times, it almost seems unfair. The brightness of Hockney’s colours can make the old masters look dull. Next to one of his Yorkshire landscapes, a Constable view of Hampstead Heath looks like a wet hanky. Again, that’s not the intention. And in a room of Dutch flower paintings, a perfect conversation between past and present is staged. Hockey’s iPad flower pictures are animated on a screen in the middle of the space, taking shape then vanishing as he starts the next. The vulnerability and changeability of Hockney’s blooms make you look closer at the Dutch paintings to see insects and snails crawling on the bright tulips. For all its workmanlike modesty and irreverence about the “secret knowledge” of artists, this exhibition leaves you in awe of Hockney. You start to wonder if he is, in truth, a living old master. For it’s not all witty takes on perspective and cameras. Hanging among the treasures of this museum, and clearly belonging in the loftiest company, is Hockney’s huge 1970 painting Le Parc des Sources, Vichy, lent by the Duke of Devonshire. Two men are sitting side by side with their backs to us. The long wavy locks spilling over their collars have a glam period look that’s very moving. They are in a manicured park looking down an avenue of trees that narrows towards a crack of sky. The trees are sheer walls of colour on this three-metre wide canvas. One side is tinted blue, the other more lime coloured, matching the men’s clothes. Under the trees grow great pools of shadow. These intense, seductive colours enfold and immerse you. I kept coming back to enjoy the sense of drowning in atmosphere. This is painting as art cinema. You could construct a whole series of alternative stories about the two men and their calm yet hypercharged contemplation of a cool deep vista. This might be a love tryst or a quiet conversation about a mutual friend. And what about the third chair, which stands empty beside them? A photograph in the catalogue shows Hockney himself as the occupant of that seat. The two friends, in the snapshot, are the fashion designer Ossie Clark and the sculptor Mo McDermott. But these facts don’t exhaust the painting’s mystery, or its romantic grandeur. Here is the bigger picture he loves. It’s as big as life. In the end, I don’t believe it’s all done with cameras. There is a mystery to all great artists. And David Hockney has always had that. At the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, from 15 March-29 August.

3/14/2022,"Apparently, we haven’t learned anything from horror movies. If we had, we would have remembered that the villain always returns the very second the world believes they are finally vanquished. So, it was on a random Sunday night in March – during the hours normally set aside in the US for college basketball discussion – that Tom Brady announced he is returning to the NFL. “These past two months I’ve realized my place is still on the field and not in the stands,” Brady wrote on his Twitter account. “That time will come. But it’s not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. They make it all possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. Unfinished business. LFG.” And just like that, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who were contemplating a rebuild just days ago, have learned that the most accomplished quarterback in history will remain on their roster. Given the relative softness of the NFC South, something which most likely influenced Brady’s reversal, Bucs fans should be eager to see Brady back. While the team still has holes to fill, Brady’s return is enough to establish the team as a genuine Super Bowl contender once again (at least according to oddsmakers). Outside of Tampa Bay, the reaction to Brady’s return – which was timed to occur just before the start of NFL free agency – has been mixed. It came, after all, a mere 40 days since his first announcement, which itself emerged after a long weekend full of non-denials. For all the excitement regarding Brady’s return, there is also a feeling of weariness, echoing that old line: “how can we miss you when you won’t go away?” After all, the NFL had just given him a retirement lovefest. Amusingly, Brady’s “final touchdown ball” sold for over a half-million on Saturday. Brady’s on-the-field timing remains impeccable, but off the field, it could use some work. He had barely left the stage before coming back for his encore and if he’s hoping for one of those retirement tours like MLB gave New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, he may be overestimating the sentimentality of opposing teams and fans alike. Again, we should have seen this coming and not just because Brady immediately began hinting that the door wasn’t entirely closed just days after he initially ‘retired’. This wasn’t going to be how his NFL career ended, if only because the 44-year-old always said that his goal was to play until he was at least 45, and he had shown few signs of diminishing last season, leading the league in touchdowns and passing yards. Let’s hope, for his sake and pride, Brady can maintain that form. An old adage is that you don’t retire from the game, the game itself decides. When given the chance, hyper-competitive superstar athletes stay in their sport for as long as their bodies can hold up and teams are willing to pay them. In the NBA, Michael Jordan retired as the Greatest Of All Time not once but twice, which ended up being exactly one time too many. His final two seasons with the Washington Wizards have since become shorthand for the period when an athlete refuses to accept their professional mortality. The NFL is full of athletes who have overstayed their welcome, which is understandable given how precious time in the league really is. For instance, football fans have collectively agreed to forget that Joe Montana’s last season was spent with the Kansas City Chiefs rather than the San Francisco 49ers. Even more depressing was the saga of “Football Hamlet” Brett Favre. Favre was a legend with the Green Bay Packers but his reputation never fully recovered from the the highly public indecisiveness he showed before returning with the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings, with mixed results. Brady has already ensured that his time with the Buccaneers won’t be seen as an embarrassment: he won the Super Bowl in his first year with Tampa Bay and then led them to a 13-4 record the next season, which ended in a close loss to a Rams team that went on to win the championship. Brady had given us the perfect sports ending, it seemed, but it wasn’t enough for him. Athletes don’t play for us, however, they play for themselves. Brady – probably correctly – believes he has more left in the tank and he’s not yet ready to give up the only professional career he’s ever known. The NFL record books show that there’s nothing left for Brady to prove by returning to the field, but maybe that doesn’t matter when the game has decided it’s not done with you.",Sport/Sport,Tom Brady’s NFL return is both understandable and potentially foolish,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/14/tom-bradys-nfl-return-is-both-understandable-and-potentially-foolish
3/14/2022,"This is a touching if a tad treacly portrait of Ady Barkan, an inspiring American activist who has the terminal neurodegenerative disease ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis AKA motor neurone disease). Filmed over several years and directed by Nicholas Bruckman, it starts with Barkan, originally a lawyer, already well into his career as a protester and campaigner, particularly on issues that affect people on low incomes. When first met he seems like a loving family man, devoted to his wife Rachael, an academic, and their adorable baby son Carl. But then he’s diagnosed with ALS, and naturally everything changes. The film includes a tearful, wrenching clip he shot himself in the middle of the night after he found out and couldn’t sleep for worry. His health seems to deteriorate quickly – though perhaps that’s partly an effect of the cinematic compression of time. Even so, as the indominable little Carl gets bigger and stronger and the Trump administration wreaks more and more havoc on the nation and the world, Barkan gradually loses the ability to walk, talk or even breathe by himself. Amazingly, that doesn’t stop him from campaigning; he shifts his focus on to the threats to public healthcare and provision for people with pre-existing conditions like himself. In a famous viral clip filmed by friend and fellow activist Elizabeth Jaff, he debates the issue with Republican senator Jeff Flake on a plane. Although he doesn’t manage to persuade Flake to change his vote, the encounter triggered Barkan’s Be a Hero campaign which seeks, in addition to advocating for various progressive issues, to influence potentially persuadable Republicans such as Susan Collins to vote against, say, Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the supreme court. The struggle ends up cornering Flake in another confrontation, this time involving Ana Maria Archila in an elevator, cheered on by Barkan. Smart, funny and endearingly sweary even when he loses the power to speak without computer assistance, Barkan is a charismatic character who’s easy to like, although one wonders how much the documentary crew resisted showing anything that might dent the halo the film sets round his head. At one point, Barkan talks about his own feelings of guilt for being out on the road so much and missing his children’s early years (Rachael has a second child in due course); maybe it wouldn’t have hurt to probe further what price people like Barkan pay for their own heroism.

3/14/2022,"When filming A Cook’s Tour of Spain in 2008, I fell in love with the food of the country’s north. The beans were a highlight, whether cooked simply as a side, in tapas, with seafood or enriched with chorizo. Companies such as Brindisa, Bold Bean Co and Hodmedod’s are among those flying the flag for beans; theirs are so soft and succulent as to convert any sceptic. Try them in this comfort blanket of a stew: smoky clams and silky beans with the crunch of olive-oil toast, a savoury lick of sherry and a burst of citrus. Yes, please. Prep 15 minCook 30 minServes 4 7 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil2 red onions, peeled and finely chopped2 fennel bulbs, trimmed and finely chopped3 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped2 tsp sweet paprika1 x big jar butter beans, or 2 x 400g tins (about 480g beans), drained and rinsed250ml dry sherry4 pieces day-old bread1kg clams, cleaned For the gremolata1 small garlic clove, peeled2 big handfuls parsley leavesZest of ½ lemon First, make the gremolata: chop the garlic, then add the parsley and chop it all together until the parsley is roughly shredded and the garlic in tiny pieces. Grate over the lemon zest, season lightly and put to one side. Now for the beans. Warm four tablespoons of the oil in a large, deep pan over a medium heat, add the onions and fennel, and cook for 10-15 minutes, until translucent and smelling sweet. Add the garlic and paprika, cook for another few minutes, then stir in the beans and half the sherry. Heat through, cover and keep over a low, gentle heat. While the onions cook, warm two tablespoons of oil in a large frying pan and fry the bread on both sides until golden. Keep warm while you cook the clams. Warm the remaining sherry in a small pan. Heat the last tablespoon of oil in a large pan on a high heat and, when it’s smoking hot, add the clams and cover the pan. Cook for a few minutes, then pour in the warm sherry. Keep cooking on high, shaking the pan a little, for a few more minutes, until the clams have opened (discard any that don’t). Spoon the clams into the beans, fine-strain their cooking liquid to get rid of any grit, then add that, too. Quickly bring the beans up to heat, then divide between four warmed bowls, sprinkle over the gremolata and serve immediately with the fried bread. These beans are also delicious without the clams: sprinkle them with garlicky, cheesy breadcrumbs, bake and serve with a side of greens.

3/14/2022,"Why did the Kremlin tell us to call this war a special operation? Because no one in Russia wanted war. Everyone was afraid of war. War is real people leaving their homes and returning in zinc coffins. It’s smoking ruins where flourishing cities once stood. It’s ever-present fear. It’s poverty, starvation, collective insanity. This war was not wanted by the ordinary people who are going to pay for it. Nor by the businesses that will collapse as a result, nor the so-called elites who will be cut off from the world and deprived of their usual feeding troughs. Since the war began, normal life ended for everyone in Russia, and life under martial law began. Vladimir Putin personally declared the war in Ukraine. For an hour, across every TV channel, he tried to explain why war was essential – because Ukraine is a non-state that in principle does not deserve to exist. The invasion was founded on Putin’s personal hatred. He wanted the glory that he hoped a war would crown him with. He was counting on a Blitzkrieg: on the day the war began, TV stations ecstatically promised Kyiv’s capture by noon. But Putin was not prepared to take responsibility for this alone. And so, before the invasion began, he assembled the Russian security council – everyone who might later be able to say “I didn’t know” – and presented them with the facts. He smeared everyone who might have attempted to separately broker agreements that would avoid this descent into war. It isn’t me, Putin told the world. It’s us – everyone who is truly at Russia’s helm. The west has no one to negotiate with here. So if a case is one day heard in The Hague about the war in Ukraine, its defendants will be an entire group. Each person in this group surely keeps this prospect in mind. They, too, were frightened by this responsibility. It’s all there in the February video of the security council session gathered at the Kremlin. Apparently, they hadn’t even been told in advance of Putin’s plans to invade Ukraine. And in order to alleviate their fear, Putin then decided to smear responsibility for the war across his entire regime. The state Duma deputies and Federation Council members were also called in and presented with the facts. And resting on the theatrical consensus of the security council, the deputies and senators had to publicly support Putin. Russian MPs have been drilled to vote unanimously for whatever atrocious bill Putin may send them for approval. Even so, they only gave their consent to use the Russian army in Donetsk and Luhansk. But our tanks did not go to Donetsk. They went to Kharkiv, Kyiv, and Kherson. A week later it became clear that instead of a Blitzkrieg against mythical Nazi battalions, the country was facing a major war against the entire Ukrainian army and the country’s people. The Russian armed forces, for some bizarre reason branded with the Roman letter Z, got stuck in the mud. Our death toll has climbed into the hundreds. Our artillery started firing blindly, destroying Ukrainian housing blocks. When Russian forces bombed a maternity and children’s hospital, it became clear that we might be talking about war crimes. Putin’s regime is now attempting to make its crimes into those of the entire Russian people. To make us complicit. To brand the forehead of every Russian with the letter Z. Putin needs to do this in order to shift responsibility away from his regime and towards ordinary people; to convince the west that Russia is not destroying peace in Europe simply because of the whims of a group of madmen, but because of the will of all of Russia. He needs to convince Russian people that this war is being waged in the name of their survival. The regime is staging propaganda events to drum up popular support. It has organised administrative auto races under the Z flag through 80 Russian regions. Terminally ill children from a Kazan hospice have been arranged in a Z pattern against white snow and photographed from above. New explanations have been offered for the bloodshed: Ukraine had chemical or bacteriological weapons; it wanted to build an atom bomb; it wanted to attack first. At any price, by whatever lie, Putin must prove this slaughter makes sense, that the people and not just the Kremlin needed this war. But Russians must remember that by supporting the Z we are supporting the bombing and shelling of peaceful Ukrainian cities. We are supporting the destruction of hundreds of schools and driving millions of people from their homes. We are supporting the sundering of fraternal ties between families and our two countries for ever. We are supporting Russia’s profound isolation, its inevitable weakening and its transformation into a colony for China’s raw materials. Those who believe this propaganda must remember that the rest of the world now sees Russians as invaders. Before too long, they will see us as war criminals. And this will become a part of our history for ever. We are all being smeared – smeared with the blood of peaceful Ukrainians and our conscripts, who were sent into hell “for training exercises”. This is not our war, and we must remember that. We must talk about that. We cannot let them speak for us.

3/14/2022,"The world is facing a potential food crisis, with soaring prices and millions in danger of severe hunger, as the war in Ukraine threatens supplies of key staple crops, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization has warned. Maximo Torero, the chief economist at the FAO, said food prices were already high before Russia invaded Ukraine, owing to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The additional strain of war could tip the global food system into disaster, he warned. “We were already having problems with food prices,” he told the Guardian in an interview. “What countries are doing now is exacerbating that, and the war is putting us in situation where we could easily fall into a food crisis.” Wheat prices hit record highs in recent days, though they have fallen back slightly. Overall, food prices have been rising since the second half of 2020, according to the FAO, and reached an all-time high in February, after wheat and barley prices rose by nearly a third and rapeseed and sunflower oil by more than 60% during 2021. The price of urea, a key nitrogen fertiliser, has more than tripled in the past year, on rising energy prices. At least 50 countries depend on Russia and Ukraine for 30% or more of their wheat supply, and many developing countries in northern Africa, Asia and the near east are among the most reliant. Poor countries are bearing the brunt of the price increases. Many of the poorest countries were already struggling financially, with some facing debt crises, amid the pandemic. “My greatest fear is that the conflict continues – then we will have a situation of significant levels of food price rises, in poor countries that were already in an extremely weak financial situation owing to Covid-19,” said Torero, one of the world’s foremost experts on food and hunger. “The number of chronically hungry people will grow significantly, if that is the case.” The Covid-19 pandemic has reduced developing countries’ capacity to cope. “Food systems were able to be more resilient in 2019, though they struggled at the beginning,” said Torero. “Stocks were very high at the beginning of Covid-19, there was the capacity then to respond to the shock. But having Covid-19 for two years has weakened the resilience of food systems.” The war in Ukraine presents multiple threats to food security that will be felt across the world, according to the FAO. Ukraine and Russia are major food exporters, so the war directly threatens supplies of staples such as wheat, maize and sunflower oil. Ukraine alone supplied 12% of global wheat before the war, and was the biggest producer of sunflower oil. About two-thirds of the country’s wheat exports had already been delivered before the invasion, but the rest is now blocked, and farmers may be unable to continue with spring planting, or take in grain harvests in the summer. But the crisis goes deeper: Ukraine and Russia are also major producers of fertiliser, prices for which had already leapt under high energy prices – and the war is sending energy prices higher still, with further impacts on agricultural production costs. There is also the threat of countries closing their markets in response. The worst food price spikes in recent memory struck in 2007-08 and resumed in 2010-12, caused by high energy prices followed by poor weather. Those sudden peaks contributed to riots and political upheavals, the shocks of which are still being felt. The agriculture ministers of the G7 group of richest countries met on Friday to coordinate a response, urging countries to keep markets open. Russia played a role in the crises more than a decade ago, with restrictions on exports, especially in 2010 when Vladimir Putin banned all grain exports after drought in key growing regions. If Putin were to restrict or redirect exports again – after his manipulation of energy exports in the run-up to the war – it would cause severe problems in global food markets. “Right now, we can’t say prices are higher than in 2007-08, but it can get worse. If the energy and fertiliser situation becomes more serious, that will be worse than in 2007-08. If you add to that the potential for export restrictions, it will get worse,” Torero said. “Of course Russia can do what they want with their production. If they restricted exports, then the situation would get worse. Prices would increase even more,” he added. “We urge all countries, not only Russia but all countries, not to put export restrictions in place.” Torero urged countries to keep food systems open and to share information on stocks, harvests and food availability, to try to even out supply issues. Countries that were in a position to produce more should do so, he said. “Right now, the short-term problem is availability. We need to find ways to fill the gap [in production caused by the war],” he said. “We think the gap can be closed somewhat, but not 100%. Countries should also try to diversify their suppliers.” Even if the conflict were to be resolved quickly, the impacts would be felt for some time, he said. The soaring price of fertiliser, for instance, will have a delayed impact, reducing yields for harvests still to come, as farmers start to use less of it now. “These are the problems we will see next year,” said Torero.",News/World news,"Ukraine invasion may lead to worldwide food crisis, warns UN",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/14/ukraine-invasion-worldwide-food-crisis-warns-un
3/14/2022,"All free Covid testing in special schools and children’s care homes in England is to come to an end this month as the government presses ahead with its plan to return to normal life despite rising cases of the virus. Last month the government dropped its recommendation that secondary school pupils in England should take Covid tests twice a week, but said special schools would still be given free tests. However, the Guardian understands that with no additional funding available to continue it, even that provision will now come to an end. One source suggested the reaction within the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) to the decision had been one of “shock and distaste”. The head of one group of special schools in the Midlands said Covid could spread rapidly within the setting, and without access to free testing families would be more cautious about sending their children to school. “It’s taken a long time for us to persuade some carers that school is safe for their child but without testing we won’t have that daily reassurance,” the executive head said. “We have struggled with staff shortages before this. Another outbreak would mean some students having to stay home if we can’t maintain our [staff to student] ratios. A month ago I would have thought: OK, fine, we can get along without tests. But the last two weeks mean that warning lights are flashing again.” Children’s care homes were previously issued with batches of free tests and were able to order more as needed, but this is not expected to continue. The announcement of the government’s “living with Covid” plan, which included lifting the obligation to self-isolate, was delayed last month as the Treasury and the Department of Health wrangled over financing. The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was reluctant to continue funding the costly testing system, though the health secretary, Sajid Javid, insisted it must be ready to ramp up again if needed. Free lateral flow tests will no longer be available from April, and most other free testing is coming to an end. Javid will have to fund any continued testing for NHS staff from within his department’s budget, with details yet to be announced. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has repeatedly said he wants to see the UK “demonstrate to the world how you transition from pandemic to endemic”. School attendance figures in recent weeks have reassured the department. However, there is concern among teaching unions and school leaders about the impact of scrapping all testing, particularly against the background of rising infections. The latest ONS infection survey suggested one in 25 people in England had Covid in the week to 5 March. Last week a group of education unions sent a private letter toZahawi urging him to make tests freely available for schools and colleges, to minimise disruption for staff and students taking A-level, BTec and GCSE exams this spring. Julie McCulloch, the director of policy at the Association of School College Leaders, said: “The coronavirus has far from disappeared and all schools and colleges, and particularly those with vulnerable students, will be acutely aware that it might not take much for infection rates to rise rapidly again. “If students and staff are not given continued access to free tests, should they develop potential Covid symptoms there is a strong risk that they could attend when they are infected and transmit it to others, or stay away from the classroom with symptoms which may not be the coronavirus at all.” The shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, said: “Nobody wants to see further disruption to education and the government must therefore continue to make PCR testing available to all students and education staff with potential Covid symptoms after the end of March. “Families want to be confident that after two years of chaos and disruption their children can fully participate in education and experiences without worrying about costs.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We are now moving to living with – and managing – the virus, while maintaining the population’s wall of protection and communicating safer behaviours that the public can follow to manage risk. Decisions on testing will be outlined in due course.” The offer of a Covid vaccination is due to be extended to the parents of children aged five to 11 this spring, though no date has yet been set for the programme to be rolled out.",News/Education,Free Covid testing in special schools in England to end this month,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/mar/14/free-covid-testing-england-special-schools-to-end

3/14/2022,"In Liverpool, Africa Oyé festival is beloved. “It’s been called Christmas for scousers,” says Sonia Bassey, the current chair of the charity behind the event. The biggest festival of African and African diaspora music in the country, attracting a crowd of 80,000 to Sefton Park in south Liverpool, this summer’s edition will mark its 30th anniversary – after two years of pandemic-enforced cancellations. “The response was off the scale,” Bassey says. Over the past three decades, Oyé has brought some of the world’s biggest African artists to Liverpool, and often on a shoestring budget: now-massive names such as Tinariwen and Songhoy Blues played some of their first British shows there. This year, chart-topping Ghanaian artist Fuse ODG will play alongside the likes of Oumou Sangaré. But just as important, especially in a city whose musical identity is synonymous with white rock groups, is its focus on showcasing local Black talent. “I’ve been going to Africa Oyé since I was a kid,” says the rapper MC Nelson, who is from nearby Aigburth. “Seeing all kinds of amazing Black artists on stage, just down the road from my house, had a profound effect on me growing up. When I started taking music seriously my aim was Oyé, not Glastonbury or Coachella. I saw it as a way to inspire the next generation of Black scouse musicians.” That sense of community spirit is as integral to Oyé as the performers. Entry is free and always has been. Bassey comes from a family of activists, who were “heavily involved” in the community response to the 1981 Toxteth riots, and “the way Black people are oppressed by the structures that constantly kept them marginalised”. She is proud that by removing financial barriers, Oyé boasts a genuinely diverse crowd. “The festival takes place on the edge of some of the most deprived wards in the city,” says Bassey. “Families can bring a picnic and enjoy themselves for the day without it costing anything more than the food. To take that away would fundamentally change who we are as an organisation.” A registered charity, they get by instead on grants, public donations, and revenue from food vendors. Today, more than anything, it feels like the world’s biggest family reunion: it’s a running joke in Liverpool that you’ll only see your loved ones at “weddings, funerals and Oyé”. “I feel like a nodding dog, saying hello to so many people,” says David McTague, Oyé’s marketing director who has been at the festival since 2002. “Bringing people together who are Black, white, old, young, rich, poor and everything in between creates a unique friendly atmosphere and ambience, something I’ve not witnessed anywhere else.” It also put a focus on accessibility long before many of its contemporaries – employing onstage sign language interpreters, for example, long before this was considered a mainstream proposition. Oyé has come a long way since 1992, when it began as a cluster of gigs in the city centre booked by Glaswegian pirate radio broadcaster Kenny Murray. Now a reclusive figure since stepping away from the festival in 2013, back then he was a firebrand: legend has it he chose Liverpool for the festival by closing his eyes and sticking a pin on a map at random. Paul Duhaney, who had until then been operating in the London rave scene, was placed with him in a training scheme in 1998. “Kenny and I were like Fawlty Towers. We were basically doing everything between us,” he recalls. “At the time people’s education on African music was pretty much just Neneh Cherry on Youssou N’Dour’s 7 Seconds and the Heinz Beans adverts, but Kenny had so much passion to get people to listen.” At the turn of the millennium Oyé was piggybacking as the musical programming of a hot air balloon festival in Birkenhead, but by 2002 “we’d got so big we’d effectively taken it over without getting any of the credit”, Duhaney says. They took over a space in Sefton Park, but by 2008 had outgrown that too, moving to a larger field. Growth has to be incremental. “We just don’t have the money to take risks,” says Duhaney. “Everything’s got to be done in the right way to make sure that we’re going to be here the following year.” It’s still expanding now – this year they’ll host a number of additional shows across Merseyside, and plans are in place for a film festival – but the more Oyé grows, the harder it is to maintain its ethos as a festival of the people. “We’ve been hit by growing infrastructure costs over the years, with no uplift in grants,” says Bassey. The enforced downtime of the pandemic was an opportunity to regroup and consider the festival’s future. It’s telling that Oyé emerged more ambitious than ever. As well as a strategy that should keep entry free for at least another half a decade, they now have their sights set on a long-term plan to establish a permanent Black music hub in Liverpool. Though she’s wary of being “too prescriptive” about which artists it would include at this point, the focus would be “local and regional talent” across jazz, soul, hip-hop, reggae and grime. “We all know about the Beatles,” Bassey says, “but our history of music isn’t as well told.” Africa Oyé is at Sefton Park, Liverpool on 18/19 June.",Arts/Music,"‘My aim was Oyé, not Glastonbury’: Liverpool’s beloved African music festival turns 30",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/mar/14/my-aim-was-oye-not-glastonbury-liverpool-african-music-festival-turns-30-africa-oye
