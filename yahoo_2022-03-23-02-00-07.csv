3/23/2022,"By Jan Wolfe WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A New Mexico county commissioner who founded a group called ""Cowboys for Trump"" was found guilty by a judge on Tuesday of breaching the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021 riot, a second consecutive win at trial for the Justice Department. Following a two-day, non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden in the District of Columbia said the defendant, Couy Griffin, was guilty of one of the two misdemeanor offenses he faced. The judge's ruling bolsters a key theory from prosecutors in hundreds of related cases. They argued that the Capitol grounds were strictly off-limits on Jan. 6, 2021, and that should have been apparent to the thousands of Donald Trump supporters who breached them that day in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Democratic President Joe Biden's election. The judge found Griffin guilty of entering a restricted area protected by the U.S. Secret Service, but cleared him of disorderly conduct. McFadden said Griffin should have known not to scale walls and enter the Capitol grounds, but said Griffin was innocent of disorderly conduct because he never tried to rile up the crowd at the Capitol or engage in violence. McFadden scheduled a June sentencing hearing for Griffin, who faces up to one year behind bars. Before the mob stormed the Capitol, Trump gave a fiery speech in which he falsely claimed his election defeat was the result of widespread fraud, an assertion rejected by multiple courts, state election officials and members of his own administration. About 800 people face criminal charges relating to the riot, which sent then-Vice President Mike Pence and members of Congress running for their lives. Some 200 have already pleaded guilty. Griffin's bench trial is seen as an important test case as the Justice Department attempts to secure convictions of the hundreds of defendants who have not taken plea deals. The first jury trial for a Jan. 6 defendant ended in a decisive victory for prosecutors earlier this month. After a quick deliberation, a jury unanimously found a Texas man guilty on all five of the felony charges he faced, including bringing a gun onto the Capitol grounds and obstructing an official proceeding.

3/23/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) - A Russian newspaper has accused hackers of planting fake news on its website after a report briefly appeared there saying nearly 10,000 Russian soldiers had been killed in Ukraine. The incident marked the second apparent breach within a week of the tightly controlled war narrative that the Kremlin promotes through loyal Russian media. An online article on the site of mass-market paper Komsomolskaya Pravda, still accessible via a web archive tool, quotes the Russian defence ministry as saying 9,861 Russian servicemen have been killed and 16,153 wounded in what Moscow calls its special military operation in Ukraine. Those figures had been removed from a version of the same article visible on the website on Tuesday. Instead, an advisory said: ""On March 21, access to the administrator interface was hacked on the Komsomolskaya Pravda website and a fake insert was made in this publication about the situation around the special operation in Ukraine. The inaccurate information was immediately removed."" Russia has not officially updated its casualty figures since stating on March 2 that 498 servicemen had been killed and 1,597 wounded. Since then its offensive has run into further heavy resistance from Ukraine's army and volunteer defence forces. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday that he could not comment on the incident with Komsomolskaya Pravda, saying it was a question for the newspaper. He said he had no information on casualty figures. Alexander Gamov, a Kremlin correspondent for the paper, said on the same call that its website had been hacked and fake information had appeared there for several minutes. Earlier, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak drew attention to the two online versions of the newspaper article and the alleged figure of 9,861 Russian deaths. ""This is only the beginning of the realisation of their national catastrophe. Because in the real world there are almost twice as many as Russians killed,"" Podolyak wrote on Telegram. It was not possible to independently verify any of the purported casualty claims. Komsomsolskya Pravda is among Russian media which have loyally followed President Vladimir Putin's line that Moscow is pursuing a special operation in Ukraine to demilitarise and ""denazify"" the country - an argument rejected by Ukraine and the West as a false pretext to invade a democratic country. Last week, an editor at Channel One state TV news appeared live in the studio for several seconds shouting anti-war slogans and holding a ""NO WAR"" poster during an evening news show. The woman, Marina Ovsyannikova, was fined 30,000 roubles ($280) by a court, after the Kremlin denounced her protest as ""hooliganism"".

But that was not possible for the couple after his residential complex was suddenly locked down. ""He was supposed to pick me up at 6 a.m., but his compound was closed off, and he was stopped by the security guards at the compound gates,"" she said, adding that she decided to head over immediately even though she hadn't finished her wedding makeup look. When she arrived, the guards unlocked the gates and allowed her to go in as long as she promised not to leave the area. But the couple weren't allowed to get married quite yet.

3/23/2022,"Adult film actor Stormy Daniels said Monday she “will go to jail before I pay a penny” to Donald Trump after losing an appeal in her failed defamation lawsuit against the former president. Daniels made her defiant stand on Twitter after a federal appeals court upheld a lower court’s ruling that she pay Trump $300,000 for attorney’s fees, CNBC reported. Friday’s ruling capped a prolonged legal battle between Daniels, whose birth name is Stephanie Clifford, and Trump over her allegation that she had sex with him in 2006 and was bribed to stay quiet about it. Daniels sued for defamation after Trump called her claim that a man threatened her about the Trump tryst story a “con job.” A judge dismissed the defamation suit in 2018, saying Trump’s statements were protected by the First Amendment. Trump’s then-fixer, attorney Michael Cohen, admitted making hush money payments to Daniels and another woman on Trump’s behalf before the 2016 election to keep them from telling their stories. Cohen served prison time on charges that include campaign finance violations involving the payments. Meanwhile, Daniels’ attorney Michael Avenatti was convicted last month of cheating Daniels out of hundreds of thousands of dollars in a deal for a book detailing her alleged tryst with Trump. Trump, who denied having sex with Daniels, gloated after the appeals decision sided with him, calling it a “total and complete victory and vindication for, and of me.” “The lawsuit was a purely political stunt that never should have started, or allowed to happen, and I am pleased that my lawyers were able to bring it to a successful conclusion after the court fully rejected her appeal,” Trump said in a statement. “Now all I have to do is wait for all of the money she owes me.” This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.
