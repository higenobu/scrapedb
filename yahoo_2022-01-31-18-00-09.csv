1/31/2022,"Conroe, Texas — The Donald Trump train made its second stop here this Saturday with a coterie of politicians, conspiracy theorists, and grifters in tow. It came on the heels of a Lara Trump rally in north Texas this past Thursday and just two weeks after a similar rally in Phoenix, Arizona. Meanwhile, six hours south at the border, the disgraced QAnon peddling general Michael Flynn and other far-right figures held an event at the exact same time followed up by a caravan to the border on Sunday. Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, who spoke at a QAnon conference in Dallas last July, was featured as a speaker at both events. This confluence of events in Texas demonstrates the sort of far-right politics that is coalescing here: paranoid, obsessed with or tolerant of bigoted conspiracy theories, eager to appeal to violence, and convinced they’re fighting against a secret Marxist plot. If this sounds familiar, it’s because similar politics emerged during the Weimar period in Germany, were honed by the Nazis, and later trafficked into mainstream politics via the John Birch Society — one of the sponsors of the event at the border. More from Rolling Stone Trump Dangles Pardons for Jan. 6 Rioters in Texas Rally Speech Dan Crenshaw's Voting-Rights Hypocrisy Is Breathtaking Lara Trump Talks Political 'War,' 'Good Versus Evil' in Extremist Heart of Texas Dozens of politicians from across the state and country turned out for the rally, seeking to ride on Trump’s political coattails. Governor Greg Abbott, Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, Attorney General Ken Paxton, and State Senator Dawn Buckingham all spoke glowingly of Trump and touted their endorsements from the former president. We were in one of the reddest counties in one of the reddest states, and it showed: When I arrived at the press check-in station, the first thing I saw was a merchandise vendor with a Confederate flag — the banner of a nation that lasted only 4 years before being routed out of existence — that says “Come And Take It.” It was set up directly across from a wooden cross. Having attended the prior rally in Arizona and the Lara Trump event on Thursday, a twisted sense of deja vu came over me when I got into the venue and began to hear the same songs, watch the same videos, listen to the same speeches, and see the same people. There were many familiar faces — election conspiracy peddling MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and the JFK Jr. obsessed QAnon cult leader Michael Protzman — and in some instances, near word for word repeats of previous events. Trump opened the Houston rally in the exact same manner as he did in Arizona: saying it’s the biggest rally ever, that the media is fake, and that they won’t turn their cameras around to show the crowd size. He even repeated the false claim about a 29 mile long line of cars, but this time it was 30 miles long. The crowd began to jeer at the press. When I turned around to take a photo of the overflow crowd, someone flipped me off. From inside the press pen I was able to observe Michael Protzman, aka Negative 48, and over one hundred of his followers secure prime seats directly to the left of the stage. The Protzmanians arrived over a day early and began lining up for the event the night before, just as they had in Arizona. The group was in rare form, dancing and singing together. They wore matching red ties and shirts depicting Donald Trump, JFK, and JFK Jr. Prior to the event, Protzman predicted to his group that who they would be seeing speak at the event was not actually Trump but JFK in disguise — a claim they’ve made before regarding the Rolling Stones concert in Dallas, Texas. When I approached Protzman and asked him what he expected to see, he responded cryptically. “You never know,” he said, before bopping off to tend to his flock and dance with one of his lieutenants, Stephen Tenner, who at one point shook hands with Mike Lindell. As of late the Protzmanians have taken to compiling a variety of non-standard calendars to ensure they have every combination of possible dates to check against their “decoding” of the numerology. This is because none of their dates or predictions have panned out. The entire scene — replete with more merch vendors than a Grateful Dead concert — made me think of the Church of Unlimited Devotion, the infamous subset of Deadheads who believed Jerry Garcia was the second coming of Jesus. One of the central claims of Protzman’s belief system sounds awfully similar: JFK is the second coming of Jesus Christ. They also traffick in fascist propaganda and Holocaust denial. The Protzmanians, like the Church of Unlimited Devotion, are a relatively small sect. Neither are fully representative of the larger movements from which they emerged, but they demonstrate what can happen when magical thinking and cults of personality collide and provide us an understanding of how far some folks have fallen off the map. Even if only a little over 100 out of the thousands of people at the Trump rally truly believe that JFK Jr. is secretly alive or somehow related to Christ, many attendees seem to be willing to believe other things that aren’t true, like that refugee immigration from crisis-stricken countries is a part of a sinister Marxist plot or that murders have gone up one thousand and nine hundred percent. This strain of political thought, particularly the notion of a secret Marxist plot, isn’t new in this country. The paranoid anti-communism of McCarthyism gave way to the John Birch Society, which has sought to mainstream its far-right ideology for decades. In Conroe, I witnessed the fruits of their labor. Hats and shirts for sale that simply say “God, Guns, and Trump” and speeches that I can only describe as full-blown Bircherism. Without a hint of irony, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller said the upcoming elections are a race between “Patriots and Traitors,” suggesting that the side that isn’t on trial for seditious conspiracy is the traitorous one. Lt. Governor Dan Patrick said the election was stolen and that Marxists want to “take away the country from us.” Gov. Abbott made an abstruse comparison between Biden’s response to the Russian army at the Ukraine border to the Texas-Mexico border, doubling down on the idea that immigration is a part of a planned invasion. The crowd chanted “build that wall,” which Biden has continued to do in some parts. When Trump finally took the stage after hours of patience, the temperature had dropped significantly. My toes were cold and my soles regretted the choice of cowboy boots. Trump repeated much of what he said in Arizona but mixed in some of his trademark stream of consciousness riffs to keep things fresh. Less than an hour into his speech, the crowd started to thin out. I’d heard it all before, so I decided to follow suit. (Indeed, it was more than an hour into his rambling speech when Trump offered something new: teasing a 2024 presidential run and dangling pardons for Jan. 6 rioters if he retakes office.) As I approached the main exit, Trump was talking about Hillary Clinton. “Lock her up!” the crowd chanted. A woman walking beside me said to no one in particular, “Clinton’s a witch, that’s why they’re never going to lock her up.” And as I approached the parking lot by the nearby baseball fields where I’d parked, I overheard a conversation between two older women. “How does Trump expect us to stand around for five hours?” one said to the other, referring to the ban on any form of lawn chair at the event. “By the time he started talking, we were hurting.” For the first time all day, I agreed with what I was hearing. Later that evening, I went back to a pizza place by my hotel about 40 minutes south of Conroe in an upscale suburb of Houston called The Woodlands. I got to chatting with my server, a young man with a ponytail and glasses. When I told him I’d been in Conroe, his eye twitched. He said he grew up in Conroe and that his eye had twitched for a reason. When I told him what I had seen there, he asked me if I wanted a free shot of whiskey. I wish I had asked for two.

1/31/2022,"A former Washington State Patrol trooper who told off Gov. Jay Inslee over the COVID-19 vaccine mandate, resigned and then became a sought-after media figure, has died, according to the State Patrol. Trooper Robert LaMay’s death was announced Friday. He was 50. According to FOX News, KIRO News Radio, Newsweek and other media sources, LaMay died after contracting COVID-19. His former boss, State Patrol Chief John Batiste, said he was deeply saddened to hear of LaMay’s death Friday. “Rob served honorably for over two decades and we were disappointed to see him leave the agency this past October,” Batiste said. “His service to this state and agency will be long remembered and appreciated.” LaMay took early retirement in October rather than get vaccinated. A video shows him giving his final radio call in which he tells Inslee to “kiss my a**.” The video went viral and LaMay soon was appearing on numerous news outlets. “This is the last time you’ll hear me in a patrol car and Jay Inslee can kiss my ass.”

Washington State Trooper in Yakima, Wash. signs off after 22 years — fired by @GovInslee for being unvaccinated. pic.twitter.com/RGLDs5BZxg — Jason Rantz on KTTH Radio (@jasonrantz) October 17, 2021 No statement from his family has been issued. Last summer, LaMay had said he and his family did not “do” vaccines and he never received any as an adult. In August, on his Facebook account, he said vaccines go against his religious beliefs. His account is no longer visible. While 73 other commissioned officers quit the State Patrol over the mandate, none received the media celebrity status LaMay did. On Jan. 12, Jerrod Sessler, a Prosser businessman running for Congress in Washington’s 4th district, announced that LaMay had endorsed him. “Mr. Lamay took the hearts of Americans by storm when he resigned from his position as a State Trooper because he refused to succumb to the mandates enforced upon him by a constitutionally over-extended Governor,” Sessler said. Sessler said he would appoint LaMay to head an anti-human trafficking task force he would commission. In the endorsement, LaMay accuses state politicians of ignoring human trafficking. He went on to say, “many of whom are involved in it themselves and do not want it to go away.” LaMay joined the State Patrol in 1999 as a trooper cadet. He was commissioned in 2001. The trooper served in Poulsbo, Bremerton, Ellensburg and, most recently, Yakima. He worked as an armorer, collision reconstructionist and as a drug recognition expert. LaMay’s is the not the first high profile death to affect the State Patrol. Trooper Eric Gunderson died Sept. 26 after contracting COVID while on business for the agency six weeks earlier. The trooper was 38 and unvaccinated but his family said he would have followed the mandate. “It is important for everyone to know, he was not a part of any anti-vaccine or political movement,” Gunderson’s family said in a statement.

1/31/2022,"Democratic Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), who sits on the House Select Committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, and former President Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election, appeared on CNN Newsroom With Pamela Brown Sunday, where she spoke about why the committee has yet to call the former president in for questioning. Asked if the committee will call Trump to testify, Lofgren responded, “We haven’t decided that yet. We have a lot of investigations underway, and that is a weighty decision that we have discussed but have not decided on.” Lofgren said that one reason the committee hasn’t called on Trump for an interview is because, in her mind, he can’t be trusted to tell the truth. A report from January of last year stated that Trump told roughly 30,000 “mistruths” during his four years in office. “The former president has a voracity problem that is well known,” Lofgren said. “You know, there used to be ‘How many falsehoods does he say in any one sentence?’ So I think there has to be a weighing of how valuable the evidence, or testimony, would actually be.” Lofgren also said that Trump’s litigious history has been a factor in the decision not to attempt to question him. “He is very litigious, and he would tie the committee up in court for as long as he possibly could,” Lofgren said, “and since there are various privileges that a former president can assert, even if they don't hold up in the end, that can take a very long time.” Lofgren went on to say that based on the testimony the committee has already received, along with the mountain of documents in its possession, including several hundred that Trump tried to stop the National Archives from sending, they may not need to speak with Trump. “The huge amount of documents that we are receiving from others in his inner circle, from the national archives,” Lofgren said, “is starting to paint a rather vivid picture, as far as I'm concerned, about what happened, and when that picture is put together, we will reveal it to the American public in a series of hearings.” CNN Newsroom airs weekdays at 9 a.m. and 2 p.m., and weekends at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. on CNN. Watch former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson call out the network for devolving into 'non-fact-based conspiracy theories': On CNN’s Democracy in Peril Thursday, former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson spoke about the current conditions at her former network. Carlson first touched on the power opinion host Tucker Carlson seemingly has over Republicans in Congress, saying it’s the result of fake news, then went on to lament the turn Fox News has taken.
“Slowly but surely, this has morphed into eradicating any other point of view since the Trump era that is not just opinion,” Carlson said. “It's gone from an opinion, which was fine, to completely devolving into non fact-based conspiracy theories and outright dangerous rhetoric in my mind, and I think it’s a complete disservice to our country.”
Carlson also addressed a story that got very little airtime, if any, on Fox News, that being that Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham each sent texts to the White House during the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol pleading for former President Trump to put a stop to the violence, then going on air and spinning a different narrative.
“I think the bigger story coming out of that is how disingenuous it was to be sending those texts of warning while then going on the air to the American people and doing a complete injustice and disservice by saying something completely opposite,” Carlson said, “and ginning up this whole reaction that it was just fine and patriotic for people to be there on January 6th.” Read more from Yahoo Entertainment: Von Miller's lucky 'Cardi B' guess on 'Wheel of Fortune' scores $10,000 for his charity 'Joe Millionaire' bachelor hits boiling point and asks to talk to producer: 'I just want to leave' 'Willful ignorance': Joe Rogan's comments on Blackness challenged by Vanderbilt professor Tell us what you think!

1/31/2022,"Alexandra Daddario, 35, just had a major abs moment on Instagram. The former Baywatch star took to the social media platform to post two smokin' snaps that featured her incredible washboard abs and super sculpted core. And damn, she's looking hella fit! So how does she stay as strong as she is? Well, Alexandra is a hot yoga devotee. And she makes sure to slay it at the gym too. Former Baywatch star Alexandra Daddario is known for bringing it in the fitness department (have you seen her YouTube workout videos? OMG). But she just casually dropped a few pics in her Instagram Stories that show she’s still going hard at the gym. The photos are totally casual—they feature Alexandra showing off her tight abs and toned booty from the side, followed by a shot of the actress in comfy-looking sweats, lifting up her shirt slightly so you can see her abs. But there’s nothing casual about the way the 35-year-old approaches her workouts. Alexandra previously told Health that when she trained for her role as a lifeguard in Baywatch, she “was doing more aerobic activity and way more weight training, which is something I’ve [since] incorporated into my daily routine.” But, she said, the level she was going at was “not sustainable” unless you’re being paid to do it. These days, she spends a lot of time doing hot yoga. ""They teach mindfulness while getting a great workout,"" she says of her go-to studio, Modo Yoga. But she makes sure to get in gym time, too. Alexandra shared an intense-looking workout on YouTube with her trainer Patrick Murphy, that focused on doing as many reps as possible (a.k.a an AMRAP workout). And yeah, this is no joke. Alexandra focused on exercises that worked her upper body, legs, glutes, and abs, including lateral raises, reverse lunges, jump squats, push-ups, and stability ball crunches. She did 1o reps of each and worked through the circuit until 20 minutes had passed—whew! Alexandra did another YouTube fitness video alongside her Baywatch co-star Zac Efron and even beat him in a sit-up competition. So, yeah, Alexandra comes to play. Of course, Alexandra eats well, too. She told Health that her favorite meal is a mix of quinoa, avocado, and chicken breast. “When I’m hungry, I want food, like, now, or else I get very cranky,” she said, noting that it’s really easy to throw this meal together. Other go-tos, she told Delish, including having Sriracha bowls or salmon with broccoli and quinoa. But Alexandra also makes room in her eating plan for less healthy options. “As long as you’ve taken care of yourself in other ways, I think that it’s important to have balance,” she said.
