3/23/2022,"By Alexander Tanas CHISINAU (Reuters) - Moldova is monitoring its breakaway pro-Russian region of Transdniestria for any sign of escalating tensions following Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, Foreign Minister Nicu Popescu said on Tuesday. Transdniestria is a narrow strip of land held by pro-Russian separatists that runs along the east of Moldova and comes to within about 25 miles (40 km) of the Ukrainian port of Odesa. Russian troops are stationed there, despite repeated calls by Moldovan President Maia Sandu for them to leave. Ukraine fears Transdniestria could be used as a new front, putting further pressure on Odesa. ""So far the situation is calm. We have not seen any movement towards escalation,"" said Popescu said at the European parliament. ""Given what happened in the region before, we as a government cannot rule out any options and must consider the full range of scenarios for the development of events including negative ones."" Russian peacekeepers appeared in Transdniestria after it fought a brief war with Moldova in 1992 and declared itself an independent state. It remains unrecognised by any country, including Russia. In early February, Russian forces held military drills in Transdniestria against the backdrop of a Russian troop buildup near eastern Ukraine that led to the Feb. 24 invasion. The war has pushed Moldova to speed up a bid to join the European Union and piled huge pressure on its economy by forcing more than 331,000 refugees across the border from Ukraine, of which around 100,000 have remained in the country. On Tuesday, gas importer Moldovagaz warned that the country also faced a potential energy price crunch that could see what it pays for gas from Russia rise to $1,000 per 1,000 cubic meters in April from the current level of $547 due to a sharp rise in gas prices in Europe. But the head of Moldovagaz Vadim Cheban told journalists the company:""will not rush to demand an increase in the gas tariff for consumers"".

3/23/2022,"Russia’s military has claimed to have twice unleashed hypersonic missiles in its invasion of Ukraine, apparently destroying an arms depot in the process, during its monthlong onslaught. On Saturday, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed it had struck an underground missile and ammunition warehouse in a village that borders Romania, and on Sunday, that it had destroyed a fuel depot near the southern city of Mykolaiv. Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov claimed the attack used its newest Kinzhal, or “dagger,” hypersonic missile, in Ukraine. “The Kinzhal aviation missile system with hypersonic aeroballistic missiles destroyed a large underground warehouse containing missiles and aviation ammunition in the village of Deliatyn in the Ivano-Frankivsk region,” Konashenkov claimed. RIA Novosti, a Russian state news agency, said the attacks were the first time the next-generation weapons have been used since Russian troops were deployed to Ukraine on Feb. 24. However, on March 9, Ukraine’s National Guard shared a picture of an unexploded hypersonic missile in the city of Kramatorsk in the breakaway region of Donetsk. Reports did not verify whether it was a “dagger” missile. The advanced missile, which Russian President Vladimir Putin previously described as an “ideal weapon,” was one of several new weapons he unveiled in his state of the nation address in 2018. During that speech, Putin boasted that the missiles could hit almost any point across the world and evade the United States’ missile defense shield. It is believed that Russia first used the hypersonic weapon in support of Bashar Assad during the Syrian civil war in 2016, although it has not been confirmed if it was the exact Kinzhal model. The missile, designed to be launched from a MiG fighter jet, can fly at 10 times the speed of sound, and unlike other missiles can change course during its flight, making it impossible for air-defense systems to shoot it down. The Kinzhal missile can also be used to deliver nuclear weapons. In comparison, while the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile can travel as fast as 550 mph, the Kinzhal can travel at 7,672 mph. The French Navy and the U.K.'s Royal Navy have since 2011 been jointly developing their own hypersonic missile, which is expected to be completed in 2030. Ukrainian officials have confirmed Russia’s attacks over the weekend but said the type of missile used was not confirmed. According to reports, doubts have swirled over Russia’s use of the ballistic missile. One report suggested that the lack of secondary explosions from the attack at an ammunition warehouse in western Ukraine is suspicious. “There’s also a distinct lack of secondary explosions as one would expect when rocket fuel and explosives cook-off,” the online magazine the War Zone noted on Saturday. The magazine also questioned how an Orlan-10 — an unmanned aerial vehicle, commonly known as a drone — was able to fly over the targeted area to film the strike. If a maneuverable hypersonic missile was needed for the attack due to Ukraine’s air-defense systems, then how could a drone manage to film the strike and get away safely? Russian analyst Pavel Felgenhauer said the missile would change little on the ground in Ukraine beyond “giving a certain psychological and propaganda effect.” He added that its use may suggest that the Russian military’s weapons are drying up. Defense strategy researcher Joseph Henrotin reiterated Felgenhauer’s point, suggesting on Twitter that Russia could be running out of weaponry. Henrotin also claimed that Putin might have used the nuclear-capable missile in a bid to raise the stakes of the war. On Saturday, the U.N.’s human rights office said at least 847 civilians had been killed since Feb. 24, including 155 men, 119 women, 21 boys and seven girls, but said it’s believed the actual figures are “considerably higher.” _____ _____",World/Yahoo News,What are hypersonic missiles?

3/23/2022,"The woman who shoved a beloved singing coach to her death earlier this month has been arrested, the New York Police Department announced Tuesday. Lauren Pazienza, 26, turned herself in at an NYPD precinct in the Chelsea neighborhood with her attorney Tuesday morning, according to the New York Post. She was charged with manslaughter after allegedly shoving Barbara Maier Gustern, 87, while running down a New York City street on March 10. Gustern fell, hit her head on the pavement, and was transported to Bellevue Hospital in critical condition. She died on March 14 due to a traumatic brain injury, police said. Gustern was known for coaching Blondie singer Debbie Harry and the cast of the Broadway musical Oklahoma! Pazienza’s arrest came days after police released photos of her at a subway station as they sought the public’s help in identifying her. “This is a disgusting and disgraceful offense committed against a vulnerable, elderly woman doing nothing but walking down the streets of New York City,” the NYPD’s Chief of Detectives James Essig said at the time, according to the New York Daily News. Gustern’s funeral is scheduled for March 26. Her family has been hosting viewings of her apartment for close associates, according to Gustern’s Facebook page. Read more at The Daily Beast.

3/23/2022,"The confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson began on Monday and, as expected, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee were a little concerned about President Biden’s pick to replace Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court. Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) went so far as to suggest to Jackson, a Black woman, that white privilege doesn’t exist in America, a country where of the 114 justices to have been confirmed to sit on the highest court in the land, only two have been Black. “You serve on the board of a school that teaches kindergartners, five-year-old children, that they can choose their gender, and that teaches them about so-called white privilege,” Blackburn said after bashing the “radical left.” More from Rolling Stone Biden Nominates Ketanji Brown Jackson to Supreme Court Republicans, White Nationalists Fume Over Taylor Swift's Senate Endorsement Amid War Crimes in Ukraine, American Right Wingers Are Applauding Russia Blackburn continued to drill down on critical race theory, the GOP’s culture-war topic du jour. “You have praised the 1619 Project, which argues the U.S. is a fundamentally racist country, and you have made clear that you believe judges must consider critical race theory when deciding how to sentence criminal defendants,” she said. “Is it your personal hidden agenda to incorporate critical race theory into our legal system?” Blackburn wasn’t the only Republican to touch on race on Monday. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) spent most of his opening statement whining about Democrats’ treatment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh after they wanted to question the then-nominee after he was credibly accused of rape, but he also echoed widespread GOP concern that Jackson’s skin color had more to do with her nomination than her credentials. “I want the Supreme Court to look more like the country, but I want it to operate within the confines of the Constitution,” he said. The Washington Post pointed out on Sunday that, if confirmed, Jackson would be the only active Supreme Court justice to have attended an Ivy League law school, clerked for a Supreme Court justice, served as a public defender, served on the sentencing commission, served as a U.S. District Court judge, and served as a U.S. Court of Appeals judge.

3/23/2022,"Ukraine says it has killed 15,000 of Russia's troops since its invasion began. The country's military branch, the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, said on Monday that a large proportion of Russia's total invading troops are dead. Russia started its invasion on 24 February with an estimated force of 190,000 troops. Ukraine's military also claimed that it had taken out a number of the enemy's armoury and artillery, the Kyiv Independent reported. Watch: Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko says he cries 'every day' at destruction Putin has caused Officials said they had destroyed 1,535 armoured personnel carriers, 498 tanks, 969 vehicles, 240 pieces of artillery, 45 anti-aircraft systems, 80 rocket launcher systems, 97 planes and 121 helicopters. Meanwhile, eight people were reported dead on Monday following Russian shelling on a residential area and shopping centre in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. In the port city of Mariupol, which has been under heavy Russian bombardment, an estimated 300,000 people are trapped without food, water or power. Ukraine ignored a demand from Russia to give up the city by 5am Moscow time on Monday, saying the invaders' pledge to temporarily halt its attack could not be trusted.   It accused Russia of trying to starve out its citizens in the city. Ukrainian MP Inna Sovsun also claimed its citizens in Mariupol are being abducted and deported to ""distant parts of Russia"" to work in conditions akin to slave labour. Speaking to Times Radio, she said Russia was following “the logic of Nazi Germany”. “From what we know from the city mayor and the city council, is they are taking Ukrainian citizens,” she said. The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said she was ""appalled"" by the claims. On Sunday, a Russian bomb destroyed an art school in Mariupol where 400 people had taken shelter, with rescuers searching for people possibly trapped under the rubble. Only days before the shelling, there was a separate attack on a theatre in the city where more than 1,000 people were said to have been hiding.

She said Russian president Vladimir Putin is ""resorting to desperate measures as he is not achieving his objectives"". On Monday, health secretary Sajid Javid said the UK could welcome hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian refugees in the coming weeks. After the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme opened at the weekend, Javid said those arriving in the UK would get all the support they needed. Some 10,200 visas have been issued under the Ukraine family scheme as of 4pm on Sunday, the Home Office said on Monday. A total of 31,500 applications have been submitted so far. Javid said 150,000 people had expressed an interest in hosting refugees through the Homes for Ukraine programme.
