4/27/2022,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A 3-month-old baby who was kidnapped from his San Francisco Bay Area home was found Tuesday and three suspects were detained, police said. The baby, Brandon Cuellar, was taken to a hospital as a precaution, the San Jose Police Department announced on Twitter, without saying where the boy was located. The announcement came shortly after police told reporters that a woman had been detained as “a person of interest"" in the case after what authorities called inconsistencies in her statements to police about the kidnapping. Authorities then said that three suspects overall were detained but did not disclose whether the woman was among the suspects. The child was taken Monday from his apartment in San Jose by a man, who entered the home and was seen on video walking away with the baby in a carrier. The woman taken into custody, who has not been identified, was with the child’s grandmother before little Brandon Cuellar was abducted Monday by an unknown man, San Jose Police spokesman Sgt. Christian Camarillo told reporters Tuesday. “This was a person who was with the grandmother yesterday when they went shopping, she was present at the apartment complex when this happened,” he said. “There have been some inconsistencies with what she has told us. Obviously, drawing our attention to what she knows about this.” Police released a video showing the man walking down the sidewalk holding the baby carrier covered by a white blanket. “The family does not recognize this suspect,” police initially tweeted. Camarillo told reporters Monday that the kidnapping was reported by the baby's grandmother. “According to the grandmother, she came home to this apartment.... She took the baby in the apartment, went downstairs to unload some groceries,"" Camarillo said. ""In that short amount of time someone entered the apartment ... and left with the baby.” Brandon was last seen wearing a white long-sleeved onesie with dinosaurs. Camarillo said the baby's mother was at work when the abduction happened. “Dad right now is out of the picture. He is incarcerated. I don't know, you know, whether that is going to play into this, but obviously we are going to talk to him soon,” Camarillo said. He said it was hard to make out the man who took the baby because he was wearing a mask.",U.S./Associated Press,Kidnapped California baby found and 3 suspects detained,https://news.yahoo.com/california-police-fbi-search-baby-153152465.html
4/27/2022,"WARSAW, Poland — Poland’s prime minister has confirmed the country supplied its Soviet-designed T-72 tanks to Ukraine to support the fight against Russia, which invaded Ukraine Feb. 24. The announcement came shortly after his British counterpart Boris Johnson unveiled plans to supply an undisclosed number of Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to “backfill” the operational needs of its military. “We have received gap fillers, elements of our armament,” Mateusz Morawiecki said during an interview with local news channel Polsat News, referring to weapons the U.S. and the U.K. have provided to Poland since the war began. “Today, our weapons are used to defend our independence, but 500 kilometers from the Polish border.” Asked about how many T-72s were delivered to the Ukrainian armed forces, Morawiecki said “when the time comes, we will provide this” information. In 2019, Poland’s Defence Ministry signed a contract with a consortium of local companies, led by state-run defense giant PGZ, to upgrade up to 318 tanks to the T-72M1 version. Earlier this month, Poland signed a deal worth about $4.75 billion to buy 250 M1A2 Abrams SEPv3 tanks from the U.S. The Polish prime minister also referred to an earlier plan by Warsaw to supply Soviet-designed Mikoyan MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine. The initiative was eventually scrapped, and Morawiecki said Ukraine was no longer seeking delivery of such aircraft by Poland.",World/Defense News,"Poland confirms T-72 tank delivery to Ukraine, with Challenger 2 tanks to fill gap",https://news.yahoo.com/poland-confirms-t-72-tank-172605674.html
4/27/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Russia will halt gas flows to Poland on Wednesday in a major escalation in the standoff between Moscow and Europe over energy supplies and the war in Ukraine.

Europe has said that doing so would breach sanctions and strengthen Russia’s hand unacceptably. Poland has been particularly vociferous in its criticism of Russia over the war. Poland’s main gas supplier PGNiG said it has been informed that all flows will stop from Wednesday. Minutes earlier, Russian gas giant Gazprom issued a warning that Poland must pay up for its gas supplies on Tuesday -- in the Russian currency. “I can confirm we’ve received such threats from Gazprom which are linked among other things to the means of payment,” Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki told reporters in Berlin. “Poland is sticking to the arrangements and maybe Russia will try to punish Poland” by cutting deliveries. European gas prices surged as much as 17% as traders calculated the risk of other European countries being hit next. The threat of cutoffs has been looming for weeks, but there was an indication last week that the European Union was suggesting a potential way out of the standoff. EU Suggests Companies Should Keep Paying for Russia Gas in Euros Late April and May is when the payments for April gas supplies fall due -- the first batch for which the new terms apply -- and European officials and executives are in many cases still trying to figure out how best to respond. Europe is hugely dependent on Russian gas, and has so far mostly shielded energy from sanctions. “The possible cut may set a precedent for additional curtailments following Russia’s request for payment in rubles,” Patricio Alvarez, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence said. Gazprom had no immediate comment. Poland has been preparing for life without Russian gas, and the government said on Tuesday it has enough fuel in storage. Warsaw has been calling for tougher sanctions on Russia but has run into opposition from other EU nations.
