2/26/2022,"ADAZI MILITARY BASE, Latvia (Reuters) - The presence of U.S. and other NATO troops in Latvia sends a message to Vladimir Putin that Russia should stay away, Latvian Defence Minister Artis Pabriks said on Friday as he greeted a small deployment of U.S. soldiers. The group of some forty U.S. service members arrived from Italy early on Thursday - before hostilities in Ukraine began. The deployment is expected to grow to more than 300 soldiers. ""We are a small country. We are ready to do whatever is needed to defend ourselves. We are not afraid to die for that. But we might be overwhelmed, so this is very much why we welcome you here,"" Pabriks told the troops in Adazi military base on Friday. Russia invaded Ukraine by land sea and air on Thursday after massing more than 150,000 troops around the country's borders including in Latvia's neighbour Belarus. Latvia, together with Baltic neighbours Estonia and Lithuania, was once ruled by Moscow. They had long seen Russia as a security threat. But unlike Ukraine, the three countries joined the European Union and NATO, which brings security guarantees. NATO's founding treaty contains an article on collective defence stating that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all members. ""We are not afraid that somebody might invade us, but the signal that U.S. soldiers are with us, and that other allies, from Canadians to Europeans are with us, is a good signal to Putin - don't mess with us,"" Pabriks said. Over the past two days the United States has sent the troops to Latvia as well as advanced F-35 fighter aircraft to Lithuania and Estonia. It has also announced it will not be withdrawing 500 troops in Lithuania in April, as planned. About twenty U.S. Apache helicopters landed in Latvia on Wednesday.

2/26/2022,"China appeared to be less than thrilled with the aggressive military actions taken in Ukraine on Thursday by President Xi Jinping's self-described ""best friend,"" Vladimir Putin. At a briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying expressed that ""China did not wish to see what happened in Ukraine today,"" and deflected allegations that Beijing was providing backing for the attack, The Washington Post reports. ""As for American hints that Russia had China backing it up, I'm sure Russia would be pleased to hear it,"" Hua said. ""We won't be like America and provide Ukraine a large amount of military equipment. Russia as a powerful nation also does not need China or other countries to provide [military assistance]."" China remains in an unenviable position of trying to balance calls for restraint and calm with its friendly relations with Moscow. The nation's proxies attempted again on Thursday to express both acknowledgment of Ukraine's territorial integrity as well as Russia's ""reasonable security concerns,"" the Post adds. China has also blamed the U.S. for the deterioration of relations. ​​""A key question here is what role the U.S., the culprit of current tensions surrounding Ukraine, has played,"" Hua said on Wednesday.

2/26/2022,"An international relations expert is warning that the attacks on Ukraine by Russian forces will lead to dire consequences unless the leaders of other nations change how they deal with Russia - and that includes Canada. Russia is in the midst of invading Ukraine from land, sea and air, zeroing in on cities and military targets. Aurel Braun is a professor of international relations and political science at the University of Toronto, as well as an associate at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies Harvard University. He says so far, leaders in countries like the U.S. have used tactics that are too soft, which is why Russia is escalating its presence in the Ukraine. Unless we change our collective approach to Russia, we’re not going to be able to stop this. It’s likely to get worse. Not because Putin is some mad aggressor who wants to conquer countries all over the world, but because he’s an opportunist who will take whatever he can if he finds weakness.
Aurel Braun, Professor of International Relations and Political Science, University of Toronto It appears sanctions against Russia haven’t been enough. Braun says the lack of defence armament from other countries makes Ukraine a soft target. Meanwhile, diplomacy talks with the US have only appeared to make Putin more emboldened. Domestically, Canada is close to Ukraine because of the large diaspora that live here. When it comes to our role in the current situation, Canada has sent $7.8 million for lethal military equipment, which Braun says would add up to roughly three hours of ammunition. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has issued a first round of sanctions against Russia and more troops have been sent to Europe. About 400 Canadian troops have been stationed in Latvia for the last several years, which Braun says puts Canada closer to the frontlines. If Mr. Putin decides to attack Latvia, Canadians soldiers will die, it’s that basic,” he says. “This is very real for Canada. We’re not bystanders.
Aurel Braun, Professor of International Relations and Political Science, University of Toronto Another thing to consider is Canada’s geographical position across the Atlantic Ocean from Russia. The Arctic has become an important and contested area, thanks to its vast natural resources – 20 to 30 per cent of the world’s hydrocarbons are there. It's also an incredibly fragile ecological area, so that if an accident were to occur there, it would be catastrophic. Though Canada has banned any exploration in most areas of the Arctic, Russia has moved full steam ahead with exploration, since 60 per cent of their exports are hydrocarbons. “They’re not restrained by the Glasgow or Paris Agreements,” says Braun. “They’ve paid lip service to it, but in reality they’ve disregarded it...any accident would have horrific effects to the Canadian Arctic coastline.” Russia has militarized the Arctic since it’s becoming more of a strategic area for them, which directly affects Canada. “If we don’t deter Russia, Canada’s is going to be affected directly,” Braun says. “Materially, ecologically, and strategically.”",News/Yahoo News Canada,"'If we don’t deter Russia, Canada is going to be affected directly': Attacks on Ukraine could threaten security of Canada",https://news.yahoo.com/canada-russia-ukraine-war-impact-arctic-security-172703258.html

2/26/2022,"Traffic cameras are great for checking traffic flow, weather conditions and crash sites. On Wednesday morning, one York County camera was also good for catching a pair of men who appear to be stealing a road sign. A state Department of Transportation employee was doing a routine camera check and saw two men taking a sign on Interstate 83 in the area of the southbound Shrewsbury exit ramp, according to safety press officer Fritzi Schreffler. The camera showed two men clearly taking one of two signs from that spot and placing it in the back of a silver pickup.

The sign alone would cost $600 to replace, but that doesn't include the post or labor to install it, according to PennDOT. Schreffler said the PennDOT employee reported the incident to Pennsylvania State Police, who picked up the men. She said it’s highly unusual to capture something like this. “Usually we get stuff after the fact,” Schreffler said. “We get calls all of the time requesting video of crashes or whatever, but typically our cameras are facing the other way.” Each shift performs a run through all of the cameras to make sure they are working. PSP didn’t have the specifics of the incident when asked late Wednesday morning. After the men left their spot on the shoulder of I-83, they stopped in a lot next to a PennDOT stockpile to further secure the sign, Schreffler said.

2/26/2022,"As part of their invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces have used insignia of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to descend on several cities in the Luhansk region, Ukraine’s National Police warned Thursday. “Columns of Russian tanks entered the Luhansk region at the borders of Krasnaya Talovka, Milove, and Gorodishche. The enemy insidiously placed white vehicles with OSCE symbols at the front. Fighting is currently underway there,” police said in a statement. International monitors from the OSCE have been working along the frontline in Eastern Ukraine since 2014 to document fighting and ultimately help reduce tensions. The organization has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and called for an end to the war. We Have Failed Ukraine—and All Those Erased By Putin Similarly deceptive tactics by invading forces were reported elsewhere in the country. After Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the alarming news that Russian forces were trying to “seize” the Chernobyl nuclear plant, the site of the worst-ever nuclear disaster, residents in the area were quoted telling the UNIAN news agency that they had seen the troops make their way through by dressing up as peacekeepers. They reportedly made their way through in white trucks and armored vehicles that had “something like red flags” on the front. Elsewhere, in Sarny, Rivne, Mayor Ruslan Serpeninov issued a video address to residents, warning them that sabotage and reconnaissance units were entering the country from Belarus wearing Ukrainian military and police uniforms. He said the imposters were wearing red ribbons—a claim echoed by the National Police. The police service called on citizens nationwide to be on the lookout for “suspicious people on the streets,” particularly those with “elements of red.” They called on residents to call police immediately to report “suspicious people with elements of red on their clothes.” The disguises were part of a multi-faceted attack Russia launched against Ukraine at dawn Thursday, after denying for weeks that any invasion was in the works. More than a dozen Ukrainians were reported dead in the first few hours of the offensive, some of them civilians. Read more at The Daily Beast.

2/26/2022,"PARIS (Reuters) -France's foreign minister said that Russian President Vladimir Putin, when making threats about using nuclear weapons, needs to understand that NATO, too, is a nuclear alliance, but he ruled out NATO-led military intervention to defend Ukraine. Asked whether Putin's threat of ""such consequences that you have never encountered in your history"" was tantamount to threatening Russian use nuclear weapons in the Ukraine conflict, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was indeed understood as such. ""Yes, I think that Vladimir Putin must also understand that the Atlantic alliance is a nuclear alliance. That is all I will say about this,"" Le Drian said on Thursday on French television TF1. Speaking from the Kremlin on Thursday morning as he launched the Russian military's invasion of Ukraine, Putin said Russia would respond instantly if any external force tried to interfere with its actions. ""Whoever tries to hinder us, and even more so, to create threats to our country, to our people, should know that Russia's response will be immediate. And it will lead you to such consequences that you have never encountered in your history,"" the Russian president said. Western leaders on Thursday threatened unprecedented economic sanctions against Russia, but none have argued for a NATO-led military intervention to defend Ukraine. Ukraine is not a NATO ally, and the alliance is not treaty-bound to protect it. Asked why NATO member states -- which in past decades have intervened militarily in non-NATO countries such as Afghanistan, Libya and former Yugoslavia -- are refusing to put soldiers on the ground in Ukraine, Le Drian said: ""That is not what the Ukrainians are asking us"". He said Ukraine is asking for humanitarian and financial help, as well as military equipment, which the West has provided and will continue to provide. Asked what weaponry NATO could provide, Le Drian said ""they have made a list and we are studying that list in order to meet their requests as soon as possible"". Asked whether Europe and NATO could continue to rule out a military response despite the presence of Russian soldiers in Ukraine and Putin's threat of nuclear apocalypse, Le Drian said sanctions will be more efficient.

2/26/2022,"PRAGUE (AP) — Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has shocked the former Soviet satellite states of Central and Eastern Europe, drawing strong condemnation even from the region’s most pro-Kremlin politicians. For some of the countries that fled the Soviet bloc following a series of anti-communist revolutions more than 30 years ago, footage of tanks and troops rolling in to punish a nation trying to pursue its own independent course looks painfully familiar. Two until now major pro-Russian voices in the European Union, Czech President Milos Zeman and Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban, didn't mince their words in criticizing Moscow’s most aggressive action since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Their countries experienced comparable brutality — the Czech Republic, as part of Czechoslovakia, in 1968 and Hungary in 1956. Zeman called Thursday's invasion “an unprovoked act of aggression.” “Russia has committed a crime against peace,” he said in an address to the nation. Zeman had previously made news by calling Russia’s 2014 annexation of the Ukrainian Crimean Peninsula “a fait accompli.” Many in the Czech Republic reviled Zeman as a “servant of Kremlin” after he sided with Russia and cast doubt on the findings of his own security and intelligence services on the alleged participation of Russian spies in a huge 2014 ammunition explosion. Until just days ago, Zeman was insisting that the Russians wouldn't attack Ukraine because “they aren’t lunatics to launch an operation that would be more damaging for them than beneficial.” “I admit I was wrong,” he said Thursday. Zeman has called for harsh sanctions against Russia, including cutting it out of the SWIFT financial system which shuffles money from bank to bank around the globe. “It’s necessary to isolate a lunatic and not just to defend ourselves by words but also by deeds,” he said. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala also voiced full support for the strongest possible sanctions for what he called “an absolutely unjustified act of aggression against a sovereign state.” Prague ordered the closure of two Russian consulates in the Czech Republic and stopped accepting visa requests from Russian citizens. Pavel Rychetsky, the chief judge at the Constitutional court, the country’s highest legal authority, suggested that a European arrest warrant should be issued against Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said Putin should be tried at the International Criminal Court for “an unprecedented unleashing of war on the European continent for the first time since World War II.” In Hungary, high ranking officials had for weeks avoided condemning Russia’s actions directly. Under Orban, the country has pursued close ties with Putin, a point of concern for many of Hungary’s western partners. Hungary has historically deeply distrusted Moscow, which ordered the brutal repression of an anti-Soviet uprising in 1956. But Orban in recent years has pursued a diplomatic and economic strategy he calls “Eastern Opening,” which favors closer ties with countries to the east, and in his frequent battles with the EU has called the 27-nation bloc an oppressive imperial power similar to Hungary’s former Soviet occupiers. But on Thursday, Orban was clear in his condemnation of the Kremlin. “Russia attacked Ukraine this morning with military force,” Orban said in a video on Facebook. “Together with our European Union and NATO allies, we condemn Russia’s military action.” “Hungary’s position is clear: we stand by Ukraine, we stand by Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” his Foreign Minister Peter Szijijarto said. Bulgaria, Moscow’s closest ally during the Cold War, followed suit. “Having strategic bombers and missiles flying in Europe in the 21st century, assaults by air and sea against a sovereign state, is absolutely inadmissible,” President Rumen Radev said. Romania also stood staunchly with its western partners. “Through today’s cynical invasion, the Russian Federation is the architect of the worst security crisis since World War II,” the ruling coalition leaders said. Neighboring Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of the few former communist Eastern European countries not to have joined NATO so far, echoed these views. Moldovan President Maia Sandu stressed that Russia’s attacks were launched “in violation of international norms,” adding that the international community “unanimously condemns these military actions.” ___ Justin Spike in Budapest, Hungary, Veselin Toskov in Sofia, Bulgaria and Stephen McGrath in Bucharest, Romania, contributed. ___ Follow AP’s coverage of the Ukraine crisis at https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine",World/Associated Press,"By invading Ukraine, Putin loses allies in eastern Europe",https://news.yahoo.com/invading-ukraine-putin-loses-allies-201605774.html

2/26/2022,"A tense confrontation between the House select committee investigating the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol and Kimberly Guilfoyle unfolded privately on Friday morning, with Guilfoyle and her lawyers abruptly ending her conversation with the committee over concerns about its ground rules, according to four people familiar with the exchange. Guilfoyle, a longtime adviser to former President Donald Trump, was scheduled to meet virtually with the committee on February 25, following discussions between the committee and her lawyers. Guilfoyle is engaged to Donald Trump Jr., the former president's eldest son, and is one of the most high-profile confidants of the Trump family to meet with the committee. She also spoke at the January 6, 2021, rally at the Ellipse near the White House and was backstage that day with the Trump family and administration officials. The four people familiar with Friday's exchange requested anonymity, since they were not authorized to discuss the deliberations. But, they said, when Guilfoyle appeared on Friday's virtual meeting, she and her lawyers grew immediately concerned when they saw who else was on the call, including lawmakers on the committee such as Representatives Adam Schiff of California and Jamie Raskin of Maryland, both Democrats. Guilfoyle spoke up and asked why members — and not just lawyers and committee staff — were on the call, three of the people said. ""Kim balked and said this isn't my understanding,"" one of the people said. A second person described her as ""outraged,"" since she believed this conversation was going to be more informative and not a formal deposition. ""This is not my understanding,"" Guilfoyle told the committee, and then said she would cease to continue the conversation until her lawyers had further discussions with the committee about the format, the people said. Committee spokesman Tim Mulvey confirmed in a statement that Guilfoyle will now not be cooperating with the committee, and suggested she would face a subpoena: ""Ms. Guilfoyle has information of interest to the Select Committee and has provided documents germane to our investigation. The Select Committee had hoped she would do as dozens of other witnesses have done: participate in a voluntary transcribed interview with staff and committee members. Ms. Guilfoyle has now declined to do so, forcing the Select Committee to compel her testimony at an upcoming deposition."" Guilfoyle agreed to Friday's conversation with the understanding that a subpoena could be issued if she did not engage with the committee, two of the people said.  When contacted for comment by CBS News, Joseph Tacopina, counsel for Guilfoyle, issued a statement accusing the committee of leaking details of the exchange. ""Ms. Guilfoyle, under threat of subpoena, agreed to meet exclusively with counsel for the Select Committee in a good faith effort to provide true and relevant evidence,"" the statement said. ""However, upon Ms. Guilfoyle's attendance, the Committee revealed its untrustworthiness, as members notorious for leaking information appeared. Then, while counsel briefly halted the meeting to address the matter, our concerns about the presence of the Committee's members were validated, as the Committee within less than two minutes leaked news of the break to the media, as Chairman [Bennie] Thompson did only a month earlier when revealing to the press that our client's phone records had been confidentially subpoenaed."" The statement went on to assert that when Guilfoyle's lawyers contacted the committee about this story, ""they too were shocked and appalled"" and believed this story was based on a politically-motivated ""leak.""

2/26/2022,"By Arshad Mohammed and Jonathan Landay WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian and Ukrainian forces fought on Thursday for control of Chernobyl, the still radioactive site of the world's worst nuclear accident and a factor in the collapse of the Soviet Union. ""Our defenders are giving their lives so that the tragedy of 1986 will not be repeated,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy tweeted before the defunct nuclear power plant, scene of a deadly fire and explosion in 1986, was captured by Russian forces. But why would anyone want an inoperative power plant surrounded by miles of radioactive land? The answer is geography: Chernobyl sits on the shortest route from Belarus to Kyiv, Ukrainian's capital, and so runs along a logical line of attack for the Russian forces invading Ukraine. In seizing Chernobyl, Western military analysts said Russia was simply using the fastest invasion route from Belarus, an ally of Moscow and a staging ground for Russian troops, to Kyiv. ""It was the quickest way from A to B,"" said James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. Jack Keane, a former chief of the U.S. Army staff, said Chernobyl ""doesn’t have any military significance"" but sits on the shortest route from Belarus to Kyiv, the target of a Russian ""decapitation"" strategy to oust the Ukrainian government. Keane called the route one of four ""axes"" Russian forces used to invade Ukraine, including a second vector from Belarus, an advance south into the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, and a push north out of Russian-controlled Crimea to the city of Kherson. The combined offensives amounted to the biggest attack on a European state since World War Two. Taking Chernobyl was part of the plan, and a senior Ukrainian official said it was captured on Thursday by Russian forces, though a senior U.S. defense official said the United States could not confirm this. The fourth reactor at Chernobyl, 67 miles (108 km) north of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, exploded in April 1986 during a botched safety test, sending clouds of radiation billowing across much of Europe and reaching the eastern United States. The radioactive strontium, caesium and plutonium mainly affected Ukraine and neighboring Belarus, as well as parts of Russia and Europe. Estimates for the numbers of direct and indirect deaths from the disaster vary from the low thousands to as many as 93,000 extra cancer deaths worldwide. Soviet authorities initially sought to cover up the disaster and did not immediately admit to the explosion, tarnishing the image of reformist Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and his ""glasnost"" policies for greater openness in Soviet society. The catastrophe was widely seen as contributing to the collapse of the Soviet Union just a few years later. Acton said Russia's capture of Chernobyl on Thursday was not to protect it from further damage, saying Ukraine's four active nuclear power plants present a greater risk than Chernobyl, which sits within a vast ""exclusion zone"" roughly the size of Luxembourg. A make-shift cover, or ""sarcophagus,"" was built within six months of the disaster to cover the stricken reactor and protect the environment from radiation. In November 2016, a so-called ""New Safe Confinement"" was moved over the old sarcophagus. ""Obviously an accident within Chernobyl would be a big issue. But precisely because of the exclusion zone, it probably wouldn't impinge on Ukrainian civilians very much,"" Acton said. Ukraine's four operational nuclear power plants are running safely and there has been no ""destruction"" at the remaining waste and other facilities at Chernobyl, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Thursday, citing Ukraine's nuclear regulator. Acton said Ukraine's other reactors are not in exclusion zones and they contain nuclear fuel that is a lot more radioactive. ""The risks of fighting around them are significantly higher.""

2/26/2022,"Sharks are notorious for chomping on hooked fish before anglers can reel them in, but one Australian fisherman learned the hard way that sharks will also eat other sharks, too. Jason Moyce — known as “Trapman Bermagui” on social media — had not one, but three sharks bitten in half as he pulled them in this week, including two hammerheads. It happened Tuesday, Feb. 22, off the coast of New South Wales in southern Australia, and Moyce posted photos of the three sharks with a series of complaints about his worsening luck. “Plenty of smooth hammerhead sharks around. But getting a whole one to the boat is a challenge,” the Trapman Bermagui Facebook page reported after it happened the second time. Then a dusky shark — also called a “bronzie” — was pulled in, missing everything beyond its front fins. Clearly, much bigger predators were nearby, he concluded. “Even the bronzies aren’t safe today,” he wrote. “No more shark fishing for us. Too many big units around.” Hungry sharks are known for “tail fishing boats” off Australia in search of easy meals, Moyce told 9news.com.au. However, in this case, it appeared the boat had attracted some rather large sharks. “There were just too many big ones,” Moyce told the station. “They were down deep, I couldn’t see them but I think they were tiger sharks.” Tiger sharks can reach nearly 11 feet off Australia, according to New South Whales government data. Moyce, “a second generation pro fisherman,” said he wasn’t the only one having troubles that day. Anglers on a recreational boat caught a mako shark and “found a smaller mako, bitten in two in its stomach,” according to a post on the Trapman Bermagui Facebook page. It included a photo of both sharks. Waters off Australia are home to about 170 species of shark, with the biggest concentration (50 species) living in the Coral Sea, according to Australiangeographic.com. Among them is the great white shark, a species linked to the Feb. 16 killing of diving instructor Simon Nellist as he swam near a Sydney Beach, the BBC reports.

2/26/2022,"As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, former U.S. Presidents such as George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter have spoken up about their concerns and condemned the events that have transpired. According to The Hill, former president Barack Obama has joined voices of the international community stating Russia’s attack is a “violation of international law” and the “basic principles of human decency” in a statement he released.

And every American, regardless of party, should support President Biden’s efforts, in coordination with our closest allies, to impose hard-hitting sanctions on Russia — sanctions that impose a real price on Russia’s autocratic elites,” Obama wrote. Former President Obama also noted the historical implications of this event–stating the consequences of Russia’s “illegal” and “reckless actions” will extend beyond Ukraine’s borders. “For some time now, we have seen the forces of division and authoritarianism make headway around the world, mounting an assault on the ideals of democracy, rule of law, equality, individual liberty, freedom of expression and worship, and self-determination. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows where these dangerous trends can lead — and why they cannot be left unchallenged,” he said. Obama also spoke to ramifications with sanctions and how they may serve a greater good in the long run: “There may be some economic consequences to such sanctions, given Russia’s significant role in world energy markets. But that’s a price would be willing to pay to take a stand on the side of freedom,” he continued. “For over the long term, we all face a choice, between a world in which might makes right and autocrats are free to impose their will through force, or a world in which free people everywhere have the power to determine their own future.” Yesterday, President Joe Biden imposed a new round of sanctions against Russia, including export blocks on technology, Russian banks, and “corrupt billionaires” and their families close to the Kremlin.

2/26/2022,"MOSCOW (AP) — Shocked Russians turned out by the thousands Thursday to decry their country's invasion of Ukraine as emotional calls for protests grew on social media. Some 1,745 people in 54 Russian cities were detained, at least 957 of them in Moscow. Hundreds of posts came pouring in condemning Moscow’s most aggressive actions since the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Vladimir Putin called the attack a “special military operation” to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine from “genocide” — a false claim the U.S. had predicted would be a pretext for invasion, and which many Russians roundly rejected. Tatyana Usmanova, an opposition activist in Moscow, wrote on Facebook that she thought she was dreaming when she awoke at 5:30 a.m. to the news, which she called “a disgrace that will be forever with us now.” “I want to ask Ukrainians for forgiveness. We didn’t vote for those who unleashed the war,” she said. There have been protests in different countries against the Russian attack on Ukraine. As sirens blasted in Kyiv, Ukraine's capital, and large explosions were heard there and in other cities, Russians were signing open letters and online petitions demanding the Kremlin halt the assault, which the Ukrainian health minister said had killed at least 57 Ukrainians and wounded dozens more. “Public opinion is in shock, people are in shock,” political analyst Abbas Gallyamov told The Associated Press. One petition, started by a prominent human rights advocate, Lev Ponomavyov, garnered over 150,000 signatures within several hours and more than 330,000 by the end of the day. More than 250 journalists put their names on an open letter decrying the aggression. Another one was signed by some 250 scientists, while 194 municipal council members in Moscow and other cities signed a third. “I’m worried about the people very much, I’m worried to tears,” said Zoya Vorobey, a resident of Korolyov, a town outside Moscow, her voice cracking. “I’ve been watching television since this morning, every minute, to see if anything changes. Unfortunately, nothing.” Several Russian celebrities and public figures, including some working for state TV, spoke out against the attack. Yelena Kovalskaya, director of a state-funded Moscow theater, announced on Facebook she was quitting her job, saying “it's impossible to work for a killer and get paid by him.” ""I know that right now many of you feel desperation, helplessness, shame over Vladimir Putin's attack on the friendly nation of Ukraine. But I urge you not to despair,"" human rights activist Marina Litvinovich said in a video statement on Facebook, calling for mass protests Thursday evening. “We, the Russian people, are against the war Putin has unleashed. We don't support this war, it is being waged not on our behalf,” Litvinovich said. But the authorities were having none of that. In Moscow and other cities, they moved swiftly to crack down on critical voices. Litvinovich was detained outside of her residence shortly after posting the protest call. OVD-Info, a rights group that tracks political arrests, reported that 1,745 people in 54 cities had been detained by Thursday evening, at least 957 of them in Moscow. Russia's Investigative Committee issued a warning Thursday afternoon reminding Russians that unauthorized protests are against the law. Roskomnadzor, state communications and media watchdog, demanded that Russian media use “information and data they get only from official Russian sources.” Some media reported that employees of certain state-funded companies were instructed not to comment publicly on the events in Ukraine. Human rights advocates warned of a new wave of repression on dissent. “There will be new (criminal) cases involving subverters, spies, treason, prosecution for antiwar protests, there will be detentions of journalists and bloggers, those who authored critical posts on social media, bans on investigations of the situation in the army and so on,"" prominent human rights advocate Pavel Chikov wrote on Facebook. ""It is hard to say how big this new wave will be, given that everything has been suppressed already.” Despite the pressure from the authorities, more than 1,000 people gathered in the center of Moscow Thursday evening, chanting “No to war!” as passing cars honked their horns. Hundreds also took to the streets in St. Petersburg and dozens in Yekaterinburg. “This is the most shameful and terrible day in my life. I even was not able to go to work. My country is an aggressor. I hate Putin. What else should be done to make people open their eyes?"" Yekaterina Kuznetsova, 40-year-old engineer who joined the demonstration in St. Petersburg, told the AP. Russia's official line in the meantime remained intransigent. Speaker of the upper house of parliament, Valentina Matviyenko charged that those who spoke out against the attack were only caring about their “momentary problems.” State TV painted the attack in line with what Putin said in his televised address announcing it. Russia 1 TV host Olga Skabeyeva called it an effort “to protect people in Donbas from a Nazi regime"" and said it was “without exaggeration, a crucial junction in history.” — AP writer Kirill Zarubin contributed to this report from Korolyov, Russia.",World/Associated Press,Hundreds arrested as shocked Russians protest Ukraine attack,https://news.yahoo.com/russians-react-shock-outrage-attack-193719034.html
2/26/2022,"Up to 70% of the US population can take off their masks, according to new CDC guidance. The agency relaxed mask recommendations for counties with low and medium levels of COVID-19. The guidance reflects the CDC's narrower focus on minimizing severe disease. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed mask guidelines for up to 70% of the US population, or 63% of US counties, on Friday. People in counties with low and medium levels of COVID-19 no longer need to wear masks in public, the agency said — though people with an increased risk of severe COVID-19, such as immunocompromised people, should talk to their healthcare providers about removing masks if they live in a medium-level county. People in counties with high levels of COVID-19 — 37% of US counties right now — still should wear masks in indoor public settings, including schools, according to the CDC. The agency still recommends that everyone get vaccinated and boosted, if they haven't already, and test themselves if they feel sick. People with COVID-19 symptoms, a positive COVID-19 test, or exposure to someone with COVID-19 should continue to mask up, regardless of transmission rates in their area, the CDC said. The map below shows where your county sits on the CDC's new scale. Counties with low levels of COVID-19 are marked in green and encompass 30% of US residents. Counties with medium levels are in yellow and hold 42% of US residents. Counties with high levels are in orange and hold 28% of US residents. The new recommendations reflect the CDC's narrower focus on minimizing severe disease, limiting strain on hospitals, and protecting the most vulnerable people. ""The overall risk of severe disease is now generally lower,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a Friday press briefing. ""Now, as the virus continues to circulate in our communities, we must focus our metrics beyond just cases in the community."" Green counties must have fewer than 200 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents, fewer than 10 new COVID-19 hospital admissions per 100,000 residents, and fewer than 10% of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients on average within the past week. Here's how those metrics compare to yellow and orange counties. Masking is still an option for people in areas with low or medium levels of COVID-19, the CDC added, particularly if they live with someone who is at high risk of severe disease. The guidance is also subject to change, Walensky said. ""None of us know what the future may hold for us and for this virus,"" she said. ""We need to be prepared, and we need to be ready for whatever comes next. We want to give people a break from things like mask-wearing when our levels are low and then have the ability to reach for them again, should things get worse in the future.""

2/26/2022,"A woman realized she was being catfished by one of her dating app matches after receiving green texts messages from him. While there are jokes — and even real studies — about the differences between Android and iPhone users, in this case Jocelyn (@jjustjocelyn) wasn’t turned off because she was texting an Android user, but by the fact that it contradicted something in the man’s Bumble profile. See this bedroom turn into a vibrant oasis after an incredible one-day renovation: Jocelyn uploaded a video explaining that she had matched with a “good looking” guy named Myles and, after exchanging a few messages, decided to give Myles her phone number. Myles reached out to make dinner plans and Joceyln was confused by the green messages because Myles was clearly wearing an Apple Watch in one of the photos on his profile. “What does green mean?” Jocelyn asked, referring to Myles’ texts. “It means he does not have an iPhone.” While it’s not impossible to own an Android and wear an Apple Watch, pairing the two devices is not recommended because of the number of issues that will crop up with the two different operating systems. Plus, an Apple Watch needs to be connected to an iPhone during the initial setup. Before replying to Myles’ text about dinner, Jocelyn decided to do some investigating. “I do a reverse image search of some of the pictures that he used on his profile and what do we have here? An Instagram model from New York,” Jocelyn said. “I live in Ontario.” Jocelyn’s video has since racked up over 1 million views since she posted it, with Bumble’s TikTok account even commenting an apology. “We’re so sorry to hear about this!” Bumble wrote. “We’ve found the member and permanently removed them.” In a follow-up video, Jocelyn added that she tried looking up Myles’ number, per a suggestion someone wrote in the comments, and couldn’t find it or its service provider online. She claimed this could mean he had been using a separate app to send her texts. Fake dating app profiles are not exactly rare — a 2019 study found that around 10% of dating profiles are fake. Unfortunately, it seemed like many commenters had similar stories to Jocelyn’s. “This happened to me too,” a commenter wrote. “I almost drove two hours to see him but something in my gut told me there was something off.” Watch this tiny bedroom get an organization overhaul in just one day: The post Woman catches Bumble catfish after seeing his texts appeared first on In The Know.

Asked about this on Friday, Zakharova began with a veiled warning. In translated remarks at a press conference, she said: ""The Finnish government's policy of military non-alliance is an important factor in ensuring security and stability in northern Europe.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's attire during his Thursday war declaration suggests his speech may have been pretaped. In a video that aired early Thursday in Russia, Putin said he would launch a ""special military action"" against Ukraine. During a televised address on Monday, Putin appeared to wear the same outfit as he denounced Ukraine's sovereignty, argued that Ukraine was a creation of the Soviet Union, and announced military intervention in eastern Ukraine. In both videos, Putin appeared to be sitting in the same spot at the same table, wearing the same outfit: a black blazer with a white dress shirt and a maroon tie. Multiple Ukrainian cities were hit by shelling after Russian President Vladmir Putin announced a full-scale military invasion. Emergency workers evacuated injured people from damaged apartment buildings. The similar attire and location prompted speculation that the declaration of a military assault against Ukraine had been taped earlier. Some analysts cited metadata from an official video as evidence that the address was pretaped. However, Aric Toler, an analyst with the publication Bellingcat, said that this was based on data from a different video and that the Kremlin video's data showed a creation date of February 24, leaving it unclear when the video was filmed. Other elements of Russia's actions on Ukraine have been scrutinized over apparent timing discrepancies. Documents from separatist leaders in Luhansk and Donetsk requesting aid from Russia made public on Wednesday bore signatures from the day before. The Kremlin also acknowledged that a dramatic Security Council meeting in Moscow this week about deciding whether to recognize the separatist regions as independent states had been recorded five hours before it was broadcast. At an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council late on Wednesday, Ukraine's ambassador to the UN, Sergiy Kyslytsya, delivered a searing response to Putin's action. ""About 48 minutes ago, your president declared war on Ukraine,"" Kyslytsya said to Russia's ambassador, Vasily Nebenzya.

2/26/2022,"By Luc Cohen NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - A new prosecutor has been chosen to lead a criminal probe into former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Manhattan district attorney's office said on Friday, after the departures of two top lawyers threw the investigation's future into question. Susan Hoffinger will now lead the probe into Trump and the practices of his family business, the Trump Organization, according to Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney. This week Special Counsel Carey Dunne and Mark Pomerantz - who had been leading the probe begun by former District Attorney Cyrus Vance - resigned. The New York Times reported they left after Bragg indicated to them he had doubts about pursuing a case against Trump. Reuters has not been able to reach Dunne or Pomerantz for comment. Ron Fischetti, a lawyer for Trump, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hoffinger's appointment. On Wednesday, Fischetti said the departures indicated ""the case is over"" and that Bragg would not bring charges against Trump. Both Bragg's probe and a separate civil investigation by New York State Attorney General Letitia James focus on whether Trump misrepresented the value of his real estate properties. Investigators are looking into whether values were inflated to obtain bank loans and reduced to lower tax bills. Trump, a Republican who left office in January 2021, has previously denied wrongdoing and said both the state and city investigations were politically motivated. He has not ruled out seeking the presidency again in 2024. Both Bragg and James are Democrats, as is Vance, who did not seek re-election. The criminal probe resulted last July in tax fraud charges against the Trump Organization and its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. Both Weisselberg and the company pleaded not guilty. Neither the Trump Organization nor its lawyer Alan Futerfas immediately responded to requests for comment. Last week, a state judge overseeing James' probe directed Trump and two of his adult children, Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump, to answer questions under oath in depositions. The Trump family will appeal that ruling, their lawyer said. James said on Friday that the appeal would not affect her team's investigation. ""Make no mistake: My office will continue to pursue this case without fear or favor because no one is above the law,"" James said in a statement. Hoffinger worked at a private law firm focusing on criminal defense before joining Bragg's office as executive assistant district attorney and chief of investigations in February, according to her LinkedIn profile. She had previously served in the Manhattan District Attorney's office in the 1990s.
