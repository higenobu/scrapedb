5/21/2022,"I readily identified with Owen Jones’s important article (Why homophobia against straight men matters, 17 May). Though the memories are decades old now – I went to a Catholic boys’ grammar school in Liverpool from 1976 to 1983 – the homophobic abuse I received is still very clear in my mind. While the school I went to wasn’t “rough”, a lot of the lads were still “hard”. I wasn’t. I was just different, in the way I looked and spoke. I am not gay, but that didn’t matter. My classmates rewarded my difference with a daily diet of homophobic insults. The masculine examples I had grown up with showed a different view of what it was “to be a man”. That is, being kind, gentle, caring, sharing household duties, very involved with bringing up the kids, and not spending hours in the pub. My dad was also something of a counsellor to his friends: “ordinary” blokes who, I later found out, would confide to him problems that were taboo at the time, eg erectile dysfunction. Sadly, he died when I was 12. I didn’t really have any friends at school until I was 16. I had hard-won respect from my peers, but at some cost. I still detest all-male, macho and misogynistic attitudes and environments. I often prefer talking to women than men (though I have good male friends). I also appear an ordinary bloke: married with two kids. I firmly believe that being an ordinary bloke can and should encompass the qualities my dad showed me. And I have never mastered the simian stroll.John GoughCoventry  I’ve been subject to comments of the type noted in Owen Jones’s article my whole adult life (I’m 57). In writing to you, my first impulse is to perhaps explain why people might think that I’m gay – but why should I have to explain myself? For me and for my experiences, the line “it is principally about policing the boundaries of masculinity” really strikes a chord. But I flatly refuse to let one narrow group of men be the guardians of what “being a man” is. Men who love men, men who have sex with men, are masculine men as far as I’m concerned. I can’t change the world by myself, but my act of defiance in the face of this mindless homophobia is to never tell people that I’m actually straight.Trevor SmeatonDormansland, Surrey  Thanks for Owen Jones’s important article on homophobic bullying of straight men. I think he is spot-on in his conclusion that it is a form of policing what masculinity is allowed to be. My daughter recently told me of the ribbing of a straight male school student in her cohort for studying dance and drama. She is 17. I would rather have hoped we would have moved on from this narrow view of what a boy or man is or can do. She sympathised with him because she was called a “lesbian” for being part of a women’s football team. Surely it is a sign that there is still so much to do to have LGBTQ people accepted in mainstream society that they are being used as sticks to beat straight people into conformity.Name and address supplied  I agree with Owen Jones. His piece shines a light on how homophobia is a very serious hate crime and should be understood at every level of society for what it really is, affecting as it does gays, straights and people from ethnic minorities. I know it can only be tackled by education within schools and universities. It should be a big part of sexual education in general for all ages into adulthood. I experienced this form of bullying at school, which made me hide my real sexuality until I reached my mid-50s. Unfortunately, I was the subject of homophobic hate in Notting Hill a few months back, which was both abusive and violent. I’m 73, so you see how serious this problem is. The police do take these matters seriously and arrested the man.

5/21/2022,"With regard to Peter Tatchell’s article (No thanks, Ma’am. For LGBT campaigners like me, your jubilee is nothing to celebrate, 15 May), perhaps it can be suggested to Mr Tatchell that republicanism has, historically as well as now, never gained ground in the UK and that republican nations are just as guilty – if not more so – of many of the things that Mr Tatchell accuses the monarchy of. The monarchy in the UK is immensely popular, albeit with a small core of detractors. The monarchy may be drawn from a “small circle” of society, but the US presidency is no less guilty of such a charge. Slavery and war? Were not some of the early US presidents themselves slaveowners, with Thomas Jefferson fathering children by an enslaved black woman? The US still has a far worse race relations record than the UK. Did republican France not have an empire? Yes, it did, with Vietnam still recovering from that period, which included war with France and the US. France still struggles with its treatment of the Algerian Harkis. Is not republican Russia now engaged in an awful war in Ukraine, a war with little logical basis? As such, Mr Tatchell’s somewhat caustic view of the royal family is out of kilter with established fact. War, slavery and lack of social mobility are not limited to monarchical nations. Perhaps Mr Tatchell should read the writings of Sunder Katwala, a former republican turned monarchist.Ian RobertsVice-chair, British Monarchist League  It appears that Peter Tatchell is unaware that, as long ago as 2006, the Oxford Friend Lesbian and Gay Helpline – we had yet formally to include trans people among the groups with whom we worked – was awarded the Queen’s award for voluntary service by groups in the community. It seemed like a landmark at the time, and I believe that we were the first LGBT group in the country to be thus recognised. The award, and its presentation at Oxford town hall, were widely reported in the local press.Harry DickinsonOxford  I applaud Peter Tatchell for not succumbing to the “monarchy machine”, resisting the seduction and sycophancy, and sticking to his republicanism, unlike other critics who are drawn in by the dubious honour system. Polls show that there are about 25% of us who support a republic and a good percentage who are indifferent to the monarchy. These numbers will grow when the Queen goes.Jenny BushellWimbledon, London  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/21/2022,"Thank you for the heartening piece by Michael Morpurgo (‘My spelling isn’t that great’, 18 May). When I started teaching English in 1971, we were free from restrictions on how to do it, so it was enjoyable, creative and challenging. The rot started to set in with Kenneth Baker’s prescriptive national curriculum in 1989, which prompted me to leave classroom English teaching. I pity those who remain, forced to follow Michael Gove’s even worse impositions on our young learners. Morpurgo’s analysis reminds me of a criticism of that approach to testing: “You don’t fatten a pig by weighing it.”Alasdair DonaldsonMaidenhead, Berkshire  Michael Morpurgo is spot-on. Our nine-year-old granddaughter is expected to know grammatical terms I never came across at grammar school in the 60s. If the Conservatives have any education policy at all, it is to replace it in state schools with mere instruction. Another example: at primary school in the 50s we did division; for our children in the 70s and 80s it was sharing, which made so much more sense; now, for our grandchildren, it’s back to division. What does that say about our society?Joy WebbPenistone, South Yorkshire  Pass notes (Rebranding maths as numeracy? It doesn’t add up, 19 May), in making the case for better numeracy, perpetuates a frequent confusion of maths with arithmetic. The latter is about addition, subtraction, multiplication etc – all essential for numeracy. Maths is about the abstract science of numbers and does require some effort to master. As someone who did well at maths but failed O-level arithmetic, I can attest that the latter is not necessary to excel at the former.

5/21/2022,"The electric guitar played by Kurt Cobain in the Smells Like Teen Spirit music video will be put up for sale this weekend by Julien’s Auctions. Speaking about the 1969 Fender Mustang during his final interview with Guitar World, Cobain said: “I’m left-handed, and it’s not very easy to find reasonably priced, high-quality left-handed guitars. But out of all the guitars in the whole world, the Fender Mustang is my favorite. I’ve only owned two of them.” The starting estimate is $600,000 to $800,000. It is currently on display in Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture where it has been for the past 12 years. Smells Like Teen Spirit is considered the seminal Generation X song – as NPR’s Joel Rose wrote, “an anthem for a generation that didn’t want one” . Released in 1991, its instantly recognizable guitar riff served as a bridge that transitioned mainstream pop music from the “hairband” era of the 1980s into the “alternative” grunge era of the early 1990s. “Smells Like Teen Spirit is an unusual anthem because it refuses the role of the anthem,” said NPR music critic Ann Powers. “It’s perfect for the generation it represented because this was a cohort that was so ambivalent about any traditional values [or] conventional success.” It got its name after Cobain’s girlfriend Tobi Vail’s bandmate in Bikini Kill, Kathleen Hanna, who had been laughing together at the deodorant brand Teen Spirit (“I mean, who names a deodorant Teen Spirit? What does teen spirit smell like? Like a locker room? Like pot mixed with sweat? Like the smell when you throw up in your hair at a party?” she told Double J) was drunkenly wrecking Cobain’s apartment for fun and wrote “Kurt smells like Teen Spirit” in Sharpie on the wall. “I took that as a compliment,” he said. After Cobain and Vail broke up, he told Rolling Stone, he set out to write “the ultimate pop song”, reportedly hoping to call it Anthem, though Vail pointed out that Bikini Kill already had a song with that name. The result, he said, was a riff that was deliberately “cliched” and, he felt, too similar to Boston’s More Than a Feeling: the band did not want it to be the album’s first single but were overruled. The video, shot on a soundstage in Culver City, California, features bored and distraught students sitting on bleachers, cheerleaders wearing the anarchy symbol and head-banging teenagers that eventually end up “tearing the place to shreds,” as Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl described it. The band had handed out flyers to their audience at the Roxy in West Hollywood two days before the shoot, asking everyone to show up for the video. The destruction at the end of the video, following a 12-hour day, was reportedly real. Cobain himself hated the attention the song received. “Everyone has focused on that song so much,” he told Rolling Stone. “The reason it gets a big reaction is people have seen it on MTV a million times. It’s been pounded into their brains.” Other items that will be on auction this weekend include Cobain’s 1965 Dodge Dart 170 four-door sedan. According to Julien’s Auctions, it is the “only known surviving car that was owned and driven” by Cobain. The car, nicknamed Baby Blue, is conservatively estimated at $400,000 to $600,000. An NFT of the green Fetalini striped short-sleeve sweater that Cobain wore in the video is also up for auction, with an estimated value of $6,000 to $8,000. The auction house said Kurt gave the actual sweater to his mother. A portion of the proceeds will go to Kicking the Stigma, a national initiative by the American football team Indianapolis Colts and their owner, Jim Irsay. The funds will be used to “raise awareness about mental health disorders and to remove the stigma too often associated with these illnesses”.",Arts/Music,Kurt Cobain’s Smells Like Teen Spirit electric guitar to be auctioned,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/may/20/kurt-cobain-guitar-auction
5/21/2022,"To dismiss the Metropolitan police investigation into Downing Street’s lockdown gatherings as a waste of time, as rightwing newspapers did on Friday, is grotesque. No police inquiry that resulted in 126 fines on 83 individuals from a single workplace for Covid breaches in a country in which more than 178,000 people have died from the virus should be described in that contemptuous way. No investigation that established widespread rule-breaking at the heart of government, where those very Covid rules were made, deserves to be brushed aside as entirely pointless, as the Daily Mail did. Yet the Met’s Operation Hillman inquiry was in many ways a sorry affair. It was a mistake not to investigate the parties much earlier. It was humiliating to then do a U-turn and launch an investigation under political and media pressure. It was foolish to apply rules of process that suggested special treatment for politicians. It was a misjudgment to suspend the operation during the local elections. It was wrong to wrap the whole exercise in so much secrecy. All this, though, was of a piece with many other inconsistencies in the way that the pandemic was policed around Britain. Most of the response to Operation Hillman has focused on the implications for politics. But what about the implications for policing? The handling of the Downing Street breaches has done further damage to the credibility of a force that is already reeling from other recent scandals about race and sex. The Downing Street investigation has managed to offend almost everyone in some way, on the right as well as the left, in the civil service and the media as well as the Tory party, and above all among those who were bereaved by Covid. The police should be deeply concerned about this almost unanimous verdict. One particularly troubling suspicion from the Partygate inquiry is that police felt intimidated by the possible consequences of what they were looking into. In theory, Britain’s police are operationally independent. But it didn’t always feel that way during the past few months, including this week. Downing Street, after all, is the place where they have the final say on police spending, police numbers and police structures. The Met commissioner’s job is also currently vacant and the force leaderless. These will have been difficult factors to ignore absolutely. All this may be dismissed as speculative, but there is wider evidence that police accountability in Britain is not working as well as it should be. The state of policing report issued by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services in March states that “too many chief constables” currently lack confidence in the resilience of the boundary between political accountability and operational independence. In parts of the country, the report says, there is “an atmosphere of mistrust and fear” among police chiefs. In the worst cases, police efficiency and effectiveness have suffered and police leaders have been reluctant to put their heads above the parapet. Such a process may have applied in Operation Hillman too. The system of police accountability in England and Wales – to elected police and crime commissioners as well as some mayors – is a decade old this year. It has not been a success. Turnout for the elections is derisory. The elections put too much power in the hands of one person, and there have been some bad breakdowns in trust. London’s experience has been particularly turbulent, but it is not unique. Police operational independence ought to be a crucial defence for the public against the development of a police state. The current accountability system makes it harder to uphold and produces poorer outcomes. When no one is satisfied with a system, it is surely time to change it.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on the Partygate investigation: blame the system,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/20/the-guardian-view-on-the-partygate-investigation-blame-the-system
5/21/2022,"Mamma mia, here we go again, except this time it will be different. Abba will be back on stage next Friday to promote their reunion album, Voyage, with a stadium show that circumvents all the old jokes about rock dinosaurs by using cutting-edge holographic technology to capture them singing the songs, while retro-styling them to look as they did in their 1970s heyday. So they won’t actually be there at all. The production team behind this show breathlessly exclaimed that five weeks of filming was enough to capture the “soul” of Abba. A mixed reception for the album itself will not prevent the faithful from flocking to the custom-built stadium in east London for the six-month run, where their avatars will perform alongside a live band. Ever since they won the 1974 Eurovision song contest with Waterloo, Abba have been critic-proof. “No thank you for the music” is how the Guardian received their latest album. But everybody knows Abba’s tunes. The jukebox musical Mamma Mia! is the West End’s sixth longest-running show, and the film based on it remains the 20th highest-grossing film at the UK box office. Those who believe that the Voyage concerts will set a new precedent should take some heed of earlier attempts to do so. Dave Clark’s West End musical Time, in 1986, fatuously brought Sir Laurence Olivier back to the stage as a 14-foot high hologram. Until such time as someone attempted to reconstruct the Alps for a rock musical about Heidi, opined the New York Times, this was musical theatre’s “most sensational contrast between mountainous spectacle and molehill content”. But times have changed, and Abba, always so good at capturing the zeitgeist, may yet have done it again. The last two years have accelerated the move towards a hybrid culture that was already happening with cinema screenings of live shows. In terms of technology, it was a period of such rapid innovation that the pre-pandemic idea of recording an opera, ballet or play by sticking a couple of fixed cameras in front of the stage seems like prehistory. Experiments such as the livestreamed concert that Dua Lipa trialled back in 2020 don’t always work, but it would be a shame if they were abandoned. The move towards virtual “live” events chimes with evolving ideas of personal risk and the carbon economy. The four Abba members are now in their 70s. They and their entourages won’t be racking up air miles or exposing themselves nightly to new viral variants. For all the sequins and spectacle, there will only be 10 musicians on stage at the Abba stadium. And for 1970s nostalgists eager for a more embodied entertainment, there will always be Elton John. Voyage may turn out to be an innovative dead end, but its real value is as a reminder that a live show is a communal event, which draws its energy from the desire of people in the room to have a good time together. It will be a blast for their many fans to strap on those dancing shoes again, with a quartet of pop idols who will never age.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Abba: still rocking the room 40 years on | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/20/the-guardian-view-on-abba-still-rocking-the-room-40-years-on
5/21/2022,"Junior civil servants who did not want to attend lockdown-breaching parties held at 10 Downing Street risked being forced to take legal action and put their careers in jeopardy, a senior employment lawyer has said. The law expects people to stand up for themselves, experts have said, with employees largely expected to comply with their bosses. Whistleblowing legislation is rarely used because people are worried about repercussions. “You’re going to struggle as an employee to effectively have any protection against doing what your boss asks you to do unless it is unpleasant, discriminatory or illegal,” said Kathryn Evans, a partner and the head of employment law at Trethowans Solicitors. “But even if there is a legal breach, as in the case of these parties, the employee needs to decide whether to refuse and risk damaging their relationship with their boss. If they fear this might happen, they have no choice but to bring legal proceedings, which means being prepared to stand up and be counted – and accept that their relationship with their boss is probably at an end.” Philip Landau, a partner at Landau Law, agreed. “Deferring to their boss’s interpretation of the rules – even though those bosses wrote the rules – is not a plausible and credible defence. “If your boss puts you in the position where you feel you need to attend a party or lose their favour, there is actually no elegant or subtle way out of it,” he said. “If you feel exposed in this way, you may need to lodge a grievance to protect your position and if this doesn’t resolve matters, bring a case for constructive dismissal. This does mean resigning from your position, however.” Rustom Tata, a partner and chair at law firm DMH Stallard, said the “law expects people to be able to stand up for themselves. That’s really tough on employees but the situation here is whether they broke the law or they didn’t. Whether you knew it was the law or why you broke it is irrelevant.” But, said Tata, one of the general principles of employment law is that everybody should be subjected to an appropriate penalty. This, he pointed out, is said not to have happened in the case of the lockdown parties, where women and Downing Street staffers on low salaries have reportedly been disproportionately hit by fines. “Given that no police interviews took place and this all rested on questionnaires, if somebody junior is receiving a fixed-penalty notice for being honest about what they did, compared to somebody senior to them who doesn’t get fined, that isn’t fair,” said Tata. The question then is what the junior employee can do about it. “This is where it becomes very hard,” said Tata. “The junior employee doesn’t know who they’ve got beef with: is it their boss, who didn’t fill the form out honestly, or is it with the police for selective prosecution?” But Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the trade union representing professionals and managers in public service, said junior civil servants may have attended the parties through choice – and senior civil servants may have been fined. “Clearly this is a unique environment where a relatively junior civil servant could be invited to something by some of the most senior people in the country but let’s not forget, there were civil servants who chose not to attend these parties,” he said. “We also don’t know who has been fined,” he added. “Junior civil servants might think they’re the only ones but because there’s no obligation to report it if you’ve received a fine, we don’t know who actually has.”",News/Law,"Junior staff could have risked career by not attending No 10 parties, lawyer says",https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/may/20/junior-staff-could-risked-career-not-attending-no-10-parties-lawyer-says
5/21/2022,"Boris Johnson said: “My experience of working from home is you spend an awful lot of time making another cup of coffee and then, you know, getting up, walking very slowly to the fridge, hacking off a small piece of cheese, then walking very slowly back to your laptop and then forgetting what it was you’re doing.” This says far more about him than about anything else. What it says is that he is a useless idler who’s never done an honest day’s work in his life. I started working from home in 2012, when the company I was working for closed its London office. The extra time I had in the morning without having to commute meant I had a better night’s sleep, so when I sat at my desk at 9am and began work, I was better rested and refreshed. I could log on and get right down to my work without any distractions. As did my colleagues, whom I communicated with through email and Skype. During the pandemic, everyone I know was working from home, and doing just as much work as if they’d been sitting in the office. What this is all really about is Tory donors getting worried about the value of their property portfolios.Antony J ShepherdCroydon, London  Boris Johnson’s description of his home-working behaviour, referred to by Gaby Hinsliff (Remote working is making the UK a more equal place – however much Jacob Rees-Mogg may sneer, 15 May), is at odds with my research findings. On Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, translated it to be less cheesy as “people’s concentration … isn’t as focused perhaps at home than it would be at work”. But employees typically report precisely the opposite: that they are more focused working at home, not least as they get fewer interruptions. At home they may develop more of a rhythm to their workflow, focus more on priorities and give more in-depth consideration to tasks, and thus improve the quality of their work. This will not, however, necessarily amount to increased productivity, as people may be working longer hours to complete the same amount of work. This illustrates that the issue of the productiveness of home working goes far beyond the prime minister’s fear of “forgetting what it was you’re doing”. Moreover, the valid argument which Hinsliff draws attention to – that going to the workplace is vital for sharing experiences and developing ideas – adds to the complexity, as it means we must differentiate short-term and long-term performance effects.Prof Stephen WoodUniversity of Leicester  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

5/21/2022,"Following the announcement that Britain’s Laura Robson has retired from tennis at the age of 28 after three hip operations (Report, 16 May), I feel that a review of the sport and its impact on the long-term health of participants is overdue. Laura joins a long list of players who have had surgery at what is a relatively young age (Andy Murray, hip; Roger Federer, knee; Serena Williams, knee; Rafael Nadal, ankle). Procedures such as hip replacements only last about 15 years, so former players will probably face further surgery, not to mention the likelihood of suffering with arthritis in old age. Tennis involves a lot of pivoting and twisting, which is hard on the hips; there may be more hip and lower leg injuries due to the increased time spent rallying in the modern game, which seems to have moved away from the serve-and-volley game of previous eras. As a result, matches last considerably longer in what is already a lengthier playing season. Playing surfaces are also considerably harder, which adds to the impact on joints. Surely the time has come for changes to the game. Let’s get back to the serve-and-volley game: it is much more exciting to watch.

5/21/2022,"A former NHS nurse has been brought in to bring order and discipline to the chaos of Boris Johnson’s faltering Downing Street machine. Samantha Jones, 50, became No 10’s first chief operating officer in February as part of the prime minister’s revamp of his team. Just how powerful her role would be emerged this week. The existing No 10 operation, alongside teams in the Cabinet Office supporting Johnson and his top table of ministers, will be in a group led by her. Her rank of permanent secretary is the second most senior official at the centre of government under the cabinet secretary, Simon Case. But amid whispers that Case has been damaged by the Partygate revelations – many civil servants under him were fined and he was present at more than one of the events investigated by Scotland Yard – she seems to have been handed a large chunk of the cabinet secretary’s former responsibilities. It is a rare and steep rise in Whitehall to the very top of the civil service for someone outside the usual route followed by top mandarins. Most of her colleagues of similar rank will have been fast tracked through Oxbridge and the senior ranks of major government departments. Jones worked her way through the NHS to become the chief executive of two hospital trusts. She has only been working in Downing Street since last April. She was appointed as the prime minister’s top adviser on NHS transformation and social care. She began her career as a nurse at Great Ormond Street Hospital for children in London but rapidly moved into management, taking part in the NHS’s two-year graduate management training scheme. In an interview, she said: “I said, ‘I don’t know why I want to be a manager, but I’ve got four brothers. I’m too stroppy. I have to stand by my beds while the consultant does his ward round and I’m not allowed to speak until I’m spoken to — and I’m not having any of that.’ ” Jones became the chief executive of Epsom and St Helier NHS trust and later the West Hertfordshire hospitals NHS trust, and was one of the youngest chief executives in England. She also worked as a director of care strategies at NHS England. She entered Downing Street after working in the private sector. She became CEO in the UK of Centene, part of a US private health group, which recently became one of the largest primary care providers in England, with 58 practices and more than 500,000 patients. Her subsequent re entry into the public sector led some to believe she was being lined up for last year’s vacant CEO position of NHS England but in the end the job went to another high NHS flyer, Amanda Pritchard. Whitehall insiders hope that her management skills will be useful in assessing whether the structure of Downing Street is as effective as it should be. A mother of twins, she once said her favourite books include Machiavelli’s The Prince, while her dream dinner party guests would include Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, David Walliams and Nelson Mandela.",News/Politics,Samantha Jones: the former NHS nurse asked to bring order to No 10,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/20/samantha-jones-boris-johnson-downing-street-partygate
5/21/2022,"As a straight return on investment, it’s hard to beat “Untitled”, a 1982 work by Jean-Michel Basquiat, the African American street artist who became a global cultural icon, featuring a horned African mask on an abstract background across a canvas almost 5m wide. In 2004, the painting sold for $4.5m. Back on the market 12 years later, it fetched $57.3m, then a record for a Basquiat. This week, it went under the hammer in New York for $85m (£68m), including fees, to a buyer from Asia. The Basquiat sale comes amid extraordinary sums paid for artworks. Shot Sage Blue Marilyn by Andy Warhol – Basquiat’s rival and sometime friend – sold for a staggering $195m earlier this month, and three paintings by Pablo Picasso, Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne fetched a total of almost $166m on Tuesday. The second sale this week of works in the Macklowe collection – a court-ordered auction as part of an acrimonious divorce settlement between octogenarians Harry and Linda Macklowe – realised $246m. Total sales from the couple’s remarkable collection, which included works by Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko, came to more than $922m. Another stellar collection of 12 works, including Monet’s Le Parlement, soleil couchant, that belonged to the late Anne Bass brought in $363m last week. Sales of impressionist, modern, postwar and contemporary art at the main New York auction houses – Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips – have raised more than $2bn this month, reported art market research company ArtTactic. Sotheby’s New York sales topped $1bn this week alone, with strong activity from Asia and online. At a time of geopolitical uncertainty, soaring inflation and falling stock prices, the art market is beyond booming. The explosion is fuelled by a combination of an unusual number of highly desirable works becoming available, and an increase in those who can afford to buy them. “The rich have got much richer,” said art market specialist and author Georgina Adam, pointing to Forbes’ tally of more than 700 new billionaires across the world in the past couple of years. “And if you’re mega-rich, there aren’t that many things you can acquire that are real trophies, that nobody else can have. Art is a real trophy.” Anders Petterson, ArtTactic’s founder, said there was also an investment element to acquisitions by ultra-high net worth individuals. “After the financial crisis [in 2008], we saw people wanting to put their money into tangible assets. We’re seeing an element of that again now.” Art was “seen as somewhere safe to put your money,” said Adam. “At the top end of the market, the returns can be colossal. What other investment can offer these sorts of returns?” The demographic profile of buyers is changing. Almost a quarter of the total bid value for works from the Macklowe collection came from Asia. Monet’s Les Arceaux des Roses was sold this week by Sotheby’s to an Asian buyer for $23.3m. The auction house has also seen record-high participation from young and new collectors. “It’s really pronounced – and they’re not only buying cutting edge, contemporary works but also established works,” said Brooke Lampley, chairman and worldwide head of sales for global fine art at Sotheby’s. The other half of the equation was supply, she said. “During the pandemic, there was a dearth of works to sell because of uncertainty about the resilience of the market. A lot of people chose to wait. “This season, we’re seeing the first real return to pre-pandemic supply levels, and a variety of consignors electing to sell great works of art. And that has attracted a strong and healthy demand.” The market is also becoming more accessible, thanks to online auctions. This week, for the first time, Sotheby’s broadcast live on Instagram its sale of modern art, attracting nearly 20,000 viewers. Auction houses, which were forced online at the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in March 2020, have embraced digital platforms such as TikTok, Facebook Live and YouTube. “It has opened channels to a whole new demographic,” said Petterson. The only way to witness an art auction in the past was to brave an exclusive, highly privileged and often intimidating group. “Now you can sit in front of your screen at home to watch this theatrical spectacle. It definitely drives interest.” Whether the current spate of blockbuster sales continues remains to be seen. “So much is driven by exceptional works of art coming to market,” said Lampley. “If that continues next season, then I expect the market will show up for it. But if the unusually plentiful supply this season withers, we might see a different reaction.” Other factors could come into play, said Petterson. “Confidence in the market is really high, but we have to be careful not to think it’s immune to what’s happening elsewhere in the world. “We’re going into a period where people are suffering in terms of food on the table, the price of electricity and gas. There might come a point where it becomes difficult to justify paying these prices.”",Arts/Art and design,‘The rich have got much richer’: why art sale prices are going through the roof,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/20/the-rich-have-got-much-richer-why-art-sale-prices-are-going-through-the-roof
5/21/2022,"My daughter, Elizabeth Rose, who has died aged 33 from the effects of Crohn’s disease, was a talented artist and curator and disability advocate who documented her illness on social media. Elizabeth developed Crohn’s in her teenage years and thereafter led an extraordinary artistic life, despite the steady progression of the disease, which led to the complete loss of a functioning digestive system. She was born Elizabeth Rose Cockram in Brisbane, Australia, to Christine (nee Flowers), a florist, and me, an engineer by trade. At the time when Lizzy, our third child, was born we were running a hydroponic rose farm. When Christine and I separated in 1992, when Lizzy was four, she moved to the UK with her mother and was subsequently renamed Elizabeth Rose. Lizzy attended Simon Langton girls’ grammar school at Canterbury, Kent, and studied fine art at Central Saint Martins, London. She had an interest in film from a young age, supported and encouraged by her stepfather, Billy Luck. While studying she further developed that interest, using film and photography as artistic media. She graduated with a first in 2010. After university she worked as a gallery assistant at the Turner Contemporary in Margate, Kent. From 2012 to 2015 she worked with Limbo arts in Margate as assistant curator. In 2016 she toured Japan to study trends in Japanese art, and became part of the programming team at the Crate gallery, Margate, where her audiovisual installation, Arrangement, inspired by Japanese floristry, was exhibited in 2018. The same year she became an associate at Open School East art school in London. A significant event in Lizzy’s life was her high court challenge in 2014 to secure egg-harvesting facilities before a bone-marrow procedure that would render her sterile. Although the case was denied, it resulted in recommendations by the judge on funding that would improve outcomes for patients in a similar position, and to that extent was a leap forward. Lizzy was highly intelligent and resourceful, and communicated widely through social media. Her posts during the final years of her life were touching and inspiring. She endured the suffering of her disease with great strength, posting on Instagram as @lizzyrosequartz with humour and humanity. When she died she was waiting for a small bowel transplant. She is survived by her mother and me, and by her brothers, Richard and John. Her stepfather, Bill, died in January.",Arts/Art and design,Elizabeth Rose obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/20/elizabeth-rose-obituary
5/21/2022,"A police officer involved in the arrest of Sheku Bayoh has told the inquiry into his death in custody that he heard one of Bayoh’s ribs break as he attempted to resuscitate him. PC Craig Walker, who the inquiry heard weighed 25st (158kg) at the time of the incident in Kirkcaldy in May 2015, said he performed CPR after he and two other officers who were trying to restrain Bayoh on the ground realised that he was unconscious. Walker also said a list of descriptive terms used by fellow officers about Bayoh – including “deranged with superhuman strength” – amounted to “perception”. He said he was unaware of stereotyping relating to black men and criminal justice. After insisting he had not encountered any examples of racial discrimination or racist jokes or comments among colleagues, Walker was asked by Claire Mitchell QC, acting for the Bayoh family, whether comments such as “the biggest male I have seen” amounted to racial stereotyping. Walker, the first officer involved in Bayoh’s arrest to appear at the inquiry, replied: “They could be referring to a muscular build. If someone was to say that to me, that would be their judgment.” The inquiry heard that Walker and the former PC Alan Paton – the first officers to respond to calls from the public about a man brandishing a knife and behaving erratically early on a Sunday morning – were both 6ft 4ins in height, compared with Bayoh’s 5ft 10ins. Bayoh’s family campaigned for years for an independent inquiry into his death, which they believe was caused by positional asphyxia because of the tactics used by police. They allege officers overreacted and were motivated by racial bias. Angela Grahame QC, the inquiry’s senior counsel, asked Walker about how he, Paton and another officer restrained Bayoh on the pavement. She asked: “At any stage did you lie on Sheku Bayoh?” Walker replied: “I think as part of having to reach across him, the upper part of my body was on his shoulder.” He said the 31-year-old was not flat on his front because his left arm remained underneath him. The restraint began, he said, after he witnessed Bayoh make a “full-force stamp” on another officer, PC Nicole Short. Walker confirmed that “when we turned up he wasn’t actively in possession of the knife, or brandishing it.” Asked what role race played in the assumptions and choices that were made by police that morning, Walker said he “didn’t make any assumptions”, and that all decisions were “based on the threat he posed to ourselves and members of the public”. The public inquiry, under Lord Bracadale, continues.",News/UK news,Sheku Bayoh officer says he heard rib break as he attempted resuscitation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/20/sheku-bayoh-officer-says-he-heard-rib-break-as-he-attempted-resuscitation
5/21/2022,"Formula One opened the European leg of the season in sweltering temperatures and an appropriately heated and fractious atmosphere in the paddock. Fernando Alonso launched a scathing attack on the FIA, the sport’s governing body, for which he faces a potential punishment, while Red Bull in turn expressed scorn and disbelief at Aston Martin, who were accused of copying the design of their car. Before practice had even begun at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya the brickbats were flying. Aston Martin, who have been off the pace all season, wheeled out the updated version of their AMR22 car which bore a striking resemblance to the mightily quick Red Bull RB18, with which Max Verstappen has already won three races this season. At the end of last year, two senior aerodynamicists, Dan Fallows and Andrew Alessi, left Red Bull to join Aston Martin and the Red Bull Team principal, Christian Horner, noted his “grave concern” that Red Bull’s intellectual property may have been compromised. “It is quite a thing to instruct your team to come up with a very close-looking clone of our car and, of course, a few people have moved over the winter period, and what you can’t control is what they take in their heads,” he said. The Aston Martin has already been dubbed the “green Red Bull” and Red Bull’s pit-wall team were pointedly sat with the green version of the drink at their work stations during practice. Aston Martin have form in this department. When the team were Racing Point in 2020, they used photographs to mimic the design of the title-winning Mercedes of 2019, after which the FIA banned teams from copying rival designs. The FIA issued a statement on Friday announcing they had concluded a legality investigation into the Aston Martin, with both teams involved, and ruled no wrongdoing had been committed and that it was not a result of reverse engineering or of an illegal transfer of intellectual property (IP). But Red Bull were unwilling to let the matter lie. They issued a sceptical rebuke questioning the decision. Having noted the FIA’s statement “with interest”, the team added: “Should any transfer of IP have taken place that would clearly be a breach of regulations and would be a serious concern”. In a busy morning for the FIA, Alonso, the double world champion, accused it of incompetence. The Spaniard was given a five-second penalty at the last round in Miami for cutting a chicane – dropping the Alpine driver from a points-scoring position. He insisted he had then slowed to give the time he had gained back. “We believe it was very unfair and incompetence from the stewards,” said Alonso. “We arrived back with the proof and they were packing up, not even in the room. We showed them the data and they found themselves with their hands tied because they had already issued the penalty. “It was very bad. It is something that should not happen in F1.” The FIA has referred Alonso to the stewards for a potential punishment for his remarks. On the track the heat is also on for Mercedes. The team principal, Toto Wolff, had said that Barcelona would be the point at which the team considered whether they had made an error in their car design and would assess taking a new direction for next year’s model. They have reason for cautious optimism. Following a raft of upgrades to the floor of the car, the team appeared to enjoy a decrease in the porpoising that has plagued them this season. In so doing, Mercedes may have begun to unlock the pace they believe their car has in spades. In second practice they were right in the mix, with George Russell and Lewis Hamilton in second and third and within two tenths of title leader Charles Leclerc, who had led a Ferrari one-two in the morning session with his teammate Carlos Sainz.",Sport/Sport,Red Bull fume over ‘clone’ Aston Martin while Alonso rages at F1 stewards,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/may/20/red-bull-fume-over-clone-aston-martin-while-alonso-rages-at-f1-stewards
