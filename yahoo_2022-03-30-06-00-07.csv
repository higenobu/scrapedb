3/30/2022,"Hannah Choi of Fairfax County, Virginia, first reported missing on March 6, was found dead in nearby Charles County, Maryland, last Thursday, authorities confirmed at a press conference on Monday.

A passerby found Choi’s remains in a wooded area on the 1100 block of Overlook Drive in Accokeek, an area within Piscataway Park. They then called 911.

Joel Mosso Merino, 27, Choi’s ex-boyfriend, is believed to be responsible for her death. Fairfax police suspect Merino killed Choi in their shared Alexandria home after an argument.

Choi, 35, was last seen at home on March 5, police said. Friends came to see her the next day, but she did not answer the door.

Choi had already missed several appointments. Her friends decided to call the police, who then conducted a search and found that Choi and Merino were still at home on the evening of March 5.

A friend said Choi had broken up with Merino weeks before she went missing. On the night of her disappearance, police believe “something happened” between her and Merino and that she sustained “a significant injury.”

Police recovered the car that Merino had driven on the evening of March 5 in Washington, D.C., on March 8. A ticket revealed that he was also supposed to fly to California on the same day, but he never showed up to board his flight, police said.

Merino has been charged with second-degree murder and felony disposal of a body. His arrest warrant was served shortly after Choi’s disappearance.

Police on Monday also announced a $40,000 reward for information that will lead to his arrest. “Joel Merino is Fairfax County’s most wanted and he is on the run,” Maj. Ed O’Carroll told reporters.

Police said Merino was last seen in the Atlanta area, but “he can be anywhere.” They also believe he has changed his name.

Choi’s family recalled her as someone who always tried to help others. “We will always remember [Hannah] as someone who was brave, strong, independent and [as] someone who dedicated her life to helping others,” her sister, Minna, said at the conference.

Minna, along with six others, has organized a GoFundMe page to help their family. The campaign has raised about $53,000.

Anyone with information about Merino is urged to call Fairfax County police at 703-246-7800. Anonymous tips may also be submitted by calling 1-866-411-TIPS, texting “FCCS” plus tip to 847411 or filling this web form.

3/30/2022,"(Reuters) -A shell hit a temporary Russian military camp near the border with Ukraine late on Tuesday, Tass news agency said and cited a source as saying preliminary data showed it had been fired from the Ukrainian side. Tass issued the report shortly after a senior local official reported a series of explosions outside the city of Belgorod, close to the border with Ukraine. Video posted online from two local Belgorod news outlets appeared to show ammunition blowing up in the distance but Reuters was not immediately able to confirm this was the case. Tass cited an emergency services source as saying four people had been injured in the blast. Belgorod governor Vyacheslav Gladkov earlier said in an online post that the blasts occurred near the village of Krasny Oktyabr, about 30 km (19 miles) southwest of Belgorod. He did not give a reason for the blasts and promised an update later. Belgorod is 80 km (50 miles) north of the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv, which Russian forces have bombarded heavily in recent weeks.

3/30/2022,"Those sanctioned Russian assets are piling up. Oligarch yachts, estates, planes, and other items in the West may sit out of their owners' hands — but they are not yet necessarily in the control of Western governments. The rules vary across Europe where most of the seizures have taken place following Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The White House recently offered examples of assets that have been taken off the table and noted some had been seized while others were impounded. Under U.S. law, any sanctioned assets would be in a state of legal limbo and put aside, but could eventually be returned to their owners. Now policymakers in the U.S. — both on Capitol Hill and perhaps in the administration — are pushing to change the uncertain status of those assets around the world. Some want to not just take possession of the assets of Kremlin-connected billionaires, but also sell them and give the proceeds to Ukraine. As Senator Rob Portman (R OH) recently put it on the Senate floor, we should be expanding sanctions and “seizing, not just freezing, assets from Kremlin supporters” alongside other measures. Portman and Sen. Michael Bennet (D-CO) have introduced a bill, the RELIEF for Ukraine Act, which directs any funds from seized Russian assets towards Ukrainian refugees, reconstruction, and other efforts. President Joe Biden pledged to seize the ""ill-begotten gains"" of Russian oligarchs during his State of the Union Address on March 1. During a speech Tuesday in London, Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo outlined how the U.S. government and its allies may go further in sanctioning Russian individuals. Adeyemo, who's in Europe to shore up alliances, touted the work to “share information and intelligence and to facilitate the enforcement of our sanctions, namely to freeze and seize assets of sanctioned individuals.” “We have far further to go to fully address this threat and restore justice for the people of Ukraine,” Adeymo added, without saying where the assets could go. Adeyemo also noted that the West may sanction those who help Russian oligarchs hide their assets. The intentions of the bill from Portman and Bennet are clear: If enacted, it would create a new Ukraine Relief Fund administered by the Department of State. “Our bill makes Putin and Russian oligarchs pay the price by ensuring that funds from their seized assets go directly to the Ukrainian people to support them through many difficult years ahead of resettlement, reconstruction, and recovery,” Bennet said in a statement. To be sure, Ukraine could use the extra money. Ukraine’s economy minister, Yulia Svyrydenko, recently said the war in Ukraine has cost her country $564.9 billion by damaging infrastructure and hindering economic growth. However, the oligarchs may be able to easily compensate for those losses. An oft-cited 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research estimated Russian oligarch wealth and came to the startling conclusion that rich Russians held around $800 billion in assets outside of Russia, as of 2015. Or to put it more starkly: “There is as much financial wealth held by rich Russians abroad — in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Cyprus, and similar offshore centers — than held by the entire Russian population in Russia itself,” Filip Novokmet, Thomas Piketty, and Gabriel Zucman wrote. In the end, any action would likely take place under the umbrella of a recently formed multinational task force that includes the U.S. That would allow Western governments to work together to track and allocate the assets, which so far have been found largely in Europe.

3/30/2022,"Let the charm offensive begin as Frontier Airlines (ULCC) looks to seal the deal on its mega-merger with fellow low cost operator Spirit Airlines (SAVE). Part of that charm offensive will include the airlines tempering regulator concerns around potential future pricing for travelers should the businesses be combined. ""This merger will create a very large, low cost carrier with true nationwide capabilities and provide more low fares to more people and places. The facts just support that when left to our own devices, we actually have very low fares. So the idea that we would raise prices is just absurd. That would be like Walmart merging with a dollar store to raise prices. It's just not going to happen,"" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said on Yahoo Finance Live. Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines announced their $6.6 billion combination in February. If the two companies combine, the airline would be the fifth largest in the United States. It would mark the biggest major airlines deal since Alaska Airlines combined with Virgin America in 2016. The merger has already come across the radar screen of far left Democratic Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Both fear the removal of a competitor in the marketplace could send airfare prices higher. “For decades, the airline industry has been plagued by increasing consolidation, producing massive airline giants while leaving consumers and workers behind. Because the proposed Spirit-Frontier merger threatens to exacerbate these trends — including by potentially increasing prices during a period of high inflationary pressure — we urge the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) to closely review this mega merger for potential violations of the Clayton Act and for concerns under 49 U.S.C. § 41105 and to oppose it if you determine it will threaten competition in the airline industry or ‘the public interest,'"" Warren, Sanders and several other lawmakers send in a statement. Frontier's Biffle said he understands the concern of regulators, but this time is different. ""Look, I don't know that they are wrong. I think they are concerned on what has happened with past mergers, and we share that concern. That's why this merger is so important today because this is different than anything else we have had in the past,"" Biffle added. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
