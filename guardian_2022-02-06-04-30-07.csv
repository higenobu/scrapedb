2/6/2022,"A network of white supremacists, neo-Nazis and antisemites has celebrated Boris Johnson’s false claim that Keir Starmer failed to prosecute Jimmy Savile. Johnson was roundly criticised, including by some Tory MPs, after he made the accusation during an ill-tempered exchange in the Commons last Monday.  His accusation led to renewed calls for him to resign, prompted chancellor Rishi Sunak to publicly rebuke the prime minister and saw one of his closest aides, Munira Mirza, quit over her boss’s “scurrilous accusation” and subsequent failure to apologise. An Observer investigation can now reveal how Johnson’s comments have since been seized upon by notorious far-right groups including the Pie and Mash Squad, a network of football hooligans linked to the anti-Muslim English Defence League and violent Casuals United, as well as a white nationalist organisation called the Traditional Britain Group. Other rightwing British figures to appreciate Johnson’s intervention include neo-Nazi Mark Collett, who leads the white supremacist Patriotic Alternative group, as well as Nick Griffin, former leader of the fascist British National Party. The Savile accusation has long been touted among far-right groups, including the anti-immigrant neo-fascist Proud Boys, labelled a terrorist entity by Canada following its “pivotal role” in the US Capitol attack last year. Other infamous far-right figures to have endorsed the allegation that Starmer failed to prosecute Savile when he was director of public prosecutions include EDL founder Tommy Robinson. A statement from Tech Against Terrorism, an initiative launched by the UN counter-terrorism executive directorate, said the prime minister’s willingness to repeat discredited far-right tropes was disquieting. “We are gravely concerned by this recent example of extremist ideology manifesting in mainstream British politics,” it read. Meanwhile the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), an international group that seeks to disrupt online hate, said the episode was a striking instance of how social media amplified information that was probably untrue. Imran Ahmed, chief executive of CCDH, said: “It’s a very good example of disinformation that has benefitted from the specific amplifying dynamic of social media.” Johnson’s repeating of the Savile slur was celebrated instantly by the extreme right, with CCDH recording that posts on rightwing channels on the messaging app Telegram had attracted 42,521 views in the two days after Johnson made the remark. The prime minister’s comments also induced threats of violence with one account, whose avatar is a confederate flag, posting “hang the lot of them” in reference to Labour politicians on alt-tech platform Brand New Tube, while an anonymous poster on the 4Chan bulletin board suggested Starmer “should kill himself”. On Telegram, the Traditional Britain Group account, whose members have previously called for black people to return to their “natural homelands”, bemoaned the “synthetic outrage” around Johnson’s Savile comments. Neo-Nazi Mark Collett, who once suggested Hitler’s Mein Kampf as one of three books people should read and has attended combat training with former members of the proscribed terrorist organisation National Action, posted about the “establishment” and “paedophilia”, a longstanding far-right obsession. Another notorious figure to seize on Johnson’s comments was Mark Steele, a British conspiracy theorist with more than 20,000 Telegram channel subscribers, who posted: “Johnson ousts Keir the knight of the realm who blocked the police investigation against the knight Savile for his disgusting sex offences”. Claims that Starmer failed to prosecute Savile have been shared on far-right Telegram channels as well as Facebook for years. In January 2021 it was also propagated by Official Proud Boys Britannia, who described Starmer as a “paedophile/serial killer protector”. The group is affiliated to the US white nationalist misogynistic group and its Canadian wing that was last year named by Ottawa as a terrorist entity. Before the prime minister’s Savile comments, CCDH said it had monitored a spike in the claim last month. One reason is believed to be the US anti-vaccine conspiracist Sherri Tenpenny, who has 159,000 Telegram subscribers and reposted a message in January claiming that Starmer “decided there was ‘insufficient evidence’ to charge Saville”. That message had been viewed more than 220,000 times by the time Johnson repeated the slur.",News/Politics,Far right celebrates after Johnson repeats ‘Savile slur’ in parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/05/far-right-celebrates-after-johnson-repeats-savile-slur-in-parliament
2/6/2022,"The Six Nations is rarely short of dramatic finishes and, from Scotland’s perspective, this latest one will rank right up there. For the first time in 38 years the Scots have registered back-to-back championship wins over the auld enemy and the tense, nerve-tingling manner of this narrow triumph made it all the sweeter for the hosts on a damp, cold Edinburgh evening. As a contest it was often a slow burner but the big final quarter plot twist will haunt England for a while. Finn Russell’s second penalty with eight minutes left technically applied the killer blow but ultimately it was the desperate flapping hands of Luke Cowan-Dickie that did for the visitors. Referee Ben O’Keeffe correctly ruled the England hooker, in trying to stop a Russell cross-kick from reaching the lurking Darcy Graham in the right corner, deliberately knocked the ball out of play and the resultant penalty try and yellow card tipped the balance of the entire game.  Having previously led 17-10, a depleted England were left to cling on with 14 men and Russell duly stuck a final dagger through their hearts. The visiting what ifs were compounded by the decision to substitute Marcus Smith with 17 minutes left despite the fact the Harlequins fly-half had scored all of his side’s points and was looking in control of pretty much everything he surveyed. Neither team, to be honest, looked much like champions elect but the conditions hardly helped. Maybe one day this fixture will take place in dappled spring sunshine with only a gentle breeze lazily ruffling the flags. Dream on. While the elements had eased by kick-off, it was still damp and slippery enough to make ball handling a risky business. At least England knew what to expect from sodden past experience. As Eddie Jones observed in the week: “You don’t take your board shorts and your suntan cream up to Edinburgh for a Six Nations game, do you?” Less familiar was the pre-game theme of Scottish confidence. Maybe it was a contributory factor to the home side’s slightly muted start which had little of the frenzied underdog feel of old. Instead it was England who enjoyed the lion’s share of possession and territory and posed the most searching early questions. A 17th minute Smith penalty, though, was instantly followed by a rhapsody in blue. Stuart Hogg broke thrillingly free in the outside centre channel and fedGraham who slalomed his way superbly past Joe Marchant. On the wing’s elbow was the Stoke-born Ben White, on for his first Test cap as a temporary replacement for Ali Price, who cantered over for a pinch-yourself debut score. Not since the unsung Gary Pratt ran out Ricky Ponting in the 2005 Ashes has a sub been so instantly super. Russell’s angled conversion further compounded the damage but for much of the rest of the half it was England who applied most pressure. A driven maul was held up over the line and only some determined Scottish tackling kept the visitors at bay. A second, straightforward Smith penalty in front of the posts did reduce the deficit to a single point only for a well-struck Russell penalty from 40 metres to send Scotland in at half-time with a 10-6 advantage. If the scoreline did not necessarily reflect the balance of the game, the tackle stats made interesting reading. Scotland made 87 tackles to England’s 43 but missed just four of them, reflecting the added close-quarters steel that defence coach Steve Tandy has been adding for a while. Interestingly, too, there were only three scrums in the first 40 minutes - all of them England put-ins - which is a surprisingly low figure for a wet weather contest. The old game really is changing in front of our eyes. With Scotland making so few mistakes, the onus was very much on England to create something themselves. Their hyper-flexible line of utility backs are all talented individual footballers but increasingly it cried out for a blast of something more dynamic. Sam Simmonds, popping up in the no 12 channel, did his best but the absence of Manu Tuilagi, as is so often the case, was conspicuous. Smith, in particular, could have done with the kind of foil that Andre Esterhuizen offers at Harlequins and slowly but surely it was Scotland who began to turn the psychological screw. Steward spilled a high ball from Price and Russell began to ping low scudding missiles towards the touchlines. It was to England’s credit that they did not crack. With their maul working well and Saracens’ Nick Isiekwe impressing in the lineout, they clawed another three points back through Smith’s third penalty before the drama cranked up several notches. Ironically it was Scotland’s decision to replace their entire front-row which inadvertently played into English hands. O’Keeffe penalised the newcomers for an unnecessary early engage and, suddenly, England had a decent platform to try and exploit. With advantage being played, Smith called a blindside move and Ben Youngs expertly put his alert young fly-half over. Scotland, though, were far from finished. Duhan van der Merwe made one promising surge and then, with England daring to dream, came the Hand of Dickie. It was hard to argue with referee O’Keeffe’s far-reaching conclusion, even though there was no absolute guarantee that the influential Graham would have caught Russell’s deft lob. The rest, from England’s perspective, was tartan torture.",Sport/Sport,Scotland edge out England after Luke Cowan-Dickie’s blunder,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/05/scotland-england-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
2/6/2022,"The UK and its Nato allies will be united in their fight against Russian aggression “wherever and however it might occur”, Boris Johnson has agreed with Emmanuel Macron. During a phone call on Saturday the prime minister and the French president discussed the worrying development of the Ukraine crisis.  Johnson updated Macron on his visit to Kyiv this week, where he met the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. During his visit, Johnson said there was intelligence suggesting the threat of “an imminent military campaign” by Russia was “a clear and present danger”. A No 10 spokesperson said of Johnson’s call with Macron: “They agreed that finding a diplomatic solution to the current tensions must remain the overriding priority. “The prime minister and president Macron stressed that Nato must be united in the face of Russian aggression. They agreed to continue to work together to develop a package of sanctions which would come into force immediately should Russia further invade Ukraine. “The leaders discussed their work to strengthen Nato’s Eastern flank, ensuring that allies are fully defended against malicious Russian activity, wherever and however it might occur.” European leaders are due to travel to both Moscow and Kyiv in a bid to calm tensions. Macron is expected to visit Moscow on Monday and Kyiv on Tuesday, while the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will travel to Kyiv on 14 February and to Moscow the next day. Foreign secretary Liz Truss had been due to travel to Ukraine with the prime minister on Tuesday to meet the Ukrainian president, but had to drop out of the trip after testing positive for coronavirus. Truss will reportedly travel to Moscow soon. On Thursday, US officials claimed to have evidence of an elaborate plot by the Kremlin to make a “very graphic” fake video of a Ukrainian attack as a pretext for a military invasion. Downing Street said on Friday it has “high confidence” Russia is planning to fabricate a reason for incurring on Ukraine. Johnson’s official spokesman said: “We have high confidence Russia is planning to engineer a pretext blaming Ukraine for an attack in order to justify a Russian incursion into Ukraine. “The details in the specific reports today are credible and extremely concerning. We’ve conducted our own analysis on this intelligence and share the US’s conclusion. “We’re considering options for further military deployments to support Nato’s eastern flank, we’re not at the stage of setting out details yet but we will come forward with those in due course.” In January, the US and UK alleged that Russia has deployed operatives inside Ukraine to stage false-flag attacks and has recruited Ukrainians to take over a puppet government that would collaborate with Russian occupation forces.",News/World news,UK and France agree Nato must ‘unite against Russian aggression’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/05/uk-and-france-agree-nato-must-unite-against-russian-aggression
2/6/2022,"In May 2013, Boris Johnson announced a flagship £1.7bn scheme for Chinese investors to transform east London docks into the capital’s third financial district. It was the biggest commercial property deal he had announced during his time as London mayor and he pledged it would be a “beacon for eastern investors”.  While Johnson’s proposals for a new island airport in the Thames estuary and a new bridge linking Scotland and Northern Ireland never got off the ground, he hoped the Royal Albert Dock project would boost his mayoral legacy. Despite the grand ambitions, residents say there has been no significant work at the 35-acre industrial site for more than two years and the scheme now appears on the brink of collapse. The Greater London Authority (GLA) confirmed last week a “final termination notice” had been served on the developer because of delays. The authority also said receivers have been appointed over six companies within the group structure of the developer. Unmesh Desai, a Labour London Assembly member who represents east London, said: “This was meant to be a jewel in the crown for east London and it’s now a ghost town. “It’s bitterly disappointing and we need to establish what has gone wrong and whether the proper due diligence was done on the project.” There were concerns when City Hall first announced the project about its profitability, but it was hoped there would be a plentiful supply of Chinese funds to ensure its success. Johnson said at the time the commercial, retail and leisure complex on publicly owned land was intended to create thousands of jobs and bring in billions of pounds of investment for the UK economy. He said the 19th-century docks and waterways were once again be the “arteries of trade and commerce”. The project was headed by charismatic property developer Xu Weiping, head of the developer ABP (London) Investment Ltd. According to a profile in Moneyweek, he started out designing knitting machines before working as a civil servant in Beijing. His previous development experience was mainly limited to a large development in one of Beijing’s least affluent areas. In an interview in November 2013, Weiping – who was described as often being driven around in a red Bentley and owning a collection of luxury watches - admitted he did not yet have all of the money for the project. “There’s no need for me to prepare £1bn in cash,” he said. “The market is quite good.” When Chinese president Xi Jinping made a state visit to Britain in October 2015, famously enjoying a pint of beer at a Buckinghamshire pub with then prime minister David Cameron, he presided over a new signing deal for fresh investment in the Royal Albert Dock project. In 2019, Weiping admitted the project was struggling. He said there had been an adverse impact on marketing and letting for the project because of uncertainty around Brexit. He said his development company was reviewing the future of the scheme. The latest accounts for ABP (London) Investment Ltd, the property developer for Royal Albert Dock, said its parent company was trying to raise further funds for the project. The accounts state there is uncertainty whether this is possible and “this may cast significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern”. Another company involved in the development, also controlled by Weiping, says in its accounts it has failed to make contracted repayments on a £99m bank loan. A GLA spokesperson said: “The GLA has been concerned for some time by the lack of progress by the developer at Royal Albert Dock and served ABP with a Final Termination Notice in August after the developer proved unable to meet all of its obligations …for delivery of this scheme.” It said ABP’s guarantor, Dauphin Holdings Group, also controlled by Weiping, had now formally stepped into the project. It is understood the Chinese-backed developer is likely to be removed from the project later this year unless it complies with the delivery schedule and contract. The GLA said the scheme was being delivered in six phases and most of phase one, comprising 560,000 square feet of office and retail space, was completed in April 2019. It says since this time “no significant activity, lettings or investment has been undertaken by ABP”. It said most of the group was not in insolvency, but Deloitte had been appointed as receivers over six companies within the ABP group structure. Deloitte declined to comment. The standstill on the work is likely to lead to demands for an investigation into how the deal was structured and approved. A Channel 4 investigation in November 2014 raised questions over whether more robust checks should have been conducted on the ABP business before agreeing the deal. Caroline Pidgeon, a Liberal Democrat London Assembly member, said: “Boris Johnson’s record as mayor of London often seemed as though he thought that vital rules of fairness in procurement and setting of contracts were something he could ignore. His record … should be examined as closely as his record as prime minister.” ABP (London) Investment Ltd did not respond to a request for comment.",News/Business,Boris Johnson’s flagship London dock scheme on brink of collapse,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/05/boris-johnsons-flagship-london-dock-scheme-on-brink-of-collapse
2/6/2022,"On 9 November 2019, Kumanjayi Walker, a 19-year-old Aboriginal man, was shot dead at his family home in a remote community north-west of Alice Springs, where police officers had gone to arrest him. Four days later, Constable Zachary Rolfe was charged with Walker’s murder.  On Monday, Rolfe’s criminal trial will start at the Northern Territory supreme court in Darwin. Here is the background to the case. Prosecutors allege that Rolfe and another officer sought to arrest Walker at his home in Yuendumu in relation to an outstanding warrant. Prosecutors allege that Walker was shot in the house as Rolfe attempted to arrest him. Rolfe also faces alternate charges of manslaughter or engaging in a violent act causing death. The police officer has pleaded not guilty, and was granted bail soon after the shooting. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The main delays have been caused by the pandemic, the complexity of the case, and legal arguments regarding the evidence or defences that can be used in the trial. The first significant delay occurred in April 2020, when the case was postponed for 10 weeks, partly because essential reports had been delayed by Covid-19 lockdowns and partly because of the size of the brief of evidence. There have been other delays caused by Covid, which have been particularly disruptive as people central to the case, including lawyers, are based outside the territory. Among the legal arguments that have contributed to the delay has been wrangling over the location of the trial, and a contest over possible defences Rolfe could rely on. That argument meant his trial could not start in August 2021 as planned, and it eventually went to the high court.

2/6/2022,"The New York Times acquisition of Wordle has left devotees of the mega-hit word guessing game fearful that it will – like the newspaper’s crossword and other puzzles – end up locked behind a paywall, despite the Times’ assurances to the contrary. While it’s unlikely that any other game will achieve the viral success of Wordle, there are free, browser-based alternatives out there to puzzle over as you sip your morning coffee.  Wordle’s creator, Josh Wardle, has said he loves the plethora of Wordle clones that have sprung up in his game’s wake, though his fans have been less impressed by apps trying to cash in on his work. Most clones copy Wordle’s current ethos: they don’t cost anything to play, run in a browser and are ad-free. Variants range from straight-up copies (often without Wordle’s one-game-a-day limit and with additional difficulty options) to versions in other languages, including Chinese and Tamil. There are the themed versions too, featuring swearwords, queer culture and Pokémon. Then there are the truly bizarre – like Letterle, which asks you to guess a single letter, Absurdle, self-described as “adversarial Wordle”, and word.rodeo, which lets you create custom challenges for a friend. My group chat is obsessed with Numble, in which players reverse-engineer a maths equation, and Quordle, where you play four games of Wordle at once. The New York Times has a handful of well-designed, minimalist-looking games available outside its paywall, including Mini Crossword and Spelling Bee, though the latter does ask you to subscribe once you guess enough words. Play Four by Merriam-Webster is a spin on the mini-crossword that offers a one-a-day fix, while there are the old standbys of online Sudoku and my personal obsession, Nonograms (better known to Nintendo fans as Picross). Of course, there’s always the Guardian’s various offerings online or on iOS or Android – though the apps do require a paid subscription. This game requires players to place random historical facts into chronological order. Wikitrivia starts with one historical event already on the board. You then begin drawing cards and placing them on a timeline relative to the other events in play. Was Australia discovered before or after the founding of the Indian stock exchange? When did the Regency period end relative to the birth of Catherine de’ Medici? You can make three mistakes before the game ends, with the score showing how many cards you managed to place correctly before messing up. Sharing your results is possible but, given the random nature of each run, it feels somewhat pointless. The nice thing about Wikitrivia, as the Guardian’s Alyx Gorman says, is it makes you feel smart – you need to have some knowledge of when things happened, at least relative to other things, and having that knowledge confirmed (however trivial) is a satisfying little experience. That has its downsides, too: how could I possibly have known that Rashi, a French rabbi and commentator, was born in 1040? That’s trivia for you. Ever used Google street view? GeoGuessr dumps you in a random place on Earth – at least, the parts of Earth that have been mapped by Google – and challenges you to guess where in the world you are, giving you more points the closer your guess is to the mark. You will need to sign up for an account though, which is a bit annoying. In classic mode you can roam around a bit, with five guesses to score as many points as possible, starting a new location with every guess. There are a bunch of different modes that limit you to various countries, or place you only near landmarks, and the “daily challenge” feature replicates the group one-a-day nature of Wordle. The genius of GeoGuessr is that it makes you feel like a detective, even if what you’re doing is the most basic detective work imaginable. Signs especially are invaluable for determining the primary language in your mystery location, but other context clues – forms of architecture, the flora and fauna, the side of the road cars are driving on, and so on – activate your brain in a way most other puzzle games don’t. Of course, sometimes GeoGuessr just dumps you on a long stretch of barren highway next to some terrain you’ve never seen; you’ll just have to blindly guess and hope for the best. On a free account you can only play for five minutes every 15 minutes, but that’s more than enough to get your daily fix in.",Arts/Games,"Worried about losing Wordle?

2/6/2022,"As four New South Wales electorates prepare to hold byelections next weekend, one face is noticeably absent from Liberal party campaign material. In Bega, where the former teacher, scientist and small business owner Fiona Kotvojs is running, the outgoing local MP Andrew Constance is everywhere: on how-to-vote cards expressing support for her, on leaflets praising her “experience and track record”.  Bridget Sakr’s leaflets in Strathfield in Sydney’s west are all about her personal story, with references from the federal MP Fiona Martin and other local figures. While in Willougby, former premier Gladys Berejiklian’s endorsements for Menzies Research thinktank head and new candidate, Tim James, are plastered far and wide. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, though, is missing in action. In fact, the only place the premier features prominently is in Labor’s campaign material. Posters of the premier’s face are bordered unsubtly with biohazard-tape and the words “make him listen, don’t vote Liberal” have been plastered throughout Strathfield. Ahead of next Saturday’s four byelections, Perrottet’s lack of prominence tells the story. Most governments struggle in byelections, especially after 11 years in office. Throw in the loss of the ultra-popular Berejiklian to a corruption scandal, anger over handling of the Omicron wave, and green shoots in the long-dormant NSW Labor party, and the government is concerned. “We’re preparing for it to be bad,” a senior NSW Liberal party figure told the Guardian this week. “How bad is the million dollar question, but it has the potential to set a tone, one way or another.” The byelections will take place in the Labor seat of Strathfield, in Sydney’s west, and three Coalition electorates – Willoughby, in the city’s north, and Monaro and Bega in the state’s south. All four were sparked indirectly by Berejiklian’s resignation. After she quit in October when the state’s anti-corruption watchdog revealed it was investigating her conduct, NSW politics witnessed a rush for the door. Constance quit to run in the federal seat of Gilmore, while former deputy premier John Barilaro, and former Labor leader Jodi McKay, both bowed out of politics. Of the four seats, it’s Labor’s Strathfield that is the most marginal, but all three Coalition seats housed senior government ministers who brought with them a high recognition factor. Ben Raue, a Tally Room election analyst, said seats could certainly be lost. “I think the most likely outcome is that all the seats stay in the same hands, [but] I wouldn’t say the chances of a change are slim. I would say less than 50%, but if it’s 40%, 30%, that’s still a pretty good chance,” Raue said. He said Perrottet “doesn’t have a lot of seats to spare so he has to hold all of them”. The Coalition is already effectively governing in minority, holding 46 seats in the 93-seat lower house. Two former government MPs, Gareth Ward and John Sidoti, both moved to the cross-bench after separate scandals and have continued to vote for the Coalition, meaning the loss of a seat would not be a threat to its ability to hold on to power. But it does make the margin for error going into next Saturday slim. For the Liberals, a large swing, even one that doesn’t result in them losing a seat, will open the door to layers of interpretation about the government leading in to next year’s state election. “If we got a 5% swing against us, I think most people would accept that as expected,” one Liberal party figure said. “If it’s 15%, well, that starts to create some uncomfortable questions leading into the general election next year.” After 11 years and four leaders, including the enormous electoral loss of Berejiklian, a weak showing could create a dangerous narrative for Perrottet. On the other hand, if the Labor party are unable to make headway, it would undo the strides made by opposition leader, Chris Minns, in establishing Labor as a genuine electoral challenger after more than a decade in the political wilderness. “It’s almost a two election strategy,” one Labor party figure said. “We might not win it this time, but you take the wind out of the government’s sails by getting a big swing and then the conversation becomes, ‘is Labor finally ready to take back power in NSW?’”. McKay, who quit as Labor leader in May after a poor showing at an Upper Hunter byelection, previously held Strathfield on a 5% margin. But while the government has preselected a solid candidate in businesswoman and victim support advocate Sakr, whose daughter Veronique was killed in a car crash in Oatlands in 2020, few in the party hold out significant hope of winning. However, the entry of former Sydney Morning Herald columnist Elizabeth Farrelly into the race as an independent could also pose problems for Labor because NSW’s optional preference system allows voters to exhaust their ballot. Monaro, held by the former deputy premier, Barilaro, covers the southern inland parts of the state surrounding Canberra, including the suburb of Queanbeyan. Held by the Nationals on an 11.6% margin, it has been held by Labor as recently as 2011 but is expected to stay in the government’s column. So too is Willoughby, the seat of former premier Berejiklian. Ultra-safe at 21%, the government is in no danger of losing the seat, but some Liberal party insiders fear a substantial swing after the preselection of conservative Tim James in an area traditionally dominated by the party’s moderate faction. It’s Bega, which stretches from just north of the coastal town of Bateman’s Bay to the Victorian border, which is shaping to be the most compelling of the contests. Despite its status as a safe Liberal seat, last held by Constance with a margin of 6.9%, multiple sources expressed a level of fear about the party’s chances of hanging on. “We’re definitely going to take a hit,” one party insider in Bega said. “What we’re hearing is that it might be down to a margin of maybe 2% to 3%. “I would still put my money on the Liberals holding it but when you factor in a three-term government, losing a popular member … it’s going to be tough.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Raue said Bega and Monaro were interesting because it was hard to predict how significant the loss of the previous, high-profile members would be. “The other thing is if there is a decent swing and the ALP does well, there’s a sense of people having to take them seriously.”",News/Australia news,‘We’re preparing for it to be bad’: Perrottet missing in action before NSW byelections,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/06/were-preparing-for-it-to-be-bad-perrottet-missing-in-action-before-nsw-byelections
2/6/2022,"Ali Hussaini cannot recall when he first started wrestling. “I was young!” the 28-year-old exclaims. But for as long as Hussaini can remember, he has wanted to compete on the world stage. “I have always been motivated to one day become a wrestling world champion and go to the Olympics,” he says. Hussaini is a multiple-time Australian wrestling champion, winning his most recent title last May in the men’s 57kg freestyle category. A bricklayer by trade, Hussaini rises early at his home in western Sydney to spend the day on sweltering construction sites. But despite the physically-gruelling nature of his day job, evening after evening Hussaini can be found at a local gym – training himself and coaching others in the finer points of freestyle wrestling.  The wrestler claimed his first major domestic title in 2014, and has been almost unbeatable ever since. Hussaini is instantly recognised at the gym – “anything for the pro” laughs a staff member after spotting him. Even on rest days, Hussaini can be found in his backyard working out with his own weights (despite being in the lightweight category, Hussaini is renowned for his muscular strength). Together with a nightly call to his mother, wrestling provides the daily rhythm to Hussaini’s life. “Sport allows me to keep moving forward,” he offers. But the national champion’s Olympic dreams remain agonisingly out of reach. An ethnic Hazara refugee from Afghanistan, Hussaini arrived by boat in 2013. He remains in Australia on a temporary visa; which, under the federal government’s immigration policy, can never be made permanent. That leaves the wrestler unable to compete in international competition, blocked from wrestling under the Australian flag. In other words, the best wrestler in Australia may never represent the country. “When I arrived here, I was really excited to compete for Australia,” Hussaini says through an interpreter. “I was ready in 2016 to go to Brazil for the Olympics.” But unable to travel, Hussaini could not contest the Olympic qualification event in Algeria. “Because of my visa status, being a stateless person, with no passport, I was not allowed to travel,” he continues. “That crushed my hope.” Nine years after Hussaini arrived in Australia, he is no closer to fulfilling his dream. “Today I am still wrestling and still on a temporary visa,” he says in a deflated tone. “I have done everything I can in Australian wrestling.” His dreams live on – but only just. “It is still a dream that I can represent Australia one day,” he continues. “But time is moving really fast. Looking at my visa situation, it looks like very impossible at the moment.” Hussaini is not the only one. “There are about 5,000 Afghan refugees in this situation in Australia,” says Zaki Haidari from the Jesuit Refugee Service. In August 2012, the Gillard government froze the refugee application process for anyone who had arrived by boat; in 2014, the Abbott government amended immigration law to prevent boat arrivals from ever receiving a permanent visa. That prohibition still stands today. “We cannot get permanent protection from the Australian government, ever,” Haidari adds. This “temporary” cohort can lawfully work, but are effectively unable to pursue further education. These refugees are unable to sponsor visa applications for immediate family back home to relocate, and if they start a family in Australia, their children face the same limbo. “Ten years is a long time we’ve been away from family,” says Haidari. “We can buy a lot of things, but we cannot buy time. Once it is gone, it’s gone.” On Tuesday, to mark the return of federal Parliament, Afghan refugees from across the country will gather in Canberra to demand an end to the temporary visa limbo. “We are physically safe here but mentally, emotionally, we are dying,” says Haidari. Hussaini grew up in a small village in the province of Maidan Wardak, outside the capital, Kabul. The Persian-speaking Hazara people are a persecuted minority in Afghanistan. “The Hazaras have been persecuted for a century or more,” explains Haidari. “But especially lately.” The Taliban have massacred and persecuted the Hazara throughout their reign. The Hazara are predominantly Shi’a muslims, while the majority of Afghans – including the Taliban – practice Sunni Islam. As a teenager, Hussaini moved to Kabul to train professionally as a wrestler. Despite the post-9/11 American occupation and establishment of a new Afghan government, the Hazara continued to face persecution – including from Taliban rebel forces. As the security situation deteriorated in the early 2010s, it became increasingly dangerous for Hussaini to travel between Kabul and his home town. “The roads were not safe,” he recalls. “Every day it was high-risk.” Hussaini’s brother was kidnapped, tortured and killed by the Taliban. “It was a tough time,” he says. In 2013, barely an adult, Hussaini fled Afghanistan, alone. He flew to India, then Singapore, then Malaysia, before crossing to Indonesia. Hussaini subsequently made the journey by boat to Christmas Island, where he was detained by Australian immigration authorities and claimed asylum. “I was searching for a safe country,” he says. “I thought Australia would allow me to achieve my hopes and dreams.” He was mistaken. Hussaini spent several months in detention centres, shuffling between Christmas Island, Darwin and Western Australia, before being released on a bridging visa. Hussaini has been in limbo ever since: accepted as a refugee but unable to apply for a permanent visa, with no pathway to residency. “I will be on temporary visa forever,” he says. Throughout his arduous journey, the wrestler never stopped training – even during his stint in immigration detention. “Wrestling is a good distraction for me,” he says. “I can’t see my family, the visa, the crisis in Afghanistan – there’s a lot happening in my head. But wrestling gives me hope. Even though my life is not under my control – it feels like it is controlled by the immigration system – wrestling is something I can control.” Even still, the fall of Kabul last year has taken a heavy toll on Hussaini and the wider Hazara community. “Our families are dying in Afghanistan,” says Haidari. The refugee advocate says there have been a number of suicides, and increasing rates of depression, among the refugee cohort. Hussaini’s immediate family fled to Pakistan following the Taliban’s resurgence, which means they are out of harm’s way for now. But he is unable to bring them to Australia and cannot travel to Pakistan to see them (while refugees on temporary visas can get special travel documents, solely for travelling to see immediate family, Pakistan is not currently granting visitor visas to such travellers). “It is hard for me, not knowing when I can see my family,” he adds. He worries about his ageing mother; never missing their daily calls. His mother asks when he will come to see her again, but he cannot answer. “I say ‘I don’t know when I’m coming.’” Despite the enduring hardship, Hussaini remains optimistic. “I love it here,” he says. “It’s a peaceful country. I don’t face discrimination that I used to face in [Afghanistan]. I can see dozens of different nationalities all living together peacefully.” Approaching a decade since he arrived on Christmas Island, Hussaini says his predicament – his permanent limbo – remains baffling. “It’s a hard thing to accept,” he admits. “But I don’t have any other option. I just have to enjoy the life I have.” He tries to stay positive and give back to his community, providing training and mentoring to emerging wrestlers. “Life has been tough for me, but I must be a nice person,” he adds. “Otherwise there is no difference between me and the government.” Despite all this, he insists that he would pull on the green and gold in a heartbeat if given the opportunity to wrestle internationally. “The Australian government punished me because of my arrival on a boat, but the Australian people have always been nice to me,” he reflects. “Of course I would represent the Australians.” Hussaini’s sporting ambitions seem distant. Following the fall of Kabul, the Morrison government pledged that Afghan temporary visa holders would not be sent back, but there has been no indication the status quo will otherwise change. Yet Hussaini still dreams of competing under his adopted flag at the Olympics. “The hope will always be with me,” he says.",News/Australia news,Ali Agshar Hussaini: Australian wrestling champ who can’t compete for Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/06/ali-agshar-hussaini-australian-wrestling-champ-who-cant-compete-for-australia
2/6/2022,"In the already Covid-stretched hospitals of northern New South Wales, health workers are struggling with another growing pressure caused by the pandemic. House prices have soared in Byron Bay and surrounding areas since Covid lockdowns and work-from-home inspired many to flee the city for a sea or tree change.  And while the impacts on buyers or renters in the area have been well documented, hospital workers say it’s having far-reaching effects on the community’s health. The consequences of the housing crush are being felt at hospitals such as Ballina, where nurse and New South Wales Nurses and Midwives’ Association (NSWNMA) representative Suzie Melchior works. “That’s not just staff struggling to get permanent housing, but we’ve seen people who are almost itinerant,” she said. “We’re not used to people living out of their vehicles, their cars. That seems to be a new thing.” Every additional stressor is being felt due to the surge in demand brought on by Covid, and already prevalent GP shortages. “They don’t have a GP so they’re coming to us for their basic healthcare needs,” Melchior said. “They know they’re not meant to be accessing emergency departments to get their blood pressure medication or their gout medication but they don’t have the option.” Long-term renter and mother of four Jenny – not her real name – is at breaking point after two years of housing instability, and has seen her health slide as a result. “There have been moments where I ask, ‘What’s the point in going on?’,” she said. “My stress levels are through the roof. A human right to safety and shelter – there’s nothing remotely close to that now.” Jenny has a month left at her short-term rental in Alstonville and after months of searching still can’t find a secure and affordable next step. She is considering buying a caravan or pitching a tent. “I wouldn’t have considered that in the past but what are our options? What else can we do?” she said. Melchior said many patients were presenting without Medicare cards because they didn’t have an address for them to be posted to, taking up extra admin time that overworked staff didn’t have. “There’s a ripple effect,” she said. “It is small in the scheme of things but if you multiply that across how many other people are having similar issues … it’s big.” Another local nurse – who wished to remain anonymous – said she was also seeing more patients without a fixed address. “Even in the maternity unit we see it – new mums living in caravan parks because they can’t find housing,” she told the Guardian. The median house price in the Byron shire has more than doubled over the past five years, overtaking Sydney to hit $1.7m, according to the latest data from Domain. Prices in Lismore, Tweed and Ballina have all also risen more than 30% – outpacing the state’s capital, bringing with it a sizeable increase in levels of housing stress. This week, Byron Shire council sought to address the issue with a proposal, unanimously supported, to lobby the NSW government to “recycle” stamp duty and land taxes collected in the area into local social housing for the most vulnerable. “There’s a clear connection between house price inflation and homelessness,” said councillor Mark Swivel, who proposed the motion. “There’s a pressing need for urgent action.” Speaking in support, councillor Sarah Ndiaye said the housing boom was making the local community increasingly vulnerable, while the wealth is poured into state coffers. “Things like Airbnb and short-term holiday homes and the high-turnover properties... it’s all tax generated for the state,” she said. “The state government is getting all the carrots and local councils are getting sticks.” Tenants’ Union NSW head, Leo Patterson Ross, said he had noticed a jump in the number of renters in the area asking for advice. Many people had reported being served “no grounds” evictions before the properties were relisted for more money, pricing them out of a community they once called home. “We’ve seen double-digit rent increases year-on-year for a couple of years in some areas,” Patterson Ross said. “It has this really ongoing widespread effect and what it boils down to is that there’s just not enough homes that are actually affordable to the communities that need them.” Groups such as Homelessness NSW have been calling on the government to build 50,000 social housing units across the state over the next 10 years to deal with the crisis. “Homeless services across the state are telling us they are seeing people fronting up needing support, having never been homeless before,” the organisation’s chief executive, Katherine McKernan, said. “If you’re in unstable housing, you’re more worried about where you’re going to sleep in a week’s time than going to the doctor and getting yourself taken care of.” Doctors will always help homeless patients, but some factors make it harder, according to the AMA NSW president, Dr Danielle McMullen. “If you’re struggling with homelessness, you might also be struggling with finances, to be able to put food on the table, and then buying medications is another cost,” she said. “Visiting a doctor can often have an out-of-pocket cost and those are barriers to care. “Depending on the illness, housing stability is just important for our physical and mental health.”",News/Australia news,"In northern NSW, housing instability is becoming a health risk",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/06/in-northern-nsw-housing-instability-is-becoming-a-health-risk
2/6/2022,"Head down to Sydney’s Manly Cove on a weekend, and you might see groups of people crouching diligently on the sand. They’re not searching for shells or bloodworms, but something just as visually striking, not least because it shouldn’t be there: coloured pieces of hard plastic, fragments of polystyrene foam and fibres from fishing line. For the last three years, a group of volunteers has been surveying the beach each month for microplastics, as part of the Australian Microplastics Assessment Project.Colloquially known as Ausmap, the citizen science project has collected more than 3.5m pieces of microplastic from more than 300 beaches around the country, ranging from Thursday Island in the north to Bruny Island, off Tasmania’s south-east coast.  Volunteers collect plastics between 1mm and 5mm in length; pellets, fibres and fragments are meticulously sorted and documented. “That’s what we can see easily in our sieves,” Ausmap’s program director, Dr Michelle Blewit, says. “Microplastic doesn’t always refer to things that are microscopic,” she says. “Obviously it breaks up further and further … the smaller it gets, then there’s more chance of it being ingested by animals.” Blewitt, a marine scientist, says more than 8,500 people have been involved in the project since its launch in 2018. Its goal is to quantify the scale of microplastic pollution across Australia, and help address the growing problem. Microplastics – any type of plastic less than 5mm in length – are virtually everywhere. They are found in the most remote places on Earth, from the world’s deepest oceanic trench to its most pristine mountains. They are in the air we breathe, the tap water we drink, and the food we eat. They have been found in human placenta and poo. On average, we ingest about one credit card’s worth of plastic a week, according to 2019 Australian analysis. “There are actually more microplastics on the seabed floor than floating on the ocean surface,” says Dr Denise Hardesty, a principal research scientist at the CSIRO. The presence of microplastics in aquatic environments doesn’t necessarily equate to harm to wildlife, Hardesty says. But there is a growing body of evidence showing that microplastics have negative impacts on at least some marine organisms. “For a really small animal organism, it can block the gut, it can make it so that an organism doesn’t feed as efficiently,” Hardesty says. “It can affect its reproduction, it can affect its lifecycle and trajectory.” Microplastics have been found to make mussels lose their grip, and to alter the behaviour of fish – one Australian study of damselfish found they were likely to take more risks and die earlier. Also of concern is the accumulation of microplastics in animals further up the food chain. “We even find microplastics in plankton, which are really at the base of the food chain and help keep our oceans healthy,” Hardesty says. “We have everything from very small fish to very large whales that eat plankton.” Plastics alone are one problem, but then there’s also the chemicals with which they interact. “Some of the plastics out there are quite porous,” Blewitt says. “Once out there in the environment, they can be attracted like a magnet to a whole bunch of other chemicals.” “If an animal consumes these plastics, then they’re not only getting a dose of the plastic itself … but also whatever contaminants are attached to those plastics as well.” Scientists are also concerned about interactions between plastic pollution and global heating on marine populations. A recent University of Sydney study found that fish grow slower ​​when exposed to both the industrial chemical bisphenol A – a common compound used in plastics manufacturing – and higher temperatures. “Discarded plastics – as they break down, they leach BPA that’s been used in their manufacture,” Prof Frank Seebacher, one of the study’s authors, says. “So wherever you have lots of manufacturing plants, lots of plastic pollution, you will find reasonably high levels of BPA.” What effects microplastics have on human health is still contentious. “We obviously can’t feed plastic to humans,” Blewitt says. “Health implications will probably rear their ugly head in the years to come.” Prof Andreas Suhrbier, who leads the inflammation biology group at QIMR Berghofer, says while microplastics have been found to damage human cells under lab conditions, compelling evidence to date has been scarce. “There is no consistent common understanding of if and what microplastic consumption would affect human health,” he says. Suhrbier believes new research of his may provide a clue. A recent study his team conducted in mice found animals that had ingested microplastics did not show any accumulation in internal organs, nor any significant changes in their microbiome. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning However, when they were exposed to a virus that resulted in arthritis, the mice who had eaten microplastics had joint inflammation for a significantly longer period. The team surmised that the microplastics activated immune cells that resulted in the inflammation. The research squares with a separate study, published in December, which found significantly higher levels of microplastics in the faeces of people who had inflammatory bowel disease – Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis – than people who didn’t. The researchers also concluded there was a correlation between the concentration of microplastics in the gut and the severity of disease. “Our emerging hypothesis is that plastic in the gut causes some level of inflammation,” Suhrbier says. Less is known about the health effects of even smaller plastic particles, ​​nanoplastics, at sizes ranging between 1 nanometer and 1 micron. Dr Cheng Fang, a senior research fellow at the University of Newcastle, says in theory, nanosized particles can very easily “pass through the digestive system into the body, and can be transported by blood”. His research has estimated that whipper snippers generate thousands of microplastics and billions of nanoplastics each minute when cutting grass. In January, scientists reported detecting nanoplastic pollution in polar regions for the first time. “[We’re] really in the dark at this moment [about the health effects],” Fang says. “Plastics and microplastics are ubiquitous,” Hardesty says. “They’re in our waterways, they’re in our stormwater drains, they’re being shed by tyres from cars, they’re being shed from carpet fibres in people’s homes.” She emphasises the importance of prevention at the source, citing the need for reducing reliance on single-use plastic. “People focus on microplastics, but most microplastics start out as larger plastics,” she says. “It’s actually starting with changing some of our consumption behaviour, [and] plastics manufacturing all up.” “We have power with what and how we choose to purchase,” Hardesty says. “Within Australia, we don’t need to buy bottled water.” “Your can lobby your government … You can support buying in bulk and … speak up against some of the very hard to recycle items, like soft plastics, multi-layered laminates.” By identifying microplastic hotspots, Ausmap is beginning to implement litter reduction strategies in certain coastal areas. They have installed nets to capture waste from stormwater outlets, “to identify which subcatchment is bringing down which kind of debris”, Blewitt says. The project has identified Dee Why lagoon, in Sydney’s Northern Beaches, as a microplastic hotspot, with an estimated 3.1m pieces entering the area yearly. “We were able to identify that nurdles – which are the resin pellets, the basis of plastic when it gets made in its base form – were coming down on one particular catchment,” Blewitt says. With support from the NSW Environment Protection Authority, Ausmap has developed a micro-litter reduction strategy, which it is piloting in three catchments, Blewitt says. “Hopefully we’ll be able to use this framework to be able to help identify where those potential hotspots might be … and then how do they stop it within their local catchment before it lands in the waterways as well.”",News/Environment,Australians ingest a credit card’s worth of plastic a week – so what’s it doing to us? ,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/06/australians-ingest-a-credit-cards-worth-of-plastic-a-week-so-whats-it-doing-to-us
2/6/2022,"The announcement took place in a fashion Australians have come to expect in election years, with the prime minister, Scott Morrison, cuddling up to a furry marsupial while promising record investment. This time it was a plan for the Australian government to spend $50m to improve the protection and recovery of one of the nation’s most-loved animals, the koala.  Fifty million for a single species is certainly significant, particularly when you consider $10m in grants is to be shared between 100 animals and plants the government identified last year as priorities in a new threatened species strategy. But whether or not it makes a difference in turning around the fortunes of an animal – that a New South Wales parliamentary inquiry found could be extinct in that state by 2050 – could depend on multiple outstanding policies and decisions that are due to be settled in 2022. “Money alone isn’t the issue to save the koala,” says Alexia Wellbelove, a senior campaign manager at Humane Society International (HSI). “You need a strong conservation framework.” Much has been said about koala recovery since bushfires burned millions of hectares of land in Australia’s black summer fires in 2019-20. Already a prominent species in campaigns run by conservation organisations for stronger environmental protections, the koala’s plight was met with new urgency after images of burnt and starving animals were seen around the world. HSI, WWF Australia and the International Fund for Animal Welfare argue that the combined effects of multiple, ongoing threats – global heating, disease and habitat destruction – mean the species is on an accelerated track toward extinction. They submitted a nomination to the federal government calling on it to urgently assess the koala populations of Queensland, NSW and the Australian Capital Territory for an upgraded listing under national environmental laws. Listed as “vulnerable” since 2012, the koala now requires the more serious status of “endangered” due to continued declines in population numbers and habitat, they said. They also called on the Morrison government to finally develop a recovery plan that had been identified under national laws as a requirement for the species since 2012, but which successive Australian governments have failed to deliver. The nomination was accepted for assessment and the threatened species scientific committee – an independent body that advises the government on conservation listings – handed its recommendation that the koala be officially listed as endangered to the federal environment minister, Sussan Ley, late last year. A final version of a proposed recovery plan was handed to Ley for ministerial signoff around the same time. Unlike some past ministers in the portfolio, Ley has shown willingness to accept the deadlines and recommendations of the scientific body and her decision about the endangered listing – which must be made by mid-March – is expected imminently. A spokesperson said Ley is reviewing the committee’s advice and would make her decision in accordance with her statutory obligations. They said the minister was reviewing the final draft of the recovery plan at the same time. IFAW’s regional director, Rebecca Keeble, says patience has worn thin among conservationists almost 10 years after a national strategy to save the koala expired. “We need to understand what the strategy is to save this species and what that’s going to cost because $50m is just a drop in the ocean,” she says. “Without addressing the root cause of their decline, which is habitat loss and climate change, we’re just plugging holes in a sinking ship.” Australian governments of all levels have acknowledged the koala’s trajectory needs to change. But destruction of koala habitat continues and development in important areas, such as Campbelltown in Sydney’s south-west, continues to be approved. Data from the Queensland and NSW governments, shows that land-clearing in both states continues to rise. The former NSW environment minister, Matt Kean, declared he wanted to double the number of koalas in the state by 2050, shortly after a parliamentary inquiry found they were on track for extinction. He also announced last year the government would spend $193m over a five-year period on a statewide plan for koala conservation. But that plan, known as the NSW koala strategy, is yet to be seen despite a previous strategy having expired in the middle of 2021. Promised new codes for land management and private native forestry, as well as an updated koala planning policy are also outstanding almost 18 months after koala habitat management nearly split the NSW Coalition. The policies are all issues to be resolved this year by a new ministerial team of James Griffin in environment, the agriculture minister, Dugald Saunders, and the deputy premier, Paul Toole. “The NSW government has taken no real steps to protect koala habitat,” says Jacqui Mumford, the acting chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW. Last year, the council brought together a group of wildlife carers who called on the Perrottet government to increase habitat protections to reduce the number of animals that were ending up in hospital care, sometimes for repeat visits. “What we really want to see is the release of the overdue koala strategy,” Jacqui says. A spokesperson for Griffin said detailed targets for koala populations and expenditure would form part of a new koala strategy but gave no date for its release. They said the government was also “reviewing the PNF (private native forestry) codes of practice to ensure robust protection for koalas.” The $50m announced by the Morrison government last week includes $20m for health and habitat protection projects, $10m for community activities such as habitat restoration, $2m to improve koala health, $1m for koala care and treatment and $10m for a national koala monitoring program. That monitoring program is an extension of a koala audit it announced in 2020 with an initial $2m in funding. The surveys for that koala count have faced delays due to Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns, and the government handed carriage of the program to the CSIRO last year. It expects the audit will be finalised late in 2022. But still to be resolved are the overarching protections not just for koalas but for all of Australia’s wildlife at a national level. A once-in-a-decade review of federal environment laws by the former competition watchdog head Graeme Samuel in 2020 found successive Australian governments had comprehensively failed in their duty to protect Australia’s environment. Samuel made 38 recommendations to transform the act, including a proposal for new national environmental standards that require clear outcomes for Australia’s plants and animals. The government has never issued a response to any of those recommendations, instead drafting a bill that would reduce its role in environmental decision making by giving state governments carriage of decisions under the national act – that bill has stalled in the Senate. A draft set of national standards put forward by the government last year does not contain the improved protections Samuel had in mind. “If we had really good national environmental standards that were focused on environmental outcomes we could actually prevent the destruction of koala habitat,” Wellbelove says. Jess Abrahams, national nature campaigner at the Australian Conservation Foundation, says the $50m was welcome and a sign the government understood the decline of koalas was a serious issue for the Australian public. But he says the task for all of Australia’s threatened wildlife is far greater. In December, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature added 124 new Australian entries to its red list of threatened species, including spiders and insects on Kangaroo Island that were badly affected by the black summer fires. Almost 2,000 species and habitats are listed as threatened under Australian environmental laws. The state of the environment report, produced by the government every five years, is due early this year and is expected to show declines have continued. “It’s obvious the koala is an iconic and cute and cuddly creature and the PM had his photo opportunity with a koala,” Abrahams says. “But there’s a ton of species that aren’t charismatic – like the spiders on Kangaroo Island – and I sadly can’t see that kind of money coming to those and all the other species on our threatened species list. “We need to do a whole lot more.”",News/Environment,‘A drop in the ocean’: government’s $50m koala pledge won’t tackle root cause of decline,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/06/a-drop-in-the-ocean-governments-50m-koala-pledge-wont-tackle-root-cause-of-decline
2/6/2022,"Ten years ago, Australian Amber Bourke was in her early 20s and backpacking through Egypt when she discovered something astonishing about herself. In a little village on the Sinai peninsula she came across a place that taught “free diving” – underwater diving without any breathing apparatus – and decided to give it a try. “I held my breath for four minutes and I dove to 18 metres,” says Bourke, who is the current women’s Australian pool and depth freediving champion. “And both of those things, I didn’t realise was possible.”  Bourke had been a champion synchronised swimmer when she was a teenager, so already knew she could hold her breath for several minutes at a time. But discovering free diving “just opened my eyes to the possibilities … and I just got hooked on a feeling of diving deeper and wanted to see what I was capable of and how deep I could go.” By 2018, Bourke had established herself as one of the best competitive free divers in the world, and in deep waters off the coast of the Philippines, was ready to attempt to break the women’s world record in the discipline of “constant weight no fins”. Considered one of the most challenging forms of the sport, a diver descends vertically in deep water on a single breath, using only muscle strength to propel them downwards. With every metre of descent, the compressive pressure on the body increases, shrinking the spaces that contain air. By 30 metres down – the maximum depth physiologists in the early days of the sport thought humans were capable of reaching – the pressure exerted on the body is four times greater than on the surface and the volume of air inside the body has shrunk to one quarter. Once negative buoyancy is reached, the diver begins to freefall. Bourke reached a depth of 73 metres – a world record – but a split second blackout once she reached the surface disqualified her. “If you stay underwater long enough, there’s always the chance that your oxygen will drop to a level where your brain will decide to shut down in order to protect itself from brain damage,” Bourke says. “So, in a way, it’s a good thing … but frustrating at the end of a long dive.” The men’s world record for “constant weight no fins” is 102 metres, taking four minutes and 14 seconds. With fins, it is 131 metres. For the discipline of “static apnea”, where a competitor doesn’t dive but just submerges themselves under water, the longest breath-hold is 11 minutes and 54 seconds. When 100% oxygen is breathed in prior to the attempt, the record is 24 minutes and 37 seconds. Dr Anthony Bain, a vascular physiologist from the University of Windsor in Canada, has researched the physiology of extreme breath-holding – including conducting experiments with elite free divers – and says many of those at the professional level have larger lung volumes than the average person. Studies in native diving populations, for example the Bajau people in south-east Asia, “have also demonstrated larger spleens, which will theoretically allow for longer breath holds via splenic contraction and release of oxygen bound red blood cells”. Primarily, however, the ability to survive while submerged for a prolonged time is a learned skill. According to Bain, studies suggest that elite free divers have “enhanced” their Mammalian Dive Response. Theorised to be an evolutionary adaptation – a vestige from billions of years ago when all life was aquatic – it’s a reflex that’s triggered when a mammal’s face comes into contact with water. It prompts a number of physiological responses that promote survival, such as the slowing of the heart rate and metabolism, and a redirection of blood to vital organs, including to the lungs to bolster them against pressure. While Bourke doesn’t know if she has any innate physiological differences – she has never been tested – she knows that over a decade of training she has learned how to better use the space in her lungs. Even at 70 metres down, she can still “bring in” more air from her lungs. Free diving is gaining popularity as a pastime, with schools popping up along the Australian coastline, but becoming an elite free diver takes patience. Progression is slow – it often takes years to achieve several extra metres in depth, as the body becomes accustomed to pressure. “When I first dove to 30 metres deep, I really felt a lot of pressure on my body, and especially on my chest, it feels like you’re being crushed,” Bourke says. “But now, diving to 70 meters, I don’t feel that pressure at all.” The major adaptation though is psychological: developing a conscious ability to withstand the urge to breathe. According to Bain, an untrained person starts to undergo “involuntary breathing movements” after no longer than two to three minutes underwater, when the “body has barely desaturated with oxygen”. Elite free divers, however, are able to mentally push through this point, holding their breath until they “majorly desaturate their blood of oxygen”. Among free diving instructors, like Clinton Laurence from the Gold Coast, who is also a clinical psychologist, psychological strategies such as mindfulness are key to training. “That is where you observe the thought, ‘I have to breathe’,” he says. “But you just observe it. ‘Yep, there’s that thought again. That’s OK.’ And you just keep going.” Bourke says she enters a “meditative state” by slowing her breathing before she enters the water. Then, “it’s about maintaining that relaxed state, and for me, that’s really about staying in the moment and not thinking too far into the future, because if you think about how long you’re planning to stay under water and how deep you’re planning to dive, then it’s easy to get overwhelmed and to panic.” While the pandemic has stalled most international competitions, Bourke is still training – she does long sessions swimming underwater in the pool around four times a week, plus working out in the gym – alongside her work as an electrician and a free-diving instructor. Once competition resumes, she’ll be back pursuing world records. “When I first started, I was like, ‘I didn’t even know this was humanly possible’, but it’s just amazing what humans can do.”",News/Society,‘I didn’t even know this was humanly possible’: the woman who can descend into the sea on one breath,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/06/i-didnt-even-know-this-was-humanly-possible-the-woman-who-can-descend-into-the-sea-on-one-breath
2/6/2022,"Lured by the landscape and the inspiration that it offered, I envisaged a two-week visit when I arrived at the youth hostel in the mountains. I planned to work remotely, finish off the degree that I was working on part-time, and hike. I didn’t think I’d stay six months. But since international borders were shut, shelving my plans to move back overseas, I’d ended up in limbo in my small hometown. As a long-term expat, I was now making up for time away from my family who I loved. But all my school friends had moved away years ago, and after several months, it became isolating. Where to go to that wasn’t locked down?  A former art nouveau ballroom in a mountain youth hostel became the unexpected answer, the setting for my life during a large chunk of the pandemic. In a year when so many people were alone, I accidentally moved into the biggest share house I’d ever lived in. By the time I left last year, I’d struck up friendships with people from all walks of life, from around Australia and the world, who I never would have met in normal circumstances. I had virtually nothing in common with my first and closest friend, a 50-something local government employee, who moved in because he did not want to be locked down alone. He was now working remotely. At night, I’d see him at his laptop in the building’s common area turned co-working space and joke: “These aren’t council hours!” We quickly became mates. I would ramble to him incessantly as he was deep in work about things I knew he had no interest in. He always listened politely. His tolerance of me was not the only lesson in peacekeeping. Another resident was a Canadian Trump supporter and handyman. In theory, we disagreed on absolutely everything, but it never ended up in an argument. When he spotted me, I’d be greeted with observations like, “Guess who’s going out of business – CNN!” He was harmless, more talk than anything. The day another guest called me a city latte type, telling me that he “despised everything about me”, the Canadian came over to me to see if I was all right. The place possessed great secrets. One woman, in her 60s with beautiful olive skin, was always immaculately groomed but wore a slightly pained expression. It was weeks until we got talking and I discovered that, despite her polish, she was receiving treatment for a debilitating brain injury. The hostel was a base for her to be closer to medical facilities. We began to bring each other pastries and coffees, and she invited me to her house “when things got back to normal”. But when would that be? With life so unpredictable now, some people would book accommodation on a “week by week” basis. Each day you’d wonder who would show up, and many guests would leave only to return later. There were “hostel hoppers”, there for the company, who spent most of their time sitting in the common area. I met women experiencing homelessness, who I knew could be me in another life. An ex-prisoner who had completely reformed their life joked that these digs were worse than jail. I became quite fond of them. There was a city professional who, appearing to have sussed out everyone, got dubbed “the reality consultant” by another resident. He was waiting for his apartment to be renovated, but I knew that he secretly liked the social aspect of the hostel. Young teachers and hospitality workers who were having a hard time finding suitable accommodation had also moved in. Meanwhile, the people you’d normally expect to meet – backpackers – were thin on the ground. As I worked on my university studies, it occurred to me this time was like an unintended anthropology lesson or a huge social experiment. While some days were exciting, living with so many different people meant that other days were hard. Sometimes, really late, I would go downstairs to what was once a ballroom and sit there alone, revelling in the space and stillness, but comforted in knowing there were people not far away. Most afternoons after work I went for a long bushwalk, but the interactions in the kitchen were always a bigger adventure. This was particularly true over dinner, when everyone came together. Some of the “long-termers” joked about what to call the place. One likened it to a spaceship. Others called it a nursing home. “A bit like a cruise liner with activities on each day – but going nowhere!” That one brought the house down. Yes, it was like all of those things. But for all of us, during what could have been a time of grim isolation, it was also a lifeline. A home.",Lifestyle/Life and style,I envisaged a two-week visit when I arrived at the youth hostel.

2/6/2022,"The paradox of the oligarchical money that washes around the British elite like a sea of dirty water is that it has yet to buy every aspect of British foreign policy. Opposition politicians and journalists can identify the Kremlin-linked billionaires funding the Tory party. We can look in a mixture of revulsion and astonishment at how the naturally conservative milieu of City financiers, libel lawyers, estate agents, the art market and private schools has become as dependent on the proceeds of crime as opioid addicts on OxyContin. But we cannot say that Vladimir Putin owns this government. The UK supports Ukraine and shows no inclination to excuse Russian imperialism. If you want a truly cynical European power, look to Germany, which would rather see Putin’s armies march into Kyiv than risk Volkswagen losing the sale of a single hatchback.  Domestic, not foreign, policy is corrupted. Your taxes are rising and your public services are failing because a governing elite that is at ease with easy money will not pass laws to drain the money swamp. Because it does not police oligarchs, the government allows every type of fraudster to flourish. The temptation is to focus on a London populated by caricatures out of socialist agitprop. Here we have Ben Elliot, connected to royalty via his Auntie Camilla. Elliot provides “unique access and exclusive privileges” to the super-rich on the one hand and charges Tory donors £250,000 for meetings with Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak on the other. To show you the damage, however, let me take you far from Mayfair to Manchester crown court by the River Irwell, where Judge Anthony Cross stared at Asif Hussain last month and confessed to being staggered. Before him in the dock was the leader of an organised crime gang with 48 convictions on his record who had nevertheless received a £50,000 Covid bounceback loan without anyone in government undertaking “the most basic of checks”. The fraud was not detected because the Treasury stirred itself out of its torpor but because Greater Manchester police uncovered the swindle while investigating a stolen car racket. The pilfered £50,000 was a mere pittance. Thieves helped themselves to at least £5bn of bounceback business loans during the Covid pandemic and that is before you get to furlough and “eat out to help out” scams. More generally, if you are a victim of crime you will in all likelihood be a victim of online fraud. And as the humiliating realisation that you have been conned sinks in, you will also know the police will be unable to do a thing about it. The best guess is that in total the UK loses £190bn a year to fraud while the government spends just £852m fighting it. As with so much else this government does, the policing of fraud looks as if it is twisted for political gain. Students (who generally don’t vote Conservative) face a student loan company with a budget of £200m and 3,000 staff tasked with preventing fake applications. By contrast, Sunak committed just £100m to a taxpayer protection taskforce and employed just 1,200 staff to capture older, white-collar criminals (who tend to be solid Tories and, indeed, the friends of cabinet ministers). You can live a rich, comfortable and undisturbed life in the UK as a native fraudster or migrant oligarch. The secrecy of the financial system hides your assets. You do not have to declare which homes you own. Speaking before the Commons Treasury committee last week, senior staff of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs assured all watching criminals that they had taken a “deliberate decision” to reduce the prosecution of tax fraudsters. Meanwhile, what the Conservative MP Bob Seely nicely described as a “corrupting cottage industry” of law firms and barristers ensures that anyone who raises questions about fraudulently acquired wealth faces libel actions with costs that run to millions. The judges who hear them are not corrupt, but they lack the intellectual capacity to admit that the inordinate costs of the system they serve suit the interests of the wealthy rather than the interests of justice. The magnificently diffident Conservative peer Lord Agnew resigned as the minister responsible for countering fraud last month because “it feels somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role”. Total fraud losses across Whitehall were running at an estimated £29bn a year, he said, while a combination of “arrogance, indolence and ignorance freezes the government machine”. Ask why this arrogant, indolent and ignorant tolerance of fraud has so afflicted the leadership of a Conservative party that preposterously pretends to be the party of law and order as well as the party of sound money. Bear all three in mind while you listen to a clearly panicking Liz Truss as she promises to deliver an economic crime bill that ministers have delayed bringing before parliament for four years. Truss has to look as if the government will act because she told Putin that the UK would impose sanctions on the Russian elite if he invaded Ukraine, a threat that would carry more weight were the UK not a country designed to protect oligarchical wealth. A serious policy response would mean providing the funding to Companies House so it can weed out and prosecute the beneficial owners of the thousands of criminal enterprises it currently covers with a patina of respectability. It would include cleaning up the City, clamping down on corruption in UK-controlled tax havens and stopping the libel courts being used as weapons in asymmetrical warfare by hostile foreign powers. I am happy to be proved wrong, and ministers would have the support of patriotic Conservative MPs if they acted, but I cannot see this government doing it. When (not if) Johnson is thrown out, the odds are that he will look to the oligarchs for easy money, like George Osborne and so many others before him. In Butler to the World, a terrific book out next month, Oliver Bullough describes how the Treasury has always deferred to tax havens, hedge funds, private equity and venture capitalists and opposed any attempt to make fraud harder to perpetrate. It will do so again. Those same financial interests that influence the Treasury supply the Conservative party with donations and personnel. The sea of dirty money is the sea the Conservative leadership swims in. It can no more live outside it than a fish can live on land.

2/6/2022,"Astacia Stevens wanted to drive a haul truck – the giant yellow vehicles that bring ore from the mines – for Rio Tinto, the equally vast company that controls swathes of the iron-rich Pilbara. But, she told a West Australian parliamentary inquiry, her attempts to move from working for a contractor for Rio to working directly for it and wearing the company logo on her shirt were met with a demand from a superior she have sex with him.  The supervisor, who the inquiry gave the code name “A”, “took me off the trucks and took me up to the site lookout in his supervisor vehicle”, Stevens, who now works in an administrative position at Rio, said in a written submission to the parliament. “The lookout is secluded and requires a site pass to access, which A held. At the lookout, whilst in the vehicle, he unzipped his pants and leaned back in his seat. “He was not wearing any underwear and said to me ‘if you want your shirt, you have to get on your knees first’.” She refused, did not get transferred to Rio, and was victimised and fired, she told the inquiry, which is investigating the sexual harassment of women on fly-in-fly-out mine sites. In a report Rio released this week, the company revealed that women who work for it reported 21 incidents of rape, attempted rape or sexual assaults over the past five years. The report, the result of an investigation by the former sex discrimination commissioner Elizabeth Broderick, showed that sexual harassment, bullying and racism is endemic across Rio’s global workforce. It was the latest blow for a company already reeling from its decision in May 2020 to blow up ancient rock shelters at Juukan Gorge, in the Pilbara, in order to mine more iron, the Serbian government’s decision last month to cancel its licence to mine lithium after a community outcry that saw thousands march in the streets, and ongoing controversy over its Oyu Tolgoi project in Mongolia, the cost of which has blown out by billions of dollars after Rio struck a new deal with the government a week ago that it hopes will end a long-running dispute over the country’s share of potential profits from the vast copper deposit. However, the inquiry in WA has shown that Rio is not alone when it comes to failing to provide a workplace free from rape, bullying and harassment. At BHP, in the two years between July 2019 and July 2021, there were 18 cases of rape, attempted rape or what the company called “non-consensual touching of a sexual nature”, the company said in a submission to the inquiry. This included five incidents of rape. Investors, the sex discrimination commissioner and the mining companies themselves say action is needed to curb a culture of sexual assault, sexism, bullying and racism in the industry, especially at mines where workers fly in and out and are often among strangers, far from their homes, friends and family. Debby Blakey, the chief executive of $68bn super fund Hesta, which has been critical of Rio’s management over Juukan Gorge, said Rio had done the right thing by conducting such a comprehensive review and said other mining companies needed to consider whether it was something they should also do. “The findings of the Rio workplace culture report that sexual harassment, racism and bullying were systemic are extremely concerning for investors and potentially point to broader issues across the mining sector,” she said. The sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, said: “A broad shift in the culture of the mining industry is urgently needed.” She said the industry was identified as “an industry that required urgent collective action” in the Australian Human Rights Commission’s 2020 Respect@Work report. “I commend Rio Tinto for taking this important step of gathering evidence, acknowledging its role in the harms of sexual harassment and sexual assault in its workplaces and committing to change,” she said. Rio has pledged to implement 26 recommendations made by Broderick to improve the organisation’s culture and make the workplace safer for the groups she found bore the brunt of bullying and discrimination – women, non-white people and LGBTIQ employees. “The report is absolutely confronting, the stories sickening,” Rio’s head of iron ore, Simon Trott, told ABC Radio this week. “We aspire to be a business where everyone is safe, respectful and included, and clearly the report highlights that bullying, sexual harassment, racism, other forms of disrespect, are … right across Rio’s operations around the world.” BHP and the other big player in the Pilbara, Fortescue – where Astacia Stevens told the WA inquiry she also experienced sexual harassment while driving a haul truck for a contractor – have also said they are moving to eliminate toxic behaviour from their sites. “We know incidents of poor behaviour do occur in our business, as they do in the industry and the community more broadly,” a BHP spokesperson said. “We do not tolerate any form of racism, discrimination, harassment or bullying, and we are absolutely committed to eliminating it from our workplaces. We are making progress but we know we have more to do.” Fortescue’s chief executive, Elizabeth Gaines, who is soon to leave her position as one of the few women who run a big miner, said: “There is no place for harassment of any kind at Fortescue or in any workplace, and we continue to take decisive action to ensure our workplaces are safe for everyone.” The sentiments are noble but it is clear the industry has a long way to go. Broderick found problems across the global Rio workforce, but the mining camps where workers fly or drive in and stay on site were among the worst workplaces, with 56% of women she surveyed who worked at them saying they were bullied and 43% reporting sexual harassment. Women Broderick’s team interviewed who don’t work directly for Rio but are employed by one of the company’s many contractors also said they faced extra abuse. “The shut crew are groping you as you are taking your trolley around the camp,” one cleaner who worked for a Rio contractor told Broderick’s team. “Every day there is sexual harassment to women bar staff,” another said. A separate survey of FIFO workers in WA, conducted by union group the Western Mine Workers Alliance and submitted to the parliamentary inquiry, found 22% of women had been offered career advancement or other work benefits in return for sex and 22.9% had been sexually assaulted at work. “I will not go into the crib room at all,” one female Rio employee who responded to the union survey said. “I bring all my own food. I have experienced and witnessed so much leering and sexual comments. I have seen a man watch porn on bus and plane. I have found porn magazine in a truck. I have had underwear stolen. I have had a male try get into my room.” She said a woman on her crew “was bashed by a male colleague”. Bystanders did not report it, she said. “People were saying she got what she deserved.” All the big miners have systems in place that are supposed to allow employees to make complaints about violence, sexual harassment and bullying and have them resolved in a confidential way. But Broderick’s report and evidence to the parliamentary hearing shows many staff are fearful to speak out and have little faith in company systems. Kerin Collins, who told the inquiry she was bullied while working as an equipment maintenance trainer at BHP, said the company’s complaints system, Ethics Point, was better described as “Ethics Point (Less)” and a “spill kit for complaints” designed to “control, contain, clean up”. “It’s not a place with independent, ethical investigators looking at your complaint and making sure BHP are adhering to their own charter values, it’s just a website being hosted by a third party where you enter data and without any third party interference, the unseen ‘ones and zeros’ go straight into the hands of BHP,” she said in a submission to the inquiry. “Often complaints get handed back to the same leadership team in the same department and they investigate their own leadership personnel.” BHP said that since 2019 allegations of sexual harassment have been investigated by a specialist central team, which is separate from other business units. “This change was introduced in recognition of the need to enhance our investigation processes in order to improve reporting and increase the confidence of, and support for, impacted persons in our investigations,” it said in its submission to the WA inquiry. Broderick found that at Rio, harmful behaviour was tolerated or normalised and “harmful behaviour by serial perpetrators is often an open secret”. “Employees believe that there is little accountability, particularly for senior leaders and so called ‘high performers’ who are perceived to avoid significant consequences for harmful behaviour.” Mick Buchan, the WA secretary of the CFMEU, blamed many of the cultural problems at FIFO sites across the industry on the practice of “motelling” or “hot-bedding”, where employees do not have the same room for the duration of their work on site but are moved around so that the company uses space as efficiently as possible. “A huge step would be to go back to that community feel where once you land on a job, you stay in that room for the duration of that job so you can build up your own community,” he told the WA inquiry. He also attacked the increased use of labour hire and contractors, saying mining companies were using them to relieve themselves of their responsibilities. “You have got to the point now where some of them start up their own labour hire companies and some elements, so you may get to wear the shirt, but you do not get all the benefits,” he said. “You can be let go in a text message with a day’s notice on either side, so it puts all that extra pressure on you if you have got an issue, whether it be a safety issue or anything, to just keep your mouth shut and just do what you are there to do.” The weight of evidence has forced mining companies to take action that so far includes reducing the amount of alcohol available at FIFO camps, increasing security measures, beefing up complaints investigation and giving managers more training. But companies also need to abandon a culture of secrecy, Jenkins said. Already, both Rio and BHP have ruled out using non-disclosure agreements to gag victims of assault or harassment from speaking out after negotiating a settlement with the company. “Rio Tinto commissioning and publishing the results of its review is a significant shift from the common approach of denial, secrecy, and lack of proactive action that we identified for many Australian workplaces as a barrier to safety and respect,” Jenkins said. “I have consistently said that the focus of employers should be to stop sexual harassment, rather than to stop complaints and media reporting of sexual harassment. This is the mindset shift required from all employers.”",News/Australia news,‘Absolutely confronting’: the sickening stories of sexual harassment of women in mining,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/06/absolutely-confronting-the-sickening-stories-of-sexual-harassment-of-women-in-mining
2/6/2022,"Iread somewhere that our relationship with the ocean is a reflection of how we see ourselves. Which makes sense because growing up I saw the moana as just a body of water. Nothing special. And sadly, that’s how I saw myself. I am a descendant of Ngāpuhi and grew up in Te Tai Tokerau with Waipu beach at my doorstep. I spent hours on the boat out at Langs beach, taking day trips as a child to Ninety Mile beach, the Hokianga, Cape Reinga and all the untamed places my ancestors landed on when they first arrived in Aotearoa.  Despite being surrounded by oceans of water growing up, the moana was just somewhere I went to because Mum forced me. Mum said I almost drowned a few times so maybe that’s got something to do with it. I hated the feeling of being cold, of being smashed around by the waves and feeling unsafe. My relationship with the moana began to change as my relationship with myself became more defined. Last year I undertook a full-immersion te reo Māori course and it was the hardest year of my life. I began to unravel hidden parts of myself that I didn’t know existed through learning a language beaten from my ancestors. Emotions began to surface that felt beyond my control and I would hear the whispering to go to the moana. At the time, I couldn’t understand why. I live 40 minutes from Piha beach and it was the middle of winter. It didn’t make sense. I listened to the promptings, jumped in my car, and the rain pounded on the windscreen as I drove to what became my āhuru mōwai – my safe haven. It’s strange to think that despite growing up around the moana and being spoiled with choice, it was a black sand beach tucked away in Waitakere that became my favourite wild place in Aotearoa. You drive along the windy roads, get around the bend and see the cliff-top view of the ocean, and you breathe in the sight and say “woah” to yourself even though you’ve seen it many times. You pull up to the car park and there’s the rock that looks like a lion that reminds you Piha is wild and dangerous and there have been many deaths. The waves are imposing and the rips will get you if you’re not careful. The first time last year I went to Piha, it was pouring down with rain. Tangaroa is the God of the Moana and he is very much a life force. I said a karakia to him and dived into the water. When I came out of the moana, I felt light and connected. It was Tangaroa rejuvenating my spirit. I learnt that when you swim in the moana, you’re surrounded by his love. He caught my hopes and dreams and swept away my tears all at the same time. As the challenges of learning te reo Māori came, I escaped to Piha and gave it all to Tangaroa. It soon became a regular routine. It didn’t matter what emotions I was feeling or what I was going through, Tangaroa seemed to understand me. And slowly, my view of myself began to change. This year I didn’t just reclaim my language – I reclaimed my relationship with myself through the moana. Piha beach is rugged and moody and beautiful and imperfect. It is also a taonga (treasure). And that’s how I see myself now. There’s nowhere else in the world like it.

2/6/2022,"It’s been called a “flawed” project by the productivity commission. It still has no business case or environmental approval and it’s already doubled in cost before construction can begin. But this week the deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, announced the Dungowan dam near Tamworth was “moving ahead”.  Together with the New South Wales water minister, Kevin Anderson, Joyce travelled to the old dam to announce the project – one of the biggest water infrastructure projects in the last two decades – again. “Today we’re here at the site of the existing Dungowan dam to announce real progress on this important piece of water infrastructure,” Joyce said. “I’ve never stopped fighting for this project, and this is a big step towards securing water security for Tamworth for years to come.” Anderson said, “Since I have taken up the responsibility of minister for lands and water, I have been pushing hard to get this project moving, to get shovels in the ground, and I believe significant progress has been made in regard to the new Dungowan Dam.” The “progress”, announced in a National party media release rather than a government one, is that a final business case “has been lodged with Infrastructure NSW and Infrastructure Australia”, and that it would be considered by the NSW government in the next month. There is also a shortlist of two contractors, even though the project is yet to clear environmental hurdles and remains only part-funded. However, the much-awaited business case, which will help Tamworth residents and farmers understand what this new dam might mean for the cost of water, will not be made public. A spokesperson for the NSW department of primary industries later clarified that the business case will not be made public “because it includes cabinet and commercially sensitive information.” “It is common practice for the NSW government not to publicly release entire final business cases as they include commercial in confidence information. However, the EIS (environmental impact statement, which contains elements of the final business case) will be publicly exhibited before the end of 2022,” the spokesperson said. The project is one of a suite of contentious dam projects that have been pushed by the NSW Nationals and which the federal government has agreed to fund 50-50. Two of these – Mole Creek dam and Wyangala dam are now on the backburner – after massive cost blowouts. Dungowan dam, however has survived despite documents obtained during a NSW upper house inquiry showing it too has almost doubled in cost from $484m to $870m by November 2020 and that further budget allocations would be needed from both NSW and the federal government to cover the new hefty price tag. The project has strong National party support and even scored a brief visit from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, during the 2019 federal election campaign. For some of the decision makers, the project is very close to home. The dam is located in Joyce’s federal seat of New England and Anderson’s state seat of Tamworth. The chairman of Infrastructure Australia, which comes under Joyce’s portfolio, and who will consider the adequacy of the business case for the project, is former Tamworth mayor, Col Murray. The project to build a new dam downstream from the old Dungowan dam and a new pipeline to the water treatment works was originally proposed because of fears the growing town of Tamworth will run short of water. The town has an allocation from Dungowan, but the lion’s share of water from the dam is used for irrigation and farming. Critics, including the federal government’s productivity commission argue that Tamworth’s future needs could be met by spending just $10m on buying back water entitlements from irrigators. In a scathing assessment in its paper on national water policy, released in 2021, the commission said the proposed dam was a “costly way” to deliver more water to Tamworth. It said the government had failed to consider non-dam options to boost water supply to the area in the original feasibility study, such as water buybacks or investment in water efficiency. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “Unless governments recover the cost of major water infrastructure from users, funding major water infrastructure for the benefit of primary industries would amount to subsidising a commercial operation,” the report warns. The commission estimated authorities will get just $11m a year back on their investment which is now likely to be closer to $1bn. The Dungowan project was originally being run by WaterNSW, which, as a state-owned enterprise, has a mandate to deliver a commercial return to the NSW government. Last year the NSW government quietly moved major water projects back inside the department to “Water Infrastructure” after WaterNSW warned the three proposed dam projects were not viable and would require a budget subsidy or a waiver from its charter. Greens NSW Upper House MP, Cate Faehrmann who chaired an inquiry into NSW dam projects, vowed to ensure that the business case for Dungowan dam would be made public. Her inquiry called on the government to consider other alternatives to boosting Tamworth’s water supply such as managed recharge of aquifers in the area and water efficiency projects. The report pointed out that the project’s proponents had failed to take account of climate change when considering the merits of a bigger dam. The Nature Conservation Council said it was appalling the public would only have access to selected excerpts of the business case. “The government is treating the public like mushrooms – keeping them in the dark and feeding them the bare minimum,” the council’s acting chief executive, Jacqui Mumford, said. In 2020 WaterNSW, which was then in charge of the process, said many of the questions about the dams could be answered once the business cases were complete. “Work on the development of the proposed Dungowan dam is only in its early stages,” a spokesperson said. “Estimates of the practical benefits and additional availability of water for the community of Tamworth will be clearer once the final business case is complete in 2021.” The spokesperson for the NSW department said the EIS, which will be released by the end of 2022 would now provide more limited financial information. “The EIS process allows the community to have their say on the project via public submissions. It also provides transparency to the community without disclosing cabinet and commercially sensitive information.”",News/Australia news,"Dungowan dam doubles in projected costs, has no business case, no environmental approval yet is ‘moving ahead’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/06/dungowan-dam-doubles-in-projected-costs-has-no-business-case-no-environmental-approval-yet-is-moving-ahead
