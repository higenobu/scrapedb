12/26/2021,"You could easily arrive at the conclusion that Patrick Cummins had been blessed by some benevolent god. The best-on-ground performance in the teenage Test debut, the personal qualities that made people speak of him as a future captain, the rise to that position despite a century and more of entrenched Australian opposition to bowlers taking the job.  That interpretation though would be overlooking the long, long wait after that teenage beginning, when Cummins had played one Test but spent six years being denied the next, the cycle of injuries whirring as endlessly as the exercise bikes on which he did another stint of rehabilitation. Your early 20s are supposed to be a time of impulsiveness and expression, not of quiet dedication to a long-term goal. Having observed that discipline though, an age of karmic benevolence towards Cummins resumed. Almost free of injury since his Test return in 2017, he has continued rising and rising in the ranks of world players and the estimation of those watching. As it seems, even his Covid suspension from the second Test of this series has worked out, giving him a break in a packed series without the angst and argument that would otherwise have surrounded resting the Test captain. Twice in previous Ashes series, Cummins has got through all five Tests, but none had such short turnarounds between matches across the whole series. On his return on the first morning of the Boxing Day Test, Cummins looked every bit the better for his break. He stood by while Joe Root called the coin incorrectly, chose to bowl first on a cool cloudy morning that had just seen its last shower of rain, and immediately, immaculately locked onto an off-stump line with enough seam movement to threaten. Like any good mob boss, Cummins doesn’t make threats that he isn’t prepared to carry out. Haseeb Hameed has shown moments of composure to the adherents and moments of weakness to the doubters, but his dismissal in the first over gave nothing to either, playing a line that he had no choice but to play, left by seam and bounce that took the edge. Bounce too did for Zak Crawley, returning to the team, slicing from the shoulder of the bat to gully as he tried to nudge leg side, an innings of 12 runs in a year in which he has averaged 11.2. Then another perfect line, adjusted for a left-hander, took out Dawid Malan while his toasted cheese sandwich was being readied on the grill, ending the only partnership that has offered England any stability in this series. In that first session, Australia’s other bowlers had been manageable. Mitchell Starc looked for swing, found none, and wandered down the leg side, taken off after three overs. Scott Boland on debut was accurate and serviceable, while Cameron Green and Nathan Lyon both had a bowl without much effect. Had the attack been rounded out by someone other than Cummins, England might have got through. The middle session might have become a parade of batting incompetence, but it was the opening session, against his quality, when they were undone. All of the above was received with relish by a sizeable Melbourne crowd. The MCG’s usual Ashes threshold of 90,000 shrank this year to just over 57,000, not by any government mandate but by the choice of people to stay away during another pandemic surge. It was still a crowd that would dwarf most in world cricket, but a reduction reflecting a city that remains battered and wary after a difficult couple of years. A bit like Cummins, Melbourne has been extremely fortunate, in a way that doesn’t discount its own particular privations. Pandemic death rates have been low, vaccination rates are high, and this balance of elements was hard won by the long lockdowns that forestalled one while enabling the other. With isolation not required since October, the people like those who filled the stands today have been happy to burst back into the world. Those who left them empty remain cautious of the twists that this story could yet take. Which added some poignancy at the MCG, especially from a hometown perspective. There were crowd roars and circular waves and some all-time incompetence from a pitch invader. There were beach balls and beers. And there were absences. An atmosphere ebullient, but less than it might have been. A celebration, against a well-founded background hum of anxiety. Trying to congregate in the way of the recent past felt like trying to claim closure for something that is not yet done. The tranches of empty seats told that story without a noise. Still, in some ways the rituals of a Boxing Day felt important. The early burst of rain, the cold delay. The gradual gentling of a day into something approaching pleasantness. The packed lunches and the shouted greetings. And there were the strange new things, like a fast-bowling captain throwing himself the ball for one more quick burst before the lunch break. Knocking through England’s only partnership of resistance. Showing us someone for who, at least for the moment, most things keep going very right.",Sport/Sport,Return of heaven-sent Cummins is perfect late gift for Australia’s attack,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/dec/26/return-of-heaven-sent-cummins-is-perfect-late-gift-for-australia-attack-mcg-boxing-day-test
12/26/2021,"There is fog but not much filthy air to be found in Joel Coen’s bright, clean, stripped-down Shakespeare adaptation. Directing for the first time without his brother and regular collaborator Ethan, Coen casts Denzel Washington and Frances McDormand as the scheming, murderous couple seeking to secure the Scottish throne.  The film has a cold, abstract beauty. The castle is a marvel of brutalist architecture, while Bruno Delbonnel’s stark black-and-white cinematography emphasises the set’s harsh lines and shadows. The three witches who prophesy Macbeth’s fate are reimagined as one “weird sister”. She is played by the acclaimed stage actor Kathryn Hunter, who snaps, twists and contorts her body to terrifying, memorable effect. The other performances feel more muted. Washington has a natural authority that lends itself to the role, but McDormand is vacant and glassy-eyed. Both should be bloodthirsty, yet instead are bloodless – too measured to match the mania of the source text. In cinemas now and on Apple TV+ from 14 January",Arts/Film,The Tragedy of Macbeth review – Joel Coen’s stripped-down version is beautiful but bloodless,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/dec/26/the-tragedy-of-macbeth-review-joel-coen-denzel-washington-frances-mcdormand-kathryn-hunter
12/26/2021,"It’s getting quite hard to ignore the fact that publishers are increasingly hunting in packs, seemingly driven more by trends than by taste. Next year’s nonfiction lists are dominated to an almost ridiculous degree by books about identity and, perhaps more surprisingly, by essay collections, and the result, seen from afar, is both repetitive and a touch flimsy-seeming (great as it is that publishers are suddenly mad for essays, this is a form that requires a lot of craft and deep thinking even to be half successful). Meanwhile, pitiful neglect sets in elsewhere. If nature writing is (at last, some might say) in retreat, thunking great literary biographies are positively on the run, though we can, I’m happy to say, look forward to Katherine Rundell’s Super-infinite: The Transformations of John Donne (Faber, April), a new and groovy-sounding account of the life of the great poet of sex and death. Ah, yes: death. Grief is big business for publishing, an industry all of its own. In The Reactor: A Book About Grief and Repair (Faber, January), Nick Blackburn, a psychotherapist, worries away in modish fragmentary style at the sudden loss of his father. In This Mortal Coil: A History of Death (Bloomsbury, February), the historian Andrew Doig offers a portrait of the final exit across the centuries. Naturally, illness is all around, too. Those who have found Professor Devi Sridhar’s expertise and calm advice invaluable since the arrival of Covid-19 will be glad to know that she has written Preventable: the Politics of Pandemics and How to Stop the Next One (Viking, May). More cheerily, Gavin Francis, the Edinburgh GP who wrote so well on the pandemic last year, has now switched his attention – put the Lucozade on ice! – to life after illness in Recovery: The Lost Art of Convalescence (Wellcome Collection, January).  A couple of books about art. In Bacon in Moscow (Profile, January), James Birch relives his comical/somewhat terrifying attempts to mount a retrospective of the artist in the USSR in 1988 (think dodgy attaches and KGB honey traps); Grayson Perry calls it “rollocking”. I’m also looking forward to The Real and the Romantic: English Art Between Two World Wars (Thames and Hudson, April) by Francis Spalding, biographer of Vanessa Bell and John Minton. In pop and rock, White Rabbit, still a new imprint, is showing how it’s done: so many women’s voices. Next year, it will publish The Sound of Being Human by Jude Rogers (April), a memoir, shaped around 12 songs, which looks at why music plays such a profound role in our lives; and Wayward: Just Another Life to Live (April), the singer songwriter Vashti Bunyan’s account of how she came to record the album Just Another Diamond Day, ignored on its release in 1970, but adored on its rediscovery 30 years later. However, I’m reserving my greatest excitement for Sound Within Sound: Opening Our Ears to the Twentieth Century (Faber, July), in which Kate Molleson, the Radio 3 presenter, will tell the story of 10 radicals who dared to challenge the conventions of classical music. A book that seems likely to prick even the most jaded ears. Under “fascinating and uncategorisable”, let’s file The Stasi Poetry Circle by Philip Oltermann (Faber, February) and The Premonitions Bureau by Sam Knight (also Faber, May). In the former, Oltermann tells the story of an experiment in weaponising poetry for politics that began in 1982 when East Germany’s secret police, convinced writers were embedding subversive messages in their work, decided to train border guards in the art of lyrical verse. In the latter, Knight goes back to 1966, when a British psychiatrist called John Barker began to investigate whether some people’s premonitions should be taken seriously in the hope of avoiding national disasters. Anyone who has ever wondered about the camp on the Isle of Man where Britain interned 30,000 German and Austrian refugees during the second world war, among them the artist Kurt Schwitters, will be keen to get hold of The Island of Extraordinary Captives (Sceptre, February) by Simon Parkin. Also heading our way, somewhat belatedly, is An Accidental Icon (Hodder, April), Norman Scott’s account of his relationship with the Liberal politician Jeremy Thorpe; thanks to the BBC hit A Very English Scandal, in which he was played by Ben Whishaw, Scott’s story may draw the attention even of those who weren’t there at the time. Finally, some memoirs. Back in the Day (Sceptre, May) is Melvyn Bragg’s first; it is about his life from the age of six to 18. In Good Pop, Bad Pop (Cape, May), Jarvis Cocker will give us, we are told, not a life story so much as a “loft story” (his book is inspired by jumble found in his attic: a Gold Star polycotton shirt, a pack of Wrigley’s Extra, several pairs of broken glasses). Hamish Hamilton will also put back into print A Black Boy at Eton (February) by the Nigerian writer Dillibe Onyeama, with an introduction by Bernardine Evaristo (the book belongs to a series, Black Britain: Writing Back, whose titles she has chosen for the imprint). Written when Onyeama was just 21, it is an account of the racism he endured in the mid-60s as only the second black student in Eton’s history. “It wouldn’t let me go,” says Evaristo of a text that in 2020 resulted in an apology to its author from the school’s headteacher.",Arts/Books,Nonfiction to look out for in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/26/nonfiction-to-look-out-for-in-2022
12/26/2021,"Whether it’s a hangover from a pandemic-disrupted few years, a sign that writers had particularly productive lockdowns, or perhaps it’s the many centenaries coming up – Ulysses, The Waste Land and Jacob’s Room – but 2022 is positively groaning with great novels. We’ll leave the Observer’s peerless debut feature to cover new novels from the UK and largely focus on books published in the first half of the year. Prepare your hearts, for Douglas Stuart is back. After the extraordinary success of Shuggie Bain, his second novel, Young Mungo (Picador, April), is another beautiful and moving book, a gay Romeo and Juliet set in the brutal world of Glasgow’s housing estates. Also following up a painfully affecting predecessor is Hanya Yanagihara, whose To Paradise (Macmillan, January) gives us three stories far apart in space and time but each unique in their power to summon the joy and complexity of love, the pain of loss. I’m not sure I’ve ever missed the world of a book as much as I miss To Paradise now I’ve left it. A new Kamila Shamsie novel is always worth celebrating, but Best of Friends (Bloomsbury, October) is something else: an epic story that explores the ties of childhood friendship, the possibility of escape, the way the political world intrudes into the personal, all through the lens of two sharply drawn protagonists.  Tilted Axis Press is the home of some of the most incandescent and urgent writing from all corners of the globe. I’d never heard of Monique Ilboudo, who manages to be both Burkina Faso’s ambassador to Scandinavia and a prolific author. So Distant From My Life (September) is the story of Jeanphi, a young man from the fictional west African city of Ouabany. It’s beautifully translated by Yarri Kamara and the best book about the hope and despair of the migrant experience that I’ve read. NoViolet Bulawayo’s second novel, Glory (Viking, March), is set in the fictional state of Jidada. Here the “Father of the Nation” – an old horse – rules over the other farm animals, who narrate the tale. Robert Mugabe is there in all but name in this striking allegory – an Animal Farm that shows how narratives of liberation and self-determination curdle under a dictator’s power. There’s another very different Africa in Marlon James’s Moon Witch, Spider King (Penguin, March), the second in his Dark Star trilogy. Even more gripping and inventive than its predecessor, the story of the 177-year-old witch Sogolon is like Tolkien on ayahuasca. Two debuts from the States worth looking out for. The Immortal King Rao by Vauhini Vara (Grove Press, June) is a brilliant and beautifully written book about capitalism and the patriarchy, about Dalit India and digital America, about power and family and love. Honorée Fanonne Jeffers is a celebrated poet, but The Love Songs of WEB Du Bois (HarperCollins, January) is her first novel, and what a novel it is. Stretching across generations, it charts the history of an African American family from slavery to the present, all centred on (another) fictional city: Chicasetta, Georgia. Akwaeke Emezi’s debut, Freshwater, announced them as an explosive new voice in 2018. That they are already on to their seventh book – and this at the age of 34 – shows the frantic energy of their work, the range of their vision. Their third adult novel, You Made a Fool of Death With Your Beauty (Faber, May), is the story of Feyi, an artist, and her best friend, Joy. It follows Feyi through a wild summer of creation and destruction, art and music, and lots of sex. Is Deesha Philyaw’s The Secret Lives of Church Ladies (Pushkin Press, May) a novel? Is it a collection of linked stories? Whatever it is, it’s glorious – the smart, sad and very funny portrait of several generations wrestling with their desires and their faith. Jessica Andrews’s first novel, Saltwater, was wonderful. The follow-up, Milk Teeth (Hodder, July), is even better. A story of young love and desire that’s full of the most gorgeous writing. Alex Pheby’s Mordew was a stunning success for the dependably brilliant Galley Beggar Press. Now he follows it up with another super-smart piece of literary fantasy, Malarkoi (August), set amid the ruins of Mordew and with the protagonist of the first novel, Nathan Treeves, dead. I love Sandra Newman’s work and the news that she is currently writing Julia, a feminist retelling of Nineteen Eighty-Four, has got me very excited. Before that, though, is The Men (Granta, June), a dazzling work of speculative fiction that imagines a world in which all men, overnight, vanish from the Earth. Monica Ali’s long-awaited fifth novel, Love Marriage (February, Hachette), was worth the decade it took to arrive. The sharp and independent Yasmin Ghorami is set to marry Joe Sangster, the rakish son of a prominent feminist. This is a proper family saga, both deliciously old-fashioned and full of surprising reversals. Patrick Gale’s latest, Mother’s Boy (March, Headline), delivers a characteristically poised and tender novel about a young man growing up in the shadow of one war and the whispers of the next, with his mother, the indomitable Laura, always there watching over him. A few final books to look forward to… Guardian football journalist Jonathan Wilson has written a smart and cinematic novella, Streltsov (Blizzard Media, January) about the Soviet football star Eduard Streltsov, arrested on the eve of the 1958 World Cup. If you’re looking for this century’s Ulysses, look no further than Patrick McCabe’s Poguemahone (Unbound, April), a stunningly lyrical novel in free verse that takes place in Margate and in the mind and memories of Dan and Una Fogarty. It may look like a chore at more than 600 pages, but it’s a blast. Perhaps better known until now for her short stories, in These Days (Faber, March) Lucy Caldwell has written a novel of enormous heart; full of luminous passages of prose, this tale of the Belfast blitz is breathtakingly good. Finally, there’s Karen Campbell’s Paper Cup (Canongate, June), the story of a homeless woman making her way across Scotland to return a lost engagement ring. It’s magnificent and devastating and I’m welling up just writing about it.",Arts/Books,Fiction to look out for in 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/dec/26/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2022
12/26/2021,"This was the year of the great exhibition – in spite of the plague. Galleries offered online shows when they couldn’t open and riches when they could, no matter the havoc of cancelled loans, insurance hikes and unreliable transport. Schedules were dextrously shifted and blockbusters extended, so judiciously that Tate shows ran longer and the Royal Academy’s magnificent Late Constable continues straight through until next year. Still, one curator confided, 2021 was like playing poker while also juggling eggs. Terrific surveys of female artists continued apace, though still not fast enough to make up for lost time. The wild and stirring genius of the Scottish painter Joan Eardley was celebrated in multiple centenary shows across Scotland. Swiss modernist Sophie Taeuber-Arp’s graphic wit and versatility of needle, pen and paintbrush dazzled at Tate Modern. There were lifetime commemorations of Barbara Hepworth in Wakefield, Eileen Agar at the Whitechapel, Laura Knight at Milton Keynes (still on, until 20 Feb) and US abstract expressionist Helen Frankenthaler at Dulwich – her visions diaphanous as mist, frequently vast, yet miraculously achieved through hard-line woodcut.  By general consent, Yinka Shonibare brought the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition to exhilarating new life with outstanding works by black artists. And 2021 felt at least fractionally more diverse, with riveting solo shows from Charles Gaines, Michael Armitage and Samson Kambalu, Joy Labinjo and Sonia Boyce in public spaces, Carrie Mae Weems in Cardiff, whose photographs could be seen outdoors during lockdown, and every single one of the 40 and more contributors to Life Between Islands, seven decades of British Caribbean art at Tate Britain, so mind-altering I will never forget it. This was the show of the year for me. Painting soared, and was everywhere. People muttered that it was safer than installation or event art, say, during a pandemic (though that didn’t stop Yayoi Kusama’s mirror-upon-mirror Infinity Rooms from selling out at Tate Modern). Ralph Rugoff’s Mixing It Up: Painting Today offered an enthralling overview of what he called “one of the three best painting scenes in the world right now” – namely ours. His Hayward Gallery show offered an astounding range of UK-based artists – Lisa Brice, Matthew Krishanu, Vivien Zhang, rising stars Mohammed Sami and Kudzanai-Violet Hwami – almost all of them born elsewhere. Yet another irreducible argument, were it necessary, for freedom of movement. Many venerable artists died in 2021. There will be no more work from Christian Boltanski, Chuck Close, Lawrence Weiner or the Lebanese painter and poet Etel Adnan, who died at the age of 96. Her life lesson was radiantly simple: “When I paint, I am happy.” The tragic death of Tate Modern’s internationally admired head of exhibitions, Achim Borchardt-Hume, whose shows included the incomparable Picasso: 1932, was announced last month. He was 56. Memories of his acclaimed shows survive him. The Courtauld Gallery reopened after several years – clarified, beautified, masterpieces newly cleaned, the staging a sequence of surprises. So did Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery, expanding to incorporate a whole double-height warehouse. The south-west acquired a new museum with the Box in Plymouth, opening with a show of Australian art. Bournemouth got the art gallery Giant, where Debenhams once stood. You can now see the YBAs beside the seaside. Art can take you anywhere – and this year it did. To the Middle East in the V&A’s Epic Iran, to Australia at Tate Modern (until Autumn 2022), and to Peru (until 22 Feb), Nero’s Ancient Rome and Hokusai’s Japan in the wondrous The Great Picture Book of Everything (ends 30 Jan), all at the British Museum. Art – international, intimate – embraced us into the world again this year, when that world felt remote. For this, and all else, I am so grateful. 1.

12/26/2021,"One way to understand Richard Rogers is as a man who wanted everything. He wanted beautiful new buildings, a fair and civilised society and success for himself and his friends and collaborators. He was generous and tough, romantic and political. He wanted to be in the middle of it all. Such wishes made for a lifetime of majestic achievement, an impact as great as any British architect has ever made. Two documents from his early life sum him up. When he was born, his cousin Ernesto Rogers, a fine Milanese architect, wrote him a letter: don’t eavesdrop behind the door of life, it advised, break through it. As a student at the Architectural Association in London, R got a damning report from one of his teachers. His drawing was bad, it said, his method of work chaotic, his critical judgment inarticulate.  He did indeed break the door open. The AA report was also largely true. His genius was to overcome his weaknesses with charm, charisma and determination, and to ally himself with other brilliant people who could do what he couldn’t. His early architectural career was in the partnership of Team 4, with Norman Foster, Foster’s wife, Wendy Cheeseman, and Rogers’s wife, Su, all of whom had skills that he lacked. He designed the Pompidou Centre in Paris with Renzo Piano and an array of other talents. With his second wife, Ruth, Rogers created a social universe around the River Café restaurant, which started as a canteen for his practice, and the triple-height living space of the home they made by knocking two Chelsea townhouses together. An enduring image of Rogers is of him in a cerise or lime-green shirt, standing on the house’s elegant steel staircase, with Andy Warhol prints of Chairman Mao on the walls, making a gracious if slightly incoherent speech to a party that might include a Hollywood star, a cultured footballer or a world-famous artist. With his omnivorous desire went an obliviousness to contradiction, complexity and the obstinacy of facts. This can be seen in an early house that he and Su designed for the photographer Humphrey Spender; enthralled by the steel-and-glass “case study” houses of California, Rogers wanted to achieve the same in rural Essex, without much allowance for differences in climate. In his first winter in the house, Spender sent Rogers a wry Christmas card, a photograph of the frost patterns that formed on the inside of the single-glazed walls. The same obliviousness could be seen in Rogers’s work with Tony Blair, John Prescott and Ken Livingstone to revitalise British cities with the help of good design. This achieved a true transformation of political and cultural attitudes to urban life, but it also entailed accommodations with property interests at odds with the inclusive principles he championed. There could be conflicts of interest between Rogers the social campaigner and Rogers the leader of an ambitious practice: “good design” too often turned out to mean the high-tech style that he and his allies offered. At worst, the results would be something like One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, a block of super-luxury flats with fortress-like security systems that gives nothing very much to the public realm around it. He could be ruthless in getting his way. Often, his projects didn’t work out as advertised or came at considerable cost to his clients. He successfully wielded the power of British libel laws against the American author Stewart Brand, whose book How Buildings Learn had, in its US edition, challenged the claims of Rogers’s designs to be flexible and adaptable. In the UK version, as if in a Soviet retouched photograph, these sections were replaced by something altogether else. My relationship with Rogers was often spiky. I criticised projects such as his plan to envelop London’s Southbank arts centre with a giant glass roof, with perhaps excessive iconoclastic rage. To which he didn’t take kindly. And yet news of his death, at the age of 88, hit me hard. His courage was phenomenal. And he was, in the end, one of the good guys. The Pompidou Centre, half a century after its inception, remains a blast of joy, energy and invention in the heart of a historic city. Even clients he nearly bankrupted, even Spender with his freezing house, were won over by the power of his vision. “Naivety is an important part of creativity,” Rogers told his partner, Graham Stirk. In the case of this particular architectural giant, you couldn’t get one without the other.",Arts/Art and design,"‘A blast of joy, energy and invention’ – in praise of Richard Rogers",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2021/dec/26/a-blast-of-joy-energy-and-invention-richard-rogers-tribute-rowan-moore
12/26/2021,"Theatre is directly vulnerable to the moment in which it happens, and this can give it extra edge. In London, with many theatres closing as Omicron calls the shots, it was touch and go as to whether Spring Awakening would be put on hold. This is a multiple Tony award-winning rock musical, first performed in 2006, with music by Duncan Sheik and lyrics by Steven Sater, based on Frank Wedekind’s cause célèbre of an expressionist 1891 play. And when the first night did go ahead, before some subsequent performances were halted, it was as thrillingly charged as if it were the young cast’s last night on Earth – or on stage (many actors are recent drama school graduates). It was an evening of such unparalleled dynamism that it has left me holding superlatives up to the light, wondering which, if any, could possibly begin to live up to this production. The Almeida’s artistic director, Rupert Goold, and designer Miriam Buether have created a dark world in which spring shows no sign of awakening and adults have the potential to nip young souls in the bud. Steps rake steeply up to the back of the stage and double as slates for luminous chalked scribblings that change with the scenes as they shift between classroom, forest and graveyard. In contrast to their oppressive surroundings, the teenagers are primed to break free, aided and abetted by Lynne Page’s breathtaking choreography – flights of imagination that exploit the set. In a magically improbable moment, two boys, Hänschen (Nathan Armarkwei-Laryea) and Ernst (Zheng Xi Yong), slide slowly downstairs on their backs, hand-in-hand, head first: falling in love has never been more physically precise.  But the musical begins with a lesson overseen by a sadistic Latin master (the admirably unhackneyed Mark Lockyer). Latin is mandatory but sex education fatally withheld, and Catherine Cusack plays a suitably severe matriarch of misinformation. The teenagers and their music are driven by an erotic energy that does – and does not – know where to go. Laurie Kynaston’s Melchior has a compelling intensity in his high-necked, double-breasted attire – a childish rig he has outgrown along with his childhood. He is a clever boy whose cleverness puts him at risk: he composes a 10-page essay on the facts of life to assist Moritz, his bemused friend. Moritz’s emotions prove precarious, and Stuart Thompson is heartbreaking in the role: it is fascinating to observe the nuanced fluctuation between the child he was and the adult he dare not become. Amara Okereke plays Wendla – with whom Melchior has his first doomed experience of sex – with core stillness and a marvellous singing voice. And the diverse supporting cast shows that each adolescent journey is different yet the same. Asha Banks, Taylor Bradshaw, Carly-Sophia Davies, Kit Esuruoso, Bella Maclean, Emily Ooi, Joe Pitts, Maia Tamrakar – it is a register of brilliance, the classiest of classes. But the production’s most striking achievement is in its containing of the uncontainable, especially during songs intent on bringing the house down. The power is in seizing the moment beyond the musical itself, using it to express defiance at the crushing effect on young people of nearly two years of pandemic. Elegy and rebellion become interchangeable. Rage deepens the mix. And when the cast comes together to sing Totally Fucked, it seems like an outlet for all the pain, frustration and subjugation of the past two years. A Covid generation expressing itself in an unforgettable blast of energy. Alan Plater’s Peggy for You, first performed in 2000, is about the legendary theatrical agent Peggy Ramsay, who represented playwrights from Alan Ayckbourn to David Hare to Plater himself – plus scores of distinguished others. It is expertly crafted, lightly entertaining and an ideal vehicle for Tamsin Greig’s comic talent – no one could play Peggy better. She is first sighted reclining on her couch, peering myopically at manuscripts. Her voice is as languorous as she is. She is syrup one moment, acid the next. Ramsay’s eccentricity is beautifully captured: she might seem distrait, but her concentration on the submissions she rejects is devastatingly focused. She tiptoes about in stockinged feet, a law unto herself. She calls everyone “dear” but is capable of putdowns such as: “You have set new standards for impertinence.” I’d have been interested in a more serious exploration of how Ramsay’s theatrical judgment evolved, but Plater, perhaps understandably, never strays from entertainment into documentary. Peggy’s visitors include Simon from Crouch End (nicely played by Josh Finan), a wannabe writer whose dazed gormlessness does not obscure his intelligence; Henry (plausible Trevor Fox), an established but aggrieved writer from Newcastle; and the strangely slow and mannered Jos Vantyler as Philip – a successful playwright, practised at uncorking champagne, for whom literary success is like attending a wedding. This affectionate piece is adroitly directed by Richard Wilson but is such a safe choice that it proves dangerous, for although it passes the time amusingly enough, it has nothing to say to our present moment. I wonder if Peggy Ramsay saw Habeas Corpus (first performed in 1973) and what she thought of it. Alan Bennett was not one of her Alans, although she made a cameo appearance in his 2007 film Prick Up Your Ears, played by Vanessa Redgrave. Habeas Corpus is another period piece, a lurching return to the 70s: a farce without furniture (unless you count the coffin). It involves two lecherous doctors, a lascivious vicar and several undercharacterised women. Jasper Britton is a wearily urbane Dr Arthur Wicksteed, with a suspect bedside manner. Catherine Russell is superbly blousy as Muriel, his large, sad and garrulous wife. Thomas Josling, making his debut, is striking as their son Dennis, a hectic hypochondriac with acne. Kirsty Besterman plays the “spinster” sister, Constance, as a feverish drip in pursuit of an enhanced bosom and a husband. Matthew Cottle is spot-on as Canon Throbbing, the vicar with chaste countenance, lewd intentions and flashing blue eyes. And Kate Bernstein scores high as sexy Felicity: all pout and doubt. Abdul Salis rallies in the unenviable role of Mr Shanks, false breast salesman, while Ria Jones strives to hold the tedious story together as Mrs Swabb, who narrates while vacuuming (a role once played by Bennett himself). You might think that comedy should have no sell-by date, but this play turns out to have expired. Patrick Marber directs and was, apparently, taken by its mix of dark and light (the play alludes as much to death as sex). But Bennett’s melancholy needs to be supported by more than flat gags about whopper breasts.

12/26/2021,"In the good old days, the fields were green, we’d never heard of Covid and pay packets grew. The last point sounds like a fairytale because stagnant wages have defined the UK’s post-financial crisis economy. Pre-pandemic, we’d only just got earnings back to where they were 12 years before. This living standards austerity means that the 15 years from 2007 to 2022 are forecast to be the worst on record for household incomes: up just 9%, compared with a pre-financial crisis average of almost 50% per 15 years. Some think the lesson from this catastrophe is that we shouldn’t care about economic growth because it has stopped feeding through to workers’ wages. When I’m in a good mood, I think that take is confused. Most of the time, I think it’s dangerous and idiotic.  The real reason our pay has stagnated isn’t that growth hasn’t fed into wages, it’s the lack of growth in the first place. This is really clear in the UK as our productivity and business investment have flatlined. New research reminds us that the link from productivity growth to pay rises is still there across the Atlantic: in the US, a one percentage point increase in productivity growth leads to around 0.7 percentage points faster wage growth (0.5 per cent in Canada). The authors rightly note that higher inequality can weaken this link, creating gaps between typical pay and productivity. It’s not complicated: our new year resolutions should be to get productivity growth up and inequality down.  Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

12/26/2021,"Santa hats and Christmas jumpers added festive colour to the usual PPE for the “jingle jabs” NHS campaign in east London on Christmas Day. In one of at least eight vaccination centres open in England, volunteers decorated Redbridge town hall with Christmas-themed pictures and festive messages as they dealt with a fast-moving queue for booster jabs.  “We’ve tried to jazz it up a little bit, tried to decorate some of the bays. There’s only a limited amount we can do from a clinical point of view, but we’ve tried. Those with their Christmas hats have got them on while trying to observe full PPE,” said Imran Khan, a senior clinical pharmacist at the centre. Khan said the campaign to get people vaccinated at centres open from Christmas Eve to Boxing Day was useful in a diverse area like Ilford and especially for workers who did not have the luxury of working from home. Sadique Shikder, 46, said his job as a bartender meant he was usually too busy to get to a vaccination centre, as did 54-year-old Azmat Hussain, who said he would normally be travelling as a salesman in the financial sector. “We usually do a dinner today and it’s my mum’s birthday as well but because of Covid we’ve had to scale back so I’ll go back and watch TV,” said Hussain. Health secretary Sajid Javid encouraged people to “make the booster a part of your Christmas this year” in response to Omicron, and the NHS tweeted its gratitude to everyone working through the festive period. Primary school teacher Anam Choudhury, 28, said she booked in to get vaccinated on Christmas Day because she expected it to be quiet. “I’m a teacher so wanted to time it for the Christmas holiday and thought I’d get it done today. I’m surprised it’s so busy – I thought I’d be the only one here,” she said. “I think it’s good they’ve got it open as much as possible so people can make the most of it before they go back to work.” “Normally I go and see family but we’ve obviously been a bit wary and reduced it, so it’s just my children and my husband at home. My husband does the cooking so he’s at home preparing.” Volunteer Hashminder Singh Kohli, who is Sikh, said he was happy to be working on Christmas Day and considered it part of his religion to be helping out. Kohli, 54, said he was semi-retired after he closed a business importing Italian clothes because of Brexit. “I didn’t want to sit down and become a couch potato so I volunteered, and it’s also part of my faith to help whoever needs it, whoever they are,” said Kohli, who was encouraged at the centre by Khan, his longtime friend. His plan was to go and see friends for dinner after finishing at the vaccine centre, while Khan said their usual family dinner, though scaled down, was already being prepared. “I prepped my roast potatoes yesterday as I’m the roast-potato man in our house and they’ll be going in the oven later on, and my wife’s getting the roast chicken ready – the halal chicken,” he said.",News/Society,Santa hats at the ready as ‘jingle jabs’ go on at Christmas vaccination centres,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/dec/26/santa-hats-at-the-ready-as-jingle-jabs-go-on-at-christmas-vaccination-centres
