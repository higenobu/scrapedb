4/21/2022,"Self-driving cars could lead to drivers being allowed to watch films on the motorway, under changes to the Highway Code proposed by the Department for Transport The planned updates are intended to smooth the way for adoption of autonomous vehicles on British roads. But they have sparked concern from some, who fear that new regulations may be introduced before the technology is there to support them. The actual definition of a “self-driving” car is hotly contested. At one end of the spectrum, simple driver-assist technologies such as cruise control are decades old, and have been largely incorporated into existing rules without difficulty. At the other end of the spectrum, the dream of a fully autonomous vehicle, that can handle any driving a human can, remains the stuff of science fiction. In between the poles is where disputes lie. Tesla’s “autopilot” technology, for instance, can follow the lanes of a motorway, and handle junctions without intervention, but even drivers who pay the fee to upgrade to what the company calls “full self-driving” must remain at the wheel and alert at all times, in case the car’s software is unable to cope with something unexpected. The industry uses a six-point scale, from 0 to 5, to cover the differences, and considers anything above 3 “automated” to some degree. A level 3 car, like a Tesla, can perform “most” driving tasks, but requires human override occasionally. A level 4 car, like the robot taxis being tested in San Francisco and Phoenix, can perform all driving under specific circumstances – like in a defined city area, for instance – but still preserves the option for human override. Only a level 5 car, which never needs a human to take over and could be made without a steering wheel entirely, is considered “full automation”. The proposal would allow drivers to watch content “not related to driving on built-in display screens, while the self-driving vehicle is in control”. Mobile phones remain specifically banned, however, “given the greater risk they pose in distracting drivers as shown in research”. For a level 5 self-driving car, such a distinction would be moot, since drivers should not be expected to take control ever. For less advanced automation, though, the distinction matters: a built-in screen can be closely linked with the car’s systems, making it easier to alert the driver that they need to pay attention to the road. If the tech lives up to its promise, it should be. A good implementation of a level 3 or level 4 self-driving car – one that expects drivers to take over occasionally – will also take into account the fact that drivers are naturally poor at monitoring the operation of a machine they do not need to control. This is known as the “paradox of automation”: the more efficient an automated system, the more crucial the human contribution when they’re required. If you have a normal car, the vast majority of your driving is likely to be rote and routine. But if you have a self-driving car that can handle 99% of tasks, then you’re going to be put back in charge only in the most difficult 1% of situations. Many of the setbacks of self-driving cars over the past decade have involved dealing with that problem: how do you ensure that a driver is ready to take over at a moment’s notice, when the promise of the technology involves setting them free to do other things? But the latest generation of self-driving cars prioritise “safe disengagement”, pulling over to the side of the road and coming to a stop when there’s difficulty, rather than handing control back to the driver at 70mph. If those safety features are required, then it really can be safe to watch a film while driving. That’s one fight that is still being waged. The British proposals warn that “motorists must be ready to resume control in a timely way if they are prompted to”, the definition of level 4 automation. In most crashes involving self-driving cars, the motorist has technically been at fault – because they haven’t been able to take control in the split second before tragedy occurred. Drivers have been charged in crashes involving Tesla cars, and an experimental Uber self-driving car. But experts have referred to the human drivers in these situations as “moral crumple zones”, parts of the system designed to soak up legal and moral responsibility without having the power to actually improve safety. “While the crumple zone in a car is meant to protect the human driver, the moral crumple zone protects the integrity of the technological system, at the expense of the nearest human operator,” says Madeleine Clare Elish, who coined the term in 2019. Level 3 automation is on British streets already, and level 4 is close behind. Companies in Oxford and Milton Keynes have been testing cars on the road for a couple of years, with increasingly positive results. A simpler version of a “driverless car” can see a company pairing a level 4 AI with wireless broadband, enabling remote safety drivers who don’t need to sit in the car behind a steering wheel. But the industry has long struggled with the hardest part of driving a car: other people. Heavily pedestrianised areas, busy unsigned intersections and pulling out into dense traffic all pose significant problems that may prevent level 5 automation from ever becoming a reality.",News/Technology,Driven to distraction: how close are we to watching films in self-driving cars?,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/20/driven-to-distraction-how-close-are-we-to-watching-films-in-self-driving-cars
4/21/2022,"A safety feature that uses AI technology to scan messages sent to and from children will soon hit British iPhones, Apple has announced. The feature, referred to as “communication safety in Messages”, allows parents to turn on warnings for their children’s iPhones. When enabled, all photos sent or received by the child using the Messages app will be scanned for nudity. If nudity is found in photos received by a child with the setting turned on, the photo will be blurred, and the child will be warned that it may contain sensitive content and nudged towards resources from child safety groups. If nudity is found in photos sent by a child, similar protections kick in, and the child is encouraged not to send the images, and given an option to “Message a Grown-Up”. All the scanning is carried out “on-device”, meaning that the images are analysed by the iPhone itself, and Apple never sees either the photos being analysed or the results of the analysis, it said. “Messages analyses image attachments and determines if a photo contains nudity, while maintaining the end-to-end encryption of the messages,” the company said in a statement. “The feature is designed so that no indication of the detection of nudity ever leaves the device. Apple does not get access to the messages, and no notifications are sent to the parent or anyone else.” Apple has also dropped several controversial options from the update before release. In its initial announcement of its plans, the company suggested that parents would be automatically alerted if young children, under 13, sent or received such images; in the final release, those alerts are nowhere to be found. The company is also introducing a set of features intended to intervene when content related to child exploitation is searched for in Spotlight, Siri or Safari. As originally announced in summer 2021, the communication safety in Messages and the search warnings were part of a trio of features intended to arrive that autumn alongside iOS 15. The third of those features, which would scan photos before they were uploaded to iCloud and report any that matched known child sexual exploitation imagery, proved extremely contentious, and Apple delayed the launch of all three while it negotiated with privacy and child safety groups.",News/Technology,Apple to roll out child safety feature that scans messages for nudity to UK iPhones,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/20/apple-says-new-child-safety-feature-to-be-rolled-out-for-uk-iphones
4/21/2022,"My friend died in January 2021, a few days after testing positive for Covid. He spent the last 12 months of his life in his nursing home more or less in solitary confinement, mostly using Skype to contact family and friends. He was ill and confused, and I’ll never really know if he understood why people had stopped visiting him. I hope he did not think he’d been abandoned. He died in his room in the early hours. I was informed by telephone. After nearly 40 years of friendship, we were unable to say goodbye. We don’t know how Covid got into his nursing home and infected him – only that it was not introduced by a visitor, because there were none. We complied with Boris Johnson’s rules to keep my friend and others safe, in the hope that we could meet again normally. The contrast between us and Boris Johnson could not be greater (Starmer calls Johnson ‘a man without shame’ as PM gives Partygate apology, 19 April). We were not national leaders, just two people trying to do our best in very difficult times. There can be no greater privilege than leading one’s nation, and with great privilege comes a great responsibility to set and maintain the highest standards. Johnson has set the lowest standard one could achieve and compounded his contempt for his privileged position by initially choosing to deny what he did, and then offering an apology in the expectation that we would all move on. My message to him is: it’s time that you moved on.Ann HoldenBarrow-in-Furness, Cumbria  I lack the wisdom and eloquence of Peter Hennessy, referred to in Marina Hyde’s column (Seriously, Tory party, there is no pooper scooper big enough to clear up Johnson’s constant mess, 19 April), but share his despair at the parlous state of our politics, our constitution and our country under Boris Johnson’s leadership. Most Tory MPs seem to have decided to base their decision on whether to oust Johnson on the outcome of the May local elections, ie political expediency, rather than any principle of what is right or wrong. At the same time, this shameless government tries to protect the prime minister by hiding behind Ukraine’s agony. It is difficult to decide which is the more contemptible. It is time to put an end to our national nightmare and be rid of the moral vacuum who currently holds the highest office in the land.Jane BarrettBuxton, Derbyshire  Excellent idea to equate Johnson’s fixed-penalty notice with a speeding fine (‘He was ambushed with cake’ and other stories: Tories get creative to defend PM, 19 April). Three more penalty notices and he will have 12 points on his licence and will be banned from parliament. He may also need to stand in a byelection to get his licence back.

4/21/2022,"Surely the minister for government efficiency should be ensuring that the civil service taps as much national talent as possible and fulfils the spirit and letter of equal opportunities legislation, not returning us to the factory hours of the 19th century (Jacob Rees-Mogg says civil servants must return to the office, 19 April). Traditional set-ups tend to favour men, particularly at the top. The rigidity of the traditional working day makes it harder for parents (most often women) to re-enter the workforce until their children are old enough for paid childcare. For some the cost is so prohibitive that it delays their return much longer. There are other groups we don’t consider enough, such as carers, who could live a life beyond their responsibilities if they were allowed to work more flexibly. Then there are the clinically vulnerable, left behind and marginalised because now there are not sufficient mitigations against Covid infection. The career prospects of those not visible in the office can suffer, but for those not even in work, promotion is even further away.

4/21/2022,"Your editorial (17 April) does not fully address the reason campaigners from across the political spectrum warn against including gender identity alongside sexual orientation in plans to ban “conversion therapy”. Evidence shows that the majority of gender-distressed children who are not “affirmed” in their cross-sex identification outgrow those feelings. The proposals that you endorse would make it harder for therapists to explore what may lie behind gender distress. Common underlying causes include the stirrings of same-sex attraction, undiagnosed autistic-spectrum disorder, trauma from sexual abuse and, for many teenage girls, living in a sexist, porn-saturated world. You say that including gender identity in the ban would have no effect on reputable therapists seeking to explore such issues. But in countries that have already passed such laws, such therapists now risk being misrepresented as trying to “convert” a child fixated on their cross-sex identity. The result is that, in these places, gender-distressed children are more likely to be fast-tracked to puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, surgery – and a lifetime of medical problems, including sexual dysfunction and sterility.

4/21/2022,"In the world of techie businesses fuelled by hope and sky-high multiples of revenues, it’s not only Netflix that has stalled. Look at Just Eat Takeaway, which used to present itself as a deal-a-minute company taking a short-cut to global leadership and profits. Takeaway.com, out of the Netherlands, bought Just Eat of the UK in early 2020 via a reverse takeover (briefly assuming a place in the FTSE 100 index before decamping back to Amsterdam). Only a few months later it announced plans to merge with US operator Grubhub via a $7.3bn all-paper deal at a fat premium. To sceptics who said two mega-transactions in rapid succession would be too much to swallow comfortably, chief executive, Jitse Groen, argued, in effect, that you have to seize the moment in the fast-moving delivery game. Now, with the share price down 70% from its highs, the American adventure looks an expensive mistake. A “strategic partner” will be sought; alternatively, Just Eat will sell part or all of Grubhub. In other words, a strategic U-turn is on the cards in no time at all. Shareholders, including 6% owner Cat Rock, which was gung-ho for Grubhub at the time, seem to have decided that concentrating on Europe is a safer bet. They’re probably correct, though ought to have reined in Groen’s over-ambition in the first place. The result is a fine old mess. It would be a miracle if Grubhub fetches anything like the price that Just Eat paid for it since the two obvious US acquirers, Uber Eats and DoorDash, would surely be offside on competition grounds. Meanwhile, valuations have plummeted across a sector where virtually nobody is making a real bottom-line profit, as opposed to a massaged “adjusted” number. Deliveroo has avoided Just Eat-style calamities on the acquisition front but its share price has still crashed from 390p to 111p in its year as a public company. Whistling cheerfully, Groen pointed to Just Eat’s flat order numbers in the first quarter as evidence that the lockdown whoosh of demand hasn’t evaporated. Fair enough, but the long-term economics of the crowded delivery industry remain a mystery. Growth is happening, but much of it is profit-less growth. Netflix’s woes look mild by comparison. The early winner in the great Twitter/Elon Musk standoff is the UK Takeover Code. Over here, manoeuvres such as the Twitter board’s poison pill defence wouldn’t be allowed. We take the view that shareholders are grownups who are quite capable of rejecting an inadequate bid. That seems a commonsense principle to adopt. Twitter’s poison pill, or “shareholder rights plan”, seeks to deter bidders by threatening to issue stock to other shareholders at a discounted price if anyone (in other words, Musk) acquires more than 15% of the company without board approval. In the UK, that tactic would fall foul of rule 21 in the code – the one that restricts “frustrating actions”. The UK’s underlying logic is sound: if a board wants to resist a takeover offer, it should make its arguments and let shareholders decide. If not, you have a formula for directors putting their own interests ahead of owners’ and enjoying a life of entitlement. Naturally, one can see why Twitter’s board is worried, not just about Musk’s $43bn offer (which looks a long way from being funded and formal) but also about the risk that the maverick billionaire tries to gain creeping control by buying more shares, as he vaguely hinted at doing. But the UK safeguard for that situation also seems sensible: if a party goes above 30% control, it must make an offer to all shareholders at a price at least as good as the ones it recently paid. The different approaches flow from different philosophies. Put bluntly, the US gives more power to boards (possibly one reason why US executive pay is so much more lavish) whereas the UK prioritises fair treatment of shareholders. The UK system may leave the door too open to opportunist predators, especially if the shareholders are poodle-like fund managers whose definition of the long-term is the next quarter, but at least one gets an open scrap. Musk, as it happens, may be the last person one would wish to see entrusted with ownership of Twitter’s cesspit. But he has a point about poison pill tactics: they’re basically underhand and unfair.",News/Business,Just Eat Takeaway’s US adventure now looks like terrible mistake,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/apr/20/just-eat-takeaways-us-adventure-now-looks-like-terrible-mistake

4/21/2022,"The former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has confirmed he will kickstart his campaign to reclaim the presidency from his right-wing adversary Jair Bolsonaro next month, comparing their rivalry to a clash of the titans between Liverpool and Manchester City. Lula’s desire to secure a third term as the leader of Latin America’s largest democracy has been an open secret since he recovered his political rights last year when a series of corruption convictions against him were quashed. But on Tuesday night the veteran leftist finally confirmed he would activate his political comeback on 7 May. He likened the coming battle with Bolsonaro to last weekend’s FA Cup match between Liverpool and Manchester City – in which the red team defeated the blue team 3-2. After launching his candidacy Lula said he would begin touring the South American country, which appears to be emerging from one of the world’s most severe Covid outbreaks. “Brazil needs fixing,” Lula, a two-term president from 2003 to 2011, tweeted after his announcement. With just under six months until the 2 October election, polls put Lula ahead of Bolsonaro, a Trump-style populist who critics blame for soaring Amazon deforestation, undermining democracy, and a disastrous response to a coronavirus epidemic that has killed more than 660,000 people. “Lula’s the favourite, there’s no doubt about it … because in any poll you look at 60% of voters say they reject Bolsonaro,” said Thomas Traumann, a Rio-based political observer. “This is a government that, objectively, is a failure. It didn’t bring economic growth, it didn’t improve people’s lives, it had 660,000 deaths during the pandemic,” Traumann added. Yet despite those failures, Bolsonaro has risen in the polls in recent weeks – partly thanks to billions of pounds of welfare payments being doled out to the poor – suggesting the race may be far closer than many progressives had hoped. “It won’t be easy. This isn’t a war that’s won. It’s a war that we can win,” Lula, 76, who has towered over Brazilian politics since first running for president in 1989, warned during a recent visit to Rio. Hoping to attract centrist voters, Lula has chosen his one-time presidential rival Geraldo Alckmin, a centre-right former governor of São Paulo, as his vice-presidential running mate. “We’re going to join forces to rebuild our country,” Alckmin said after their once improbable partnership was unveiled. Traumann called the alliance an important gesture but believed Lula needed to do more to attract voters from outside the left. That would mean engaging with politicians who helped remove the Workers’ party (PT) from power with the highly controversial 2016 impeachment of Lula’s successor Dilma Rousseff. “The PT won’t beat Bolsonaro on its own,” Traumann said.",News/World news,‘Brazil needs fixing’: Lula confirms comeback run against Bolsonaro,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/20/brazil-needs-fixing-lula-confirms-comeback-run-against-bolsonaro
4/21/2022,"Saqib Mahmood returns for Lancashire on Thursday and begins what could be his final season at the club amid an impasse in contract talks that has put Warwickshire and others on high alert. The 25-year-old fast bowler has risen through the ranks at Old Trafford from its academy setup and made his Test debut during England’s recent Caribbean tour but finds himself out of contract at the end of this campaign. County rules mean players in their final year are free to speak to rival clubs from 1 June and, with previous negotiations between Lancashire and Mahmood over the winter understood to have reached a stalemate, there is a growing expectation he could move on. A number of counties are monitoring the situation and the reigning champions, Warwickshire, are among them. While Mahmood grew up in the north-west, he was born in Birmingham and still has family in the city, with the club hoping this – plus the appeal of remaining at a Test ground – aids their chances. Mahmood is said to remain on good terms with Lancashire despite the difference in opinion over a new deal but has already made one move away from Old Trafford in his career. He swapped Manchester Originals for Oval Invincibles last year when his intitial “icon” deal was downgraded by the franchise after the Hundred’s Covid-related postponement in 2020. This will be a pivotal summer for Mahmood after turning down the Indian Premier League and stating his Test ambitions, with the prospect of a first full England central contract in September if he can build on the performances that made him one of the chief positives to emerge from last month’s 1-0 defeat to West Indies. Rested by England since that tour, where he claimed six wickets in his first two Test outings and struck a gutsy 49 from No 11 in the series decider, Mahmood is part of a 12-man Lancashire squad that host Gloucestershire in the third round of County Championship fixtures starting on Thursday. Jimmy Anderson, 39, also makes his first appearance of the summer for the Red Rose but Stuart Broad (Nottinghamshire), Ollie Robinson (Sussex) and Chris Woakes (Warwickshire) continue to delay the start to their domestic seasons in the lead-up to the first Test against New Zealand that begins on 2 June.

4/21/2022,"One way or another, Boris Johnson will survive the Commons vote tomorrow on whether he misled parliament over the lockdown parties in Downing Street. That bit’s a certainty. But it’s also, very importantly, not the real point of the exercise. The point of Labour’s motion is to get Conservative MPs to dip their hands in the blood. Most Tory MPs, we can be confident, think that Johnson did in fact lie to parliament. Labour’s motion is drafted in as unprovocative a way as possible, in the hope of capitalising on this truth. Johnson is not accused in the motion of deliberately misleading MPs; instead it lists a number of statements to MPs that “appear to amount to misleading the house”. Nor would the inquiry by the privileges committee start until the police investigation is over. In short, Labour has gone out of its way to encourage as many Tory MPs as possible to show their doubts. But the softly, softly approach has a longer purpose too. It means that all those who vote against the motion will also have no excuse in future. They will go on the record as signed-up co-owners of Johnson’s actions and lies. Their votes for Johnson are certain to form the basis of thousands of targeted general election messages. Because lockdown parties have outraged most of the general public, Thursday’s vote will therefore weaken both Johnson and the Tories. Political eclipse is almost never an overnight business. The drip-drip of vanishing authority takes time. David Cameron is probably the only 21st-century prime minister to fall quickly. The others have seen their authority dwindle away bit by bit. The same thing is now happening to Johnson in front of our eyes. It’s even visible in the way he looks and sounds. You don’t come back from things like this. He will try, for the umpteenth time, to declare the matter over, but this is another lose-lose moment for Johnson. Lose the vote, and he is not packing his bags. He is instead at the mercy of the Commons privileges committee, which would conduct an inquiry, obtain previously unpublished documents and photographs from the lockdown parties, and potentially censure or even suspend Johnson from the Commons. That would require another vote, with another set of dilemmas for Tory MPs. Yet win the vote, and Johnson still loses in the long run. Not only have his backbenchers been made complicit in his unpopular action, but he and they are still in the middle of a minefield. The threats are familiar: further fines, further apologies, Sue Gray’s report, local election defeats, a widening Labour poll lead. Just one of these could change the mood entirely, whatever the result of the vote. It would be a big mistake to underestimate the significance of all this. When confronted with a prime minister convicted of an offence, or a disgraced MP such as Imran Ahmad Khan or Claudia Webbe, it is easy to be angry with parliament’s formalities about honourable members and the rest of it. Most MPs nevertheless do actually want to be honourable, do want to obey the rules and do want to do the right thing. Johnson acolytes such as Jacob Rees-Mogg like to give the impression that for a Tory MP to vote against Labour’s motion will be a mere bagatelle in an endless party game that Tories always win. But choosing which way to jump matters more than you may think to those who are actually faced with the choice. Propriety is important to a lot of these MPs. They still possess a moral compass. And they certainly have an instinct for self-preservation. In my experience, nothing – but nothing – matters more to MPs than being re-elected. The reality is that the Tory party now has a vacancy for a new leader it thinks would win an election Johnson would lose. The problem is that it hasn’t got a candidate. That says a lot about the state of the party, and much of this is Johnson’s own doing. By getting rid of people including Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Rory Stewart in 2019, he jettisoned some plausible rivals. But it’s also because Rishi Sunak has self-destructed and Liz Truss’s rise has slowed. As for the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, who is often deemed to be having a good war, and who currently tops the supposedly influential ConservativeHome ministerial charts, one MP tells me that not even Wallace himself thinks he should run. At which point it is worth asking the following question: if you were Jeremy Hunt, what would you be doing now? The former health and foreign secretary was Johnson’s closest rival in 2019. A third of the party members who voted in the leadership election backed him. He has not created trouble for Johnson since. But Hunt definitely still wants the top job. He has clearly been taking soundings in the party, and appears to have an embryonic team in place. Yet Hunt does nothing. Instead he bides his time. Perhaps he will close in after the local elections. But he has work to do with the party – and the electorate – to boost his credentials. He needs to declare where he stands, perhaps by making a serious and ideas-heavy speech before or very soon after 5 May. Offering some form of Johnsonism without Johnson won’t cut it. If people want Johnsonism there is only one person on offer. If Hunt is not careful, he may find that he is positioning himself to be a Conservative leader of the opposition, not a Conservative prime minister. That depends on Johnson, but it also depends on Labour. Labour’s current priority is not necessarily to oust Johnson. It is to keep weakening him over Partygate and the cost of living, and hope the May elections deliver further evidence that Labour is now seen as an alternative government. That is why victory in the Wakefield byelection is essential for Labour, which is in turn why so much attention is being given to choosing a byelection-proof candidate. If I were Keir Starmer, I would want the retiring TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, to run. In most of England and Wales, though not in Scotland and Northern Ireland, Partygate and the cost of living seem to be changing the terms of the party political battle in ways that were not widely predicted after Johnson’s 2019 triumph. When the next general election comes, it is quite likely that in the majority of parliamentary seats the battle for votes will now take a more familiar, pre-Brexit form of a battle for undecided voters. Before that happens, however, there remain big battles within the two major parties as well as between them, as the vote on Thursday will surely show.

Her numerous horse books included Classic Lives (1973), on the breeding of racehorses; Summer with Tommy (1974), about breaking in a pony; and a guide to the horses of the world, in which she claimed to have included two invented breeds of horse to make it seem the most comprehensive on the subject. She also exercised racehorses, wrote scripts for short BBC films, and even featured as a stunt artist in a television series. In the early 80s, she wrote a lively and witty monthly property column for Harpers & Queen magazine. Born in Edgbaston, Birmingham, Caroline was the only child of Philip Green, a chartered accountant, and Ethne Francis, an auricula enthusiast. After leaving Kingsley school, Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Caroline had a quirky finishing school mix of the National Training College of Domestic Subjects in London, the Pudupet Convent School of Commerce in Madras (now Chennai), and Lucie Clayton. She had a passion for knowledge, undertaking courses at Columbia University in New York in the 60s, and later in horticulture and horse care at Hartpury College, Gloucestershire, and in nursing from the Red Cross. She did not have a degree, but would cheerfully invent one if required: she believed that if you could do a job well, you should have the job. Caroline loved horses, cats and wildlife. She would leave saucers of food on her bedside chest for her pet cats, and woke once to find herself nose to nose with a badger that had been attracted in through the catflap by the food. She spent hours on horseback from childhood, won the first point-to-point she rode in, and wrote a vivid account for the Telegraph magazine whose February 1969 cover featured her in action. She later wrote about racing for the Telegraph and was the Sunday Times equestrian correspondent. Caroline married the architect Nathan Silver in 1961. They divorced in 1970; her 1978 marriage to the naive artist Vincent Haddelsey also ended in divorce. Devoted to her parents, Caroline looked after them while running a B&B in Amberley, Gloucestershire, and she met Richard “Biffo” Barnes, who in 1997 became her third husband, when he came to nurse her father. Biffo died in 2020. Generous with her time, Caroline had a great gift for friendship. Planning the funeral route for the horse-drawn coffin, her friends agreed that it would be the first time Caroline had gone twice past the Amberley Inn without going in.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Caroline Silver obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/apr/20/caroline-silver-obituary
4/21/2022,"You will need black shoes, black trousers or skirt, a white shirt, waistcoat and a black cape. Fangs on the upper teeth are compulsory, pallid skin helpful and a murderous demeanour optional. English Heritage has announced plans to break a world record few knew needed breaking: it wants to stage the world’s largest gathering of people dressed as a vampire. The setting will be Whitby Abbey, the dramatically atmospheric 13th century gothic abbey that helped inspire Bram Stoker to write the classic novel which this year is 125 years old. Mark Williamson, site manager for the Abbey, said every generation had their own Dracula or vampire, whether it was Christopher Lee in the 1950s and 60s Hammer horror films, Wesley Snipes as Blade or Robert Pattinson as the sensitive blood-sucker in Twilight. “Everyone has their own vampire and people come every year to Whitby and the abbey in their thousands,” he said. “It feels like a spiritual home to Dracula.” It was in Whitby that Stoker soaked up the atmosphere that would be a key part of the novel’s success including the dramatic abbey ruins, the innocent tourists, the beautiful harbour and salty tales from gnarled local folk. A trip to the town’s public library led to Stoker coming across a book published in 1820 by William Wilkinson, An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia: With Various Political Observations Relating to Them. In there was a story of a 15th-century prince called Vlad Tepes, said to impale his enemies on wooden stakes. He was known as Dracula. Whitby is attempting to surpass a record set at an amusement park in Doswell, Virginia, on 30 September 2011, when 1,039 vampire impersonators gathered as part of a Halloween event. It has been a surprisingly tricky record to surpass. A 2019 attempt outside a church in Dublin failed, as did one in 2013 in West Sussex. Organisers of the West Sussex bid blamed too many vampires wearing non-regulation shoes. “The criteria is really, really tight, so we fell short,” one said. English Heritage obviously need to get 1,040 certified vampires to the record attempt on 26 May but Williamson said he hoped to get 1,897, marking the year Dracula was first published. “That’s the dream of dreams and I think we can do it.” There are criteria for what counts as looking like a vampire and adjudicators will be there to judge whether each person makes the cut. For some, the cape will be the stumbling block. Who on earth has a cape? “I’ve got two,” said Williamson. “I happen to live with a costume historian so I’ve got one from the 1840s. I’ve got to, haven’t I? I’ve got to do it right.”",Arts/Books,Whitby Abbey seeks budding bloodsuckers to break vampire record,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/apr/20/whitby-abbey-seeks-budding-bloodsuckers-to-break-vampire-record-bram-stoker
4/21/2022,"My friend and colleague Alan Buchanan, who has died from oesophageal cancer aged 90, worked for many years as a civil engineer but in retirement decided to start a second career. Alan studied paper conservation at Camberwell College of Art, south London, graduating in 1991 and opening his own studio in 1993. His engineering training proved to be invaluable and before long he was designing and manufacturing equipment that became a mainstay of professional conservation practice. His designs included a cedar-wood humidity box, a book cradle to hold delicate books safely during digitisation (developed in collaboration with the Bodleian Library, Oxford), a small-area, high-pressure suction point ideal for removal of small stains, and, perhaps the most notable of his developments, the vacuum or suction table with a built-in light box. With his desire to enhance conservation treatments, one of his projects addressed the need for paper-making pulp to match the specific colour of a work of art under treatment in the studio. To this end, he created colour charts of the different shades, provided stock and published a paper on the subject for the BAPH Quarterly, the journal of the British Association of Paper Historians (No 65, January 2008). Alan contributed to the conservation profession at a crucial stage, becoming treasurer of the Institute of Paper Conservation in 1995 and then chair of the institute in 1997, helping to oversee the introduction of a formal accreditation process for paper conservators. Alan had enormous energy and from 2005 willingly combined his conservation work with teaching a new generation of postgraduate students at Camberwell, something he found rewarding. The youngest of nine children of Jean and Robert Buchanan, Alan was educated at Gordonstoun school and Downing College, Cambridge, where he studied mechanical engineering. After his degree he did his national service in the Royal Marines. This was during the cold war and he was part of the “stay-behind” forces, clandestine units tasked with burying equipment in secret caches in Austria for use in the event of a Warsaw Pact invasion. Afterwards, he worked as a civil engineer both in Britain and overseas, including Africa and the far east. After retiring aged 58, Alan was looking for something to do and his close friend Tony Messenger, who was head of graphics at Camberwell College of Art, suggested the paper conservation course, which welcomed mature students. Alan is survived by his second wife, Elissa (nee Lambke), whom he married in 1970, by his children, Ben, Polly, Nelson and Alice, from his marriage to Gretchen (nee Dillaway), which ended in divorce, by three grandsons and his half-brothers, Iain and Peter.",News/Environment,Alan Buchanan obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/20/alan-buchanan-obituary
