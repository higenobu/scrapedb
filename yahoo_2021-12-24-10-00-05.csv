12/24/2021,"A registered sex offender is facing a new set of charges after police caught him raping an Asian woman at a Manhattan construction site on Wednesday.

The scene: New York police had to physically pull Darryl Phelps, 61, off the woman at around 1:30 a.m. under scaffolding at a construction site on West 28th Street near Eighth Avenue in Chelsea. A witness who saw the attack called 911.
 The victim said she was walking home when Phelps punched her face, the New York Daily News reported. The suspect, who stands at6 feet and weighs 200 pounds, then raped her while he was “holding her down on the ground.” “I want you to have my baby,” Phelps allegedly told the victim, according to the New York Post. He was still raping her when officers arrived on the scene. The victim, a 23-year-old restaurant worker, was taken to Lenox Health Greenwich Village. She sustained a bruised eye but was brought to the medical care facility in stable condition, However, a police source told the New York Post that “she’s not mentally OK after that.” 


The charges: Phelps was charged with rape, criminal sex act, sex abuse and assault, according to WABC. Records show he was released on Sept. 9 on lifetime parole after spending 23 years in jail for burglary and attempted rape.
 During the 997 incident, Phelps trailed a 33-year-old woman and attempted to rape her in her apartment.. He then locked her in her bathroom, stole her personal belongings and fled the scene. Phelps reportedly assaulted and robbed the woman on July 11, 1997, the same day he was released on parole for another robbery conviction back in 1987. The state Parole Board, which denied his release in 2019 and 2020, described him as a public risk and mentioned “prior failures on community supervision” and “three incidents of misbehavior” while he was in prison. Phelps has seven aliases. He is registered as a Level 2 sex offender with a designation of sexually violent offender.

12/24/2021,"WASHINGTON (AP) — North Carolina Rep. Madison Cawthorn and his wife, Cristina Bayardelle, are divorcing after about a year of marriage, citing the difficulty of “balancing the enormity” of transitioning to a congressman's life, according to a statement tweeted Wednesday by Cawthorn’s spokesperson. The 26-year-old ally of former President Donald Trump became the youngest member of Congress last year after his election to the vacant 11th District seat previously held by Mark Meadows. Cawthorn announced last month he will run in a new congressional district, a seat that is friendlier to Republicans. The couple married in April on the anniversary of a 2014 crash that left him partially paralyzed, months after they were legally wed in December 2020, news outlets reported. While they agreed he should run, their lives changed overnight after his election, Cawthorn said in his statement. “From the outset, we committed to make things work, to fight for our marriage, and seek counsel for balancing the enormity of such a transition in life,” he said. “Together, we realized that balance was not attainable, and that we had irreconcilable differences between us.” Bayardelle said in a statement that she did not plan on the effect his political career would have on their relationship, WJZY-TV reported. “I want to live in the world he creates, I just don’t want to be married to someone changing the world,” she said. “While we have agreed to be apart now, we still have a great friendship and there’s no ill-will. Madison is a fighter — he will help save this country.”",Politics/Associated Press,"US Rep.

In Wednesday's ""West Wing Playbook"" newsletter, an unspecified number of unnamed White House staffers expressed low morale and a lack of appreciation working for the Biden administration. The atmosphere was exemplified as the White House set aside three days for staffers to bring their friends and family to tour the building and see the holiday decor, using a lottery system to dole out slots for staffers to come in, the newsletter said. White House Operations later asked employees to volunteer to staff five extra days for tours for non-White House staff. Some disgruntled staffers groused over ""DC Randos"" posting to social media that they'd visited the White House, Politico reported. ""No one expects business as usual during the pandemic, but it's beyond demoralizing, it's insulting — especially when you see DNC and Hill staff and other DC types get invited,"" one White House official told Politico.

12/24/2021,"NEW YORK — A retired NYPD officer says she quit the force — and a coveted assignment at Yankee Stadium — because her boss repeatedly raped her at the ballpark, the ex-cop claims in a Bronx Supreme Court lawsuit. The former cop alleges that New York Police Department Capt. Jeffrey Brienza first sexually assaulted her after work in a bathroom at the Bronx stadium in June 2020 and then continued to force himself on her for more than a year after that, according to the suit filed against Brienza and the city on Monday. “There were times when I used to feel like it’s unending,” the retired officer, who asked to remain anonymous, told the New York Daily News. “I would cry a lot of times. I would just wonder how am I going to get out of this. I saw no end. I felt so stuck ... I just felt so worthless and without any purpose.” The 47-year-old woman said she was working at the 50th Precinct in Riverdale when she was offered a spot on the Yankee Stadium detail in March 2020. When the 20-year-veteran started the stadium detail, Brienza took her under his wing, she said. But Brienza, 48, soon turned the woman into his personal driver and insisted she run errands with him, she told the Daily News. Three months into her time at the stadium, she said she noticed someone lurking behind her while she was washing her hands in a bathroom, according to the suit. “He grabbed me from behind around my waist,” the retiree recalled. “I grabbed him and I was peeling his hands from around my waist and I felt his grip tightening and at that point I realized what he was doing, so I said, ‘No.’ He said, ‘Yes.’"" The woman alleges Brienza forced her to perform oral sex on him, then pushed her up against a sink and raped her, the lawsuit details. Afterward, he left without a word, the mother of three said. “I was afraid. There was a lot of things going through my head. I was kind of blaming myself like maybe I could have yelled louder,” she explained. Days later, the woman claims Brienza called her into his office, asked her if she told anyone about what happened in the bathroom and said she could get in trouble. “Everyone thinks he’s a great guy. Everyone loves him. I was new to the stadium,” the woman said. “I was afraid to say anything because he’s the captain.” The alleged abuse continued, with Brienza forcing her to perform oral sex on him in his office or in her car, sometimes more than once a day, the lawsuit alleges. “I feel like I was being pressured each time,” she said. If she “made herself unavailable for his sexual attacks,” the lawsuit says, Brienza would give her less desirable assignments that he referred to as “piece of s--t posts,” the legal documents reveal. During the seventh inning of one Yankees game, the woman claims that instead of taking her position outside to prepare for the end of the game, Brienza made her stay in his office. Her boss pushed her head toward his groin and said, “You take your post,” according to the lawsuit. “Supervisors in the NYPD have to stop viewing their subordinates as potential sex slaves,” the woman’s lawyer, Fred Lichtmacher said. After one alleged rape in the NYPD women’s locker room at Yankee Stadium in September, the woman decided she could not take the abuse any longer, realizing it was destroying her love of the job as well as her physical and mental health, she said. “I couldn’t even set foot in the building. It was just the strangest thing,” she said. “It’s literally like I couldn’t move. I couldn’t go. My heart was racing and I would be sweaty. ... Everyone was there but no one to talk to.” That month, she reported the alleged assaults to a union delegate, who informed the NYPD, which started an Internal Affairs Bureau probe, she said. The NYPD said the allegations are under investigation and declined to comment on the lawsuit. The city Law Department said it would review the case when they’re served. Brienza was transferred to the 25th Precinct a month after the woman first spoke to the Internal Affairs Bureau. The captain could not be reached for comment, but Chris Monahan, president of the NYPD’s Captain’s Endowment Association said, “These are far-fetched and reaching allegations that will be determined untrue.” The woman retired shortly afterward and has little faith in an investigation into a higher-ranking member of the department. “The Police Department has no room for someone like me who reported your captain,” she said. “One of the things I wanted to miraculously happen is I go back to work, but I don’t think that’s reality. “I would like to know no one else will go through what I went through.” ———",U.S./NY Daily News,"Retired cop says NYPD boss repeatedly raped her at Yankee Stadium, lawsuit says",https://news.yahoo.com/retired-cop-says-nypd-boss-005400858.html
12/24/2021,"By Reuters Staff PARIS (Reuters) - France has cancelled its order for Merck & Co's COVID-19 antiviral drug following disappointing trial data and hopes instead to receive Pfizer's competing drug before the end of January, the health minister said on Wednesday. France is the first country to publicly say it has cancelled an order for the Merck treatment after the company released data in late November suggesting its drug was markedly less effective than previously thought, reducing hospitalisations and deaths in its clinical trial of high-risk individuals by about 30%. ""The latest studies weren't good,"" Olivier Veran told BFM TV. Merck did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. While vaccines are the main weapons against COVID-19 for governments, there are hopes Merck and Pfizer's experimental pills could be a game-changer in reducing the chances of dying or hospitalisation for those most at risk of severe illness. France had placed an early order for 50,000 doses of the nucleoside analogue drug molnupiravir developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. The cancellation would not incur a cost, Veran said. In Italy, the office of the special commissioner for the COVID emergency said on Nov 18 it had received a mandate from the health ministry to buy 50,000 courses of Merck's pill and another 50,000 of Pfizer's. ""The contract has not yet been finalised, but is in progress,"" a spokesperson for the commissioner told Reuters on Tuesday. Italian drug regulator Aifa's head Nicola Magrini told a Senate committee on Dec. 9 the two treatments could be available in Italy from the end of January. However, regardless of the availability of the drugs, there will be assessments of their use, two top government scientific advisers told Reuters. ""There must and will be an evaluation, independently of the assessments of regulatory bodies,"" Walter Ricciardi, top adviser of health minister Roberto Speranza, told Reuters. Germany has already bought Merck's antiviral treatment, health minister Karl Lauterbach told Reuters on Wednesday. ""This is a binding order,"" he said, adding Berlin was also in talks with Pfizer about buying its antiviral drug. The European Medicines Agency is expected to decide whether to approve the Merck and Pfizer pills in the new year. Pfizer's Paxlovid, a protease inhibitor, has shown near 90% efficacy in preventing COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths in high-risk patients. France had purchased that drug instead, Veran said, without saying how many doses it had secured. ""France is lined up to get it before the end of January,"" Veran continued. It has not yet been decided whether the drug would be available over the counter in pharmacies, the minister said.",World/Reuters,France cancels order for Merck's COVID-19 antiviral drug,https://news.yahoo.com/france-cancels-order-mercks-covid-125445398.html
