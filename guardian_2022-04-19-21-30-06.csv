4/19/2022,"In 2014, one of the first and most celebrated sound systems of the UK’s rave era marked 25 years in the same way they had started. In a packed out marquee in the idyllic Derbyshire countryside, under the glint of a disco ball, DiY’s co-founders Harry Harrison, Rick “Digs” Down, Simon “DK” Smith and Pete “Woosh” Birch united under the groove of house music to throw their last free party together. “It went on and on through to Sunday,” says Harrison. “It was fantastic but very messy. The police turned up. It was proper DiY, like the old days.” This quartet of inveterate ravers – and a wider party crew of around 100 active members – spent those old days creating dance music events that bridged two kindred yet separate worlds: the outdoor free parties that were much maligned by police and the press, and the new urban clubbing scene that exploded in their wake. DiY’s story has now been chronicled in a book by Harrison called Dreaming in Yellow, named in honour of an audaciously trippy track made by Smith and Birch, who died in 2020 after a five-year battle with cancer. “I’d known him since I was 15,” Harrison says. “We were the musical-theoretical-political duo at the heart of it all, really.” Harrison, Birch and co founded DiY following the two acid house “summers of love” in 1988 and 1989, convinced that they were going to change the world. “I think we did, a bit,” Harrison declares. “We had discovered a way of moving barriers between north and south, black and white, gay and straight, men and women.” They would use the crew’s own cultural diversity – squatters and students, travellers and townies, fashionistas and football lads – as a statement: if we can work (and party) together, then so can you. “House was a feeling that ran deep in all of us,” says Emma Kirby, a traveller who became DiY’s first female DJ. “Most travellers and city clubbers united with no prejudices. We were all accepting of each other.” “DiY put themselves on the line for dance music,” says Matthew Collin, author of Altered State, an authoritative history of rave. “They were trying to do something idealistic in the hedonistic world of dance culture.” For Collin, sound systems like DiY – itinerant units that threw unlicensed parties in fields, quarries and other outdoor spaces – represented a radical revolt against the state and the increased infringement on personal liberties in the UK that began with police violence against the travelling community at free festivals in the 70s and 80s, and calcified during the rave era at the turn of the 90s. As Harrison points out in his book, DiY’s politics were “based on hedonism as much as protest, dancing as much as discussion”. DiY’s story played out in those ungoverned fields and quarries, and the catalyst was Glastonbury’s last free festival on the Travellers Field in 1990. The crew had been attending since 1985 and by the summer of 1990, DiY’s budding DJs had thrown a few house parties and club nights in Nottingham. They didn’t have a sound system yet, just enthusiasm and DJ gear, which they loaded into a van. They would end up taking over Hawkwind’s pyramid-shaped marquee in the free zone, battling with bands to play some of Glastonbury’s earliest iterations of dance music. “Glastonbury was our pivotal moment,” says Harrison. “We were there in the Pyramid and we were blessed by the KLF. That’s some pretty strong magic!” When Kirby started DJing under her first name for DiY, she returned to her teenage love of hip-hop and electro; Rick “Digs” Down leaned into disco and funk, and he and Pete “Woosh” Birch quickly became a formidable DJ duo with their Served Chilled brand. Simon “DK” Smith was DiY’s proper house head, who would rather buy records than food. Harrison, meanwhile, was “an indie kid at heart” who quit DJing after three disastrous attempts. His book is littered with colourful anecdotes, such as Bez, eyes popping out of his head, staring down a horse in the pyramid marquee at Glastonbury 1990, or DiY DJ Pezz impersonating Sasha when the soon to be superstar DJ gets detained by snow. When DiY hosted a night at the Haçienda, which is where they had been turned on to house music in the first place, the crew were ejected after a member was caught smoking weed, and the DJs were personally booted off the decks by their boyhood heroes, Tony Wilson and Peter Hook. DiY were invited back, only to be kicked out again for trashing the VIP room, causing the club’s head of security to brandish them, Harrison says, “worse than the Happy Mondays”. Harrison is careful to couch DiY’s shenanigans in their social and political context. Another pivotal moment in his book is Castlemorton, the notorious week-long free festival that took place in Worcestershire in May 1992. DiY’s devotion to house music, alongside the likes of John Coltrane, De La Soul and George Clinton, made them stand out from the rest of the “nosebleed techno” sound systems such as Spiral Tribe that had coalesced in this quaint corner of England. The book begins with Harrison and Birch gazing down at the site on the first night, which Harrison describes as “some giant military operation, or perhaps a huge, dark creature with endless rows of bright white eyes”. “Castlemorton was probably the best PR we ever did,” Harrison says now, given the popularity of their tent – and the high-profile fallout from the event. The local MP Michael Spicer claimed the free party crews had “combined to terrorise the local community to the extent that some residents had to undergo psychiatric treatment”, and the furore led to the 1994 Criminal Justice and Public Order Act (CJA) that criminalised unlicensed events playing music characterised by “the emission of a succession of repetitive beats”. In the book Harrison describes the CJA as “madness, both laughable and sinister”. Reflecting on it now, he adds: “There were bits in the CJA that were worse than the rave bit: it abolished the centuries-old right to silence upon arrest, it privatised prisons, it introduced DNA swabs and adult sentencing for juveniles.” The years between Castlemorton and the CJA passing into law galvanised DiY. They teamed up with other Midlands sound systems to form the activist group All Systems No!, raising around £50,000 to fight the CJA. They subsidised buses down to London to attend a series of protest marches in 1994 with “quite a lot of them ending in comic circumstances”, says Harrison, as when DiY members (Harrison included) stripped naked to join the other politicised party-goers dancing in the fountains of Trafalgar Square during the first “Kill the Bill” demo. Harrison ended up in a police cell that day – not for the first time – and he alleges he was assaulted by riot officers. “We were never going to win but we certainly gave it a good go and had a laugh doing it,” he says, “and if DiY had an epitaph, that’s pretty much it.” The dichotomy between social anger and hedonistic indulgence started to collapse as one impulse superseded the other. Harrison’s drug references throughout Dreaming in Yellow are frequent and candid; what’s missing are the darker consequences of DiY’s – and indeed, the rave generation’s – ubiquitous drug use. “We lost people to the darkness,” admits Harrison. “A lot became addicts and are still addicts. A lot of people are clean. I went to rehab myself in 2008.” Harrison now works as a counsellor for people with substance use issues. “Stick to what you know,” he laughs, but then becomes serious. “As the rave generation, we burned ourselves out, and the four of us at the heart of it definitely sacrificed our sanity for the sake of DiY.” Harrison and Birch had a huge falling out in 1997, Harrison moved to San Francisco and DiY “was never quite the same again”. (The pair made up a decade later when Harrison returned to the UK.) “Digs”, now known as Grace Sands, is the only really active DJ from the collective: a key figure in the queer London scene with a residency at the cult NYD party Adonis, who regularly plays Glastonbury for Block 9’s NYC Downlow. Since Birch’s death, the crew have officially disbanded. Is this really the end? “We never really stopped being DiY,” Harrison concludes. “It wasn’t like working for Tesco. It wasn’t a lifestyle choice for us – it has been a lifelong mission to change the world through quality music, comradeship and above all, love. You can never kill a state of mind. The mission continues.”  Dreaming in Yellow: The Story of DiY Sound System is out now, published by Velocity Press",Arts/Music,90s rave crew DiY Sound System: ‘We definitely sacrificed our sanity’,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/19/90s-rave-crew-diy-sound-system-interview-we-sacrificed-our-sanity
4/19/2022,"Joe Biden has told Barack Obama he will run for re-election in 2024, according to a Washington website, the Hill. The site cited two anonymous sources. One was quoted as saying Biden “wants to run and he’s clearly letting everyone know”. It was not clear when Biden told Obama his plans. But Obama visited the White House earlier this month, to celebrate the Affordable Care Act. Introducing his host, Obama called him “vice-president Biden”. “That was a joke,” he said, to laughter. Biden was vice-president to Obama from 2009 to 2017. He won the presidency on his own third attempt in 2020 (after short-lived campaigns in 1988 and 2008), beating Donald Trump. At 78, Biden was the oldest president ever inaugurated. If he won again he would be 82 at the start of his second term. Amid competing crises, from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the coronavirus and rampant inflation at home, Biden’s approval ratings have plummeted. Most observers expect Republicans to retake Congress in November. But the president has dropped plenty of hints that he does plan to run again. In September, it was widely reported that Biden and aides had told allies he planned to run again. In December, Biden said he would run if he stayed in good health. He has also said Kamala Harris, his vice-president, would be on the ticket again. In his December interview with ABC News, Biden said another Trump candidacy would “increase the prospect of running”. In Brussels in March, Biden referred to Trump again when he said: “In the next election, I’d be very fortunate if I had that same man running against me.” Trump, 75, is readying his own third run for the presidency. One of the sources who spoke to the Hill said Biden “thinks he’s the only one who can beat Trump. I don’t think he thinks there’s anyone in the Democratic party who can beat Trump and that’s the biggest factor”. In 2020, Biden surged to victory in the Democratic primary on the back of support from Black voters – and a quickly gathering sense that he was indeed the party’s best hope of beating Trump. According to books and reportage about the 2020 campaign, Obama doubted whether Biden could win. Edward-Isaac Dovere, author of Battle for the Soul: Inside the Democrats’ Campaigns to Defeat Trump, reports: “Obama was doubtful about [Biden’s] prospects. He didn’t think Biden could be a disciplined enough candidate.” Dovere also says Obama doubted Biden’s stamina for the race, was not sure he had the requisite “swagger” for an American president, and worried his vice-president had “trouble … connecting with crowds”. But Dovere also quotes Jen Psaki, now Biden’s White House press secretary, as saying Obama “undervalued Biden’s political abilities because they had such different styles”.",News/US news,Biden told Obama he will run again in 2024 – report,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/joe-biden-run-again-2024-report
4/19/2022,"Civil service unions have condemned a “vindictive” move by efficiency minister Jacob Rees-Mogg to name and shame Whitehall departments with the highest rates of working from home as part of a new drive to encourage staff back to the office. Rees-Mogg has circulated a league table of all 16 Whitehall departments’ office occupancy in an attempt to end civil servants working from home. The Department for Education topped Rees-Mogg’s working from home league table with 25% of staff coming into the office at the start of April. It was followed by the Department for Work and Pensions at 27%, and the Foreign Office at 33%. The figures for the first working week of April were attached to a letter to all permanent secretaries urging them to encourage staff back into the office. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA representing senior civil servants, reacted with fury to the letter and the league table. He said: “It’s ludicrous that civil servants are being counted with clickers. Ministers should be concentrating on what’s being delivered, not numbers at desks.” The general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), Mark Serwotka, said: “These comments from Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Conservative colleagues are a slap in the face to PCS members who worked tirelessly and who made immense sacrifices during the pandemic. “For over two years, often under the government’s own instruction, many of our members have demonstrated that they can do their job from home. The suggestion that they’ve been ‘sitting at home’ is deeply insulting. “The government rightly lauded our members when it mattered. Now they seek to denigrate and offend them. Instead, they should embrace the benefits of hybrid working and make good on their promise to build back better.” The most occupied Whitehall office in Rees-Mogg’s table was the Department for International Trade at 73%, followed by the Department of Health and Social Care on 72%. In his letter, Rees-Mogg argued that ending working from home would bring the benefits of “face-to-face, collaborative working”. It said: “I urge you to issue a clear message to civil servants in your department to ensure a rapid return to the office.” Downing Street also repeated Rees-Mogg’s call for civil servants to return to the office. A spokesman for Boris Johnson said: “Clearly the prime minister feels that it is important that we make best use of taxpayer-funded departments which are not returning, currently, to the levels we saw before the pandemic. “This is not simply just about value-for-money for taxpayer-funded buildings, but also it’s a benefit to the staff – particularly junior staff who benefit from face-to-face working – and obviously we know there are benefits that can help, therefore, delivery for the public as well.” Penman accused Rees-Mogg of behaving like a Luddite while the private sector has embraced the benefits of flexible working. In a statement Penman added: “There is no rationale for this. Ministers can’t point to productivity losses, which is why it’s always anonymous sources making the insulting accusations.” “Ministers’ obsession with ending flexible working and micro-managing the Civil Service increasingly just looks vindictive. “Jacob Rees-Mogg is the minister for government efficiency, yet that isn’t even a consideration in his correspondence with ministers. “The private sector has embraced hybrid working, recognising the efficiencies it delivers and competitive edge it gives to employers in a tight labour market. “Meanwhile, the Luddites in Cabinet insist on micro-managing the Civil Service, which will only deter good people from joining while simultaneously demotivating those already there.” Rees-Mogg was backed by the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis, who said it was “a very good thing” for people to be back in the workplace. “There’s something different about that face-to-face interaction,” he told Times Radio. “I think anybody who’s been missing that recognises that, but there’s also the issue, particularly for new staff and younger staff, about being able to become part of a team and get to know their colleagues. “Actually, that doesn’t work in a virtual world. You need to be in an office to be able to learn from others to work with others and get to know each other, so I think people being back in the workplace is a very good thing.” A government spokesperson said: “Ministers have been clear that departments should make maximum use of office space and progress is being monitored.”",News/Politics,Civil service unions condemn Rees-Mogg’s ‘vindictive’ back-to-office drive,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/19/civil-service-unions-condemn-rees-moggs-vindictive-back-to-office-drive
4/19/2022,"Recurring throughout Lennart Hüper’s sombre documentary are images of the vast, deep ocean, whose rippling surface hums with an ominous melancholy. Against a gloomy soundscape of crashing waves and beeping boat signals, staggering facts flash up on the screen, stating the numbers of Libyan refugees who have died or gone missing at sea as they attempt to escape from their war-torn country and detention camps to Europe. Meanwhile, Lifeline, a civilian ship that carries out rescue missions for refugees, has been impounded on the coast of Malta for months, as its captain Claus-Peter Reisch endures fines and charges of commanding an improperly registered ship. Exposing how the arduous legal ordeal is a red herring in a political unwillingness to aid refugees, the film documents the inspiring resilience with which Reisch and his crew maintain the day-to-day operation of Lifeline while seeking legislative changes to allow government-sanctioned aid for refugees stranded at sea. At one point, Lifeline supporters hand out leaflets during the festive season to holiday shoppers; the matter-of-fact scenes of seasonal jollity feel especially heartbreaking when, right on their doorsteps, the same simple luxury is denied to displaced Libyan refugees. Much of No News revolves around the unsettling monotony of waiting. As the Lifeline crew patiently prepare their meals every day, the waste of resources underlines the cruelty of bureaucracy. The Libyan refugees are also waiting for something that might never come, a longing hemmed in by death, violence and uncertainty.

4/19/2022,"Some of the largest, most profitable companies in retail and food services are still paying most of their workers less than $15 an hour, and many still make less than $10 an hour, according to a new company wage tracker developed by the Economic Policy Institute and the Shift Project. The tracker, which covers 66 large retail and food service corporations, found: Dollar General pays 92% of workers less than $15 an hour and 22% are paid less than $10 an hour. McDonald’s pays 89% of its workers less than $15 an hour and 23% are paid less than $10 an hour. Wendy’s pays 87% of workers less than $15 an hour and 17% are paid less than $10 an hour. At Sonic, 85% of workers are paid less than $15 an hour and 22% less than $10 an hour. Similarly high percentages were found at Arby’s, Burger King, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. The report was released as many of these firms have complained about being unable to find staff. Some fast-food firms, such as In and Out Burger, pay much more, with the majority of their workers paid at least $16 an hour and just 9% below $15 an hour. Bill Thompson of Independence, Missouri, has worked at Burger King for 10 years, but makes just $11.15 an hour and has received wage increases only from state minimum wage increases. “I work 40 hours or more a week, 10 hours a day, no breaks,” said Thompson, who has been involved in organizing with the Fight for $15 and a union movement. “The toll on my health has been significant. I can’t afford to see a doctor and when I have a health condition, I have to rely on emergency room services. Many days, I just work through it because there is no paid sick leave and I work paycheck to paycheck.” In 2021, Thompson had to take six weeks off, all unpaid, while his mother was dying of cancer in hospice care at home. He had to rely on local food pantries to keep food in her house through her final days. “This is America, but no one should live like this,” Thompson said. More than half of workers at Dunkin’ Donuts, Starbucks, Chick-Fil-A, Domino’s, IHop, GameStop, Chipotle, Jimmy John’s, Best Western, Bath & Body Works, Cracker Barrel, Gap, Food Lion, Kohl’s, Hannaford, Lowe’s, Marriott, Marshalls, Meijer, Michaels, Panera Bread, Papa John’s, Publix, Rite Aid, Ross, Speedway, Stop & Shop, Subway, Tractor Supply Co, Victoria’s Secret, Waffle House, Walgreens, Walmart and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts are paid less than $15 an hour. The majority of workers at all 66 firms included in the project are paid $20 an hour or less, representing at least 10.7 million workers. The federal minimum wage in the US has remained $7.25 an hour since 2009, while a living wage in the US as calculated by MIT was set at $16.54 an hour for a family of four with two working adults in 2019. According to a 2021 report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a worker needs to make at least $20.40 an hour to afford the rent of the average one-bedroom apartment in the US. Daniel Schneider, co-director of the Shift Project, a joint project at Harvard Kennedy School and University of California, San Francisco, who co-developed the wage tracker, explained the tracker was created to help fill a data hole in not just the average wages at top retail and food service firms, but insight into the distribution of those wages. “None of these firms are transparent when it comes to wages, which is why we found the need to put this data out there. It’s very hard to find any public information from firms about how much they pay their workers, let alone on the distributions of those wages,” said Schneider. He also noted that in addition to the low wages many of these firms pay, the job quality is poor in terms of the lack of benefits, paid time off, erratic scheduling and insufficient hours. “That’s not just low pay, it’s a recipe for material hardship. That’s an economic context that can lead workers to not being able to afford enough to eat or keep up with utility bills,” he said. “There’s a long way to go for most of the employers on this list when it comes to job quality. But the data really shows that there is a higher road strategy available to employers, if they’re willing to take it.” These corporations generate billions of dollars in revenue annually and pay CEOs and executives multimillion-dollar salaries every year. Todd Vasos, CEO of Dollar General, received compensation worth $16.4m in 2021 and McDonald’s CEO, Christopher Kempczinski, received compensation worth $20m. The data on wages were compiled from more than 20,000 workers at the 66 corporations included in the tracker, with an average of 317 respondents for each company, with interviews conducted between March 2021 and November 2021.",News/US news,"Most workers at large retail and food corporations receive less than $15 an hour, study shows",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/19/how-much-retail-food-companies-pay-workers-per-hour
4/19/2022,"One of the most important works of Handel’s Italian period, La Resurrezione was first performed privately, on Easter Day in 1708, in the house of one of the composer’s Roman patrons. It’s a remarkable piece in some ways. The subject in itself is unusual: depictions of the resurrection are comparatively rare in music, as indeed they are in art, almost as if approaching the central mystery of Christianity were in some ways at the limits of human imagination. Handel’s treatment is oblique, albeit striking. A supernatural colloquy between Lucifer and an Angel describes the harrowing of hell, while on Earth, saints John the Evangelist, Mary Magdalene and Mary Cleophas anxiously await the dawn that will reveal Christ’s tomb to be empty. As so often in Handel, however, there is an underlying sense of God’s glory reflected in the physical wonder of creation, and the textual equation of Christ with the sun paves the way for an astonishingly beautiful depiction of natural renewal after the harshness of winter. The resulting sensuous immediacy very much predominated in Easter Monday’s performance by the London Handel Orchestra under Laurence Cummings, part of both the London Handel festival and the Easter festival at St Martin-in-the-Fields. Cummings proved an exacting judge of the sometimes tricky balance between drama and reflection, teasing out instrumental detail as he went – the woodwind that alternately grieve and console, the warmth in the strings, the gleam in the brass that eventually heralds the triumph of light over darkness. There was some wonderful singing, too. Nardus Williams sounded ravishing as Mary Magdalene, her rapt introspection contrasted with the bravura brilliance of Helen Charlston’s Mary Cleophas. Rachel Redmond’s Angel showered Callum Thorpe’s sullen, gritty-voiced Lucifer with volleys of gleefully precise coloratura. And as John the Evangelist, Ed Lyon sang with burnished tone and deep sincerity, bringing an ecstatic quality to Ecco Il Sol Ch’Esce Dal Mare that arguably made it the emotional high point of a fine and rewarding evening.",Arts/Music,La Resurrezione review – wonderful singing takes Handel into the ecstatic,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/19/la-resurrezione-review-st-martin-in-the-fields-london-handel
4/19/2022,"As the curtain came down on Napoli’s 1-1 draw with Roma, Lorenzo Insigne turned and booted a water bottle back toward his bench. His body language spoke less of rage than resignation. The player’s hopes of leaving his boyhood club with a Serie A title as a parting gift had already dimmed with defeat to Fiorentina in the previous round. Still, this was a day that could have belonged to him. Insigne’s well-taken penalty put Napoli ahead for 80 minutes. A win would at least have kept them in touching distance of the summit. Instead, someone else had taken hold of the narrative. Not Stephan El Shaarawy, who scored the injury-time equaliser – firing past Alex Meret at the end of a scintillating move, in which nine Roma players touched the ball and the last five only once each – but an inevitable José Mourinho. The manager had made headlines before kick-off, when he went to lay flowers at the shrine to Diego Maradona in Naples’s Spanish Quarter. Mourinho has spoken before about their friendship, telling BT Sport how the Argentinian used to call him after defeats but never wins. Their conversations would have been few, if Maradona were still with us, in 2022. Mourinho’s Roma have lost only twice since 9 January and one of those hardly counts – a 2-1 defeat in the first-leg of their Europa Conference League quarter-final with Bodo Glimt, overturned by a 4-0 victory in Thursday’s return. They are unbeaten in 12 Serie A matches, the longest ongoing run in the division. At the start of the year, questions were being asked about what Mourinho had done to justify Roma’s decision to hire him and pay him the joint-best salary in the league. His team were 11 points worse off than at the corresponding stage last season. Despite a summer transfer spend of more than €100m, Mourinho responded to a 6-1 thrashing by Bodo Glimt in the Conference League group stage by saying he had only “12 or 13” players worthy of the team. The last three months have turned the story on its head, Roma improving so drastically as to give themselves an outside shot at a Champions League spot. A win over Napoli on Sunday would have pulled them to within three points of Juventus in fourth. Mourinho has adapted his tactics, showing greater willingness to press opponents high and play on the front foot. He has made changes to how individual players are used, notably bringing Nicolò Zaniolo in from the wing to operate more often as a second striker behind Tammy Abraham – even if there had still been media laments about the Italian’s lack of playing time before a hat-trick in Thursday’s win over Bodo Glimt. 🛣️ 𝐆𝐎𝐀𝐋: This is the way 💁🏻‍♂️ #NapoliRoma #SerieA 💎 @ASRomaEN @OfficialEl92 pic.twitter.com/d4zp7M9UQy Most of all, though, Mourinho’s greatest success might have been to achieve something that eluded him in recent stints at Manchester United and Tottenham: persuading players to buy in. Roma’s defining trait over the last three-and-a-half months has not been dazzling football – though there have been flashes of that – but simply a refusal to quit. El Shaarawy’s strike was the Giallorossi’s seventh injury-time goal of this season and their 15th inside the last quarter-hour of a game. Against last-placed Salernitana in their previous league game, they trailed until the 82nd minute before recovering to win. Lorenzo Pellegrini’s equaliser against Udinese last month arrived in the 93rd. Abraham earned a win over Spezia with a penalty in the 98th. That tenacity was in evidence again as they fought to stay in Sunday’s game despite a rocky start. Napoli looked far sharper in the opening exchanges, Mario Rui overlapping effectively with Insigne down the left and Hirving Lozano carving through the lines on the right. It was the Mexican who won the penalty with a run beyond Ibañez, who caught his heel in a rush to recover. Milan 2-0 Genoa, Spezia 1-3 Inter, Lazio 1-1 Torino, Juventus 1-1 Bologna, Fiorentina 1-0 Venezia, Udinese 4-1 Empoli, Sampdoria 1-2 Salernitana, Cagliari 1-0 Sassuolo, Atalanta 1-2 Verona, Napoli 1-1 Roma Yet Roma gave up few clear-cut chances beyond that, and might have had goals of their own on the counter if Zaniolo had shown just a little more clarity of thought – holding the ball when he should have squared it for Abraham and looking for a pass when he appeared to have a chance to go beyond wrong-footed defenders on his own. Through the second half, Roma only got stronger. Abraham should have equalised but made a poor connection on a close-range header. Napoli invited them on, Luciano Spalletti withdrawing first Lozano and Fabián Ruiz, then Insigne and Victor Osimhen. El Shaarawy’s goal arrived late, but it felt more than deserved. Mourinho’s praise for his players at full-time was embedded into an extended lament about perceived refereeing injustice. His argument that the Napoli full-back Alessandro Zanoli could have been sent off for a pair of reckless challenges felt justified. The claim that Roma should have had a penalty when Zaniolo collided with Meret was more ambiguous. The keeper made an excellent save in the first instance but then collided with the striker, who perhaps could have reached the ball otherwise. “It seemed impossible to me to leave here with a positive result, even though my team did not just play well but extremely well,” said Mourinho. “After Thursday’s game, and against a great team like Napoli, this match seemed like Everest, but we had quality, character, physical and mental conditioning that were absolutely incredible. We wanted more, but it was impossible. In football both teams have the right to play to win matches, whether they are fighting for the Scudetto, fifth place or to avoid relegation. This time they took that right away from us.” Opinions will differ on individual decisions but might also be beside the point. Mourinho was leaning into his players’ sense of injustice, just as he has at previous clubs, to bond them together, selling them a story about ‘us against the world’. That approach has been enthusiastically received in Rome from the start. Mourinho was popular with fans even before results started to turn in his team’s favour. A surge up the table and a push to the semi-final of a European competition – even if not the most glamorous one – is welcomed as vindication by those who believed from the start. On Saturday Roma go away to Inter, the team with whom Mourinho won the Treble in 2010 and who now sit second in the table – two points behind their neighbours Milan with a game in hand. He may not be in the running for a Scudetto of his own, but once again the Portuguese finds himself holding a quill as the final chapter of a Serie A season is committed to the page.",Sport/Football,Roma on the rise as Mourinho’s ‘us against the world’ mentality pays off | Nicky Bandini,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/19/roma-on-the-rise-as-jose-mourinho-us-against-the-world-mentality-pays-off-serie-a
4/19/2022,"Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Better Call Saul season six, which airs on Netflix in the UK. Do not read on unless you have watched episodes one and two. Welcome to the Guardian’s recaps of the final season of Better Call Saul. This late addition to the golden age of TV finishes in 2022 after seven years, a pandemic and a near-death experience for its star. The final 13 episodes will be shown in two blocks between now and July and we start with a double bill – Wine and Roses followed by Carrot and Stick – both of which are discussed here. I hope you enjoy and, as ever, these recaps work best when there is engaged and informed commentary above and below the line, so please do get stuck in. We’ll get to Jimmy and Kim soon enough but, in these opening episodes, the heat is to be found in the desert. Nacho Varga (Michael Mando) is as on the run as a man can be: literally dashing for miles through the scrub to try to escape the consequences of his actions. He thinks he’s hiding from the responsibility of killing Lalo Salamanca. We know he’s actually being chased by the man himself. Nacho finally holes up in the decrepit Motel Ocotillo after bundling over a wall and taking silent receipt of some keys from a landlady who’s seen it all before and has a creaking rocking chair. From there, Nacho begins several days of increasing paranoia, and with good reason. Having survived his assassination attempt, the inexorable Lalo (Tony Dalton) appears to be of the mind that revenge is a dish best served cold. On escaping the bloodbath he visits a family friend and cajoles him into shaving off his beard, before killing him so he can double as his corpse on the crime scene. (At least, that was my reading of it.) With his death confirmed, Lalo can take his time. He has not just Nacho but Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) in his sights and chooses to turn down a trip across the US border in a hay bale to take time to do things properly and find prueba of the Chicken Man’s involvement in the botched hit. We don’t see all that much of Lalo in the first two episodes, which only heightens the menace. There’s certainly enough to get Nacho jumping at shadows, until those shadows become real people with singsong voices sitting in an abandoned hut and staking him out for Fring. He, via Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), has also tipped the cartel off as to Nacho’s whereabouts, all of which predictably ends up in an exchange of hot lead under the noonday sun. But Nacho survives, even blasting his way through the unusually lethargic-looking Cousins, as he busts out of the motel compound to go on the run once more. Back in Albuquerque, Fring doesn’t believe Lalo is dead and doesn’t care if Nacho is alive or dead. Mike is testing Fring’s patience to the limit by not only offering to pick up Nacho from the desert but refusing to offer up the kid’s honest ol’ papa as a sacrifice. Last thing we see, Mike’s phone goes and it’s Nacho wanting to speak to Fring. A monosyllabic conversation with multiple layers of hidden menace seems likely to follow. And so, to our hero. And our heroine. A couple who are ever more intertwined and occasionally interchangeable. Gone are the days of Jimmy slippy, Kim squeaky clean, or at least it appears that way. They are both four square behind a plan to liberate the Sandpiper settlement money via the mechanism of destroying Howard’s career (see below), and they’re also both dipping liberally into a bag of cartel cash to cover costs. At the same time, Kim is buzzing over her work in the pro-bono sector and Jimmy isn’t keeping any secrets. What are we to make of that? Well, as much as everyone is looking forward to the arrival of Walter White and Jesse Pinkman in their own prequel, the resolution of Kim and Jimmy’s relationship is the big uncertain plot line of this final season. Kim’s not in Breaking Bad, so where does she go? Is she killed, betrayed, disillusioned? Or does she just keepherself to herself while Saul Goodman does Fring’s bidding for a few years? Could Gene Takovic even be cohabiting? I await the outcome with great trepidation, especially because she and Jimmy look as thick as thieves. Betsy and Craig Kettleman are dragged from their peaceable lives diddling pensioners out of tax rebates to become an essential cog in Jimmy and Kim’s big howard conspiracy in the second episode, Carrot and Stick. First appearing in season one, the family of embezzlers served as an example of Jimmy’s nose for taking on cases that are morally dubious but potentially lucrative. They also featured recently in a pre-season clip, professing their probity in a nicely sleazy 60 Minutes style mockumentary clip that is not only a bit kitsch, but is voiced by Stacy Keach). A couple of years since we last saw them, the couple remain anything but the decent hardworking people they make themselves out to be. They’re running a tax scam for a start. But the actual facts are of secondary importance to how the Kettlemans, and wife, Betsy, in particular, perceive reality – and her pugnacity has always made a good foil for Jimmy’s slippery instincts. Kim and Jimmy’s wheeze is to get Craig, and to a greater extent Betsy, to further peddle the rumour that Howard Hamlin is a cocaine user (one set up in Wine and Roses with an elaborate golf club baggie drop). Only by artfully keeping the information out of Betsy’s greedy reach does Jimmy first pique her interest and, then, once he passes it on, he relies on her hatred for him to act as lubricant to the process. A desire to use Jimmy’s secret against him takes Betsy and Craig straight to the top of Davis & Main, precisely where Jimmy wants them to go, as it was Clifford Main who spotted Howard’s baggie with familiar weariness in episode one. Betsy soon realises she’s been played and even works out Jimmy’s ruse. But Kim bails Jimmy out with her Lalo voice again, and the Kettlemans’ new scam will be exposed to the IRS if Betsy doesn’t shut up. They duly take the hint (and a little sweetener from Jimmy’s desert bag), and the family that has served as a delicious little symbol of the greed that exists outside the normal parameters of the “criminal world” are left to contemplate their choices. There is no Gene Takovic cameo to intro the season. It might be my eyesight but I think the opening shot of a load of ties being put into a government-owned bin transitions from black and white (Gene world) to colour, so maybe that’s a nod, but we appear to currently be denied any further update on what is going on now in Jimmy’s world. Hmmm. In terms of cinematography, we get a lovely bit of gaming footage, first going inside Kaylee’s marble set and then taking a domino eye’s view of one of Nacho’s tweaking girlfriends. The kind of innovative angles that have always been the hallmark of first Breaking Bad and now BCS, they also serve as a counterpoint between the innocence of Kaylee’s world (the protection of which is Mike’s only goal in life) and the damage that’s wreaked on others by the drug trade. Finally, farewell to the “World’s 2nd best lawyer (again)” mug. You weren’t around for long, but you saw a lot. May you finally find peace in that trash can (via some top notch three point shooting from Kim).",Arts/Television & radio,"Better Call Saul recap: season six, episodes one and two – watch out Howard!

4/19/2022,"Oleksandr Malish, the patrol police chief for the cities of Kramatorsk and Slovyansk in the Donetsk region, is reluctant to call people suspected of collaborating with Russia Ukrainians. “I cannot even call these people Ukrainians, even though they have Ukrainian passports and were born here and lived here all their lives,” said Malish. “These are not professional spies who were trained in Moscow and sent here.” The two cities he oversees are in the pocket of the Donetsk region still controlled by Ukraine but surrounded by Russian forces on three sides. Part of his team’s job is rooting out and detaining suspected collaborators. Pro-Russian feeling still exists, he said, especially among marginalised sections of the population. Malish said there were pro-Russia Telegram groups with the “Z” branding that were targeting residents. The administrator of the Telegram group would put out a notice asking for coordinates or photos of a certain place in exchange for money. When a person sent the “goods” to the administrator, they received up to £500 on their bank card, Malish said. He said his team had found evidence of such Telegram exchanges and bank transfers on the phones of “numerous” suspected collaborators they had detained. He said declined to say exactly how many. The Guardian was not able to find the Telegram groups Malish described. But it did find public Telegram groups for Kramatorsk and Slovyansk with “Z” branding that carry pro-Russia messaging about the war. The groups have about 15,000 subscribers. The Guardian was not able to confirm that they were all genuine residents of the two cities and neighbouring villages, though some appeared to be. Malish said police were asked by residents to inspect a man on Saturday. When they searched his phone, he said, they saw he had received about £400 from a Russian bank account on 8 April. As the man was not able to explain the transfer, and the Kramatorsk railway station was hit the same day, they decided to detain him as a suspect. More than half the cities’ populations have left. According to one lieutenant patrol officer on duty, Ihor Yunusov, this makes it easier for the police to identify suspicious behaviour. “If before there could be 500 people on the main square in the evening, now there are around 10,” Yunusov said. Driving around Kramatorsk, the police struggled to find cars or people to inspect in the deserted city. Instead, they took the Guardian to see the damage from a double rocket attack apparently intended for the Kramatorsk regional security services headquarters. One of the rockets was caught by Ukrainian anti-aircraft systems and exploded between the security services building and an apartment block. The second rocket, which hit in succession, landed in a children’s nursery empty because of the war. One of the three officers on patrol that day, Volodymyr Filonenko, lived in one of the 40 buildings that were damaged in the two attacks. Filonenko had just evacuated his wife and two children from the building.",News/World news,Police scout for pro-Russian collaborators in eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/19/police-scout-for-pro-russian-collaborators-in-eastern-ukraine
4/19/2022,"The atmosphere does not react to pledges for the future or reports about past achievements. It only reacts to real emission reductions. The research published in Nature last week showing that the pledges by countries to reduce emissions made since the Paris agreement could keep warming within 2C, if met on time, has therefore understandably sparked a series of conflicting reactions. Outrage that even if the promises are met, they don’t come close to 1.5C; and optimism that 2C is such a huge improvement on where we’d be headed without the Paris agreement. On the one hand, we have to acknowledge this looks very much like failure. A 2C world will not be livable for vast swathes of humanity, and half of the world’s children are already at extremely high risk from the impacts now, including hunger-inducing floods and droughts. A 2C future may even lead us into conditions that insurers would deem uninsurable for practically all businesses and homes, and that’s only if the pledges are met. There will never be a shortage of excuses for slippage on these promises. The atrocious invasion of Ukraine, which has brought our deadly addiction to Russian oil and gas into shocking view, is just one of them. Short-term arguments to push decarbonisation down the road will always find a way to rise back above the parapet. On the other hand, we have to agree that this new projection based on national commitments portends a far better outcome than we would get without them. Bending the curve of future emissions down – from 4.5C or higher as it was projected to be in 2015 – to within the stated goal of the agreement would be a huge improvement. This is a real result stemming from the difficult, intricate and decades-long multilateral process of negotiations as well as from the power of the decreasing costs of clean technologies. The Paris agreement is working, even if not fast enough. This process has been enabled at every turn by extraordinary momentum for action from all sectors of society, activism of all stripes from all corners of the globe and individual leadership. It’s also just the start: once action unleashed by these commitments begins to really kick in, and the non-state actor community continues pushing their additional pledges, the progress will quickly become exponential. So we are caught between two truths, and two deep feelings in our bones: outrage and optimism. Both are valid responses and both are necessary. Those in the community who have contributed to the provenance and ongoing implementation of any commitment to reduce emissions – national or corporate – would do themselves a great service by celebrating the tectonic shift. I know that these pledges are nearly always the result of dogged hard work and determination combined with deep-seated effort to develop a shared understanding and collective action. Yes, they are not yet enough, but behind each one are individuals who share the increasing pain about the ecological devastation we are witnessing and the anxiety about what we will continue to lose as a result of unambitious choices. Celebrating what we have on the table so far doesn’t mean we should not continue to challenge the commitments made, ensure their base in the latest science and call for proper accountability. After all businesses and governments pledging action cheat all of us, including themselves, by saying one thing and doing another. Integrity and transparency must be at the heart of all efforts. Delving into the actual work going on on the ground is absolutely inspiring. I know this first-hand from working closely with the Climate Pledge, in which 300 companies are aiming to accelerate solutions to the climate crisis and reach net zero by 2040. There is a treasure trove of future possibility burgeoning, even as we constantly read of new fossil fuel projects the atmosphere cannot afford being developed. By assuming one reaction or the other – outrage or optimism – we force ourselves into a box. We risk reducing our thinking and acting according to a binary mentality that can drive polarisation at a time where acting in solidarity with each other is ever more important. The complexity of the climate crisis and its solutions mean we need to get used to holding complex emotional reactions, and to pursuing complex solutions. The path ahead will be full of outrage and optimism. We can use both of those to push for the policies we know we need: policies that will enable every commitment and pledge to reduce emissions to be met not just on time, but ahead of schedule.
