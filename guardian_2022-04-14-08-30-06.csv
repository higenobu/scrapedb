4/14/2022,"Pep Guardiola claimed that he had never criticised Atlético Madrid’s style, after a tense, edgy night which ended with Manchester City hanging on to a one-goal lead to reach the Champions League semi‑finals and a fight in the tunnel. But Diego Simeone, the Atlético manager, did not appear to be buying Guardiola’s explanation, insisting: “We’re not stupid.” Koke Resurrección, Atlético’s captain, accused City of “falling on the floor and wasting time”, just as Atlético had been accused of doing, something that was admitted afterwards by the midfielder Rodri, who noted “everything’s licit in football” but insisted it was only the case in the final “five to 10 minutes”. There had been a mass confrontation in the corner just before the final whistle. And Simeone denied he had sarcastically applauded the City bench, insisting he was clapping the fans. There was also trouble in the tunnel, with the police forced to intervene. Footage showed Stefan Savic and Jack Grealish confront each other while Sime Vrsaljko had to be held back as he could be seen throwing something and spitting at City staff. Asked about that footage, Guardiola replied: “Nothing to say.” Simeone said he had not been there and not seen anything. City’s manager did, though, respond to suggestions that it was ironic that he had adopted the approach Atlético had been accused of, by insisting those accusations had not come from him. At the end of the first leg Guardiola had noted that “ever since prehistory” it has been hard to face a team that defends very deep with two lines of five, words that were interpreted as a dig by many in Spain, perhaps even including Simeone himself. “I have only ever had good words to say about him,” Guardiola said after the second leg. “He can play however he wants, of course. I would never say otherwise. All I said was that it is very hard. And they know how to do that better than anyone in the world.” Asked if Guardiola had shown a lack of respect, Simeone said: “I don’t have to offer an opinion about whether someone is speaking well [of us] or not. Often, those who are very eloquent are very intelligent and have a way of praising you dismissively. But those of us who maybe have less eloquence are not stupid.” In the end, City had to hang on to a lead, seeking to run down the clock to find a way through. “We had no other choice,” Guardiola said. “Atlético were absolutely brilliant. I don’t like playing that way at all but this team [Atlético] playing like his with their people behind them are almost unstoppable. All I said was that when a team plays that way very, very well, it’s very difficult. Nothing else. “Don’t be mistaken, I never criticised Atlético,” Guardiola said. “They pushed us back, we forgot how to play. That’s to their credit. We’re celebrating going through but after that second half we could be out. We were in big, big trouble. They had chances to score, but they didn’t in the end. “If we play in the semi-final like we did in the second half, we don’t have any chance.” Atlético’s captain, Koke, pointed out that City’s players went to ground to waste time in the second half. “Lots of the time we get criticised for this situation, and now let’s see what people think of this today,” he said. “You’ve seen it, you can express an opinion.” Rodri said: “Everything is licit in football. We tried to play. It’s true that in the end, because of the quality of your opponent, we were boxed in and when there are five or 10 minutes left you play with that weapon [time wasting]. I am not in favour of doing it the rest of the time, but in the end sometimes it happens. When that [the melee] happened, I tried to stay out of it; it’s my team mates and my ex-teammates and it is not at all pleasant for me.” “We played surely the best team in the best team in the world and we competed,” Simeone concluded. “Football has many facets, ways of playing, and I am not going to have an opinion on what our opponents’ behaviour was like.”",Sport/Football,"‘I never criticised Atlético,’ says Guardiola after City squeeze into semi-finals",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/i-never-criticised-atletico-says-guardiola-after-city-squeeze-into-semi-finals
4/14/2022,"A London teacher has been awarded £850,000 in compensation after being punched in the face and kicked during a science lesson by a pupil with a history of violence towards other children and teachers. The attack was so severe it left him with severe psychological trauma that resulted in him being sectioned twice under the Mental Health Act for his own safety, according to his trade union, the NASUWT. He has been unable to return to the classroom since and medical experts say he is unlikely to work as a teacher again, hence the size of the settlement which is thought to be a record in a case of this kind. The teacher worked for an academy chain whose insurers will foot the bill. The incident happened in January 2017 while the teacher was taking a science class at an unidentified academy in the capital. “Following a previous incident, the pupil was suspended for three days and I was reassured that they would no longer take part in my classes,” the teacher said in an account of the attack published on the NASUWT website. However, when the pupil was back at school, he turned up in class. “When I saw him at the beginning of class, I made the point that he shouldn’t be there and asked him to leave and he walked out and shut the door,” said the teacher, who asked not to be identified. “I then had my back to the door and hadn’t realised that he’d come back into the room. The rest is a bit of a blur as he attacked me again. The worst thing is that the school knew this pupil was a danger. It wasn’t the first time he had been violent – he had been violent to both other children and teachers.” The teacher suffered physical and psychological injuries as a result of the career-ending attack, including a head injury, tinnitus, hearing loss, bruising, back and ankle injuries, as well as PTSD and severe depressive disorder. The £850,000 personal injury award was part of £15m compensation the NASUWT secured for its members last year in a range of cases including unfair dismissal, discrimination, bullying, trade union-related detriment and health and safety. Details of the case and the settlement reached were unveiled on Thursday on the eve of the NASUWT national conference in Birmingham over the Easter weekend. In a separate case, a drama teacher from Wales was awarded almost £80,000 after being dismissed from her job since developing life-threatening asthma following the refurbishment of her classroom in 2013. There were a number of problems following the refurbishment, with mould on the classroom walls and a crack in the floor. The teacher began to suffer from persistent headaches, rhinitis, coughing and wheezing while teaching and eventually had an asthma attack at school and was taken by ambulance to hospital where she was diagnosed with late-onset asthma, likely to have been caused by her working conditions. The NASUWT succeeded in bringing claims for unfair dismissal and disability discrimination. Dr Patrick Roach, NASUWT general secretary, said: “While compensation is recognition of the personal and, in some cases, financial loss that members have suffered, it can never make up for the impact which unfair treatment, discrimination and physical injuries have on individuals. “The money awarded cannot compensate for the emotional, physical and mental distress members have experienced and the fact that, for some, their experiences have left them unable to continue working in teaching.” He said these cases were likely to be the tip of the iceberg. “There is no doubt that many other teachers will have been driven out of the profession without proper redress for poor, discriminatory or unfair treatment because they were too fearful to come forward or believed nothing could be done.”",News/Education,"London teacher awarded £850,000 after pupil’s attack",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/14/london-teacher-awarded-850000-after-pupils-attack
4/14/2022,"Private rents in Britain are rising at a record rate, research has found, jumping 14% in a year in London and by more than 19% in hotspots such as Manchester, piling yet more pressure on already strained household budgets. The average advertised rent outside London is 10.8% higher than a year ago as tenants grappled with “the most competitive rental market ever recorded”, said the property website Rightmove. This is the first time the average annual growth outside the capital has exceeded 10%, increasing average rent to a record £1,088 a month – up from £982 a year ago. In London, which temporarily fell out of favour with renters earlier on in the pandemic, the average asking rent hit a record £2,193 a month – up 14.3%, or £274, on a year ago. Rightmove said this was “the biggest annual jump of any region since records began”. The property site said demand was greatly exceeding supply, with prospective tenants outnumbering available rental properties by more than three to one. This has been blamed on a number of factors, some pandemic-related, with many tenants continuing to re-evaluate what they want from a home and how close they need to live to work. Rightmove said it was also hearing from agents and landlords that tenants were signing longer leases, which was preventing some of the stock that would normally come back on to the market from doing so. Soaring house prices have meant many would-be homebuyers have had to stay in rented accommodation for longer, while many landlords who were originally attracted by the buy-to-let boom have in recent years hiked rents or quit the market owing to regulatory and tax changes. Overall, average rents are now 15% higher than during the same period two years ago, just as the pandemic started. The hikes coincide with higher energy bills and other living costs. The website named a number of rental hotspots, with Swansea in south Wales topping the table with a 19.7% annual rise in typical asking rents. Manchester was close behind, with a 19.3% increase, the average monthly rent up from £894 to £1,067 in a year. Liverpool was another hotspot, with a 17.1% annual rise. Others included Margate in Kent (18.8%), Grantham in Lincolnshire (14.6%) and Cardiff (14.5%). The figures came a day after a report from an influential committee of MPs said more than one in eight privately rented homes in England posed a serious threat to people’s health and safety. An estimated 11 million people rent privately in England , and the sector has doubled in size during the past 20 years. Separately, the Office for National Statistics published data that showed average UK house prices increased by 10.9% over the 12 months to February - up from 10.2% in the year to January. That lifted the typical price to £277,000 – about £27,000 higher than a year earlier.",Lifestyle/Money,"Cost of renting jumps at record, adding more pressure to cost of living crisis",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/14/private-rents-britain-rose-record-rate-past-year-swansea-manchester-london
4/14/2022,"And so it came to pass, with 92 minutes on the clock. A match that had simmered, all smouldering, corseted restraint, finally broke down into the nasty, snarky, theatrically overblown free‑for‑all that everyone at the Wanda Metropolitano always felt was on its way. By the end there was talk of a fist fight involving at least two players and the sight of helmeted police sprinting for the tunnel. There was genuine bad blood on the pitch, words and pointed fingers. And above all the spectacle of Atlético’s players shaking their heads in utter confusion, lost in red mist that felt like someone else’s red mist, self‑Atléticoed, playing that horrible game from the other side. In an excellent narrative twist it was, of all people, Phil Foden who sparked much of this. Yes, really: that Foden, City’s academy-reared flyweight, such an orderly, technical presence, but transformed here, in a match where he did little else of note, into a kind of nemesis, a banshee, a wildly infuriating figure capering about at a peppercorn rent inside the head of the great Diego Simeone. Who knows, this might even turn up being a defining Foden night, for all the right wrong reasons. We know he can play, although here he was pushed to the fringes, moving constantly, never backing down, wearing his bandaged head like a trophy. Instead he did something else; finding a way, not just to really, really, really annoy Atlético Madrid, but to help drag City over the line in a game they were desperate to get to the end of. Best of all Foden completely spooked Simeone, who spent the final minutes of stoppage time wandering around clapping weirdly, nodding his head, smiling horribly, and looking, frankly, a little nuts. It began with some defensive desperation. As the clock ticked down, and with City hanging on at 1-0 up in the tie, Foden set off on a long chase out of defence carrying the ball towards the corner flag, finally brought down by Felipe, who left a leg in on him. At which point, enter: bedlam. Felipe was sent off for the challenge, a second yellow. Stefan Savic was also booked, although apparently not for a very obvious headbutt. Jack Grealish had a piece of it and had his hair pulled (no, not the hair) for his troubles. And by the end, as every member of the Madrid population flooded the pitch in some formal capacity, a match that had passed through, the gullet like a gnarly, gristly piece of mutton finally had its defining interaction. It is a melee that will, if anything, give City great heart. These are the games, after all, that get you there. And it was an odd one from the start. The Wanda Metropolitano is a stunning spectacle on nights like these. The booing of the champions League “anthem” before kick-off was righteously observed (in every part of the ground), as was the taking of the knee, which brought peals of disgusted outrage among the home fans. There was a moment of standalone violence within the first 15 minutes as Felipe came trapeze swinging straight through the back of Foden and left him dazed and cut, and eventually prepared to carry on with a large pink plaster around his head. Otherwise this was furious, full-contact blood and guts, press and counter press. Atlético swarmed in small groups either high up the pitch or in a deep block, vacating the midfield at times. Every challenge, every duel was contested with the dial turned up to 12. This was the plan. The same, but more of it. Same tune, just louder. City kept on playing through it in that first half, with something quietly regal in their refusal to be cowed. Kevin De Bruyne had a shot blocked on the edge of the box after nice work from Foden. With 29 minutes gone Ilkay Gündogan hit the post from Foden’s pass. And at this point Foden was having a decent game drifting to that side, later rolling a horrible low cross through the six-yard box where the folksy, semi-mythical figure of The Manchester City Centre Forward – some say he has hind legs like a rabbit and stands 12 feet tall – flickered mournfully at the edge of things. With 35 minutes gone something extraordinary happened. Atlético had a shot, their first in the tie. Geoffrey Kondogbia’s effort was easily held. He sprinted back toward the halfway line guiltily. But they did change gear after half-time. Finally, we had the version behind the version, the team that wants to play this game. There were forward surges, overlaps. For a while the game seemed to break down into Atlético playing ambitious balls over the top and Ederson repeatedly rushing out to perform his cartwheeling high‑wire act, the calmest man in the stadium as he scorpion kicks a goalline clearance or somersaults off towards the corner flag . But City did find a way to escape, led by that scampering little academy scoundrel on the left wing. If Foden grew here in a game where he did little otherwise of note, City looked like something else too, a team with the fight and the snark to take this thing a little further towards its end point.",Sport/Football,Scampering scoundrel Phil Foden beats Diego Simeone at his own game | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/13/scampering-scoundrel-phil-foden-beats-diego-simeone-at-his-own-game
4/14/2022,"Jürgen Klopp declared himself delighted to take Liverpool into the Champions League semi-finals for the third time in his reign and said he will never take such achievements for granted. Liverpool gave up a 3-1 lead to draw 3‑3 against Benfica but progressed 6-4 on aggregate with an Ibrahima Konaté header and a Roberto Firmino brace securing a date with Villarreal in the last four. Klopp made seven changes ahead of the FA Cup semi-final with Manchester City on Saturday and blamed himself for the defensive difficulties of a back four who had never played together before. “It was not exactly what we wanted but it is absolutely not important because if we played the best game of the season it wouldn’t have made it more likely to get to the final,” he said. “We never take something like this for granted. I am really happy. I know people talk about goals conceded but the day I am not over the moon about getting to the Champions League semi-final, something is really wrong.” Klopp confined Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mané, Thiago Alcãntara and Fabinho to cameos and left Virgil van Dijk, Andy Robertson and Trent Alexander-Arnold as unused substitutes. Benfica capitalised on their absence and Klopp said: “They scored really good goals but it should not be as easy as it was tonight. The only problem was when we lost the ball our protection was not perfect. To put the opponent offside didn’t work out too well but that is my fault.” Villarreal eliminated Bayern Munich and Klopp is expecting a difficult game against the Europa League holders. “Over both games Villarreal deserved to get through. They have probably the most successful cup competition manager in world football so he knows what he is doing. Unai Emery is the king of the cups. It is unbelievable what he is doing.”",Sport/Football,‘King of cups’: Klopp wary of Liverpool facing Emery and Villarreal in semis,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/13/x
4/14/2022,"The dream is alive, the dream is still tantalisingly feasible yet agonisingly remote. Liverpool are in a third Champions League semi-final under Jürgen Klopp and if a fantasy for a plethora of reasons but mainly its sheer, basic difficulty, a historic quadruple remains on for the German’s band that blends artists and artisans. On Wednesday it was the turn of the latter coterie. Well, kind of. Klopp rested seven of the star turns who started last week’s 3-1 first leg win at Benfica. There was no Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Mané, Mohamed Salah, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson, Thiago Alcântara or Fabinho. And this after their manager had said: “You can never feel entitled. Clubs and teams who are planning the next stage before a particular round is complete are inviting problems.” This was the big news before kick-off. It wouldn’t backfire would it? Surely not. Especially when Klopp could draft in Roberto Firmino, Joel Matip, Jordan Henderson, James Milner, and Diogo Jota along with Kostas Tsimikas and Joe Gomez. Yet there was a certain rustiness initially. The awkward stutter of gears that usually mesh smoothly. By way of example: a Jota swoop into the area ended with his backside hitting turf; a Milner free-kick lollipopped into the wall; Firmino’s angled tap back to Tsimikas proved a geometrically awry. But, then, Klopp’s pack-shuffle began to cast him as a sagacious seer via an opener that was close to a carbon of Liverpool’s first in Portugal. A corner, from the left? Check. A downward header at the far post? Check. From Ibrahima Konaté? Check a third time. Seventeen minutes at Estadio Da Luz, 21 here at Anfield. The only difference was the impressive Tsimikas delivered the dead ball, not Robertson. This was 4-1 and had the Kop regaling their beloved red men with “We shall not be moved”. But they were. Milner inadvertently slashed the ball to Gonçalo Ramos (keeping him onside) and the No 88 arrowed the ball beyond Alisson and in. This was against the momentum, with the possession stats showing a 67.5% share to Liverpool. Only complacency might cause their downfall but there appeared zero chance of this as Benfica took the haymaker of Firmino’s strike on 56 minutes which was followed immediately by Klopp administering the follow-up winding-blows of introducing Salah, Fabinho and Thiago. Firmino added another, Klopp punched the air, then repeated his substitution trick: this time the effervescent Luis Díaz was taken off and Mané was on. Anfield was in fine voice. “Mo Salah, Mo Salah” came the chants from around a venue well-versed in European nights like this one. This was tie over – apparently, despite Roman Yaremchuk snatching a second for the visitors a few minutes later. And now came a late twist, a quickening of home heart-rates. Darwin Nunez scored again for Benfica to make it 3-3 on the night, pulling the aggregate back to 6-4. That was bookended by two other offside strikes before the final whistle sounded and Liverpool were through having never endured any real peril. Next up will be Villarreal. Before then, Klopp and his men fly down to Wembley to face-off against Manchester City for a second time in seven days as they continue the (surely impossible, no?) quest of pulling off a clean sweep of trophies. In the Premier League Liverpool trail City by a point with seven matches left each and they have already secured the Carabao Cup. In this competition, one serious threat in Bayern Munich went out on Tuesday, leaving Pep Guardiola’s team, Real Madrid and Villarreal. In Klopp’s first season Liverpool beat the Spanish club in the Europa League last four and lost the final to a Sevilla managed by their now No 1, Unai Emery, who plotted Bayern’s downfall. He and Liverpool will be wary. Villarreal claimed last year’s Europa League and Emery is a continental cup specialist: he has two other winners medals in the second tier competition (with Sevilla) but to take on a seventh-placed La Liga side who stand 26 points off the leaders, Real, is about as good as it gets in any bid to reach a European Cup final. This had been a lovely April evening that showed, at the start, cloud-dappled skies and a silvery moon. By the end it was dark and clear and Liverpool and their fans could continue to fantasise about doing what no domestic team ever has. It probably will not occur but the excitement is that it might – only might – just happen.",Sport/Football,Klopp’s selection risk pays off as Liverpool move step closer to final | Jamie Jackson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/apr/13/klopps-selection-risk-pays-off-as-liverpool-close-in-on-final
