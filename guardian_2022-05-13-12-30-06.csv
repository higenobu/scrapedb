5/13/2022,"My husband and I have been together for nearly five years, married for two. Last year at a family gathering, my eldest sister witnessed me giving my husband a quick peck on the cheek and flew into a homophobic-tinged rage, accusing us of “rubbing our relationship in her face”. Being a queer couple, I felt like her anger was disproportionate to the level of affection publicly displayed (this was a quick peck, not a prolonged session of tonsil tennis). The rest of the family was shocked, but no one came to our defence. It was humiliating. I was left with feelings of internalised homophobia I thought I’d worked through in my early 20s. I feel anxious even holding my husband’s hand in public now. My sister has not apologised, and I have heard through another family member that most of the family have sided with her, due to her history of depression and recent divorce. They (sister included) are all in denial of the homophobic nature of her outburst and have implied that I am being overly sensitive (they’re not entirely wrong). My husband thinks I should cut them out of my life, but before I do anything drastic, is there a way to bring this up with them that is constructive for all parties involved? Eleanor says: I’m sorry you had to go through that. It’s awful to realise the people we thought would defend us weren’t as brave as we hoped. You asked if there was a way to bring this up that would feel productive. I wonder whether it might be useful, in conversations with your family, to separate impact from intent. Based on what you’ve written, I’m inclined to agree that homophobia was simmering in what your sister did – the old chestnut of “rubbing in my face” sounds a lot like “but why do you have to do it in public?”. Unfortunately, one of the more insidious features of homophobia – like ableism or racism or any other prejudice – is that the people who most enact it often recognise it the least. Right after saying something straight from the homophobia playbook, they’ll insist they don’t have the feelings you’re accusing them of, that there’s no animus; that prejudice plays no role in their mental life. It’s like watching a marionette swear they’re moving on their own. This makes a dilemma for someone in your position: do you litigate the case that they do seem to have the feelings they disavow? Or do you focus on telling them how they’ve hurt you instead? It’s annoying, but I wonder whether focusing on how your sister’s action affected you – rather than its origins – might help. It could give you something to say that your family could be more able to hear. For instance, if you’re close enough to feel comfortable telling them, you could share the things they don’t know about how homophobia has coloured your life. Things about how people spoke to you, treated you; why it took this much bravery to hold your husband’s hand and why that feels fragile, even now. If they had a better understanding of why this reopened certain wounds for you, and why they hurt so much in the first place, they might – might – be better able to see why you wanted their help. Sometimes family disputes fracture along these lines: one side trying to say “you really hurt me” and the other indignantly replying “how dare you accuse me of trying to hurt you”. Focusing on what this meant to you regardless of intention might make it feel less like a battle between siblings over who knows the truth, and more like a request for solidarity and understanding. Your family should want to protect you from things that hurt you – whatever your sister really meant, everyone should be able to agree on that. And whether something hurts you isn’t up to them. As to your sister’s circumstances at the moment. Lawyers and ethicists sometimes distinguish between a justification and an excuse. To have a justification for an action means it’s no longer wrong; to have an excuse just means you won’t get in trouble although we all still agree it was bad. With a lot of grace you might think your sister has an excuse. But grace has to run both ways – she should handle your pain and history and with as much consideration as she’s asking for hers. If your family can’t respond to either of these points, your husband may be right – at a certain point, the standard you walk past is the standard you accept.

5/13/2022,"Acclaimed Dhungatti artist Blak Douglas – born Adam Douglas Hill – has won the 2022 Archibald prize, for his portrait of Wiradjuri artist Karla Dickens, titled Moby Dickens. It’s the second time an Indigenous Australian has won the prize in 101 years, after Vincent Namatjira in 2020. Dickens, who is based on Bundjalung country in Lismore, is painted holding buckets while standing ankle-deep in flood water. The 14 flat-bottomed clouds behind her represent the numbers of days and nights that the first flood lasted in Lismore. At 3m by 2m, it’s the largest painting on show at the Archibald exhibition. Douglas, who has been an Archibald finalist seven times, collected the $100,000 prize at the Art Gallery of New South Wales on Friday: “First Nations artists are dealt rough end of the stick,” he said in his speech. “For me it’s time, for us it’s time.” “Karla is my favourite female First Nations artist, we are dear friends, we are birds of a feather when it comes to our sentiment in art, and I really admire the way she pieces together her work,” he said in a statement. “I was there in Lismore immediately after the first deluge … and saw the shock and horror on people’s faces. Karla had just reached a pivotal point in her career and almost immediately the flood catastrophe happened. So, when she should have ordinarily been excited about where her career was going, she was harbouring three families in Lismore as part of her own rescue mission.” Jude Rae was highly commended for her portrait of inventor and engineer Dr Saul Griffith. Nicholas Harding won the $50,000 Wynne prize for landscape painting of Australian scenery or figurative sculpture, with his oil on linen work Eora. Harding has been a Wynne finalist nine times – and is a 19-time finalist of the Archibald prize. Juz Kitson and Lucy Culliton were both highly commended for the Wynne. The $40,000 Sulman prize for best subject painting, genre painting or mural project in oil, acrylic, watercolour or mixed media, was won by Claire Healy and Sean Cordeiro for Raikō and Shuten-dōji, a rendering of the fight between the warrior Raikō and the demon Shuten-dōji, painted on the fuselage of a Vietnam War-era helicopter. On 5 May Sydney-based artist Claus Stangl won the Archibald’s packing room prize – judged by those who unpack and hang the portraits – for his 3D-style portrait of New Zealand film director, writer and actor Taika Waititi. It was the final pick from head packer Brett Cuthbertson, who is retiring after 41 years with the gallery. The Waititi portrait is among 52 hung in this year’s exhibition, including paintings of Helen Garner, Benjamin Law, Peter Garrett and Courtney Act; they were chosen from a selection of more than 800 entries, in a prize judged by the art gallery’s trustees. Twenty Indigenous artists entered the Archibald – a record for the prize – and there were 27 Indigenous finalists among the Archibald, Wynne and Sulman prizes. This year’s Archibald finalist exhibition also includes five vibrant works from Studio A: a Sydney collective of artists with intellectual disability who have had their most successful year to date. The finalists in all three prizes will be exhibited at the Art Gallery of NSW from 14 May to 28 August 2022.",Arts/Art and design,"Archibald prize 2022: Blak Douglas wins $100,000 for portrait of Lismore artist Karla Dickens",https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/may/13/archibald-prize-2022-blak-douglas-wins-100000-for-portrait-of-lismore-artist-karla-dickens
