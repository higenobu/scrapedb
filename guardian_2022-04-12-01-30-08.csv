4/12/2022,"If today’s democracy teaches any lesson it is don’t underestimate populism. Insult it, deride it, excuse it, no-platform it, but it is a serious force in electoral politics. In France, Marine Le Pen has surged into contention for the presidency. Earlier this month, Hungary’s authoritarian Viktor Orbán swept the board. In Russia, albeit in vexed circumstances, Vladimir Putin retains a patriotic hold on opinion. In the US, Donald Trump refuses to disappear. These individuals are in no way the same, but they speak the same message. The message is that party is being supplanted by personality and identity. As relative prosperity rises, voters are taking recourse in prejudice and emotional security. They can distrust outsiders. They can hate globalists, parliamentarians, bureaucrats and liberals, however defined. They want to feel control over their own lives, as Britain’s Boris Johnson ludicrously but successfully offered them in the form of Brexit. They want to like those who purport to lead them. This populism has torn the left-right spectrum apart. Emmanuel Macron won power five years ago as a radical outsider. He has smashed France’s party system – the two old parties scored under 10% at this election. He has proved a determined, even bold, reformer of France’s archaic political economy, modernising its welfare state and easing labour rigidities where his predecessors failed. The supposedly rightwing Le Pen has identified herself with the poor, with reckless pledges of cheaper petrol, higher taxes on the rich and lower ones on the poor. She wants to exclude immigrants from welfare and defy the EU. She has depicted Macron as an insider, the embodiment of Parisian insensitivity towards provincial France, a classic elitist patrician. A defect of presidential constitutions is to promote personality over policy. It puts a premium on the crudities of politics, on likability, naivety and short-termism. As Alexis de Tocqueville said, it promotes the mob over the club. When parties dissolve, so do the disciplines of parliamentary government. Manifestos become meaningless. Competence amounts to no more than getting through the next crisis. Collective responsibility is reduced to loyalty to a leader and an image, witness Johnson’s Britain. Romantics can find in all this a glimmer of a new politics, one more responsive to popular opinion. It is sometimes summed up as the “global village of the internet”, the democracy of the unmoderated platform. In many ways Brexit was its most glaring manifestation, a cry of protest against Europe’s most centralist governing elite. No other EU state has since dared hold such a referendum and even Le Pen has backed off one. As with Trump in the US, give voters an opportunity to speak naked truth to power and they may use it. It is six years since the World Values Survey recorded a plummeting faith in democracy. Less than half of under-50s “believed it was essential to live in a country governed democratically”. In Germany, the US and Japan, between 20% and 40% would opt for a “strong leader who does not have to bother with parliaments and elections”. Conventional politics must confront these truths or die. Group identity must be somehow respected or worldwide immigration will become a torment. Federalism must be installed or separatism will destabilise states everywhere. Parliaments and parties must reform their processes or become irrelevant. The odds are still on France saving itself in two weeks’ time, but its lessons are clear for all to see.

4/12/2022,"The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, has issued a scathing assessment of the former Formula One race director Michael Masi, whose actions were decisive in denying Lewis Hamilton a potential eighth championship last season. Wolff said Masi was a “liability” to the sport, who was disrespectful to drivers and has still failed to acknowledge his culpability despite being removed from his role by the FIA. At the season finale in Abu Dhabi last year Masi’s intervention, improvising with the rules around the safety car and the way cars could unlap themselves, proved key in the title fight between Wolff’s Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen. It allowed Verstappen, on fresh tyres, the chance to attack and pass Hamilton on the final lap, securing his first championship in the process. The subsequent protests from Mercedes came to nothing but the FIA, whose report cited “human error” as playing a part in the process, later removed Masi from his role. The incident has remained highly contentious and four months later it was clear Wolff was still unhappy at Masi and his actions. “He was just immune to any feedback and even today he has not properly reflected that he did something wrong,” he said. “You hear from the drivers and how the drivers’ briefings were conducted [by Masi] and some of the guys said it was almost disrespectful how he treated some of them. There is a promoter of one of the races in the Middle East who said he was so relieved he had gone because he got so much abuse from him.” The FIA’s report fell far short of apportioning blame on Masi, instead noting the pressure he was under and that certain rules were open to “interpretation”. The furore has rumbled on ever since, distracting from what was one of F1’s classic seasons. Hamilton has acknowledged Verstappen did nothing wrong and acted as any driver would in the circumstances but Wolff pointedly noted the manner of his victory and the Dutchman’s achievement was overshadowed because of Masi’s role. “He was a liability for the sport because everybody kept talking about Abu Dhabi and the race director,” he said. “The race director should not be somebody that people talk about, but someone who does the job and makes sure the race is run according to the regulations.” Wolff also revealed he had appealed to Masi in the week before the race to adopt a more open-handed approach to developing his role. “I had lunch with him on the Wednesday before the race,” he said. “I said to him: ‘I really want to tell you, without patronising you, that you need to take criticism on board and develop from there. Lewis does it every day, but you are a guy who always seems to know better’. It wasn’t about influencing him but really giving my honest feedback that he shouldn’t block outside opinion as simply being wrong.” The crucial moment during the closing laps in Abu Dhabi were marked by both Wolff and the Red Bull team principal, Christian Horner, lobbying on behalf of their teams directly to Masi over the radio. The FIA have since removed their ability to do so with teams only able to contact the race director via an intermediary. Masi was to be moved to another role in the FIA but they have yet to reveal what this position will be. This year Masi was replaced with two new personnel, Eduardo Freitas and Niels Wittich, and the FIA has also introduced a series of new structures, including a standalone race control unit to function similarly to VAR in football. After three races this season Freitas and Wittich have thus far been reasonably strict with their application of the rules but have not made any major interventions. Last week in Australia however Wittich attracted some controversy by reiterating to drivers the rule that they cannot wear piercings or jewellery in the car for safety reasons. Hamilton has already stated he will not be removing some of his, noting that in the case of his ear they were “welded in”. Wolff praised Wittich’s performances thus far but questioned whether the jewellery ban was a rule worthy of backing to a standoff. “How he has run the first few races has been respectful, solid and he hasn’t put a single foot wrong,” he said. “But is that [jewellery ban] a battle he needs to have at this stage? However, if it turns out to be the biggest unfortunate misstep of a race director, I would take it a thousand times over.” Charles Leclerc won in Australia for Ferrari, his second victory in the opening three races, while his current leading title rival Verstappen was forced to retire with a mechanical problem, his second retirement of the season. Leclerc now enjoys a significant lead in the title race. He is 34 points in front of Hamilton’s teammate George Russell in second, 43 in front of Hamilton, with Verstappen 46 points down. The next round is at Imola on 24 April.",Sport/Sport,Toto Wolff says former race director Masi was liability to F1 and disrespectful,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/11/toto-wolff-says-former-race-director-masi-was-liability-to-f1-and-disrespectful
4/12/2022,"Robert Eggers has created the Scandi noir to end all Scandi noirs: an atavistic revenge horror based on the Old Norse legend of Amleth, a young nobleman intent on bloody payback against the uncle who murdered his father and married his widowed mother; it’s the tale that inspired Shakespeare’s play Hamlet. Among its many acts of hysterical violence, this film chops off the first syllable of Hamlet’s indecision; it hacks away the Elizabethan melancholy and existential hesitation that Shakespeare grafted on to his anguished hero, and turns him into a single-minded warrior who is very buff and roars with neck tendons flaring like peacock feathers. He is a loincloth-wearing, wolf’s-head-sporting guy who frankly isn’t that fussed about being or not being … or only in the sense that the former applies to him and the latter to his enemies. This drama very much takes Amleth away from the thespian green room and simplifies the story along Lion King lines (no Hakuna Matata though). Yet it also does away with the imbecility that the original Amleth feigned, which Shakespeare then transformed into an ambiguous ordeal of madness. “Amleth” means “stupid”, but Amleth is not that. Alexander Skarsgård plays Amleth, who as a boy witnessed the murder of his father King Aurvandil, played by Ethan Hawke. The culprits were henchmen in the pay of his saturnine, duplicitous uncle Fjölnir, played by Claes Bang. The murderer then marries Aurvandil’s queen Gudrún, played with a willowy yet steely and gimlet-eyed presence by Nicole Kidman. The first time we see Gudrún is when young Amleth (Oscar Novak) is told off by his mother for scampering into her bedroom while she is dressing: Eggers and co-screenwriter Sjön playfully encourage us to suspect that there will be some time in the future when Amleth will have a nakedly intimate encounter with his mother. So it proves – and Kidman gets an absolute showstopper of a scene. Little Amleth escapes and grows to hunky manhood obsessed with his brutal destiny: the story unfolds in a stark vista of unremitting violence, periodically switching from plangent colour to a kind of bleak monochrome for its various shroomy visions and prophetic confrontations. We have the traditional robust Viking banqueting scene at the very beginning, at which Fjölnir is irritated by Aurvandil’s capering jester Heimir, played by Willem Dafoe, who in death is to get a very disturbing Yorick-skull moment. Björk plays a witchy seer (from Scotland perhaps), taunting Amleth with his fate. Amleth returns from his exile in “the land of Rus” as a slave in the household of Fjölnir, there falling in love with Olga (Anya Taylor-Joy), and his vengeance is not simply a matter of execution; he is to be a lightning-rod for the forces of terrible retribution that boom across the heavens. Along the way, the slaves are permitted some Midsommar-style frolicking, but must participate in a rough game which can only be described as Australian Rules Quidditch. The Northman is a horribly violent, nihilistic and chaotic story about the endless cycle of violence, the choice between loving your friends and hating your enemies – which turns out to be no choice at all, and the thread of fate down which masculinity’s delicious toxin drips. It’s entirely outrageous, with some epic visions of the flaring cosmos. I couldn’t look away.  The Northman is released on 15 April in the UK, 21 April in Australia and 22 April in the US.",Arts/Film,The Northman review – Robert Eggers’ brutal vision of vengeance and violence,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/11/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-hamlet-outrageous-violence
4/12/2022,"Sweden’s ruling party has begun debating whether the country should join Nato, and neighbouring Finland expects to reach a decision within weeks, as Moscow warned that the Nordic nations’ accession would “not bring stability” to Europe. Both countries are officially non-aligned militarily, but public support for Nato membership has almost doubled since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, to about 50% in Sweden and 60% in Finland, multiple opinion polls suggest. Sweden’s centre-left Social Democrats, led by prime minister Magdalena Andersson, said their “security review” was about more than just joining the 30-nation alliance, adding that the party could decide to apply even without the backing of members. Having stressed at the outbreak of the war that non-alignment had “served Sweden’s interests well”, Andersson said she was “ready to discuss” the policy in light of Moscow’s aggression, and in late March said she “did not rule out” joining Nato. “When Russia invaded Ukraine, Sweden’s security position changed fundamentally,” the party said in a statement on Monday. The Social Democrat general secretary, Tobias Baudin, said the security review would be complete “before the summer”. The question is expected to be a key issue in parliamentary elections due on 11 September, with centre-right opposition parties already saying they would back a Nato application and the far-right Sweden Democrats also open to the idea. Finland, which shares a 1,340km (830-mile) border with Russia and, like Sweden, is a Nato partner after abandoning its position of strict neutrality at the end of the cold war, is expected to outline its decision regarding the alliance before midsummer. Alexander Stubb, a former prime minister of Finland, told AFP it was “a foregone conclusion” that Helsinki would apply to join Nato, probably in time for a June Nato summit in Madrid. A government-commissioned national security review is due to be delivered to parliament next week to help Finnish MPs decide on the question before they vote, with one recent poll suggesting only six of the country’s 200 MPs were opposed. “We will have very careful discussions, but not taking any more time than we have to,” the country’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said last week. “I think we will end the discussion before midsummer,” she said. Both countries have received public assurances from the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, that their applications would be welcome, as well as expressions of support from several members including the US, UK, Germany, France and Turkey. But the move would almost certainly be seen as a provocation by the Kremlin, whose spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said on Monday that the alliance was “a tool geared towards confrontation” and that their possible accession “will not bring stability to the European continent”.",News/World news,Sweden and Finland make moves to join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/sweden-and-finland-make-moves-to-join-nato

4/12/2022,"Imran Ahmad Khan liked to be noticed. Wandering around Westminster in a pinstripe suit with a cane, he looked and sounded like a Conservative MP from another era, calling colleagues “old boy” and “dear chap”, despite only being in his 40s – “like a tinpot Churchill”, as one of his colleagues puts it. He was prone to ostentatious displays of wealth, sometimes parking a Rolls-Royce in the parliamentary car park. In his 2019 victory speech he paid special tribute to his mother, whom he called “ma-mah”, like a member of the royal family. He is close to his family, particularly his brothers Karim and Khaled, both lawyers, the former a prosecutor at the international criminal court in The Hague. After becoming Wakefield’s first Conservative MP since 1932, Khan, a keen Brexiter, quickly garnered a reputation as an oddball with a questionable grasp on reality. One Conservative MP recalled an early meeting of the 2019 intake in Downing Street, where the new MPs were being briefed on the Brexit negotiations. “My overriding memory of Imran is him piping up: is there no chance we could threaten to close the straits of Denmark [which connect the Baltic Sea to the North Sea] as a negotiating position? The Spad there wrote it down and made a note to never trust this man with anything ever again,” the MP said. Khan had an exhibitionist streak, responding to a criticism that he had been “parachuted” into Wakefield as a last-minute candidate for the 2019 general election by jumping out of a plane and parachuting into the West Yorkshire city for a public appearance. Though friends knew he was gay, he tried to keep his sexuality a secret. Shortly after his election win he forced a correction from the Conservative LGBT+ group for saying he was the first openly gay Muslim to be elected in the UK. “We are incorrect to describe him as an ‘out’ LGBT candidate,” the group wrote, explaining that an “application was made in his name to the LGBT+ Conservatives candidates’ fund”, but Ahmad Khan insisted the application had been made in error. He admitted only during his trial that he was in fact gay. Born in Wakefield to a doctor and nurse at the local hospital, he was not the Tories’ first choice to contest the seat. He got the call only when the original candidate had to withdraw a month before polling day after journalists dredged up his offensive Facebook history. Corners may well have been cut in the vetting process as a result. The main complainant in his sexual assault trial testified he had tried to warn the Conservatives about Khan before his election, saying the prospective MP had abused him when he was 15. The complainant says he was not taken seriously and so went to the police instead. But delays in the investigation meant Khan was able to win his parliamentary seat with a 3,358 majority and serve 18 months before he was eventually charged, prompting his suspension from the Conservative party.",News/Politics,Imran Ahmad Khan: Tory MP in sexual assault case had oddball reputation,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/11/imran-ahmad-khan-tory-mp-in-sexual-assault-case-had-oddball-reputation
4/12/2022,"At an upscale restaurant in Moscow, the bubbly was flowing as guests in cocktail dresses and expensive suits danced the night away. They had gathered on Sunday for the 70th birthday of Steven Seagal, the American-born actor best known for playing hard-bitten cops and commandos in action movies. “Each and every one of you, you are my family and my friends. And I love all of you,” Seagal toasted, wearing his signature oversized black shirt. “We stand together, through thick and through thin,” he added. Sitting at the table next to Seagal were some of Russia’s leading Kremlin supporters, including the editor-in-chief of the state-controlled news network RT, Margarita Simonyan, and Vladimir Soloviev, one of the country’s most notorious propagandists, who was translating Seagal’s speech into Russian. The actor, a self-described Buddhist, has long had a close relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and was granted Russian citizenship in 2016. He previously called Putin’s annexation of Crimea “very reasonable” and described the president as “one of the world’s greatest living leaders”. Since the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, he has doubled down on his support for Putin, saying in a recent interview that an “outside entity” was at fault for pitting the two countries against each other. The Kremlin and state-controlled media have for decades cultivated Putin’s friendship with western celebrities, such as Seagal, in what many saw as an effort to boost his image at home and abroad. “The main goal of all of this was to demonstrate that the country’s model of society is appealing to outsiders,” said Mark Galeotti, the author of We Need to Talk About Putin and a senior associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute. However, the number of western stars and politicians who, like Seagal, are still willing to go “through thick and thin” with Putin has quickly dwindled over the past month, with many eager to distance themselves from a country that is accused of committing war crimes during the invasion. One of the first among Putin’s friends to condemn Russia’s actions was the French superstar Gérard Depardieu, who denounced “the crazy, unacceptable excesses of their leaders like Vladimir Putin” in Ukraine. Depardieu, who has won global acclaim for his roles in films such as The Last Metro and Jean de Florette, became a Russian citizen in 2013, after criticising the French government over its tax policies. In a letter to Russian state television at the time, Depardieu exclaimed: “I love your president, Vladimir Putin, very much and it’s mutual.” Putin personally awarded Russian citizenship to Depardieu that year at a special dinner where the two were pictured hugging. However, speaking to Agence France-Presse in March, Depardieu, who is currently facing rape charges in France, called on Russia to “stop the weapons and negotiate”. Depardieu’s comments were met with anger in Russia, with Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, saying the actor “did not completely understand” the situation in Ukraine. Some Russian officials have called on Putin to cancel Depardieu’s Russian citizenship. Criticism of Russia’s actions has only increased after news reports emerged showing the bodies of men in civilian clothes lying in the streets of Bucha, outside Kyiv, a testament to the full scale of the atrocities that Russian forces are believed to have committed in Ukraine. On Saturday, the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi admitted that he was “deeply disappointed and saddened” by the behaviour of the Russian leader. Berlusconi, thought to be an admirer of Putin’s macho style of governing, famously visited a Crimean vineyard with the Russian leader shortly after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. The billionaire has now said Russia was responsible for “the horror of the massacres of civilians in Bucha and other places, real war crimes”. Putin has also been criticised by the so-called western anti-establishment camp – journalists and celebrities who have previously expressed support for Russia in their mutual criticism of “American imperialism”. Shortly after Russia launched its attack on Ukraine, the veteran US film director Oliver Stone, who has defended Russia’s actions in Crimea in his documentaries and in 2017 conducted a series of interviews with the Russian leader, tweeted that Putin’s “aggression in Ukraine” was a “mistake”. “Although the United States has many wars of aggression on its conscience, it doesn’t justify Mr Putin’s aggression in Ukraine. A dozen wrongs don’t make a right. Russia was wrong to invade.” While Galeotti argued that Putin probably “never put much trust in foreign friends” in the first place, he said the latest criticism by once pro-Kremlin figures ultimately points to the growing isolation in which Russia has found itself. “When a would-be great power’s only real friends seem to be Syria, Venezuela and Nicaragua, you have to ask what has gone wrong.”",News/World news,Support for Putin among western celebrities drains away over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/11/vladimir-putin-celebrities-ukraine-invasion-steven-seagal-gerard-depardieu
4/12/2022,"The England captain, Leah Williamson, has described Northern Ireland as a “serious contender” ahead of the Lionesses’ World Cup qualifier at Windsor Park on Tuesday evening. Williamson is the only confirmed change to England’s starting lineup having sat out the 10-0 victory against North Macedonia in Skopje on Friday as a result of precautionary concussion protocol. “I thought the girls were great, very professional, we had a job to do, we wanted to create lots of chances and prove to be a clinical team and the girls did that,” Williamson said. “It’s never nice to sit out a football match but when the girls play like that it’s fairly easy.” Should England beat Northern Ireland and Austria drop points against Latvia, also on Tuesday evening, then the Lionesses’ qualification for the 2023 World Cup would be confirmed with two games left to play. For Northern Ireland, who meet England in Group A at the European Championship this summer, a win would keep alive their hopes of a playoff spot – they sit third in the group, three points behind Austria. In October, in front of 23,225 fans at Wembley, England beat Northern Ireland 4-0 with a second-half hat-trick from the Arsenal forward Beth Mead and a 72nd-minute strike from Chelsea’s Beth England. On paper, beating a team ranked 38 places below them in the world rankings should prove a straightforward task for England but Northern Ireland, managed by Kenny Shiels, are a rapidly evolving team and Williamson is refusing to take them lightly. “It was a competitive and difficult game last time, especially in the first half,” she said. “Yes, we’ve had some games we’ve won comfortably [in this qualifying campaign] but I don’t expect it to be comfortable on Tuesday – Northern Ireland are proving with each game that comes that they’re a serious contender. “That’s the beauty of qualification. There’s something to play for and you don’t get much more of a challenge than that.” For the Arsenal defender, the occasion will be extra special as it will be the first time she leads England out since the manager, Sarina Wiegman, named her as her captain for the home European Championship this summer. “The main thing is it’s obviously a very proud moment,” Williamson said. “The biggest honour in football. I appreciate that and I’m aware of the responsibility that comes with that title, especially in England. “My family are obviously very happy for me. For us it’s something we do every day, it’s our job but for them it’s something for them to enjoy and maybe after all these years of following me around and watching me, to watch me then do it on the biggest stage, with that responsibility, is really proud for them.” Williamson is also no stranger to feeling the heat in Belfast. On 9 April 2015, two weeks after her 18th birthday, the then under-19s captain was forced to take a truly bizarre penalty in the city against Norway. It was a replay of a penalty she had taken against the same opponent in a European Championship qualifier five days earlier and which she converted only for it to be ruled out by the referee Marija Kurtes for encroachment. The German official subsequently awarded Norway a free-kick when he should have ordered the penalty to be retaken – Uefa intervened and decided it would indeed be retaken, in isolation, in Belfast. Williamson again converted, securing a 2-2 draw for England and, in the process, sealing their place at the European Championship finals. Northern Ireland (4-4-2) Burns; Vance, Robson, Nelson Magee; Holloway, McCarron, Furness, Callaghan; Wade, Magill.

Referee Riem Hussein (Ger). “It turned out well in the end but what I went through that week I wouldn’t wish on anybody,” Williamson said. “I remember I told my mum I would keep it quiet in case I missed and nobody would ever know, and then you lot turned up with your Sky Sports cameras. There’s a couple of the girls here that were in that squad and we were reminiscing about it the other day. It’s a good memory because it turned out well, but it could have gone very differently.” Looking ahead to the World Cup qualifier against Northern Ireland, as well as beyond, Wiegman said: “As we approach every game we are looking to develop our style of play, we want to play well, we want to play good as a team and tomorrow we want to create lots of chances and concede no goals. “It’s going to be a tough game, it’s going to be a great crowd, a big occasion, so I’m really looking forward to that, For them, it’s possibly the last chance they have to win to be able to qualify and we want to win and get as close as possible to qualifying.”",Sport/Football,England Women’s captain Williamson wary of threat from Northern Ireland,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/11/england-womens-captain-williamson-wary-of-threat-from-northern-ireland

You saw the phrase “the Coffee Stirrer” and thought of a teaspoon. And now you’re imagining an impractically large teaspoon. That’s exactly what happened, yes. So what coffee stirrer are you talking about? It’s New York’s newest skyscraper, which is now ready for habitation. It’s officially called the Steinway Tower, but local people refer to it as the Coffee Stirrer, because it is very tall and very skinny. How tall and how skinny? A quarter of a mile tall and 18.3 metres (60ft) wide, giving it a height-to-width ratio of 24:1. It’s dubbed the world’s skinniest skyscraper. I’m having trouble picturing that. The building’s width is exactly the length of a standard bowling alley. That’s so skinny it’s stupid. At least the apartments inside will be priced cheaply to reflect that. Well, about that. Oh, here we go … The most expensive apartment in the tower is on the market for an eye-watering £50.7m. Good lord. If it helps, you can pick up the cheapest one for just £6m.
