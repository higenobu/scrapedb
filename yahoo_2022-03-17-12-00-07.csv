3/17/2022,"A lawsuit has been settled over the mass arrest of 64 partygoers on marijuana charges. Driving the news: The defendants — the Cartersville Police Department, Bartow County Sheriff’s Office and the Bartow-Cartersville Drug Task Force — will pay $900,000 as part of the settlement, the Southern Center for Human Rights said in a news release. Get market news worthy of your time with Axios Markets. Subscribe for free. The lawsuit was filed by the Southern Center and Marietta-based Merchant Law Firm. Why it matters: It’s not possible for all 64 people to possess that same amount of marijuana, says Gerald Griggs, an attorney and past vice president of the Georgia NAACP, which organized a campaign to get the charges dropped. “I always thought it was a civil rights violation and that the young people’s rights needed to be protected,” he tells Axios Catch up quick: Cartersville officers were dispatched on New Year’s Eve in 2017 to a home after getting reports of gunshots. Officers said they smelled marijuana and entered the house without consent or a warrant, the Southern Center says. Dozens of people ranging in age from 15 to 30, the majority of whom were Black and other people of color, were attending a birthday party at the home. Police, who found less than an ounce of marijuana in the home, arrested the partygoers. The Drug Task Force initially said they found evidence of widespread drug use and that the 64 people were charged with possession of marijuana less than an ounce, a misdemeanor, because it was within “everyone’s reach or control.” Representatives from the city of Cartersville did not respond to Axios’ requests for comment. Nearly two weeks later after the arrests, the Bartow County district attorney dropped the charges, saying that the evidence was “insufficient to convict” the 64 defendants. What they’re saying: Ebony Brown, an attorney with the Southern Center for Human Rights, said officers immediately treated everyone at the party like suspects. “This type of guilt-by-association policing is ripe for the abuses you see here, and the real-world consequences for people like our plaintiffs are devastating,” she said. Despite the settlement, the Southern Center says the city of Cartersville has not amended its policy that allows officers to enter homes when they smell what they think is marijuana. John Merchant of The Merchant Law Firm says in a news release that officers had plenty of time to investigate the circumstances before raiding the home and arresting his clients “simply for being present at the party.” “We are happy we were able to resolve the case, and we remain hopeful that these agencies will make the necessary changes to ensure this does not happen again,” he said.

3/17/2022,"DALLAS (AP) — The airline industry is escalating its campaign against a California law that gives pilots and flight attendants who are based there more rest and meal breaks than they are guaranteed under federal regulations. A study commissioned by an airline trade group and released Tuesday warns that the result will be higher costs that would force carriers to cut flights and raise fares. The trade group wants the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down a 2021 appeals court ruling which held that California-based flight crews are covered by the state's requirement that workers be free from all job duties for 10 minutes every four hours and for a 30-minute meal break every five hours, even during flights. The ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco came in a lawsuit filed by flight attendants for California-based Virgin America, which was bought by Alaska Airlines in 2016 and no longer exists. The dispute boils down to a question of who gets to write labor regulations covering airline workers. The Federal Aviation Administration sets safety standards for airlines, including minimum rest requirements for pilots and flight attendants to guard against fatigue that could lead to accidents. The industry argues that since deregulation in 1978, FAA's authority has pre-empted states' efforts to oversee airlines. Airline officials are terrified by the prospect of facing a patchwork of state rules that they say would add complexity and cost to their operations. Officials of the trade group Airlines for America said this week that 19 other states have rules on employee breaks and could apply them to flight crews unless the Supreme Court overturns the ruling against Virgin America. Lawyers for the flight attendants who sued Virgin America say the 1978 deregulation law gave the federal government sole authority over airline prices, routes and services but not other regulations affecting airlines. They say the appeals court ruled properly and there is no reason for the Supreme Court to review the matter. Airlines already follow the California rest-break requirements for ground workers such as bag handlers and gate agents, according to the trade group officials. The Biden administration's solicitor general has not taken a position on whether the Supreme Court should hear the case. The airline trade group's release of a report warning of dire consequences appears designed to put pressure on the administration to take the industry's side before the high court. The study by Canadian consulting firm InterVistas estimates that airlines would need additional pilots and flight attendants to comply with the California law. They might also make more frequent stops on flights using California-based flight crews. Depending on the approach, the changes would cost the industry between $3.5 billion and $8.5 billion a year, according to the consultant. A more likely response — closing employee bases in California so that no airline flight crews are based there — would be much cheaper. However, that would require out-of-state flight attendants and pilots to commute to and from their flights, and it could introduce more uncertainty to staffing flights in Los Angeles, San Francisco and other California cities. The nation’s largest union of flight attendants said crew rest was just one issue on which airlines are fighting against their employees. “Management claims they couldn’t possibly keep up with state laws, but at every turn from Washington to California to New York and Illinois they’re working overtime to deny aviation workers adequate nutrition, rest, and sick leave,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants. Current FAA rules set a maximum work day of 14 hours for flight attendants, after which they need at least nine hours off before their next shift. The FAA has proposed adding an hour of rest between shifts without shortening the 14-hour duty period. Flight crews can take meal breaks, but — contrary to the California law — they must remain on duty. The Supreme Court case is Virgin America Inc. v.

3/17/2022,"The unsettled weather pattern that has been impacting the Northwest this week is set to continue. Another large storm is forecast to take aim at the region this weekend, just in time to put a damper on the official start of spring, AccuWeather forecasters say. Rain persisted across the Northwest Tuesday, particularly along the Interstate 5 corridor, with the heaviest rain causing localized flooding Tuesday night. With freezing levels fairly high, between 4,000 and 6,000 feet, there was some disruption over the passes. After a short lull, the bigger event is expected to arrive this weekend and is expected to feature cold air, high winds, rain and snow for higher elevations. ""The first day of spring may start on Sunday, but Mother Nature has other plans for the West Coast,"" said AccuWeather Meteorologist Alex DaSilva, explaining that a powerful storm is expected to move into the Northwest Friday night. Steady rain could even arrive as early as late Friday afternoon in western Washington and Oregon, and high temperatures could drop into the lower and middle 50s Saturday. ""The storm will bring a chilly air mass with it and will allow for snow levels to drop below pass level in the Cascades,"" DaSilva said. This satellite image shows storms tracking across the Pacific and toward North America as of early Tuesday, March 15, 2022 (NOAA GOES-WEST) ""Snow levels Saturday will be between 3,000 and 4,000 feet [in elevation] and by Saturday night they could drop below 2,000 feet in some areas,"" added DaSilva, who noted that snow is likely to make travel difficult Saturday and Saturday night in the Cascade passes. Rain and showers could stretch from Central California to the Canadian border Saturday, with snow in the mountains. The heaviest rain is forecast to fall from Oregon to Central California with some localized flooding, as well as some snow, in Donner Pass. With the steady rain, the Skokomish River near Potlatch, Washington, is yet again forecast to rise into minor flood stage Saturday. Seattle is another location where the rain could cause problems, as the city is currently at 124% of average rainfall so far this year. ""By Sunday the storm will dive south into the Southwest, bringing mountain snow to the Sierra Nevada and rain to coastal areas,"" DaSilva said. Rain and gusty winds are expected to extend to Southern California as well as parts of Arizona, Utah and Colorado. Temperatures will tumble about 5-10 degrees Fahrenheit below average across the Southwest oSunday and Monday, according to DaSilva. The highs Saturday and Sunday in Los Angeles will drop several degrees from Friday when temperatures could reach around 80 F. By Sunday afternoon, temperatures will struggle to reach 70. Phoenix could have temperatures in the upper 60s Sunday afternoon, well below the average in the upper 70s for mid-March. ""While any rain will be welcome across the drought-stricken Southwest, this storm won't bring nearly enough precipitation to put a dent in the drought,"" said DaSilva. Over a quarter of the West is in extreme drought, particularly in Nevada with 36% of the state experiencing these conditions, according to the United States Drought Monitor. Since the beginning of the year, Reno, Nevada, has received just 17% of its average precipitation. California is another state that could desperately use some rain as over 80% of the state is in severe drought. Fresno has had under a quarter of an inch of precipitation since the start of January, a dismal 4% of average. San Francisco reported 7% of its average precipitation since the city rang in the new year. DaSilva also said that he's more concerned with the gusty winds associated with this storm, especially considering the ongoing drought. ""The storm will bring strong winds to the Southwest on Sunday which can lead to an elevated fire risk,"" he said. The combination of dry, drought-ridden vegetation and gusty, fire-fanning winds can be incredibly dangerous when it comes to wildfire development. Experts say residents should not throw cigarettes out of moving vehicles and be sure to extinguish outdoor fires properly. ""It is important this time of year for many areas across the Southwest to get rainfall, as the late spring and summer months are typically very dry across the region,"" said DaSilva. After impacting the West, this storm is expected to move into the Rocky Mountains and Plains by early next week, bringing snow to the Front Range and northern Plains and even some severe weather in the southern Plains.

3/17/2022,"On March 15, 1992, my sister was taken from this world after 21 years, 4 months and 6 days of living on it. I write this essay to give my late sister, Elizabeth Helen Foster, a voice in the best way I know how. For many years, I really tried to forget most of what happened since that dreadful day the authorities found her body in a shallow grave along U.S. 441 in Gainesville. However, the memories come rushing back to me like they were yesterday. Her body was beaten and bruised after being sexually assaulted, with the final blow shattering the front of her skull and rendering her unconscious. She was dumped like trash into a shallow grave just big enough to fit her tiny 5’2”, 115-pound frame while she was still breathing. The soil around the area was gray almost like ash with heavy vegetation and growth all around, giving off a sweet smell as if nothing horrifying had ever occurred there. I was 13 years old when I visited this site with my parents shortly after my sister’s body was located. I remember the air was humid and the sky was sunny and pleasant as any typical Florida afternoon in March. I could hear the sounds of birds chirping and children laughing and playing in the distance. It was surreal for what we laid witness to that day. Multiple failures throughout the course of time, caused by human error and possibly a lack of real empathy, brought my sister to that moment. My sister’s killer was a serial killer. In 1972, he was arrested and convicted of murdering a Miami woman, Linda Fida, a former beauty pageant contestant. She was sexually assaulted, choked to death and stabbed multiple times until the blade bent and could not be used anymore. Her lifeless corpse was then plunged into her own bathtub full of water to be drowned, because her killer was not convinced she was actually dead. Her killer confessed without remorse and was dubbed a sociopath. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. It was known he would kill again if ever let out of prison. However, a life prison sentence in Florida in the 1970s and 1980s was not for life. This killer only served 13 years and was released from prison by the parole board, while prisoners sentenced for non-violent drug offenses sat in prison for double the length of time. In 1989, Tiffany Sessions, a University of Florida student, disappeared. She looked oddly similar to my sister. Her family was of the highest ilk with the likes of celebrities such as Dan Marino to help them raise funds and resources to try and locate Sessions. Her disappearance and death would remain unsolved for much longer than anyone expected. In the late 1990s, my parents agreed to exhume my sister’s body to collect additional DNA evidence to find her killer. Yet, this DNA remained shelved for many more years. In 2009, three years after my father’s passing and my mother’s trauma reaching its apex, my mother and I called a meeting with the authorities. A young woman detective, a forensic analyst, gave us personal assurances that she would push certain pieces of evidence through the extensively backlogged FBI crime lab.  In 2012, an oral swab from my sister’s remains was finally tested. It wasn't from the guy they had been convincing my parents for the better part of two decades had killed my sister, but an inmate in prison for a different crime of kidnapping, sexual assault and attempting to kill a 15-year-old minor in Clearwater. He was Linda Fida's killer, in a prison less than 40 miles from my residence. He was suffering from Stage 4 lung cancer and did not have much time to live. Following his death, the authorities discovered his diary with numerous entries possibly identifying five to seven or more female souls he took from this earth — one being entry No. 2, Tiffany Sessions, with her date of death demarcated in the entry. My sister, Elizabeth Foster, was a hero even after death because through the oral DNA swab, the police were able to identify the perpetrator of Sessions’ murder. My sister was not the daughter of wealth or a former beauty pageant contestant. She was the girl who loved to laugh with her friends and cared deeply about others. She was the big sister who would make fun of her annoying little brother, but at the same time would invite him to occasionally sit in her room with her and listen to records or ask if she looked nice in an outfit. She was the girl that loved to take random photos and would come home from college on break with new pets to the surprise of my parents. She was the girl who loved big and was extremely naïve to a lot of the troubles and dangers of the world. I can’t blame my parents for letting her go so far away to college as they did their best, but they were kind of naïve too. Being the father of daughters, I can’t be naïve and stick my head in the ground. I have to share my sister’s story and the souls that we lost too soon because we as a society failed them. I end with this quote from Eleanor Roosevelt: “Learn from the mistakes of others. You can't live long enough to make them all yourself.” Love you, Betsy. Your little brother. Richard A.
