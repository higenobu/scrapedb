2/16/2022,"Today in a nutshell: The US men’s team make an unexpected ice hockey exit but American skiers claim a men’s slopestyle 1-2 as Norway continue to dominate the medals Next up: There is freestyle skiing, ice hockey, curling and short track speed skating still to come today. Tomorrow: the finale of the Kamila Valieva show  A pair of Americans topped the men’s freeski slopestyle podium after Alex Hall soared to Olympic gold ahead of teammate Nick Goepper, who took the silver. Sweden’s Jesper Tjäder won the bronze ahead of Andri Ragettli, the defending world champion from Switzerland. “It definitely was the best slopestyle run I’ve ever done, mainly because it embodied everything I love about skiing and how I approach skiing and I didn’t fade away from that to try and maybe get bigger scores or something,” Hall said. Clement Noel of France came from sixth place to take men’s slalom gold with an absolutely blistering second run. Austria’s Johannes Strolz won silver to go with his gold in the combined, finishing 0.61 seconds behind Noel, while reigning world champion Sebastian Foss-Solevaag of Norway took bronze. “It’s not often that you are able to win a medal in the Olympic Games. It’s one shot – one minute and 40 seconds every four years,” Noel said. Dave Ryding’s dream of an Olympic medal of Great Britain faded away after a mistake on his opening run cost him any chance of a podium finish. “I am always realistic and while I would love to say I’ll be back, I probably won’t be. But I’ll for sure take it year by year from now,” the 35-year-old said. There was an upset in the men’s ice hockey quarter-finals. Slovakia gambled while 2-1 down to the USA by taking off their goaltender and throwing on an extra attacker, grabbed an equaliser with 43 seconds remaining, then won the dramatic shootout that followed to eliminate the tournament’s unbeaten top seeds. “This one’s going to sting for a little bit,” veteran US defenseman Steven Kampfer said. “I thought we were the better team for a majority of the game. You come up a little bit short.” The latest set of round robin matches in the women’s curling has seen Switzerland become the first country to book their semi-final berth. However a surprise defeat by China leaves Great Britain’s women with one match to go which they must win, and that still might not be enough if other results don’t go their way. It was a much happier story for Team GB’s men. Victory over ROC means they will feature in the semi-finals alongside Sweden and Canada. The final spot in the men’s last four will go to the US if they can beat Denmark in tomorrow’s morning session. Elvira Öberg anchored Sweden’s team to gold in the women’s 4 x 6km biathlon relay, skiing fast and shooting clean to win her third medal of the Games. The athletes of the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) were second, Germany third. In cross-country skiing, Erik Valnes and Johannes Høsflot Klæbo took gold – Norway’s 13th gold of the Games, continuing their recent dominance of the medal table. After the short program of the women’s single skating competition yesterday, Kamila Valieva leads with a score of 82.16, just under two points clear of her Russian compatriot, the world champion Anna Shcherbakova. Jarl Magnus Riiber of Norway spent two weeks in Covid isolation, was let out on Monday, jumped into the lead in the Nordic combined on Tuesday with a phenomenal 142m leap, then took a wrong turn on the cross-country leg, blowing his 44-second advantage and finishing eighth. “It’s a silly mistake,” Riiber said afterwards. “It’s not fun to show the world that I maybe wasted a gold medal”. Riiber’s compatriot Joergen Graabak took the gold in the end. Mikaela Shiffrin was fastest in a downhill training session ahead of Thursday’s Alpine combined race. It’s a welcome bit of cheer for an athlete who has had a torrid time in Beijing after arriving at these Games on a wave of expectation. Germany had the first podium sweep in Beijing with all the medals going to Germany in the two-man bobsleigh. Francesco Friedrich and Thorsten Margis were the winning pairing.

2/16/2022,"Tigrayan soldiers killed civilians and gang-raped women and girls in Ethiopia’s northern Amhara region, a human rights organisation has claimed, in the latest accusation of atrocities made against fighters engaged in the country’s civil war. Troops with the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) shot dead at least 24 people in the town of Kobo in one day last September, according to Amnesty International.  The organisation also accused Tigrayan forces of raping and sexually assaulting at least 30 women and girls as young as 14 in and around Chenna, a village north of the Amhara regional capital, Bahir Dar. Most of the alleged atrocities took place in late August and September last year, the organisation said, when the TPLF was in control of parts of Amhara as it made gains against troops loyal to the Ethiopian federal government. “Evidence is mounting of a pattern of Tigrayan forces committing war crimes and possible crimes against humanity in areas under their control in the Amhara region. This includes repeated incidents of widespread rape, summary killings and looting,” said Sarah Jackson, Amnesty International’s deputy director for east Africa. “The TPLF leadership must put an immediate end to the atrocities we have documented and remove from its forces anyone suspected of involvement in such crimes.” Amnesty said it had approached the TPLF with the allegations, but had received no reply. The TPLF has previously denied allegations of killings and rape by its troops. In phone interviews with 27 people, described by Amnesty as witnesses and survivors of the killings in Kobo, the organisation said it had been told that on 9 September, TPLF fighters summarily shot unarmed civilians, “seemingly in revenge for losses among their ranks at the hands of Amhara militias and armed farmers”. One person quoted in the report described seeing the bloody aftermath of the killings the following day. “The first dead bodies we saw were by the school fence,” he is quoted as saying. “There were 20 bodies lying in their underwear and facing the fence and three more bodies in the school compound. Most were shot at the back of their heads and some in the back. Those who were shot at the back of their heads could not be recognised because their faces were partially blown off.” The report, released on Wednesday, also contains allegations of 30 cases of rape and other sexual violence against ethnic Amhara women and girls. Fourteen of those interviewed by Amnesty in and around Chenna said they had been raped by multiple perpetrators, two in front of their children. Seven were under 18, the report noted, and 10 remained hospitalised three months later. The cases were not isolated, said the report. “Rather, they seem to be part of a pattern of similar violations repeatedly perpetrated by large numbers of Tigrayan fighters in different locations,” it said. “Moreover, such abuses are likely underreported due to stigma within the survivors’ communities, challenges in accessing the locations, and communication blackouts that restrict and delay the flow of information.” Raging since November 2020, the conflict in northern Ethiopia has been marked by possible widespread human rights abuses on all sides, according to a joint investigation by the UN and the country’s human rights commission, which released its findings late last year. According to Amnesty, the majority of violations documented to date have been committed by Ethiopian and Eritrean government forces and associated militias against Tigrayan civilians, mostly in the Tigray region. Last week, lawyers acting for Tigrayan civilians in a complaint filed to the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights said that, while reports suggested abuses had been committed by different parties, Tigrayan civilians constituted “the overwhelming majority of victims”.",News/Global development,Tigrayan soldiers accused of raping and killing civilians in Ethiopia’s civil war,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/16/tigrayan-soldiers-accused-of-raping-and-killing-civilians-in-ethiopias-civil-war
2/16/2022,"Partygate has suggested that the prime minister has, shall we say, a flexible approach to the rule of law. The laws of physics, you would think, cannot be treated so carelessly – yet that is what is happening inside the Conservative party. There has been a relentless push by some MPs for the UK to abandon our climate targets and slow down, or even abandon, the transition to net zero emissions. The goal of net zero by 2050 at the latest is not some fashionable green meme or virtue signalling by the comfortable middle classes. It is the measure we must take to keep the already painful and life-threatening impacts of climate change within the bounds of the manageable. This goal is shared not just by scientists and environmental campaigners but by 192 governments, more than 90 major banks and all of the world’s major investment managers.  Action on climate change is one of the few remaining areas where Britain has a credible claim to global leadership. Only three months ago, we were hosting the UN climate summit, Cop26, the most important international gathering in the UK for decades. We have set the pace in decarbonising our own economy and creating the global governance system to manage the response to the climate crisis. We have done so because it is in our national interest, as successive governments, Labour and Conservative, have recognised. We cannot ask other countries to aim for net zero if we abandon our commitment to it ourselves. Yet that is just what the tiny group of Conservative MPs in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group are trying to make us do, in the latest salvo of their eccentric opposition to sound science. Led by Steve Baker and Craig Mackinlay and some of their faithful cheerleaders in the rightwing press, they are demanding the prime minister abandons the green levies that help finance Britain’s drive to net zero, out of apparent concern over soaring energy bills. They are right to be worried about the impact of energy price rises on everyone in Britain, especially low-income households. The welfare of millions of people is at risk, potentially threatening social cohesion. But their crocodile tears about the impact on the least well-off would be more credible if their party’s action hadn’t contributed to the state we’re in, because the Conservative government’s decision to “get rid of all the green crap” a decade ago means that the UK’s energy bills are £2.5bn higher than they would otherwise have been. Meanwhile, the Cameron government’s cut to energy-efficiency subsidies has had a dramatic effect on the programme to insulate Britain’s notoriously draughty housing stock. In 2012, over 1.5m homes in Britain had their lofts insulated, cutting energy bills and providing a large number of jobs all over the country. Last year, only 32,000 lofts were insulated. Scrapping the zero carbon homes standard, as the Conservatives did in 2015, has led to more than a million new homes being built to lower energy efficiency than they would otherwise have had, resulting in higher bills for those living in them. There is something deeply confused about the Baker-Mackinlay attack on green levies as a burden on poorer people, when those levies have played a significant part in keeping energy bills down. Wind and solar generators in the last quarter of 2021, far from being a charge on bills, actually contributed £160m to lowering them. Furthermore, the MPs’ supposed concern for the least well-off in society didn’t stop them voting this month for a new “green” levy to finance nuclear power stations that will put bills up. In any case, as has frequently been pointed out by energy experts, global gas prices are overwhelmingly responsible for the spike in energy bills, not green levies. Baker and Mackinlay and their ilk are paying more attention to energy lobbyists than the markets. Why else would they be arguing for more fracking or further North Sea gas investment, supposedly to drive bills down, when they know that any gas produced would sell at today’s global gas prices and simply feed windfall profits? But there is a growing risk that in his efforts to keep his job the prime minister will be tempted to add green levies or Britain’s climate targets to the “red meat” being thrown to the Baker-Mackinlay groupuscule, to the concern of climate diplomats such as the architect of the Paris agreement, Laurence Tubiana. The government would do better to take its ideological foot out of its mouth and keep its manifesto promise to spend £9bn of public money on the energy efficiency that would actually help consumers as well as the planet.

2/16/2022,"Named after the central French town of the same name (which, confusingly, also claims a much older almond cake, the pithiviers fondant, as its own), the pithivier is a free-standing puff pastry pie so magnificent that it’s as much centrepiece as dinner. The traditional example, which is not dissimilar to the frangipane-filled galette des rois made to celebrate Epiphany, has a sweet almond centre, though these days a pithivier is just as likely to be savoury. Indeed, though charcutier Nicolas Verot tells me that “what makes the big difference between a pithivier and a pie [tourte] is that a pithivier contains unchopped meat [or vegetables], unlike a tourte”, though in reality, it seems, anything goes. Pierre Koffman does a pheasant one, Rosie Birkett a version filled with cauliflower cheese, Parisian patissier and celebrity chef Cyril Lignac adds truffle to his pork and cheese number … the list goes on. In fact, the internet is full of recipes for pithiviers stuffed with fish, fruit, and even tofu and mushrooms – chopped and otherwise.  Difficult as it was to narrow it down, I’ve decided to focus on a cheese-and-potato filling, for the sole reason that a pithivier is, in Bake Off parlance, a true showstopper, and in my experience nothing stops shows as well as molten cheese. The advice on the pastry and construction, however, applies whatever you put inside. I’m starting with the pastry because, really, this is what defines the pithivier – without puff pastry, it’s just a pie. It is undeniably more faff than shortcrust to make, but after following the instructions in Calum Franklin’s book The Pie Room, I’m reminded that the time-consuming aspect of the process is waiting for the pastry to chill between rolls and folds, rather than that much active work. I would therefore commend this to you as an opportunity to make your own, not least because I struggled to find butter puff pastry in my local shops, and the non-butter kind available commercially often contains palm oil. Feel free to use whatever you prefer, but do consider having a go for a special occasion (and when else would you make a pithivier?). I haven’t put a recipe below, because, frankly, I couldn’t improve on Franklin’s. Homemade or not, it’s important that the pastry and the filling are well chilled before you start construction, and I’d recommend rolling it out a bit thinner than the 2-3cm called for by Mark Hix in the Independent (though I suspect that this has to be a typo, so I don’t even try it). I do try a clever, one-sheet version by Caro Blackwell on the Taste of Savoie blog, which involves cutting out pastry like a tulip, then bringing the petals together on top to seal, but I’m too clumsy and end up with a cheese Vesuvius. If you are similarly afflicted, I’d stick with the standard two-sheet method below, instead, welded together with egg wash. Much safer. I would not advise adding raw potatoes, however thinly sliced, to a pie, as the Waitrose website suggests; even simmered in stock for two minutes, as Hix recommends, they’re rather crunchy for my testers’ tastes. Much as I love potatoes, they are much better soft. Franklin goes as far as to make a dauphinoise, simmering the spuds in milk and cream, then baking them in a slab before putting them in his pie, which is, of course, extremely popular, but, given that you’ve probably already been busy making pastry, I’m going to keep things simpler with slices of cooked potato, as in Blackwell’s recipe. Australian food writer Phoebe Wood deserves a special mention for filling her pie with crushed potato. I love mash with a pie, especially when gravy is involved, but we agree that in a pie, we prefer something with a bit more structural integrity, especially because the cheese layer above it should, in a pithivier, be liquid. I use lactic lancashire in Hix’s recipe, the results of which remind me pleasurably of our own cheese-and-onion pies, and tangy, mature cheddar in Franklin’s; the Waitrose version demands nutty gruyere and Wood salty crumbled feta. All, of course, are very tasty – potatoes and cheese always make a handsome couple – with the feta in particular adding a refreshingly light, summery note, but I’m after a cheese that will melt almost like a gravy, which makes Blackwell’s Alpine reblochon the obvious candidate. Reblochon is not the easiest cheese to get hold of and, good as it tastes, its chief attraction is the obliging way it behaves when heated, so also bear in mind camembert, baron bigod, wigmore, vacherin mont d’or, tunworth and brie, all of which should work well, as will most other soft rinded cheeses. That said, if you prefer, substitute roughly 150g grated hard cheese, instead. You could leave it at potatoes and cheese, frankly, but you may wish to add a vegetable, too, to make the filling a bit less dense – Franklin adds a layer of caramelised onions, Hix and Blackwell use raw onions, and Waitrose goes for garlic. I’ve chosen Wood’s sauteed leeks, because I like their sweetness with cheese and also because the likes of a pithivier should delight the eye as well as the tastebuds, and they add a happy flash of green to proceedings. You could also opt for a layer of butternut squash, as Waitrose suggests, if you’d like to make it really colourful, or Barney Desmazery’s celeriac – or, indeed, any vegetable you like, though, as ever with pastry, I’d strongly counsel ridding it of as much water as possible before letting it anywhere near the puff. Because of the nature of the cheese I’m using, I don’t think the potatoes need the creamy sauce that some recipes include, but I will be adding some bacon lardons, as in Blackwell’s almost tartiflette-like filling, because their savoury flavour works so well with the other ingredients. If you’d prefer to keep your pithivier meat-free, however, rest assured that you will not be missing out by omitting them. I don’t think you need to get too clever here, so I won’t be adding fennel or caraway seeds, as Wood does, or rosemary (both Franklin and Desmazery); a pinch of thyme and a grating of nutmeg with the leeks will do. Don’t be tempted to gild the lily; this dish is magnificent enough on its own. Prep 10 minChill 30 minCook 1 hr 20 minServes 4-6 1kg fairly large potatoes, preferably waxy ones (eg charlotte or desiree)Salt100g unsmoked bacon lardons, or chopped thick-cut bacon (optional)2 sprigs fresh thyme, picked1 tbsp oil, or butter4 large leeks, trimmed, washed and slicedNutmeg, to taste700g puff pastry (see introduction)Flour, for rolling1 medium soft cheese (eg reblochon, camembert, brie, vacherin, Baron Bigod)1 egg, beaten with a little water Bring a large pan of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, peel and thinly slice the potatoes, add them to the pan and boil for about six to eight minutes, until tender but not falling apart. Drain well. If omitting the bacon, skip to the next step. If not, fry the lardons in a large frying pan over a medium heat until it’s lightly golden and starting to give off its oil. Stir in the thyme, then add the potatoes and toss gently to coat, being careful not to break them up. Season generously, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool completely. Heat the fat over a medium-low heat in the same frying pan, then saute the leeks until soft but not browned. Season with salt and a little nutmeg, and, if you’re not using bacon, add the thyme now as well. Leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, divide the pastry in two, wrap one half well and put it back in the fridge. Roll out the remaining pastry half on a lightly floured surface to about 5mm thick, then cut out a circle the size of a large dinner plate and put on a lined baking sheet. Chill until the filling ingredients are cold. Spread out the cooled leeks in the middle of the pastry circle, leaving a couple of centimetres free around the edges … … then arrange the potato and lardons mix on top. Push the cheese down on top of the potatoes, building the potatoes up around it to give the filling a gently rounded profile. Roll out the second half of the pastry into a circle a little larger than the first. Brush the edges of the filled piece of pastry with egg wash, then carefully drape the second sheet over the top and press down all around the edges to seal. Cut a small hole in the centre of the top, then score curved lines all over the top down from the hole to the edge, being careful not to cut all the way through. Brush with egg, then chill for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Bake the pithivier for 35-45 minutes, until golden, and serve hot.

2/16/2022,"Here is a brutally violent but oddly empowering tale of trafficked women compelled to kick the hell out of each other or else get sent to an Albanian brothel. (Pity poor Albania, which gets chosen to be the film-makers’ idea of the worst possible place ever to be in a brothel.) It is part of a pulpy, under-the-radar film franchise series that revolves around illegal, or semi-legal, fight clubs and mixed martial arts (MMA) bouts that usually pit men against their friends and fellow athletes. Their USP is hardcore hand-to-hand combat, with lots of crunchy foley work providing the sounds of pounded flesh, while still celebrating athletic prowess, loyalty to friends and family and a kind of gladiatorial honour. This latest instalment serves up more of the same, but with women doing most of the punching, stabbing and roundhouse kicks to the head; there are also two women in the screenwriter and director’s chairs, Audrey Arkins and Kellie Madison respectively. The heroine is Chechen refugee Anya (Olivia Popica), who is hoping to get a nursing degree and lives in a tiny flat with her fierce but dim MMA-fighter brother Aslan (Tommy Bastow). When Aslan, the twit, fails to throw a fight like he’s told, the siblings find themselves in debt to evil posh lady Mariah (Brooke Johnston, channelling Ghislaine Maxwell). Mariah persuades Anya, a scrapper in her own right, to take part in some private bouts for the delectation of sadistic rich men who will pay even more to watch pretty ladies beat the daylights out of each other. Of course, it turns out to be a trap and the women are all locked up with each other in a jail and threatened with the aforementioned Albanian brothel option if they don’t cooperate. But plucky Anya starts planning an escape.  Pulpy nonsense, to be sure, but, somehow, this is eminently watchable, and it’s a relief there’s no sexual abuse shown, even if the possibility of it exists. Moreover, it’s interesting and kind of sweet that there’s no love interest for Anya to moon over. Instead, the most significant relationships in the film are between her and her brother, and then later between the women locked up in the makeshift prison, who decide to stop fighting each other and work together to overthrow the patriarchy – sorry, overthrow their traffickers.

2/16/2022,"This new musical is about love – of woman and of country. It’s adapted from Kahlil Gibran’s biographical novel, which the Lebanese writer wrote some time before his hugely popular 1923 work, The Prophet. Set in Beirut, it’s the story of a man who, having immigrated to the US, returns home and falls madly in love; 18 years old in love; “I saw the angels of heaven through the eyes of women” in love; very young, very naive, ever so slightly silly in love. Written by and starring Nadim Naaman, Broken Wings received a semi-staged performance at the Haymarket theatre in 2018. Director Bronagh Lagan then toured the show and now it returns to London, with some of the original cast and a rotating stage. Perhaps intended to inject dynamism into a fairly static production, the rotating feature actually has a strangely stultifying effect (the cast spend a lot of time lining up in rows) and looks a little tired.  Naaman’s score, co-composed with Dana Al Fardan, is best when it’s unabashedly romantic and there’s a particularly handsome swell to the young love song, Here in This Garden. But there’s not a huge amount of variety to the music and surprisingly little of the unique sounds or rhythms of the Middle East. Lagan’s directing and Naaman’s book overplay an already overstated story, which features an evil bishop, saintly mothers (when will this trope end?) and a literally angelic baby. In one scene, we’re shown the bishop describing an evil plan we’ve been told about, in detail, only minutes before. Scenes are often played out and then needlessly summarised by the older Gibran (Naaman) who hovers on the edges of his life story, repeating what does not need to be repeated. It’s a shame because there are some delicate reflections on love and striking singing. Noah Sinigaglia has a sharp purity to her voice as love interest Selma and Soophia Foroughi has an alto voice that could blow down houses. If only she had a juicier role to play than a worshipped mother figure who never quite comes down to earth.

2/16/2022,"When world war three comes, the nuclear bombs drop out of the sky and humanity is wiped from the Earth, two things will remain: cockroaches and NFTs. NFTs have become one of those unavoidable things that you really, really, shouldn’t have to think about, yet here we are. I’m writing about them, and you, inexplicably, are reading it.  Most people still don’t really understand what non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are, to go by the constantly upward trajectory of Google search trends, and even those that do sometimes struggle to come up with meaningful use cases for them. NFTs are unique digital items stored on the Ethereum blockchain. They’re most commonly associated with and connected to pieces of individual “artwork” (your mileage may vary, depending on how strongly you wrap inverted commas around that word), which are exchanged for eye-wateringly large sums of money. It’s that last bit that makes them so interesting. Paris Hilton, Jimmy Fallon and Gwyneth Paltrow all own NFTs, which they bought using a middleman company called MoonPay, and have begun talking about them on national TV. (If you want to know what the people who previously owned those specific NFTs thought of their new owners, then I have a story for you). Generally, if the penpushers at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) begin sniffing around something, you can assume that it is hurtling into the mainstream. And those eye-wateringly large sums of money have also made NFTs interesting to the taxman. We learned this week that HMRC has made its first NFT seizures as part of an investigation into a suspected attempt to defraud the taxman of more than £1m. “Our first seizure of a Non-Fungible Token serves as a warning to anyone who thinks they can use cryptoassets to hide money from HMRC,” said Nick Sharp, the deputy director for economic crime at HMRC. Monkey business I have done my fair share of reporting on NFTs, and a depressingly large proportion of stories have been about how someone has been conned – whether that be having money stolen directly, or investing in a project that wasn’t what it claimed to be. While not every NFT project is a scam – far from it – the sector is experiencing a wild west gold rush that is attracting plenty of people willing to sacrifice the long-term reputation of an entire technology in order to make a quick buck for themselves. And it is a gold rush. In 2020, blockchain market research company Chainalysis recorded $106m of NFT trades in 2020. A year later, that was $44.2bn. Individuals like Damian Augustyniak, a 30-year-old Polish artist who makes more than £40,000 a month designing the artwork for NFT projects – and who told me he was able to tell me exactly how many people he employed because he’d just meticulously filled out his tax return – are few and far between. It makes sense that people don’t always declare their income from NFTs. The whole premise of Web3, of which NFTs are one part, is that it’s free from the shackles of The Man. The decentralised future of the internet is designed to be a kind of ‘make your own rules’ space, where as a group you decide what to do. It’s a bit like Lord of the Flies – with all the potential issues that could ensue. The fact that all the transactions take place outside the realm of fiat currency, with NFTs bought and traded using cryptocurrencies, compounds that. Yet it’s also one of the biggest things that is likely to be a stumbling block to more widespread adoption of NFTs. It’s also why tax authorities like HMRC are likely to spend more time scrutinising the flow of cash in exchange for jpg images. Money for nothing? Chainalysis believes a significant proportion of the NFT market is wash trading – people selling NFTs to themselves in order to hike up the price. The company has pinpointed 262 users who have sold an NFT to another user account they also own more than 25 times. “While we can’t be 100% sure that all instances of NFT sales to self-financed wallets are intended for wash trading, the 25-transaction threshold gives us a higher degree of confidence that these users are habitual wash traders,” they write. Hilariously, most of them have lost money. But those who won, won big – counteracting the bumbling traders’ losses. More than $8.5m in profit was made by wash traders in 2021: a lot of cash that tax authorities would probably want to take their share of. Same for the money laundering, nearly $1.5m of which Chainalysis alleges was used in the last three months of 2021 to buy NFTs. It makes for sobering reading for both sides: tax authorities are missing out on huge amounts of questionable money flowing through massive marketplaces. And those trying to launder ill-gotten gains are starting to see the enemy coming over the hill, keeping an eye out on what they’re doing. HMRC’s seizures are just the tip of the iceberg: earlier this month the US Department of the Treasury also gave a warning to the NFT world that it was watching them – and expected them to add the value of their art to their annual tax returns. So, feel free to “ape in” (crypto speak for getting very excited and rushing into buy in) to NFTs, if you want. But let’s be honest: filling out your tax return is difficult enough without trying to quantify the value of a pixelated monkey.

2/16/2022,"“How do you ignore the context?” Kylian Mbappé asked. “Easy: play football.” And better than anyone else. Everybody knew he was special, a World Cup winner at 19, his goal in the final against Croatia one of more than 200 he has scored already aged 23, the man for whom Paris Saint-Germain turned down €200m even as they knew that would probably mean losing him for free, but this was still a moment that hit you in the face. It hit Mauricio Pochettino, at least. Asked what he felt when Mbappé scored the 94th-minute winner here against Real Madrid, the PSG coach replied: “Two things. First, happiness. Then, pain. Leandro Paredes leapt into me so hard that I thought I had broken my nose.” Along the touchline, Mbappé was going wild, teammates piling in. There was no choreography, and no apology either, no sign of mixed emotions, just release. Maybe a touch of vindication too. There, told you.  He told everyone, on all sides. The Parc des Princes erupted, except in the corner where they had cheered Mbappé before the game, applauding as his name was read out. Madrid’s fans had serenaded him then and were quiet now, but there was admiration and anticipation too. From many Madrid supporters, not so much here as elsewhere, there was soon something that looked like celebration. Mbappé had received the ball below them, pushing Madrid back into their area one last time, then gone between Lucas Vázquez and Éder Militão and put the ball between Thibaut Courtois’ legs and into the net. “To concede a silly goal at the end is hard to take,” the goalkeeper said, but that’s not how you spell bloody brilliant. “It was really stupid to lose the ball, he goes away from two people too easily and then I have the bad luck that it goes through my legs,” Courtois reasoned, but this was about the fusion of grace and power, the speed and smoothness with which he leant one way then the next. The way he went through the middle of two men, gone before those doors could slide shut on him, like Ronaldo: the original one, not the one whose posters decorated Mbappé’s bedroom wall. “In the end he showed his quality and class; that’s why he’s the best player in the world,” Courtois concluded. “Unstoppable,” Carlo Ancelotti called him. For an hour and a half Madrid had managed to stop him, just about. He had turned away from Casemiro in the first minute and decided it in the very last. Between times, he had torn into them, looking like the only athlete in the company of elite athletes, pulling away with apparent ease, elegance in every stride. As if it is just the athleticism. Seventy touches, seven shots, four dribbles, a penalty won, and now a match too. Not just any match either, and not in any way. “We tried to control him, to double up on him, and Militão did well, but he can always invent something,” Ancelotti said. “And in the last minute he invented something.” Madrid’s manager called him the best in Europe. PSG’s manager claimed that he didn’t have the words to say how good Mbappé is. “I can’t describe him,” he said. Pochettino is a man who over the past few days has looked as if he doesn’t enjoy Paris much, all the things – and, yes, all the people too – that come with coaching this club. But Mbappé comes with them too, and he appears different, not so blinded by the lights. “Mbappé isn’t like the rest,” Danilo said. He was ostensibly talking about the talent, but it could be the temperament too. “He is incredibly mature,” Pochettino said. “I am lucky to have been able to work with him every day over the last year.” There may not be long left, but these are months that might not have happened at all, and they are to be enjoyed. It was mostly pride that meant PSG refused to let Mbappé leave, Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez, complaining that it is not normal for a club to turn down a bid that big for a player in the last year of his contract and Nasser al-Khelaifi, PSG’s president, admitting that the relationship between the clubs is broken. It felt like financial folly too, however rich they are, but in that moment on Tuesday night it felt worth it even at €200m for a single season. If Mbappé does deliver the European Cup that obsesses them, it certainly will. And then he can go, if he goes, as a hero. Their first will always be the best and it would always be his. After this game, he again insisted that a decision on his future had not been made. Asked whether this might change that, he replied “no, no, no, no, no”, the fact that he said so in almost flawless Spanish feeling as significant as the fact that he said it all. The fact that he was asked underlining that there was no escaping the context to this game, even if Mbappé said doing so was easy, which football often seems to be to him. After the way he played here, there can be no reproach – from either side. From Madrid – from fans and media, probably from the directors up in the palco too – there was something celebratory in defeat. Only those who seek no consolation find no consolation the phrase runs and it came in losing to Mbappé, his performance reinforcing that they were right to go for him and that with him the future is theirs, deepening the excitement over what is still assumed to be the imminent arrival of the player who will mark a generation. “How good is Mbappé!” the cover of Marca ran. “Mbappé is the bomb,” cheered AS. And soon they trust he will be theirs, and for free. Madrid may not win this year’s Champions League thanks to this goal but that very moment helped further convince them that if he does come it won’t be long before they do. That he had beaten them like this was welcome in a way, another dimension added: this was an exhibition of ethics as well as excellence. Mbappé had previously said that he would not talk to other clubs when they were opponents, any decision having to wait until after this tie or even the summer. There was work to do first, matches to win, staring with the one where the spotlight shone on him brighter than ever. “I said I was going to give everything, and I did,” he noted. “We ask so many questions, we say too many things.” He had just wanted to play football, which he does like no one else.",Sport/Football,Magical Mbappé makes Real Madrid smile even in sending them to defeat | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/16/kylian-mbappe-real-madrid-smile-defeat-next-season-psg
2/16/2022,"Marks & Spencer is to increase minimum pay by more than 5% to £10 an hour and offer free health checks to workers as labour shortages force up wages across the retail and hospitality industries. The rise puts M&S workers just ahead of the new legal minimum wage of £9.50 an hour for those 23 and over that comes into force in April, and is on par with supermarkets including Sainsbury’s and Morrisons.  M&S, which experienced a turnaround in fortunes at Christmas, said that from the beginning of April more than 40,000 staff in the UK would see their base rate of pay increase by 50p an hour to £10, with rates in London rising to £11.25 from £10.75. New benefits will also include access to an online GP service, health check screening and advice on financial management. Steve Rowe, the chief executive of M&S, said: “The contribution our teams have made to support our customers and each other every day through some really challenging times has been remarkable. By once again increasing our investment into one of the best all-round reward offers for store colleagues across retail, we’re making sure that every colleague, whatever they do and wherever they work, is properly rewarded and supported at M&S.” The pay rise is the latest in a wave of increases across retail and hospitality. In January, Sainsbury’s said it would increase hourly pay by more than 5% to £10 an hour for its lowest-paid shop workers. Aldi increased minimum hourly rates for shop workers to £10.57 an hour from £9.55 nationally this month, a near 11% rise, and £11.32 in Greater London from £11.07. Next has said it will have to put up the price of its clothing by as much as 6% this autumn as the fashion and homewares retailer expects average wages to rise by more than 5% this year. Hospitality businesses are also upping wages. Pret a Manger last month raised hourly pay for the second time in four months from a minimum of £9.40 to £9.80, with more than 6,900 of its 8,500 staff earning at least £10 an hour. That came after pay was put up 5% to £9.40 an hour in September. Workers at the coffee shops chain are also able to earn an additional £1.25 an hour, based on a weekly mystery shopper assessment, up from £1.",News/Business,M&S to raise minimum pay to £10 an hour and offer free health checks,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/16/marks-and-spencer-to-raise-minimum-pay-and-offer-free-health-checks
