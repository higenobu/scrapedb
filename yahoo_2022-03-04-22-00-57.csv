3/4/2022,"By Timothy Gardner WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Thursday to ban U.S. imports of Russian oil, saying the shipments could be replaced by boosting output in North America and other places. The bill would have to pass the Senate and House and be signed by President Joe Biden to become law, but the White House has indicated reluctance to support moves that could increase the price of gasoline at a time when inflation is already high. The bill, Banning Russian Energy Imports Act, is intended to punish President Vladimir Putin over his invasion of Ukraine and is sponsored by 18 senators in the 100-member chamber, including Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat, and Lisa Murkowski, a Republican. Similar legislation has been offered by Senator Ed Markey, a liberal Democrat. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi also said she supports a ban. ""I'm all for that,"" she told reporters. ""Ban the oil coming from Russia."" The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether Biden, a Democrat, would sign the bill. ""I don't believe this country should be importing anything from Russia,"" Jon Tester, a Democrat from oil-producing Montana who supports the Manchin-Murkowski bill, told reporters. ""It will send even a bigger message that the United States is in this with Ukrainians for the long haul."" It was unclear if the bill will win the 60 votes in the Senate that are likely necessary for it to pass, but the fact that several Democrats are co-sponsoring it increases its chances. The United States imported more than 20.4 million barrels of crude and refined products a month on average in 2021 from Russia, about 8% of U.S. liquid fuel imports, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). On Thursday, Par Pacific Holdings became the first U.S. refiner to suspend purchases of Russian oil for its Hawaii-based refinery. Russia accounted for nearly 28% of Hawaii's crude imports last year, according to the EIA. Russia is the second-largest exporter of crude oil, shipping out 4 to 5 million barrels of crude every day, trailing only Saudi Arabia. A series of sanctions imposed by the West, while exempting Russian oil and gas, have nonetheless disrupted global oil trade, as buyers shun Russian barrels and search for supply elsewhere. 'PAD PUTIN'S POCKETS' Russia produces about 10% of the world's crude and, while it has imposed a series of sanctions on Russia since the conflict in Ukraine has escalated, the Biden administration has so far been careful to not take actions that could send oil prices higher. ""We don't have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy... that would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters on Thursday. Psaki said a ban on U.S. imports of crude from Russia could further increase oil prices, which hit decade-long highs this week. Retail gasoline prices have been steadily rising in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer; the average per-gallon price for regular gasoline was $3.73 on Thursday, according to the American Automobile Association. ""It also has the potential to pad the pockets of President Putin which is exactly what we are not trying to do,"" Psaki said. Russia's economy is heavily dependent on oil and gas and many of its energy companies are state-owned. Still, Biden has said everything is on the table in terms of punishing Russia. Backers of the bill said it would only affect Russian oil exports to the United States and that U.S., Canadian and other supplies from allies could replace the Russian barrels without boosting prices. Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, who has not backed the Manchin-Murkowksi bill, said ""this is not the moment"" for Congress to be setting a different direction from the Biden administration. Murphy did seem to support the idea in theory of limiting Russian oil imports, however. ""It still feels like the right thing to do,"" he told reporters, adding that any move in that direction should be done in coordination with Europe. White House deputy national security adviser Daleep Singh said on Wednesday the Biden administration was looking at reducing U.S. consumption of Russian oil while maintaining the global supply of energy. ""There are other producers in the world that could backfill for any Russian oil we don't import,"" Singh said on CNN.

3/4/2022,"Investors may be disappointed in guidance for renewable energy stocks, but the Ukraine situation has changed everything—there are tons of buying opportunities in this sector right now. All attention might be on crude oil as the Russian invasion of Ukraine hits day seven, but it’s a distraction that sets the stage for potential rewards for investors who take advantage of cut-rate deals on clean energy stocks. Take First Solar Inc (FSLR), for example. It’s fallen around 50% since November 1, 2021. On Tuesday alone, shares lost another 16% because investors were disappointed in guidance. FSLR missed Q4 revenue expectations, and Wall Street was expecting its full-year guidance to be $2.76 billion. Instead, FSLR set guidance between $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion. Most of that weak guidance has been based on what First Solar CEO Mark Widmar described as “supply chain, logistics, cost and pandemic-related challenges”. Further, Widmar said he expected those supply-chain issues to persist for 2022 earnings. Overall, solar stocks plunged further Wednesday, with First Solar’s results dragging others down, too. Array Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:ARRY), a solar equipment manufacturer, had shed over 20% by 1:30pm EST Wednesday, with Canadian Solar (NASDAQ:CSIQ) down over 4%, Enphase Energy (NASDAQ:ENPH) down over 5%, and SolarEdge Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SEDG) down similarly. That follows a brief rally for solar stocks in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But that rally might not be over, and this might be the perfect time to buy into cheap renewable energy stocks. What is happening in Ukraine is a wake-up call for a world overly dependent on fossil fuels and the geopolitics that comes along with them. While the market may be fickle enough to spark a rally one day and then shift focus entirely back to Covid-related fundamentals, the war in Ukraine has much wider-reaching implications for the energy sector. Wall Street’s attention will come back around to Ukraine with respect to clean energy stocks. Energy security risks, wildly rising desperation to diversify countries’ energy portfolios, and $100+ oil prices will drive Wall Street’s attention back where it belongs, making it a prime time to scoop up cheaper-than-ever renewable stocks. Europe’s desperation to create some sort of sense of energy security will override all else. A flurry of news releases back this up. Germany has just announced plans to build two new LNG terminals to reduce dependence on Russian gas. While that, in itself, does nothing for renewable energy stocks, it does indicate that an about-face on energy is about to hit Europe, and clean energy plans will be sped up with the momentum of war behind them. Carbon-reducing plans have just been injected with a brand new sense of urgency that nothing short of a war on the continent could provide. The suspension of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany was just the beginning–the first indicator. The urgency is palpable because Russia provides some 40% of Europe’s energy, and Europe imports 90% of the gas it consumes. For now, Russian deliveries have not been interrupted, but prices are soaring and sanctions could get in the way. Better late than never, the situation in Ukraine prompted the European Union to draft a new energy strategy that plans to significantly reduce that dependence (by 40%). Part of the plan will entail a much faster process for permitting new renewable energy projects. In addition to new gas storage rules that are expected to be unveiled next week, the EU plans to cut the bloc’s reliance on gas by 23% by 2030. Investors looking to get ahead of Wall Street’s day-on-day-off sentiments should be focusing on these major drivers of the clean energy sector. While solar stocks have just taken a beating thanks to First Solar’s guidance, wind stocks, too, surged at the start of the Russian invasion and then started sinking on Tuesday and Wednesday as Wall Street reverted to earnings reports and guidance. Two weeks ago, Vestas Wind Systems (OTCMKTS:VWDRY) reported a sharp drop in profits and signaled a drop in orders for wind turbines. The Russian invasion boosted them up again, only to plunge yet again as the invasion moved into its 6th and 7th days, ignoring the wider trend here. Likewise, VanEck Vectors Low Carbon Energy ETF (NYSEARCA:SMOG) dropped today on Wall Street sentiments, but over the past 5 days is trading up over 11%. If you missed the first buying opportunity that saw stocks like Sunrun (NYSE:RUN) gain nearly 37% since the Russian invasion began, this week’s dip on earnings and supply-chain fears presents a second-chance opportunity.
