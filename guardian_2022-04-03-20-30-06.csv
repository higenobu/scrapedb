4/3/2022,"From Mykolaiv to Kyiv and Kharkiv, second-hand cars, pickup trucks and minivans bought in Britain and still bearing the familiar UK number plates are on the frontline of the war in Ukraine. The incongruous sight is thanks to a fighters’ fund established by Serhiy Prytula, 40, a Ukrainian actor and comedian, who made his name with a Little Britain-style sketch show Faina Yukraina (Nice Ukraine) but now acts as an alternative quartermaster to the Ukrainian armed forces. The British vehicles are attractively priced, roughly half the cost of their equivalent makes on mainland Europe, as right-hand cars are not in high demand internationally, according to Prytula, speaking in his office in his headquarters in Kyiv, a six-storey office building taken over for the purposes of acting as a collection and distribution centre for donations. He estimates that he currently receives about £7m a month in donations with which to stockpile and distribute military equipment, ranging from bulletproof vests and thermal telescopes to binoculars, drones, medical kits and electrical generators. With a portion of those funds, the British cars are bought from both second-hand dealerships and individuals in the UK who will offer them for a cut price, sometimes accepting cryptocurrency as payment, before being ferried across the Channel and driven to Ukraine on the back of trucks – a journey of five to six days. They are then distributed across to the frontline to where Ukraine’s forces are most in need. Twenty British cars have been dispatched so far – their journeys to the battlefront are known as “hell rides” to the volunteers in Kyiv – and a further 20 are in the process of being purchased. The Prytula volunteer hub has passed a total of 60 vehicles from across Europe to the armed forces. In Prytula’s office, there are fragments of a Russian jet, weapons and bloodstained military clothing, including a balaclava and gloves taken from Russian soldiers killed on the battlefield. He described the grisly collection as “feedback” as to the value of the cars. He said: “It’s really helped because our units create mobile groups. And behind you, you can see a piece of Russian jet Su-34. That’s exactly a gift from our soldiers. We help them with a pickup and he destroyed this Russian plane and this was something like feedback for us. “The first thing that they brought here was this piece of shit Russian jet and a piece of Russian rocket calibre and after that, I made a post on Facebook and I said you can bring here everything you want, ‘But no dead Russians here.’ The next day they brought clothing, a radio transmitter and hat from a Russian tank driver and after that they started sending everything they found on the bodies.” Maksym Kostetskyi, who has been managing the purchase of vehicles from the UK, said demand from Ukrainian units was three times the level of supply, with units seeking cars, pickup trucks and SUVs. He said: “There is a long waiting list. But we are very hopeful in that we have partners in the United Kingdom who are giving and providing the vehicles with lower prices. “Especially for pickup trucks and used vehicles mostly. Yes, and these SUVs are usually like £4,000 or £5,000 each. Usually in Europe, people don’t buy them because they have right-hand drive, but during this time in the war times and in the field this is a great time to buy them.” British cars were also used when Russian forces first invaded the east of Ukraine in 2014. “A lot of Ukrainian soldiers, they know how to drive this car with the steering wheel on the other side,” Prytula said. When the cars are formally taken over by the Ukrainian army, their number plates will be blacked out. But in the early weeks of the war that has rarely happened, with the priority being to get the cars in action rather than deal with the paperwork. Kostetskyi said: “We have partners over there that want to help Ukrainians and want to support all of us all the way they can. And we do believe that this is one of the biggest ways that the society and people of United Kingdom could support us as buying the same cars in other countries in the European Union costs twice as much.”",News/World news,Why second-hand British cars end up on Ukraine’s frontline,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/03/why-second-hand-british-cars-end-up-on-ukraines-frontline

4/3/2022,"There are few actors who can do more with just their eyes than Nina Hoss (a regular collaborator of the director Christian Petzold, she was most recently seen in Stéphanie Chuat and Véronique Reymond’s My Little Sister). Here, she builds an entire character – angular, complex, frequently contradictory – out of flickering glances and the fretful crease between her brows. She is perfect casting in German director Ina Weisse’s drama in which so much is left unvoiced, in which secrets hang in the air like a jarring, discordant note in a concert performance. Hoss plays Anna, a violin teacher at a prestigious conservatoire. She is, like her instrument, highly strung. There’s an anguished hunger in those eyes when she first hears new pupil Alexander (Ilja Monti) play. His technique is raw, but she spots his talent and argues his case with her dismissive colleagues. But her quest to shape the boy into an audition-ready virtuoso becomes all-consuming – chilling her marriage to Philippe (Simon Abkarian) and distancing her son, Jonas (Serafin Mishiev), also a student at the conservatoire. The slow creep of the camera mirrors the incremental build in pressure; this is the kind of tension that feels like a tightening chokehold on the audience.",Arts/Film,The Audition review – Nina Hoss gives a virtuoso performance,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/03/the-audition-review-nina-hoss-gives-a-virtuoso-performance
4/3/2022,"Earlier this year, a number of theatre professionals shared, via Twitter, stories of being rejected for jobs because their “only” theatre experience involved working with young people. So wrong! As this world premiere of Roald Dahl’s short story, along with other productions reviewed on these pages over the past few weeks, demonstrates, youth theatre requires at least as much skill as supposedly “adult” theatre. Here, it demands even more. Not only must director Ben Harrison and his talented company transport their audience to an Indian jungle, London casinos, the world of social media etc, they must – and do – present seemingly impossible feats of magic. Social media? The original story of the transformation of debonair Henry Sugar (David Rankine) from spoilt rich man to selfless philanthropist is, of course, computer-free. However, Rob Drummond’s adaptation extends Dahl’s Chinese box-style narrative to include a new character, teenager Mary (Eve Buglass), alone in her bedroom (in Becky Minto’s inspired design, this is an actual box that moves around the many-curtained stage as freely as the laptop screen it mimics). For Henry and Mary, “enough is never enough”: he craves money, she solicits followers for her just-created social media account. Their lives are transformed by their separate encounters with a book/ebook in which India-based Dr Cartwright (Rosalind Sydney) narrates the story of Imhrat Khan (Johndeep More), the man “who could see without using his eyes”. Through Mary, Drummond introduces a cautionary-tale quality to the story that effectively highlights the message of the Roald Dahl Story Company (a co-producer along with Perth theatre and Helen Milne Productions) about “the power of kindness”. This moral focus blunts Dahl’s ironic narrative tone, but it builds a dramatic impetus necessary to the stage action (further enlivened by wittily managed direct interactions with the audience, who threatened, on press night, to upstage the actors – a man leaping up to defend his wife’s honour from Sugar/Rankine’s flirty ad lib raised a gale of laughter and round of applause). As to feats described in the story – of levitation, mind-reading, seeing through solid objects – the combined talents of the cast with Fergus Dunnet (illusions), Simon Wilkinson (lighting), Scott Twynholm (sound and music) and Lewis den Hertog (projections) work magic. In youth theatre, as in all theatre, seeing is believing.
