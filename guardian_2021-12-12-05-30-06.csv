12/12/2021,"Saudi Arabia has opened its first international film festival amid accusations that the government is using culture to whitewash its poor human rights record, just days after similar controversy shadowed its first time hosting a Formula One race. The Red Sea festival attracted international stars including Hilary Swank, Clive Owen and Vincent Cassel. Saudi Arabia presented it as a moment of change for a country that only lifted a ban on cinemas four years ago, a position embraced by some of those walking the red carpet.  But the gala has for months been the target of boycott calls from critics who warn that the glamour of show-business is being deployed by Saudi authorities to distract international attention from rights abuses within the country and beyond. Under crown prince and de facto ruler Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi officials have crushed political dissent at home and pursued critics beyond the country’s borders, most notoriously murdering journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a consulate in Turkey. The prince has also been widely condemned for directing Saudi Arabia’s intervention in the brutal civil war in Yemen, which is now enduring one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. “A film festival without freedom of expression quickly descends into propaganda,” said Madawi Al-Rasheed, a professor at LSE and prominent critic of the Saudi government. “Sport and art will never be a substitute for real reform that includes civil and political rights. International films are used as a cover for a sinister scenario of detentions, beheadings and murder by a regime that is desperate to break its isolation after it committed crimes in Yemen and against its own citizens.” When the festival was announced earlier this year, Oscar-nominated film director Sami Khan was among voices calling for artists to stay away, in protest against Saudi Arabia’s disturbing record on human rights. “The international film community should not allow itself to be bought and used by Saudi Arabia to whitewash horrific atrocities,” he said in a public statement. He said he expected to suffer financial implications and attacks on his reputation for the public stance, but cited others who had also condemned the festival. “I probably will pay a price for this … but I’m increasingly disturbed by the way repressive governments are using the global film industry to launder their reputations.” Other critics include Orwa Nyrabia, a Syrian filmmaker and artistic director of International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam, who spoke out against the festival in 2019, when plans were first unveiled before the coronavirus pandemic. Human Rights Watch called for celebrities planning appearances in Saudi Arabia linked to the Formula One race held earlier this month to either use their platforms to raise concerns about human rights, or stay away. “On the surface, the festivities are meant to show race attendees having an amazing time. But a look beneath the hood makes clear that the Saudi government’s intent is to use these celebrities to whitewash its abysmal human rights record,” the campaign group said. “Saudi Arabia has a history of using celebrities and major international events to deflect scrutiny from its pervasive abuses.” Khashoggi’s fiancee had also made an open appeal to Canadian singer Justin Bieber to cancel a performance there, warning that his celebrity would “be used to restore the reputation of a regime that kills its critics.” He went ahead with the 5 December performance. Ahead of the race, F1 world champion Lewis Hamilton said he is not comfortable competing in Saudi Arabia given its “terrifying” laws regarding the LGBTQ+ community. He once more called on Formula One to do more to address human rights issues in the countries it visits.",News/World news,"Saudi film festival is a ‘whitewash’ by authorities, say critics",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/11/critics-condemn-saudi-film-festival-as-a-whitewash
12/12/2021,"After a year and a half of pouring blood, sweat and tears, Demi Skipper has successfully taken one single hair pin and traded it up all the way to a house. In May this year, the Guardian spoke to her after she’d traded three tractors for one of only a few Chipotle celebrity cards in the world, worth about $20,000. She had been inspired by Kyle MacDonald, who in 2006 traded a red paperclip all the way to a house, and hoped to reach her goal by summer’s end.  Only a few months later than hoped, Skipper, who is 29, has been handed the keys to a little house near Nashville, Tennessee. No mortgage. No fees. And not a penny spent (except on shipping). The modest ‘fixer upper’ house, complete with a big garden, is her 28th trade since she embarked on her project in May 2020. Skipper, who also has a full time job as a product lead at Cash App, set out on her journey during lockdown and documented it to her (then) zero TikTok followers. “There were just so many negative people saying it wasn’t possible. I was willing to do this for five years if that’s what it took to get to the house.” She beams: “I wake up and I’m like ‘is this real?’ I have the house. I traded this from a bobby pin!” When Skipper revealed one of her last trades – a Chipotle celebrity card – to her almost five million TikTok followers, she was met with an unexpected backlash of criticism. The card gives the owner unlimited free food from Chipotle for a year, plus a catered dinner for 50 people, and is worth about $20,000. Many said she had made the worst decision of her journey yet, and that she would never find someone who would trade it for an item of the same value. Determined to prove them wrong, Skipper planned out her strategy to find her next trade. She began looking at celebrities who were big fans of the fast food chain. If a celebrity was so much as pictured eating Chipotle, they were probably on Skipper’s radar. A couple of NFL players were close to trading, but they fell through. After months of searching, she got an email from “Chipotle’s biggest fan”, a woman called Alyssa who runs a flower company in Canada. Alyssa agreed to trade an off-the-grid trailer with a Tesla powerwall and solar panels worth $40,000 for the card. After the trade was made official, Skipper got Alyssa on a call with representatives of Chipotle, which almost brought her to tears as she is such a big fan of their food. Skipper said: “That was a really cool moment. I found the one person who cares about this card. I found her in the world.” (Alyssa works at a women’s shelter and plans to donate some of the free Chipotle food to the shelter.) But Skipper quickly fell from cloud nine as one of the most complicated battles of her trading journey was about to begin. After figuring out a way to get the trailer from Canada to the US with closed borders due to Covid, she was told that the wheels on the trailer were illegal in the US and couldn’t be replaced. The company that makes the trailers hadn’t “paid their dues” to the US Department of Transportation and until they did, Skipper’s trailer was stuck in Canada. After calling transportation department every day for weeks and offering to file the paperwork herself, she had to wait three months to be able to bring the trailer home. Finally one of her followers volunteered to pick up the trailer and hold it on her drive near the US border, so Skipper and her husband decided to make the 15-hour road trip to Canada to see, photograph, and decorate the trailer. It turned out to be one of the most life-changing car journeys of Skipper’s life. As they drove it home, Skipper immediately started looking for her next trade. She messaged a woman who showed some interest, and the two started chatting on the phone while Skipper’s husband drove. The woman on the phone asked Skipper, “Are you sitting down?” before explaining that she was a house flipper who owned about 15 different houses at any given time. She had been following Skipper’s journey from the beginning and was waiting for the right trade – and this trailer was it. Skipper was being offered a house in Tennessee. The day after Thanksgiving she was on a flight to Nashville, and after a meal with the woman she had saved in her phone as “Final House Lady”, she had the keys in her hand. She ran up to the house and started crying in the huge front garden. The house – which has two small bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and a bathroom – was “perfect”. Skipper and her husband are leaving their rental home in San Francisco and are moving to Tennessee to renovate and live in their house. There’s a plan in the works to trade the original bobby pin back for something and frame it in their new home. The Trade Me project may look like a smooth journey – it was anything but. From broken cars to diamond necklaces worth less than expected, as the disappointments mounted, many people would have cut their losses. But Skipper never gave up: “I think I’ve gotten much better at seeing the negative and flipping it to a positive,” she explains. “Had someone said that someone was going to trade something that’s worth not even a single penny for a house that’s worth millions of times more, I feel like people would say it’s impossible. But this makes me feel like anything is possible now.” Remembering her grainy first TikTok video, in which she shakily filmed her hand holding the bobby pin and then her computer screen showing her posting it to Craigslist, because she didn’t understand how the app worked, Skipper says: “It makes no sense. I was not supposed to be the person that did this. But I became that person and now I have an entire house. I don’t think you have to be that person who’s supposed to do it.” After such a back-breaking challenge, Skipper’s going to do it all over again – and is hoping to donate the next house to someone who needs it. “I was the second person to do it once. But I want to be the first person to do it twice,” she smiles.",Lifestyle/Life and style,From hairpin to house: woman who mastered ‘trading up’ realizes dream,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/dec/11/demi-skipper-trade-me-project-bobby-pin-house
12/12/2021,"After his Roma side had lost 1-0 at Bologna, José Mourinho pursued the referee Luca Pairetto down the tunnel, enraged at the bookings that meant Tammy Abraham and Rick Karsdorp would be suspended for last weekend’s game against Internazionale. “I’ll have to invent the lineup on Saturday,” he later told the media. “Luckily, I replaced Gianluca Mancini. Otherwise, he may have been booked too.” With his captain Lorenzo Pellegrini out with a muscular problem and Stephan El Shaarawy suffering a calf problem, Mourinho had to field a weakened lineup against Inter – and nobody could be in any doubt that that was not Mourinho’s fault. Although it was his decision to leave last season’s top scorer, Borja Mayoral, on the bench.  Roma were 3-0 down by half-time, the first time that has ever happened to Mourinho. That was the final score, only his second home defeat in Serie A, prompting a classic Mourinho press conference. First he refused to take questions, telling journalists: “Your job is a lot easier than ours which is why we earn a lot more than you.” Then he delivered a brief but characteristic monologue, making clear that a) the task was essentially impossible – “Inter are objectively better than us. This became an extremely difficult match tonight because of absentees”; and b) they had nearly won anyway and would have done if only the players had done their jobs better – “We had three big chances, two of which came at 0-0.” It was not, to repeat, his fault. Roma sat seventh in the league before this weekend’s fixtures, nine points off Champions League qualification and eight points worse off than at the equivalent stage last season, a situation, in the space of four days, Mourinho had blamed on a referee, injuries, the media, fate and his own players. At which point the temptation is to check the calendar. But no, it is still 2021: Mourinho has been at Roma for only six months. It’s just that the doom cycle comes round quicker and quicker these days. Once, back near the beginning of his reign, these things took three years. A season to build, a season of fulfilment, a season of recrimination and acrimony. But the friction started to get earlier and earlier until at Tottenham it happened after 18 months. At Roma, it has taken barely 18 weeks. Phase one, early promise, concluded on 19 September as a run of six straight wins in all competitions ended with defeat at Verona. Phase two, the wobble that in the old days would have led to investment and improvement, came to a spectacular end with the 6-1 Europa League defeat to Bodø/Glimt on 21 October and Mourinho’s condemnation of his second string. Since when there has been only stagnation and increasing frustration. There has even been talk of him taking over at Everton: the fly cast to see what fish might still be willing to bite. This ends only one way: the only questions are how long the decoupling takes and how toxic it becomes. In part this is Roma. They finished eighth last season and while bringing in Abraham, Marash Kumbulla, Eldor Shomurodov, Matías Viña and Rui Patrício for Edin Dzeko, Pedro and Pau López at a net cost of £100m may have improved the age profile of the squad, it hasn’t necessarily made it much stronger in the short term. But mainly it is Mourinho, who increasingly resembles the Wizard of Oz begging the world to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain. The Porto players he led to the Champions League in 2004 may still sound like members of a cult, in thrall to a manager who took them to implausible heights (they remain the only Champions League winners from outside the big four leagues since 1995), but fresh devotees are increasingly rare. Back then his control was such it seemed he could foresee the future, issuing instructions, for instance, for how to respond when a player was sent off against Benfica, as he subsequently was. Mourinho’s Chelsea players spoke of his planning, the preparation for various eventualities. He was, perhaps, the last of the personality coaches, somebody whose greatest gift was his capacity to inspire by charismatic authority. As that has waned, partly through familiarity and partly perhaps because younger players do not respond to him in the way that, say, Costinha, John Terry and Marco Materazzi did, so Mourinho’s powers have weakened. If he still prepares with the same meticulousness, it is apparent only in his post-match catalogues of his players’ failings. What makes it worse is that there is no grand philosophy to fall back on, no processes to instil. Certainly from 2008 onwards, Mourinho’s approach has been a negative: he was what Barcelona and Pep Guardiola were not. The school of attritional Portuguese football that moulded him is in retreat. Mourinho, Fernando Santos and Nuno Espírito Santo all feel outmoded, their reluctance to press anachronistic in the modern game. That has left Mourinho exposed. All managers are to an extent dependent on their capacity to persuade players to buy in to their projects, but those who have a coherent process are less vulnerable to the fickleness of interpersonal relationships. Mourinho, though, does not believe in practising preset moves; rather he prefers to use guided discovery to establish in the players the mentality to make the right decisions. The problem is, if the players do not believe in him, they are far less susceptible to his conditioning. Which makes Roma’s decision to appoint him baffling. This was not like Tottenham, where the belief seems to have been that there was a squad almost ready for a trophy and all it needed was the final push of a messianic winner. That might at least have suited Mourinho once. But Roma, by Mourinho’s own account, “don’t want success today. They want a sustainable project for the future.” Mourinho has never offered that. So all that remains is the toxic endgame, as he looks to evade responsibility for declining form. It begins earlier and earlier with every passing job. Soon, there may be nothing else.",Sport/Football,Toxic endgame looms for José Mourinho as doom cycle comes round ever quicker | Jonathan Wilson,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/11/toxic-endgame-looms-for-jose-mourinho-as-doom-cycle-comes-round-ever-quicker
12/12/2021,"Hello again. The day that Carlo Ancelotti returned to Real Madrid, a chance conversation about something completely different unexpectedly bringing him back to Spain six years later, he looked around Valdebebas and saw familiar faces everywhere, comfort in the lack of change. “The same physios, the same kit men, the same journalists, the same vision, the same demands of greatness,” as he put it. “Everything is immutable: the only thing that changes is the coach.” It is there, anyway. Since he left, Madrid have been through five of them: Rafa Benítez, Zinedine Zidane, Julen Lopetegui, Santi Solari and Zidane again. Barcelona have been through six. By contrast, Sunday’s opponents from across the capital – rivals who have proven as big as Barcelona, at least for Ancelotti – have not been through any. Atlético Madrid have changed homes, moving out of the Vicente Calderón and heading to the Metropolitano 22km north-east, but not their coach. And so a familiar face awaits Ancelotti at the Santiago Bernabéu.  Diego Simeone was in charge at Atlético when Ancelotti came the first time and was in charge when he left. He was still in charge when Ancelotti came the second time and it is no great leap to suggest he still will be when the Italian goes again. It will be a decade this month, not 14 years as Ancelotti said, but Simeone is different, an outlier now. Not just in Spain but anywhere. And not just different, a “dream” to use Ancelotti’s admiring words on the eve of the first derby of his second spell. “God willing, I’d be here 14 years like he has been at Atlético,” he said, the smile showing that he knows that isn’t going to happen. But then Ancelotti didn’t think this would happen, either. A phone call in the summer about possible player signings ended up with his. “A fantastic surprise,” as he put it in Corriere dello Sport. “There is no better place in the world to live or work.” No better place for a derby either. An unexpected second opportunity, a return to a place he missed and thought left behind was a chance for the Italian to enjoy it for as long as it lasts, every day a bonus. While Ancelotti says that defeats hurt him physically, leaving him unable to sleep, he is a man at ease, beyond all the nonsense and the noise now. “I’m in a phase of my life when I just want to be at peace with the world,” he said. “I have been in football since 1977, almost 46 years, 30 of them coaching. I don’t have the time or the desire to fight. When Florentino [Pérez] wants to sack me, I won’t get angry.” There has been comfort in the familiarity, but maybe not this time as he looks to his right, towards the visitor’s technical area. “What Simeone has done at Atlético – build something important, put the club among the best in Europe, fighting every year, winning titles, and still doing so in an impeccable manner – is something that all coaches want,” Ancelotti said. “To be at a club a long time, leave your mark, your signature on it, that is the dream of all coaches.” He speaks from experience. Simeone left his mark on Ancelotti, too; he is witness to how the revolution at Atlético revived the rivalry, taking it to peaks it may never have reached. As managers they could not be more different, especially not now – at least on the surface. The Argentinian leaps, paces and shouts, waving frantically, conducting the crowd, never still on the touchline right up to the moment when he turns and sprints down the tunnel. The Italian rarely does more than tip chewing gum down his throat and raise an eye brow. Between them, though, they have raised hell, engaging in the biggest battles. Ancelotti was only at Madrid for two seasons but he faced Simeone in 13 derbies, including a Copa del Rey semi-final and the first European Cup final between two teams from the same city, 70,000 fans heading west down the Badajoz road to Lisbon. No game was played more often, nor mattered as much. None felt so momentous, not even the clásicos. The derby had probably never been this competitive and they were not always nice, either. “What a horrible team they are,” one member of Madrid’s backroom staff said as he departed the Calderón defeated one night. They knew they were in a proper fight. Ancelotti saw Atlético win the league – their first in 14 years, only second in 38 – perhaps the most unlikely there has ever been, a genuine overturning of the status quo, and maybe Atlético’s greatest success. If only because exactly seven days later, a Sergio Ramos goal on 92.48, denied them the European Cup and gave Madrid their 10th, an obsession. Without it, Ancelotti might have been dismissed; instead, he will always be the coach that won the décima. In his time there, he suffered a 4-0 defeat, and didn’t win in the league. Victory here would not only be his first derby success in La Liga; it would also take a huge step towards taking this season’s title. And that would be Ancelotti’s first in Spain to go with those won in England, France, Italy and Germany. The position could hardly be better, far more so than anyone anticipated when he arrived as a popular, steady and comfortable if improvised choice of coach, a man with a calm class about everything he does and says. Including refusing to say it’s over, the respect for his rival too great, for the familiar face leading them. Madrid have everyone available, Karim Benzema back after injury, they have gone nine without defeat. But Ancelotti insisted: “What I can say is what has happened – we have done better than the other teams – but that’s talking about the past. If the league ends today, it is over. Sadly, it doesn’t end today: we have to play six more months and I don’t know what can happen next.” He added: “Half a league title? I don’t know. We would have three more points over a rival that will be fighting for the league they won last season. But I don’t want to put more pressure on this game because it the pressure is already there – and that’s a good thing. They have many players I like. Griezmann, Suárez is a fantastic striker. Rodrigo de Paul has played very well. At the back they have ‘pessimistic’ players, and I like that in defenders. They have a great goalkeeper. “They’re a complete team. It will be a game that’s naturally competitive, with duels, against a team fighting for the same objective as us.”",Sport/Football,Title-chasing Carlo Ancelotti faces familiar obstacle in Diego Simeone | Sid Lowe,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/11/title-chasing-carlo-ancelotti-faces-familiar-obstacle-in-diego-simeone
12/12/2021,"Labour surged into a commanding nine-point lead over the Tories this weekend as controversies over rule-breaking Christmas parties at Downing Street and Tory sleaze plunged Boris Johnson into a battle to save his premiership. The latest Opinium poll for the Observer also shows 57% of voters think Johnson should now resign, up nine points from a fortnight ago, as the prime minster appears to be haemorrhaging public support.  Johnson’s personal ratings have fallen to -35%, down 14 points from what was already a record low of -21% two weeks ago. Asked which of three Covid-19 related scandals had shocked them more – the No 10 staff Christmas party last year, the Dominic Cummings trip to Barnard Castle or the Matt Hancock/Gina Coladangelo affair, the Downing Street party comfortably topped the list. Fifty-one percent of people polled said they found that event most shocking, following by 28% for the Cummings trip and 21% for the Hancock controversy. Adam Drummond of Opinium said the fall was “devastating” and noted that high numbers of Conservatives had moved to the undecided column. While he said Johnson was known for comebacks and Labour was by no means free of problems of its own, Drummond added that “unless the Conservatives can turn these numbers around quickly, backbenchers might start asking if the party is over for the prime minister”. The poll puts Labour on 41%, with its nine-point lead being the biggest Opinium has recorded since 2014. The Tories are now on 32%, their lowest score since 2019, while the Liberal Democrats are on 9% (+1), the SNP 5% (unchanged) and the Greens 5% (-1). The findings are likely to increase anger within the Conservative party over last week’s revelations about parties at No 10, which followed weeks of denials by Downing Street, and also follow suggestions that Johnson misled his own standards adviser, Lord Geidt, over the arrangements for the refurbishment of his Downing Street flat. Opinium found that 60% of people now believe the UK will go into another lockdown in the next three months. The controversies reached new heights in an extraordinary week for the prime minister, during which his wife, Carrie, gave birth to their second child, and he was confronted by intense anger from his backbenchers over new Covid restrictions aimed at holding back the spread of the Omicron variant. Johnson is facing a potentially damaging rebellion by his own MPs on Tuesday, when the measures will be voted on in parliament. Then on Thursday he is facing the prospect of possible defeat at the hands of the Liberal Democrats in the normally rock-solid Tory seat of North Shropshire in a byelection caused by the resignation of Owen Paterson, who was found to have broken parliamentary lobbying rules. A memo to staff from the Liberal Democrat high command on Friday revealed that according to responses it had reviewed from voters who intend to cast a ballot on Thursday, the Tories – who enjoyed a 23,000 majority at the last election – now have a lead of just one point. The Lib Dem projection puts the Tories on 40%, the Lib Dems on 39% and Labour on 12%, with Reform UK and the Greens on 4% each. Defeat in the seat would trigger something close to panic among Tory MPs, who only six months ago were mostly willing to stand by Johnson despite the controversies that follow him, because they saw him as a winner with the public. For much of October, and following the conference season, Johnson’s party enjoyed a lead of four or five points in Opinium’s survey. Since then the collapse has caused serious alarm at all levels of the party. Asked about the prospect of a Tory rebellion on Tuesday, communities secretary Michael Gove said he was confident MPs would examine proposals for new restrictions “seriously, soberly and thoughtfully” in light of the way Omicron had been spreading across the UK. Johnson’s critics on the backbenches say they expect several disgruntled MPs to send letters of no confidence to the backbench 1922 committee chairman, Sir Graham Brady, in the coming days, unless the prime minister can rapidly steady the ship.",News/Politics,Labour races to nine-point lead in polls in wake of sleaze controversies at No 10,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/dec/11/labour-races-to-nine-point-lead-in-polls-in-wake-of-sleaze-controversies-at-no-10
12/12/2021,"Some at Anfield rose to their feet to applaud a returning figure from their past. Danny Ings was back and he was coming off the bench. Meanwhile, Steven Gerrard grimaced in his distinctly damp vigil in the technical area. He has scripted some of the more improbable tales in 21st century football through sheer willpower but a man whose Liverpool career ended amid the humiliation and farce of a 6-1 thrashing at Stoke knows special occasions do not always go as planned. This didn’t. Not for Gerrard, though his Aston Villa side proved awkward opponents in defeat. Nor, perhaps, for the Liverpool public. Had Villa been vanquished, they could have devoted more time to serenading Gerrard. Instead, Villa’s obduracy afforded little time for sentimentality. When some in the Kop started to revive an old chorus saluting Gerrard in the opening minutes, they were drowned out by a rendition of “Liverpool”. They have still spent longer singing “Ole’s at the wheel” than Gerrard’s name this season.  And so he lingered, seen but not celebrated, until the Villa supporters chanted his name, finding proof in a committed display that his first return to Liverpool had not been clouded by sentimentality. It was only with the release of the final whistle that his name echoed around Anfield again; for a decade and a half, it was a song that carried the threat that, whatever the other 21 players on the pitch did, Steven Gerrard would win the game for Liverpool. His reputation has been maintained. Now that talismanic status has been passed on, to the matchwinner Mohamed Salah and to the catalytic Jürgen Klopp. Liverpool’s fondness for nostalgia has not stopped them from savouring the present and Gerrard had gone down the tunnel before a fist-pumping Klopp played to the gallery in the Kop. “I did not feel under pressure today,” grinned Klopp. “There is one person it was not easy for and that is Stevie.” Gerrard lost a game but passed a test. He avoided the trap Gérard Houllier fell into. Gerrard’s mentor erred on his Anfield comeback by acknowledging the Kop, but not the Villa fans, in a telling indication of where his affections still lay. Houllier perhaps never regained his standing with the Villa supporters. The man he made captain at 23 showed more pragmatism and less mawkishness, applauding the travelling hordes from the Midlands before waving to those who idolised him and hugging Klopp, who has tipped Gerrard to succeed him. Gerrard projected a purposeful air. So did his team. Think of Gerrard the player and the adventurer or the escapologist spring to mind. Perhaps a dozen years under Houllier and Rafa Benítez have made him a defensive strategist as a manager. He completed a Scottish Premiership season with Rangers conceding a mere 13 goals. The finest Liverpool team he played in, the class of 2008-09, were denied the title in part because of Anfield stalemates and, for an hour, this threatened to be another as Villa resisted. Gerrard’s side have got his combative instincts. Their streetwise streak irritated Klopp. “Nothing will come between him and me but we are both focused,” he said. “You can be best friends with someone and want to beat them. It is the same with me and David Wagner.” He spent much of the first half in constant communication with the fourth official, seemingly about Emi Martínez’s serial timewasting. Presumably the goalkeeper was only following his manager’s orders, but it brought the Argentinian unpopularity at Anfield. Ings, scorer of four Liverpool goals in an injury-hit spell, some 182 fewer than Gerrard, was saluted. Then, eventually, so was Gerrard. “There is a lot of emotion for me and my family,” he said. “I had to try and deal with it the best I could. I am respectful and thankful for the reception I got. I gave many years to this club.” He gave them when he could have joined Real Madrid instead. In the process, perhaps he cemented his legend. For Gerrard, staring over towards the Sir Kenny Dalglish Stand, Liverpool’s past remains the constant reference point. There were banners on the Kop celebrating one of Liverpool’s highest scorers and a European Cup winner, the late Roger Hunt and Ray Kennedy respectively. In years to come, they will almost certainly be joined by images of Gerrard. But for now perhaps their finest ever player will have to wait a little longer to get one over his former club. There is a Villa manager who has beaten Liverpool 7-2 in the recent past, but it is Dean Smith. Gerrard nevertheless gave the sense he is a coach of some stature, without denting Liverpool’s title push. The hero of Istanbul was a Villan but not a villain. He played 710 games for Liverpool and has now managed one against them. For him, this was Anfield.",Sport/Football,Gerrard passes the Anfield test as Liverpool love-in is made to wait | Richard Jolly,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2021/dec/11/gerrard-passes-the-anfield-test-as-liverpool-love-in-is-made-to-wait
12/12/2021,"It was not pretty. It was only just effective. It was Cristiano Ronaldo. Ralf Rangnick’s temporary tenure continued in the right vein points wise, but the performance at a sodden Carrow Road posed more questions than answers. Yes, they dominated possession. But until Ronaldo’s late penalty, it was depleted Norwich - bottom of the table – who pressed more effectively, who looked sharper, who looked perhaps the likelier of victors. Plenty of training ground work to do.  Dean Smith will take pride in the performance but an inability to score continues to hamper them. Ten times now they’ve failed to net in the Premier League this season. Interim manager Rangnick’s expected reversion to the side that started United’s previous two league fixtures came to pass, meaning the entire midweek European XI stood aside. Ronaldo graced Carrow Road some 6,090 days after his previous outing. Norwich’s already daunting task was made harder by a series of absentees. Five changes in total, of which three were enforced. All of those came to the division’s most porous defence, with the ineligible Brandon Williams joined in the stands by centre-back duo Ben Gibson and Andrew Omobamidele. Five at the back became four, and in came Ozan Kabak and Dimitris Giannoulis. Przemyslaw Placheta and Joshua Sargent were both included as pacy attacking outlets. The answer to how one solves a problem like no Emiliano Buendía is, seemingly, still not Todd Cantwell. If United’s start against Crystal Palace last week was Oxford Circus at rush hour, the opening here was more mid-morning at Cromer. And that suited Smith just fine. Too many sloppy touches from those in red, including one that allowed Teemu Pukki to burst down the right and win an early corner. Up went the volume. The visitors almost took the lead with their first meaningful opportunity. Grant Hanley was penalised for a foul that was, let’s say, soft, on Marcus Rashford. From the right-hand edge of the penalty area, Telles completed his ball kissing ritual (it supposedly energises the leather) before clipping a free-kick on to the bar via Sargent. Tim Krul may have got the faintest of touches but not more than the asteroid that supposedly brushed the earth mid-afternoon. The half’s biggest roar came when Ronaldo attempted an audacious left-foot volley, only to completely miss his kick. That noise was matched when he subsequently fouled Hanley in a failed attempt to save face. But it came at a cost. Hanley – a man mountain of a defender – lay crumpled. He tried to run it off but lasted just a few minutes more. On came utility man Jacob Sørensen, slotting into an already depleted defence. Not that the Dane was fazed; faced with a series of circa-2005 stepovers from Ronaldo, he simply watched, waited and nipped the ball away. United continued to dominate possession, Bruno Fernandes yearning to make things happen; largely though, he found touch. Ronaldo twisted and turned to get a left-foot effort away that Krul parried, before, on the stroke of the interval, Krul scrambled backward to tip over Harry Maguire’s looping header. For all the talk of McFred, Lukas Rupp was the standout midfielder, a constant disruptor for Norwich. He had their best chance of the half too, mistiming his jump and heading Sørensen’s cross tamely at David de Gea. East Anglian belief, though, was growing. And by osmosis that transferred to those in yellow. Immediately after the restart, Placheta – who, along with Max Aarons, the last-man standing from Smith’s first choice backline, was giving Telles plenty of discomfort down the right – shot straight at De Gea after wriggling his way into the box. Rangnick, sporting a red baseball cap to shield him from the unrelenting rain, stood poker-faced on the touchline. That served only to expose him to the ever-increasing decibel level. Every home tackle, every interception was greeted as a goal. Those have been rare for Norwich this season but a rasping 18-yard left-foot effort from Pukki, who found his feet after being fed by Rupp, almost brought one. At full-stretch, De Gea pulled off a magnificent one-handed stop. Then came the heartbreak. Scott McTominay clipped cross saw Ronaldo – who else – go down, Aarons’ arm around his neck. Darren England pointed to the spot and the penalty winner, turned penalty scorer. Emphatic. Norwich almost responded immediately, De Gea again forced into action by Kabak’s header. Ronaldo scooped over from close range but still, Norwich came, Billy Gilmour saw back-to-back efforts blocked before Kabak was denied again in injury-time.
