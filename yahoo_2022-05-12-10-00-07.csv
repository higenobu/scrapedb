Teacher and TikToker @jmac8781 learned that the handles in the back seat of her car were more functional than she thought. Apparently, the spring-loaded handles for passengers to pull down and hold don’t always need to be pulled. The little-known hack was popularized in a video by @sanne_vberkel. When the teacher saw the tutorial, she was eager to try it herself. Tess Holliday talks Dior, Chanel and Britney Spears while going on a luxury shopping spree: In the funny video, @jmac8781 watched the hack, then rushed out of her condo to test it out. She busted out of her door, into the elevator and down to the parking lot. The teacher located her car handle and flipped down a tiny flap that released the handle and held it in place. In the comment section, she explained, “Mine were hidden, and I had to use my keys to pop them out.” The car hack received 1.5 million views on TikTok. “Those are really meant to cover the fasteners that attach the handle to the vehicle,” a person suggested. “Why don’t these things come with instructions!!!!!!!!

5/12/2022,"Markets have well and truly changed direction from last year’s bullish trends. The downward shift has brought us a major selloff, and declines of 27% and more in the tech-heavy NASDAQ index. For investors, it’s a situation that requires a close watch on the markets, and clear eye for the opportunities that will pop out as conditions change. It’s also a situation in which investors can use expert advice. Jim Cramer, the well-known host of CNBC’s ‘Mad Money’ program, tells investors that when the market starts to change direction, in response to shifting trends or increased volatility, it’s also time to change strategies. And in the current clime, Cramer is recommending profitable stocks in the tech sector – especially those that are beaten-down. Describing his stance, Cramer says, ""Many tech companies that make real things and return capital to shareholders now do sell at reasonable prices after the tsunami of selling... Right now the facts are a lot less hostile to the beaten-down high-flyers..."" With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to pinpoint two heavily discounted tech stocks that return capital regularly through dividends. Each is a Strong Buy, according to the analyst community, and has a strong upside potential for the coming year. Let's take a closer look. Absolute Software (ABST) First up is Absolute Software, a leader in enterprise resilience, or maintaining normal operations, along with the ability to recover systems and data, against network security breaches. The Canadian-based company's product lines offer customers the ability to manage, control, and heal devices, networks, data, and operations, shortening recovery times and speeding up the return to normalcy. In addition, Absolute offers IT and security solutions to protect systems and prevent breaches from occurring. Absolute boasts over 13,000 global customers, including 28 OEMs who factory-embed Absolute products into devices. The company also has 140 patents to protect its intellectual property. More importantly, however, the move toward remote work in the last two years has put a high premium on networking and network security – a move that has benefited Absolute. The company’s revenues started taking off in the past year, and in the most recent quarter, Q3 of fiscal year 2022 (the quarter ending March 31), the company reported $52 million at the top line, up 69% year-over-year. The high revenue was supported by an 18% acceleration in annual recurring revenue, which broke above $200 million in the quarter. Quarterly cash from operations grew by $7.3 million to reach a company record of $17 million. Also of note to investors, the company declared a dividend of 8 cents Canadian per common share for the quarter. At a rate of 6 cents US, the dividend annualizes to 24 cents and gives a yield of 3.3%. Absolute has maintained its dividend for the past 9 years. Despite these positive drivers, Absolute’s shares are down 51% over the past 12 months. That has not, however, dissuaded Canaccord's 5-star analyst Michael Walkley from take a bullish view of the stock. “We believe Absolute has a unique technology moat – an embedded software in the firmware of 500M+ PCs by OEM partners – and the ability to drive towards 20%+ long-term growth in a large and growing TAM, while maintaining its rule of 40 metrics. Further, enterprise / government computers typically run an average of 10+ security apps, which Absolute’s resilience offering can ensure are correctly installed and working properly... management is executing well and the share price represents a very attractive entry point. We believe patient long-term investors are likely to be rewarded,"" Walkley opined. These bullish comments support Walkley’s Buy rating on ABST shares, and his $17 price target implies an upside of ~134% for the coming year. (To watch Walkley’s track record, click here) Walkley may be particularly bullish here, but he is not the only analyst positive on Absolute Software. The stock’s 4 recent reviews break down to 3 Buys and 1 Hold, for a Strong Buy consensus view, and the $13.56 average price target suggests an 87% one-year upside from the current trading price of $7.25. (See ABST stock forecast on TipRanks) National Instruments (NATI) Now we’ll turn to National Instruments, a Texas-based company that offers a wide range of tech products, including automated test equipment and virtual instrumentation software. The company’s products give solutions for a series of tech-related issues, including prototype design and validation, and factory device testing. National Instrument’s product line has found applications as varied as semiconductors and electronics to transportation to aerospace and defense. National Instruments has been making strong moves to expand its footprint in recent months. This past March, the company completed its purchase, for an undisclosed amount, of the Electronic Vehicle segment of the German firm Heinzinger GmbH. Heinzinger is a leader in Europe’s high-current and high-voltage power systems. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash and credit. In another acquisition, this May, National Instruments closed its transaction with Kratzer Automation AG. Kratzer provides customer solutions in the EV market, and this acquisition further expands NI’s footprint in the EV market, a growing segment in modern manufacturing. In the first quarter of the year, NI reported 1Q22 revenue of $385 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, but below the $402 million estimates. Product orders were up in the quarter, increasing by 27% over the year-ago period. The company reported positive non-GAAP diluted earnings of 41 cents per share, just missing the 43-cent forecast – but increasing 28% from the same metric in 1Q21. NI ended the first quarter with $143 million in cash on hand. This was more than enough to support a dividend of 28 cents per common share. At current share pricing, this dividend yields 3.5%. Even though this stock is feeling pressure right now (down 25% year-to-date), Morgan Stanley's Meta Marshall remains optimistic. The analyst writes, “While we acknowledge a relatively disappointing Q1 result for NATI on greater than expected supply chain challenges / Russia exposure, we view dip as a buying opportunity for the name given operating leverage potential and growing exposures to key megatrends. We remain cognizant that achievement of price target will require NATI to move past supply chain issues and investors gaining greater confidence in ability to measure impact, but think lead times remain competitive (7-8 weeks vs. competitors at 14-16 weeks for some areas)” In line with this bullish outlook, Marshall rates NATI shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), with a $44 price target that indicates room for 39% growth in the next 12 months. (To watch Marshall’s track record, click here) Once again, we’re looking at a stock with 4 recent stock reviews, including 3 Buys against 1 Hold, and a Strong Buy consensus rating. NATI is trading for $31.65 and its $46.50 average target suggests ~47% upside from that level.

5/12/2022,"A former Korean YouTuber and pharmacist was sentenced to jail for knowingly spreading a sexually transmitted disease.

Park Seung-jong, who went by the name “Yakult,” was charged with injury and violation of the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act and sentenced to eight months in prison and two years of probation.

He was found guilty of knowingly spreading the herpes type 2 virus infection to various women.

“As the accused is a pharmacist, it is established that his actions were deliberate,” Judge Kim Min Joo of the Uijeongbu District Court, said. “As the accused had the Herpes 2 virus, and the victims showed early signs of the virus, it is impossible to deny the relation.”

The former YouTuber and pharmacist broadcaster rose to fame after appearing in entertainment programs, including MBC’s “My Little Television” in 2019.

Park was first accused in 2020 when a victim claimed that he disregarded her wish to use protection during sexual intercourse. She sued Park in June that year.

“Yakult ignored my wish to use a condom,” the victim reportedly said. “After having sex with him, I went to the hospital, as I was not feeling well and was diagnosed with herpes 2.”

The victim told her story online, and, since then, Park has disappeared from the public eye.

5/12/2022,"Whether you’re the queen of England or a newborn baby, everyone pees. The average person flushes five to six times a day, but urine is not something most people typically keep a close eye on — unless they suddenly notice an unusual color in the toilet. Despite what you might have heard, clear urine is not the only hallmark of good health. A range of colors is acceptable. Urine is made up of excess water, electrolyte salts and other waste. The kidneys produce urine, which finds its way into the bladder and is later excreted. The bladder fills up, and eventually reaches a point when it can’t hold anymore, which causes the sensation that informs you that you must make a visit to the bathroom. This process is necessary because it’s harmful to have too much water in your system. Dr. Mark Ellerkmann, director of the Center for Urogynecology at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, tells Yahoo Life that toxins in the body and bloodstream need to be eliminated. As the kidneys filter the blood, they remove toxins and extra water to make urine. Of course, if your pee is coming out a blood orange color, it’s normal to be concerned. Some health conditions can change the color of urine. Fortunately, experts say, there are also many nonmedical reasons for such changes. Ellerkmann says that the shade can depend on urine concentration, which influences a natural pigment called urochrome. When the urine is more concentrated (with less water and more waste product), it’s darker. When you’re hydrated, the urine is less concentrated and you have a clear or light color. Other things, for example, your medication, your diet and any infections you may experience, can cause the urine to change color. “Your color can vary depending on your hydration status. Any transient changes in urine color should not alarm you,” Ellerkmann says. The color of your urine can serve as a window to your health. If your urine is yellow… If you’re well-hydrated, your urine will probably be a clear or light yellow. Ellerkmann explains that this has to do with maintaining a balance of fluids as the kidneys eliminate excess fluid in the body. “We don’t want to become dehydrated, but we also don’t want to become over-hydrated,” he says. “This whole concept of homeostasis and fluid management is something the kidneys handle.” When a person is getting enough water, the kidney flushes out the excess, leaving a clear, lighter color. With dehydration, the kidney holds on to the fluids, and the urine is darker. “Generally, I tell patients to drink enough water to keep their urine light yellow, but that amount can be different for everybody,” Dr. Jason Kim, associate professor of urology at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University and director of the Women's Pelvic Health and Continence Center at Stony Brook Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. If your urine is orange… One of the most common explanations for orange urine is medication. Kim explains that pyridium is frequently prescribed for urinary tract infections (UTIs), and that one of its side effects is that it turns urine a reddish-orange. This is a sign that the medicine is doing its job, and the color will go away once you stop taking the medication. Some laxatives and certain chemotherapy drugs have the same effect. Kim says taking high amounts of vitamin also produce a bright yellow or orange urine. These vitamins, such as riboflavin, are water-soluble and not completely absorbed by the body. When there is too much vitamin B, the kidneys filter and remove the excess, resulting in a lot of bright yellow to orange urine. Another nutrient responsible for orange urine is beta carotene, the pigment that gives carrots its orange color. If your urine has a blue or green tint… Kim says medications including some anesthetics, such as propofol, have occasionally turned urine blue. For those undergoing a procedure or medical intervention, doctors can sometimes use certain dyes that can make the urine look blue. Eating foods with strong food coloring dyes can also cause urine to turn a shade of blue or green. If your urine is brown… If you're dehydrated, your urine may have a brown hue to it. Kim says dark brown urine indicates you're not drinking enough fluids, because your urine is too concentrated. But if you’re chugging water regularly, Ellerkmann says one reason for brown urine is that you’ve recently eaten some blackberries. If that’s the case, he says the urine color change is harmless and probably means you have just eaten a lot of the fruit in a short time. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, some liver and kidney disorders, as well as some urinary tract infections, can turn urine dark brown and warrant a doctor’s visit. If your urine is cloudy… Cloudy urine and a burning sensation or difficulty urinating can be a sign of a urinary tract infection. Kim says it’s important to see your doctor for a workup and get the right antibiotics for quick relief. If your urine is dark or red… While reddish pee can be due to eating certain types of produce — “some vegetables with vitamin B, rhubarb or beets can cause red urine,” notes Kim — a dark hue may represent blood in the urine, also called hematuria. Ellerkmann says this can be caused by several conditions involving the bladder and kidneys. “If it has more of a coffee grounds appearance, that would be very concerning,” he says. It can be a sign of blood in the urine from kidney stones, kidney cancer or bladder cancer. One indicator that dark urine is from blood, says Ellerkmann, is if it continues to show up for several days. “Persistent bright-red blood, bloody urine or very dark-colored urine should be evaluated,” he says. Blood in the urine is never normal and can signal a serious medical condition that should alert you to see your health care provider or a urologist immediately. A range of health problems involves blood in the urine, including: Kidney stones Cancer Urinary tract infection Kidney disease Bladder disease “The American Medical Association recommends a workup if there's blood in the urine, and this would include specialized urine tests, along with some sort of imaging tests such as a CAT [computerized tomography] scan and a cystoscopy,” Kim explains. The majority of Americans are full of it, according to new research. Seven in 10 Americans are holding their poop in all to avoid using a public restroom. A new survey of 2,000 general population Americans asked about their pooping preferences and found 69% hate pooping in public so much, they hold it in until they can be in the comfort of their own home.Men were also more likely to agree with this mindset, at 74% compared to 65% of women surveyed.On average, Americans are holding it in for two and half hours in order to poop at home – and men are willing to wait three hours, compared to two hours for women.Why are people putting themselves through this discomfort? The survey found 64% of respondents agreed they’re just uncomfortable with using a public restroom for No. 2.Conducted by OnePoll on behalf of MiraLAX, the survey asked respondents what the most important points of public restroom etiquette are and found peeping through the gaps in the doors is the biggest violation (48%).Forty-six percent of those surveyed who are uncomfortable with using a public restroom shared it’s because they don’t want anyone hearing them do their business.An additional 44% said they’re uncomfortable pooping in a strange or unknown environment and three in 10 are a little pee shy, citing they don’t like going to the bathroom around other people.The survey also delved into the role pooping plays in the workplace – and the separate set of anxieties that come with the territory. As many Americans return to the office for the first time in months, one in five American office workers cited having to use the office bathroom as a prime reason they are stressed about the return to the office amid the pandemic.Of those surveyed who are employed (approximately 1,300 respondents), 71% agreed they have a special bathroom they specifically use for #2 at work.Moreover, 66% of American workers admit to holding it in to avoid using their workplace restroom. As a result, this has caused a staggering 64% of workers to become constipated.As more and more workers return to their offices and are forced to revisit pre-pandemic bathroom habits, workstipation, the stress associated with “going” at the office resulting in a backed-up gut, is likely to rear its ugly head,” said David Ball, General Manager and Vice President Marketing – Digestive Health at Bayer. “With so many workplace bathrooms considered uncomfortable, it is important Americans are armed with effective solutions when constipation arises to aid in helping them go comfortably.”Aside from the toilet paper and bad smells, other workplace bathroom pet peeves for employed respondents included coworkers trying to talk to them while they’re in a stall (36%) and witnessing co-workers walk out without washing their hands (31%).Seven in 10 employed respondents shared they feel self-conscious about pooping at work – with the top reasons including fearing they use the restroom longer than others (50%) and, in turn, having their co-workers judge them for taking too long (40%).“Americans deserve to feel comfortable when it comes to pooping at work, in spite of the many reasons workplace bathrooms can be a less-than-ideal experience, as avoiding going can cause much discomfort,” Ball continued. PUBLIC RESTROOM ETIQUETTEDon’t look through gaps in the doors - 48%Don’t talk, especially to someone who’s urinating/defecating - 46%Keep one stall/urinal between you and the next person - 40%Avoid making unnecessary noises - 39%Avoid eye contact - 32%Leave as quickly as possible - 32%Avoid making or taking phone calls - 32%TOP WORKPLACE BATHROOM PET PEEVESThin toilet paper - 44%Bad smells - 43%Gaps in bathroom stalls - 37%Coworkers trying to speak to you while you are in a stall - 36%Hearing sounds coming from other stalls - 34%Coworkers that don’t wash their hands - 31%When coworkers are in the bathroom and you need to poop - 22%Coworkers gathering and talking - 12% Want lifestyle and wellness news delivered to your inbox?

5/12/2022,"The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has banned Adidas' sports bra ads featuring bare breasts. Some complainants told the ASA that the ads ""objectified women"" and reduced them to body parts. Adidas had released the ads to highlight the diversity of breasts and promote its sports bra range. The UK has banned a series of adverts for Adidas sports bras that featured bare breasts. In complaints to the UK's Advertising Standards Authority, some people said that the adverts objectified and sexualized women and were inappropriate for children. Adidas released the ad campaign in February, which included both social-media posts and posters featuring images of a variety of exposed breasts, in some cases with the nipples blurred out. The campaign was released to highlight the uniqueness and diversity of breasts and promote the 72 sizes included in Adidas' sports bra range, the company said. The posters were accompanied by text reading: ""The reasons we didn't make just one new sports bra."" Posts on Instagram and Twitter had longer captions with a similar sentiment. But the campaign sparked controversy online, with some social-media users describing the image as ""distasteful"" and ""explicit."" The ASA said it received 24 complaints about the campaign. Some said that the ads may have been ""harmful and offensive"" because they ""objectified women by sexualizing them and reducing them to body parts,"" per the ASA. Complainants also questioned whether the posters, which were displayed in public places, were appropriate for children. Some social-media users have lauded Adidas for the campaign, however, commenting on the Instagram post with heart and clapping emojis. ""Thank you for showing more brown breasts than the average health textbook!"" one comment reads. ""Although we did not consider that the way the women were portrayed was sexually explicit or objectified them, we considered that the depiction of naked breasts was likely to be seen as explicit nudity,"" the ASA said Wednesday. ""We noted the breasts were the main focus in the ads, and there was less emphasis on the bras themselves, which were only referred to in the accompanying text."" The ASA said that that because the posters contained explicit nudity and were displayed in places where they were likely to be seen by children, they were ""inappropriately targeted, and were likely to cause widespread offence."" The tweet featuring the image was ""not in keeping with their usual content"" and was therefore ""likely to cause widespread offence,"" the ASA said. ""The ads must not appear again in the forms complained of,"" the ASA said. ""We told Adidas UK Ltd to ensure their ads did not cause offence and were targeted responsibly."" Adidas told Insider: ""The gallery creative was designed to show just how diverse breasts are, featuring different shapes and sizes that highlight why tailored support is paramount."" ""It is important to note that the ASA ruling was related to this creative being used in an untargeted fashion rather than the creative itself and the message, which we stand proudly behind,"" the company added. The ASA said that Adidas UK had released the images to ""reflect and celebrate different shapes and sizes, illustrate diversity, and demonstrate why tailored support bras were important"" and hasn't considered the ads as sexual. Adidas told the ASA that it had submitted the ads to the Committees of Advertising Practice, who had said the images weren't sexual but that the use of nudity brought risk. As a result, Adidas didn't place the ads near schools or religious venues, it said.

5/12/2022,"NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE, France (Reuters) - The Russian military's failure to seize the Ukrainian capital was inevitable because in the preceding years they had never directly faced a powerful enemy, according to a former mercenary with the Kremlin-linked Wagner Group who fought alongside the Russian army. Marat Gabidullin took part in Wagner Group missions on the Kremlin's behalf in Syria and in a previous conflict in Ukraine, before deciding to go public about his experience inside the secretive private military company. He quit the Wagner group in 2019, but several months before Russia launched the invasion on Feb. 24 Gabidullin, 55, said he received a call from a recruiter who invited him to go back to fighting as a mercenary in Ukraine. He refused, in part because, he said, he knew Russian forces were not up to the job, even though they trumpeted their arsenal of new weapons and their successes in Syria where they helped President Bashar al-Assad defeat an armed rebellion. ""They were caught completely by surprise that the Ukrainian army resisted so fiercely and that they faced the actual army,"" Gabidullin said about Russia's setbacks in Ukraine. He said people he spoke to on the Russian side had told him they expected to face rag-tag militias when they invaded Ukraine, not well-drilled regular troops. ""I told them: 'Guys, that's a mistake',"" said Gabidullin, who is now in France where he is publishing a book about his experiences fighting with the Wagner Group. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he did not know who Gabidullin was and whether he has ever been a member of private military companies. ""We, the state, the government, the Kremlin can not have anything to do with it,"" he said. The Russian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a “special operation” that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy its southern neighbour's military capabilities and capture what it regards as dangerous nationalists. Gabidullin is part of a small but growing cohort of people in Russia with security backgrounds who have supported President Vladimir Putin's foreign incursions but now say the way the war is being conducted is incompetent. Igor Girkin, who helped lead a pro-Kremlin armed revolt in eastern Ukraine in 2014, has been critical of the way this campaign is being conducted. Alexei Alexandrov, an architect of the 2014 rebellion, told Reuters in March the invasion was a mistake. Gabidullin took part in some of the bloodiest Syrian clashes in Deir al-Zor province, in Ghouta and near the ancient city of Palmyra. He was seriously injured in 2016 when a grenade exploded behind his back during a battle in the mountains near Latakia. Gabidullin spent a week in a coma and three months in a hospital where he had surgeries to remove one of his kidneys and some intestines. Reuters has independently verified he was in the Wagner Group and was in combat in Syria. Wagner Group fighters have been accused by rights groups and the Ukrainian government of committing war crimes in Syria and eastern Ukraine from 2014 onwards. Gabidullin said he had never been involved in such abuses. DIFFERENT PROPOSITION Moscow's involvement helped turn the tide of the Syrian war in favour of al-Assad, but Gabidullin said Russia's military restricted itself mainly to attacks from the air, while relying on Wagner mercenaries and other proxies to do the lion's share of the fighting on the ground. The Russian military's task was easier too. Its opponents — Islamic State and other militias — had no anti-aircraft systems or artillery. Fighting Ukraine, he said, was a different proposition. ""I've seen enough of them in Syria... (The Russian military) didn't take part in combat directly,"" he said in an interview in Paris to promote his book, which will be published by French publishing house Michel Lafon this month. ""The military forces .... when it was needed to learn how to fight, did not learn how to fight for real,"" he said. Wagner Group is an informal entity, with — on paper at least — no offices or staff. The U.S. Treasury Department and the European Union have said the Wagner Group is linked to Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin. Prigozhin has denied any such links. Concord Management and Consulting, Prigozhin’s main business, did not respond to a request for comment. President Vladimir Putin has said private military contractors have the right to work and pursue their interests anywhere in the world as long as they do not break Russian law. Putin has said the Wagner Group neither represented the Russian state nor was paid by it. Gabidullin said although he had known the Russian invasion of Ukraine was coming, he did not expect it to be on such a scale. ""I could not even think that Russia will wage a war on Ukraine. How could that be? It's impossible,"" he said.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, said he expects China to produce ""some very strong companies"" because of the country's workforce. ""There's just a lot of super-talented, hardworking people in China who strongly believe in manufacturing,"" Musk said in an interview with the Financial Times on Tuesday.

""This way of working is very harmful for the human body, we've heard a lot of news about deaths from working overtime in recent years, but this deformed overtime system still prevails,"" one blogger wrote at the time. ""We can't help but ask — is it really worth it to exchange our lives for money?"" Musk's recent comments came in response to a question about which electric-vehicle startups impressed him the most, to which he responded that Volkswagen — though far from a startup — was ""doing the most"" on the EV front. Musk later praised the software engineers and technologists on his team, saying that his companies' focus on challenges such as artificial intelligence and spaceflight help him attract top talent. The best minds, he said, are more interested in pushing the bounds of innovation than in getting paid a lot to work on something boring. ""It's not a money thing,"" he added.

5/12/2022,"Anthony Harvey/Getty Images Zara Phythian at the 'Doctor Strange' premiere in 2016. Doctor Strange actress Zara Phythian and her husband, Victor Marke, have been convicted of multiple charges of child sex abuse in a British court. According to a document provided to EW by the Nottingham Crown Court clerk, 37-year-old Phythian — who was tried under the name Zara Marke — was convicted of 14 counts, with her 59-year-old husband convicted of 18. The counts for Phythian all relate to sexual activity with a child that occurred between December 2005 and December 2008. She is named alongside Marke in all of her charges, though he is individually included on four additional indecent assault charges (for actions dating back to September 2002) as an individual. Marke's offenses include indecent assault of a 15-year-old victim, while both were convicted of multiple counts of sexual activity with another underage victim beginning when she was 13. Their actions span multiple years and repeated occasions involving the same victim. Some abuse survivors believe the safety measures mandated by the settlement don't go far enough Phythian has two dozen credits listed on IMDb, the most notable being a small role in the 2016 Doctor Strange blockbuster opposite Benedict Cumberbatch as a ""Brunette Zealot."" She does not appear in the sequel, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Per BBC reporting, Marke claimed that the sexual activity occurred on only one occasion, and that Phythian was not involved alongside him. Phythian reportedly denied any sexual activity with one of the victims. Judge Mark Watson remanded the couple into custody following the trial, ahead of their May 16 sentencing. ""Both of you know the sentence I pass on 16 May is likely to be measured by a considerable period of custody,"" he said at the trial. Nicole Hepburn from the Crown Prosecution Service said that Phythian and Marke were ""exposed as the true liars"" in the case, after the victims initially reported the pair years after the abuse began. ""This abuse may have occurred some years ago, but that makes it no less serious and nor is it a barrier to justice,"" Hepburn continued, according to the BBC.

Unpaid meal breaks vary from state to state. In California, employees must receive a 30-minute meal break for every five hours they work, while in New York, it’s a break for every six hours. And in New York, employees also aren’t allowed to opt out of their lunch breaks and should not do any work during that meal period. The Fair Labor Standards Act, which is the federal wage law, does not require employers to provide meal breaks. Commenters agreed with Jess’s frustration over the situation. “IT’S A SCAM, people.

5/12/2022,"The $13 billion aircraft carrier USS Gerald R Ford is a first-in-class ship and features a suite of new technologies. Former President Donald Trump complained about the ""look"" of the aircraft on numerous occasions, according to his former defense secretary. After cost overruns and delays, the Ford is expected to be ready for naval operations later this year. Former President Donald Trump liked to complain about ""ugly"" ships, and the US Navy's new aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R Ford, was often the target of his criticisms, according to former officials, including his former defense secretary. The $13 billion Ford is a first-in-class ship and is the world's largest aircraft carrier. It features a collection of new technologies, such as advanced weapons elevators, advanced arresting gear, and a electromagnetic aircraft launch system, among other upgrades over the Navy's older Nimitz-class carriers. The former president complained often, both publicly and in private, about the viability of these new systems, insisting that the elevators would stop working if they got a drop of water on them or that the new catapults were too complex compared to the older steam catapults and required Einstein-level intelligence to operate. He thought the ship would ""never work,"" former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper wrote in his new book, ""A Sacred Oath: Memoirs of a Secretary of Defense During Extraordinary Times."" But above all, Esper wrote, Trump was consistently fixated on ""the look"" of the ship, different angles of which can be seen in the following US Navy photos. Esper recalled visiting Norfolk, Virginia with Trump toward the end of his presidency to see off the USNS Comfort. As the former president admired the destroyers and other warships at the pier, he remarked ""how beautiful"" they looked before launching into a tirade complaining about the Ford. ""I had tried multiple times in the past to address these matters, but by now had given up,"" the former Pentagon chief reported. Trump took particular issue with the position of the Ford's command center for flight operations and the ship overall, a structure commonly known as the ""island."" The island is a narrow structure that extends upward from the flight deck. The island ""looks really bad — it's stupid,"" Trump said, according to Esper, adding that the president suggested moving the command center closer to the middle of the ship. ""Imagine the time and cost to do that,"" Esper wrote in his memoir. Esper explained that Trump ""would gesture with his hands, parallel to each other, farther apart, then closer,"" when discussing the island, ""like a football referee measuring the distance in inches or feet to get a first down."" The Ford's design was the product of years of effort. Navy officers tried to explain that the command center was placed there for operational purposes, specifically making it easier to conduct flight operations, but Trump insisted ""it doesn't look right,"" adding that he had ""an eye for aesthetics,"" according to the book ""Peril"" by Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Robert Costa that came out last year. When Trump said he had an ""eye for aesthetics,"" he reportedly rubbed his hands through his own hair and told his audience, which included Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley, ""Can't you tell?"" Despite setbacks over the course of the ship's development, the Ford has gone through explosive shock trials and the necessary maintenance availabilities and should be ready for naval operations sometime this year. Three other Ford-class carriers, the John F. Kennedy, the Enterprise, and the Doris Miller, are in the works.

5/12/2022,"Texas’ murky waterways hide massive beasts, but it takes a rod, fish heads, and a lot of fight to reveal them, video taken by a Houston-area angler shows. Payton Moore, a fisherman and YouTuber, could hardly see through the waves and wake when the alligator gar took his bait. At first he thinks he snagged a sunken tree, he says in a video recently posted on his YouTube channel, WILD LIFE. But then the thing on the hooks starts to wrestle with him. “We are on something enormous,” he says. The muddy river is somewhere “in the greater Houston area,” Moore told McClatchy News, but in the interest of protecting the fish, he declined to reveal anything more about his gar fishing spot. The strength pulling away from Moore hints at what creature he has on the hook. “It’s like walking a T-Rex,” he says. “Every time I think I’m going to muscle him up, he muscles me back down,” Moore says in the video. A rod won’t be enough, he decides. Moore readies a rope lasso as he pulls the gar closer to shore. The fight goes on and the beast breaches the surface. An “absolute dinosaur,” the angler says. While alligator gar might not be literal dinosaurs, they are an extremely old species that existed at the same time as dinosaurs, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. When the moment comes, Moore moves in close, loops the rope around the gar and pulls it in. On shore, he measures the fish at 8 feet, 2 inches long — 3 inches shy of the world record for length. Moore didn’t get the chance to weigh the fish before releasing it back into the river — so there’s no way to know how heavy it was for certain — but he estimates it was about 300 pounds. “This is by far the most amazing catch of my entire life and it’s not even close,” Moore says. “I could fish for the rest of my life and never see one like that again.” With measurements done, Moore carries the gar into the water and back to freedom, video shows. It thrashes out of his hands, easily knocking him over in the process. Catching and releasing is important, Moore wrote on his YouTube page, asking others to do the same, especially for gar. Despite their intimidating name and impressive set of teeth, alligator gar pose no danger to people, according to Texas wildlife experts, and there is no confirmed instance of a gar attacking a person. Their size and appearance make them a prized game fish, TPWD says. But the species has been declining and has even vanished from certain parts of the southern U.S., and overfishing is considered a large contributor. Fortunately however, “Texas populations are still strong,” experts say. With fossil records dating as far back as 215 million years, gar are “truly native Texans,” TPWD said. ‘Diet Coke was spewing everywhere’: Alligator crashes a pre-birthday party in Florida Angler reels in bass with parasitic surprise, Missouri photos show. ‘Lord have mercy’ ‘What the heck is this?’ Ice fisherman reels in rare ‘golden’ fish at Minnesota lake ‘Blue dragons’ appearing on Texas beaches don’t breathe fire, but be careful near them",U.S./Fort Worth Star-Telegram,"‘Like walking a T-Rex.’ Angler uses rod, lasso to reel in huge alligator gar in Texas",https://news.yahoo.com/walking-t-rex-angler-uses-213752282.html

Soldier Volodymyr Demchenko described killing Russian forces during a recent interview with CNN in Novyi Bykiv, a town located in the Chernihiv region and is about 50 miles east of the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. CNN reported that Demchenko was on the drone team that successfully helped to take back Novyi Bykiv from Russian forces.

5/12/2022,"WILSONS, Va. (AP) — Soon after Jim Medeiros bought his 143-acre (58-hectare) cattle and poultry farm in rural Virginia a decade ago, he and his wife were startled by the sounds of 20 hunting dogs barking and howling as they circled their house and chased their chickens. When Medeiros confronted a hunter nearby, the man told him he had permission to hunt on Medeiros’ property. In disbelief, Medeiros called the agency that enforces a state law allowing hunters to retrieve their hunting dogs from private property, even when the property owners object. “He told me, you can't prohibit people from coming onto your land,” recalled Medeiros. He then pointed out that his land was posted with no trespassing signs. “I said, 'You don't understand. My land is posted,'"" Medeiros said. “You don't understand,"" the official responded. “You can't stop them.” After years of putting up with baying dogs and dead chickens, Medeiros and several other property owners are suing the state over its “right to retrieve” law, arguing that allowing hunters to go on their property without permission amounts to an uncompensated taking of their land and violates the state and federal constitutions. A number of states allow hunters to retrieve their dogs without permission from property owners under certain circumstances, such as properties that do not have “no trespassing” signs. But Virginia's law says hunters are allowed to retrieve dogs even when the property owner has specifically denied access. A 2016 report prepared by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, (now the Department of Wildlife Resources), said only one other state, Minnesota, had a similar law. Minnesota's law says a person can enter private land to retrieve a hunting dog without permission of the owner, but cannot have a firearm when doing so and must immediately leave after recovering the dog. Virginia's law prohibits hunters from carrying guns or bows and arrows while retrieving their dogs from private property. It also says hunters must identify themselves when asked by the landowner. If they refuse, they can be charged with a misdemeanor. The Virginia property owners are suing the Department of Wildlife Resources, which enforces the law. They are represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal organization that won a major property rights case at the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The high court found that a California regulation requiring agricultural businesses to allow union organizers onto their property for up to three hours a day, 120 days per year, amounts to the government appropriating “a right of access to private property” and “constitutes a per se physical taking” under the court's precedents. Daniel Woislaw, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, said he believes Virginia's “right to retrieve” law amounts to a similar physical taking of private property. “When Jim has to let deer dogs and deer dog hunters enter his property, and he's not allowed to tell them to stay away, and when they're killing his livestock and disrupting his operations, that's a taking of a valuable property interest,"" Woislaw said. The law itself was first put on the books in 1938, but the tradition of hunting with dogs dates back 400 years to colonial times, said Kirby Burch, a bear hunter who owns eight hunting dogs and is the chief executive officer of the Virginia Hunting Dog Alliance, a political action committee that represents about 90,000 hunters in the state. Burch said most hunters try to be considerate of land owners and quickly retrieve their dogs when they cross onto private property. “A lot a people who move here from other states are offended by the notion of hunting with dogs so when a dog runs across their property, they're offended, and I understand that, but I think the vast majority of hunters with dogs try in every way possible to avoid irritating their neighbors,"" said Burch, 75, who has been hunting with dogs since he was 5. Burch's group estimates that more than half of the 254,000 licensed hunters in Virginia hunt with dogs. The lawsuit asks the court for a judgment declaring that the law takes the plaintiffs' private property without compensation for public use, a violation of the state constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Multiple attempts have been made in the legislature to overturn the law, but none have succeeded. Ryan Brown, executive director of the Department of Wildlife Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Brown said hunters and private landowners have been able to peacefully co-exist for the most part, but as more rural land has been developed and Virginia has become more suburbanized, the  two groups have been at loggerheads over the hunting dog issue. “Both sides of the debate have vested interests, with the hunters being very interested in the protection of their hunting dogs and real property owners being interested in protection of their rights as land owners,” Brown said. “Both sides have been very passionate about their views.”",U.S./Associated Press,Private property owners sue over Virginia's hunting dog law,https://news.yahoo.com/private-property-owners-sue-over-141505922.html
5/12/2022,"Law enforcement officers in Indiana warned each other about the gun Vicky White had in her hand as they discussed how to retrieve her from her flipped vehicle, according to footage of the incident released by the Evansville Police Department on Tuesday. In one video, officers on the scene crouch in the grassy ditch by the overturned Cadillac, minutes after a U.S. Marshal rammed it, ending both a short police chase and White’s 11-day stint on the run with a murder suspect. The 56-year-old assistant director of corrections shot herself “almost instantaneously” before deputies could reach her, Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said at a Tuesday press conference. Vicky is unresponsive but “still breathing” in the footage, according to one officer discussing how to get her out. A suggestion to pop the front windshield off is quickly disregarded. “Anybody got a Hooligan?” someone asks, referencing a Halligan bar, a tool with a pick-end used by officers to force entry. https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2497518180379075 Eventually, the officer is handed the tool. He lowers himself onto his stomach. “I’m gonna go for the gun,” he says, retrieving the gun from White. In the partially censored footage, he then pulls the guard out of the sunroof by her wrists, with other officers helping to drag her onto grass and gravel. First responders then close in to administer first aid. In another video released by Indiana authorities, escaped inmate Casey White, no relation to Vicky, is seen being taken into custody after the chase. Authorities said that Casey had wanted to end his time on the lam with a police shootout, but a U.S. Marshal ramming the couple’s car during the chase swiftly put an end to that plan. After he emerged from the Cadillac uninjured, more than half a dozen officers crowded the 6-foot-9-inch-tall man, handcuffing him on the ground. Casey is marched away as officers continue to swarm the flipped car and surrounding area. The pair originally vanished from their Lauderdale County, Alabama, jail on April 29. On Tuesday, Sheriff Wedding told reporters that the lovebirds had driven to a cheap Indiana motel and holed up, trying to figure out where to go next. Casey, 38, was extradited back to Lauderdale County on Monday. A day later, a judge set a June trial date for his original murder charge—the “brutal” 2015 stabbing of a 58-year-old woman. Vicky was transported to a hospital, where she was declared dead on Monday night, according to police. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said Tuesday that $29,000 had been found in the Whites’ car, along with several wigs and a cache of weapons, including an AR-15 rifle and 9mm handguns. Casey had so far shown “no remorse” over his prison guard lover’s death, Singleton added. Read more at The Daily Beast.

5/12/2022,"The USS Wichita is fighting for her life. Not in combat, but in Congress. The Navy plans to decommission the Wichita a mere three years after it joined the fleet, because it has the naval equivalent of a cranky transmission. The Wichita was built by Lockheed-Martin at a cost of about $360 million. It’s part of the Freedom Class of “littoral combat ships,” built for shallow-water missions where larger warships can’t go. The ships were designed for high speeds and to use “plug and play” modules to accomplish multiple missions, including surface combat, minesweeping and anti-submarine warfare. But problems have surfaced in the complicated propulsion system that meshes power from two gas turbines and two diesel engines to support speeds reaching 45 knots. The anti-sub module also had issues and was canceled in favor of shifting that capability to larger ships. There have been no publicly reported propulsion issues with the Wichita, but problems arose on at least two other Freedom Class vessels and the Navy has determined the design flaw runs throughout the class. Several military-focused publications have reported that the Wichita is on a list of ships that the Navy plans to scrap in its 2023 budget cycle, because retiring them is more cost-effective than repairing them. That would free up roughly $4 billion of funding for more capable warships. But the cost to our civic pride is incalculable. The Wichita is the first ship named after a Kansas city since the nuclear sub USS Topeka was commissioned in 1989. The Wichita flag is the ship’s battle ensign and its motto is “Keeper of the Sea” — a nod to our Keeper of the Plains statue by Blackbear Bosin, the enduring symbol of Wichita pride. The Wichita City Council and Sedgwick County Commission gave $50,000 in local public money — augmented with additional tens of thousands in private donations — to help outfit the ship with amenities for its roughly 100-member crew, including exercise equipment, video games, laptop computers to communicate with families back home, even a barber chair. A large delegation of local officials, business leaders and veterans trekked to Florida for the commissioning ceremonies in January, 2019. Standing on the deck of the ship, then-Mayor Jeff Longwell pledged Wichita’s undying support for the ship and crew. “Our community truly stands ready to adopt this ship, adopt them as our family,” he said. “We’re excited about being a part of them and making sure they have a support network from Wichita, Kansas.” Sen. Jerry Moran, the keynote speaker at the commissioning, tied it to local Kansas values: “People of strength, love of country, people who persevere, people who demonstrate every day hard work,” he said. “I’m confident the crew, the crew of the USS Wichita, will demonstrate those traits regardless of the challenges that lie ahead.” Wichita hosted the commander and a contingent of sailors from the ship at a Navy Days celebration in 2019 and has plans to do it again in September, now that the COVID-19 pandemic has abated. The decision to scrap the Wichita and her sister ships is not yet final. Bloomberg News reported that the Navy is facing pushback from some representatives and senators in congressional hearings scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday. Perhaps the Freedom Class can be saved. The Navy reported four days ago that the Wichita just completed joint exercises with the Dominican Republic’s navy for interdiction of drug smuggling. That makes sense.

5/12/2022,"LONDON — Many observers expected Russia’s air force to blow away Ukraine’s forces in the opening days of the Kremlin’s invasion. Ukraine’s military would be left completely vulnerable as Russian warplanes could pick off targets at whim. But that hasn’t happened. More than two months later, Russia has still not established air supremacy over large swaths of Ukraine, despite having the world’s second-largest air force — and a highly advanced one at that. The New York Times reported Monday that, according to the U.S. Defense Department, Ukraine “continues to fly its own fighters and attack jets against Russian troops.” Russia’s air force has even been timid as Ukraine’s relatively scrappy anti-air defenses remain a formidable threat. NATO countries have done their best to flood Ukraine with man-portable air-defense systems, or MANPADS, like the U.S.-made Stinger missile. The Stinger system can be fired by a single operator, whose missile locks onto aircraft with infrared guidance. “The Western supplies of MANPAD and other types of air defense systems allowed Ukraine to increase and to improve its capabilities,” said Pavel Luzin, a Russian armed forces expert and contributor at the Jamestown Foundation. William Alberque, the director of strategy, technology and arms control at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told Yahoo News that Ukraine was able to effectively distribute these air defenses so it became too dangerous for Russian combat flights. NATO countries have also been providing Ukraine with increasingly advanced military hardware as Russia’s war drags on. Slovakia announced last month that it had donated its Soviet-era S-300 long-range air defense system to Ukraine. Russia has been further hampered by its combat aircrafts’ lackluster weapons systems. U.S. officials say Russian pilots are “unable to quickly locate and engage targets on the ground,” and missiles launched into Ukraine “often miss their targets — if they work at all,” according to the Times. Alberque said Russian stocks of precision-guided munitions are significantly smaller than NATO’s. This observation was backed by security analyst Oliver Alexander, who said on Twitter that with Russia’s lack of precision-guided munitions, “they are forced to use dumb munitions [unguided bombs] to operate at scale.” But technology alone does not fully explain Russia’s failure to establish air superiority. Experts say Russia’s air doctrine has been poorly thought out and haphazardly executed from the opening days of the war. “They thought it would be all over very quickly, with a complete Ukrainian collapse at first contact and [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky either captured or fleeing,” Alberque said. If the Kremlin had predicted Ukrainian resilience, the Russian military would have “done a lot differently and their air power would be far more devastating now,” he said. And because Moscow believed it would capture Ukraine the first few days, Russian military command was keen not to destroy Ukrainian infrastructure it wanted to keep for controlling the country after the war, Alberque said. Phillips Payson O’Brien, a professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, and Edward Stringer, a retired Royal Air Force air marshal, published a Monday essay in the Atlantic delving into the Russian air force’s failures. They argued1 that the Russian military struggles to creatively use air doctrine because it is philosophically wedded to being a traditional land power with massive reserves of soldiers at its disposal. “When the invasion started, the Russian air force was incapable of running a well-thought-out, complex campaign,” they wrote. “Instead of working to control the skies, Russia’s air force has mostly provided air support to ground troops or bombed Ukrainian cities. In this it has followed the traditional tactics of a continental power that privileges land forces.”",World/Yahoo News,Why Russia's air force failed to dominate Ukraine,https://news.yahoo.com/why-russias-air-force-failed-to-dominate-ukraine-135016604.html
5/12/2022,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) published a press release on Monday detailing a brief that he and 84 legislators filed to the Supreme Court that calls for an end to discrimination against Asian American college applicants.

Cruz spearheaded the brief with Korean American Congresswoman Michelle Steel (R, CA-48), who has consistently denounced elite higher education institutions’ admission policies that factor in an applicant’s race to promote campus diversity.

Cruz and Steel rallied the support of 13 Republican Senators, including Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Rand Paul (R-KY), and 70 Republican House Representatives. Steel’s fellow Korean American California representative Young Kim (R, CA-29) was also on the list of signees.

The filing lists “Students for fair admissions” (petitioners) versus the “President and fellows of Harvard College” (respondents) and also the “Students for fair admissions” (petitioners) versus the “University of North Carolina et. al.” (respondents).

The brief begins with the purpose of intent, which states that all members of the Senate and House were committed to the principle of equality under law “as guaranteed” by the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin among other things.

Legislators argued that “no American should be denied educational opportunities because of race,” citing the rejection of Asian American applicants due to their race by Harvard and the University of North Carolina as unconstitutional.

The brief went on to label Asian Americans as victims of discrimination, arguing that race-conscious admissions single out Asian American applicants.

“Race-conscious admissions decisions inflict a heavy toll on Asian-American students. Treating them differently because of their race is a stark departure from equal protection decisions issued early on by this Court, which guarded Asian immigrants from racial prejudice. And the burdens imposed on petitioner illustrate a wider trend. Asian-Americans are increasingly victimized by discriminatory practices.”

The brief also included a petition to overrule Grutter v. Bollinger, the 2003 landmark case in which a white law school applicant, Barbara Grutter, was denied admissions from Michigan Law despite her impressive qualifications, including a 3.8 undergraduate GPA and LSAT score of 161.

The Michigan Law School responded by saying that the race of an applicant was taken into consideration in making its decision to not admit her because it serves a “compelling interest in achieving diversity among its student body.”

The Supreme Court ruled that a university may adopt “narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions to further a compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body.”

The very justification of “racial balancing,” GOP representatives argued, is “an aim that is unconstitutional on its face,” with the Grutter case being a “constitutional outlier.”

They added that race-conscious college admissions, laws and policies should only “survive judicial scrutiny” if “necessary to remedy the effects of an institution’s past discrimination.”

The brief also raised the question of why the protections that originated from the Brown v. Board of Education case should not extend to higher education.

“No one has convincingly explained why dividing schoolchildren by race is unconstitutional while dividing young adults by race is permissible.”

The presence of Asian Americans in the GOP has been on the rise, with the New York state GOP announcing its new Asian American caucus earlier this year and Asian American districts having been found to favor GOP candidates.

If Grutter v. Bollinger is overruled, it might be seen as a big victory for the GOP in demonstrating their support to Asian Americans.

A GOP victory would also mark an end to affirmative action policies that work to increase the enrollment and representation of underrepresented, primarily Black and Hispanic, students.

Kyiv said on Tuesday its forces had successfully pushed Russian troops out of several towns near the city of Kharkiv, part of a counter-offensive that Ukraine hopes could change the course of the war. One soldier here boasted his team could keep delivering these sorts of results. ""The weapons are helping is a lot, the anti-tank ones. I wish the state would supply us with them more frequently. We use the weapons exclusively for specific targets. As you can see we have results. If there are weapons we will have more results."" Kyiv's counter-offensive here could be consequential: Ukrainian forces are moving into striking distance of the supply lines supporting Russia's main attack force in the south, where Moscow has focused on encircling and capturing the Donbass region. Ukrainian forces have so far mostly held out. Despite these setbacks, Russian President Vladimir has showed no signs of calling off or limiting what he's termed a 'special military operation.' U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said on Tuesday she believes Russia still plans for a long war. ""We assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas.

5/12/2022,"(Note profane language in 17th paragraph) By Jonathan Landay VILKHIVKA, Ukraine (Reuters) - The near-constant crump of shellfire washed over this battered hamlet on Wednesday, testifying to fierce fighting beyond its wind-swept fields between Ukrainian troops pressing a counter-offensive and Russian forces that once occupied the area. While Ukrainian troops drove their foes from Vilkhivka in early April, the narrow lanes remain blighted by shrapnel, shell craters, and downed wires, and lined by houses pulverized into wood splinters and brick chunks. Three Russian portable rocket launchers lay at the intersection of Ukrainian and Moladzhna streets. Carcasses of rotting animals littered verges, yards and an agricultural enterprise and a damaged Ukrainian tank sat near the hulks of two Russian armored vehicles dragged into a makeshift checkpoint. The bloated corpse of a Russian soldier, mouth frozen in a deathly grimace, swollen chest bursting from a grey tunic, still lay moldering outside the fire-blacked shell of the local school that his unit had commandeered for a base. ""I grew up here and went to this school,"" said Andrii Korkin, 48, a contractor who came from the nearby city of Kharkiv to inspect his parents' home. ""I am a Russian speaker. Russian is my native language. I want nothing to do any more with the world of the Russian Federation."" As the lanky father of two spoke, distant bursts of artillery fire and fusillades of multiple rocket launchers echoed across fields that normally would be sown with corn and wheat. Vilkhivka lies less than 30 km (20 miles) south of the Russian border, close to which fighting rages between Ukrainian troops on a counter-offensive launched this month and Russian forces that failed to overrun Kharkiv when Moscow invaded on Feb. 24. The Ukrainian military reported new gains on Wednesday that signaled a possible shift in the course of the war, with troops advancing to within a few kilometers of the frontier, according to a Ukrainian military source. Moscow invaded in what the Kremlin calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise a neighbor that threatened Russia's security. Ukraine and its allies call that a lie, accusing Russia of an unprovoked aggresion that has killed thousands, uprooted millions and destroyed towns and cities. Villagers have only just begun filtering back to Vilkhivka to retrieve furniture and clothing from properties that escaped serious damage or to pick through the rubble of those that did not, salvaging what they can despite the risk from unexploded ordnance. Although Ukrainian soldiers bore the brunt of the fighting that drove the Russians out, Nikolay Riyanko, a grizzled 67-year-old pensioner, said he and other residents lent a hand. On the first night the invaders occupied Vilkhivka, he said, villagers stole a Russian diesel-filled tanker truck, and another loaded with ammunition. He filched a box of six rocket propelled grenades that he eventually gave to Ukrainian troops. “They burned Russian equipment and soldiers with those shells,” he said, recounting his tale before returning to shuttling belongings from his shell-torn home to an old car parked before a crater from a Russian missile. It remains lay close by. Before the fighting erupted, he said, Russian troops concealed themselves in homes. “They were hiding behind the locals,” said Riyanko. “They gathered about 30 people and kept us near one of their positions. There they had a machine gun, a tank, an infantry fighting vehicle.” “They kept us from 6 am to 5 pm so that the Ukrainian military would not shoot,” he continued. Eventually the Russians released the group, and the battle of Vilkhivka began. “Can they really be called real soldiers after that?” he spat. “They are motherfuckers, not military men!” “I sent my wife to the basement of my friend, but I did not have time to hide. We lived for eight days in the basements,” Riyanko recalled. “When the shell hit my house, the debris crushed my head. I got a concussion. I couldn’t hear anything for three days.” Civilian volunteers from Kharkiv eventually arrived to evacuate Riyanko, his wife and other villagers. “Today is the first time I have come back,” he said. “While I sort out the rubble and debris in my house, I'll stay with my neighbors for a while. Their house survived.” (Reporting by Jonathan Landay; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",World/Reuters,Sounds of Ukrainian counter-offensive echo in ruined village near Russia's border,https://news.yahoo.com/sounds-ukrainian-counter-offensive-echo-164149929.html
