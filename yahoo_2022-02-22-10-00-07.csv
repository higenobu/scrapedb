2/22/2022,"TOKYO (Reuters) -Most Japanese think the rollout of booster shots against COVID-19 is too slow and many give mixed reviews to Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's handling of the pandemic, including last week's decision to ease border rules, a poll showed. Anger over the Japanese government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic helped sink the administration of Kishida's predecessor, Yoshihide Suga, and Kishida faces a crucial election for the upper house of parliament in July. About 73% of respondents to a Kyodo news agency opinion poll over the weekend felt Japan's rollout of booster shots has been far too slow, though 54.1% approved of how the government had tackled the coronavirus overall. Only 14.4% of the population has received booster shots even though nearly 30% of the country is 65 or older and at greater risk without the protection of the booster. Kishida, who has repeatedly promised to accelerate the booster programme, told a news conference last week he has yet to receive his booster, but should get one early in March. The booster programme has picked up steam in recent days, with more than 700,000 shots a day - nearing Kishida's goal of 1 million by the end of February. Still, February became the deadliest month of the pandemic for Japan on Saturday, with 3,033 deaths so far this month. Nearly half of respondents to the two-day telephone survey said it was ""too early"" to loosen border controls, which have among been the strictest among wealthy nations but were slammed by businesses and educators, a move set to take place in stages from March 1. About 45.7% said the decision, which will open borders to foreigners except for tourists, came too early, Kyodo said, while 34.9% said it was ""appropriate"" and 16.3% saw it as too late. Overall, Kishida's support rose slightly to 56.6% although disapproval of his government edged up 2.2 points to 27.4%.

2/22/2022,"Feb. 21â€”The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department will likely bill a 26-year-old New Jersey woman who needed to be rescued from the Liberty Spring Trail in Lincoln on Sunday. About 4:30 p.m., the department was notified of a hiker in distress on the trail. A hiking companion called 911 for help, according to a news release. A conservation officer and Pemigewasset Valley Search and Rescue team members met the hiker, Aleeza Shaikh, 26, from Jersey City, about 5:56 p.m. approximately a mile from the trailhead. A group of hikers had come across Shaikh lying in the trail and assisted in getting her moving again, according to the news release. ""Aleeza was able to hike the rest of the way down the trail with minor assistance, accompanied by a small rescue party,"" the news release reads. The group made it to the Liberty Springs parking lot by 7 p.m. The hikers were only planning a day trip and did not have the equipment needed to spend the night, according to the news release. Fish and Game expects to send a bill to the hikers for the preventable rescue, according to the news release.

2/22/2022,"TAIPEI (Reuters) -Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, placed under sanctions by China when he left office at the end of the Trump presidency last year, will visit Taiwan next week and meet President Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan's government said on Monday. Taiwan's foreign ministry said Pompeo and his wife would visit the Chinese-claimed island from March 2-5, and also meet Foreign Minister Joseph Wu and give a speech at a think-tank. ""Former Secretary of State Pompeo is a long-term and staunch friend of Taiwan and made outstanding contributions to promoting Taiwan-U.S. relations during his time in office,"" the ministry said in a statement. His visit shows the bipartisan ""rock solid"" U.S. support for Taiwan and the close Taiwan-U.S. friendship, it added. The Donald Trump administration gave strong backing to Taiwan, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties, including high profile arms sales and visits of top U.S. officials to Taipei. China put sanctions on ""lying and cheating"" Pompeo and 27 other top Trump-era officials as President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin noted that Pompeo had been sanctioned by China due to his ""anti-China actions"". Taiwan will only ""get burned"" in its attempts to solicit support from the United States for its independence, he told reporters. China has stepped up its military and diplomatic pressure against Taiwan over the past two years seeking to force the island to accept its sovereignty. Taiwan's government says it wants peace but will defend itself if attacked, and that only the island's people have the right to decide their future. Separately, Wang also announced sanctions on U.S. companies Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Technologies Corp over U.S. arms sales to Taiwan, at least the third time it has announced punishments against the firms.
