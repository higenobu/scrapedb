1/14/2022,"British Vogue has hailed a new era that centres African fashion. The magazine’s February issue features nine dark-skinned models of African heritage on its cover, including Adut Akech. Seemingly referencing Peter Lindbergh’s “Supers” Vogue cover from 1990, which introduced the world to the idea of the supermodel, the shot is a challenge to the traditionally white fashion industry which has, since the murder of George Floyd, been under pressure to change and become more inclusive and diverse.  There has been transparency around discrimination at fashion publications and racial profiling in shops, while diversity on the catwalk has increased. According to the Fashion Spot’s annual diversity report, 43% of the models who walked during the autumn/winter shows of 2021 were women of colour. “I know there’s so many little black girls who will look at this cover and feel something. I hope it makes you feel seen, heard and happy as it did me,” wrote Nyagua Ruea, one of the models who appears in the magazine. Ruea and Akech are featured alongside Anok Yai, Majesty Amare, Amar Akway, Janet Jumbo, Maty Fall, Abény Nhial and Akon Changkou. With a new generation of African models in the spotlight, fashion is at last embracing what it is to be truly global. With British Vogue's momentous all African February cover, meet the young women redefining what it is to be a model: https://t.co/I5J2Yps09I pic.twitter.com/WAPV2feNob British Vogue’s editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, who identifies as British Ghanaian, said the photograph was an important statement of anti-tokenism. “No longer just one or two dark-skinned girls mingled backstage, but a host of top models took a meaningful, substantial and equal place among the most successful women working in fashion today. It means so much to me to see it,” he said. The cover photographer, Rafael Pavarotti, called it a “celebration of women, of matriarchy and of the beauty of black women”. The cover represents a challenge to the historically Eurocentric fashion gaze, which has long stereotyped Africa as a continent in need of charity and lacking creative autonomy. Last year the model Naomi Campbell highlighted the regressive attitudes towards African fashion. “There has, in the past, been the wrong perception about the continent and the creativity that comes out of it,” she told the Observer. “Right now, everyone’s kind of got it … but we don’t want African to be considered as a trend.” Enninful said the cover was another step forward in altering those outdated attitudes. “The rise of African representation in modelling is not only about symbolism, nor even simple beauty standards,” he wrote. “It’s about the elevation of a continent. It’s about economics, access, culture, perspective, difference and wonder.” The re-evaluation of the continent’s contribution to the industry continues in June with an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum, which will feature the work of trailblazing designers Kofi Ansah and Folashade “Shade” Thomas-Fahm.",Lifestyle/Fashion,British Vogue hails new era with nine African models on cover ,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/14/british-vogue-hails-new-era-with-nine-african-models-on-cover
1/14/2022,"No 10 has apologised to the Queen for two parties that took place in Downing Street on the eve of Prince Philip’s funeral last year, Boris Johnson’s spokesperson has said. The Daily Telegraph reported that two separate leaving parties, for the former director of communications James Slack and a government photographer, were held on 16 April, with drinking continuing into the early hours.  Confirming an apology had been issued to Buckingham Palace, the prime minister’s spokesperson said: “It’s deeply regrettable that this took place at a time of national mourning, and No 10 has apologised to the Palace for that.” He declined to say whether Johnson would apologise in person to the Queen at his next private audience with her, but said the prime minister recognised the public’s “significant anger” about lockdown-busting social events. The monarch mourned alone at her husband’s funeral because Covid rules at the time prohibited indoor mixing. According to partygoers who spoke to the Telegraph, the events on 16 April continued into the early hours in the Downing Street garden. A staff member was reportedly sent with a suitcase to a Co-op store on the Strand, a short walk away, returning with the case filled with bottles of wine, and music was played. “You’ve heard from the prime minister this week. He’s recognised Number 10 should be held to the highest standards and take responsibility for things we did not get right,” the spokesman said. Slack, who worked closely with Theresa May before joining Johnson’s team, issued his own apology on Friday. He said: “I wish to apologise unreservedly for the anger and hurt caused, This event should not have happened at the time that it did. I am deeply sorry, and take full responsibility.” Johnson has come under intense pressure over revelations of a string of lockdown parties in Downing Street, which are being investigated by senior civil servant Sue Gray. The prime minister told MPs on Wednesday that he had attended a gathering in the Downing Street garden on 20 May 2020 – but claimed he had believed it was a “work event”. Several MPs including Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, and backbencher Andrew Bridgen, have since called for Johnson to resign. Gray is expected to point to a drinking culture in Downing Street – but it is unclear whether she will point the finger directly at Johnson. The spokesman declined to say whether he attended Slack’s leaving party himself, insisting it would be “inappropriate to comment” in advance of Gray’s inquiry. “We think it’s right to allow Sue Gray to finalise and conclude her investigation which will set out the full facts,” he said.",News/Politics,No 10 apologises to palace over parties on eve of Prince Philip funeral ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/14/no-10-apologises-palace-parties-eve-prince-philip-funeral-queen-covid

The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, also said it would no longer be a legal requirement for people to work from home, though it would still be important for them to do so if possible.  Drakeford thanked citizens for obeying the rules, which have been in place in Wales since Boxing Day, and for everyone who has been involved in the vaccination programme. He said: “The actions we have taken together have helped us to weather the Omicron storm. The latest data suggests some positive signs that the peak may have passed. We can now look more confidently to the future and plan to start gradually removing the alert level two restrictions, starting with the outdoors measures. “But the pandemic is not over. We will closely monitor the public health situation – this is a fast-moving and volatile variant, which could change suddenly. I urge everyone to continue to follow the rules and have your vaccines to keep Wales safe.” The latest public health data in Wales suggests cases of coronavirus have started to fall back from very high levels. More than two-thirds of people aged 12 and over have received a booster or third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Drakeford said that from Saturday the number of people who could be present at outdoor events would rise from 50 to 500. Then from Friday 21 January Wales will move to alert level zero for all outdoor activities, meaning there will be no limits on the number of people who can take part in outdoor activities. The government said this meant: Crowds will be able to return to outdoor sporting events Outdoor hospitality will be able to operate without additional measures. But a Covid pass will be required for entry to larger outdoor events. If the downward trend continues, from Friday 28 January Wales will move to alert level zero for all indoor activities. Nightclubs will be able to reopen. Working from home will remain important but it will no longer be a legal requirement. Businesses, employers and other organisations must undertake a specific coronavirus risk assessment and take reasonable measures to minimise the spread of Covid.

1/14/2022,"Ed Sheeran has applied to construct a crypt under the floor of a chapel on his estate in East Anglia. The singer-songwriter, who was Spotify’s second-most streamed artist of the 2010s behind Drake, gained approval to build the “private place of retreat for contemplation and prayer” in 2019 on his Suffolk estate, which is worth an estimated £3.7m.  A further application seeks permission for a crypt in the nave of the chapel. The crypt – typically a burial chamber under the floor of a church – would be a 1.8 by 2.7 metre “burial zone beneath (penetration through slab)” on the chapel’s ground floor. The application was filed to East Suffolk council in December and is awaiting a decision. The chapel will be flint-lined and feature a spiral-stair tower, lead roof and stained-glass windows. Sheeran, 30, has sparked controversy with his Suffolk estate, which is nicknamed “Sheeranville” by some and features a collection of properties, pub, gym and wildlife pond. It is near the town of Framlingham and close to where Sheeran grew up. Sheeran has hit headlines with reports of planning disputes with neighbours, including an incident in which a resident said the “wildlife pond” was a swimming pool. Sheeran rejects this characterisation. He lives on the estate with his wife, Cherry Seaborn, and their daughter, Lyra Antarctica Seaborn Sheeran, who was born in 2020. According to the 2019 planning application for the chapel, people from around the world visit Sheeran’s estate. “Many of these people are from many countries, faiths and customs, including for example the USA, Ireland, Ghana, Nigeria, Asia and Australia,” it said.",Arts/Music,Ed Sheeran applies to build crypt under floor of Suffolk estate chapel,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/14/ed-sheeran-applies-to-build-crypt-under-floor-of-suffolk-estate-chapel
1/14/2022,"On the first afternoon of Hobart’s Ashes debut, the knives were out for Bellerive Oval. Australia had lost David Warner, Usman Khawaja and Steve Smith for a combined six runs, while Australia as a team had scored 12. The pitch looked like it belonged to the Emerald City. Accordingly, people online started getting stuck into the surface as no good, a lottery, a disgrace, or anything else they could think of, proclaiming that Hobart had blown its entree to big-league Test cricket and that the city should never get a Test again.  Except that over the next hour or so, Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne produced a passage that featured 71 runs in 69 balls, repeatedly taking on the bowling to great effect. Stuart Broad and Ollie Robinson had been difficult to face at the start of the innings with jagging seam movement, but as soon as Mark Wood came on, his extra pace disappeared to the fence with corresponding speed. Chris Woakes got battered in conditions that should have suited him. The life went out of the pink ball, and began to leak out of England too. After Travis Head’s rapid 152 in the Brisbane Ashes Test, you could wonder how much it had been an innings smiled on by fortune. His attacking range and run-a-ball pace created plenty of close calls, but ones that he survived to produce a surge of runs. Repeating the dose in Hobart made the strong suggestion that Brisbane was not a fluke. There was method to the approach, as Head produced an innings of such counterpunching potency that it reversed a tide. It bears repeating that the score was 12 for 3 when Head walked in. A No 5, returning after a Test out with Covid, walking on within the first 10 overs. Cloudy skies and a moving ball. So he clipped his second ball for three, and laced his ninth through cover for four. Two balls later, another to the fence with a square drive. There was a tactical point to this, recognising that England’s bowling had been so accurate that defensive play was likely to make him an easier target. Hitting back could disrupt the bowlers, and his best chance to score was to do it before receiving a ball he couldn’t play. But there were no more unplayables. The first batting partnership barrage ended when Labuschagne bizarrely went wandering outside off stump, leaving Broad an untended set of stumps to knock over. Those bloody green pitches, hey? Undeterred, Head carried on playing a shot a ball. His only defensive response was to those full and straight. Anything outside off stump, he punched off the back foot or drove off the front depending on length. Sometimes he found the field, mostly he did not. By the time it was over he had made 101 from 113 balls, chipping a catch right after raising his hundred. It was a telling intervention from a player whose approach to the game has changed. Always regarded domestically as an attacking type, Head’s batting strike rate in Test cricket before this series was 49. Through the current series he has scored at 87. He looked liberated in doing so at the Gabba, which flowed into a fast fifty in Adelaide and now this hundred. In Hobart, Head played attacking shots to almost half of the deliveries he faced, a rate he has never exceeded before. Across the series he now leads the run scoring on both sides with 349 from 399 balls. In all of Ashes history, only Ian Botham in his famous 1981 effort has made as many runs in a series at a faster strike rate, with 399 from 428 balls at 93. With an innings to play, Head could yet go past him. There is individual brilliance to appreciate there, but also the fact that a pitch on which he could play that innings was a good one for playing cricket. Teams are allowed to take wickets. Batting is allowed to be hard. Test matches can go for five days, but nothing in the Laws says that they must. Plenty of dull matches go the distance, plenty of interesting ones are over in shorter time. All of those things are OK. Hobart’s lively start made this an exciting contest, which will make people want to tune in on the second day to see where the game has gone. In all those respects, Hobart’s Ashes beginning has gone exactly to plan.",Sport/Sport,Travis Head gets reward for attacking flair and rescues Hobart’s Ashes debut  | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/travis-head-gets-reward-for-attacking-flair-and-rescues-hobarts-ashes-debut
1/14/2022,"England name their squad for the Six Nations championship on Tuesday. With the 2023 Rugby World Cup just over the horizon, here are six key questions for Eddie Jones to resolve.  Sporting life can be extraordinarily harsh. A touch of Covid, the rise of Marcus Smith and, most recently, ankle surgery have combined to make Farrell’s future a matter of some debate. Even if Eddie Jones’s captain, now 30, is instantly back on it when he returns for Saracens this month, the management will be conscious of what happened this time last year. Exhibit A will be Jones’s ill-fated decision to keep faith with some rusty Saracens that helped Scotland win at Twickenham for the first time since 1983. Once bitten, twice shy? With Courtney Lawes having impressed as a stand-in skipper, Farrell’s captaincy is also less essential than it was. Given Smith’s autumn promise, it would be a retrograde step not to start the Harlequin at 10. That leaves three options for Farrell: shift him to centre, stick him on the bench or save him up for later in the tournament. If Manu Tuilagi is fit then he and Henry Slade are currently the best English centre combination. But who would not want Farrell’s warrior example, iron will and match-turning goal-kicking? On a dark, cold night in Murrayfield, there could be a case for the bench option. Let’s state the glaringly obvious. The best No8 in this season’s Premiership has been Alex Dombrandt of Harlequins. Those who still consider him a flighty risk clearly did not watch the Big Game at Twickenham just after Christmas. It is not just the way the 24-year-old pops up in all the right places, it is the depth of rugby intelligence when he does so. His attacking angles are beautifully chosen, he holds his depth to make sure he can surge on to the ball and his understanding with Smith appears telepathic. Yet Jones, of late, has picked Tom Curry at eight with Dombrandt on the bench, preferring the defensive excellence of Sam Underhill alongside Lawes in the back row. Against Scotland though, England will need more ball-carrying oomph and Dombrandt’s breakdown skills will also be useful – which is tough on the dynamic Sam Simmonds, Billy Vunipola and, potentially, Underhill. But now is the time for Jones to look forward, not back. In all the excitement surrounding England’s breathless 27-26 win over the world champion Springboks in November, it was possible to gloss over the second-half travails of England’s scrum and maul. Admittedly their propping stocks were diminished by Covid and injury, propelling Sale’s Bevan Rodd into the spotlight, but England have not been ruling the set pieces with the iron fist that Jones is seeking. It would also be stretching it to say Kyle Sinckler and Will Stuart have been ripping it up at club level, even if scrummaging is never a one-man operation. The two standout English-qualified Premiership props just now are probably Joe Marler and Dan Cole but will Jones fancy recalling the latter four months shy of his 35th birthday? Harlequins’ Will Collier would hold an end up but is he going to win a World Cup? This is also a big Six Nations for Matt Proudfoot, England’s scrum coach. While Proudfoot helped South Africa to 2019 World Cup glory his CV is not without its leaner patches. He won four caps for Scotland via his Dumfries-born grandmother without tasting victory and also endured a nasty bout of Covid just prior to the 2021 Six Nations when England finished fifth. He will be keen for a more upbeat start to 2022. It invariably seems to be touch and go with Tuilagi. All that hard work to make the team in the autumn and he lasted just eight minutes against South Africa before his hamstring went. This time he is aiming to prove his fitness against his old club Leicester on 30 January, just six days before England are due at Murrayfield. Already it feels worryingly tight – the timescale, not the hamstring – unless Jones is truly desperate. This might, as previously mentioned, re-open the door for Farrell or potentially an alternative 12. The Gloucester centre Mark Atkinson has been around numerous blocks, will fancy second-guessing his clubmate Chris Harris in Scotland’s midfield and has a deft kicking game. Failing that, Jones could slide Slade to 12 and keep faith with Joe Marchant, who was influential against South Africa, or quietly recall the criminally underrated Saracen Alex Lozowski. Jones has already picked 20 different centre pairings during his tenure and a 21st may be brewing. Flip back to this time last year and who were the squad’s exciting, fresh-faced newcomers? Step forward Paolo Odogwu and Harry Randall who, for assorted reasons, did not play a minute of Six Nations rugby between them. As a result we still don’t really know whether they have “it” or not. It was a similar tale with Louis Lynagh last autumn. This time expect Wasps’ bullocking Alfie Barbeary to be there or thereabouts when the squad list is unveiled. So prodigious is his ball-carrying strength that the 21-year-old has been encouraged to switch from hooker to the back-row and he also loves a challenge, as underlined in his club’s last-ditch stand against Leicester last Sunday. The time has also come for England to identify their preferred choices at scrum-half and on the wing and then stick with them. If Alex Mitchell and Adam Radwan are to be World Cup squad members, now is the time to trust them more. It is worth stressing that this year’s championship will be as competitive as a sack of hungry ferrets. England fans may also recall Storm Ciara, which made the corresponding 2020 fixture even trickier. Without a costly misjudgment from Stuart Hogg, which delivered the five-metre scrum platform from which Ellis Genge scored the game’s only try, England might now be travelling north having not defeated their hosts in the Six Nations for five years. Scotland’s team-sheet will be well stocked with Lions and last year they won in both London and Paris. In the past England have been ambushed by something they failed to see coming but those days have long gone. And Jacob Rees-Mogg has already written the home side’s pre-game team talk.",Sport/Sport,Six Nations countdown: six England squad dilemmas for Eddie Jones | Robert Kitson,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/six-nations-countdown-england-squad-dilemmas-for-eddie-jones-rugby-union
1/14/2022,"This lovely concert marked the start of Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen’s Artist Spotlight series at the Barbican, which runs until the end of the season. Guildhall masterclasses, a programme of arias and duets with tenor Freddie de Tommaso (they share the same record label), and a concert with the Oslo Philharmonic can be heard in the spring. First, however, came this recital of songs by Grieg, Strauss and Wagner with her compatriot Leif Ove Andsnes, a starry pairing, and a really effective one on this showing. Davidsen’s voice is notable for its amplitude, power and fullness of tone, remarkable for a singer still only in her early 30s, and already defining her as a major Wagnerian. What immediately impressed in this instance, however, was her wide dynamic range, subtly deployed and often beautifully controlled. When unleashed, as at the climax of Strauss’s Befreit, the sound is oceanic and thrilling. Most striking here, though, was the comparative restraint of much of her singing, and the intimate sense of light and shade that came with it.  Her performance of Grieg’s song cycle Haugtussa (The Mountain Maid), with its sad, sweet evocation of love and heartbreak, was remarkable for its delicacy: the flash of silver in Davidsen’s upper registers when the voice is not under pressure was particularly beguiling here. The brooding introspection of Strauss’s Ruhe, Meine Seele and rapt contentment of Morgen were beautifully captured, while Wagner’s Wesendonck Lieder were for the most part about refined depths of passion rather than self-consciously lofty declarations of feeling, though a telling surge of emotion at the climax of Schmerzen spoke volumes about the music’s underlying intensity. On occasion, Davdisen’s consonants slipped a little, and one wanted more of the words, but much of this was magnificent nevertheless. Andsnes’s playing, meanwhile, was exquisite throughout – wonderfully intelligent and considered, the meaning of every phrase and figuration carefully probed and exposed.

1/14/2022,"The Twyford Code by Janice Hallett (Viper, £14.99)Hallett’s bestselling debut The Appeal, an intelligent mystery set within the deceptively genteel confines of a local am-dram group, was a modern epistolary novel, told in emails. Her second is even better, and presented as audio files, complete with intriguing mistakes made by the transcription software. Recorded on an iPhone by ex-con Steven Smith for his probation officer, they are records of his attempts to find his old English teacher, who disappeared on a school trip to Bournemouth, erstwhile home of Blytonesque children’s writer Edith Twyford. Twyford’s books are catnip to conspiracy theorists; they’re thought to contain a code that may have something to do with their author’s activities during the second world war. Steven, with help from his former classmates and a librarian, sets out to crack it – and, in the process, solve the puzzle of his own life. This fiendishly clever book, which manages to be both tricksy and surprisingly moving, is the perfect antidote to the post-Christmas carb stupor.  The Second Cut by Louise Welsh (Canongate, £14.99)Twenty years after Welsh’s award-winning debut The Cutting Room comes the return of gay auctioneer Rilke, now middle aged but still tiptoeing around the edges of Glasgow’s criminal underworld. When old friend Jojo is found dead after giving Rilke a tip-off about a lucrative house clearance in Galloway, the police are inclined to write it off as the result of a decadent lifestyle – Jojo had a fondness for Grindr hook-ups and chemsex parties – but Rilke decides to investigate. The house clearance isn’t quite what it seems, either. There’s the abandoned car in which two people died, the terrified Asian man who may be on the run from people traffickers, the terrier found locked in a chest – and what’s happened to the elderly lady who owned the place? Complex and very atmospheric, with plenty of sardonic humour and sharp observations about injustice, like its predecessor this is a hardboiled gem. The Maid by Nita Prose (HarperCollins, £14.99)If you have already trashed your new year’s resolutions, you could do a lot worse than console yourself with this delightful cosy mystery. The narrator, neurodivergent 25-year-old Molly Gray, works at the Regency Grand Hotel, in an unspecified North American city. Although her tendency to take things literally causes some problems, she loves the anonymity afforded by her uniform and finds comfort in restoring order, especially after the death of the beloved grandmother who raised her. Although some colleagues are supportive, others abuse her trust and, when she discovers the body of tycoon Charles Black in the penthouse suite, she soon finds herself in the frame for his murder. The plot is undemanding, and readers will find themselves several steps ahead of Molly at any given time because of her difficulty in decoding situations and reading social cues, but her bravery, kindness and lack of artifice are engaging enough to have you rooting for her all the way. Wahala by Nikki May (Doubleday, £14.99)“Wahala” means, loosely, trouble, and there’s plenty of it in this entertaining debut. Friends since university, where they bonded over their mixed Nigerian and British heritage, Ronke, Boo and Simi now live in London, where they pivot between cultures. Dentist Ronke wants to settle down with her unreliable boyfriend; Boo, feeling trapped by family life, is contemplating an affair; and Simi, who is making headway in her career, isn’t as keen as her husband on having a baby … but their friendship is rock solid until glamorous Isabel, an old schoolfriend of Simi’s, arrives to drive a wedge between them, homing in mercilessly on each woman’s weak point. Mystery takes second place to character study, and by the end of the story the vengeful Isabel is teetering dangerously on the edge of caricature, but Wahala is a fascinating, funny and nuanced look at identity and female friendship. Real Easy by Marie Rutkoski (Tinder, £18.99)There’s female friendship of a different sort in children’s author Rutkoski’s adult debut: the camaraderie, or lack thereof, among exotic dancers at an Illinois strip club. When Samantha, AKA Ruby, reluctantly agrees to drive new colleague Lady Jade home from the Lovely Lady, they are run off the road – but police officer Victor Amador finds only one body. Real Easy is more than the story of the subsequent investigation: multiple narrators including dancers, their relatives, detectives, club patrons and the killer himself offer a kaleidoscopic view of a morally precarious world where male desire is a whisker away from male violence. With a cast of fully realised characters – the cops have troubles of their own, and life at the club, with its overlay of sleazy glamour, is balanced by domestic vignettes and quotidian concerns – this is a familiar story told in a way that packs a real emotional punch.",Arts/Books, The best recent crime and thrillers – review roundup,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/14/the-best-recent-and-thrillers-review-roundup
1/14/2022,"He lied. He clearly lied. But so what? As Boris Johnson hangs on by his fingertips, we wait to see who will stamp on them. The answer is presumably Sue Gray, to whose final mercies he has desperately handed his fate. Surely nothing she says can rescue him. At question is not his guilt, only his punishment.  Johnson can plead that he was “advised” that office parties were within the rules. He can protest they were “implicitly” work-related, but with even more revelations about Downing Street parties on the front pages today, the edifice of Downing Street concealment and deceit is crumbling before voters’ eyes. In that uniquely British political theatre, the House of Commons, the prime minister was subjected on Wednesday to the nearest democracy gets to medieval trial by ordeal. MPs abandoned all dignity, nuance, sympathy or sense of proportion. They gleefully yelled and jeered and hurled insults until hoarse with rage. When in the mood, parliament does not talk truth to power: it screams in its face. The prime minister’s unhappy relationship with the truth is longstanding and embedded in his character. Veracity is trumped by ego. Most of his recent catalogue of woes – Brexit promises, dodgy peerages, sleazy colleagues, flat decorations, lockdown parties – could have been soothed had Johnson simply come clean early on, appeared frank and apologised. He seems psychologically unable to disentangle falsity from half-truth. A life spent in bland denials and upmarket jokes has lent him a high-risk belief in his invulnerability. From each laughable lie he could, in one bound, leap free. Champions of political mendacity make much of its role in democratic leadership. In his study of political hypocrisy, David Runciman argues that fake sincerity, false promises and the fabrication of evidence are tools that have always lain close to the heart of power. He cites leaders from Oliver Cromwell and Thomas Jefferson to Bill Clinton and Tony Blair. The latter’s Iraq war was fought on a lie. Peter Oborne’s The Rise of Political Lying has Blair’s spin doctor Alastair Campbell as its virtual hero, with his boss plumbing constant depths of mendacity. Yet Blair won three elections. Party manifestos are dismissed as “books of lies”. Some would argue that Johnson won the Brexit referendum by the “big lie” of its economic gains, which played much to his advantage at the 2019 election. Runciman argues that democracy requires a degree of cynicism to fuel its optimism, its promise of eternal hope, without which no one would ever vote for any politician ever. Politics thus becomes a mutual conspiracy of mendacity. As Orwell wrote, “Political language … is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.” Johnson’s problem has not been his lying but his inability to manage it, notably when found out. He has no spin doctor, and on Wednesday had to admit himself to spin A&E. His belief that a winsome and “authentic” personality could make up for a rotten command structure and third-class aides exploded on him. His critics might accept that governing a pandemic would be a titanic test for even the most experienced of leaders, requiring superhuman skills of authority and persuasion, an ability to call on an unprecedented degree of public trust. But that is all the more reason not to imperil that trust. The prime minister has delivered some successes, including vaccination and the current holdout against lockdown. But these successes have been swamped by one fiasco after another, leading to a widespread judgment that he is “not fit for purpose”, not up to the job, a charge never made against Blair. A BBC vox pop on Wednesday night was brutal: “I may like him, but enough is enough.” Johnson has tried to fuse Alexis de Tocqueville’s distinction between Britain’s democracy of the club and America’s democracy of the mob. His appeal to the Tory club has lain exclusively in his popularity with the mob. He won elections as a populist. It is conceivable that a newly chastened and apologetic Johnson might try to charm his way back into favour, in the hope that the 10 percentage points now separating Labour from the Tories in the polls might be reversed. Club members might then hold their noses and give him another chance. As it is, any such poll surge seems most unlikely, which is why Keir Starmer is surely unwise to shout for the prime minister’s resignation. He should pray for him to limp on. For Johnson, an ominous parallel is the Tory party’s ruthless ejection of Thatcher in 1990. It cleansed the Downing Street stables of the poll tax toxin, and went on under John Major to win a fourth election in a row in 1992. If, as seems likely, Johnson’s days as a politician are now numbered, Britain’s brief excursion into populist politics will have ended. The moral of the story will be modest: that journalists, for all their vanity, should not be tempted to give up the day job.

1/14/2022,"While heading over to Carmel in Queen’s Park, north-west London, in the first week of the new year, I’m reminded that January is always an odd time for reviewing. The entire month lends itself to hunkering down and clawing back, with venues closed for weeks on end and others offering the slenderest of hours, sometimes with the radiators off to save on bills. In fact, it often feels like the opposite of hospitality. I’ve sat in many a dead and draughty dining room in January feeling like the only person in Britain who isn’t having a can of Campbell’s soup on the sofa that evening. So it was a welcome sight to reach Carmel, hiding away on a side road close to the tube station, to find the place so damned welcoming and vibrant. It was a freezing cold Wednesday, but the place was busy with folk keen to try this new North African/East Mediterranean opening from the folk behind east London’s Berber & Q. Any customers eager to try anything in the current climate are a joyous sight, and Carmel exudes a sort of low-watt, twinkly joy, with candlelit tables, low-key music and delightful staff.  When Berber & Q opened in 2015, I was an instant fan, largely because it felt like a Middle Eastern grill house that had mated with an Ottolenghi cookbook and taken root in an Ibizan beach bar. Berber & Q was loud, very delicious, rather dark, completely unbookable and resided in a former minicab office that had had what felt like only a minor refurbishment. You’d eat the likes of smoked short-rib with date glaze or cauliflower shawarma with beets and whipped feta, and it was very much a case of dig in, get messy and throw everything you were wearing in for a boil wash when you got home. If all of that sounds a bit hectic, you’re in luck, because Carmel is its much more grown-up relative. Or, more accurately, it’s as if someone shook Berber & Q by the lapels, said, “It’s time to have a word with yourself, sonny”, and then gave it a side parting. There’s no loud, pulsating house music at Carmel, although the bathroom does have one of those weird aural soundscapes that made my dining companion Hugh wonder whether it was music or a broken air-conditioner unit; or maybe we’ve just both grown older. Carmel’s dinner menu is lush, laboured over and decidedly finickety. A bowl of silky, high-class hummus, for example, is made grander with a rich, lamb ragu topping garnished with pistachio and curry leaf, while a top-quality cured sardine appears prettily arranged on a bed of ratte potato, piped soured cream and doused in lemon verjus. Both are delicious and clearly painstakingly road-tested, even if they barely scrape the surface of our appetites. We share some charred hispi cabbage – one whole quarter, to be exact – expertly crisped and caramelised, served on a bed of labneh and made irresistible with macadamia dukkah. A bowl of gnocchi is spookily cloud-like, and a million miles from the starchy bullets I make at home. Carmel’s gnocchi come in a vibrant, spring sunlight-coloured turmeric yoghurt sauce with spinach and mizithra cheese; the dish is perhaps a little too delicately seasoned, but the tenderness of those gnocchi lives on in my mind. Three fearsomely large prawns, their shells caked in harissa, arrive in a pan of ’nduja butter with courgette tzatziki, and are beautifully flavoured, albeit a terrific, messy job to deal with. With almost everything at Carmel, the real flavours are in the smears, yoghurts and dressings, with not a whole lot of carbs on hand to bulk out the dishes. Thankfully, though, there are warm, fresh sourdough flatbreads with toppings such as spiced lamb with aleppo chilli or, in our case, tarama with soft sliced potato and rosemary to provide a little heft for hungry diners. Large plates for sharing begin at £25 for the slow-grilled urfa chicken, which turns up on a perilously sweet-bitter pomegranate molasses-soaked piece of sourdough, with some curry-pickled radicchio on the side. The two of us demolish it easily. Other sharing plates include smoked lamb neck shawarma with a shio koji marinade and seared cod with palourde clams. A pudding of dark chocolate tart with tahini cream has a brittle, teeth-shatteringly sweet biscuit bottom, but it’s ridiculously lovely. In being all elegant and adult, Carmel may have lost something of the largesse of its east-London relative, but in cooking ingenuity, it leaves Berber & Q way behind. Carmel is dainty, delightful, good for both a date night and a cold midweek in early 2022, and it’s absolutely heaving. A most promising start to the eating-out year.

1/14/2022,"Rebel Wilson will host the 2022 Bafta film awards, it has been announced. The Australian actor, who has appeared in hits including Bridesmaids, Pitch Perfect and Jojo Rabbit, will take charge of the event at the Royal Albert Hall on 13 March after impressing organisers with comedy bits at previous ceremonies.  Amanda Berry, Bafta’s chief executive, said: “Rebel has stolen the show at several previous film awards, and we’re hugely excited to see her bring her fantastic charisma and humour to the whole show.” Wilson reacted with a statement in which she referenced a number of topical issues, including the controversy over her recent weight loss. She said: “It’s going to be so much fun! I don’t wanna put any pressure on this – I know I’m not going to be funny because I am no longer fat. And besides, I’m not going to ‘sweat-it’ with nerves because I have a peculiar medical condition where I can’t sweat … or cause offence to people because of my adorable Australian accent.” She added: “So basically, I’ll just be there to hang out with dame Judi Dench and together we’ll both try and bond with Daniel Craig. And yes, I do mean ‘bond’. This show will be an anniversary celebration of some important British film franchises such as Harry Potter and not such as Cats. Everybody’s going to love it, I’m sure!” The 2021 edition, hosted by Edith Bowman and Dermot O’Leary, was staged in the Royal Albert Hall with no audience and under social distancing conditions. The format for the 2022 awards has not yet been formally announced but a spokesperson said that, circumstances permitting, the current plan is for an “in-person event” with an audience.

1/14/2022,"I’ve decided to kick things off with a small helping of trauma, and ask: should our most troubling pop culture come with a warning? I’m thinking specifically of HBO’s no holds barred teen drama Euphoria, which returned to screens this week, and – for UK viewers – was preceded by an announcement that the episode contained “depictions of drug abuse, very strong language, some strong violence, scenes of a sexual nature and strong images of nudity from the start”. Elsewhere, there was a more explicit content warning on Instagram, where the show’s star and executive producer, Zendaya, said that season two was “deeply emotional” and “triggering”, urging fans to watch only if they felt comfortable.  Indeed, Cassie (Sydney Sweeney) getting covered in wee was far from the most harrowing part of an episode which featured a shooting at a strip club (complete with what will surely be the first of many erect penises we’ll see this series), heroin use, and a bloody beating. Trigger warning While many would have been grateful for the heads up, content warnings – sometimes known as trigger warnings – have been a divisive issue in film and TV. Research published by the British Board of Film Classification in September last year found that 64% of teenagers wanted to be alerted to the potential for distressing scenes in a movie – for example references to suicide, self-harm or eating disorders. However, many others believe that such warnings are unnecessary and a type of censorship, lumping them in with general “woke snowflake” criticism. Writing for right-wing site Spiked, Joanna Williams rallied against any extra warnings in cinemas, adding that “children are bombarded with messages telling them that ‘it’s okay not to be okay’ … adults have taught children that they are emotionally fragile”. But is it about “emotional fragility”, or merely appreciating the profound effects that films and television programmes can have on viewers of any age? It’s A Sin – Russell T Davies’s brilliant, sobering look at life during the 80s Aids crisis – is a case in point. Initially released on Channel 4 and its streaming platform All 4 without any warnings, many viewers were enthralled by the show but startled by its graphic portrayal of the severe illness and death caused by HIV/Aids (a friend of mine said the show had given them nightmares, and that their worries about having already contracted the illness were “debilitating”). Viewers and charities such as the Terrence Higgins Trust asked the broadcaster to look into adding extra guidance. What followed was an excellent example of a programme maker doing a quick 180 to take in the wider cultural conversation, with messages about changes to sexual health and science, and support information added as the series went on. Similarly, Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You – about a young woman dealing with the aftermath of a suspected date rape – sparked conversations on topics such as stealthing, and came not only with content warnings but a toolkit for audiences, with a special online microsite of workshops which has been visited over two million times. Meanwhile, HBO set up a free 24/7 text crisis line for Euphoria, which has previously tackled issues including drug abuse and gender dysphoria. Wide awoke club Ultimately, it’s important for creators to think about how their work can and does affect people. After all, all the warnings in the world mean nothing if the actual content is potentially problematic (the eating disorder charity Beat, for example, took issue last year not with the lack of warnings around the Princess Diana biopic Spencer, but the fact that the film risked “glamorising” bulimia, and advised those who were currently unwell or concerned about their health not to watch it). As helpful as they are for some, trigger warnings may not work for everyone, which is all the more reason to go beyond them, and for film and TV-makers instead to think about what more they can do to help their viewers. Some may call it wokery but, well, they were probably never going to watch Euphoria anyway.

1/14/2022,"Gary Waldhorn, who has died aged 78, played some political high flyers on television in his time – Caulaincourt, the diplomat and Second Empire loyalist, in Napoleon and Love (1974), and the raffish society diarist Chips Channon in Edward and Mrs Simpson (1978) – but his true talent lay in a curious ability to be pompous, boring and funny all at the same time. This was most famously demonstrated in his performance as David Horton, local squire and head of the parish council, in Richard Curtis’s The Vicar of Dibley (1994-2007), which starred Dawn French as the Rev Geraldine Granger, the feisty religious moderniser and chocaholic putting cats among pigeons in a sleepy Oxfordshire village just as, in real life, female vicars started sprouting all over the Church of England.  Waldhorn, of a bald and complacent demeanour, was the very embodiment of reactionary disapproval, but there was a twinkle about his bluster that, while no match for French’s joyful steam-rollering of the village idiots and worthies, made him an always watchable last line of resistance. This simple situation was wrung through two decades – there have been subsequent Christmas and charity specials, and “lockdown” episodes during the pandemic – without once going stale or losing its comic brio. Waldhorn commented on how strange it was, after so many years, to be recognised in the street, but took it all in his careful stride, pleased but not unduly excited. He had, after all, played supporting roles on stage in Laurence Olivier’s National Theatre at the Old Vic and with the Royal Shakespeare Company; had appeared on Broadway in 1982 with Alan Howard in CP Taylor’s quizzical play Good, about a “decent” Nazi; and with Judi Dench in a glorious RSC revival by Gregory Doran of All’s Well That Ends Well in Stratford-upon-Avon and the West End in 2004. Thanks to Dench glowing autumnally as the Countess of Roussillon, the notoriously “difficult” All’s Well – made to look not difficult at all –played to packed and enthusiastic houses for 10 weeks on Shaftesbury Avenue. But Waldhorn as the King of France was a subsidiary draw in a cast that also included Claudie Blakley as a delightful Helena, the young heroine who cures the king of a fistula. Waldhorn was born in London, the only child of Viennese Jewish refugees, Liselotte (nee Popper) and Siegfried Waldhorn. Siegfried acted as an interpreter for German prisoners of war in Britain and would become an executive vice-president of American Express. Meanwhile, the money Gary received for his bar mitzvah helped fund the family’s move to New York in 1956. He had already decided to be an actor after seeing Richard Burton at the Old Vic on a school trip. In the US, he was further educated at Ohio state university and the Yale drama school, where he met his future wife, Christie Dickason, a student of the critic and academic Robert Brustein. Dickason directed Waldhorn in student productions of The Knack by Ann Jellicoe and The Birthday Party by Harold Pinter. On graduating in 1967, the couple returned to settle in London, where Waldhorn appeared in Edmond Rostand’s Cyrano de Bergerac in the Open Air theatre, Regent’s Park, and, almost immediately, at the National. There, he was in Peter Brook’s infamous version of Seneca’s Oedipus, which featured John Gielgud, Irene Worth, a huge golden phallus on a plinth and various supernumeraries – of whom Waldhorn was one – lashed to the pillars in the stalls; they were frequently harassed by jovial customers in search of programmes and ice-creams. He also appeared as Jaques de Boys in John Dexter’s all-male As You Like It (with Ronald Pickup as the first male Rosalind), in Ben Jonson’s Volpone, and in Tom Stoppard’s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. Dickason, meanwhile, was working as a director and choreographer. Although she and Waldhorn married in 1970, they divorced a decade later having lived apart for some time, and she turned to writing novels. By now his parts were expanding, notably as a take-over lead in Anthony Shaffer’s long-running Sleuth at the St Martin’s in 1975. He was prominent at the Royal Exchange in Manchester from the mid-1970s, playing alongside Paul Scofield and Eleanor Bron in Ronald Harwood’s A Family (which moved to the Haymarket in London), the American playwright Larry Shue’s very funny The Nerd (with Derek Griffiths) and Waiting for Godot, with Max Wall and Trevor Peacock, in 1980. Waldhorn went against Samuel Beckett’s stipulations in slowing down Lucky’s great virtuoso speech but was the most comprehensible of all straggle-haired loons, suggesting a lifetime of memory in this one outpouring at the end of his master’s controlling rope. Waldhorn was busy on television before The Vicar of Dibley, turning up in most established serials; as a blazered suitor to his best friend’s widow, Maureen Lipman, in All at Number 20 (1986); and in the first three series of Brush Strokes (1986-89), as the exasperated employer of a cheeky chappy house-painter, Karl Howman. His few films included a bizarre wartime and football oddity directed by John Huston, Escape to Victory (1981), with a host of soccer stars including Bobby Moore, Pelé and Ossie Ardiles – and Sylvester Stallone. Waldhorn was the coach of a German military football team ranged against a team of prisoners of war in an exhibition match in Paris. He appeared on stage with Lipman in a fine production of Neil Simon’s Chapter Two at the Lyric, Hammersmith, in 1981 and, on the same stage in 1983, as the depraved Svidrigailov, exiting coolly to his suicide through a red door, in Yuri Lyubimov’s expressionist version of Crime and Punishment. He exhibited impressive power and range as Malvolio at the Royal Exchange in 1988, as King Henry for the English Touring Company’s Henry IV, parts 1 and 2, in 1996, and as Leonato in a spirited RSC Much Ado About Nothing in 2002. Waldhorn is survived by Joshua, his son with Dickason, and by two grandchildren, Cooper and Bailey.

1/14/2022," Tom Harrison, the chief executive who has overseen the last seven years of English cricket, has described the one-sided defeat in the men’s Ashes as a “brilliant opportunity” to “reset and recalibrate” the domestic game.  Speaking before the day-night fifth Test, Harrison expressed a desire that “fantastic” Joe Root remains as England captain and though Chris Silverwood, the head coach, was not afforded the same endorsement, a consolation victory in Hobart and a 3-1 scoreline in Australia would apparently represent “a better story”. Ashley Giles, the director of men’s cricket, and Mo Bobat, the performance director, are compiling a report on the tour but Harrison insisted they were “not marking their own homework”. This document will be submitted to the ECB’s cricket committee, chaired by Andrew Strauss, with recommendations then going to the governing body’s board. But Harrison, who said he drew satisfaction from England simply completing the tour given the various pandemic-related logistical headaches, has also suggested a wider review of the English game that asks “broader strategic questions” should also result from a 12-month period that returned a record nine Test defeats. “Our priority is Test cricket,” Harrison said. “We want to be successful at white-ball cricket, of course we do. But we absolutely need to be successful at Test cricket. “It feels like this is a moment to reset the importance of red-ball cricket in our domestic schedule and for us to recalibrate how we play first-class cricket in the UK. It’s a brilliant opportunity for us to come together as a game and really sort that once and for all. “There’s been plenty of debate around this, and sometimes the ability to effect change on something as complicated as our schedule is when you have a performance-related issue. And we have one now. “Let’s have the right balance of red and white ball. Let’s look at when we play red-ball cricket. There is a debate about whether we play more red-ball cricket through the summer. Let’s find a way to be able to do that. “We are trying to replicate conditions in Test cricket as much as possible. We do it really well in the white-ball game. We are currently not doing the right thing with respect to red-ball cricket. We have seen that play out over the last 12 months.” This Damascene moment will surprise many given English cricket’s apparent shift towards the white-ball formats under Harrison’s watch, not least the creation of a new short-form tournament, the Hundred, that has been placed on top of an already bulging county summer. The 50-year-old said he did not accept this interpretation of the ECB’s priorities, however, stressing the volume and scheduling of domestic formats was down to the Professional Game Group, which is made up of county chief executives. There is also the issue of the international calendar, which has seen a fixture pile-up caused by pandemic-related postponements and seen mental health shoot up the agenda due to quarantine periods and so-called “bubble” environments. Even if Covid-19 abates, the International Cricket Council has agreed a new broadcast deal with white-ball World Cups every year, while a similar squeeze on windows comes through the expansion of the Indian Premier League from eight teams to 10. Harrison added: “Less fixtures? Domestically, that’s certainly a debate we need to have. Internationally, when we get out of the immediate aftermath of the wake of Covid, we’ve got to look at how we manage fixture workloads. “This is something that the chief execs committee at ICC need to tackle in the round. With an additional few weeks of IPL every year and a World Cup every year ... it is a difficult challenge for world cricket. “I don’t think we’ve lived through a year of a 72-match IPL and a World Cup in the same year. 2022 will provide that and it’ll be interesting how we manage workloads.”",Sport/Sport,"Ashes defeat a ‘brilliant opportunity’ to reset domestic game, claims ECB chief",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/14/ashes-defeat-a-brilliant-opportunity-to-reset-domestic-game-says-tom-harrison
1/14/2022,"Villagers gather round kitchen tables, squabbling about the fate of huge trees, some of which have stood for centuries in front of their homes. What does one tree matter if its removal means the roads will be improved, argues a man, while an old woman mutters ominously about payback in the next life. Outside, majestic oaks and limes quiver as bulldozers carve trenches round their roots and industrial pipes are driven beneath their gnarled and mossy trunks. The aim is not to destroy them but to move them to a new home: a lush arboreal Shangri-La that is being conjured up by one of Georgia’s richest and most powerful men.  These little back-yard dramas, played out in the Georgian countryside over a period of two years, are the subject of Taming the Garden. It is the second feature film from the TV journalist turned documentary director Salomé Jashi, who was inspired to make it after seeing news footage of a tree floating sedately along the Black Sea coast on a boat. “The sensations that this image triggered in me were something I could have never have imagined before,” she says. “My first thought was that it was a totally dazzling image, it was real-life poetry. But then it was as if I was seeing something that I should never have seen, that should have never happened. It was like some sort of error; a digital glitch in reality that wasn’t supposed to exist.” She has recreated this sensation in a 90-minute documentary that has been hoovering up awards since its premiere at the Sundance festival in January, and which opens in the UK this month. On the surface, Taming the Garden is a faithful record of the tough negotiations and brutal mechanics of tree removal. One family are delighted to sell their tree. They are in debt and have been trying to kill it for years because it blocks the sun from their mandarin orchard. Others are left in grief, with gardens cratered like bombsites. All are unaware that the chosen specimen may not be the only tree to suffer; so will any lesser trees unfortunate enough to impede its transportation, sometimes by two lorries abreast, along roads that have to be specially widened for each journey. From this limb-cracking progress emerges a profoundly moving meditation on power, the vulnerability of nature and the primordial impulse of men to bend the environment to their will. It’s as if Oscar Wilde’s selfish giant is raging away in the background, though we never see him. The selfish giant of this story is the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, who emerged from obscurity to found a new party and become Georgia’s prime minister in 2012 (he voluntarily left office a year later). More than 200 trees were ripped from the Georgian countryside to make his pleasure garden. Getting villagers – and workmen – to appear on camera was the biggest challenge for Jashi, who had to abandon several storylines after people had second thoughts about taking part in the film. Planning ahead was impossible, as filming was entirely dependent on information from workers who often didn’t know how long it would take to complete a job or where they were going next. “Three months, six months, who knows?” they shrug, huddled round a campfire at the end of a long day. Georgia has strong laws on tree protection, Jashi points out, which made the project seem all the more controversial, while also landing local people with the problem of disposing of discarded branches, since they lacked the paperwork to sell them to sawmills. On one occasion, a beloved lime, with the names of generations of farmers carved into its trunk, was accidentally destroyed as it was moved. “That was a huge tragedy,” says the director. “We were sitting in this woman’s kitchen as she told me the story. She was crying, and I was crying as well, because the tree was really like a human being for her.” For all that the trees become the main protagonists of this slowly unfolding drama, there is also a strange heroism in the machinery that is pitted against them: bulldozers doggedly dig round them with crabbed claws, and juggernauts carry them, unblinking, through the night. As a child growing up in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, Jashi loved watching excavators at work. “They very much reminded me of human gestures somehow. And when we were filming I found it really attractive how this brutal, heavy-duty machinery also made some very tender movements.” Jashi came to film-making late, after being argued out of it as a girl by her engineer father and English teacher mother. “It was the 1990s during the post-Soviet crisis. We had no food, no electricity and no money, obviously. And they said: ‘No, you won’t make a living in film-making, plus you are a woman. You should study journalism. This is the profession of the future.’ So I kind of complied with that.” But news formats frustrated her and she started making short films, eventually winning a British Council scholarship to study for an MA at Royal Holloway, University of London, under the documentary-maker Gideon Koppel. “The kind of film I make now is very much because of him,” she says. “I didn’t even know they existed before.” Taming the Garden is far from a balanced two-minute news report; it stands at the junction of documentary and myth, not even mentioning that Ivanishvili’s garden is now open to the public. Although many trees were involved in the filming, their stories are represented by one symbolic journey. Villagers gather with their bicycles to see the tree on its way. A man lights his first cigarette in 30 years. An elderly woman weeps and convulsively crosses herself, while her younger relatives excitedly record the removal on their phones. As the tree is sailed along the coast – in a repeat of the image that inspired the film – two bulldozers await it on a stone mole, their excavator arms lowered like bowed heads at a funeral. And in a rich man’s manicured garden, round the half-buried roots of ancient trees held upright by guy ropes, the sprinklers come on. Taming the Garden is in cinemas from 28 January.",Arts/Film,Root of the problem: the brutal creation of a billionaire’s pleasure garden,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/14/root-of-the-problem-the-brutal-creation-of-a-billionaires-pleasure-garden
