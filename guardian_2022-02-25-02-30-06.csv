2/25/2022,"Fan service has come a long way since 2006, when studio New Line allowed its audience to basically crowd-think the entirety of Samuel L Jackson action epic Snakes on a Plane. Back then, somebody high up thought it would be a really good idea to start borrowing lines for Jackson to say (while fighting off those airborne reptiles) from a hyped-up geek community who had been spending most of their spare time discussing the unreleased movie on fan forums and blogs. The best/worst of them ended up being the legendary (for all the wrong reasons) line: “Enough is enough! I have had it with these motherfucking snakes on this motherfucking plane!” Up there with Jackson’s famous Ezekiel 25:17 speech about the path of the righteous man it really wasn’t. This week Marvel and Sony have shown how to do fan service properly. And all it took was a staged meme featuring all three webslingers from global megasmash Spider-Man: No Way Home pointing at each other. The image recalls a famous still from episode 19 of the 1967-1970 animated Spider-Man show, in which a Spidey-impostor – clue, he’s really a criminal – tries to impersonate the masked wallcrawler. It’s since been used millions of times in social media posts, often to illustrate moments when celebrities meet each other (according to the Know Your Meme website).  The staged meme was shot to publicise the digital release date of No Way Home on 22 March, and tapping into fans’ nostalgia for old Spider-Man shows couldn’t be more fitting. Ultimately, Jon Watts’s film, which recently overtook Avatar to become the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the all-important US box office, is 148 minutes of incredibly well-conceived and detailed Spidey fan-service. There are returning villains we thought we’d never see on the big screen again, such as Willem Dafoe’s cackling Green Goblin and Alfred Molina’s tragic Doc Ock. There are three Spider-Men from different eras, two of whom make such a welcome return that it’s like meeting a dear old friend again for a beer after decades apart. Marvel and Sony got this so right that there is now talk of future movies starring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as Spidey. We will surely see Dafoe as the Green Goblin again, if the creatives out there have their heads screwed on properly. And there will be more old superheroes returning from the dead in forthcoming DC effort The Flash, in which we are promised the return of the Michael Keaton and Ben Affleck takes on Batman. It would almost be a shock if Warner Bros hasn’t been desperately reaching out to George Clooney to make an appearance, though it is obviously a little bit harder to play off nostalgia when nobody much liked your version of the caped crusader in the first place. pic.twitter.com/NDS0m5mMrT But if fan service can be such a vital element of a good comic book movie, how do we explain Zack Snyder’s Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, a DC episode concocted almost entirely so that people would head into the cinema in their droves to see the dark knight battle the last son of Krypton? This is, after all, a film that almost singlehandedly killed off Warner Bros’s plans for a Marvel-style cinematic universe. Perhaps the secret here, if Hollywood really wants to keep comic book fans happy, is to build stories that allow them to fall in love with their favourite superheroes all over again, rather than one that requires transforming one of the most loved superheroes of all time, Batman, into a gun-toting, meat-headed bully just because certain filmgoers want to see him get knocked out with heat vision while they munch on their caramel-drenched popcorn. It’s a lesson well worth learning for the men in suits. Otherwise, come press time, they might just find there’s a whole lot of studio bods suddenly pointing accusing fingers at each other, for entirely the wrong reasons.",Arts/Film,The Spider-Man pointing meme perfectly encapsulates why fans adored No Way Home ,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/24/the-spider-man-pointing-meme-perfectly-encapsulates-why-fans-adored-no-way-home
2/25/2022,"The UK government has been criticised for its “toothless” use of the sanctions regime, as campaigners raised concerns that the enforcement body set up in 2016 to patrol breaches has only ever issued only six fines worth a combined £21m. As the government announces a fresh wave of sanctions against Russia after the invasion of Ukraine on Thursday, opposition politicians and campaigners warned that the UK’s failure to take action against existing suspected sanctions breaches “undermines any real deterrent value that UK sanctions could have”.  The Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI), set up in 2016 by then chancellor George Osborne to act as a “centre of excellence for financial sanctions”, handed down just one fine in the year to the end of March 2021 despite investigating 132 suspected breaches. By comparison, the US authorities issued 87 fines worth more than $1.5bn (£1.1bn) in a single year. Susan Hawley, executive director of campaign group Spotlight on Corruption, said: “The OFSI’s very low enforcement rate and the very low average fine level make OFSI look pretty toothless, and undermine any real deterrent value that UK sanctions could have.” “The OFSI lacks the kind of aggressive and proactive attitude to enforcement that would make the UK’s financial, accounting and legal sectors really sit up and take sanctions breaches seriously.” She warned that the lack of any criminal enforcement action over sanction breaches raises “real questions as to whether UK sanctions are actually be enforced properly at all”. Hawley highlighted the UK’s failure to act when a private jet targeted by sanctions against Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarus’s autocratic leader and ally of Putin, landed at Luton airport earlier this year. The 13-seater Embraer Legacy jet was one of six aircraft listed by then foreign secretary Dominic Raab last year in sanctions aimed at Lukashenko. The lack of enforcement action by the OFSI comes despite its latest annual report showing the total value of sanction breaches reported to the department in the year to March 2020 totalled £982m. That was a near fourfold increase on the value of reported breaches a year earlier. Hawley said the OFSI’s track record appeared shockingly weak compared to the US’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which has issued 87 fines worth a combined $1.53bn since 2021. David Lammy, the shadow foreign secretary, said the government must urgently explain why the OFSI had issued so few fines. He said the figures “show how government incompetence is contributing to the steady stream of dirty money from Russia and other authoritarian regimes flooding into the City of London”. A No 10 spokesperson said: “We certainly expect the sanctions to be met and we have done a lot of work with the Treasury in ensuring there is an impact. We want these sanctions to have an impact and will listen to views about how we do this.” HM Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.",News/Politics,UK accused of being ‘toothless’ in sanctions enforcement,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/feb/24/uk-sanctions-enforcement-toothless-russia-deterrent
2/25/2022,"The UK will impose its “largest ever” set of economic sanctions on Russia, including pushing to end Russia’s use of the Swift international payment systems, freezing assets of all major Russian banks, limiting cash held by Russian nationals in UK banks and sanctioning more than 100 individuals and entities. Boris Johnson has urged European leaders to agree that Russia’s use of the major payments system should be suspended, making the argument in a call with the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and in a meeting of G7 leaders. The move is likely to be resisted by EU countries.  Announcing a package of sanctions which Johnson had promised would “hobble” Russia’s economy, the PM said legislation would be laid on Tuesday to ban major Russian companies from raising finance on UK markets and to prevent Russia raising sovereign debt on UK markets. The sanctions include more key oligarchs who will have assets frozen, though sources said that more names – including what they said would be more recognisable figures – would be released in the coming weeks. The prime minister announced 10 measures the UK was taking immediately. The UK will freeze assets of all major Russian banks including VTB, the country’s second largest bank with assets totalling £154bn. Individual sanctions will be imposed on over 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries, including Rostec, the country’s biggest defence company, which exports £10bn in arms a year, as well as four other defence companies. Oligarchs who will be sanctioned include Putin’s former son-in-law Kirill Shamalov, Russia’s youngest billionaire; Denis Bortnikov, the chair of VTB Bank management board; and Yury Slyusar, the director of the United Aircraft Corporation. The Russian airline Aeroflot will be banned from landing in the UK The UK will suspend and prohibit all dual-use export licences to Russia, which covers items that could have civilian or military use. There will also be legislation to prohibit a wide range of hi-tech exports to Russia, including semi-conductors, aircraft parts such as Rolls Royce jet engines, and oil refinery equipment. Number 10 said it would set out more detail in the coming days about new legislation to limit the deposits that all Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts, intended to choke off the ability of Russians to raise finance and keep their money in London. Number 10 said it would extend a full range of measures to Belarus, which Russian forces have used to invade Ukraine, treating the country as subject to same sanctions regime as Russia. The final measure was a pledge to bring forward the economic crime bill, before Easter recess, aimed at making assets more transparent. Johnson had faced criticism from across the political spectrum earlier this week for introducing a package of sanctions many MPs, including in his own party, felt were too weak. They included sanctions on five Russian banks, including those with links to the defence sector, and three individuals closely associated with Vladimir Putin. Earlier the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, Tom Tugendhat, suggested the limited sanctions announced on Monday may have encouraged the Russian president. “What that did, I’m afraid, was it didn’t deter, but encouraged, because it gave the suggestion or made clear that we weren’t willing to do anything serious,” Tugendhat told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. EU ambassadors met in Brussels on Thursday afternoon to discuss a major package of sanctions across the financial and energy sectors including export controls on key components. The announcement followed an acrimonious meeting in Whitehall between the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin. Truss ended the meeting early, according to sources, who said Kelin “spouted the usual propaganda” but that Truss was “having none of it” and told him he “should be ashamed of himself”. The source added that the foreign secretary had told Kelin the international community would “rally around Ukraine” and that Russia had turned itself into “an international pariah”. Some Conservative MPs called for the UK to increase military aid to Ukraine, including the former cabinet minister David Davis, who said the UK should consider providing air support to the Ukrainian armed forces. Davis said that even the most “ferocious sanctions … are no longer a deterrent, they are a punishment” and that the invasion of Ukraine meant Vladimir Putin had “effectively declared war on the west”. Alicia Kearns, a Conservative MP and former senior communications officer at the Ministry of Defence, said Britain providing defensive support in Ukrainian airspace should be “on the table and under discussion”. 1. An asset freeze all major Russian banks, including VTB, the country’s second-largest bank, with assets of £154bn. 2. Legislation will be introduced to parliament on Tuesday, which will prohibit the ability of all major Russian companies to raise finance on UK markets, and for the Russian state raise sovereign debt on UK markets. The aim is to pass the legislation in one day. 3. A set of individual sanctions totalling over 100 individuals, entities and subsidiaries, when also counting the measures unveiled on Tuesday. The new targets include the Russian state-owned defence giant Rostec, its subsidiaries, and a group of oligarchs seen as particularly close to the Kremlin. These are: Kirill Shamalov: Russia’s youngest billionaire, and Vladimir Putin’s former son-in-law. Petr Fradkov: head of Promsvyazbank, one of the banks sanctioned, and the son of the former head of Russia’s FSB intelligence service. Denis Bortnikov: chairman of VTB bank. Yury Slyusar: head of Russia’s United Aircraft Corporation. Elena Georgieva: board chair of Novikombank. More people will be named in the weeks to come. The individuals will be banned from all UK transactions – meaning those with children in UK private schools will be unable to pay future fees. Relatives will not, however, be sanctions personally. 4. Immediately ban the ability of Russian airline Aeroflot to land in the UK. 5. Immediately, a suspension of all dual-use export licences to Russia. This covers items which could have a civilian or military use, such as electrical components and truck parts. 6. In the coming days, legislation to prohibit a wide range of hi tech exports, and the export of equipment connected to extracting oil and gas. This is being done in alliance with the US. 7. Looking into a way to limit the amount of deposits Russian nationals can hold in UK bank accounts. The details have to be decided, and also whether this will cover dual nationals. 8. A plan to work with allies to shut off Russia’s access to the Swift international bank system. This would have a major impact but can only be done effectively if other countries agree. 9. Extending the full range of sanctions to Belarus, given the integration of military between the nations. 10. The UK’s economic crime bill, which will strengthen areas such as unexplained wealth orders, will be brought forward. On Wednesday Boris Johnson had told MPs the bill would not be brought to the Commons this parliamentary session.",News/World news,Boris Johnson announces ‘largest ever’ set of sanctions against Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/24/boris-johnson-announces-largest-ever-set-of-sanctions-against-russia
2/25/2022,"Though best known for his Horrortorio pastiche and the “pop cantata” Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo, Joseph Horovitz, who has died aged 95, was a master craftsman in a range of music genres, extending from chamber and orchestral through brass band and wind to opera and ballet. He also wrote at least 70 television and film scores over the course of his career, including that for Rumpole of the Bailey. Many of his more serious works displayed a popular touch, too, but he consistently succeeded in writing music that was gratifyingly accessible without superficiality or sentimentality.  He began to achieve critical acclaim in the 1950s for two comic operas, The Dumb Wife, with a libretto by Peter Shaffer after Rabelais, and Gentleman’s Island, and for a series of ballets (he wrote 16 in all) beginning with Les Femmes d’Alger (1952) and continuing with Alice in Wonderland (1953) and Concerto for Dancers (1958). The former were performed by the Intimate Opera Company, for which he acted as a pianist-composer. In 1961 he was appointed professor of composition at the Royal College of Music, becoming a fellow in 1981 and continuing to teach there until shortly before his death. Horovitz once cited the British composers Peter Warlock, EJ Moeran and Frederick Delius, as well as the Anglo-Dutch Bernard van Dieren, as influences, but notwithstanding occasional echoes of Warlock, there are few significant traces of English pastoralism in his works. Rather he developed an individual neoclassical idiom, drawing on neo-tonal harmonies, enlivened by jazz, Latin American and other popular elements. The Trumpet Concerto (1963), written, according to Horovitz, to “demonstrate the agility and brilliance of the modern trumpet”, contrasts spiky, virtuoso material with indulgently mellifluous writing. The closing rondo – a favoured form of the composer – is spiced with Latin American rhythms that keep both soloist and orchestra on their toes. With its colourful orchestration including tambourine, side drum and xylophone, it affords an attractively good-humoured as well as challenging staple in the trumpet repertory. Originally associated with Philip Jones, who gave the first performance under the composer, it was subsequently recorded by a leading trumpeter of the succeeding generation, James Watson. Horovitz made similar contributions to the concerto repertory of many other instruments, too, including violin, clarinet, bassoon, percussion, tuba and euphonium. Probably his best-known work, Captain Noah and His Floating Zoo, written in 1968, was composed to a text by Michael Flanders. Performed by the King’s Singers, it won the Novello prize for the best children’s work and was set as a GCSE text. It was also adapted as a television cartoon and reorchestrated by the composer for a large-scale BBC performance in 2018, conducted by John Wilson, one of Horowitz’s many distinguished pupils. Almost as successful was the Horrortorio, first performed at the Hoffnung astronautical music festival of 1961 at the Royal Festival Hall, and subsequently all over the world. Setting a witty libretto by Alistair Sampson, from a scenario by Maurice Richardson that lampoons Hammer horror films of the period with its storyline populated by Count Dracula, Frankenstein, Moriarty and Fu Manchu, the Horrortorio is a riotous but skilfully crafted pastiche of Handelian oratorio, Gilbert and Sullivan and Walton’s Belshazzar’s Feast. Horovitz was born in Vienna to Béla Horovitz, a publisher and co-founder of Phaidon Press, and his wife, Lotte (nee Beller). Escaping from the city just days after the Nazi annexation of Austria in 1938, he travelled alone to London with his siblings, joined later by their parents. They spent the war years in Bath and Oxford. His elder sister, Elly Miller, became a distinguished art publisher, his younger sister, Hannah Horovitz, a classical music promoter. After reading music and modern languages at Oxford he studied with Gordon Jacob at the Royal College of Music and for a year with Nadia Boulanger in Paris. His first post as music director for the Bristol Old Vic provided both valuable experience – he continued to conduct throughout his life – and a grounding in the popular styles that were to become an intrinsic element in his own idiom. His Jazz Harpsichord Concerto (1965), using a concertino of amplified harpsichord, drums and bass, was a curiously idiosyncratic work for a professor at the RCM to write in the mid-60s, but its skilful blend of classical and jazz procedures, and its infectious, foot-tapping enthusiasm, give it immense audience appeal. The last of his five string quartets, dating from 1969, one of his finest works, uses gritty dissonance seemingly to recall the harsh experiences of his earlier life, with anguish forcefully invoked by insistent repetitions of Viennese waltz motifs. The disquiet alternates with wistful passages, however, and the quartet achieves a peaceful resolution on to a final consonance. He composed the score for The Search for the Nile (1971), a miniseries, for a BBC production of The Picture of Dorian Gray (1976), for Lillie, a TV series about Lillie Langtry starring Francesca Annis (1978), and for Rumpole of the Bailey (1978). The Jubilee Toy Symphony (1977), deploying toy instruments, bird sounds and percussion, was another popular success. Commissioned for the Queen’s silver jubilee, it was given its premiere by a stellar lineup of soloists under Colin Davis at a musical party in aid of the Musicians Benevolent Fund (now Help Musicians) at St James’s Palace, in the presence of the Queen Mother. In the 1980s he composed music for the TV series Agatha Christie’s Partners in Crime and A Dorothy L Sayers Mystery. A third opera, Ninotchka, based on the 1939 MGM film starring Greta Garbo, dates from 2006. He is survived by his wife, Anna (nee Landau), whom he married in 1956, and their two daughters, Isabel and Sally, six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

2/25/2022,"Two former European leaders have quit the boards of Russian companies in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Finland’s former prime minister Esko Aho said he had resigned as a director of Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank, while the former Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi announced he had quit the board of Russia’s largest car-sharing service, Delimobil.  Their departures highlighted the pressure on western business leaders and politicians to reassess their ties with Russian companies after Moscow’s full-scale attack on its neighbour. Aho, who was an independent director of Sberbank, had been a member of the lender’s supervisory board since 2016. He told the Finnish newspaper Turun Sanomat on Thursday morning that he had “initiated measures to withdraw from the board”. A page on Sberbank’s website showing Aho’s board positions was updated on Thursday. It stated he was “considered to have retired from the supervisory board … upon a personal request”. Italian media reported that Renzi, who remains the leader of the Italia Viva party, had stepped down from the board of directors of Delimobil. The former prime minister had taken up the position last August at the car-sharing firm, which was founded in 2015 by the Italian businessman Vincenzo Trani, the president of the Italian-Russian chamber of commerce. The resignations will increase the criticism of prominent former European politicians who have not cut their ties with Russian corporations, including the former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder. At the beginning of February, Schröder was nominated to join the board of the Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom. Schröder, who led Germany from 1998 to 2005, remains the chairman of the Russian state energy firm Rosneft, and also sits on the shareholders’ committee at Nord Stream, the company behind the controversial gas pipeline linking Russia and Germany. The former Social Democrat chancellor has come in for frequent criticism since leaving office for his close ties with Russia, and his personal friendship with Vladimir Putin. Schröder issued a statement on Thursday calling for caution in the use of sanctions against Russia, saying they could endanger a return to peace and dialogue. “Much has been said in recent years about mistakes and failures in the relationship between the west and Russia. And there were many mistakes – on both sides,” Schröder wrote on his page on the networking website LinkedIn. “But Russia’s security interests also do not justify the use of military means.” Schröder sits on the board of Rosneft alongside the former Austrian foreign affairs minister Karin Kneissl, as well as western business leaders including the current and former chief executives of BP, Bernard Looney and Bob Dudley.

2/25/2022,"I read with interest your editorial (21 February) regarding buy-to-let landlords and the injustice faced by renters who are excluded from the prosperity generated by rising property prices and who are funding the comfortable retirements of their landlords. While the suggestion of extending the right-to-buy scheme to the private sector is, at first glance, interesting, sadly this will not assist those who will never be able to afford to purchase a property. How will an individual receiving the minimum wage be able to afford the deposit required by a mortgage lender? Given that the average mortgage is repaid over 25 years, anyone over the age of 40 is likely to be excluded.  All political parties have avoided the fact that there is a chronic shortage of social housing. The Thatcher administration’s prohibition of local authorities using funds gained from former council tenants who purchased their properties to build new council-owned homes was shortsighted and caused incalculable social harm. The right to a permanent home is a basic human right and a cross-party issue. Will Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer be willing to accept, and promote, the fact that the only solution to the shortage is the largest programme of social housing construction since the end of the second world war?Keeley-Jasmine CavendishLondon  You put the shocking rise in house prices down to a lack of stock coming on to the market. How refreshing that you recognise that this is not due to a shortage of physical homes, but to the rich hoarding homes and to frenetic housebuilding drawing the eye of investors. Here in south Oxfordshire, the government forces us to build three times more homes than the number of households expected to form, that is, two newly empty dwellings for every one that becomes a home. This has turbocharged the market and prices. Concreting over our land loses us Oxford’s green belt and fragments the landscape. Land lost cannot be restored for nature and regenerative farming. The Labour party’s intention to ban foreign ownership of new homes should be extended to all homes and further localised: you cannot buy a home in Oxfordshire (old or new) unless you are, or intend to become, a resident. All homes should be sold for residential purposes only, slowly ending the problem of housing for investment. Some holiday businesses could be enabled by licensing premises for that purpose. This may sound draconian, but it is the only way we can bring down prices and house our people well. Limit the market, do not increase supply.Dr Sue RobertsDistrict councillor, South Oxfordshire  The housing shortage goes back to the Thatcher years and the privatisation of rentals. When she tried to make every tenant Conservative by pushing people to buy their council houses, she left a hole for councils, which she made sure could not be filled with the reductions on the amount that they could charge and the government subsidies that they could draw on. A lot of rough sleepers and plenty of tenants could surely be housed by local authorities – the biggest obstacle is the ideology of the present government.David CritchlowPoole, Dorset  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/25/2022,"Caoimhín Kelleher is a John Achterberg project, according to Jürgen Klopp, in the sense that Liverpool’s goalkeeping coach was convinced the “skinny boy from Ireland standing in this big goal” had first-team potential when others harboured doubts. Another Achterberg project is the goalkeeper mural at Liverpool’s Axa training centre, a work he commissioned from the local artist John Culshaw to commemorate those with a hand in shaping the club’s history – from Elisha Scott to Tommy Lawrence, Ray Clemence to Bruce Grobbelaar, Jerzy Dudek to Alisson – and which decorates a wall behind the keepers’ training area.  It is an ambition of Kelleher’s to marry the Achterberg projects together. “There are absolute legends up on that wall so to be up there would be an honour for me,” the 23-year-old says. “It would be quite cool and special if I was there. It is nice when you go training every day to be having a look at that. It is cool that we have a chance to win a trophy and maybe I can get myself on there as well. It is a good inspiration for us when we are training every day in front of it.” Kelleher will have his chance to win a trophy and press claims for a place on the mural – there remains space for an addition or two – in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Chelsea. The Republic of Ireland international will make his eighth appearance of the season, and 17th of his Anfield career, when Liverpool attempt to win their first domestic cup in a decade. The Carabao Cup is Kelleher’s dedicated competition this season and has demonstrated why the young talent has overtaken Adrián as Klopp’s second-choice keeper. After two penalty saves in the quarter-final shootout win over Leicester he was unflappable in the semi-final second leg win at Arsenal – in keeping with a laid-back personality – but discovered he would be playing at Wembley only when Klopp was asked his intentions at a press conference the following day. “My idea is to play him,” the Liverpool manager said. “Caoimhín deserves that. He brought the team there.” Kelleher recalls: “That was nice to hear. I didn’t know if I would be playing the final, not even when I was playing most of the games. I would never want to take anything for granted. I was obviously very happy. It is an honour to represent Liverpool in a final. I always had belief that I could get up to the first team but this is still a really nice moment for me.” A Liverpool fan from childhood in Cork, Kelleher was a prolific striker for the county and for Ringmahon Rangers until he was 13. Three of his four brothers play hurling (the other, Fiacre, is a defender for Bradford City) but there was no temptation to follow suit. “I tried a bit of GAA but for me it was just football,” Kelleher says. “It was the only one I was good at.” He switched from Ringmahon’s leading goalscorer to goalkeeper when their regular stopper left. “Obviously it has worked out well,” he says, with considerable understatement. “I did OK in the first game but it was more that I really enjoyed playing in the position. I took a love to it and kicked on. Maybe six to eight months after becoming a goalkeeper clubs would come looking and wanting to take me on trial.” Blackburn, Aston Villa and Manchester United were interested. When Liverpool called, however, there was only one place he was going. “I have had belief in myself since I came over that I can do it but it has taken a lot of hard work and a lot of coaching sessions to bring me on,” Kelleher says. “I have a lot to thank John for in that respect. Ever since I came here he has been brilliant with me. He saw something in me since I came into first-team training and he brought me on in leaps and bounds. I know for sure I would not be here if it was not for him. “I am nowhere near the highest level yet – I think I have a long way to go if I want to reach that – but I’ve always had belief in myself that I can play here and obviously playing games for the first team and performing relatively well gives you the extra boost of confidence that you are good enough. Now I need to push on and keep going.” Kelleher has been to Wembley once, for the Republic of Ireland’s friendly defeat by England in November 2020, and claims he will feel more excitement than nerves in the buildup to a final attended by his family and girlfriend. He prefers to listen to music than re-analyse opposition strikers before kick-off and, though his relaxed character appears well-equipped to handle pressure, Kelleher’s manager has removed it from him anyway. Klopp says: “If it works out, then it’s all about Caoimhín. If it doesn’t work out, then it’s all about me. It’s as easy as that, and I take it. It’s just a thing we have to do because of the quality Caoimhín has. We want to keep him as long as somehow possible knowing that, from our point of view, the best goalkeeper in the world is our No 1. Caoimhín is an exceptional goalkeeper and we want to keep him here. And for that, he needs games. These games are his competition, and there’s no chance of him not playing.”",Sport/Football,Caoimhín Kelleher: from childhood striker to Liverpool’s cup final keeper,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/24/caoimhin-kelleher-liverpool-carabao-cup-final-goalkeeper
2/25/2022,"I was intrigued by Dr Clare Gerada’s long read (‘In my 30 years as a GP, the profession has been horribly eroded’, 22 February). I left general practice in late 1990, a few months before Dr Gerada began her own distinguished career. The changes she so graphically describes were incipient even then. The personal, responsive and resilient service provided by a dedicated and stable workforce was already under threat. The shift to an impersonal gig economy has been driven by inexorable consumer demand, untempered by any significant response from the profession.  It is my opinion that the General Medical Council and Royal College of General Practitioners could have done far more to retain the ethical, personal and accessible services threatened by the intrusive and bureaucratic contracts of 1990 and 2004.

I too was a GP in south London, but from 1962 until 1996. In the early days, I had a highly visible yellow Renault 4 and would often come out from Safeways to a small queue of people by the car asking for a repeat prescription “to save an appointment, doctor”. These I would cheerfully give as I knew everyone and they had a point. There was no appointment system at the surgery, but numbered cards on hooks in the hall meant you could nip out to do a bit of shopping while waiting. The absence of technology meant the art of diagnosis – as it was called – was vital. We were taught in the Royal Free medical school to “listen to the patient – they are telling you the diagnosis”, and I hope I always used that wisely.Dr Margaret TaylorClare, Suffolk  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/25/2022,"French politicians have long embraced domestic animals – from Emmanuel Macron’s rescue dog, Nemo, who once peed on a fireplace during an Elysée meeting, to the far-right leader Marine Le Pen’s hobby of breeding Bengal cats. But a dog called Douglas from the south of France is causing ridicule for the rightwing presidential candidate Valérie Pécresse.  The dog, which lives in Nice on the Côte d’Azur, was allegedly signed up to vote in the primary race that chose Pécresse as the candidate for Les Républicains, according to an investigation by the daily newspaper Libération. The paper said it had seen confidential party membership lists for the December primary, and among the 148,000 party members signed up for the vote journalists had found names of at least four deceased people and one dog. “Douglas was a discreet party activist,” wrote Libération. “After paying €30 online in November, he received a membership card and the right to vote in the primary. No one saw him at meetings and he never commented on the campaign on social media – for the very good reason that Douglas is a dog.” Libération said it had contacted Douglas’s owner, who confirmed that he had signed up the animal with his own contact details “to see if it was possible”. Pécresse said she knew nothing of the dog’s alleged presence and denied any irregularities in the primary campaign, which she said had been “exemplary” and had never been challenged. She said the paper’s investigation was a “grotesque act of manipulation and destabilisation” and that any primary might have had the odd prank. In a statement, the party denied all the allegations and said it would make a legal complaint against Libération. But it was too late to stem the tide of dog jokes flooding social media aimed at Pécresse, particularly among the digital campaigners of her rival, the far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour. Zemmour, who has convictions for incitement to racial hatred, is known for both his thunderous speeches about the decline of France and his mocking of his opponents. His supporters seized on Douglas and soon the hashtag #Douglasgate was trending in France. One Parisian Zemmour supporter posted a video of a recent Pécresse speech in which she told party members, “At last we’re all united”, and superimposed footage of a pack of hunting hounds. Woof#douglas #wouf #ValerieDetresse pic.twitter.com/ngw5YJfXSS Zemmour himself tweeted that his new Reconquête party was the first to officially allow pets to join as supporters, “but they aren’t allowed to vote”. Reconquête! est le premier parti qui autorise l’inscription de vos animaux de compagnie !NB : vous pouvez les inscrire mais ils ne pourront pas voter.#douglasgate #LesAnimauxAvecZemmour https://t.co/hluOVJuMoa Douglas soon had his own Twitter account. pic.twitter.com/mS7MNgC5tH Journalists at the paper Nice-Matin claimed to have hunted down the real Douglas the dog, which had been given a false name by Libération to protect his owner. The paper said that the canine was in fact a Shiba Inu living in Nice named Clovis. Polls this week have shown Macron ahead in the first-round vote, followed by Le Pen and Zemmour, with Pécresse slipping slightly behind them and the hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon trailing her.

2/25/2022,"In asking for a special review of the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s “A” rating as a regulator (LGBT+ groups call for EHRC to lose international status over trans stance, 11 February), Stonewall is trying to undermine the only regulator we have that is invested in securing human rights and equality for all in the UK. The EHRC’s chair is right to point out that its task is to balance the rights of all and not any one group. Stonewall’s insistence on misrepresenting the EHRC’s views and on “speaking for all” in the quest for gaining rights for trans people is misguided. Rights and freedoms are not entitlements; they are negotiated with others before the law through honest and often impassioned debate.  The EHRC knows better than most that all equalities are connected. If hate crimes take place against an individual from one group, it will also take place against others in other groups. We also know that most of us have identities that mean we want equality for several, not just one identity. Stonewall’s task is to bring people together to address these difficult issues, to support the EHRC, even if it wants to take it to task, and to build alliances with other key equality groups, not to bully them into submission. Fighting for equality has become toxic at a time when we need our equality leaders to protect existing rights and not demolish them in the name of one particular equality.Elaine WillisFormer chair, Stonewall  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

2/25/2022,"With Kim Kardashian in the front row and her half sister Kendall Jenner on the catwalk – a resurgent Prada is flexing its muscles, as the big hitters of Italian fashion jostle for position in the post-pandemic era. With Gucci returning to the city’s fashion week for the first time since February 2020 and Giorgio Armani, who cancelled two January events during the Omicron surge, throwing his hat back into the ring with two shows, the competitive edge has returned to Milan’s catwalks.  Miuccia Prada, ever the maverick of this group, has declared herself tired of fashion history. She cares about “the history of women, the history of people, not the history of fashion”, she said before Thursday’s show. Simple Marlon Brando-style white cotton vests turned up in no less than 15 of the catwalk looks, while a pair of cotton pyjamas with the show address printed on the breast pocket served as the invitation for the event. The concept: a celebration of intimate, everyday clothes that don’t scream status or glamour. But Prada has always delighted in contradictions and the showstopper tailored coats embellished with pastel feathers on the upper sleeve – a captain’s armband, but make it cocktail – pointed to plenty of fashion ambition. Now a design partnership in which Miuccia Prada shares design duties with Raf Simons, the label’s retail sales were up 18% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with the same period in 2019. Prada’s husband and business partner, Patrizio Bertelli, recently indicated that a succession plan was in place to hand over the reins of the company to their son, Lorenzo, within the next five years.  The job of fashion, Simons believes, is “to define our idea of beauty today”. In its mashup of the lo-fi (cotton vests and nylon parkas) and the ultra-glamorous (Kardashians and feather trims), this collection was Prada doing what it does best: using fashion to hold a mirror to the contradictions of how we live now. The show was dotted with Prada in-jokes. The famous triangle logo twinkled from the toes of shoes and at the collar of an evening dress, while the skirt-and-sweater as a look – a staple of Prada greatest hits and of Miuccia’s own wardrobe – made several catwalk turns. Ian Griffiths, the British designer of MaxMara, cast models of a range of body sizes and ages to wear autumn’s teddy bear fake fur coats and ultra wide-leg trousers at his show. “I want to create a rapport with the woman watching, who should see herself reflected in the catwalk. I want to hold up a mirror and say – yes, this is aspirational, but it is also about you.” Backstage after the show, he said: “The days when designers would say, ‘I want to do a show with only blondes.’ I can’t imagine going back to that world now.” Griffiths added that the rise of Kate Moss, who challenged the orthodoxy that only very tall women could be successful catwalk models, “was the beginning of the end of a system, which I’m glad to say is now breaking down”.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Prada flexes its muscle with mashup of lo-fi and ultra-glamorous,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/feb/24/prada-flexes-muscles-mashup-lo-fi-ultra-glamourous-milan

2/25/2022,"Western leaders have spent the past 20 years trying to guess what Vladimir Putin “really wants”. Very often, it’s enough just to read his words, very carefully. Because usually he means exactly what he says. And in the case of his early morning television address announcing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, his words and hints about his intentions were truly terrifying. It would be good to start with his warning to the west not to interfere, because just as people like David Davis call for the west to provide air support to Ukraine, Putin had this to say: “Russia will respond immediately, and the consequences will be such as you have never seen in your entire history. All the necessary decisions in this regard have been taken.”  There can be little doubt that what he means is that he is prepared to deploy nuclear weapons against any country that takes military action to help Ukraine. He added, with great emphasis: “I hope that my words will be heard.” Apparently not by Davis. As for Putin’s intentions in Ukraine itself, there was a strong indication that he plans to incorporate the Donbas (including the entire Donetsk and Luhansk regions, most of which are still in Ukrainian hands) into the Russian Federation, just as he did with Crimea in 2014. He said that the peoples living in Ukraine (by which he meant the Russians) have the right to make a “free choice”, and added that in 2014 Russia “was obliged to protect the people of Crimea” and that those people then chose to “be with their historic homeland, Russia”. There is no other way to interpret those words than as a threat to annex the eastern regions of Ukraine. As for his declared intention to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine, it is hard to see how this could be achieved without a wholesale occupation of the country and change of government. True, Putin denied that his purpose was to occupy Ukraine. But there was a big “but”: there were, he said, “statements” coming from the west to the effect that there was no need any more to “abide by the documents setting forth the outcomes of world war two”. So it’s goodbye Yalta, it seems, as Putin sets about redrawing the map of Europe. So what hope is there that Putin can be deterred from going this far? Inside Russia, opposition voices have been utterly squashed. Politicians who might have led public protests, such as Alexei Navalny, are in prison, and his entire network of activists has been outlawed. Would-be protesters in Moscow were detained as soon as they left their flats. The editor of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov, who won last year’s Nobel peace prize, put out a desperately sad statement: “President Putin has ordered our country to start a war with Ukraine. And there is nobody to stop this war. For that reason, as well as grief, I feel shame.” Anyone who watched Monday’s meeting of Putin with his security council will understand Muratov’s despair. This was a gathering of those who in theory advise the president, whose job is to assess options and their outcomes. Not one of them dared step out of line. They knew what Putin wanted them to say and they said it. When the foreign intelligence chief, Sergei Naryshkin, fluffed his lines, he got a tongue-lashing (shown on TV) from the president. A couple of officials did suggest giving diplomacy a few days longer, but they were ignored. Dmitry Medvedev was seen as a flickering light of reason when he swapped the presidency with Putin in 2008-12, but on Monday he too fell into line. There is, literally, nobody in Russia who can stop this war, because Putin has total control. The ostensibly elected parliament – the Duma and the Federation Council – is full of his placemen. The presidential administration and the foreign ministry almost certainly contain doubters, people who might want to point out that invasion is hardly compatible with the president’s statements about Ukrainians and Russians being “one people”. But I would be astonished if any of them offered to resign. Can the west stop him? The history of sanctions, ever tougher and more far-reaching, is ignominious. Putin sneers at them, because he will always put his version of what Russia needs for its security above economic considerations. He also has a huge reserve fund to soften the blow. All wars end in either victory for one side or in a negotiated settlement. Today, the prospect of the latter appears bleak. I find it hard to comprehend why it would have been so wrong to agree to the negotiations Putin wanted last year, to seriously review Europe’s security system, if that had a chance of avoiding the war that has now begun. Surely a neutral Ukraine, safe between its neighbours, would be preferable to war. But the time for that is gone. Putin is now hell-bent on revenge for what he perceives as years of western slights. He alone will decide his neighbour’s fate. Angus Roxburgh is a former BBC Moscow correspondent and consultant to the Kremlin.

2/25/2022,"A juror in Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal trial who might not have disclosed childhood sexual abuse during jury selection for the high-profile case will now be questioned publicly as Maxwell’s team seeks a retrial, court papers released on Thursday said. Maxwell was found guilty on 29 December of sex trafficking and other related counts for coordinating disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor girls, some as young as 14.  Epstein, a convicted sex offender whose social circle was a roster of powerful and global figures, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking of teen girls. He killed himself about one month later in a Manhattan jail pending trial. Controversy over Juror No 50, who has identified himself in media interviews as Scotty David, unfolded shortly after Maxwell’s trial. David told journalists that he was sexually abused in childhood. David alleged that he told other panelists about this abuse – helping them view things from a victim’s point of view. Juror 50 will undergo questioning on 8 March, the papers said. “Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his own experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection,” Judge Alison Nathan wrote in a decision released Thursday. Nathan added: “Juror 50’s post-trial statements are ‘clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, non-speculative impropriety’ – namely, a false statement during jury selection – has occurred.” She said: “To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could be explored.” Nathan also said that she cannot make a decision on Maxwell’s request for a retrial solely based upon David’s statements in the press and so ruled that he be questioned in court. “The court therefore orders that a hearing take place at which the court will question Juror 50 under oath,” Nathan wrote. David’s statements about possible previous abuse spurred questions as then-prospective jurors filled out questionnaires during selection proceedings – which directly asked about sexual abuse. David maintained that he did not recall the question on abuse but said he had responded to every question honestly. Following David’s interviews, prosecutors requested that Nathan investigate his statements; Maxwell’s lawyers swiftly asked for a hearing and new trial.",News/US news,Key juror in Ghislaine Maxwell trial to be questioned under oath next month,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/24/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-juror-50-court-hearing
2/25/2022,"Late-night hosts were on edge on Wednesday afternoon, as Russia was poised to invade Ukraine. Hours after their tapings, they did – Putin ordered a “special military operation” in Ukraine and the Russian military began shelling various targets beyond the two eastern Russian-controlled territories they had previously claimed as independent.  In the run-up to one of the worst international crises since the second world war, though, Jimmy Kimmel trained his focus on Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who has been supportive of Russia’s military build-up along its border with Ukraine and especially of leader Vladimir Putin. “What is this really about?” Carlson said on his primetime show this week, in typical nonsense question style. “Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle class job in my town to Russia? Did he manufacture a worldwide pandemic that wrecked my business and kept me indoors for two years? Is he teaching my children to embrace racial discrimination? Is he making fentanyl? Is he trying to snuff out Christianity? Does he eat dogs? These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is no.” “I see, so in order for you to despise a man who murders his rivals, who murders and poisons people and who’s actively trying to destabilize our country, he has to do something to you personally,” Kimmel responded. “He has to eat your dog.” “I want to see the tape Putin has of him, because it has to be something special,” he added. “I mean seriously, how did we go from being a country that hated communism since well before I was born, how did we go from the country that made Red Dawn and Rocky IV to this? It boggles the mind. “Can you imagine Ronald Reagan turning on Fox News and hearing this?” he joked. Carlson, Kimmel acknowledged, “knows what he’s doing. He knows this is garbage he’s feeding these people who watch him. Between Tucker Carlson and Pam & Tommy, this really is the golden age of talking dicks on television.” “Tonight, you really get a vibe right now that the borscht is about to hit the fan,” said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show, as US intelligence pointed to an imminent full-scale invasion (which turned out to be correct within the evening). “Their first clue? The 190,000 troops with the bang-bang sticks and the all-steel shoot mobiles. That warning courtesy of the US state duh-partment,” he quipped. “No one doesn’t see what’s coming,” he continued, though the Kremlin has claimed that rebel leaders in eastern Ukraine have asked Russia with military help to fend off Ukrainian aggression. “Yes, they say Ukraine is the aggressor just like Tokyo is asking for it by taunting Godzilla,” Colbert said. In response to Russian aggression, the Ukrainian government declared a 30-day state of emergency that will, among other things, allow ordinary citizens to carry firearms. “That’s right, this situation is so dire, Ukraine has become Texas,” Colbert noted. Meanwhile, Joe Biden has imposed sanctions on Russia’s two largest banks and on the sons of two of Putin’s closest officials. “If he’s going after children of Putin’s cronies, can I suggest a couple?” Colbert said over a photo of Donald Trump’s sons Don Jr and Eric. “The entire world is aghast and horrified,” Seth Meyers said of an imminent Russian invasion on Late Night. “The only people who could possibly think this is a good move are those unemployed fringe weirdos who go on small-time radio shows. “You know, like this guy,” he continued, referring to Donald Trump’s appearance on a radio show in which he called Putin’s baseless recognition of two eastern Ukrainian regions as independent “genius”. “How smart is that?” Trump said of Putin’s unilateral decision. “You gotta say, that’s pretty savvy.” “No, you don’t ‘gotta say’ that,” Meyers retorted. “I mean, maybe you gotta say that so someone will pick you up at the Moscow airport when you flee our jurisdiction. “It’s just insane that Trump is still so desperate to praise a bloodthirsty tyrant like Putin every chance he gets,” he added. As for “all those war-mongers like Mike Pompeo and Newt Gingrich and the House Republicans” who have gone on to Fox News and declared Biden’s response “weak” – “your dude is the one who just called Putin savvy and praised his genius. Do you guys even pay attention to what Trump is saying anymore or do you just assume like most of us that he got lost wandering around the 18th hole of one of his golf courses and now he just lives in a sand trap with a bunch of pigeons.”",Arts/Culture,Kimmel on Tucker Carlson’s pro-Russia stance: ‘I want to see the tape Putin has of him’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/feb/24/late-night-jimmy-kimmel-tucker-carlson-pro-russia-stance
2/25/2022,"If Angel in Realtime is ostensibly an ode to David Le’aupepe’s late father, it reveals itself as a portrait of the son, passing back and forth between grief and searching and understanding, in his father’s wake. In the opening track, You in Everything, Le’aupepe asks of himself: “How do I face the world or raise a fucking kid/Or see beauty in the earth and all its majesty replete/When I’ve spent the better part of my 20s doing self-indulgent bullshit on repeat?” A dozen tracks later, as he contemplates “the sum of a life” in Goal of the Century, he hasn’t found an answer but the path to it looks a little brighter: “Head down I’m writing this shit out/On my phone/A way that I can talk to you/And reach you.”  The tenderness with which Le’aupepe speaks of his father, Tattersall, his two brothers (who he only discovered existed after his father’s death), his wife and ultimately of himself, is the defining feature of Gang of Youths’ third album. As a corollary, forgiveness underpins the emotional landscape he draws, though its components suggest it would not have been easy or guaranteed. It is not just forgiveness for his father, who left his first family in New Zealand to find work and made a new life and family in Australia (“Come find me/I’m here today but don’t belong/I’m working ’til the debt is gone”). It is also forgiveness for Le’aupepe’s younger self, who could have or should have said more and thought more. The full complexities of his father’s life, and the wash through several generations, ripple across the songs. The impression created is so vivid that imagined thoughts, like “In the instance of pain, I look straight down at the iris/If the irises fade/I spend days out in the yard/In the absence of rain”, feel truthful. Sure, we are only getting part of the story, but it feels rich with detail and provides the cornerstone to Le’aupepe’s own character, whose loves and second thoughts are chronicled in parallel. A father who abandoned one family and built another who knew nothing of the first, spinning a story of his own childhood that would only be exposed as a myth after his death. The older sons, who didn’t understand why they had been left; and the younger son, now dealing with the guilt of receiving that love the others didn’t get (“I accounted for the miles of attention/That I got but never want nor choose”), and fearing he’d wasted it. There is so much to tell. Would the only way to tell this story be to present it in an equally full, emotional and dramatic rock-as-done-by-sons-of-Springsteen fashion? That has been the Gang of Youths way until now. Well, experimentation is evident here, stylistically and instrumentally. There is early 2000s groove-conscious U2 in Tend the Garden, to balance the Eno-era yearning rock U2 found in Spirit Boy. The kinetic rhythm in Forbearance brings to mind the National, as the other side of the coin from, um, the National in The Man Himself’s euphoric chorus. But there’s not much in the way of structural experimentation, and definitely not sonically. For much of the album, air to breathe is rare, especially the longer the song goes. (Forbearance is a notable exception.) Mostly, sooner or later all the available room is filled with drum loops and live drums, guitars and synths, brass and choirs, strings and piano, marimba and woodwind, sampled voices and sounds of the Cook Islands and traditional Māori instruments. Certainly those songs perform their function: you may punch the air and twirl around the propulsive rhythms in songs like In the Wake of Your Leave and The Angel of 8th Avenue, delivered in the manner of a heartland rock band with the secret desire to be goths. Returner grows from a folkish heel-tapper to a singing-with-fans-in-the-terraces climax. And Unison is layered with tuned percussion, low brass and strings, until the drum loops override any remaining reticence and a Pasifika Bono brings us home. Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morning They make all the right moves, the effort writ clearly on the surface of everything, and undoubtedly those packed, hot room concerts will peak regularly with these anthems-in-waiting choruses. But – maybe whisper it – in repetition and volume, these big, bold songs are … perfectly fine. Instead it is the smaller songs that are the album’s standouts: like Brothers, where Le’aupepe hunches over a piano, almost singing to himself. Or Hand of God, which repeats that formula, except towards the end he is joined by gentle sounds of the Auckland Gospel Choir. The closing track, Goal of the Century, goes back and forth in its seven minutes between voice, piano and low-key strings, and full orchestration.

2/25/2022,"I’d never done a reverse park before, and in the empty train station car park, my instructor directed me to reverse in beside the only other car in the area – a grey van. Reverse parking is horrible. I don’t understand why anyone would do it when they can forward park. As I squeezed in beside the van (the equivalent of sitting right next to someone in an empty train carriage), I noticed a hand adjusting the curtains in the back window.  “Someone must be living in there,” I said to the instructor. I squeezed out, paid for the lesson, then walked to the station to get a train home to the next town. I noticed a person walking near me. It was the woman from the van. She would have been in her 70s, white hair, an old jumper and skirt, sandals. “That was my first reverse park!” I told her. “I’m going for my licence in eight weeks and if I don’t get it I will be the oldest learner driver in the world.” The woman smiled, then did something truly odd. She came close to me, held out her hand and said, “Take this.” She was trying to hand me a $50 note. Oh no. Please don’t. I once found a $50 note on the ground but no stranger had ever walked up out of the blue and tried to give me money. Particularly not someone who looked like they might need it themselves. “I’m good, thanks. But thank you very much. That’s very kind, but I don’t need the money.” “Please just take it,” she said. “Take it.” I took the money and felt a powerful charge. It seemed to be not just the exchange of cash between two strangers but like something important and elemental had taken place. But I was also baffled – and felt a bit guilty for accepting it. I sat waiting for the bus and started talking to the woman. She was from outback New South Wales and had travelled to central Victoria. She had tried to give money to other people – strangers – “but people don’t want to take it”. She mimed someone putting up their hands and backing away from her like she was crazy. But she just wanted to give people cash. I asked her why she gave money away to strangers and she said that giving made her happy, and that the secret to a good life was not to want more than you have. “If you are satisfied with what you’ve got, you’ll have a good life,” she said. “Too many people want what they don’t have, so they spend their whole life working so they can get the next thing. But that doesn’t make them happy – so they never get satisfied and they are always after more money to get the next thing that might make them happy.” “And it never stops,” I said, getting her drift. “The treadmill. The person is actually never satisfied. I guess that’s capitalism …” She nodded. “I’ve always been happy with what I’ve got – so I’ve never wanted more.” More was surplus, and so she gave away what she didn’t need. And she didn’t need the $50 because she had been sleeping in her van at the station for three nights and so had saved money from van park fees. “You can use the money for your next driving lesson,” she said. We sat in the sun and she told me a bit more about her life. She was travelling around Australia in her van – had been for a few years now – but was getting old, and she was finding being on the road more difficult as she aged. She avoided the big cities, took her time and travelled slow. “The most important thing is your health,” she told me. “You realise that when you get old. You can have all the money in the world but you can’t buy good health. You have to look after yourself. There’s no point having a lot of money if you make yourself sick and stressed trying to get it.” My bus came and we wished each other luck. She walked back towards her van, taking it slow. On the replacement bus service, I became completely undone. The day before I had come back from a three-day silent meditation retreat where for hours in the deep silence in a forest, in the high, clear air, I had money on my mind. I am lucky. I have more than enough – but sitting in silence for hours on end, money thoughts flooded through my mind and refused to recede. There was the car I would buy when I got my licence, and an expensive holiday I wanted, and Sydney property, Sydney property, Sydney property – the mantra that thrummed between my ears, all day, and into the night, when I was meant to be getting clear. Now, as the bus wound up the mountains, I couldn’t stop crying – but couldn’t really tell you why. What happened at the station didn’t feel like a random act of kindness, but something more akin to grace. The money transcended the material and had become totemic, carrying something in it – character, kindness, a way of being in the world that I see so infrequently that the encounter felt holy.",Opinion/Opinion,A stranger who lived in a van gave me money - and some incredible life advice | Brigid Delaney,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/25/a-stranger-who-lived-in-a-van-gave-me-money-and-some-incredible-life-advice
2/25/2022,"The most disadvantaged areas of Melbourne have been hit hardest by Covid-19 deaths during Victoria’s Omicron wave, further underscoring the pandemic’s disproportionate effect on communities with lower employment and income levels, and poorer access to services. Data obtained exclusively by Guardian Australia shows that in Melbourne’s most disadvantaged local government areas (LGAs), Covid deaths occurred at a rate of 26 deaths per 100,000 residents. This substantially outweighs deaths in areas of greater socio-economic advantage.  The local government areas of Brimbank, Greater Dandenong and Kingston accounted for 134 of the 943 Covid deaths in the state between 8 December 2021 and 21 February 2022. Brimbank is Victoria’s second-most disadvantaged LGA, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics’ index of relative socio-economic disadvantage (IRSD), which takes into account factors such as employment, income levels, access to education, services and more. It was also the hardest hit LGA overall in this period, with 65 deaths in total, that, when weighted for population, equates to 33.45 deaths for every 100,000 people. In Greater Dandenong, which ranks the lowest in terms of socio-economic indicators, 37 people died, which equates to 24.33 deaths per 100,000 people. George Disney, a social epidemiologist and research fellow from the University of Melbourne, told Guardian Australia the findings were “depressingly predictable”. “If you’re disadvantaged, you’re more likely to be exposed to the disease and you’re more likely to have worse health outcomes,” Disney said. Covid in Australia could be characterised as “a disease of disadvantage”, Disney said. Data released by the ABS last week showed that Covid deaths since the onset of the pandemic until the end of January this year have disproportionately affected migrant communities, with 6.8 deaths per 100,000 people born overseas, compared with 2.3 for those born in Australia. The 2016 census shows both Brimbank and Greater Dandenong have large numbers of migrants. Just 45% of the residents in Brimbank were born in Australia, and in Greater Dandenong the percentage is even lower, at 36%. Nationally, more than 66% of Australian residents were born here. A non-English language is spoken at home in more than 60% of households in both LGAs. The same is true for about 22% of households across Australia. Just over a third of the people in Victoria who died from Covid in the past three months – 327 people – lived in the 10 most disadvantaged areas of Melbourne, accounting for 34.67% of the overall deaths during the most recent wave of the pandemic. Five of those most disadvantaged LGAs – Brimbank, Casey, Whittlesea, Greater Dandenong and Hume – accounted for 240 deaths from Covid in this period. Disney said the results were unsurprising. He said the issue of workplace entitlements such as sick leave had still not been adequately addressed. “​​How are we two years into this and we don’t have universal sick pay? The isolation period will disappear – it’s happening overseas. The Covid-specific protections will go, and we’ll just be left with what we had previously. And there are so many people who don’t have protections from sickness,” he said. “We shouldn’t have been surprised that this happened with Covid because it happens with almost every other disease. It’s depressingly predictable. The government could have averted so many deaths if they’d focused on this.” Many of these areas have repeatedly suffered during the pandemic. Hume and Whittlesea were also among the Victorian LGA’s with the five highest death rates during the Delta wave. Hume, Casey, Brimbank and Whittlesea all have had some of the highest case numbers throughout the pandemic. In the middle of the Delta wave, Hume had already recorded more than 1,500 cases per 100,000 residents while more affluent areas of Melbourne had just 17. The Victorian Department of Health shared data on Covid deaths in 63 local government areas. Of these, 25 had fewer than five deaths during the Omicron wave. Almost 900 deaths were recorded in 39 LGAs – most of them in metropolitan Melbourne. Most of the LGAs with few deaths were in rural areas. Darebin in Melbourne’s north, where 51 people died from Covid, had the highest death rate during Omicron, at just over 34 deaths per 100,000 people. Darebin is ranked 13th lowest on the IRSD scale for Melbourne. The Darebin, Brimbank, Moreland, Monash and Macedon Ranges LGAs all recorded more than 25 deaths per 100,000 people. A report released last year by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found that in the first year of the pandemic there were nearly four times as many deaths in population groups of lower socio-economic status compared to those in the highest. Guardian Australia understands 37% of the people who died with Covid in Victoria during the Omicron wave had not received two doses of the vaccine, and about 33% were unvaccinated. A spokesperson for the Victorian Department of Health expressed sympathy for those who had lost loved ones and said: “The data is clear that getting your third dose will significantly reduce your chances of going to hospital, going to ICU or dying from Covid-19. The best thing Victorians can do to protect themselves from Covid-19 is to get their third dose as soon as they’re eligible.” The Guardian sought similar data from New South Wales but NSW Health did not provide it, nor could their representatives describe the methodology used for the publicly available breakdowns of areas in which deaths occurred.",News/Australia news,‘Disease of disadvantage’: Melbourne’s lower socioeconomic areas suffer most Covid deaths amid Omicron,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/disease-of-disadvantage-melbournes-lower-socioeconomic-areas-suffer-most-covid-deaths-amid-omicron
2/25/2022,"It could be argued that the NRL really understands how to build anticipation for its women’s game. That would, of course, be a very generous interpretation of the situation that has led to a 491-day break since the last time an NRLW game was played. The 2021 season, which was originally slated to take place in August and then pushed back to October, was moved to 2022 due to the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. NRL CEO Andrew Abdo said at the time that the delay offered an opportunity to commit to the women’s game completely in 2022.  “The rescheduling provides us with an opportunity to create a full 12-month calendar for women’s rugby league in 2022 and importantly means our athletes will not have to relocate,” he said. How that plays out remains to be seen, but there will be plenty of eyes on the sport to see how the women’s game is prioritised in a season that will undoubtedly still feel the effects of the pandemic. The reinvigorated competition has farewelled the New Zealand Warriors but welcomes three new teams to the fold – the Newcastle Knights, Parramatta Eels and Gold Coast Titans will make their NRLW debuts this weekend, alongside foundation clubs the St George Illawarra Dragons, Brisbane Broncos and Sydney Roosters. The new teams add some much-needed upheaval to the competition that has been dominated by the Broncos since its inception in 2018. No other team has claimed the premiership and Brisbane have won all three of their grand finals by margins of 10 points or more. The addition of new teams offers the opportunity for talent to be spread more evenly across the league and though the Broncos remain the firm favourites heading into this season, there is hope the competition will begin to even out over the next few years. The expansion of the competition also provides essential opportunities for more players to take the step up to the top level. Throughout its first three seasons, the NRLW had more talent than it could fit into its four teams, particularly when the 2020 competition featured the injection of a number of rugby sevens Olympians whose own tournaments had been cancelled due to the pandemic. While women and girls have had limited opportunities in rugby league until very recently, its sister sport touch football has long been the summer sport of choice for women and girls in the rugby league states of NSW and Queensland. This has created a strong skills base in a wide group of participants that is easily translatable and has provided the NRLW with an embarrassment of riches in talent. However, the ability of the competition to continue to expand and improve depends largely on the timelines for professionalism. At the season launch on Tuesday, Abdo was unable to provide details on when and how the NRL plans to make its female stars full-time professionals. “There are a number of factors that go into that; supply and demand, the level of content, the revenue that allows us to do that,” he told AAP. These are lines that women in sport have become very familiar with: the idea that a women’s competition must be generating profits before significant investment is made – a concept that would be rather unusual in the early phases of most business endeavours. While the bumper year of women’s rugby league, which includes two seasons of NRLW, a State of Origin game and a World Cup, is tremendous in terms of the elevation and profile of the sport, it also raises concerns for players who are juggling careers and family responsibilities alongside training, playing and travelling. Parramatta halfback Maddie Studdon famously revealed in the post-match interview after 2018’s State of Origin match that she had lost her job as a result of her rugby league commitments interfering with her work. As the competition expands without a plan for professionalism in place there will be players who are forced to make the opposite decision – to lose their rugby league career for the sake of a job that allows them to pay their rent. There is much to celebrate about the first of the 2022 seasons kicking off this weekend, including triple headers in the first two weeks of the competition in Newcastle and Brisbane. The action on the field will be exciting and fans will find new favourite players as plenty of debutantes take the league by storm. But in the midst of celebration and joy, the fight for better will also continue. Better pay and conditions to allow the stars to flourish. Better planning for the future to ensure the CEO has answers to the important questions about one of his flagship competitions. And better understanding of the importance of the NRLW itself so that there is never a 491-day gap between games again.",Sport/Sport,NRLW’s 491-day hiatus ends but path to professionalism remains unclear | Megan Maurice,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/25/nrlws-491-day-hiatus-ends-but-path-to-professionalism-remains-unclear
2/25/2022,"In Jamal Smith’s mind sits a tableau of family he’s never really known. From memories stretched by time, he grasps at fragments of an absent father, an abusive mother, cousins he knew as siblings, and a found family of friends he fears to lose. Jamal is the protagonist of Son of Sin, the debut novel from the prime minister’s literary prize-winning poet Omar Sakr. It begins in western Sydney, where Jamal is being raised by Lebanese aunties, uncles and grandparents – the extended family of his estranged mother, Hala. Guarded by religion and propriety, they keep the past hushed, and brand Jamal as different. But from whispers, the threads of their secrets unfurl, revealing the sprawling traumas that broke them apart.  And after a sexual awakening on a holy Ramadan night, Jamal’s struggle to find where he fits compounds. Now he must also confront a dormant, dreaded question of self as a queer Muslim boy. Structured in a sprawling four parts, the novel follows Jamal as he grows older – from teenage years fraught with conflict, to later when he impulsively leaves for Turkey, in search of a homeland and a father he has never known. We follow him as an adult whose mental health is deteriorating, and who hates his job, and watch as his most troubled relationships find various forms of closure. Puncturing Jamal’s present are memories of childhood; of abuse at the hands of his mother, violent punishments by his aunts and uncles, nightmares full of demons and fear, all reminding him he is ibn haram, or a son of sin. At school, Jamal finds solace in a group of friends, all outsiders who don’t really belong: Ilo, a burly Samoan boy who likes to leave his hair long, and Emir, a Bosnian who wears pentagram necklaces and studs. They sit around a lunch table discussing Marvel characters, or walk together sharing headphones, listening to Destiny’s Child. Their friendship is challenged by a transgression of trust, but as the boys grow up, they hold each other close: “The last awkward structures of adolescence were falling away, and they were letting them go without letting go of each other.” Around Jamal’s coming of age, Sakr writes an internal reckoning of race, tradition and identity. But while his protagonist’s story is deeply personal, many children or grandchildren of migrants will know it by heart. Not in the details of its plot, but in the feeling of its very foundations. Because we have grown up with it; stories of steadfast faith, stubborn men, an abandoned home. Of taboos, otherness, shame. But also of finding one’s place. From his aunty’s living room, Jamal watches the 2005 Cronulla riots unfold on the news. A mob of young Anglo-Australians, beers in hand, chant: “Fuck! Off! Lebs!” Bangladeshi students are hospitalised after the mob are unable to distinguish one dark nationality from another. Moments like these, written from Australia’s modern history, point to ripples of racism and rage still in motion today. For Jamal’s aunty, who remembers the struggle of life left behind in Lebanon, calling herself an Australian is enough to be grateful for. For Jamal, being unfairly harassed by police is not a price he can happily pay. But there are moments of belonging too. Outside his aunty’s home as the sun sets over Ramadan, cars pile up, a hungry crowd of family washing on to the street. Around the living room, he laughs with cousins, passing Lebanese food to share. On a beach in Turkey, Jamal makes angels in the sand with a man he falls in love with. On the balcony of their family unit overlooking a street in Mersin, Turkey, Jamal listens to his father and uncle talk over a pan of scrambled eggs and sujuk. Sakr writes moments like these into vivid scenes, and when they are not heavy with the weight of his protagonist’s conflict, they are laced with charm, candor and a vital sense of warmth. Son of Sin is the first Australian novel by a queer Arab Muslim man, according to the book’s marketing materials, and though fictive, Sakr’s own experience is subtly threaded through. The novel comes after his acclaimed poetry anthology, The Lost Arabs, and Sakr’s poetic craft has clearly defined his prose, as he weaves Arabic words with dialogue that rings true and a fluid, lyrical internal monologue. During his first sexual experience with another boy, for instance: He could hear [aunt] Rania hissing in his ears, Ta leon ya ibn haram! Come here you sinful boy! How many times had he heard it? A hundred times, a thousand, more: as a shout promising violence, laced in an affectionate chuckle, a whisper almost to herself, an echo as he was lassoed to her from wherever he’d been, a soft song of ibn haram, ibn haram. Jamal is often at conflict with himself. In his world, to be queer is to sin, to be shamed – and his struggle from within his insular, traditional, religious community exposes the toxic masculinity it maintains. To a young Jamal, the consequence of his sin haunts his sleep with nightmares; visions of angels who carry spiked clubs and speak in unfamiliar Arabic with tongues made of flames. They are Munkar and Nakir – angels of the Muslim belief in the Punishment of the Grave, who test the faith of the newly dead. To an older Jamal, this fear morphs into a cycle of hidden experimentation, self-doubt, self-hate and isolation. He is caught in a liminal space between his family, faith, queerness, Arab-ness, Australian-ness. And Son of Sin is Jamal’s internal fight spilling painfully, and poetically, on to the page – cut through with a hunger to destroy that which oppresses us.

2/25/2022,"When husband and wife duo Adam Alhajji and Huda AlSultan started their business Sassi Ice Cream in Adelaide, it was a test run. They wanted to gauge if customers would buy vegan ice-cream with names like Baklawa Dream and Katayef. “We have seven flavours, and it all has some meaning to us, to our Middle Eastern and Saudi background,” AlSultan says. “For example, katayef is based on a pancake we used to eat. It’s stuffed with walnut, desiccated coconut, cinnamon and orange blossom. Some customers say it reminds them of Christmas desserts ... I suppose it’s a way for them to link it to something they already know.”  AlSultan has run with that theme. Sometimes she tells customers that their most popular flavour, Tahini Twist, is the “salted caramel of the Middle East”. This initially surprised customers at Sassi, who were familiar with some of these ingredients only in savoury contexts, AlHajji says. “Sage and pomegranate is our second most popular flavour, but most people think of sage as something to include with meat.” More complex than your standard Neapolitan trio, in many parts of the Middle East and Asia, spices (cardamom, saffron), beans (adzuki, kongjaban) and tea (matcha, cha thai) are common ice-cream flavours. Asian flavours such as durian, red bean and matcha used to be a niche offering in Australia, but now Indonesian and Filipino ice-cream shops are burgeoning in major cities; and supermarkets sell Potong red bean ice-cream and Japanese-style mochi. But while Australia’s ice-cream palate has become broader in recent years, Middle Eastern ice-cream flavours and textures, on the other hand, are still relatively rare. Traditional Turkish ice-cream (dondurma) and the stretchy Levantine ice-cream booza use salep – a flour made from orchids – to give it a stretchy, taffy-like texture. This can be difficult to replicate in Australia, because salep is subject to export control in Turkey. For some, it is a good opportunity to adapt. Harun Yalcin, owner of Cuppa Turca Dondurma and Desserts in Melbourne is one of the innovators. To make dondurma, he had to experiment with other plant-based alternatives to salep. When he eventually hit on the right one, it became his trade secret. “Dondurma is made with goat’s milk and it does not have air volume in the mix, that’s why it is more resistant to heat. It does not melt as easily. It is also much tougher and chewier than gelato,” he says. This is evident in how street vendors in Istanbul pull and stretch the ice-cream, transferring it from one cone to another without any spilling. It is a mesmerising sight, as close to 800m views on the Tiktok hashtag #dondurma attests. But it’s something Yalcin only occasionally does in the shop. “Our focus is not so much on the showiness, but the flavour and texture,” he says. “We stick to the traditional flavours like sun-dried figs and pistachios, and we source the ingredients from Turkey.” He’s open to the occasional experiment though – feta cheese and rockmelon, halva and black mulberry sorbet have all made it onto the menu. Compared with salep – or an alternative – it is relatively easy to get all the ingredients for Afghan ice-cream, or sheer yakh – though it can be painstaking to make it the traditional way. Samir Karmand recalls taking six months to learn it from a mentor. He now sells it from his restaurant, Afghan Chapli Kebab in Sydney. “To make sheer yakh, you need cream, pistachio, rose water and cardamom. It must taste fresh, smooth and creamy, with that tinge of yellow that comes from the cream.” “I am a big fan of cardamom,” Karmand says enthusiastically. “I use it in desserts, tea, savoury food.” Karmand makes his ice-cream by hand, boiling the milk with cardamom, letting it cool, and then placing the liquid in a small stainless-steel container, which is dunked in a larger vessel containing ice cubes and salt. He then shakes the ice-cream mix vigorously from left to right until the milk becomes solid. It’s a similar process to churning, but without a machine. “You cannot take shortcuts and you need your whole body to do this work,” he says. Lately he has made a small tweak in the recipe, to adapt to local tastes. “In Afghanistan people like their desserts sweeter compared to Australia,” he says. “So it’s about finding that balance.”",Lifestyle/Food,‘Tougher and chewier’: Australia is being treated to a new world of ice-cream,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/25/tougher-and-chewier-australia-is-being-treated-to-a-new-world-of-ice-cream
2/25/2022,"The collapse of construction giant Probuild could be just the start of financial trouble across the Covid-ravaged industry as it struggles with soaring costs and project delays, the construction sector’s peak body warns. Probuild, which directly employed about 750 people and had annual revenues of more than $1.4bn, was placed into voluntary liquidation by its South African owners Wilson Bayly Holmes-Ovcon (WBHO) late on Wednesday.  Contractors and other workers turned up at sites on Thursday in several Australian cities to collect equipment, including at CSL’s $750m proposed new headquarters in Melbourne. “We are caught up in a set of circumstances not of our making,” a Probuild spokesperson said. “We are working closely with the administrator [Deloitte] on a number of plans to protect our clients, subcontractors and employees. “The Probuild brand is strong and we intend to keep it that way. We have several options for raising the necessary capital to continue as a premium Australian building company. These will all be pursued.” Jon Davies, chief executive officer of the Australian Constructors Association, said ongoing absenteeism because of Covid and rising costs of labour and materials meant more construction firms may soon follow Probuild into administration. “Everyone assumes that everyone’s making bucket loads of money,” Davies said, noting city skylines are often dotted with cranes, and governments talk up the accelerated spending on infrastructure as a spur for economic growth. “The reality is at a higher level the industry is not in good shape,” he said. “In fact, probably the more work [contractors] have, the more exposed they are to these risks.” For now, governments show little sign of stepping in. The Morrison government highlighted wider economic data from the Australian Securities and Investments Commission showing 46% fewer companies entered external administrations in 2021 than in 2019. Probuild itself had also been struggling for some time. In 2020, WBHO entered talks to sell it to China’s state-owned China State Construction Engineering Corporation for a reported $300m. The Australian Foreign Investment Review Board (Firb), however, rejected the proposal after an intervention by the treasurer Josh Frydenberg, citing national security concerns. Guardian Australia approached Firb and Frydenberg. Spokespeople for both said the government “does not comment on the application of the foreign investment screening arrangements as they apply or could apply to particular cases”. After the Firb rejection, WBHO said it “implemented its strategy to downsize the business, and considered other sales options which proved fruitless due to concerns potential acquirers had as to the impact of the regulatory approach to Covid”. The company, whose motto is “Rely on our ability”, said it was “discontinuing financial assistance” as the potential risk for large mega-building projects now “outweighs the current margins available”. Those risks had intensified because of the “Australian government’s hard-line approach of managing Covid-19”, including border restrictions, snap lockdowns and mandatory work-from-home regulations for many sectors, the company said. “The impact of lockdown restrictions on the retail, hotel and leisure and commercial office sectors of building markets [has] created high levels of business uncertainty in Australia and [has] significantly reduced demand and delayed the award of new projects in these key sectors of the construction industry.” Davies said construction was Australia’s third-largest industry, employing about one in 1o workers. He predicted the wider economy would suffer unless it was placed on a more sustainable footing. In a statement this morning, Deloitte said 18 related companies within the WBHO Australia group had been placed into voluntary administration on Wednesday night. “WBHOA has been a major contributor to the construction sector and the broader economy, including as a direct and indirect employer,” Sal Algeri, who leads Deloitte’s turnaround and restructuring unit, said in a statement. “The Covid-19 pandemic has created challenging trading conditions for many businesses, and for WBHOA, which has also been impacted by certain loss-making projects. “Our immediate focus will be to undertake an urgent assessment of the entities’ financial positions and work with key stakeholders to stabilise the business and projects where possible.”",News/Australia news,‘Not in good shape’: more construction industry collapses could follow Probuild,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/not-in-good-shape-more-construction-industry-collapses-could-follow-probuild
2/25/2022,"The Northern Territory government has been condemned for a “breach of trust” after NT police confirmed that spithoods and restraint chairs remain in use, despite promises to phase out the “inhumane” devices. NT police data reported by the NT News shows spithoods have been used 27 times since 2018 and 21 of those applications having occurred since 2020.  Restraint chairs were used six times on young people in police watch houses between 2020 and 2021, and in one instance was used on a 15-year-old boy in Katherine. While they were used throughout the Territory, the most frequent location they were used was in the Palmerston watch house, where they were used 15 times on children. Guardian Australia contacted NT Police to independently verify these figures but did not receive a response by publication. After events in Don Dale youth detention centre, a 2017 royal commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory described the use of spithoods and restraint chairs as “inhumane” and recommended their use be ended. In March 2017, the minister for territory families and urban housing, Kate Worden, said in a speech to parliament that the NT government had “done an incredible amount of work to reform the youth justice system”. “We will not reintroduce things like spithoods or strapping young offenders into chairs, and we will not be locking them up 24 hours a day in solitary confinement,” Worden said at the time. Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory (AMSAMT) CEO, John Paterson, said he “felt sick to the stomach” when he learned of the continued use of the devices. “Four years down the track, here we are again, still using them,” Paterson said. “To be putting children through this punitive constraint that can have a lifetime effect on their mental health, trauma and stress. It’s unacceptable.” “There’s other ways and means of treating children when they’re taking into custody.” Chief executive officer of the Northern Territory Council of Social Services (NTCOSS), Deborah Di Natale, said the NT government had previously given assurances that use of spithoods and restraint chairs had ended throughout the territory. “It was a complete surprise to us. We were of the impression the Northern Territory government were following the commitments of the royal commission and they had not been used since the 2017 recommendations were handed down,” Di Natale said. “It’s a broken promise and it’s a breach of trust.” In a statement, NT Police minister Nicole Manison said the government had introduced a new offence in 2020 during the pandemic to criminalise intentionally coughing or spitting on frontline workers. “We are committed to keeping our Police safe from spitting, and we also want them to be safe from any accusation for not providing proper care to people in custody, including at watch houses,” Manison said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “We also have a duty of care to provide a safe environment for anyone who is in custody.” Paediatrician Dr Nick Fancourt who provides health services to children in detention said the use of spithoods and restraint chairs on children was “never appropriate and never necessary”. “This is an alarm bell. It’s the canary in the coalmine telling us there is a bigger problem,” Fancourt said. “People within these systems are so pressured with so much work that we’re falling back on these mechanisms we said we would never use.” “And if we don’t really try to look and address those issues we’re going to end up in a similar place as to where we were in 2016 and 2017.” Aboriginal community health service Danila Dilba, the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency, Save the Children Australia and National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Services (NATSILS) have joined NTCOSS and AMSANT in calling for spithoods to be banned at law in the Northern Territory. NATSILS executive officer, Jamie McConnachie, said she was “sick to her stomach” at learning the news and that their use was “indefensible”. “They’re dangerous, they’re humiliating, they’re archaic and they’re notoriously involved in black deaths in custody. They violate international anti-torture laws when they’re used to violate, punish or coerce,” McConnachie said. “We strongly oppose the use of spithoods in all institutional contexts, with no carve outs, anywhere in the country.” UTS Jumbunna Institute research associate Latoya Rule, who has campaigned broadly to ban the use of spithoods nationally, said they were unsurprised at hearing of the continued use of spithoods and that their use was “highly racialised”. “The likelihood of a spithood being used on an Aboriginal child than a non-Aboriginal child is much higher right now, due to the higher level of incarceration,” they said. “If they had the political will, after seeing the torture of people in Don Dale and across the NT, subject to spithoods and their use, they would have banned them on the spot.” Rule, the sibling of Wayne Fella Morrison whose 2016 death in custody is subject to a coronial inquiry, said the Northern Territory government – and every other jurisdiction in the country – should follow the example of South Australia by banning the use of spithoods at law. “If this was happening to non-Aboriginal children, it would have been banned years ago,” they said.",News/Australia news,Northern Territory police still using ‘inhumane’ spithoods and restraint chairs on children,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/25/northern-territory-police-still-using-inhumane-spithoods-and-restraint-chairs-on-children
2/25/2022,"By all accounts, The Batman will be a dark, dark movie. Taking its visual cues from Seven, and featuring a protagonist who has a breakdown and finds himself lured into intractable ethical murk by the suffocating power of vengeance, all signs point to the film being three hours of grot and depression and anguish. But wait, have you tried the new The Batman Oreos yet? They’re absolutely bat-licious!  You have probably noticed by now, but The Batman is now suffering through one of the weirdest marketing campaigns in recent memory. Here is a film that very clearly views itself as a profound piece of art, drenched in mature themes of violence and alienation. Since Christopher Nolan took the reins almost 20 years ago, Batman has become a near mythical piece of our culture, and The Batman has designs to be the clearest expression of this yet. And there is credible artistic precedent here too. Increasingly, if you make a movie based in the world of Batman, you can expect to win an Oscar. This film is going to be a Serious Piece of Cinema. And yet for some reason its marketing campaign is treating it like Sonic the Hedgehog. Right now, there is no product on Earth that The Batman won’t hitch itself to for a quick buck. The latest of these, according to a press release I received this morning, is the Ring video doorbell. In partnership with Warner Bros, Ring users can now download special Batman replies. This means that, should a stranger visit your house when you’re out, they’ll be greeted with a blast of Michael Giacchino’s doomy The Batman theme, accompanied by a cheery voice exclaiming: “Hello neighbour, looks like we missed your bat signal! Please leave a message!” And that’s just for starters. A couple of Saturdays ago, I took my kids to see Sing 2, which was preceded by five separate adverts for a new, Batman-inspired Nissan Juke. And what is so intrinsically Batman-y about this particular Nissan Juke? It has a bit of yellow under the headlights. Apparently that’s enough. Then there is all the food. The Oreos we have covered; they have a picture of Batman’s face on them, because we all know that nothing is more delicious than wolfing down an effigy of agonising mental torment. Papa John’s is also in on the act. Its pizzas currently come in commemorative The Batman boxes (because who doesn’t love using used food receptacles as keepsakes?) and there is also a new side – black ghost chilli chicken wings – that also apparently have something to do with Batman. Meanwhile, in the US, Little Caesars has made a “calzony” (a kind of folded pizza) that’s shaped like the Batman logo, allowing customers to grab themselves a slice of gooey, unresolved trauma. Caffè Nero has subverted the pattern a little by focusing on the Riddler. It has launched a new hot chocolate, with a mysterious new flavour. If you can guess the flavour – which is to say, if you can stomach spending your money on a product that for the purposes of suspension of disbelief was designed by a nightmarish BDSM goblin – you can win a trip to a theme park. Again, I’m barely touching the sides here. Carhartt has made The Batman coats. Lanvin has made an entire The Batman clothing line, as have Puma and EleVen by Venus Williams. Several brands are making The Batman wristwatches. There are The Batman candles, lipsticks, perfumes, nail polishes and soaps. It’s endless. In fact, the last time I can remember anything like this barrage of promotional tie-ins was when the Sex and the City movie was released in 2008. Back then, the tsunami of official brand partnerships was so towering that the film’s own studio labelled the film “the Super Bowl for women”. But that made some amount of sense. Sex and the City was, at heart, a story about material consumption. There was an element of form and function to the campaign. The Batman, though, is a long, bleak film – in part inspired by the suicide of Kurt Cobain – about inescapable spiritual corruption. Nothing about it makes you want to go out and blow your wages on biscuits. If you squint hard enough, you can understand why this promotional onslaught is happening. Post-Covid, there is now no such thing as a box-office sure thing. Film after film has foundered in recent months, as audiences have chosen to stay away and wait for a home release. Slathering Batman’s image over every conceivable product is a sensible enough way to ensure that people will know the film exists. But, at the same time, unless sales of Nissan Jukes absolutely soar in the next few weeks, perhaps it’s all a little too much.",Arts/Film,"Doorbells, chicken and special edition biscuits: why are The Batman’s tie-ins such a joker?",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/24/the-batman-and-the-award-for-weirdest-marketing-campaign-goes-to-
