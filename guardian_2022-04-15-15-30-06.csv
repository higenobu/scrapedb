4/15/2022,"There’s a giant empty space at the centre of Amazon’s splashy new sci-fi series Outer Range, literally at first and then figuratively by the end. In the great expanse of Wyoming, in between two rival ranches, lies a confounding hole in the ground, meaning unknown. It confuses and compels those who come across it, including us for a while, until by the end of eight frustrating and haphazardly paced episodes, exhaustion sets in. Despite unusually grand visuals and a hard-at-work cast insisting otherwise, there’s really nothing at the bottom. Powering us through any drip-feed mystery box show, from Lost to most recently Severance, is an intense, often haunting desire to find out what’s hidden at its centre, a desire so strong that it must outweigh growing impatience. There’s considerable intrigue at the outset here, an opening episode that starts off as a Yellowstone-style western before lurching into a cross between an Ozark-adjacent crime drama and a Stranger Things-esque sci-fi fantasy. At the very least, it’s an unexpected brew. Josh Brolin, riding something of a genre high after Deadpool 2and Dune and snapping half the world away in the Marvel universe, plays Royal, a grizzled rancher (is there any other type?) who comes across a perfectly formed and perfectly eerie hole in his land. Where it goes and what it means are to be determined but its discovery coincides with both the arrival of a mysterious visitor, played by Imogen Poots, and news of legal action to reclaim the land in which it lies, driven by his eccentric neighbour, played by a cranked-up-to-11 Will Patton. Detailing the what-the-fucks and how-the-hells that follow would be both unfair, drifting far into spoiler territory, and genuinely difficult, given how maddeningly opaque so much of the show is. While Outer Range might bear the glossy aesthetic of upper-tier prestige television – it’s produced by Brad Pitt’s Oscar-winning Plan B production company and, rarely for a streaming show, looks more like a movie than a series – its increasing collection of barely explained oddities positions it closer to a niche genre show – SyFy Channel with a budget if you will. The oddities pile up thick and fast, both in the show’s scrappy plotting (which in some episodes feels less like plotting and more like a weird thing followed by a weird thing followed by another weird thing) and in how the story is told and performed, with one character repeatedly breaking into song to sing pop and soft rock classics, and other actors often resorting to long, overacted screams at the sky. Just to further confuse its tone and us as an audience, it’s created and mostly written by a playwright, Juilliard alum Brian Watkins, which means that quite often, if not by the end too often, characters will pause to deliver stagey monologues. If all this sounds distractingly discordant then that barely scratches the surface, and soon into the series, all that initial raised-eyebrow intrigue, which allows for an unmooring yet compelling sense of “what the hell am I watching?”, melts into a pool of annoyance and apathy. Brolin’s dependable shoulders carry the weight of the show efficiently enough, even if none of this is really a stretch for him, but Poots, tasked with a far knottier character, never quite bewitches the way she seems intended to and the electricity their sparring should spark fizzles out fast. It’s also disappointing that two fine female actors are cruelly underserved on the outskirts: Lili Taylor as Brolin’s wife suffering an underpowered crisis of faith and the fantastic Deirdre O’Connell, who recently gave an extraordinary performance on Broadway in Dana H and who is only allowed to briefly vamp it up as a vengeful matriarch before getting sidelined. As leftfield as much of the show might be, it’s still very much trying to be a character-rooted family drama but when so much of it feels like an escalation of moments rather than a story building toward something, it’s hard to find anything to truly grasp on to. Taken in isolation, some of the eeriness is often effective and it really is a genuine pleasure to see a show that deviates from the crushing flatness of so much streaming content. Even without the heavy lifting done by the hard-to-screw-up locations, it’s made with an eye on artistry that more small-screen directors could afford to adopt. But the eye-catching visuals only serve to remind us of the lack of magnetism elsewhere, the show trying to say something about fate, faith and family but falling short on profundity on all counts. As is now too commonly the case with the exasperating expansion of the world of television to far, far beyond breaking point, there’s probably, nay definitely, a more effective two-hour movie buried here, drowned in padding. At a bloated eight-episode run, this one just doesn’t have the range.

4/15/2022,"Since the pandemic began, millions of workers around the world have gone remote and we now have a raft of recent studies that suggest what many workers have long argued: remote work makes people happier, healthier, and even more productive. And it’s especially preferred by people belonging to underrepresented groups, who have reported feeling more included and less anxious when remote. Despite pandemic restrictions lifting, workers aren’t in a hurry to return to the office, or “RTO”. A tight labor market is making it even harder for companies to force people to come back. Banks like JP Morgan initially took a hard line on ending remote work, but have backed down in the face of worker revolts. That’s why growing numbers of bosses are offering special sweeteners to anyone willing to switch off Zoom and trudge back into the conference room. But will any of these tactics work? First we had cubicles. Then came the “open-plan” trend. Now companies are betting that workers want offices that feel more like the home environments they’ve gotten accustomed to. At a thinktank discussion called “Designing Workplaces for the Human Experience”, architects bragged that they had equipped Uber’s new headquarters in San Francisco with luxuries like operable windows, outdoor terraces, and a wellness center that has hanging swing seats. One architect explained that they had designed a floor overlooking greenery to make “employees feel like they’re in a tree house”. Talk about above par: in New York City’s midtown, one real estate firm has installed a professional-level virtual golf links that uses infrared sensors and cameras to analyze your swing. Brian Wallick, the director of investments at Nuveen Real Estate, told the New York Post that “adding an amenity like golf simulators helps to foster collaboration as part of a unique user experience, especially in a commercial office building”. One company that has taken the idea of making work feel like home very literally: by creating private pods to let employees masturbate. At Stripchat, a Cyprus-based adult social network firm, workers can now spend up to half an hour a day on the company dime inside a “wank pod”: an enclosed black sphere equipped with a comfy chair, Oculus virtual reality headset, lotion, lube and tissues. A spokesperson for the company said it wanted to “provide current and attract new employees with a safe, comfortable space to rub one out”. Companies everywhere are hosting back-to-office extravaganzas, like Microsoft’s recent lawn party with free tacos, gyros, fried chicken, and a life-size chess board and beer garden, according to the New York Times. That was followed last week by Qualcomm’s massive shindig, where several thousand staff reportedly joined a happy hour to load up on food, drinks, and t-shirts. Then there’s Goldman Sachs, which has tried to lure workers back to their desks by bringing in food trucks serving everything from lobster to donuts, and blasting live music outside its offices in the afternoon. In some of its offices, it now offers free breakfast, lunch, and ice cream in addition to a dinner stipend (although staff gripe that the $25 the investment bank provides isn’t enough to get a burrito delivered). But some firms are cutting back. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, raised ire among its well-paid workers by delaying its free dinner from 6pm to 6.30pm. On an internal message board, CTO Andrew Bosworth defended the changes, suggesting employees were acting entitled, according to the New York Times. Another food service employee chimed in: “I can honestly say when our peers are cramming three to 10 to-go boxes full of steak to take them home, nobody cares about our culture.” Google is giving its US-based employees reimbursements for a monthly subscription to ride a slick Unagi electric scooter. The scooter sharing service normally costs $49 a month, on top of a $50 sign-up fee. But employees have to use the scooter at least nine times a month to qualify for Google’s reimbursement. “They know there’s apprehension amongst employees,” Unagi CEO David Hyman told The Verge. “People got really accustomed to working from home. And they’re just trying to do everything they can to improve the experience of coming back.” But if a scooter feels like a disappointing perk, real estate group CoStar decided to enter its in-person employees into a raffle to win a Tesla. (It also gave away $10,000 in cash to a randomly selected in-person worker every day for a month.) The company’s CEO, Andrew Florance, told the Wall Street Journal: “Yes, this is a lot of money, but in the context of a multibillion-dollar company with thousands of staff and hundreds of offices, it’s a drop in the bucket. So you can have some fun, you can incentivize people to do the right thing” – as in get back to the office. For those employees that got a pandemic pet in 2020 and didn’t fully think about how they’d care for it after lockdown, a number of companies are now offering “pet stipends”, a monthly reimbursement for dog-walking, cat-sitting, or whatever care a furry friend may need. This makes good sense when you consider a recent survey that shows two-thirds of pet owners have searched for a more flexible job to spend more time with their fur babies. Many other companies are simply letting employees bring their pets to work. The increasing numbers of pet-friendly offices come stocked with water bowls, chew toys and poop bags. It’s not just a ploy to get pet owners back to the office, though: research also shows that the presence of a dog can do wonders for collaboration. Allergies, not so much. A recent survey found that the perk workers really want aren’t ping-pong tables or free beer, but the freedom to choose when and how to work. But even so-called hybrid approaches – in which workers come in for part of the week – are getting pushback from employees. Even as Apple has touted its products as enabling a new generation of remote work, it’s requiring employees to come back to the office at least three days a week starting in late May. One employee griped to Bloomberg: “Working from home has so many perks. Why would we want to go back?” Another complained that forcing workers to drive two hours a day undermines Apple’s environmental goals. If bosses have long pushed the idea that workers must choose between flexibility and job stability, the pandemic has proven that you can have both. And as management tries to attract people back to offices, more companies are now offering flexible schedules, increased or unlimited paid time off, expanded sick leave, childcare benefits, wellness programs, and employee assistance programs. Some companies are trying out four-day workweeks while paying workers for five, and finding that workers are happier and doing better.",News/US news,"Tacos, treehouses, virtual golf: top firms try to bribe workers back to the office",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/15/companies-lure-workers-back-to-office
4/15/2022,"People are always saying how such-and-such-a-village used to have a dozen pubs, and now has only a Spar. Well, Ingleton, which has a population of about 2,000, has three pubs, an ex-servicemen’s club and a “microbar” called the Old Post Office, which is doing what canny little boozers all over the country do now – providing a warm environment for real ale and friendly chat, while conserving a historic building. There’s also an excellent pub – Masons Freehouse – on the main road, the A65, just 10 minutes’ walk from the centre. I would recommend having a pint in any or all of these before setting off if it weren’t for the fact that dehydration could be an issue for the classic uphill walk that starts in the centre of Ingleton. The hike to the summit of Ingleborough is straightforward, and moderately hard, depending on the weather. I went up on a clear, warmish day and while I met people coming down who said there was a lot of low cloud on top, I made it to the summit just as the clouds cleared. I was lucky though: as the climb goes from about 130 metres to 723 metres above sea level – Ingleborough is the second highest of the Yorkshire Three Peaks – it’s vital to check the weather and wear appropriate clothing. A broad bridleway winds up from the B6255, just east of the village. It’s a perfect way to start a longish walk as the ascent is gradual, with good views of the surrounding farmland and beyond to the limestone pavement of Twistleton Scar on the left and Whernside, the highest of the Three Peaks.

The track starts to climb more sharply after a mile or so, with well-made stone staircases up the steepest sections, protecting the terrain. This is national park territory and – unlike the neighbouring Forest of Bowland, which is owned by the Queen and other rich individuals, and routinely burned for grouse – these hills protect vital peat bogs, heather, moor grass and plants such as bog asphodel. The geology is interesting, too, with limestone outcrops bursting through the grass on either side of the stone steps. Streams pour through the porous rock, and deep in the crevasses – known as grikes – are small flowers and mosses. It’s worth stopping to study the forms and flora, because the going demands your full attention. It’s also advisable to raise your head and look about, as the view below suddenly opens up to reveal the magnificent Ribblehead viaduct and the wide valley where the Ribble rises. Ingleborough’s summit is a broad, flattish tableland, and while it’s only a few feet higher than the staircases, it is far more exposed. The first thing to do on reaching the final lip is pull out a sweater or jacket. Since the best spots for tea and a snack, minus wind, were taken up – Ingleborough gets busy at weekends, especially when the weather is fair – I hunkered down on the lee-side of the hill, with a view over to Pen y Ghent, the lowest but best looking of the Three Peaks. It took me an hour and a half from Ingleton to the top. This felt quite speedy at the time, but it’s actually rather pathetic. People have been walking and running the course of the Three Peaks for more than a century; the record back in 1887, according to a sign on the footpath, was 14 hours, set by two teachers; the record today is 2 hours, 46 minutes and 3 seconds. The distance is 24½ miles. Amazing. I’d walked all of 3 miles. From the top there are many ways down. The easiest and quickest is to double back to Ingleton. There are also paths down to Clapham, Horton-in-Ribblesdale and Chapel-le-Dale. I was aiming for the last of the three, which involved a very steep staircase, with mercifully short drops at each step. I bumped into a couple of runners, who were 20 miles into their challenge. They looked somewhat weary, but unfazed. Behind them came assorted huffing and puffing scramblers, in a state of shock at the tough ascent. Eventually, this drop levelled out and a series of flagstone and wooden paths led across a beautiful wide open marsh. Signage at the far end said I had come down the Ridge Walk and welcomed me to Southerscales nature reserve, a wondrous swathe of limestone pavement with rain- and wind-sculpted formations spread over grassland and blanket bog. Immediately to the right was an impressive crater, a shake hole (sinkhole) colourfully called Braithwaite Wife Hole. But my eyes were already fixed on the shelves and stumps, fists and clumps of polished limestone. In his famous poem In Praise of Limestone, Yorkshireman WH Auden linked the rock to the human body, to nature and to history, and to shimmering Mediterranean mountainscapes. But English limestone is as beautiful as any, strangely white and smooth, and both firm and ever-eroding. Sheep were my main companions during this walk, but a few Belted Galloway cows mooched around the fields beyond the reserve. Eventually the path zigzagged down to Chapel-le-Dale, a tiny hamlet. Here stands the Old Hill Inn; its bar and restaurant is temporarily closed to passing trade, but it’s a great place to stay a night. To get back to Ingleton, there’s a strip of asphalt along the line of a Roman Road that runs parallel with the B6255. The limestone scars are close on the right now and there are optional diversions to both Thornton Force waterfall and White Scar Cave. Ordnance Survey OL2 covers the Western Dales. The Settle Carlisle train stops at Horton, Ribblehead and Settle; there are buses from Settle to Ingleton. The quirky Old Post Office is a microbar – which is to say it’s small and focuses on drinks, ultra-personalised service and a cosy, welcoming atmosphere (all the things “pubs” used to do). Well-travelled Yorkshiremen Rob and Adam took over the venue in 2019, and have divided it into a main, art-filled gallery bar, a speakeasy-style, armoury-themed room and, for the cold months, a private, bookable, vaguely Game of Thrones-themed shelter in the garden. With room for six people, it’s called the Sanctum, and comes with blankets, music, heating and mood lighting. Three cask and four keg ales – mostly local – are served, including Old Post Office Blonde from Lancaster Brewery, plus lots of bottles of fine continental beer. Food is snacks only (premium scratchings, crisps and nuts) and the place has become a walkers’ pit-stop, located as it is at the end of the Ingleton Waterfalls Trail. Hosting micro-live music gigs from time to time, the OPO is popular with locals as well as tourists. The beautiful Old Hill Inn, here since 1615, started life as a farm and was later a drovers’ stopover. a base for trips in the Dales.Prior to the pandemic it was a popular drop-in for walkers. But now it’s functioning as a hotel only, with two cosy ensuite rooms, two glamping pods and a caravan site. The owners, Colin and Sabena Martin, are fine chefs and serve locally sourced food.

4/15/2022,"He is the visionary behind the Eden Project and the Lost Gardens of Heligan, two innovative, pathfinding Cornish attractions that draw hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. But Sir Tim Smit’s bid to create a third landmark project in the far south-west of England – an education centre for horticulture, agronomy and cookery on a Cornish hillside – has suffered a setback after residents of the ancient town of Lostwithiel protested in their droves and, for the moment at least, managed to halt the scheme in its tracks. Smit, who caused huge upset earlier this year for suggesting the Cornish are not articulate and too fond of looking back to imaginary “good old days”, had claimed the Gillyflower Farm scheme would be an important research centre for crops of the future and boost the economy of Lostwithiel, a medieval capital of Cornwall. However, hundreds of residents objected, claiming its prominent position would spoil precious views from the town and from the ramparts of the spectacular Restormel Castle, and were singularly unimpressed that – in their minds – Smit had not consulted with them properly before pressing ahead. At a fiery meeting of Cornwall council’s strategic planning committee in Truro on Thursday, members voted by seven to four to reject the recommendation of their own officers that the plan should be approved, several saying they were disappointed at the consultation process of Smit’s team. Sarah Chudleigh, one of the residents who spoke at the meeting, said afterwards she was “overwhelmed” at the councillors’ decision. “I think it’s wonderful for the town,” she said. Chudleigh said she feared that if it were allowed, the development would suck business away from the town centre, and the jobs it would create for local people would tend to be less skilled and poorly paid. “So much of Cornwall is being developed but it’s not for the sake of the people, it’s for the financial gain of the rich and powerful,” she said. Lively demo outside New County Hall in Truro ahead of a decision on a new Sir Tim Smit project pic.twitter.com/vHGH6qSxqr On the project’s website Gillyflower is billed as “a third chapter from some of the team that brought you the Eden Project and the Lost Gardens of Heligan”. Smit and his family, who live in the area, have already restored a “sustainable” golf course there and planted orchards and gardens filled with rare, historic fruit trees. As well as the education centre, they were hoping to create 19 holiday lodges, a cafe, a shop selling goods produced at the site, a distillery and microbrewery. But the opposition was clear before the Truro meeting with a song written for the occasion performed as councillors arrived: “Stand, Cornwall, stand! / Every day they’re taking your land / And greed is bulldozing your traditions away / Oh stand for yourself, Cornwall stand!” Placards featured slogans such as “Community not greed” and, even more bluntly, “Orchard my arse”. During the meeting Smit said the climate emergency meant projects like Gillyflower, which is named after a traditional Cornish apple, were needed. “The demand for horticulture is going to go through the roof,” he said. “What most people don’t seem to understand yet is that in the attempt to get away from the current agricultural models we are going to have to find a whole range of crops that are not totally dependent on fossil fuels. “The whole point behind Gillyflower is a training facility for the development of heritage fruit and vegetables. We’re creating wealth, creating partnerships and making Lostwithiel resilient for a future that still remains ours to make.” Smit’s team told the meeting their own polling had shown that 70% of local businesses supported the scheme, though conceded that the project may have had a “less bumpy ride” if more consultation had been done earlier. Colin Martin, the Lib Dem councillor for Lostwithiel, insisted the project would harm a place designated an area of great landscape value. He said if the town became more of a draw, more people would buy second homes, as they have done in the Cornish harbour town of Padstow since the arrival of Smit’s friend, the celebrity chef Rick Stein, making it harder for local young people to find a place to live. Outside the meeting, Martin said Smit’s criticism of the Cornish had not helped his cause. “He has sometimes spoken about Cornish people, giving the impression he is better than all of us and we should be grateful for the good things he has bestowed upon us.” He anticipated that Smit would appeal but hoped, meanwhile, that bridges could be built. “It’s a really tight-knit community,” he said. “I have been shocked and saddened by how this application has caused a wedge in the community. People have been driven apart. I hope we can put this behind us and rebuild community spirit.”",News/UK news,Eden Project founder loses planning battle for education centre in Cornwall,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/15/gillyflower-farm-eden-project-founder-tim-smit-loses-planning-battle-lostwithiel-cornwall

After all, this head-spinning New York mystery drama stuck its landing so satisfyingly that further variations on a comparable theme risk tarnishing those memories. This time, Natasha Lyonne’s Nadia finds her existential portal via a subway train that transports her back to 1982. She understands the reality of her situation when she lights a cigarette and no one bats an eyelid. But why is she there? The answer is simultaneously logical and terrifying. It’s an intriguing premise and, once again, Lyonne anchors the whole enterprise with phlegmatic yet fiery charm.

Meanwhile, we wait to see how the confirmed return of Walter (Bryan Cranston) and Jesse (Aaron Paul) is handled. PHNetflix, from Tuesday 19 April “We go after the cool kids … Are we exclusionary? Absolutely!” Former Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries was candid about the brand he’d been hired to reinvigorate. But, as this documentary shows, that’s not an approach without its issues. For a start, how does it translate to hiring practices? It’s been suggested that “cool” very much meant white – certainly no dreadlocks and no headscarves. Fascinating and troubling, this works as an era-specific cautionary tale and a wider rumination on modern American culture. PHNetflix, from Tuesday 19 April In many ways, this likable adaptation of Alice Oseman’s graphic novel is all mood swings and clandestine snogging. The twist is that the relationships at the heart of the series are same sex – and Heartstopper does a fine job of folding universal teenage angst into the jeopardy of being out (or outed) in a school where homophobic bullying is still a danger.

4/15/2022,"Harry Styles, Billie Eilish and The Weeknd are headed to Coachella this weekend for the first edition of the mega-festival in three years. The California-based festival, which takes place over two weekends, is expected to draw more than 125,000 people a day. In February, the festival announced that there would be no rules regarding mask-wearing, testing and vaccination proof “in accordance with local guidelines”. Los Angeles county has seen a small rise in cases in recent weeks and while numbers remain low, people have been urged to remain aware of dangers. This week, the LA county public health director, Barbara Ferrer, asked residents to do their “very best to make use of the powerful tools at hand, vaccinations, boosters, testing, and masking” to ensure everyone is “as safe as possible”. A statement on the official Coachella site reads: “There is an inherent and elevated risk of exposure to Covid-19 in any public place or place where people are present. And there is no guarantee, express or implied, that those attending the festival will not be exposed to Covid-19.” The last week has seen a host of pop-up testing sites appear in the local area. “If you’re not feeling well, by all means consider staying at home,” said a Riverside University health system spokesperson, Jose Arballo. “I know it’s a big financial investment for those that purchase tickets. But your health is more important.” After two years of many cancelled and postponed live music events, Coachella marks a triumphant comeback for the industry, kicking off a summer that will also see returns for The Roots Picnic, Glastonbury, Boston Calling and Mo Pop, each with different Covid-19 restrictions or lack thereof. The return of the festival will also be a big boost to Coachella Valley businesses after a two-year absence, with an expected 30% rise in sales for the period. Styles will headline the first night while Eilish, who performed at the festival in 2019, will take over night two. “I’m headlining Coachella,” the 20-year-old singer said in a recent interview. “I mean, that’s a crazy thing to say.” The recent Oscar-winner for her Bond theme No Time to Die also suggested she was underwhelmed by her previous Coachella experience. “I really resent the things that were surrounding me during that period of time,” she said. Kanye West had been scheduled to take on the final night but earlier this month pulled out, along with Travis Scott, who was to appear alongside him. The star would have taken home a reported $8.5m for the two weekends. Night three headliners will now be Swedish House Mafia and The Weeknd.
