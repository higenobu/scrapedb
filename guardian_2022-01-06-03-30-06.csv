1/6/2022,"More than 40% of Americans still do not believe that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 presidential election despite no evidence of widespread voter fraud, according to a new Axios-Momentive poll.  The poll, released on the eve of the first anniversary of the attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, found that 55% of those surveyed believe Biden won the election. That figure has barely changed since Axios’s poll from 2020, published shortly before the insurrection. That poll, published in 2020, found 58% said that they accepted Biden as the legitimate winner of the presidential election. Despite Biden’s inauguration, the attack on the Capitol and the multiple investigations that have debunked the lies pushed by the former president that the election was stolen, the poll suggests that the same level of doubt persists. “It’s dispiriting to see that this shocking thing we all witnessed last year hasn’t changed people’s perceptions,” Laura Wronski, senior manager for research science at Momentive, told Axios. A majority of Americans also said they are expecting a repeat of the deadly 6 January attack in the next few years. The polls, conducted from 1 to 5 January of this year, surveyed nearly 2,700 adults, and found nearly 57% – about half of Republicans and seven in ten Democrats – believe that events similar to the attack are likely to occur again. In addition, nearly two-thirds or 63% said that the 6 January attack has at least temporarily changed the way they think about their democratic government. A third said that those changes are temporary. Nearly as many, 31%, said that those changes are permanent. About 37% of those surveyed said they had lost faith in American democracy, while 10% said they had never had faith in the system. Another 49% said they do have faith. Among those surveyed who said they have lost faith, 47% said they were Republicans while 28% were Democrats. Fifty-eight per cent of Americans said they supported the investigative work of the House select committee investigating the riot. Among those, 88% are Democrats, 58% are independents and 32% are Republicans. Just slightly more than half of American adults, 51%, said individuals associated with the insurrection should face criminal penalties if they refuse to comply with subpoenas. Republicans have also been revealed to be three or four more times as likely as Democrats to say voter fraud is a problem in their state, despite such claims being thoroughly debunked. Wronski said she believes the results of the poll shows either “Biden hasn’t done enough” to push back against disinformation, or “it shows that he never had a chance”. She added: “The partisan division is still the story.”",News/US news,More than 40% in US do not believe Biden legitimately won election – poll,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/05/america-biden-election-2020-poll-victory
1/6/2022,"My aunt Anne Mobbs, who has died aged 84, was a community organiser and activist who was fully committed to promoting social justice. Born into a Jewish family in Tottenham, north London, Anne was one of the five children of Miriam (nee Weinberg), a seamstress, and Nathan Wrightman, a carpenter. She and her two sisters were evacuated to Cornwall during the second world war, and after finishing her schooling she worked in secretarial roles at Granada TV, the BBC World Service and the National Film Theatre.  Inspired by the formation of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in 1958, she quickly became an active CND member until, with her husband, David Mobbs, a biochemist and Communist party member whom she married in 1959, she moved to Nigeria in 1960 with their young children. David lectured at the University of Ibadan while Anne was employed by the university’s drama school and helped to organise film and theatre festivals. That work led her into contact with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and years later she was involved in protesting againast his execution by the Nigerian military. Anne and her family also lived in Ghana and Zambia, and in Zambia she raised funds for the African National Congress. It was when Anne returned to the UK in 1971 and settled in Oxford that she became part of my life. Growing up under Margaret Thatcher, I was heavily influenced by Anne’s commitment to help those who were suffering in the harsh political climate. She also supported successful campaigns to get Oxford city council to disinvest its pension fund from apartheid South Africa. In her work as an assistant community relations officer in Oxford, from 1975 onwards, she helped to win racial discrimination cases and to organise support for initiatives celebrating black culture. From the late 1980s onwards, Anne was Oxford city council’s Fun in the Parks festival organiser, booking music, bands, circus acts, comedians and stalls. She also helped to set up the annual Oxford International Women’s festival, raised the profile of the Oxford bail support group, set up by Asylum Welcome to secure release of those held at Campsfield House detention centre, and was a driving force behind the closure of the centre – garnering support from the band Radiohead. Even in retirement Anne could not resist getting involved, supporting a local group in the Jericho area of Oxford, where she lived. Anne and David separated in 1973 and divorced two years later. She is survived by her children, Keir, Ruth and Amanda, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.",News/UK news,Anne Mobbs obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/anne-mobbs-obituary
1/6/2022,"John Harris may be correct to frame the avoidance of vaccination by a significant portion of the UK population as the consequence of mistrust in authority or government (Understanding, not judgment, should shape our response to those who remain unjabbed, 2 January). However, I and many millions of others do not trust this government at all, but we still accepted vaccination. Social factors may explain the existence of vaccine avoidance, but they do not justify it. Under UK laws, no degree of inequality allows a car driver to transfer to the right side of the road in protest against a mistrusted government. True freedom is the liberty from being harmed by others, regardless of whether those actions are deliberately harmful. The freedom to “innocently” spread disease is not a fundamental right. The enormous human cost of supporting unvaccinated and seriously ill patients in hospital is having a direct impact on all our lives. It is time to take the moral high ground: celebrate the vaccinators and publicly avow that vaccination is good, that being vaccinated is a public duty and that failure to comply by any citizen without adequate medical reasons is a dereliction of that public duty.Dr Patrick ByrneBermondsey, London   John Harris refers to the supposed “coercing [of] people into getting vaccinated using stringent Covid passports”. Having a Covid passport allows people to access certain defined services; if they don’t want to be vaccinated they won’t have access, but no one is forcing them to such access. In any case, there are many actual constraints on people that are a vital part of society, such as wearing seatbelts. No one is being coerced into being vaccinated; this is simply the price for taking part in normal society.Dr Richard CarterPutney, London  Maybe the unvaccinated do deserve our empathy, not judgment, but understanding and feeling their pain doesn’t solve the problem. The fact remains that they endanger themselves but, much more importantly, everybody else through their potential viral transmissibility. Insisting that access to certain venues and activities are limited to the fully jabbed might indeed imply a negative judgment, but surely avoiding this possible offence is much less important than protecting the national community as a whole?Dr Bill JonesBeverley, Yorkshire  John Harris risks oversimplifying people’s understanding of why some of us – around five million adults according to his article – remain unvaccinated in the UK. While there is plenty of evidence that people from particular communities mistrust the public institutions that wish to see them vaccinated, this certainly isn’t the case for all five million of us. As a white, middle-class public servant, I can’t really be considered “historically mistrustful” of institutions, nor am I reckless, but I do have my own sincerely held reasons for not wanting to be vaccinated, none of which are derived from “online cults”. Actually, I don’t want judgment or empathy, I just want there to be safe spaces for debate to take place, where people need not fear being labelled cranks. This includes within national newspapers like the Guardian. As it is, Mr Harris merely continues to promote the prevailing discourse – that in an ideal world everybody would be vaccinated.Paul MartinBerkhamsted, Hertfordshire  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/6/2022,"For years, Nursultan Nazarbayev has been used to performative adoration from the citizens of Kazakhstan. The country’s leader for nearly three decades, he was showered with praise and adulation at showpiece events, and his image smiled down from billboards across the country.  When he stepped down in 2019, he was able to choose his successor, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, and kept significant power as head of the security council and general behind-the-scenes powerbroker. He retained his official title of Elbasy, or leader of the nation. Astana, the capital city he ordered built in the heart of the Kazakh steppe, was even renamed in his honour. To Nazarbayev, it must have seemed like he had found an answer to the problem vexing ageing autocrats across the region: how to step aside in old age without risking retribution. Vladimir Putin and others were doubtless watching with interest. The events of the past few days might suggest that different lessons should be drawn. Statues of Nazarbayev, meant to be monuments to his legacy, have been torn down by protesters. Instead of chanting “Elbasy”, many angry Kazakh protesters are now chanting “Shal ket” – or “Old man, out!” Discontent at poverty, inequality and corruption led to increasing unrest in the country in recent years, and much of the anger is directed at Nazarbayev himself, who for so long appeared untouchable. Among Central Asia’s vicious and repressive autocrats, Nazarbayev always seemed the most nimble. Born in 1940, he rose through the ranks of the Communist party and became Kazakhstan’s first leader on independence. He managed to hold the country together during the 1990s, and later to avoid the extreme repressive violence of his peers in Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while also avoiding the revolutionary sentiment of Kyrgyzstan. When 16 people were killed in 2011 protests, he solicited advice from Tony Blair about how best to spin the violence. He charted a delicate geopolitical course in the years after Kazakh independence, remaining friendly towards Russia, while also courting western leaders and energy companies, who turned a blind eye to the lack of democracy and instead focused on securing lucrative contracts in the country. Western lawyers, accountants and advisers helped the new Kazakh elite invest their fortunes in London mansions and Swiss villas. His daughter and grandson are believed to own £80m of London property. Nazarbayev also engaged a steady stream of western architects and urban planners to build his new capital city. In 2010, Nazarbayev, perhaps with one eye on the clock, ordered scientists to investigate the creation of an “elixir” that could prolong human life. Eventually, it seems, he accepted the inevitability of the human ageing process and announced in 2019 he was stepping aside. Last year, the director Oliver Stone made a hagiographic film portrait about Nazarbayev’s time in office, named Qazaq: History of the Golden Man, and numerous statues to the retired leader were erected across the country. Now, his image has become a lightning rod for discontent. On Wednesday, Tokayev announced he was replacing Nazarbayev as chair of the security council, and there were rumours on Wednesday that Nazarbayev might leave the country for “medical treatment”. It is not clear yet how the unrest in Kazakhstan will evolve, and what role Nazarbayev will play in them, but it seems certain that the events of the past few days will alter the historical legacy he had imagined he would leave.",News/World news,"Poverty, inequality and corruption: Kazakhstan discontent will alter former leader’s legacy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/old-man-out-kazakhstan-discontent-to-change-leaders-legacy
1/6/2022,"Comparing the experience of European education systems in handling the Covid-19 pandemic is doubtless instructive (Masks in schools: several EU countries already enforce them in primaries, 3 January). Your article presents the salutary examples of countries such as France, which imposed a mask mandate on all pupils over 11 last November, and Belgium, which since December has required all pupils over six to be masked. However, as an educational comparativist usually based in Japan, I read reports like this while inwardly screaming: “What about east Asia?” There has been some lurid coverage in the UK press of China’s draconian lockdowns. But we see very little discussion of the very different cases of Taiwan, South Korea and Japan, which have managed the pandemic far more effectively than their western counterparts, and with far less disruption to schooling.  This is especially so in Japan, where all primary and secondary pupils have worn masks at school (including in the classroom) since the onset of the pandemic. During that time, Japanese pupils have missed a total of just four to five weeks of face-to-face teaching.Edward VickersKyushu University, Japan; visiting professor, UCL Institute of Education  In light of the reintroduction of face coverings to secondary school classrooms this week, it is of course true to say teenagers are resilient, demonstrating endless adaptability. But spare a thought for deaf schoolchildren who can’t lip-read or understand facial expressions when face masks are being worn. They have faced challenge upon challenge since the start of the pandemic, isolating during everyday life, facing cancelled exams and enduring online lessons without subtitles. Thousands of deaf secondary-aged pupils will be filled with a sense of dread about the reintroduction of face coverings in class as they return to school. Public health should always be prioritised, but deaf children’s inclusion in society matters too. We cannot continue to see deaf children falling behind their classmates and their mental health suffering where a few simple adjustments and more sensitivity from the public would make all the difference.Jo CampionDeputy director of advocacy, National Deaf Children’s Society  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/6/2022,"An Italian mafia boss on the run for 20 years was tracked down to a Spanish town after being spotted on Google Street View. Gioacchino Gammino, a convicted murderer listed among Italy’s most wanted gangsters, was arrested in Galapagar, a town near Madrid, where over the years he had married, changed his name to Manuel, worked as a chef and owned a fruit and vegetable shop.  Sicilian police carried out several investigations in their search for Gammino, 61, and a European arrest warrant was issued in 2014. The fugitive was traced to Spain, but it was Google Street View that helped to pinpoint his precise location. The navigation tool, accessible through Google Maps, had captured an image of two men chatting outside a fruit and vegetable shop called El Huerto de Manu, or Manu’s Garden, in Galapagar. Police believed one of the men closely resembled Gammino, but his identity was only confirmed when they came across a listing for a nearby restaurant called La Cocina de Manu or Manu’s Kitchen. The shop and the restaurant are now closed, but the police found a photo of Gammino, dressed in his chef’s garb, on a still-existing Facebook page for La Cocina de Manu. He was recognisable by the scar on the left side of his chin. The restaurant’s menu included a dish called Cena Siciliana or Sicilian dinner. Gammino was arrested on 17 December but the details surrounding his capture did not come to light until they were reported by La Repubblica on Wednesday. The details were confirmed by the Palermo prosecutor Francesco Lo Voi, who led the latest investigation. “It’s not as if we spend our days wading through Google Maps to find fugitives,” he told the Guardian. “There were many previous and long investigations, which led us to Spain. We were on a good path, with Google Maps helping to confirm our investigations.” After 20 years in hiding, Gammino thought he had managed to sever all his ties with Sicily. Upon his arrest, he reportedly told police: “How did you find me? I haven’t even called my family for 10 years!” Gammino belonged to a mafia clan in Agrigento, Sicily, which was caught up in a bloody feud with Cosa Nostra, Sicily’s main mafia network, in the 1990s. He was first arrested in 1984, when he was investigated by the anti-mafia judge Giovanni Falcone, who was assassinated by the mafia in a car bomb in 1992. Gammino was wanted for murder and various other mafia-related crimes. He was arrested for a second time in Barcelona in 1998. He had been serving a life sentence at Rebibbia prison in Rome when, in 2002, he managed to escape during the commotion of the making of a film at the prison. It is not the first time a mafia fugitive has been caught with the help of the web. In March last year, Mark Feren Claude Biart was captured in the Caribbean after appearing in YouTube cooking videos. Biart had been on the run since 2014, when Italian prosecutors ordered his arrest for trafficking cocaine in the Netherlands on behalf of the Cacciola clan of the ’Ndrangheta mafia. Until his arrest, Biart had been leading a quiet life among the Italian expat community in Boca Chica in the Dominican Republic. Although the YouTube videos of him flaunting his cooking skills never showed his face, police said he was betrayed by the distinctive tattoos on his body. In 2019, police arrested a mobster with the Camorra mafia organisation while he was eating pasta with his two cats sitting beside him in an apartment in the outskirts of Naples.",News/World news,Italian mafia fugitive arrested in Spain after Google Street View sighting ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/italian-mafia-fugitive-arrested-in-spain-after-google-maps-sighting

1/6/2022,"The US has imposed new sanctions on the Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, a television station under his control and two other officials for “significant corruption and destabilizing activities”. The sanctions, involving asset freezes and visa bans, follow Dodik’s threat to withdraw Serbs from the Bosnian national army and other state-level institutions, potentially destroying the 1995 Dayton peace treaty and opening the way for a return to conflict.  Official statements accompanying the sanctions focus on the corruption which US officials say underpin Dodik’s political posturing. “His divisive ethno-nationalistic rhetoric reflects his efforts to advance these political goals and distract attention from his corrupt activities,” a Treasury statement said. “Cumulatively, these actions threaten the stability, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of BiH and undermine the Dayton Peace Accords, thereby risking wider regional instability.” It said Dodik had handed government contracts and monopolies in the Serb-run half of Bosnia, Republika Srpska (RS) to close business associates. “With his corrupt proceeds, Dodik has engaged in bribery and additional corrupt activities to further his personal interests at the expense of citizens in the RS,” the Treasury said. Dodik has already been sanctioned in 2017, for obstruction of the Dayton accord. The new measures are wider, criminalizing financial donations to him, and targeting Alternativna Televizija, a television station based in Banja Luka, the biggest town in the RS. The channel is privately owned by a company closely linked to Dodik’s family, the Treasury said, and operates as Dodik’s personal propaganda outlet. “Dodik has awarded ATV-related contracts directly to members of his family, which he has used as yet another avenue for corruption,” the Treasury said. “He has funneled money directly from public companies to ATV for corrupt purposes.” Dodik shrugged off the sanctions telling a local media outlet: “If they think that they will discipline me like this, they are grossly mistaken,” A Dodik adviser, Milan Tegeltija, was also banned from entering the US. The US Secretary of State, Tony Blinken, said Tegeltija had used his former role as head of the state-level judiciary for “corrupt acts that included using his political influence and official power for his personal benefit”. A Bosnian Muslim, or Bosniak, party leader, Mirsad Kukić, was also targeted in Wednesday’s sanction. He is accused of using his role as manager of the publicly owned Banovici mine and his seat in parliament to use “political influence and official power for his personal benefit”. Although the effect on sanctions on Dodik are reduced by his limited financial exposure in the US, Daniel Serwer, a former US special envoy to Bosnia, said they still represent a setback for Dodik. “They do have a psychological impact. The question of how strong the financial impact is,” Serwer said. “Basically this prevents designated individuals from international financial transactions, almost all of which go through the US in one fashion or another.” He added: “The sanctions, in addition to targeting Dodik and Alternativa, are a warning to other politicians and companies, who may have more to fear than Dodik.”",News/World news,US sanctions Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik for ‘destabilizing activities’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/us-sanctions-bosnian-serb-leader-milorad-dodik
1/6/2022,"Turn on the radio or scroll down your phone and the big headlines belong to Covid. But when this latest version of the plague drops off the front pages, another story is set to take its place – and this one will hang around for most of the year, setting the terms of trade at Westminster and possibly deciding Boris Johnson’s future. The cost of living is about to shape our politics in a way that it hasn’t for decades.  You can spot the buildup this week, from Keir Starmer’s warning of a crisis to Tory backbenchers clamouring for Johnson to act now on high fuel bills. And you can already see the misery in the stories about how Britons now wrap themselves up in blankets and turn on their hairdryers to keep warm, rather than run the central heating. Over the next few weeks, the crisis will only grow. On 7 February the energy watchdog, Ofgem, sets the new maximum price for energy bills. Utility firm bosses are warning that the cap could easily go above £2,000, twice what it was last winter. Experts at the National Energy Action charity have warned that fuel poverty could rise to its highest levels since John Major was in No 10, with about 6 million households having to choose between heating and eating, or paying the bus fare or buying sanitary pads. This means 2 million households, which as recently as last autumn were still keeping their heads above water, will sink when the new cap kicks in on 1 April. At just that point, taxes go up too. National insurance will rise, as will council tax across much of the country, alongside a stealth increase in income tax bills. Put all that together and the Resolution Foundation warns that the average household stands to lose an extra £1,200 a year. To this we can add the effect of higher petrol prices. These bills will pile up while wages and benefits are falling in real terms. It is a recipe for widespread deprivation and massive political turbulence. It also blows apart the electoral coalition that handed Johnson his landslide. In true-blue Woking, only 6% of households are in fuel poverty; in Workington, by contrast, which went Tory only in 2019, that proportion is nearly 14%. My bet has long been that boring old economics will inflict far more damage on Boris Johnson than baroque politics. Most critics of the Sun King have spent the days since 2019 attacking his rule-breaking, his brinkmanship with Brussels, his sheer bad behaviour. Until the revelations about the parties at No 10, hardly any of it landed with a public that is wearily well used to a political class trashing norms to fill its boots; just ask the Right Hon Member for Greensill Capital. But all those voters, left unmoved by 42-point headlines and stinging op-eds, are far more likely to be mobilised by the largest tax burden in 70 years, swingeing cuts to frontline services and surging inflation. No wonder the government can barely quell its anxiety. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has been meeting energy bosses in a series of emergency summits, the latest held on Wednesday, while Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s team has been grumbling to journalists about having to stump up for any of this. Still, with only a month to go before the Ofgem announcement, no deal is on the table.What’s odd is that Johnson has himself pledged one such remedy. Co-writing an article in the Sun less than a month before the EU referendum of 2016, he vowed that Brexit would mean the end of VAT on fuel bills. “We will be able to scrap this unfair and damaging tax,” Mr Leave wrote . “It isn’t right that unelected bureaucrats in Brussels impose taxes on the poorest and elected British politicians can do nothing.” A whole two and a half years since becoming prime minister, he has done precisely nothing. This week he squirmed on TV that cutting VAT was a “blunt instrument” that wouldn’t direct help towards those in most dire financial need. Fancy that! If only someone had warned us that this guy reneges on a bet. But if Starmer wants to capitalise on this moment, he needs to do far better than make nothingy speeches larded with abstract nouns and bedecked with flags. Labour wants to scrap the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, but in truth it’s small change: £10 back on a £200 monthly bill. Better would be to call for a windfall tax on gas and oil companies, which have been making a killing as fuel prices rise, and direct that money to the least well-off. If Labour can take that position early and loud enough, they’ll reap rewards when the Tories copy them. They can also point to the failures of the energy market ­– the collapse of 26 suppliers and the consolidation of their customer base back into the hands of the big six – as grounds to try something new: to use the public sector to direct more investment into nationally secure renewables. This is a generation of politicians that has never faced an inflation shock but is nevertheless haunted by the mythology around what happened in the 1970s. With good reason: Thatcher used that episode finally to dismantle the Keynesian welfare state and to exile the left for more than a decade. The right is already reheating those old arguments about how inflation and higher interest rates must mean reduced public spending, and how taxpayers don’t want to pay for “green crap” and reducing poverty. It is essential that the left counter those points now. This isn’t the 70s, and there is no danger of a wage-price spiral. This is a workforce that has just emerged from the worst squeeze on living standards since Napoleon marched across Europe – and it is just about to enter another one. It’s not the labour force that isn’t working: it’s the markets and the supply chain. Those are what need to be fixed.

1/6/2022,"Novak Djokovic’s attempts to compete at the Australian Open this month were thrown into fresh doubt on Wednesday amid a spiralling outcry over his controversial “medical exemption” agreed by the tournament’s organisers. The whereabouts of the world No 1 and reigning Australian champion were in doubt after he was held up at passport control at Tullamarine airport in Melbourne, the host city of the tournament, for several hours late at night.  The Victoria state government said it had refused to formally support Djokovic’s visa application and it was reported that the visa with which he attempted to enter Australia does not allow for exemptions for unvaccinated applicants. The exact grounds for Djokovic’s exemption are unclear, although his opposition to vaccination is well known, fuelling the criticism inside Melbourne, Victoria and across Australia. Djokovic is seeking to win his 21st grand slam singles title, overtaking Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, at the tournament beginning on 17 January. Scott Morrison, the Australian prime minister, added his voice to the furore, saying Djokovic’s presence in Melbourne was still not certain and he would be “on the next plane home” if he is unable to provide proof of his medical exemption. “If that evidence is insufficient, then he won’t be treated any different to anyone else and he’ll be on the next plane home. There should be no special rules for Novak Djokovic at all. None whatsoever.” Victorian officials were asked by the federal authorities to formally support Djokovic’s visa application, which led Jaala Pulford, the state’s acting sports minister, to announce on Twitter that the state would not be doing so. “The federal government has asked if we will support Novak Djokovic’s visa application to enter Australia,” Pulford said. “We will not be providing Novak Djokovic with individual visa application support to participate in the 2022 Australian Open grand slam [tournament]. We’ve always been clear on two points: visa approvals are a matter for the federal government, and medical exemptions are a matter for doctors.” Djokovic announced on Tuesday that he would be flying to Australia after receiving an “exemption permission”, rather than vaccinating himself against Covid, immediately prompting backlash from the Australian public and politicians. As the nine-times Australian Open champion embarked on his journey to Melbourne, criticism of him hardened. Karen Andrews, the federal home affairs minister, released a statement suggesting the federal government could revoke Djokovic’s exemption unless he provided “acceptable proof” of the reasons for his medical exemption at the border. “Any individual seeking to enter Australia must comply with our strict border requirements,” Andrews wrote. “While the Victorian government and Tennis Australia may permit a non-vaccinated player to compete in the Australian Open, it is the Commonwealth government that will enforce our requirements at the Australian border.” Victorians have endured lengthy lockdowns and there is significant anxiety about rising Covid cases as Australia struggles with the Omicron surge. On Wednesday Victoria recorded a record 17,636 new cases and a rise in hospitalisations, prompting non-urgent elective surgeries to be reduced. Additionally, Morrison’s government is under fire for its handling of Covid and his refusal to make basic provisions free or affordable. Simple lateral flow tests are sold out at supermarkets and pharmacies across the city, most available are sold for around A$30 (£16) and others have been subject to price gouging from some companies. The Australian tennis legend Rod Laver said in an interview with the Herald Sun, stating that Djokovic should reveal the reason he was granted a medical exemption. “If he’s got a reason for [the exemption] then … we should know it,” Laver said. “Yes, you’re a great player and you’ve performed and won so many tournaments, so, it can’t be physical. So what is the problem?” Djokovic’s fellow world No 1, Ashleigh Barty, was asked about Djokovic after her opening match of the season in Adelaide. Barty noted the difficulties faced in Victoria but she declined to wade into the debate around Djokovic. “I know how hard it has been for Australians all around our nation, but in particular Victorians have had a real rough trot over the last 18 months and two years,” Barty said. “I understand why they may be frustrated with the decision. Ultimately I have no interest in speaking about Novak’s medical history. It’s not my decision. Those decisions are made. They’re completely out of my control.” Shortly after Djokovic announced his “exemption permission”, Tennis Australia clarified that Djokovic had been granted a medical exemption and that his application was reviewed by two separate independent medical panels, firstly from Tennis Australia and then provided by the Victorian government. The personal information of each applicant was redacted. Craig Tiley, the Tennis Australia chief executive, revealed 26 tennis players and support staff had applied for exemptions with only a handful receiving them. On Wednesday Tiley continued to emphasise the robustness of the process that led to Djokovic receiving an exception but he acknowledged the public’s frustrations. “Some of you will be upset about the fact that Novak has come in because of his statements of the past couple of years around vaccination,” Tiley said. “However, it’s ultimately up to him to discuss with the public his condition if you choose to do that, and the reason why he received an exemption. We as an event, also as a state, as a country, will do everything we possibly can to give everyone an equal opportunity to come into the country.” Last year Djokovic said he was “opposed to vaccination” and added: “I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel … But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision.”",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic’s Australian Open participation in doubt over visa row,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/05/novak-djokovics-australian-open-participation-in-doubt-over-visa-row
1/6/2022,"My grandmother Maureen Byrne, who has died aged 86 of lung cancer, was devoted to her family and was a much-loved member of the Irish community in Wood Green, north London. She was a devout Catholic and followed the words often attributed to Mother Teresa: “If you want to change the world, go home and love your family.” Born Ann Dalton in Cabra, Dublin, but always known as Maureen, she was one of nine children of Annie (nee Foy) and Michael Dalton, a tailor. Two siblings died in infancy and her mother died when Maureen was 10.  Maureen was educated in Dublin. She was always fiercely protective of her siblings. According to family legend, once, when her sister Carmel was bullied at school aged eight, Maureen, just a year or two older, confronted the perpetrators. At the age of 18 she contracted tuberculosis and spent three years in isolation. After recovering, in the late 1950s Maureen joined thousands who moved from Ireland to London in search of work. She took various jobs, including, for a time, at a chocolate factory. In 1960, while visiting her brother, Maureen went to the Queen Adelaide pub, Shepherd’s Bush, where she met the head barman, a quiet Waterford man named Tony Byrne. They married in 1960 and settled in Wood Green. Tony worked as a cleaner on the London Underground. Maureen and Tony had five children. When they had all started school she went to work part-time at Zetters football pools in Clerkenwell. As the children grew up and married, Maureen loved their wives, husbands and partners as though they were her own. She went to St Paul’s Catholic church in Wood Green for more than 60 years and made many friends in the Irish community. At the local community centre Maureen joined other women of a similar age; they encouraged each other to take up exercise and they all enjoyed the companionship on offer. Maureen was an avid watcher of Coronation Street and Emmerdale, and a fan of Catherine Cookson novels. She loved to entertain people and to make them laugh, enjoyed a pint of lager, and had a keen sense of mischief. When asked by a grandchild why she never went to confession, Maureen responded: “I have never sinned, so I have nothing to confess.” In recent years Maureen had suffered from thyroid illness and diabetes, and underwent heart surgery. She was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2018. She never loast her zest for life or her sense of fun. Maureen is survived by Tony, their five children, nine grandchildren, five great-grandchildren, and by a brother, Kieran, and sister, Carmel.",News/UK news,Maureen Byrne obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/maureen-byrne-obituary
