4/9/2022,"Although the UK no longer faces the threat of lockdowns or intensive care units being imminently overrun, coronavirus is still disrupting much of society and the economy. As Britain learns to live with Covid, the virus is still playing havoc with our daily lives, and these difficulties have been compounded by post-Brexit chaos in some in sectors. The resurgence of Covid-19 may not be causing the same number of deaths as before, but it is still causing widespread problems. Medical professionals and healthcare providers alike hoped that 2022 would be the year they got back on track, after two years of cancelled operations, delayed treatments and missed screenings. But the pressure on hospitals and other healthcare settings remains intense. In England, the rate of Covid-19 hospital admissions – 20.5 per 100,000 people – is now at its highest point since January 2021. It is the fifth successive weekly increase. The number of people in hospital seriously ill with Covid-19 remains very low – 315 patients are in mechanical ventilator beds – and almost three in five patients (58%) who have tested positive for Covid-19 are being treated primarily for something else. However, all patients who test positive must be treated separately from other people in hospital, adding to pressures faced by NHS staff who are already trying to clear a record backlog of routine treatment. With more than 20,000 patients with Covid-19 now occupying hospital beds in the UK, finding space for others who urgently need care is a daily logistical nightmare. Healthcare workers are also increasingly becoming infected, which means there are fewer staff to treat patients. The number of NHS staff at hospitals in England off work due to Covid-19 has risen for the fourth week in a row, with an average of 28,560 either ill or having to self-isolate every day in the last week. In many cases, the NHS has tried to switch to alternative methods of delivering care, such as home-based services, multi-month prescriptions and telemedicine. Inevitably, though, treatment for the most serious health problems, such as cancer, still requires hospital bed and a team of medical staff that are fit and healthy. The Easter holidays arrived this year with more sighs of relief than usual for teachers and school leaders in England. It offered them relief from the toll of Covid-related staff shortages, pupil absences and closures. For head teachers, “living with Covid” has meant juggling staff absence levels as high as at any time in the pandemic. The most recent figures published by the Department for Education (DfE) show that secondary schools have been worst affected, with 8.7% of teachers absent on the last day of March. Overall, one in five schools had more than 15% of their teachers absent. The absences come at a critical time, with GCSEs and A-levels starting on 16 May. Many schools have responded by getting available staff to concentrate on year 11 and year 13 students preparing for exams, and using supply teachers – when available – to cover other years. The worst-hit schools have sent non-exam year groups home to study remotely. Primary schools also face tests, with national assessments, or Sats, for year 6 pupils to go ahead from 9 May, despite protests from school leaders. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said he could sense “deep frustration” among his members, with Covid infections circulating in schools even as the government stopped access to free tests on 1 April. “We all assumed ‘living with Covid’ meant there would be very low case levels – this is clearly not the case, and absence rates remain at concerningly highlevels. School leaders feel they have been abandoned,” Whiteman said. Although cases within state schools have receded, the DfE’s latest figures still showed 120,000 confirmed Covid infections at the end of March. But when pupils return after Easter Covid absences will be a mystery: the department announced this week that it will stop collecting detailed responses about how many children missed school because of Covid. It has been an exceptionally difficult couple of years for the farming sector, which has faced a host of Brexit and Covid-related shocks and trade restrictions compounded by a dismissive government. The latter was typified by Boris Johnson suggesting it did not matter if 100,000 pigs were culled on-farm and not able to enter the food chain due to labour shortages in abattoirs, as they would have been killed anyway to make “bacon sandwiches”. This week, MPs said the Covid pandemic and restrictions on recruiting overseas labour had resulted in half a million job vacancies in the food and farming sector, with acute shortages of skilled butchers and abattoir workers. The government’s indifferent response to the crisis, including a temporary short-term visa scheme that was introduced too late to be beneficial, meant crops were left unharvested and rotting in the fields, and healthy animals were culled on-farm, said MPs. Feed, fuel and fertiliser costs were rising even before the invasion of Ukraine, with high shipping costs dating back to disruption from the pandemic. This resulted in a rise in the price of commodities such as organic soy used to feed cows, pigs and chickens. And the promised benefits of post-Brexit trade are yet to materialise, with UK food exports falling last year. While UK businesses are treated as a third country by the EU, with additional paperwork and subsequent delays and costs, for EU exporters it is almost as if the UK had never left the single market. The delays to trade are particularly difficult for products with a shorter shelf life such as sea fish and dairy. For now, the UK’s food sector appears burdened by a combination of wage rises, price increases and, it is feared, food production being exported abroad. Restaurants and bars heaving with customers during weekends may make it seem like the hospitality industry has recovered from the pandemic, but many businesses are struggling with a Covid hangover. Debts incurred over the past two years must be repaid while the industry deals with rising fuel and product prices – as well as a hike in staffing costs. Other firms did not survive two years of drastically reduced custom. Figures from the industry analysts AlixPartners, published in January, show a net loss of 8,228 hospitality venues during 2021 – a 7% fall. The pandemic’s impact has not been felt evenly across the high street. Pizza and burger restaurants were among the worst hit, with Italian chains shrinking by a net 22% or 448 sites. However, there are encouraging signs that independent restaurants are taking advantage of cheap rent deals and private equity interest, with an increase of 3.7% or 888 sites. Data from bookings platform OpenTable shows that in March bookings exceeded levels for the same period in 2019, as people flocked to restaurants and bars to make up for missed opportunities to socialise. Britain’s love of a takeaway has endured during the pandemic recovery, too, with a boom in orders for the likes of Crosstown and German Doner Kebab. An estimated 10% to 20% of restaurants’ business is now made up of delivery income. But the withdrawal of government support for the hospitality industry in the spring statement has angered restaurant and pub bosses, who wanted to see ministers extend a cut in VAT to 12.5%, since the recovery remains fragile. Consumers have also observed how eating and drinking out is not as cheap as it was before the pandemic, while high inflation and the cost of living crisis means that people will be looking to cut out luxuries. For pub, bar, restaurant and cafe owners, the uncertainty isn’t over yet. Airports are showing the most visible signs of a travel sector ill-equipped to deal with resurgent demand for holidays after the pandemic, with lengthy queues at Heathrow and scenes verging on chaos at Manchester. The sudden lifting of all Covid restrictions by the UK government has opened the floodgates for foreign travel bookings – and unleashed a wave of staff infections. Airlines such as easyJet and, to a lesser extent, British Airways have had to cancel hundreds of flights due to a lack of crew. While the aviation industry had long argued for all testing and locator forms to be scrapped, it was caught on the hop when the government did so at short notice last month. Thousands of staff had either been laid off or left since March 2020, and airports such as Manchester are finding it hard to lure them back. The labour market has changed, and short-staffed sectors such as logistics or warehousing can be more attractive than antisocial shifts in security lines or baggage handling. New hires for airport jobs also have to be vetted by a government service now dealing with a flood of applications – and the process can take months even in quiet times. While the UK has scrapped Covid travel rules, most other countries have not: BA says that around two-thirds of its destinations still require vaccination certificates or other documentation that need to be manually checked, increasing waits at check-in or border controls. Brexit red tape is also lengthening the 20-mile queues at the Channel. Thousands of lorries are parked on the M20 towards Dover, while a recent customs IT meltdown added to delays. The death spiral of reduced trade with the EU and the pandemic curbs on travel seeded P&O Ferries’ desperate, brazen sacking of 800 crew, leaving services suspended and intensifying hold-ups this Easter.",News/World news,"As Britain learns to live with Covid, it faces a new pandemic of disruption",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/as-britain-learns-to-live-with-covid-it-faces-a-new-pandemic-of-disruption
4/9/2022,"A majority of French people feel the 2022 presidential election campaign has been poor quality and never really got off the ground, which could lead to protest votes and a historically low turn-out in Sunday’s first round, pollsters and analysts have said. An Ifop poll this month found 80% of French people felt the campaign was “poor quality”. Voters have complained of a lack of new political ideas or vision, and few solutions to their problems, after two years of the Covid pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and a cost-of-living crisis. Emmanuel Macron is campaigning to become the first French president in 20 years to win re-election, promising to continue to lower taxes, raise the pension age to 65, and get France to full employment after decades of mass joblessness. But he entered the race late, focusing instead on diplomacy with Vladimir Putin, and has seen his poll lead slip slightly in recent days while the far-right’s Marine Le Pen closes the gap in second place. Le Pen has focused on the cost of living crisis, while her anti-immigration programme would ban the Muslim head-scarf from all public places. The hard-left Jean-Luc Mélenchon is also rising in the polls, promising to freeze prices and overhaul the presidential system. Despite French voters’ main concerns – the cost-of-living crisis, the war in Ukraine and the environment – there has been less interest in this campaign than in the last presidential election five years ago. There have been fewer rallies, and voters have complained there was no direct TV debate between all candidates. As the first-round campaign entered its final week, 54% of people said they felt it hadn’t really started yet. An unprecedented number of French voters say they are unsure who to vote for and abstention could hit a record high of up to 30% on Sunday. Macron has tried to mobilise his voters by likening the political mood to that in the UK before the 2016 Brexit vote. There’s “no certainty,” he warned at his only rally, in Nanterre outside Paris, brushing aside his lead in the polls. “Don’t believe in polls or commentators who sound definitive and tell you that … the election is already done, that everything is going to be alright. From Brexit to so many elections, what seems unlikely can happen!” Macron later told a radio interviewer he felt society was “fatigued by two years of Covid” and “stunned” by the war in Ukraine. He argued that “real topics” had indeed been discussed in the campaign, saying “war is a real topic!” but he conceded there was “a collective questioning on whether voting still makes sense.” He argued voting was crucial. Pollsters say the fact that this election was for months seen as a foregone conclusion – that Macron would easily win – could impact turn-out and choices, and create a sense of voters wanting to prove predictions wrong. A total of 66% of French people currently believe Macron will win – a figure that has dropped in recent weeks as Le Pen’s support has risen. The sense of fatigue and foregone-conclusion has drawn comparisons with the 2002 election “earthquake” 20 years ago, when Le Pen’s father, the far-right Jean-Marie Le Pen, knocked out the left to reach the final against Jacques Chirac. “Just like today, in 2002 there was a constant feeling of a campaign that didn’t work, which in turn created a temptation towards a protest vote,” said François Miquet-Marty, head of Viavoice pollsters. “Our polling shows 75% of French people think there aren’t really any new ideas in this campaign. And at the same time, 76% of people are worried about their children’s futures. There is a sense that the solutions on offer in this campaign aren’t enough.” French media and analysts have described the campaign as putting voters to sleep in a country already worn out by crises. The Communist candidate Fabien Roussel this week described the campaign “as on morphine”. Jean Lassalle, a south-western lawmaker running on rural issues, told a TV interviewer in February: “This campaign is shit” and the clip has circulated widely ever since. Early campaigning began last autumn amid the Omicron wave of Covid infections. Then the surprise rise of the far-right TV pundit Éric Zemmour initially pushed the issue of national identity to the top of the agenda. But the war in Ukraine ultimately dominated headlines. Macron postponed his own start to campaigning, initially benefiting from a kind of “rally round the flag” boost in the polls. Currently, Macron has dipped, although he holds a lead, while Le Pen and Mélenchon are rising and Zemmour has sunk back in the polls.",News/World news,"French presidential election could see historically low turn-out, pollsters say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/french-presidential-election-could-see-historically-low-turn-out-pollsters-say
4/9/2022,"Vladimir Putin was annoyed – or maybe just bored. The Russian leader had been patiently fielding questions from a small group of international journalists in the restaurant of a modest hotel in Davos. Then one of the queries seemed to irritate him. He stared back at the questioner, an American, and said slowly, through an interpreter: “I’ll answer that question in a minute. But first let me ask you about the extraordinary ring you have on your finger.” All heads in the room swivelled. “Why is the stone so large?” Putin continued. A few of the audience began to giggle and the journalist looked uncomfortable. Putin took on a tone of mock sympathy and continued: “You surely don’t mind me asking, because you wouldn’t be wearing something like that unless you were trying to draw attention to yourself?” There was more laughter. By now, the original question had been forgotten. It was a masterclass in distraction and bullying. The year was 2009, and Putin had already been in power for almost a decade. But this was my first encounter with him in the flesh, during his visit to the World Economic Forum. Putin’s ability to radiate menace, without raising his voice, was striking. But so was the laughter of his audience. Despite the violence of his Russian government – as demonstrated in Chechnya and Georgia – western opinion-formers were still inclined to treat him as a pantomime villain. I was reminded of this just before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a televised meeting at the Kremlin with his closest advisers, Putin toyed with Sergei Naryshkin, the head of his foreign intelligence service – making the feared securocrat look like a stuttering fool. The pleasure he took in humiliating somebody in front of an audience was once again on display. But this time, nobody was laughing. Putin was about to plunge Europe into its biggest land war since 1945. Russian troops launched a full-scale invasion on 24 February. Within a month, more than 10 million Ukrainians had fled their homes, thousands of troops and civilians had been killed and the coastal city of Mariupol had been destroyed. Even though western intelligence services had warned for months that Russia was poised to attack, many experienced Putin-watchers, both in Russia and the west, refused to believe it. After more than 20 years of his leadership, they felt that they understood Putin. He was ruthless and violent, no doubt, but he was also believed to be rational, calculating and committed to Russia’s integration into the world economy. Few believed he was capable of such a reckless gamble. Looking back, however, it is clear that the outside world has consistently misread him. From the moment he took power, outsiders too often saw what they wanted and played down the darkest sides of Putinism. In fact, the outside world’s indulgence of Putin went much further than simply turning a blind eye to his excesses. For a rising generation of strongman leaders and cultural conservatives outside Russia, Putin became something of a hero and a role model. As his admirers saw it, the Russian leader had inherited a country humiliated by the breakup of the Soviet Union. Through strength and cunning, he had restored its status and global power, and even regained some of the territory lost when the USSR broke up. And he had delighted nationalists and populists the world over by successfully defying self-righteous American liberals such as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. Dmitry Peskov, Putin’s spokesman, was not simply spouting propaganda when he said in 2018: “There’s a demand in the world for special, sovereign leaders, for decisive ones … Putin’s Russia was the starting point.” The Putin fanclub has had numerous members in the west over the years. Rudy Giuliani, President Trump’s close adviser and lawyer, expressed admiration for Putin’s annexation of Crimea, remarking: “He makes a decision and he executes it, quickly. That’s what you call a leader.” Nigel Farage, the former leader of Ukip and the Brexit party, and a friend of Donald Trump, once named Putin the world leader he most admired, adding: “The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant. Not that I approve of him politically.” Matteo Salvini, the leader of the populist right Northern League party and a former deputy prime minister of Italy, flaunted his admiration for the Russian leader by being photographed in a Putin T-shirt in Red Square. Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, has said, “My favourite hero is Putin.” Most important of all, Xi Jinping is also a confirmed admirer. A week after being appointed as president of China in early 2013, Xi made his first state visit overseas – choosing to visit Putin in Moscow. On 4 February 2022, just 20 days before the invasion of Ukraine, Putin met Xi in Beijing for their 38th summit meeting. Shortly afterwards, Russia and China announced a “no limits” partnership. As the joint Russian-Chinese statement made clear, the two leaders are united in their hostility to American global power and to the pro-democracy “colour revolutions” they accuse Washington of stirring up around the world – from Ukraine to Hong Kong. Putin and Xi are both strongman rulers who have centralised power around themselves and encouraged a cult of personality. They are, as Alexander Gabuev, a Russian academic, puts it, “the tsar and the emperor”. Whether this partnership of strongmen will survive the Russian invasion of Ukraine is now one of the most important questions in international politics. Putin was sworn into office as president of Russia on 31 December 1999. But at first it was not obvious that he would last very long in the job, let alone that he would emerge as the most aggressive challenger to the western liberal order and the pioneer of a new model of authoritarian leadership. As the chaotic Yeltsin era of the 1990s drew to a close, Putin’s ascent to the top job was eased by his former colleagues in the KGB. But he also had the approval of Russia’s richest and most powerful people, the oligarchs, who saw him as a capable administrator and “safe pair of hands” who would not threaten established interests. Viewed from the west, Putin looked relatively reassuring. In his first televised speech from the Kremlin, given on New Year’s Eve 1999, just a few hours after taking over from Yeltsin, Putin promised to “protect freedom of speech, freedom of conscience, freedom of the mass media, ownership rights, these fundamental elements of a civilised society”. In March 2000, he won his first presidential election and proudly asserted: “We have proved that Russia is becoming a modern democratic state.” When Bill Clinton met Putin in the Kremlin for the first time, in June 2000, he declared his Russian counterpart “fully capable of building a prosperous, strong Russia, while preserving freedom and pluralism and the rule of law”. Yet while Putin may initially have found it convenient to use the rhetoric of liberal democracy, his early actions as president told a different story. In his first year in office, he moved immediately to rein in independent sources of power, to assert the central authority of the state and to use warfare to bolster his own personal position – all actions that were to become hallmarks of Putinism. The escalation of the war in Chechnya made Putin seem like a nationalist hero, standing up for Russian interests and protecting the ordinary citizen from terrorism. In an early move that alarmed liberals, the new president reinstated the old Soviet national anthem. His promises to protect media freedom turned out to be empty: Russia’s few independent television networks were brought under government control. As Putin established himself in office, the image-makers got to work crafting a strongman persona for him. Gleb Pavlovsky, one of Putin’s first spin doctors, later described him as a “quick learner” and a “talented actor”. Key images were placed in the Russian media and around the world: Putin on horseback, Putin practising judo, Putin arm-wrestling or strolling bare-chested by a river in Siberia. These photographs attracted mockery from intellectuals and cynics. But the president’s handlers were clear-eyed. As Pavlovsky later told the Washington Post, the goal was to ensure that “Putin corresponds ideally to the Hollywood image of a saviour-hero”. In any case, Russians were more than ready for a strongman to ride to their rescue. The collapse of the Soviet system in 1991 had allowed for the emergence of democracy and freedom of speech. But as the economy atrophied and then fell apart, many experienced a severe drop in living standards and personal security. By 1999, life expectancy for Russian men had fallen by three and a half years to below 60. A UN report attributed this to a “rise in self-destructive behaviour”, which it linked to “rising poverty rates, unemployment and financial insecurity”. Under those circumstances, a decisive leader who promised to turn back the clock had real appeal. Long before Trump promised to “make America great again”, Putin was promising to bring back the stability and pride of the Soviet era to those Russians who had lost out in the 1990s. But his nostalgia was not restricted to the social cohesion of Soviet times. Putin also yearned to restore some of the USSR’s lost international clout. In a speech in 2005, Putin labelled the collapse of the Soviet Union “the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century”. As the years have passed, he has become increasingly preoccupied by Russian history. In the summer of 2021, he published a long essay entitled On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians – which, even at the time, some saw as a manifesto for invasion. Delving through centuries of history, Putin attempted to prove that Ukraine was an artificial state and that “Russia was robbed, indeed” when Ukraine gained independence in 1991. Fyodor Lukyanov, an academic who is close to the Russian leader, told me in 2019 that one of Putin’s enduring fears was the loss of Russia’s status as one of the world’s great powers for the first time in centuries. His resentment at what he regarded as American slights and betrayals set Putin on a collision course with the west. A landmark moment came with a speech he gave at the Munich Security Conference in 2007. That speech was a direct challenge to the west and an expression of cold fury. He accused the US of an “almost uncontained hyper use of force – military force – in international relations, force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts”. The Putin of 2000, who had expressed pride at Russia’s transformation into a modern democracy, had given way to a man who denounced western talk of freedom and democracy as a hypocritical front for power politics. The Munich speech was not just an angry reflection on the past. It also pointed the way to the future. The Russian president had put the west on notice that he intended to fight back against the US-led world order. It foreshadowed a lot of what was to come: Russia’s military intervention in Georgia in 2008, its annexation of Crimea in 2014, its dispatch of troops to Syria in 2015, its meddling in the US presidential election of 2016. All of these actions burnished Putin’s reputation as a nationalist and a strong leader. They also made him an icon for strongmen throughout the world who rejected western leadership and the “liberal international order”. This indictment of the west goes back to the 1990s. It is argued repeatedly in Moscow that the expansion of Nato to take in countries of the former Soviet empire (including Poland and the Baltic states) was a direct contradiction of promises made after the end of the cold war. Nato’s intervention in the Kosovo war of 1998‑9 added to the list of grievances proving, in the Kremlin’s eyes, both that Nato is an aggressor and that western talk of respecting sovereignty and state borders was nothing but hypocrisy. Russians were not reassured by the western riposte that Nato was acting in response to ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses by Serbia. As one liberal Russian politician put it to me in 2008, in a moment of frankness: “We know we have committed human rights abuses in Chechnya. If Nato can bomb Belgrade for that, why could they not bomb Moscow?” Putin’s case against Nato also takes in the Iraq war launched by the US and many of its allies in 2003. For him, the massive bloodshed in Iraq was proof that the west’s self-proclaimed pursuit of “democracy and freedom” only brings instability and suffering in its wake. If you mention the brutal behaviour of Russian forces in Chechnya or Syria in Moscow, you will always have the Iraq war thrown back in your face. Crucially, the west’s promotion of democracy has posed a direct threat to Putin’s own political and personal survival. From 2003 to 2005, pro-democracy “colour revolutions” broke out in many of the states of the former Soviet Union – including Ukraine, Georgia and Kyrgyzstan. If demonstrators in Independence Square in Kyiv could bring down an autocratic government in Ukraine, what was to stop the same happening in Red Square? In Russia, many believed it was a “fairytale” that these were spontaneous uprisings. As a former intelligence operative whose entire professional career had involved running “black operations”, Putin was particularly inclined to see the CIA as pulling the strings. The goal, as the Kremlin saw it, was to install pro-western puppet regimes. Russia itself could be next. The shock of the Iraq war and the colour revolutions were the recent experiences that informed Putin’s Munich speech in 2007. And, as the Kremlin saw it, this pattern of western misdeeds continued. Putin points to the western powers’ 2011 intervention in Libya that resulted in the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi – something he believes they had promised they would not do. That episode is a particularly sore spot for Putin, since it took place during the four years from 2008 to 2012 when he was serving in the lesser job of prime minister, having stepped aside as president in favour of his acolyte Dmitry Medvedev. As Putin’s supporters see it, a naive Medvedev was duped into supporting a UN resolution that allowed for a limited intervention, only for western powers to exceed their mandate in order to overthrow and kill Gaddafi. They have no time for the response that the Libyan intervention was made on human rights grounds, but that events then took on a life of their own, as the Libyan rebellion gained steam. Medvedev’s alleged naivety in allowing the Libyan intervention proved useful for Putin, however: it established the idea that he was indispensable as Russia’s leader. Any substitute, even one chosen by Putin, would leave the country vulnerable to a scheming and ruthless west. In 2011, Putin announced that he intended to return as president, after the potential presidential term had been extended to two consecutive periods of six years. This announcement provoked rare public demonstrations in Moscow and other cities, which again fanned Putin’s fears about western schemes to undermine his power. I was in Moscow in January 2012 and witnessed the marches and banners, some of which carried pointed references to Gaddafi’s fate. Putin understood the parallels. He commented publicly about how disgusted he had been by the footage of Gaddafi’s murder – which perhaps reflected a certain concern about his own potential fate. The fact that Hillary Clinton, then America’s Secretary of State, expressed public support for the 2012 demonstrations was deeply resented by Putin and may have justified, in his mind, Russia’s efforts to undermine Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016. Putin secured his re-election, but his sense that the west remained a threat to Russia was further stoked by events in Ukraine in 2013-14. The prospect of that country signing an association agreement with the European Union was seen as a serious threat in the Kremlin, since it would pull Russia’s most important neighbour – once an integral part of the USSR – into the west’s sphere of influence. Under pressure from Moscow, the Ukrainian government of President Viktor Yanukovych reversed course. But this provoked another popular uprising in Kyiv, forcing Yanukovych to flee. The loss of a compliant ally in Kyiv was a major geopolitical reverse for the Kremlin. Putin’s response was to dramatically raise the stakes, by crossing the line into the use of military force. In February 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea, a region that was part of Ukraine but had belonged to Russia until 1954 and was populated largely by Russian-speakers. It was also, by agreement with the Ukrainians, the home of Russia’s Black Sea fleet. In the west, the annexation of Crimea, along with Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine, was seen as a flagrant violation of international law that many feared could be the prelude to further acts of aggression. But in Russia, the annexation was widely greeted as a triumph – it represented the nation’s fightback. Putin’s approval ratings in independent opinion polls soared to over 80%. In the immediate afterglow, he came closer to achieving the ultimate goal of the strongman ruler: the complete identification of the nation with the leader. Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of the Russian parliament, exulted: “If there’s Putin, there’s Russia. If there’s no Putin, there’s no Russia.” Putin himself crowed that Crimea had been taken without a shot being fired. The west’s response was to slap economic sanctions on Russia. But western indignation did not last long. Four years later, Russia hosted a successful World Cup. At the final, Putin sat with the presidents of France and Croatia, two EU nations, in the VIP box in Moscow. The ease with which Putin annexed Crimea – and the swiftness with which the west seemed prepared to forgive – may have laid the ground for an unjustified confidence that led to the invasion of Ukraine. His overreach is also a reminder of the flaws in the strongman model of leadership. Decades in office can cause a leader to succumb to megalomania or paranoia. The elimination of checks and balances, the centralisation of power and the promotion of a cult of personality make it more likely that a leader will make a disastrous mistake. For all these reasons, strongman rule is an inherently flawed and dangerous model of government. Tragically, that lesson is being learned all over again – in Russia and Ukraine. An invasion that was meant to secure Russia’s place as a great power and Putin’s place in history has clearly gone wrong. Putin is now involved in a brutal war of attrition. Western sanctions will see the Russian economy shrink dramatically this year, and the Russian middle-class is witnessing the disappearance of many of the consumer goods and travel opportunities that emerged with the end of the cold war. The unofficial goal of western policy is clearly to force Putin from power. But the endgame may not come as swiftly as we would like. Deeply entrenched in his decades-long mission, Putin is now even less likely to give up power voluntarily, since his successors might repudiate his policies, or even put him on trial. The prospects for popular uprising are equally poor, despite the many brave Russians who have indicated their disgust over the war. Any protests are likely to be swiftly crushed with violence and imprisonment, as they were in neighbouring Belarus in 2020 and 2021. A third scenario – the possibility of an enlightened group within the elite seizing power – seems out of reach, too. Organising a palace coup against Putin will be very difficult: all dissenters were purged from the Kremlin long ago. Putin also takes his personal security very seriously: several of his former bodyguards have become rich in their own right. While there will be many within Russia who are dismayed by the course that events have taken, orchestrating that diffuse discontent into a coherent plot looks like a formidable challenge. The difficult truth is that Putin’s strongman style has defined his rule over Russia – and despite his many crimes and misdemeanours, those same strongman tactics may preserve him in power for years to come.

4/9/2022,"After years of public pestering, Twitter has finally begun work on an edit button, the company announced this week. The ability to alter existing tweets has long been the platform’s most-requested feature, according to a vice-president, Jay Sullivan. But the company has expressed concerns that an edit button could be “misused to alter the record of the public conversation”. “Protecting the integrity of that public conversation is our top priority when we approach this work,” Sullivan wrote. Indeed, the new feature could be a boon for prominent tweeters who frequently put their foot in their mouth, digitally speaking. If the edit button had been around in years past, what might politicians, celebrities and influencers have gotten away with? What about the negative press @realDonaldTrump? #covfefe These days, Donald Trump is busy spouting indisputable facts on the very popular and very successful Truth Social – lotta people are saying it’s better than Facebook and Instagram and, frankly, the best social network ever created. But some readers may remember that the former president was once a Twitter user. Trump would adore the editing feature, which would allow him to claim that no, he never said that. “Covfefe”? You must have misread it – that was a warning about Covid, three years in advance. All those attacks on Barack Obama for golfing that you think you remember are, on review, sympathetic tweets saying that a president needs some downtime on the green. (Edits seem likely to be marked as such under the new feature, but Trump has never let documentation of falsehoods stand in his way.) pic.twitter.com/h3AVnWScBU In January, Tom Brady was doing “a lot of reflecting and asking myself difficult questions”, as he reported on Twitter on 1 February. That reflection led to a decision that “it’s best I leave the field of play to the next generation”. He must have done even more reflecting and posed even harder questions because 40 days later, he’d “realized my place is still on the field”. Twitter’s new feature could save him some embarrassment although it would be too late to stop the presses on Sports Illustrated “the GOAT says goodbye” special issues..

Was it a secret message to her friends in a conspiratorial underground network? A Sesame Street-esque tribute to her favorite letter? Did her cat just walk daintily across the keyboard? Perhaps she dropped one of the CBD gummies she now shills. It would be easy to edit this one to “lovely lovely horse”.

Unfortunately, among the smiling luminaries is one Kevin Spacey – a presence that has not aged well. An edit button might allow a quick re-upload of the photo, with the actor quietly replaced with a more beloved figure – maybe Anthony Fauci or the tiger from Encanto. Ed Balls And then there is the king of accidental tweets – that time in 2011 when Ed Balls, then the UK’s shadow chancellor, tweeted his own name in an effort to search for himself. To his credit, he hasn’t taken down the post, ensuring a legacy as a good sport and bad tweeter. An edit button could have recast the moment as Bob Dole-style bid for name recognition, using the third person to refer to himself: “Ed Balls listens to what the British people want.” Or he could have gone all in, writing Ed Balls 15 more times. Will Smith has to punch Chris Rock in the face .... He has no choice The slap heard round the world might have come as a surprise to you – but not to Jason. Jason, styled J A S O N, is a Twitter user and apparent prophet who tweeted in 2016 that Will Smith had “no choice” but to punch Chris Rock in the face. If this doesn’t impress you, imagine what Jason could do with an edit button. It’s Oscars night. You vaguely remember, six years ago, having seen someone tweet something about Smith and Rock. After 10 minutes of mad Googling, you land on Jason’s tweet. What once suggested Smith should punch Rock now says Smith will slap him. Maybe it even gives the date. Jason is immediately lauded as the next Nostradamus. Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured. Elon Musk must have wished for an edit button when US regulators sued him over a tweet saying he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured.” The SEC argued the tweet broke securities laws; funding was not, in fact, secured, but Tesla shares jumped. Ultimately, Musk and the agency settled the case and Musk stepped down as the electric vehicle company’s chair. The whole thing might have been avoided if Musk had just revised the tweet with a crying-laughing emoji, which is generally accepted in US courtrooms as an indicator that a defendant was totally joking. Notably, nobody said crime https://t.co/9ihSrJwWy6 When New York mayoral candidates were asked last year about what they’d ban if they could, their answers included food deserts and sugary drinks. The conservative commentator Ben Shapiro had a powerful rebuke: “Notably,” he tweeted, “nobody said crime.” Shapiro was apparently unaware that in most jurisdictions, crime is already illegal. An edit function would have allowed him to clarify that he meant true-crime shows, which he hates for their glorification of aggressive police tactics. judging by the surprising responses to the posting of a rash on my foot, one would think that most people have never seen rashes before, especially poison ivy/oak/sumac. (or was this GiantHogWeed?) perhaps people don't hike much any longer & never incur bizarre rashes... In a year of endless horror, the lauded writer Joyce Carol Oates sent a tweet that still managed to make waves: an image of her foot with a very, very disturbing rash. “Never/ever walk in the woods in sandals,” she warned. The tweet proves Twitter’s edit feature should also include a tool to blur images that don’t quite violate any platform policy but can never be unseen. Love is sharing a password. We were so innocent back in 2017. Sure, we had Trump and Brexit, but the pandemic was years away, the US Capitol remained un-stormed, and no one thought twice about sharing their Netflix passwords. Even the streaming company itself endorsed this behavior, writing in a tweet that “love is sharing a password”. A mere five years later, everything is horrible, including Netflix, which is investigating ways to charge people for sharing accounts. As soon as Twitter’s edit button appears, you can bet the company will prioritize its borderline socialist 2017 remark, changing it to something like “love is sharing a password exclusively with members of your own household, or we’re coming for you”. You can have an edit button when everyone wears a mask Maybe the real reason Twitter is launching an edit button is so it can edit its own mistakes. Last year, the company told those seeking the feature: “You can have an edit button when everyone wears a mask.” It’s unclear if this honorable sentiment was intended as a nudge toward good behavior or a comment akin to “when pigs fly”, but either way, the company has just disproved it.",News/Technology,Ten tweets in need of the new edit button: from covfefe to Oscars selfie,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/09/twitter-ten-tweets-in-need-of-edit-covfefe-oscars-selfie
4/9/2022,"27 March 1968Manchester City (without a league title since 1937) played away at Manchester United (without a league title since 1967) sitting two points behind both their local rivals and Leeds United. With only two points awarded for a win, they could not afford to lose, something that looked likely when George Best put the home side ahead inside 60 seconds. But City dominated thereafter, with Colin Bell, George Heslop and Francis Lee all scoring. The win inspired City to the title – though they were scooped two weeks later, when United became the first English team to win the European Cup. DH 14 April 1981Long before he became TalkSport’s bon viveur, Alan Brazil was a zippy striker for Bobby Robson’s Ipswich Town. On a Tuesday evening at Villa Park his goal set Ipswich on their way. Brazil’s strike, following a mistake from Villa defender Ken McNaught, was followed by Paul Mariner sending Eric Gates away to score the second. Gary Shaw scored Villa’s late consolation with five minutes to play and Ipswich had an advantage they celebrated raucously in the away dressing room. Defeats to Arsenal and Norwich in their next matches soon handed the reins back to Aston Villa, who became champions using just 14 players all season. JB 26 May 1989“The Liverpool players are down, absolutely abject. [John] Aldridge is down, [John] Barnes is down, [Kenny] Dalglish just stands there, [Steve] Nicol’s on his knees, [Steve] McMahon is on his knees.” Brian Moore, ITV’s peerless commentator, painted a picture of devastation in describing Liverpool’s reaction to Michael Thomas’s late goal at Anfield. That the game took place six weeks after the Hillsborough Disaster appears surreal now, a reminder of football’s relentless idiom that the game must always go on. George Graham, the Arsenal manager, tried briefly to stop his players celebrating too wildly, but in vain. The drama of their victory had proved overwhelming. JB 16 April 2003One of English football’s greatest rivalries was at its zenith – Arsenal had confirmed the previous year’s title at Old Trafford and looked certainties to retain it for most of the following season. But Manchester United reeled them in and were three points in front when the teams met at Highbury. Ruud van Nistelrooy opened the scoring but two Thierry Henry goals put Arsenal ahead, only for Ryan Giggs to equalise seconds after the Frenchman’s second. On the touchline, Arsène Wenger was furious, while at full time Sir Alex Ferguson saluted the away end as though his team had won, because he knew that, ultimately, they had. DH 30 April 2012For Sergio Agüero’s 93.20 strike against Queens Park Rangers to happen, Manchester City first needed to wrest control of the title race from United. Sir Alex Ferguson’s team, eight points ahead three weeks previously, were flagging, and he would admit mistakes with his team selection. Park Ji-sung was asked to do the running for Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs in midfield but his own engine sputtered as Yaya Touré, Gareth Barry and David Silva ran the old guard ragged. A crashing header on half-time from Vincent Kompany powered City to the top and towards a title they would win amid historic chaos. JB 3 January 2019It feels strange to call a game played on 3 January a title decider, but no more so than Liverpool winning 13 and drawing four of their last 17 to finish on 97 points … and in second place. When they travelled to the Etihad for the now traditional New Year’s Day fixture played not on New Year’s Day, they led Manchester City by seven. But, though Roberto Firmino cancelled out Sergio Agüero’s opener, Leroy Sané’s goal settled one of the finest games ever played in England. City went on to win 16 from 17 to take the title by a point.

4/9/2022,"The day the Russians arrived in the sleepy, windswept village of Staryi Bykiv, they killed six men. By the time they had departed 32 days later, the soldiers had carried out at least three more killings, destroyed the school, systematically looted dozens of houses and turned much of the central street into a wasteland of charred buildings and rubble. The images from Bucha, west of Kyiv, have shocked the world and intensified Ukrainian anger over the Russian invasion, but the story emerging in harder-to-access small towns and villages east of the Ukrainian capital suggests those war crimes are far from an anomaly. Novyi and Staryi Bykiv, two halves of one village separated by a small river, are about 50 miles east of Kyiv. Dotted with ramshackle cottages, their combined population is about 2,000. In normal times very little happens here: ducks waddle through the potholed streets, people work the fields or tend to their own small plots of land and livestock holdings. The Russian army entered the area on 27 February, three days into its invasion, as part of its drive towards Kyiv from three directions. When the advance stalled, they set up a base, moving in tanks, artillery and surface-to-air missile systems. The accounts given by dozens of residents in Staryi and Novyi Bykiv during a two-day visit by the Guardian paint a picture of a thieving, violent and demoralised invasion force that was confused about whether it was supposed to be liberating Ukrainians or destroying them. Finally allowed to walk around freely after a month of terror, men and women wandered the streets on Thursday still in a state of shock. In the car park outside the small village administration building in Novyi Bykiv, children gawped at the charred shells of two Russian armoured vehicles, one with the uniform of a Russian soldier still draped over one of its hatches. Older people aired their grief and their grievances to anyone who would listen as they picked up plastic bags of food aid. Recollections were frequently accompanied by tears from men and women, young and old. One elderly woman, wearing a bright green headscarf and brandishing a curved wooden walking stick, was incapable of answering questions, simply repeating in a wailing voice: “Woe! Woe! Woe!” Tamara and Petro Lysenko, a married couple in their 60s, gave a tour of their handsome cottage on the central street. Russian soldiers had broken in and lived there for several weeks while the Lysenkos cowered in a cellar with relatives. The Russians ate all the food, killed a piglet and several chickens, stole the washing machine and all of Petro’s clothes and a computer, smashed up the three family cars and daubed Z symbols in orange paint on the side of the fridge and the kitchen door. “I have been coming in and out for two days and I just don’t know what to do. It feels like it wasn’t my house they destroyed but my heart,” said Tamara, surveying the filthy floors and ransacked cupboards. Yet by the standards of the past month, the Lysenkos had been lucky. In the first hours after the Russians arrived, Viktoria Vovk’s large family was hiding in the cellar next to their house. Some relatives had arrived from towns closer to Kyiv; they had travelled here when the war started, making the reasonable assumption it would be safer than close to the capital. That turned out to be a terrible miscalculation. Vovk’s 29-year-old son Bohdan Hladky, a post office employee, and her brother-in-law Oleksandr Mohyrchuk, 39, a factory worker, left the cellar to breathe some fresh air and smoke a cigarette. A few minutes later Hladky’s wife, Olesia, heard raised voices and went up to see what was happening. The two men had disappeared. A neighbour came running from across the street. “The Russians have taken your boys,” he said, breathlessly. Olesia and Viktoria dashed to a spot on the main road where Russian soldiers were setting up a base, and begged for information. “These non-humans were standing there, we were asking them to let my son and my brother-in-law go. They said they would interrogate them and then let them go,” Vovk said, recalling the ordeal with difficulty. She said the Russian soldiers were speaking a “non-Slavic language” between themselves, leading her to believe they could be Chechens. An hour later the women heard gunshots from the area of the base. The next morning they again went to seek out the soldiers, and they saw three dead bodies in front of the building. At the back there were another three bodies, including those of Hladky and Mohyrchuk. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they had been shot in the head, Vovk said. For nine days the Russians did not allow the family to remove the bodies. Then, on 7 March, a new rotation of soldiers arrived and agreed the six men could be buried in the cemetery. Moving around the village was generally forbidden by the Russians, but on that day they allowed people to walk to the cemetery for the burial. A procession of villagers wrapped in white sheets made their way to the spot. There, they dug shallow graves to bury the six, while a Russian armoured personnel carrier stood guard. The newly arrived Russian soldiers seemed ashamed of the killings, but one of them claimed to Vovk that it was “Ukrainian Nazis” who had shot the men, not his own comrades. Vovk still cannot fathom why her relatives were taken in the first place. She said her son was “far from politics and weapons” and had no links to the Ukrainian army or territorial defence units. In the days after the killings, the Russians took over several buildings in the village to use as bases, and established their headquarters in the local school. A stamped and signed inventory paper lying on the floor inside the school identified its occupants as the 297th anti-aircraft missile brigade, stationed in Penza region in the Urals and equipped with Buk M-2 surface-to-air missiles. Inside the school – a recently renovated two-storey building painted lime green and sandy yellow – the destruction was almost total. The headteacher, Natalia Vovk, navigated shards of glass, ripped-up Russian ration packs and other debris as she surveyed the damage, stepping carefully as the building had not been fully checked for mines. “I don’t know how we’ll teach. The school bus is destroyed, so we can’t take the children to neighbouring villages,” she said. The school would try to arrange distance learning, but the Russians had stolen all the electronic equipment. A natural optimist, she had begun the conversation with a stoic demeanour and talk of revival, but after a few minutes she was in tears at the enormity of the destruction. The Russians not only looted the school and comprehensively trashed the interiors, their actions also suggest a mission of cultural destruction. Almost all the library books were stacked in piles against windows to form shields, sealed together with foam, thus making them unreadable. On posters of Ukrainian historical and literary luminaries around the school, the faces had been defaced. An embossed Ukrainian trident on the wall was daubed with paint. The only place to remain relatively unscathed was a small exhibition room dedicated to villagers who fought in the second world war. “Do not touch the museum,” a Russian soldier had scrawled in pen on the door. On the blackboards in the classrooms, different soldiers had left behind messages in chalk. One had drawn a bat, a symbol of GRU military intelligence. Another had written: “Slavic brothers, you are being conned!” Next to it, someone had written: “Forgive us, we did not want this war.” In another classroom, the board read “Let’s live peacefully”, a grotesque message given the carnage all around. After killing the six men on the first day, the Russians staged at least one more mass killing during their time in the village, according to Maksym Didyk, who spent 12 days tied up and blindfolded in a small outhouse across the road from the school after being grabbed at a checkpoint on 19 March and beaten by Russians who demanded information about Ukrainian positions. Sometimes, the Russian soldier in charge of guarding the prisoners there was friendly, but at other times he got drunk and became violent, Didyk recalled. Didyk said he was beaten, hit over the head with bottles and forced to sing Ukrainian folk songs at gunpoint. Eventually his captor took a shine to him and allowed him to sit upstairs in the building, not in the cellar. He was even given proper food to eat. On 30 March, the day before the Russians left, a group of them had a party not far from the outhouse where the prisoners were held, Didyk recalled. “They sat and grilled meat, and they were drinking a lot. They were packing their bags and preparing to leave and were celebrating their departure. But then their mood got worse; they said their positions had been hit,” he said. The soldier in charge of the prisoners, who never gave his name or rank, appeared and said he had been ordered to provide “four corpses”, Didyk recalled. “He said he didn’t want to do it … he had tears in his eyes … but he said it was his orders and he had to shoot four people. He asked for volunteers.” The soldier marched 10 prisoners out of the hut in pairs, walking them to the cemetery across the road. He later told Didyk he had shot four of them and allowed six to slip away, ordering them to sleep in a barn and then escape in the morning, when the Russians had departed, so that his superiors would not know he had spared them. The next morning the Russians did indeed leave the village, as part of a wholesale abandonment of their bloody, failed advance on Kyiv. Didyk and the other prisoners walked through the fog to a neighbouring village in the early hours of 31 March. When they left the hut, in a mortar crater in the cemetery Didyk saw the bodies of two of the men who had been taken the night before. At another spot in the cemetery he saw a third corpse. His father, Oleksandr, also saw the bodies the next day, and recalled that one “had his brains spilling out”. A patch of thick, congealed blood was still visible in the soil when the Guardian visited. Didyk did not know the names of the three men, saying they were not locals of Staryi or Novyi Bykiv. It is not clear what happened to the fourth man the soldier claimed to have killed. One fellow prisoner Didyk did recognise during his time in captivity was Viktoria Andrusha, a maths teacher from Brovary, outside Kyiv, who had returned to the village to be with her parents because she thought it would be safer. The Russians raided the Andrusha house on 26 March and demanded to examine the family’s phones. The soldiers said they found evidence on Andrusha’s phone that she had been passing information to Ukrainian authorities, and marched her away blindfolded. Two days later they came back to arrest Andrusha’s mother, Kateryna. Kateryna was held for three days, blindfolded and alone in a basement. At one point, one of the Russian soldiers asked her why her husband, Mykola, had problems standing, and she explained he had painful knee joints. “Do you know that not far from you there’s a laboratory where the Americans are making biological substances and injecting your people with them?” the Russian soldier asked her. Kateryna was able to walk free when the Russians left town, but nobody knows what happened to Viktoria. Nobody has seen her since the day she spent together with Didyk as a prisoner. “I am so proud of my daughter. Will they find her? I don’t know. I don’t have words any more,” said Mykola, his breaths deep sighs and his eyes crimson with sorrow. He was clutching a 10-year-old photograph from their daughter’s school days; all of the more recent pictures were stored on their phones and computers, which had been stolen by the Russians. While the Andrusha family waits in agony for news of their daughter, the relatives of the six men killed on the first day received a terrible kind of closure this week when the men’s bodies were exhumed and reburied so that authorities could issue death certificates. Examination showed one man had his throat cut and another was stabbed in the heart; the other four were shot in the head, according to locals who were present at the examination. Thursday marked the 40th day since the murders, a symbolic milestone for Orthodox believers. Hladky’s aunt, Yulia, took white cloth banners with religious inscriptions to the cemetery, to fasten to the simple iron crosses that marked the graves. Back at the family home, she had stayed strong for her sisters. Now, alone in the cemetery, she had a moment of terrible catharsis as she crumpled by the grave. Kissing the photograph of her slain nephew and running her hands along the freshly raked soil, she interspersed peals of grief with howled curses about the Russians, the invaders who had arrived so unexpectedly and brought death and destruction to her family, her village, her country. The material damage done by the month of Russian occupation in places such as Staryi Bykiv will take many months, perhaps even years, to repair. The emotional scars will take much longer to heal.",News/World news,"After Russians’ retreat, scarred Ukrainian village recounts month of terror",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/09/after-russians-retreat-scarred-ukrainian-village-recounts-month-of-terror
4/9/2022,"France’s 2022 presidential election campaign has been curiously devoid of passion and excitement – partly because for so long its outcome looked a foregone conclusion. But amid the general apathy, some revealing moments have stood out. Elected five years ago as “neither of the right nor the left”, Emmanuel Macron is seen as having veered rightward in office – and winning over disillusioned left-leaning voters will be crucial to a second term. At his one big rally of the campaign, Macron cheekily recycled not just the two successful campaign slogans of France’s first Socialist president, François Mitterrand (“A calm strength” [“La force tranquille”] and “France united”), but also a far-left, anti-capitalist battle cry first coined in 2002: “Our lives are worth more than their profits.” It didn’t go unnoticed. Marine Le Pen’s long campaign to detoxify the far-right, anti-immigration party Rassemblement National (National Rally), founded by her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen, in 1972, has also involved a sustained effort to soften her own image. In an intimate TV interview she opened up about her sometimes troubled childhood, confessed to the problems her surname had caused her – and rhapsodised at length about the six cats who share her life, revealing she has recently passed the diploma to become a registered breeder. Nobody hates a cat lover, do they? Valérie Pécresse, the rightwing Les Républicains candidate, has had a miserable campaign, representing a divided party, playing a more hardline role than she is comfortable with and suffering multiple defections by senior party figures. She wasn’t helped by the pointed lack of public backing she received from perhaps the most senior of all, Nicolas Sarkozy, who at one stage opted to support PSG at a football match rather than attend a Pécresse rally. When the former president’s name was mentioned, it was resoundingly booed. Arguably the most heated debates were a series of face-to-face confrontations between the far-left firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon and the far-right TV polemicist Éric Zemmour, bad-tempered affairs that at times descended into outright slanging matches – so much so that during one encounter Zemmour complained he was being unfairly bullied. “You didn’t seriously come on here, opposite me, and expect to be stroked?” responded the famously belligerent leader of La France Insoumise (Unbowed France). The exchange went viral, not least for the double entendre. The clash between the fanatically anti-immigration Zemmour and one of France’s great sporting heroes was only ever going to end one way. The extreme-right candidate was sent off when he turned up for a kickabout at a five-a-side football club in Aix-en-Provence founded by the football legend and former France captain Zinedine Zidane, the son of Algerian immigrants, and run by his brother. “Get them out of here. All of them,” Noureddine Zidane said, minutes after Zemmour – whose campaign had booked the venue, but not revealed who it was for – arrived with cameras in tow.

4/9/2022,"George Whatley is probably Britain’s most successful anti-oil campaigner, but you won’t find him at Extinction Rebellion’s latest wave of protests or the Just Stop Oil campaign which has blocked fossil fuel infrastructure recently. At 80 years old and after a recent spell in hospital, he will be taking it easy at his bungalow on Canvey Island, Essex. But if anyone can claim a place in the annals of successful environmental protests, it is this former Bank of England security guard. In the space of 50 years, Whatley has on five occasions taken on oil and gas companies trying to expand refineries and import terminals and sent them packing. “What have I learned? The big boys don’t win all the time,” he says. “If you believe to your soul that what is happening is wrong, you have to stand and be counted. “Ultimately it’s a media war. You use the publicity to the advantage of the people. You attack the corporate image of the companies, the MPs and the councillors. And you use every stunt you can think of: armadas on the river, occupying offices, carrying white crosses – but never violence.” The latest victory is postponement of plans by an oil storage business to double the size of its already huge depot at Canvey. The operator Oikos Storage joins a roster of names such as Occidental Petroleum, United Refineries (part of Eni in Italy), Calor Gas and British Gas who have run into Whatley and his determined band of Canvey campaigners. In 1973, Whatley and three neighbours sat in his kitchen on Limburg Road and decided to stand up against two separate plans to build massive new oil refineries on the banks of the Thames. “It was always going to be a David and Goliath fight and, to be honest, we never thought we could possibly win. “We just thought: why should these big corporations just barge their way into our back gardens and do what they want?” The wider area was already the biggest petrochemical complex in Europe and Whatley claims that if Occidental and Eni were successful 800 of Canvey’s 1,700 hectares (4,200 acres) of land would have been taken up by potentially dangerous infrastructure. What became the Canvey Island Oil Refinery Resistance group battled for 14 years before success finally came and the oil companies scrapped their plans, blaming low product prices. In the meantime the protests were intensified by local concerns after the Provisional IRA exploded a bomb in 1979 at a Texaco petroleum storage tank on the island. Whatley and his protesters – often made up of local mothers and their children in prams – blocked Canvey roads, and invaded the offices of Eni and Occidental in London. They locked the local politicians in the Canvey council chamber and took an armada of boats up from Canvey to the Houses of Parliament. Whatley even met the then prime minister, Harold Wilson, as ministers desperately and unsuccessfully tried to halt their campaign. The same determination was shown in south Essex in 2007 when Calor Gas, alongside Centrica (the owner of British Gas) and Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, tried to push through a plan to build a liquefied natural gas import facility. The People Against Methane Group, with Whatley at the helm, stopped that. In the 2010s a project to bring biodiesel to Canvey was defeated too. Oikos Storage is now getting the Whatley treatment after unveiling plans to increase petroleum storage from 290,000 cubic metres capacity to 600,000. The company, owned by SL Capital Infrastructure, also wants to install a deep-water jetty where larger tankers can unload fuel. Oikos says it wants to expand “to ensure that the best use is made of an essential part of the UK’s fuelling needs in respect of its contribution to the security and resilience of the UK’s fuel supply and distribution system”. A spokesperson confirmed its planning application, which was to have been submitted early this year, had been postponed but denied the whole project had been dropped. On this occasion, local councillors have said they would oppose the scheme, which was expected to go for approval to the secretary of state for transport, as it had been deemed a “nationally significant infrastructure project”. Another active member of the original Canvey refinery resistance group watching Oikos with concern is the musician Wilko Johnson, who lives in nearby Southend. The Canvey-born former Dr Feelgood guitarist says he has mixed feelings about oil and its superstructures. “My sympathies are with environmentalists, absolutely, absolutely. I’m 74 and a fucking old geezer so my protest days are over but to tell you the truth, I was in love with Shell Haven and those [other now dismantled] refineries: the towers, the flames, the magic. It was Babylon.”",News/Environment,‘It’s a media war’: the UK’s top anti-oil campaigner fights on aged 80,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/09/george-whatley-canvey-island-anti-oil-campaigner-aged-80
4/9/2022,"Of the many things to be worked out were Scotland to become independent, the national anthem is low down on the list. The Corries’ 1960s folk song Flower of Scotland, which has been sung at football and rugby matches for decades, has everything a decent anthem needs. From its defiant tale of triumph over the auld enemy at Bannockburn (“And sent him homeward / Tae think again”) to its eulogy for absent heroism (“Autumn leaves lie thick and still / O’er land that is lost now”), it is imbued with what the Australian poet and literary critic Christopher Kelen calls “anthem quality”. This, Kelen argues, is the ability of a song to raise a special type of goosebump – not only through the feelings that words and tune stir in the individual singer, but also “the knowledge that these feelings are shared by one’s compatriots”. Yet Flower of Scotland elicits a murmur of embarrassment in some circles, even among nationalists – indeed, this goes all the way to the top. In a recent interview on The Cultural Coven podcast, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about a hypothetical new anthem for an independent Scotland. “Nothing beats belting out Flower of Scotland at Hampden or Murrayfield,” the first minister said, but she confessed that: “The words are not the most uplifting and forward-looking.” She offered two alternatives: Highland Cathedral – a popular bagpipe tune that haunts Edinburgh’s tourist traps – and Dougie MacLean’s 1977 song Caledonia, a homesick lament best known for its starring role in an early-1990s advert for Tennent’s lager. In some ways, these would both be fitting anthems for modern-day Scotland, reflecting the Scottish government’s obsession with attracting foreign investment and tourists while domestic industries and public services crumble. But fortunately for those leftwingers who blanch at Flower of Scotland’s anti-Englishness, there are several better options. One is Both Sides the Tweed, a moving protest song about the 1707 Acts of Union, which says: “Let friendship and honour unite / And flourish on both sides the Tweed.” Then there is Scotland Will Flourish, another Corries number (and a favourite of Alex Salmond), which celebrates “the strength of our labour” and commands us to: “Forget the old battles, those days are over / Hatred corrupts and friendship refines.” The obvious radical option, however, is Hamish Henderson’s Freedom Come-All-Ye, written in Scots in 1960 and adopted as an anthem by the anti-nuclear movement. It commemorates the revolutionary communist John Maclean and condemns Scotland’s role in the British empire: “Broken faimlies [families] in lands we’ve herriet [harried] / Will curse Scotland the Brave nae mair, nae mair…” These are all worthy candidates, possessing that spine-tingling quality that Kelen identifies while rejecting the uncomfortable conflation of national pride with ethnic strife. But I must confess to another kind of discomfort at the prospect of a more ideologically correct national anthem. It seems to reflect an implicit yearning among Scotland’s progressives to feel more comfortable with their long-running dalliance with nationalism – a kind of national virtue-signalling that has always been one of Scotland’s favourite pastimes, dressing up our institutions and actions in the right words while rarely altering their substance. I actually think Flower of Scotland deserves a second chance. Not because I harbour an ancient grudge against England, but precisely because it unsettles those who don’t. Its very ominousness strains at the limits of Scotland’s progressive self-satisfaction, reminding us that nationalism is, as the Scottish writer Tom Nairn put it, always “morally, politically, humanly ambiguous”. Singing your national anthem ought to make you feel a little uneasy, even – especially – when it gives you goosebumps. Does any of this really matter? It’s just a song, after all, and there are far bigger problems facing the country. Yet there is something remarkable about national anthems. In a world of endlessly proliferating cultural options, selected and presented for us by markets and algorithms, it is increasingly bizarre that we should all know the words and the tune to the same old song. I also think the idea of a national debate over whether or not we collectively approve of a song about ourselves has something rather utopian about it. Trotksy once predicted that under communism, with the great social struggles resolved, “people will divide into ‘parties’ over the question of … competing tendencies in music,” among other things (“a new gigantic canal”, the “best system of sports”). In lieu of a revolution, a proper anthem debate could at least provoke more illuminating popular reflections on Scotland’s identity and culture than salty bickering over pensions and currency. Perhaps, in this spirit, the illusory timelessness of national anthems could be undermined in an independent Scotland by a forced renewal every 10 years or so, giving the various aesthetic “parties” time to build and evangelise their case: buskers instead of canvassers, concerts instead of conferences, mixtapes instead of manifestos. With national culture thus democratised, I know what I’d campaign for to replace Flower of Scotland. John McEvoy’s 1950s folk song The Wee Magic Stane is a spiky, comedic tribute to when four Scottish nationalist students stole the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey. It features a raucous chorus of “too-ra-li-oo-ra-li-oo-ra-li-ay” and a mischievous impression of the Dean of Westminster’s plummy accent. Most importantly, it ends with a genuinely profound satire of sovereignty and national myths. In its telling, the UK government, seeking to replace the missing lump of rock on which Scottish kings were once crowned, commissions a stonemason to produce a new one, but “ … the bloke that wis turnin’ them aff on the belt / At the peak o’ production was so sorely pressed / That the real yin got bunged in alang wi’ the rest.” Essentially, the Stone of Destiny gets mixed up with lots of replicas, so anybody can crown themselves king. It is a fitting republican anthem for an age of blockchains and bought-off governments, reminding us that there can be liberation and joy in disenchantment.
