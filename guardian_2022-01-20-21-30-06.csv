1/20/2022,"Top US diplomat Antony Blinken will seek to clarify any confusion left by Joe Biden’s suggestion that a minor incursion by Russia into Ukraine might not be met by an allied response in a major set-piece speech in Berlin. Blinken will assert that the sovereignty of Ukraine is a sacrosanct global principle that must be protected, while also seeking to address the Russian people directly by saying the US is not seeking to imperil the security that Russian people deserve. Blinken is in Berlin to shore up western unity amid signs of a Russian troop build-up on Ukraine’s borders.  At a press conference on Wednesday, Biden admitted there were divisions between allies and implied a minor incursion into Ukraine might be met by a lesser response. Later the White House clarified his remarks to say he was drawing a distinction between a Russian physical land invasion over the Ukrainian border or other actions from the Russian playbook such as a cyber-attack. Biden’s initial remarks drew ire from the Republicans, who claimed he had green-lighted an invasion. They also caused concern in Ukraine, but after the White House mopping up operation Ukraine seemed to have been reassured. Blinken is due to meet his Russian opposite number Sergey Lavrov in Geneva on Friday, but he has said he is not bringing written proposals in response to Russian demands for a legally binding agreement that neither Ukraine or Moldova will ever join Nato. Biden on Wednesday said he did not think Ukraine would qualify for membership soon. Russia wants a US commitment to Ukraine’s permanent exclusion Blinken will instead set out the issues on which the US is prepared to negotiate with Russia, covering stationing of intermediate missiles, transparency of military exercises and cyber-attacks. Nato is due to make a formal offer to Russia this week. Biden warned of possible disastrous consequences for Russia if an invasion went ahead, adding he expected one now to occur. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen also sought to shore up transatlantic unity, talking of a robust EU response in the event of further attacks against Ukraine. “If the situation deteriorates, if there are any further attacks on the territorial integrity of Ukraine, we will respond with massive economic and financial sanctions. The transatlantic community stands firm in this,” von der Leyen said during the opening of the World Economic Forum. “We do not accept Russia’s attempt to divide Europe into spheres of influence,” she said. “If attacks happen, we are prepared.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov hit back at Biden, saying his remarks would not help reduce soaring tensions over Ukraine and could even destabilise the situation further.Asked about Biden’s comments, Peskov said Russia had been receiving similar warnings for at least a month. “We believe that they in no way contribute to defusing the tension that has now arisen in Europe and, moreover, can contribute to the destabilisation of the situation,” he said. Despite repeated recent statements from Kyiv to the contrary, Peskov also said Moscow feared the sanctions threats by the United States might embolden Kyiv to try to resolve an eight-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine by force.The Kremlin spokesman declined to comment on a parliamentary proposal by a group of lawmakers to appeal to President Vladimir Putin to recognise two pro-Russian breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine as independent states. The proposal has long been under discussion in Russia but Peskov said it was a lawmakers’ initiative that still needed to be voted on and that he therefore could not comment In Ukraine, Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, said Ukraine welcomed the fact that Biden had signalled that there would be a coordinated western response in the event of Russia making a move on Ukraine. He said the important point was that “western states have a common understanding that any negative scenario in relation to Ukraine or in general in Europe will receive a coordinated, sufficient and sensitive response”. “At the same time, it is important to understand that diplomatic efforts at various levels continue, and de-escalation steps are now the main goal of these efforts.” Romanian president, Klaus Iohannis, on Thursday welcomed French counterpart Emmanuel Macron’s announcement of a possible troop deployment on Nato’s eastern flank. On Wednesday, Macron expressed France’s “readiness to go further, and within the framework of Nato to commit to new missions ... in particular in Romania”. “I warmly welcome President Emmanuel Macron’s announcement on France’s readiness to participate in Nato’s forward military presence in Romania,” Iohannis tweeted.",News/US news,Blinken to reassert Ukraine sovereignty in Berlin speech,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/antony-blinken-us-ukraine-russia-berlin-speech

1/20/2022,"West Ham need a back-up striker for Michail Antonio and David Moyes has identified Blackburn’s Ben Brereton Díaz as a potential target. That’s all well and good, but considering the Stoke-born Chilean superstar has already chipped in with 20 goals to help Blackburn’s promotion push this season, Blackburn are extremely unlikely to let him leave Ewood Park any time soon. Leeds, Brighton and Sevilla are also interested in Brereton Díaz, whose current employers value their man at £25m. Moyes is also interested in Nat Phillips, who has made just three appearances for Liverpool this season and will be allowed to leave in the current window. Watford have also enquired about the £15m-rated central defender, while Liverpool are about to recall Rhys Williams from a loan spell at Swansea in order to provide cover for a player sick of providing cover.  Home from the Africa Cup of Nations after testing positive for Covid and now sidelined as he recovers from “cardiac lesions”, Arsenal’s out-of-favour former captain Pierre Emerick-Aubameyang could be off to Saudi club Al-Nassr on a six-month loan deal. You can read more on that story and Manchester United’s rejection of a potential loan deal for Jesse Lingard from Newcastle by clicking on this link. Lille striker Jonathan David is a man in big demand, with Chelsea, Spurs, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool all believed to be keen on the 22-year-old Canadian international, who has scored 22 goals for club and country this season. Arguably the most public face of Barcelona’s reckless spending in the transfer market, Newcastle and Tottenham target Ousmane Dembélé has been ordered to defecate or get off the pot by his increasingly impatient manager, Xavi Hernandez. Signed from Borussia Dortmund in 2017 for a fee of £105m and rising, the French striker has just six months left on his contract but is refusing to sign a new deal, in a state of affairs that has got the antennae of a host of different European clubs twitching. “It is a difficult situation with Dembélé,” said Xavi. “The club have decided that if he does not renew, we have to look for a solution because they have been waiting too long. It has been five months that [sporting director, Mateu Alemany] has been speaking with the agents. Either he renews, or we look for a solution. The message is clear: either Dembélé renews or we look for an exit for the player – there is nothing else left for it. I don’t consider sending him to the stands. He says he wants to stay but then he does not sign. It is a shame.” Alemany has since suggested things are done with the Frenchman. In big-name managerial merry-go-round news, Zinedine Zidane is being tipped to take over at Paris Saint-Germain this summer, which could pave the way for Mauricio Pochettino to take over at Manchester United.

1/20/2022,"A 33-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of the murder of an 86-year-old woman and the attempted murder of her 88-year-old husband, who was left with life-threatening injuries after they were attacked in their home. Freda Walker was found dead at the couple’s home in Langwith Junction, Derbyshire, on Saturday morning by a neighbour. Walker’s husband, Ken, a former district councillor, remains in hospital in a critical condition.  Detectives had been trawling CCTV and conducting house-to-house inquiries to find those responsible, Derbyshire police said. The arrested man remains in police custody. Assistant chief constable Dave Kirby said: “Today’s arrest is clearly a significant breakthrough in the case but the investigation continues into this most appalling crime.” Police said a “serious level of violence” was used in the attack, and are considering whether more than one person was responsible. A leading line of inquiry is to establish whether the incident could have been an aggravated burglary. Investigators are appealing for anyone who was on Station Road between 4.30pm on Friday 14 January and 9am on Saturday 15 January to urgently come forward. “If you were on that street, either on foot or in a car, then please contact us as soon as possible,” Kirby said. Ken, who is a member of Shirebrook town council and was previously a councillor on Bolsover district council, is in a critical but stable condition in hospital, police said earlier in the week. The Bolsover district council leader, Steve Fritchley, said the attack had sent shockwaves through the community: “Ken retired from being a district councillor in 2019 and just when they should both be enjoying their twilight years together, this terrible incident has happened and our thoughts are with Ken and his family,” he said. “We have heard many people say ‘Oh Ken and Freda, what a lovely couple’, and they really were.” Anyone who may be able to help detectives with their inquiries is asked to contact Derbyshire police.",News/UK news,Man held on suspicion of murder after Derbyshire couple attacked in home,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/20/man-held-on-suspicion-of-after-derbyshire-couple-attacked-in-home-freda-walker
1/20/2022,"The documentary-maker John Pett, who has died aged 94, contributed three powerful episodes to ITV’s epic series The World at War. His style fitted perfectly with the aim of giving viewers an insight into how conflict felt for those immersed in it. The massive project, three years in the making and screened in 26 episodes over 1973 and 1974, was the brainchild of Jeremy Isaacs, the series’ overall producer at Thames Television. He was intent on combining newsreel images of the second world war with eyewitness testimony from all sides. Alongside its thematic structure and authoritative accounts from the different theatres of war, Laurence Olivier’s narration gave the programmes further gravitas, and Carl Davis’s dark but majestic title music conveyed the looming horrors to come.  Pett was working for Thames Television when he heard about plans for the groundbreaking series and told Isaacs he would like to be involved. “Were you in the war?” asked Isaacs. “No, because I did my national service about 1947, but my brother was in Burma,” Pett replied. Isaacs immediately assigned him to produce and direct the episode about the Japanese defeat of the British there, It’s a Lovely Day Tomorrow, which picked up the story halfway through the war and had a title taken from a Vera Lynn song. Those strains accompanied footage of the “forgotten army” in Burma, following film of the singer’s wartime visit to them. Pett said the challenge was “to make both strategical and emotional sense in just one hour of viewing”. The result showed soldiers trekking through monsoon rains and thick mud, and hacking off tree branches to create a path in the jungle, “a steam bath closing out the sky, dense, imprisoning and a long way from home”, in the words of John Williams’s script. A former British army sergeant recalled it as “really scary” while a Japanese officer described it as “a friendly place, dark, where you could cover yourself and camouflage yourself”. Pett included similar firsthand insights in Morning, the episode about D-day – the long preparations, then “hours of death, fear, courage, of plans gone wrong, of rapid improvisation” – and Pacific, on the Americans driving back the Japanese from Tarawa, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Such events in the big, wide world were a long way from the small north Devon village of Shebbear, where Pett was born. He was the son of Hilda (nee Larkworthy), who acted and sang in local productions, and George Pett, a farm labourer suffering the effects of shell shock and mustard gas from the first world war. Pett credited some of their peasant ancestors – “closet socialists and radicals” – with passing on to them, and him, a “need to dissent”. More than half a century later he would return to make a Channel 4 drama-documentary, Going Home: Shebbear (1983), recreating a year of his 1930s childhood, when his parents endured poverty that was eased only after they moved 50 miles away to Cheriton Bishop, where they ran a sub-post office together. Pett absorbed literature, music and radio, and attended Chagford school and two London technical schools that were evacuated during wartime: Borough Polytechnic, in Exeter, then Beaufoy Technical Institute in Budleigh Salterton. Although he failed his first-year civil engineering exams at the University College of the South West of England, in Exeter (later the University of Exeter), acting in plays there convinced him that his career lay on the stage. After army service (1945-48) with the Intelligence Corps as a field security sergeant, then the Educational Corps, Pett became an actor and assistant stage manager at Salisbury Arts theatre. A year at the Old Vic school in London (1948-49) was followed by touring with the West of England theatre company (1949-50) and more repertory experience. There were also appearances in a couple of BBC radio plays (1953-54) and a bit part as a wireless operator in the 1955 film Out of the Clouds. After a brief stint as a reporter and drama and film critic on the Croydon Advertiser, Pett got his break in 1961 when ITV’s newly launched Plymouth-based company, Westward Television, hired him to present its film programme, Stars in the West. He then anchored its news magazine and started making documentaries, regionally and for the network, then for the BBC and, later, Channel 4. After presenting The Price of a Record (1967), about the ambition that drove Donald Campbell until his death while attempting the world water speed record, he was a prolific director of single documentaries such as The Silent Valley (1971), about the demise of mining leaving a Cornish community devastated (a silver medal winner at the New York international film and television festival); Moonlight Sonata (1980), on the German bombing of Coventry; and The Story of English (1986), charting how Shakespeare’s language was taken to the New World. After making So Many Children (1966), about a group born with disabilities, he caught up with five of them over the next 20 years in Children No More (1976) as they went through adolescence and One in a Hundred (1986) to see how they were coping with adulthood. He also wrote and produced The Privileged (1968), a series about the expansion of universities and increase in students, and directed an Omnibus documentary on the cartoonist Ronald Searle (1975), and an Assignment programme, Secrets of the General, on the complicity between the former Paraguayan dictator Alfredo Stroessner and western governments (1993). He also taught at the Northern Media School, Sheffield, and Winchester University until retiring at the age of 85. In 1955 he married Greta Whiteley, and they had two children; they later divorced. In 1984 he married Victoria Goss. She and their daughters, Alexandra and Philippa, survive him, along with Vanessa and Jonathan, the children of his first marriage.

1/20/2022,"Dafoe wasn’t natural casting as the clerkly TS Eliot in this literary biopic, which chronicled the poet’s troubled first marriage – and it showed, despite his customary actorly intelligence. If nothing else, it proved that, his highbrow credentials notwithstanding, Dafoe wasn’t really cut out for the anglophile heritage pics that littered the 1990s.  A technically precise but essentially unrewarding role in the Alan Parker civil rights pic. Dafoe plays a straight-arrow fed investigating the disappearing of vote-drive volunteers in the Klan-haunted 60s deep south alongside co-star Gene Hackman, who has much the showier role. Leading with razor-sharp side parting and horn-rimmed specs, it’s one of a long succession of cops and authority figures that has paid Dafoe’s rent over the years. An inspired bit of voice casting that gave Dafoe his biggest box office result to date. He played Gill, the “tank gang” leader who teaches Nemo self-reliance and – crucially – comes up with the schemes to get the fish out of the dentist’s waiting room. Surreal in itself to hear Dafoe’s gravelly tones in a Disney picture. Dafoe was an early-ish adopter of the new wave of comic-book pics; he wasn’t the first choice for the Green Goblin supervillain role, but it turned out a smart move on director Sam Raimi’s part, with Dafoe’s ability to project both complete sincerity and terrifying menace brought to bear – especially in the now celebrated mirror scene, where the two halves of his personality argue with each other. Dafoe’s first lead role was for a fresh-from-film-school Kathryn Bigelow, co-directing with future Wild at Heart producer Monty Montgomery. A slice of early-80s 50s-revival chic, Dafoe is the super-hunky leader of a Wild Angels-ish outlaw biker gang. Presumably prioritising his work with avant-garde performance outfit the Wooster Group, Dafoe isn’t really relaxed in front of the camera – but he looks amazing, like Audie Murphy’s crackhead cousin. Dafoe doesn’t have a whole lot to do until the last 20 minutes of Walter Hill’s DayGlo rock’n’roll musical, and his twitchy greaser supervillain Raven is basically a nastier version of The Loveless’ Vance. But he makes the most of the climactic fight scene, giving it maximum voltage as he pummels Michael Paré with a platelayer’s hammer. Paul Schrader has given Dafoe a good number of top-notch supporting roles, and this one, as the alleged murderer of sleazeball TV actor Bob Crane, is one of the most interestingly modulated. As video whiz John Carpenter, Dafoe moves from ingratiating manipulator to desperate killer with impressive conviction. Dafoe proved he could carry a mainstream picture with this entertainingly twisty and atmospheric cop thriller directed by Roger Donaldson. Dafoe plays a smalltown lawman who enthusiastically stumbles into a high-stakes espionage kill-off; the patsy-type role doesn’t exactly play to his strengths, but he’s the movie’s solid centre. This was supposed to be Dafoe’s big breakthrough to leading-man status – as ever, he gives it his all, successfully conveying the deadly seriousness of director Martin Scorsese’s intent. But it didn’t really happen for him: Dafoe’s self-lacerating contribution was overshadowed by the wider furore, as the film was engulfed in protests, threats and bans. Dafoe had a huge mainstream hit with Oliver Stone’s vision of the Vietnam war as a lawless charnel house. His role, memorably encapsulated in the film’s Christ-like poster image, is the film’s moral conscience, the good angel in Charlie Sheen’s ear. But, as we know, he is cut down by Tom Berenger’s brutal Sgt Barnes and then finished off in slo-mo by the Viet Cong. Dafoe is in David Lynch’s Palme d’Or winner for less than half an hour, but what an impact he makes. As sneering triggerman Bobby Peru, equipped with pencil moustache and prosthetic additions to his already-prominent choppers, Dafoe achieved his most alarming grotesque yet. The scene where he terrorises Laura Dern’s Lula is still genuinely upsetting. Dafoe got a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his role in this enterprising take on the making of the influential silent film Nosferatu. Under the layers of makeup and bald cap, Dafoe does an excellent job of making his Schreck/Orlok vampire-actor seem eminently plausible. In retrospect, the high point of Dafoe’s mainstream pomp. As the vicious counterfeiter Rick Masters, Dafoe makes for a properly scary Hollywood bad guy, opposite William Petersen’s 501s-wearing secret service agent Richard Chance. With Masters’ background as an artist, it’s a role that could cleverly take advantage of Dafoe’s never-buried-far sensitive side. In Abel Ferrara, Dafoe has found a partner willing to give him free rein to explore his out-there preoccupations – as well as being one of the few directors to give him serious leading roles. These two films, unofficial companion pieces, are arguably Ferrara’s most personal, and show Dafoe at his best: articulate, committed and unfazed by even the weirdest dramatic situations. Dafoe has had to range widely in search of suitably heavyweight roles, and this one took him all the way to Tasmania. As a freelance secret operative assigned to hunt down the supposedly extinct Tasmanian tiger, he could deploy the tricky actor’s craft of just doing things methodically, on his own for long periods. There’s a moral crisis thrown in, too, at which Dafoe is a past master. Dafoe got another supporting actor Oscar nomination for this fatherly role, in which he radiates concern and exasperation in equal measure as a Disney World-adjacent motel manager. The main focus of his anxiety are mother-and-daughter pair Halley and Moonee (Bria Vinaite and Brooklynn Prince); they, in truth, are the film’s stars, but Dafoe is the ballast. Whether or not you buy into the sincerity of arch provocateur Lars von Trier’s occult horror (and the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw certainly didn’t), there’s no doubting the total commitment of Dafoe and Charlotte Gainsbourg, the two main players in this dance of trauma, sex and death. Dafoe is a therapist attempting to treat his grief-consumed wife after their toddler son falls to his death; his super-earnest articulacy is infused with an unfamiliar note of superciliousness – though it’s of course abandoned by the time of the film’s nightmarish climactic confrontation. With his seamed and blocky visage, Dafoe was perfect casting for Vincent van Gogh in Julian Schnabel’s treatment of the painter’s turbulent final months, and the film is very much a communion from one artist to another. The director focuses on Van Gogh’s act of looking, and as the possessor of Hollywood’s most piercing stare, Dafoe carries it off beautifully, as well as convincingly handling the more troubling later episodes. Many have tried to portray artistic rapture on screen without looking like an idiot; Dafoe is one of the vanishingly few who have pulled it off. There is something about being matched with a gifted co-star (see Antichrist) that brings out the best in Dafoe, and this two-hander with Robert Pattinson has the added sense of the passing of a baton to a new generation. As the elder and crustier of a pair of men looking after a lighthouse in the late 19th century, Dafoe handles some ripely ornate dialogue with aplomb in a battle of wits and authority with the sulky Pattinson. And like Lars von Trier, director Robert Eggers goes full eco-freaky and puts Dafoe through the wringer physically; the actor’s battered body stands up well. In the early 90s, before the juicy supporting roles and eye-catching cameos began piling up, Dafoe looked as if he had a long stint as a leading man in front of him, the sort of career Johnny Depp or Robert Downey Jr have had. Looking back, it’s clear that Dafoe was a shade too uncompromising to connect with audiences in the same way. But this now-unfashionable Paul Schrader film gave Dafoe a near-perfect role: a drug courier with an emotional investment in his clients, lovelorn over his ex-wife, and the unwitting focus of the romantic attentions of his supplier (played by Susan Sarandon). Light Sleeper allowed him to convey all the subtleties that make him a great actor: conviction, honesty, self-doubt and weakness. One of the great performances, well worth revisiting.",Arts/Film,Willem Dafoe’s 20 best films – ranked!,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/20/willem-dafoe-20-best-films-ranked
1/20/2022,"One of the most successful British pop stars of the past three decades is putting up for auction works by one of the world’s most celebrated contemporary artists. Robbie Williams, who has built a huge fortune from record sales and concerts, is selling three works by Banksy, the anonymous street artist whose partially shredded painting Love is in the Bin fetched a record £18.5m last year.  The pieces from Williams’s art collection – Kissing Coppers, Girl with Balloon and Vandalised Oils (Choppers) – are expected to sell for a total of between £7m and £10m. “These works unite the cultural legacies of two of Britain’s biggest stars: Robbie Williams and Banksy,” said Hugo Cobb of Sotheby’s. “Like their creator and like their owner, they are acerbic, iconic, irreverent and unique.” Kissing Coppers, which depicts two male British police officers in a passionate embrace, first appeared on the outside wall of the Prince Albert pub in Brighton in 2004. The original mural was removed in 2014 after being repeatedly vandalised. It has been interpreted as showing Banksy’s support for public acceptance of homosexuality, according to Sotheby’s. Williams’s version of the artwork is a painting on canvas from 2005, estimated to be worth £2.5m to £3.5m. Girl with Balloon made its debut under Waterloo Bridge in London in 2002. In 2018, a canvas version of the image passed through a shredder inserted into its frame moments after it sold for just over £1m. The work’s “self-destruction” was a global sensation. Williams’s version from 2006 is depicted on metal, and is the first of its kind to appear at auction. It has a price estimate of £2m to £3m. Vandalised Oils (Choppers), from 2005, features two military helicopters disrupting a serene pastoral landscape. It is part of a Banksy series that superimposes graffiti on classical oil paintings, and has an estimate of £2.5m to £3.5m. Williams said he believed his three Banksys were “some of his best paintings and I love how closely linked they are to the street pieces”. He added: “As a collector of Banksy’s work, you become part of a broader cultural movement.” The three works will go on display at Sotheby’s New York on Saturday for six days. They will then be available to view in Hong Kong and London before being sold on 2 March. A work by Banksy, whose real name has never been confirmed, that appeared on the wall of an electrical shop in Lowestoft, Suffolk, in August has been privately sold, it was reported this week.

1/20/2022,"The City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra wasted no time in lining up a successor to Mirga Gražinytė-Tyla. Last autumn it revealed that Kazuki Yamada would take over as chief conductor from April 2023, and in his first appearance at Symphony Hall since the announcement, the warmth of the reception from both the orchestra and the rather meagre audience suggested that he is already set to be a favourite there. From the alert playing that Yamada drew from the players it was clear, too, that they respond well to his ideas. The performances of Strauss’s symphonic poem Don Juan and Mahler’s Fourth Symphony were unfailingly spirited, even brash at times – the Strauss especially – but there was real panache about both of them. Yamada certainly doesn’t hold back at the big moments; some of the fortissimos tested even Symphony Hall’s exceptional acoustic, though at the other extreme, there was an absence of genuinely quiet playing.  There was a touch of schmaltz about the Mahler, which was accentuated by Yamada’s fondness for signalling transitions with diminuendos and sometimes rather exaggerated rubato, while the undercurrent of darkness that runs through the symphony was mostly unexplored. It was left to the soprano soloist in the finale, Fatma Said, to undercut the innocence of the Wunderhorn text with something more menacing. Between the Strauss and the Mahler, it was Said who provided the evening’s most memorable moments in two late Mozart arias. Vado, ma Dove?, K583, written as an addition to an opera by Martín y Soler, showed off the Egyptian singer’s fabulously light, easy coloratura, while the central section of Non Più di Fiori, one of Vitellia’s numbers from La Clemenza di Tito, revealed a thrilling smoky darkness to her chest register, with the CBSO’s principal clarinet, Oliver Janes, providing the supple clarinet obligato.

1/20/2022,"Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, will travel to Brussels on Monday with a target of agreeing a deal with the EU on the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland by the end of February. The two sides have agreed that a window of opportunity for an agreement will close when campaigning starts for May’s elections to the Northern Ireland assembly.  Maroš Šefčovič, the EU’s Brexit commissioner, who will host Truss in Brussels on Monday, told MEPs in a private briefing there had been a positive tone to his discussions with the foreign secretary at her official country residence last week. Truss took over responsibility for Brexit issues after David Frost’s resignation in January. But for all that Truss had expressed confidence she would be able to build momentum in favour of a deal, Šefčovič said there was as yet no sign of a change in the UK’s negotiating positions. Sources said the commissioner had been “surprised and concerned” that Truss had regurgitated Frost’s demands for a dispute system similar to that within the trade deal, the complete removal of checks on goods from Great Britain destined for Northern Ireland, and a rethink on the current system of EU approval of subsidies, known in Brussels as state aid. Šefčovič had reiterated that the thorough overhaul of the current protocol, which keeps Northern Ireland in the single market for goods and draws a customs border down the Irish sea, was not possible. He told MEPs the EU had also shown it could speed up its approval system for state-aid notifications. Despite these concerns, intensive talks have been continuing this week between the two sides, with concerns the protocol could become a political talking point in the Northern Ireland assembly elections. Šefčovič told MEPs it was unclear how the current scandal over lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street and a potential leadership election could affect the negotiation. He said progress would depend on whether Truss wished to cause a breakdown for political purposes or build on her reputation as a “deal-maker” after her time as trade secretary. There was, Šefčovič said, growing support in Northern Ireland for the protocol. The EU has proposed reducing health and safety checks on meat, plant and dairy products by half and customs checks by 80% but Brussels is willing to go further by ensuring that other paperwork could be done via electronic communications to reduce red tape. A big complaint within the unionist community is that the protocol has hindered trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party, has threatened to withdraw his party’s ministers from the Stormont executive if the UK government does not swiftly negotiate new arrangements with the EU. The latest numbers from Northern Ireland’s Central Statistics Office show that the value of goods imported from Great Britain fell by almost £2.75bn from January to November last year. Šefčovič said the UK was yet to accept the logic of the EU proposals but that the level of access to British IT databases was improving. He told MEPs he did not expect the UK to trigger article 16, the clause that would see parts of the current arrangements in Northern Ireland suspended.",News/Politics,Liz Truss aims to agree NI protocol deal with EU by end of February,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/liz-truss-aims-to-agree-ni-protocol-deal-with-eu-by-end-of-february

1/20/2022,"A huge coral reef has been discovered off the coast of Tahiti in the Pacific Ocean’s “twilight zone”, offering hope that more pristine ecosystems are waiting to be discovered at unexplored depths. Stretching along the ocean floor for nearly 2 miles, the reef, covered in rose-shaped corals, is one of the largest such discoveries at depths of more than 30 metres, where sunlight levels are much lower.  Scientists for the Unesco-led mission in French Polynesia said the reef, discovered in November, did not appear to have suffered bleaching events that had damaged neighbouring reefs in shallower waters in 2019. During dives totalling 200 hours, researchers were able to witness the coral spawning, with some spanning 2 metres. “It was magical to witness giant, beautiful rose corals which stretch for as far as the eye can see,” said Alexis Rosenfeld, a French underwater photographer who was part of the team of international divers that made the discovery. “It was like a work of art.” Researchers said more reefs were likely waiting to be discovered at these depths following improvements in diving technology, which had previously inhibited exploration. “To date, we know the surface of the moon better than the deep ocean. Only 20% of the entire seabed has been mapped,” said Audrey Azoulay, Unesco’s director general. Most of the world’s known coral reefs are at depths of 25 metres and above, with many facing the risk of collapse as the world’s oceans continue to heat. In September, a study found coral reef coverage had fallen by half since the 1950s because of global heating, overfishing, pollution and habitat destruction. Speaking to the BBC Prof Murray Roberts, a marine scientist at the University of Edinburgh, said the discovery underscored the need to map similar reefs to make sure they can be protected in the future. “We still associate corals with the shallowest tropical seas but here we find a huge previously unknown coral reef system. “As shallow waters warm faster than the deeper waters we may find these deeper reef systems are refuges for corals in the future. We need to get out there to map these special places,” he said. Further dives are planned in the coming months off the coast of Tahiti to continue investigations around the reef.

1/20/2022,"Ikeep waiting and hoping for the story to land. Written with burning intent by Paul Anthony Morris (artistic director of Crying in the Wilderness, associate company of the Young Vic), Conundrum is about a man, Fidel, experiencing a full-blown existential crisis. There are references to the impact of systemic racism and one specific mention of lockdown but, otherwise, few concrete details. There is pain. Frustration. Sorrow. But despite a committed and multi-dimensional performance from Anthony Ofoegbu, this feels closer to a dramatic experiment than a fully alive dramatic experience.  The action unfolds on a largely empty stage, which is full of scrawled words; snatches of memories, moments and dialogue from Fidel’s life. Around the stage is a white line that glows brightly when Fidel feels particularly upset. It’s a simple but effective set from Sean Cavanagh, which suggests a life full of restless reflection – but one that is somehow static and claustrophobic too. Key phrases, alluding to fighting against the system, bubble up frequently (“I must be 10 times smarter”). There are snippets of philosophising and atmospheric scenes set in a psychiatric ward, which seem to be alluding to a troubling accusation – which Fidel mentions briefly – that perceiving racism is merely a mental affliction rather than a real, lived experience. But we never move beyond the intriguing set-up and down into the enlightening details. Fidel repeats the anguished cry again and again: “I know who I am.” The trouble is that we, the audience, do not. What is his background? How has he reached this point of crisis? At the very least, what is he feeling beyond this frustratingly anonymous sense of anger and displacement? All these questions remain buried in the corners of Fidel’s mind. The most revealing moment is bound up in some lovely movement work from Shane Shambhu. Miked up to the max, Fidel breathes heavily and deeply. He practises what looks a lot like tai chi and, despite remaining still, finally begins to own the stage on which he stands. Fidel’s body stays rooted to the spot but his arms and legs seem to move independently, with beautiful and arresting freedom.
