3/11/2022,"Billionaires interested in buying Chelsea Football Club have been told to approach the UK government with potential takeover proposals, after the sanctioning of its current oligarch owner, Roman Abramovich. Fearing the threat of sanctions, Abramovich, 55, had been rushing to sell the club for more than £3bn, drawing interest from the British property magnate Nick Candy, the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, the US private equity billionaire and Crystal Palace shareholder Josh Harris, and the American part owner of the LA Dodgers Todd Boehly. However, the government on Thursday froze Abramovich’s UK assets, including Chelsea and a portfolio of luxury properties including a £150m mansion yards from Kensington Palace, west London, and a £30m three-storey penthouse overlooking Stamford Bridge. Abramovich was one of seven Russians with close links to Putin that the government added to the sanctions list in a move designed to dramatically increase pressure on the Kremlin over its invasion of Ukraine. “The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands,” Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, said. “They should hang their heads in shame.” Chris Philp, the digital and technology minister, said on Friday that Abramovich would be prevented from selling the club but potential buyers could approach the government with proposals to buy the club as long as Abramovich would not benefit from the deal. “As the license conditions are written today, the sale would not be allowed,” Philp told Sky News. “However, if a buyer emerged it would be open to that buyer or to that football club to approach the government and ask for the conditions to be varied in a way that allows that sale to take place. “To be clear, no proposal would be accepted which saw the proceeds from any sale ending in an unrestricted bank account owned by Abramovich. He can’t benefit from the proceeds of any sale.” Candy, who with his brother Christian developed the luxury One Hyde Park development, on Friday said he was considering submitting a bid to buy the club form the government. “We are examining the details of yesterday’s announcement and we are still interested in making a bid,” his spokesperson said. “Clearly this is a time of great uncertainty for all Chelsea fans. In our view, no one is the owner of a football club – you are the custodian of it for the fans and the community.” Club executives met government officials on Thursday and are expected to continue talks in the coming days. A source in Westminster said the government believes that a sale of the club should be possible to arrange with relative ease. It remains to be seen if the government intends to requisition Chelsea before allowing a sale to go through. It has been suggested that the proceed of the sale would be frozen or placed into a charitable fund. Raine Group, the New York investment bank Abramovich appointed to sell the club, told bidders on Thursday that the sale had been “paused” while “the parties consider the implications of the developments and discuss next steps with the relevant UK authorities”. As well as Candy, Wyss, Boehly and Harris, a number of other mostly US-based business are understood to have formed consortiums to consider submitting bids. Fears are mounting that Chelsea could collapse into administration if a sale is not agreed soon as sanctions prevent the club from collecting match-day income and sponsors begin to terminate contracts. The club has been granted a special licence to allow it continue to play matches for the rest of the season, but only season ticket holders and fans who have already bought tickets will be able to attend matches. Chelsea will only be allowed to make payments “essential to the continuation of the operation of the club”. Three, the British telecoms company that is the team’s principal shirt sponsor, last night suspended its £40m a year partnership with the club. Hyundai, its shirt sleeve sponsor worth a reported £10m, said it was “assessing the situation with Chelsea FC”. Nike, which signed a £900m 15-year sponsorship deal with the club in 2016, was reported to be “considering walking away”, according to the Mail.

3/11/2022,"Kim Little and her Arsenal teammate Leah Williamson are reflecting on the role football can play in changing lives. The pair have just left a close to hour-long Zoom call with women and girls in the Za’atari refugee camp in Jordan, the world’s largest refugee camp for Syrians who have fled the war in their homeland. “We play football and people watch us, but I think for us, as a club, as a team and as individuals, the societal impact is way more important,” Little says. “That’s more lasting past football. When we retire from playing it’s not just: ‘Oh, I played OK on the pitch, we did this, we won this.’ Imagine if we can look back in five or 10 years’ time, when I’m not playing, and can say we maybe had an impact on ordinary people’s lives to go and study law or travel? I’d take that any day over winning trophies.” On Zoom on International Women’s Day were two junior coaches, 16-year-old Nada and 17-year-old Sondos, a 42-year-old mother of five and coach, Salma, and 12-year-old Reem. All are a part of the Coaching for Life programme co-created by The Arsenal Foundation and Save the Children that is in its seventh 20-week cycle. “I used to live in Bloudan, a village near Damascus,” Salma says. “As the situation got worse there, I moved to Daraa in 2012 but it was still dangerous. In Daraa, a sniper shot my 16-year-old son and he died from the injury five days later. I fled Syria with my then husband and children and arrived at the Za’atari refugee camp in 2013.” Nada arrived with her three sisters and one brother in 2014; Sondos in 2012 with 10 family members and joined Coaching for Life with her 16-year-old divorced sister; Reem came aged two, brought by her parents with her three sisters and brother. Life in the camp is difficult, says the director of The Arsenal Foundation, Mairead King, who last visited in November: “It’s pretty harsh. There isn’t much colour and there isn’t much life. Over the years the structures have become more permanent. It’s corrugated structures, but you might have three or four families living in one of those. It’s in the middle of the desert so everything’s dusty and there’s 80,000 people and 40,000 of them are kids. Maybe six years ago people still thought they would go back to Syria, but now people talk about the camp being their home. It’s been a journey for many families to come to terms with that, to realise that they’re actually probably not going back.” Gradually things have been added. There are schools, supermarkets and a street they call the Champs-Élysées where makeshift shops sell all sorts, even wedding dresses, but the buildings are basically shacks. The one patch of green is home to the pitches built and operated by the Coaching for Life programme. The project, which you can donate to here, marries the Arsenal Foundation’s experience of working with underprivileged kids in north London, including those that had been involved in knife crime, to build a sense of belonging with Save the Children’s experience of conflict areas and humanitarian crises. “Some kids, particularly in the early days, when they were quite traumatised, were really withdrawn and they didn’t want to go to school,” King says. “But if a couple of their mates were going to a football pitch and there was a sense of play and a sense of fun, gradually you could cajole them out of themselves. Football has the power to do that, and has the power to bring them together, and then once we get them together, then that’s when we can give psychosocial support.” In the past two years the rates of child marriage and gender-based violence have increased in the camp as pre-existing gender inequalities have been exacerbated by the pandemic. As part of the programme, which operates around schooling, girls are taught how to stand up for their rights to education, sport and how to advocate for themselves. As Reem, Sondos and Nada quiz Williamson and Little on what goes through their heads when in a position to score or one-on-one in defence, who their role models are, what makes Little a good captain and whether they thought they might lose after conceding twice against Birmingham last Sunday, the problems of the camp feel very far away. Poignantly, when Williamson and Little ask the girls what their aspirations are, the ambition is not to be a footballer or coach: “I want to continue my education and study law”, “I want to travel, I don’t know where, outside the camp”, “I want Coaching for Life to expand to include children with disabilities that are bullied in school and the community”, “I want my children to all graduate”. They leave the players speechless. The experience has Williamson and Little thinking about football and its role. “We have conversations on the coach, we’ll sit and talk about everything but football really, but I’m finding it hard at the minute, especially with Ukraine, that we keep stepping out on to a pitch and that life is normal here,” says Williamson. “I am battling with that a little bit. But at the same time, you struggle to find a place where you can actually have an impact and for us to have an impact on those girls is to go out and play well on the weekend.” Little chimes in: “It’s not completely pointless because you are having an impact on people but in the grand scheme of things it’s so irrelevant. In the football world, male and female, we are in this bubble and we get to do a job where we get this tunnel vision sometimes.” Williamson agrees: “You have to remember it is so irrelevant. It’s an incredible, powerful thing that lots of good can come out of and right now us continuing to play, continuing to just be, is the best thing, because we can’t do anything else. But if you offered me a chance to go and visit that camp at the weekend instead of playing my game it would be a moral dilemma. What’s more important when you actually really start to think about it? Yet we are in a performance sport where if we don’t win, or if we don’t play well, then we don’t have that impact. So it’s a constant existential conversation.” Little likes that. “That’s a good mentality to have when you’re going into anything,” she says. “What’s the broader purpose? Football is a small part of the world but everything is there to make it go round.”",Sport/Football,‘Football has power’: how Arsenal are helping Syrian refugees in Jordan,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/11/arsenal-helping-syrian-refugees-in-jordan-football-power
3/11/2022,"“As I write to you, rockets are flying outside my windows, and at a distance of 20km from my house, Russian aggressors are destroying the suburbs of Kyiv,” author Larysa Denysenko says in an email. “Mariupol, home to more than 400,000 people, is left without water, heat and food due to violations of international humanitarian law. One child died of dehydration today.” Denysenko, a Ukrainian writer, lawyer and public activist, is emailing about her children’s book Maya and Her Friends, illustrated by Ukrainian artist Masha Foya, which will be released by Bonnier Books UK in April. All of the company’s profits from the book will be donated to Unicef and their efforts to support the children of Ukraine in the ongoing invasion. Maya and Her Friends was written in the wake of the annexation of Crimea by Russia in 2014, and the occupation by Russia of part of Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Its story of children and their different home lives has taken on new resonance during the conflict, as families flee and split apart. For the forthcoming edition of the book – which is also being published in Finland, Poland and Germany on 12 April – Denysenko has added a new introduction, written from the corridor she was hiding in with her mother and dog during a missile scare. Denysenko, a member of the human-rights organisation PEN Ukraine, wanted to add to the book to talk about “how the fate of children has changed due to the war that cripples people’s lives in Ukraine”. “I think the story itself is genius,” said Denysenko’s UK publisher, Helen Wicks. “Larysa is a very talented communicator and I think that the story’s got such resonance.” Originally published in 2017 in Ukraine, under the name Maya and Her Moms, the book is the story of a class of pupils, each with a different type of family. It became a bestseller in the country but drew criticism for its portrayal of a young girl with two mothers; Denysenko, Foya and the publishers were the subject of threats and harassment. Unicef estimates that hundreds of thousands of children are among the refugees that have fled Ukraine, and of these “many are unaccompanied or have been separated from their parents or family members”. The book’s central message, then, is more relevant than ever, with Denysenko saying she wrote it to “help every child in Ukraine feel protected, whether they have both father and mother, or just one mother, or two mothers, or two fathers, or a stepfather or stepmother”. Denysenko remains in Kyiv – and from there she’s determined to get her book out. “I believe that cultural diplomacy, the language of books, can help people to empathise, to fight for other people’s lives,” she says. “With this book, I want to appeal to the people of the democratic world: we are here, not far from you, we are people of freedom and peace. We have never attacked another country. Our children are talented, brave, beautiful and strong. We deserve the whole world to join us in fighting the war and against the killing of children. “I can’t fight with a weapon in hand, but the word also matters in these circumstances.”",Arts/Books,Ukrainian children’s book to be published in UK as charity fundraiser,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/mar/11/ukrainian-childrens-book-to-be-published-in-uk-as-charity-fundraiser
3/11/2022,"Katy Perry has won her appeal in a copyright case over her 2013 hit Dark Horse. The musician will no longer have to pay $2.8m (£2.1m) to the rapper Flame (real name Marcus Gray), who claimed that her single plagiarised an eight-note ostinato from his 2009 song, Joyful Noise. Gray sued Perry and co-defendants including Capitol Records in 2016 and was initially awarded $2.8m in a jury verdict three years later. Perry appealed and a federal district court judge vacated the verdict in March 2020. A judge from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has now ruled that Gray was attempting to claim an “improper monopoly” over conventional “musical building blocks”. The ostinatos in Perry and Gray’s respective songs “consist entirely of commonplace musical elements, and … the similarities between them do not arise out of an original combination of these elements”, the new ruling reads. To allow copyright over this material would limit musical creativity, the judge ruled, amounting “to allowing an improper monopoly over two-note pitch sequences or even the minor scale itself, especially in light of the limited number of expressive choices available when it comes to an eight-note repeated musical figure”. The ruling in Perry’s favour comes amid a renewed flush of A-list musicians facing copyright lawsuits. Ed Sheeran has been defending allegations that he copied parts of his 2017 hit Shape of You from a song written by Sami Chokri and Ross O’Donoghue in the high court this week. Dua Lipa is facing two lawsuits over her 2020 hit single Levitating, one brought by a Florida reggae band, the other by two disco songwriters.

3/11/2022,"The Metropolitan police breached the rights of the organisers of a planned vigil for Sarah Everard in the way they handled the planned event, high court judges have ruled, in a decision hailed as a “victory for women”. Reclaim These Streets (RTS) proposed a socially distanced vigil for the 33-year-old, who was murdered by a serving Met officer, Wayne Couzens, near to where she went missing in Clapham, south London, in March last year. Four women who founded RTS and planned the vigil brought a legal challenge against the force over its handling of the event, which was also intended to be a protest about violence against women. They withdrew from organising the vigil after being told by the force they would face fines of £10,000 each and possible prosecution if the event went ahead, and a spontaneous vigil and protest took place instead. At a two-day hearing in January, Jessica Leigh, Anna Birley, Henna Shah and Jamie Klingler argued that decisions made by the force in advance of the planned vigil amounted to a breach of their human rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and say the force did not assess the potential risk to public health. In a judgment handed down on Friday, Lord Justice Warby and Mr Justice Holgate ruled in favour of RTS, finding that the Met’s decisions in the run-up to the event were “not in accordance with the law”. In a statement outside the Royal Courts of Justice on behalf of the four women who organised the vigil, their solicitor Theodora Middleton said: “Today’s judgment is a victory for women. “Last March, women’s voices were silenced. Today’s judgment conclusively shows that the police were wrong to silence us. “The decisions and actions by the Met police in the run-up to the planned vigil for Sarah Everard last year were unlawful and the judgment sets a powerful precedent for protest rights. “We came together one year and one day ago to organise a vigil on Clapham Common because Sarah Everard went missing from our neighbourhood. We felt sad and afraid. “We were angry that women still weren’t safe and we were tired of the burden to stay safe always weighing on our shoulders.” In a summary of the ruling, Lord Justice Warby said: “The relevant decisions of the [Met] were to make statements at meetings, in letters, and in a press statement, to the effect that the Covid-19 regulations in force at the time meant that holding the vigil would be unlawful. “Those statements interfered with the claimants’ rights because each had a ‘chilling effect’ and made at least some causal contribution to the decision to cancel the vigil. “None of the [force’s] decisions was in accordance with the law; the evidence showed that the [force] failed to perform its legal duty to consider whether the claimants might have a reasonable excuse for holding the gathering, or to conduct the fact-specific proportionality assessment required in order to perform that duty.” The Met defended the claim brought by RTS and argued there was no exception for protest in the coronavirus rules at the time, and that it had “no obligation” to assess the public health risk. In a statement after the ruling the Met said it was “considering very carefully” whether it should appeal. Met assistant commissioner Louisa Rolfe said: “The Met is mindful that this judgment has potential implications in other circumstances for how a proportionality assessment is to be carried out when considering enforcement action. This may apply beyond policing the pandemic. Even in the context of the regulations that kept us safe during the pandemic, this may have important consequences. “The Met unreservedly endorses the principle that fundamental freedoms, such as those exercised by the claimants in this case, may only be restricted where it is necessary and proportionate for a lawful purpose. Consideration of an appeal is in no way indicative that the Met do not consider such protections to be of the utmost importance. It is, however, incumbent on the Met to ensure that this judgment does not unduly inhibit its ability, and that of police forces across the country, to effectively balance competing rights in a way that is operationally deliverable.”",News/UK news,"Met police breached rights of organisers of Sarah Everard vigil, court rules",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/met-police-breached-rights-of-organisers-of-sarah-everard-vigil-court-rules
3/11/2022,"Here is an audaciously inventive, sparky yet sensitive, giddily enjoyable new play that deserves to be packed to the rafters with kids on school trips. Ross Willis has created an extraordinary exploration of adolescence with his tale of 12-year-old Sonny, who invents a superhero, Captain Chatter, to help him with his stammer. It is brilliantly performed in this dream of a production from director Sally Cookson, complete with eye-popping projections, a lurid lime-and-orange colour scheme and stunningly expressive physicality all round. Raphel Famotibe makes a confident stage debut as Sonny, whose homemade comic books introduce us to Captain Chatter (the superb Ramesh Meyyappan, dressed as a sort of space-age sprinter). Sonny’s relationship with him veers from sidekick to nemesis: Captain Chatter helps save him from having to speak in public but Sonny must ultimately learn to live without him, especially when he lands a role in his school’s production of Hamlet. This push-and-pull is reflected in Sonny’s new friendship with the lippy Roshi (a barnstorming Juliet Agnes), who lives on his estate, and his relationship with his teacher Miss Wainwright (Amanda Lawrence, hardboiled yet soft-centred). Wainwright is locked in battle with the callous headteacher, Miss Fish, who is the school’s real bully and symbolises a wider ideology of labelling children rather than striving to understand them. Jenny Fitzpatrick, in hiss-worthy mode as Miss Fish, doubles as Sonny’s mother in scenes that sting with sadness. The play considers specific experiences and misconceptions around stammering alongside other themes of communication, especially regarding mental health. Willis’s mastery of words is matched by the fonts used in the creative captioning on screen from designer Tom Newell: comic-book kapows jostle with Shakespeare, ghoulish grindhouse dialogue with textspeak, heartfelt eloquence with a flood of F-bombs from teachers and students alike, institutional jargon with scatological puns. As the insults ping (“Miss, did you fight in the second world war?”), it feels as if the whole thing is harnessing the energy of a Year 8 classroom. Willis can make quotidian detail startling: a missing dog sign is printed in comic sans, the description of someone’s eye colour becomes an insult. Even the stage directions ping: “Sonny rips out his vocal cords” leads to one particularly haunting physical sequence. Laila Diallo’s movement direction is felt in every performance, from Sonny’s fury and frustration to Miss Fish’s officious strut. Katie Sykes’ design – lit by Aideen Malone – consistently surprises (those weaponised quills!) and there is a compelling variety in Benji Bower’s electro score, played by a band above the stage, and in Jonathan Everett’s sound. By rights, this school-life play should go straight on the curriculum, and not just because it offers an eye-wateringly funny, expletive-laden synopsis of Hamlet and a richly resonant interpretation of Shakespeare’s opening lines. Willis’s play unfolds itself in miraculous ways. It’s some kind of wonderful.

3/11/2022,"“If I want to work 20 minutes a week, or 30 hours, I can do that,” says a worker in a mysterious new TV ad. “When I need a day off to study for a big exam, I can do that,” says another. The ad isn’t for a jobs site or any one employer. It’s been made by a new lobbying group called Flex, which calls itself the “voice of the app-based economy”, and is backed by gig work mainstays including Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and Instacart. Flex seeks to defend the business models of these companies, which use workers labeled as independent contractors, amid a renewed push in Washington to pass labor laws that would defend those workers’ right to unionize and strike. Joe Biden made a renewed call in his State of the Union address for the passage of the Pro Act, which would expand the federal definition of employees to include gig workers. Flex’s website takes a veiled shot at the legislation: “Policymakers want to implement a one-size-fits-all employment model for all workers, regardless of their needs or desires,” it claims, under the headline “Independence Works”. It shows pictures of smiling college students, parents and teachers alongside apparent testimonials from people without surnames. “Let’s say I want to work a few hours outside of my regular job to save for my kid’s college. I can do that,” says one Ricardo P. “Independence works, ’cause I’m the boss around here,” says Ian W, handily repeating Flex’s tagline verbatim. But workers and labor advocates are already pushing back against Flex’s narrative. Nicole Moore, a Los Angeles-based rideshare driver, told the Guardian that gig economy apps are designed to control workers who usually don’t have the means to say no. Moore described a daily frustration that she and other drivers face: apps like Uber and Lyft don’t give her the details of a ride, such as its distance, expected time, and pay, until after she’s accepted it – at which point she has little choice but to follow through, even if it loses her money. “I find out that it’s going to take me 45 minutes to go five miles, and I’m going to get about $5 for the ride. My only choice then is to either basically do volunteer work by accepting the ride, or canceling it. And we are disciplined, and threatened with being terminated, if we cancel it. “So don’t call me an independent contractor, because that’s not what we are.” Moore said that the gig companies’ narrow definition of “flexibility” only focuses on scheduling. But real flexibility, she said, would mean providing “things like family leave, medical leave and paid parental leave.” Veena Dubal, a labor law professor at UC Hastings said the gig companies’ tactics were “insidious and very seductive” because “the vast majority of people in the US don’t understand the difference between employees and independent contractors”. “They try and capture one aspect of what workers really need and want, which is scheduling flexibility, and spend millions of dollars trying to convince regulators, voters and workers themselves that this is impossible within a structure of employment in which the companies have to provide a minimum wage and benefits,” said Dubal. “In fact, there’s no legal restriction on providing flexibility to employees – nothing is preventing them right now from providing both flexibility and benefits,” she added. “What they’re doing is undoing a century’s worth of the labor movement’s fight for a living wage.” In a statement to the Guardian, Flex’s CEO, Kristin Sharp, said: “App-based work is fundamentally different from traditional employee-based work, which is why people turn to it in the first place. It’s not just about scheduling. It’s also about where and how people work. “Nationally, app-based workers spend an average of eight hours a week working on these platforms and most turn to it for supplemental income,” Sharp’s statement continued. “We believe there is a way to support app-based workers without limiting their independence and are eager to work with policymakers, community leaders, and workers across the country to find forward-thinking solutions.” Sharp is a former senior staffer for Senator Mark Warner, one of three current Democratic holdouts impeding the Pro Act’s passage in the Senate. In 2020, the gig companies spent a record-breaking $200m on an all-out ad war to pass Prop 22, a California ballot initiative that offered gig workers partial benefits, while exempting the companies from a landmark labor law, AB5, which would have required the apps to classify their workers as employees with full labor rights. That law has since been declared unconstitutional by a state judge, though its backers have appealed the ruling. Before it passed, Prop 22 was marketed as a progressive measure, with its backers touting its minimum wage for gig workers, and a partial healthcare stipend for workers who met a certain threshold of hours worked. But since the law took effect, a survey has found most California rideshare workers have not received healthcare benefits, and many drivers have reported their pay has decreased. A 2019 study by UC Berkeley estimated the law’s effective minimum wage at $5.64 an hour, since it doesn’t take into account the time drivers spend waiting to be assigned their next ride. Dubal said the gig companies promoted the measure by co-opting the language of racial justice in the wake of the nationwide protests over George Floyd’s death. “They used the faces of black and brown workers smiling, claiming falsely in ads that Prop 22 was going to give them new rights,” she said. “The companies said, ‘Look, these workers are desperate. We’re giving them a few crumbs. You should vote for Prop 22.’ And they did an incredibly effective job of confusing people.” Last week, Washington state’s legislature quietly passed a gig-company backed bill, HB2076, that would offer limited benefits to gig workers while exempting the gig companies from important labor laws. A member of a union that backed the bill told reporter Luis Feliz Leon the union had no choice after the gig companies threatened a repeat of Prop 22. “They will misinform the public with a barrage of TV ads, so we will lose an initiative,” the union member said. “We could lose everything.” Moore expects Flex to follow the same playbook. “You hear a lie enough times it starts to become truth,” she said. “And that was their approach to having Prop 22 become law. They lied to drivers and they lied to voters about what it was going to do. They said this was the only way to keep passenger prices down. That’s a lie; passenger prices have skyrocketed. They told drivers they would give them security and it would give them flexibility. It’s done neither. “We eat all the costs of operating a billion-dollar company’s fleet,” the rideshare worker added. “The flexibility they’re protecting is their own flexibility.”",News/Business,‘Insidious and seductive’: Uber funds lobbying group campaigning to stop gig workers unionising,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/11/uber-funds-new-lobbying-group-to-deny-rights-for-gig-workers
3/11/2022,"It had been 20 years since I’d seen my aunt. In that time I’d lived a full life, written a book and had a baby, but as she stared at my bottom, I knew what she was thinking. Then she said it: “Are you competing with Mary?” There was some skill here: in a few words, she’d deftly managed to insult both my cousin and me. The subtext was: you’ve got as fat as her. Fuelled by post-partum hormones, I decided to tell my aunt, for the first time, how insulting I found this. “I’m sorry,” she said, “if you chose to take offence at what I said.” Ah. The apology rendered immediately void by the word if. Expecting any apology at all was ambitious, because I come from a family who largely can’t and don’t apologise (strange, given we are all Catholics). The sorrys are either histrionic and overplayed, or never manifest – the idea being, I guess, that if you don’t say sorry, did it even happen? I’ve also always been confused at the very English “never apologise never explain,” maxim, supposedly a sign of status. Because of all this, I’ve had a lifelong fascination with apologies, and a lot of them, including my own, are sometimes lacking. Why is this? Why is it so hard to say sorry? There are several types of apology. The automatic “Sorry I bumped into you”; the “Sorry, after you” in a queue; and the very British sorry for someone else’s misdemeanour, like when they stand on your toe. We say a lot of these silly sorrys. There’s also sorry said in sympathy or sorry to sympathise: “I’m sorry to hear that” or “I’m sorry: that sounds hard.” But the sorry that matters is the one aimed at healing hurt – when we recognise we’ve done wrong and want to make amends. This is not an easy sorry. It requires more than mere vocabulary, which is why teaching children to say sorry by saying “Say sorry” is not a robust parenting tool. The ingredients for a good apology are: authenticity, recognition, empathy, ability to take responsibility, and, finally, a good dose of vulnerability and humble pie. It’s a grownups’ word, yet few grownups use it well. If it lacks these things, it doesn’t “land”, said child and adolescent psychotherapist Alison Roy. This is why we so often feel short-changed after an apology, especially an official one: we were wronged with the original fault, and wronged again in the supposed apology. In fact, we can end up feeling manipulated. Corporate-speak is now so clever: we are apologised to with such regularity, yet never feel anyone has really said sorry. Train companies: I’m looking at you. “An apology has to be meaningful if anyone, but especially children, is going to make sense of it,” said Roy. “It should be a way to reconnect [with the person you’ve wronged]. But coping with feelings of shame, of having got something wrong, of being a flawed human being, is quite a sophisticated thing. These are not easy emotions and experiences, so we can’t just expect our children to understand by giving them a word. We have to model it for them.” In other words, we need to practise what we preach. It’s important to start with children because it is usually in childhood that most of us learn to say sorry, or not. It tends to be either modelled well, or not at all. We realise how it leaves us feeling – wretched – and resolve to do better.If we learn to say sorry without thought, all we learn is that sorry is a quick way to get off the hook. There’s no reflection. This often leads to an apology with no change in behaviour, which is pointless and infuriating. And forcing anyone, especially a child, to say sorry to an audience without first finding out what happened can lead to resentment and humiliation: never good in a growing brain. I once taught a writing workshop in a secondary school. One day I did something wrong and said: “Gosh, I’m so sorry.” The class fell silent. “Teachers never say sorry to us, miss,” they told me. This is a common lament among young people: “Adults expect us to say sorry but they never do.” You have only to listen to debates in parliament to tell the good apologies from the bad, and hear how very “playground” some of them sound. In the past 12 months there have been 1,812 “I’m sorry”s from both houses, and counting (the House of Commons tips the Lords at 1090/722), and 1,273 “I apologise”s. Most of these are mere punctuation, and in the case of Boris Johnson, even when he does apologise – and he apologises more than people think – and uses good phrases such as “I take full responsibility” and “I am truly sorry”, it just doesn’t “land”. I often wonder how Johnson was taught to apologise as a child. It’s rather shocking how many of these apologies try to shift the real responsibility: “I’m sorry” followed by a conjunction (if/but/that). Examples include: “I’m sorry that you feel that way,” and “I’m sorry if you took offence.” Familiar, aren’t they? That’s because they are everywhere. Hansard is full of things like, “I’m very sorry to the noble Baroness … that she feels that way.”Is that really being sorry? “It’s the worst kind of apology,” said mediator and conflict resolution expert Gabrielle Rifkind. “Saying ‘I’m sorry you feel that way’ is not a genuine apology. It’s not taking responsibility for your actions; it’s putting the blame back to [the wronged person].” Rifkind once gave me a wonderful tip about building bridges. It involved starting with words to the effect of: “You really matter to me and I want to work out what has gone wrong, so I’m going to do nothing but listen to you for the next 15 minutes.” When was the last time someone said that to you? Exactly, but it’s seductive isn’t it? I’m not sure I would even need an apology with that sort of starter. But it is hard to apologise if we fear reprisals: fear and shame are the enemies of a confident apology. To bloom, apologies need safety and the prospect of being understood. Safety is often lacking because we fear that saying sorry could cost us our relationship, our job or a heap of money. One of the things we’re taught as new drivers is “don’t admit fault” if there’s an accident, even if it is your fault. Psychoanalyst Stephen Blumenthal thinks authentic apologies are more likely in “horizontal, more democratic relationships” – if the person saying sorry and the person wronged are on the same level – than in a more vertical relationship such as boss and employee. This is why siblings and co-workers are more likely to admit to wrongdoing to each other than to parents or bosses, unless of course, they fear being ratted out. “A genuine sorry,” he said, “emanates from a place of wanting to validate and care for the other person, not shame them. We live in a culture of inquisition rather than inquiry, more concerned with identifying a person with an action [of wrongdoing] than curiosity about what’s gone wrong or why.” Some people see it as a sign of power to not say sorry. But the inverse is true. At some point I realised that a good apology, confidently delivered, was like having a superpower. Even something short like “I got it wrong – I’m sorry” can be potent and calming. Or, if you want to go longer: “I can see I’ve upset you and I’m very sorry. I made a mistake. It won’t happen again. What can I do to make it a bit better for you? What do you need?” Notice the use of the “I” word, and “you” only in terms of needs. It isn’t an apology if you shift the blame. One of my favourite apologies of all time was given by former MP Louise Mensch in 2011. She not only owned her behaviour and apologised, but killed any further discussion stone dead. She’d had an email from an investigative journalist accusing her of taking drugs, being drunk and dancing with a famous violinist, all “in front of journalists”. It was done to shame her. Instead of running away from it, she published the email, adding that the incident sounded “highly probable” and that she was pretty sure it was not the “only incident of the kind”. She apologised “to any and all journalists who were forced to watch me dance that night”. A little bit of humour did her no harm, but the power was in her ownership of the incident, leaving no ammunition with which to take further aim at her. Sorrys are not dissimilar to thank-yous. Both are small but mighty. So much grace and joy can be handed over if you use them with meaning, and they can both deliver much misery and hurt if misused, or not used at all. Sometimes, however, people make an apology but it comes too late or is too small, and it can feel hard to accept or move on. Questions to ask yourself here would be: instead of making the sorry the end of something, could it be the beginning of a bigger discussion, along the lines of, “What do I need to do to make it better?” or “Can anything make it better?” If the answer to the latter is “no”, perhaps the sorry is being asked to do too much heavy lifting right then. Time may be needed for healing. But can it start without sorry? I don’t think so. I’m writing a series of children’s books. One is about saying sorry: the protagonist fears that every time they do so, a piece of them goes with the apology and they will lose themselves. The opposite is true – with every genuine sorry, we grow, the other person grows, and so does the connection between us.

3/11/2022,"My daughter is 15 months old, and since I gave birth, my libido has been very low. Sex is the last thing on my mind, which frustrates my husband and makes him feel unwanted. He is understanding and very loving, but I do sense his frustration. Of course, there is intimacy between us and I still feel attracted to him, but caring for our child 24/7 leaves me quite drained, emotionally. I fear that our relationship will be affected and we might get distanced if this carries on for a while. How you feel is completely normal. While some women feel sexual soon after birth, many don’t for some time. Your body and your life have changed; after giving birth, I remember saying to my partner that the only part of me that felt or looked the same was my toenails. You didn’t say anything about the birth, but it too may have had an effect on how you feel, physically and psychologically, even if it was “normal”. But I want to stress that even if everything was as good as it could be, not wanting sex when you have a young baby to look after is OK. I consulted sexual and relationship psychotherapist Jo Coker (cosrt.org.uk), who does a lot of work with postpartum women. “The first thing to do,” she said, “is check that you are physically OK. There are such high expectations of how quickly new parents should click back into normality.” Coker’s advice – since you are asking for help, not because either of us thinks you should be having sex unless you want to – is to build on the intimacy you have with your partner and “try to get back to seeing each other as sexual beings”. This doesn’t have to happen overnight. Remember, from an evolutionary point of view, you are biologically programmed to look after your still very young infant (human mammals are born more helpless than any others). Your hormones may not be saying “sex, sex, sex”, either. Again: normal. Be kind to yourself. How much help and support do you have? Not just to help with the baby, but to help with you? We are social beings and having a baby can be very isolating. Don’t put pressure on yourself – think of yourself first, your sex life second. Talking of sex, as that’s what you’ve written in about: many people think of sex as full intercourse, but it doesn’t have to be. Coker says many couples find “taking sex off the table completely at this stage is really helpful as it takes away the pressure.” You may be feeling that if you touch or kiss your husband, it will have to lead to sex, so you may stop even doing that. Try saying something like, “I still find you attractive, but when I do this or that it means I’m trying to connect, not necessarily that I want to have sex.” This, conversely, can make you feel more like taking things further when you are ready. You could also try “sex snacking”, where you spend just five minutes of attention on each other – so you don’t feel it has to be an entire evening of it. Your husband may be feeling pushed out by the baby (this is common) and needing to feel wanted – he may not want full sex either, just attention of some sort. Talk to each other. Coker recommended a book called The Life of Dad, by Dr Anna Machin, which your husband may find useful. I think you need to be patient with each other. But it sounds as though you’ve got a very positive base from which to explore all of this in time.  Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a family-related problem sent in by a reader.

3/11/2022,"American workers attempting to form unions in their workplaces are pushing the National Labor Relations Board to expand organizing rights – from reinstating the Joy Silk doctrine that makes unionization easier, to banning captive audience meetings held by employers to discourage organizing efforts. Their efforts could transform how unions organize workers in the US, especially amid opposition from employers. Max Capasso, who has worked as a barista at Great Lakes Coffee in Detroit for six months, is one of about 20 workers at the coffee chain currently on strike, demanding their employer recognize their union and collectively bargain with workers. In January, Capasso said, nine baristas at the Midtown location in Detroit tested positive for Covid-19, and management insisted the remaining workers, despite having been exposed, still come into work. The company denies that workers were asked to come into work sick. Capasso and others had been communicating with each other about working conditions and low pay, but the Covid-19 issue prompted them to sign a joint letter requesting that management provide hazard pay and not demand workers return to work without being cleared of the virus. In response, the store location was shut down indefinitely, which incited the union organizing effort with Unite Here Local 24. Twenty out of 24 workers have signed union authorization cards and have been on strike since 16 February to demand recognition. “We clearly have a vast majority, we’ve clearly proven that we are dedicated to this strike and we are dedicated to this union and getting a contract, and they have refused to acknowledge it,” said Capasso. “We are seeking a higher authority to force their hand and come sit at the table with us.” During the third week of the strike, workers filed unfair labor practice charges against Great Lakes Coffee with the NLRB, requesting the board reinstate the Joy Silk doctrine, a policy which stipulates an employer must recognize and bargain collectively with a union unless they have a “good faith doubt” of majority support for the union. Great Lakes Coffee did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the filing. This would make it easier for workers to form unions as they would not have to hold ballot elections to do so, and under Joy Silk, employers would be forced to bargain collectively with the union if found to have broken labor law during a union election process. The Biden administration has repeatedly expressed support for expanding union organizing rights, most recently during the State of the Union address. During the speech, Biden said that “when a majority of workers want to form a union they shouldn’t be stopped,” which was reaffirming support for the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which passed the House last year but has yet to receive a Senate vote. Biden’s new appointees to the NLRB, including the general counsel, Jennifer Abruzzo, have called for several types of cases for regional offices to bring to the NLRB general counsel office, outlining the office’s priorities, including consideration of requesting the NLRB reinstate Joy Silk, which was abandoned by the NLRB around 1970. “Given the many years that we have had since Joy Silk was abandoned, we’ve seen over those years, decade upon decade, employers abuse their power at the workplace where they intimidate employees’ efforts to unionize,” said Risa Lieberwitz, a professor of law and employment law at Cornell University. “Bringing Joy Silk back would be a doctrine that more fully respects workers’ rights to unionize.” Lieberwitz said banning captive audience meetings will probably be more difficult, given employer opposition in citing first amendment rights. But there could be other ways for the board to address the coercive nature of captive audience meetings, such as granting unions equal access and time with workers. “Now is a chance with a new board and this very creative general counsel to really take actions to engage in review and rethinking about how to make the NLRB work the way it was supposed to,” said Lieberwitz. Workers trying to unionize at Amazon in New York and Starbucks workers in Alabama have filed unfair labor practice charges with the NLRB to push for the board to ban captive audience meetings held by employers to discourage unionization efforts, a policy that is also included in the Pro Act. “They’re definitely inherently coercive and we feel absolutely disgusted by Amazon’s union-busting tactics,” said Brett Daniels, an Amazon worker and organizer at JFK8 warehouse in Staten Island, New York. “They need to end and should be banned.” Daniels said that workers are regularly forced to attend captive audience meetings held by Amazon throughout their work week. Under the Trump administration, the NLRB fought to overturn state laws that prohibited or limited employers’ use of captive audience meetings during union campaigns, claiming bans limit the free speech of employers. “There are no first amendment rights there, people are forced to go there. The unions have no way to respond to it and they lie to them,” said Seth Goldstein, a pro bono attorney for the Amazon Labor Union. “Captive audience meetings are inherently coercive and the board has to take action.” Amazon is publicly and aggressively opposing unionization in their warehouses, with a rerun election currently being held in Alabama after the initial results in 2021 were overturned due to Amazon’s conduct during the election. Amazon is pushing workers to vote no in the NLRB elections that the board ordered after a majority of workers expressed interest in unionization through union authorization cards. Amazon and Starbucks have rejected criticisms of captive audience meetings, dubbing them “regular informational meetings” or “listening sessions”. Oregon has a ban on captive audience meetings and Connecticut is currently debating legislation that would grant employees the right to leave these meetings, which business groups strongly oppose.",News/US news,US workers in new push for level playing field in unionization efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/11/us-workers-unionization-nlrb-level-playing-field
3/11/2022,"Good morning. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has accused Russia of being a “terrorist state”after its tanks prevented a delivery of food, water and medicine to the besieged city of Mariupol, and he said Moscow was capable of chemical weapons attacks. As Russian forces appeared to be regrouping in order to encircle Kyiv, and the US planned to ratchet up the economic pressure on Vladimir Putin, Zelenskiy tried to rally Ukrainians with another video address late on Thursday condemning the relentless assault on cities. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s defence minister said Russian forces had killed more Ukrainian civilians than soldiers, and Russian forces have been accused of hitting a psychiatric hospital near the eastern Ukrainian town of Izyum. “This is a war crime against civilians, genocide against the Ukrainian nation,” the regional governor of Kharkiv said. Russia denies targeting civilians. What else is happening? Here’s everything we know on day 16 of the Russian invasion. What happens if Russia cannot pay its debts after western sanctions? While Russia would have had enough foreign currency to cover debt payments, having amassed $630bn in reserves, the US, UK and EU freezing the assets of its central bank have made much of this sum inaccessible. This means it could default. Meanwhile, Russia’s past has raised fears of a large-scale cyberwar targeting Ukraine and its allies, including the US. The likelihood of a criminal investigation and charges against Donald Trump are rising. This is due to allegations by a House panel of a “criminal conspiracy” involving his aggressive drive to overturn the 2020 election results, coupled with a Department of Justice inquiry into a “false electors” scheme that Trump loyalists devised to block Joe Biden from taking office. Former federal prosecutors say evidence is mounting of criminal conduct by Trump that may yield charges of obstructing an official proceeding of Congress on 6 January or defrauding the US government, stemming from his weeks-long drive with senior allies to thwart Biden’s inauguration by pushing false claims of fraud. A 2 March court filing by the House January 6 panel implicated Trump in a conspiracy to block Congress from certifying Biden’s win, and Trump faces legal threats from investigations under way into the “false electors” ploy, and seditious conspiracy charges filed against Oath Keepers who attacked the Capitol, say department veterans. What has the House panel said? The filing by the House panel stated that it had “a good-faith basis for concluding that the president and members of his campaign engaged in a criminal conspiracy to defraud the United States”. The actor Jussie Smollett has been sentenced to 30 months of probation, including 150 days of jail time, and ordered to pay restitution after his conviction for lying to police about a racist and homophobic attack that he orchestrated himself. Smollett, who is Black and gay, reported to police that two men wearing ski masks beat him and hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him on a dark Chicago street. The 39-year-old was also ordered to pay $120,000 in restitution to the city of Chicago and fined $25,000 by Judge James Linn of Cook county circuit court. Linn denied a request to suspend Smollett’s sentence and ordered he be placed in custody immediately. After the sentencing, Smollett removed the face mask he wore throughout the hearing to loudly proclaim his innocence. What did he say? “If I did this, then it means that I stuck my fist in the fears of Black Americans in this country for over 400 years and the fears of the LGBT community,” Smollett said, standing up at the defense table as his lawyers and sheriff’s deputies surrounded him. “Your honor, I respect you and I respect the jury but I did not do this.” The election of an avowed “anti-feminist” as the next president of South Korea has been greeted with dismay, amid accusations that Yoon Suk-yeol has fueled the county’s gender divide. A former senior prosecutor, Yoon defeated the liberal ruling party candidate, Lee Jae-myung, by a margin of 263,000 votes. The mysterious discovery of a mummified body in the walls of a historic convention center in Oakland, California, has prompted an urgent search for answers, as authorities seek to untangle the person’s identity and how they came to be entombed within the building’s walls. The actor and singer Emilio Delgado, a warm and familiar presence in children’s lives for 45 years as the fix-it shop owner Luis on Sesame Street, has died. His wife, Carol Delgado, said he died from the blood cancer multiple myeloma at their home in New York. He was 81. As many as a third of all child deaths from Covid in the US have occurred during the Omicron surge of the pandemic. Children seem to be facing increasing risks from Covid-19, even as mask mandates drop across the country and vaccination rates among children stall out at alarmingly low rates. US inflation surged again last month to a new 40-year high of 7.9%, propelled by surging costs for gas, food and housing. The February figures, the sharpest increase since 1982, are only a foretaste of higher prices to come as they do not factor in the impacts of the Ukraine war, Biden’s ban on Russian energy imports and tightened oil supplies have sent prices at US gas stations and other energy commodities to record levels. In Culver City, a Chinese restaurant is selling bright blue and yellow “freedom dumplings”, the colors of the Ukrainian flag. In West Hollywood, a popular cocktail bar is offering a special “Pruzhnyy”, or resilience, cocktail, made with Ukrainian Khor vodka. Bakeries across California are making special batches of hamentaschen, a Jewish cookie associated with resistance. It’s all part of a wave of solidarity among California chefs, who are using food to show support for Ukrainians after Russia’s invasion and to fundraise for humanitarian relief efforts. As Biden ratchets up the pressure on Russia by banning imports of its oil, and American drivers grumble about rising gasoline prices, a more fundamental demand has emerged – for the US to decisively cut its umbilical reliance on fossil fuels. Environmental groups and progressive Democrats are aiming to build on the backlash to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by ending the era of fossil fuel dependency and help address the unfolding climate crisis. On Monday, as the world watched the war in Ukraine intensify, Nikolai Plyuyko did something extraordinary. He went for an 11km run through the streets of Kyiv. He’s not the only one. In the south of the city, Konstantin Bondarev, 61, has been running long distances since 1983. “Now that there has been war, I’ve been running non-stop; it makes things feel a lot easier during such turbulent times,” he said. “It’s important for people to show that we are alive and strong.

3/11/2022,"Heathrow is to hire 12,000 staff to handle an expected summer holiday boom, the UK’s busiest airport has said as it warned the recovery in the aviation industry is “being overshadowed by war and Covid”. Passenger numbers at the London hub were almost half pre-pandemic levels last month – and 15% below Heathrow’s own forecast – at only 2.8 million passengers. “Aviation’s recovery remains overshadowed by war and Covid uncertainty,” said John Holland-Kaye, the chief executive of Heathrow. “But we need to ensure we are geared up to meet peak potential demand this summer.” The airport said that at the busiest times this summer it expects passenger numbers to hit 85% of pre-pandemic levels. However, it warned the airport would feel significantly busier than that because of additional pre-departure checks, and it needed to embark on a recruitment drive. “This is higher than current airline, handler and airport capacity,” the airport said. “So we are putting passengers first by gearing up across the airport for peak demand, working with airlines to reduce check-in times and recruiting 12,000 new colleagues, as well as reopening Terminal 4 before July.” Heathrow added that it was “particularly concerned over Border Force’s ability to scale up to meet demand” for the summer crowds. The airport said the recovery in inbound traveller numbers remained slow because of testing and quarantine requirements in many overseas markets, and the aviation industry faces a host of additional concerns. “We also face headwinds from higher fuel prices, longer flight times to destinations impacted by airspace closures, concerns from US travellers over war in Europe and the likelihood of new ‘variants of concern’,” the airport said. “Together [these] create huge uncertainty over the passenger forecasts this year.”",News/UK news,"Heathrow to hire 12,000 staff for summer travel boom",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/heathrow-to-hire-12000-staff-for-summer-travel-boom
3/11/2022,"The government has U-turned on guidance to shooters that reclassified pheasants as livestock, meaning that wild birds such as crows could be shot to protect them in certain circumstances, after a furious reaction from the public. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs changed the definition of livestock in its general shooting licences earlier this year. Under the new definition, game birds such as pheasants were considered livestock if given food, water or shelter by a keeper for their survival. That meant that wild birds including carrion crows, jackdaws, rooks and magpies could be shot to protect them. General licences give broad permissions to shoot certain species of wild birds to protect livestock, help conservation and preserve public health and safety. As George Monbiot pointed out on Twitter, however, it also meant that pheasants were “livestock” while they were being fed, but then classified legally as “wildlife” when they were being shot: But you aren't allowed to round up wild animals at the end of the shooting season, and trap them in enclosures, so when the survivors are being rounded up, they become livestock again. The campaign group Wild Justice threatened legal action against Defra, arguing that its move went further than the definition of livestock in the Wildlife and Countryside Act. The licence stated: “‘Livestock’ is as defined in section 27(1) of the 1981 Act. For the purpose of this licence, this expression also includes gamebirds kept in an enclosure or which are free roaming but remain significantly dependent on the provision of food, water or shelter by a keeper for their survival. This does not include supplementary feeding.” But section 27(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 defines livestock as any animal that is kept: (a) for the provision of food, wool, skins or fur;(b) for the purpose of its use in the carrying on of any agricultural activity; or(c) for the provision or improvement of shooting or fishing. Wild Justice argued that the new definition of livestock extended the previous one, and meant that birds released into the wild by shooting estates could be under the same definition as long as there was some food, water or shelter left out for them. The group was particularly concerned that the licence went beyond the definition of livestock in the WCA 1981 to now include gamebirds “kept in an enclosure or which are free roaming but remain significantly dependent on the provision of food, water or shelter by a keeper for their survival”. The WCA definition by contrast only includes gamebirds kept “for the provision or improvement of shooting”. On that definition, Wild Justice argued, once a pheasant is let out of the release pens ready for the shooting season, it is no longer kept for the provision of shooting and so its protection cannot be a lawful reason to kill or take carrion crows, jackdaws, magpies or rooks. Defra agreed to revise the definition, telling Wild Justice’s lawyers: “The secretary of state does not consider pheasants to be livestock within the meaning of the WCA 81 once they cease to be kept”. Officials confirmed that only shelter provided by a gamekeeper “by or within the release pen” is a factor in assessing whether a pheasant is kept or wild. Any shelter that is provided further away does not bring a pheasant back into a gamekeeper’s keeping. Wild Justice said: “It seems that someone in Defra yielded to pressure from the shooting community to expand the definition of gamebirds as livestock. Wild Justice pointed out to the secretary of state, George Eustice, that he doesn’t have that power and his department has overstepped the mark. We won. “Defra has usefully stressed the need, which has always existed, for non-lethal means to be tried before lethal ones. Will this limit the number of birds killed to ‘protect’ gamebirds? It might, and if there were any sensible monitoring it would, but in practice probably not as too many shooting interests routinely break wildlife laws in any case.” Defra has been contacted for comment.",News/UK news,Outcry prompts U-turn over killing wild birds to protect game birds in England,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/11/outcry-prompts-u-turn-over-killing-wild-birds-to-protect-game-birds-in-england
3/11/2022,"My dad, David Roberts, who has died aged 70 of cancer, was an environmentalist who spent 35 years working for Greenpeace, sailing around the world on their ships, including on all three Rainbow Warrior vessels. Originally a merchant seaman, he began volunteering as a mate on Greenpeace ships in the early 1980s, ending up as a direct action coordinator. During his career he was involved in more than 250 direct actions and was arrested 39 times in 13 countries, three times for spying. He was teargassed, bombed, shot at, had a Scud missile fired at him, was trapped in a mine field, had a stun grenade dropped on his head, was irradiated, covered in toxic waste, trapped inside an upturned boat, faced a firing squad and nearly died in a helicopter crash. Born in Buckland, Oxfordshire, David was the youngest of five boys. In 1962 his parents, Reginald and Elizabeth (nee Wright), took over the Red Lion pub in Avebury, Wiltshire, where he spent his early teenage years. In 1966, aged 16, he followed three of his older brothers to sea and joined the merchant navy. He signed up to Greenpeace on a voluntary basis in 1982, and the following year became the first paid crew member of one of their ships. Former colleagues recount that he was rarely in the spotlight but was frequently the mastermind behind high-profile campaigns. He had a talent for motivating people and thinking up hare-brained, out-of-the-box, but essentially peaceful direct action strategies. He was instrumental in the logistics involving the escape of Greenpeace’s Sirius ship from detention after an action against Bayer in Antwerp in 1985; in penetrating the security shield protecting a plutonium shipment in the Panama Canal in 1998; and, in 2003, in helping to block a shipment of arms to Iraq. David was a larger-than-life character and this, together with his imposing height, red hair, explosive temper and immense sense of humour, meant he made an impression on all he met. In his lifetime he travelled to more than 130 countries and sent his children, and later his grandchildren, a postcard from nearly every place he visited. At heart David was a naturalist, and in retirement he loved nothing better than studying trees or watching birds. He was a talented wood craftsman. In his last months, when he was not recounting tales of his adventures on his blog, he was converting a van, Marjorie, into a home to travel around Europe. He was a big fan of John Lennon and the Beatles, and was passionate about politics and world affairs. As a family, we had no real idea what he had been getting up to in his professional life until after he died, when the numerous tributes to him from colleagues gave us an insight into some of his adventures. He is survived by six children – Jemima and me from his first marriage to Susan Roberts (nee Jeary), which ended in divorce, Maia from his relationship with Lorena Lastra, and Léo, Sam and John from his second marriage, to Katia Kanas, which also ended in divorce – as well as his grandchildren, Tabitha, Myfanwy, Gwynfi, Violet and Adrian, and three brothers, Ian, Michael and Christopher.",News/Environment,David Roberts obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/11/david-roberts-obituary
3/11/2022,"It was the type of night that only the NBA in all its soap-operatic, meme-friendly, hyper-petty splendor can deliver. Ben Simmons’ first appearance in Philadelphia since demanding a trade from the 76ers over the summer was always going to be extra in all the messiest ways, but Thursday night’s wildly entertaining homecoming somehow managed to exceed the weeks of mounting hype that preceded it. And not because the game itself was in any way competitive, for it certainly was not. The sellout crowd of 21,408 rollicking fans who came to release more than nine months of pent-up frustration wound up booing their own team in the fourth quarter as the visiting Brooklyn Nets led by as many as 32 points in a wire-to-wire 129-100 beatdown of the hometown Sixers. The prevailing tenor of Philadelphia’s most anticipated regular-season game in two decades was more WWE than NBA. Three weeks after landing with Brooklyn in a trade he’d spent months lobbying for, having been branded the primary culprit of a disastrous playoff exit at the hands of the Atlanta Hawks, Simmons returned to South Philly as a larger-than-life heel: the devil wears Louis Vuitton. That he didn’t even dress for Thursday’s game as he continues to recover from a back injury and work back to match fitness after a 54-game holdout was almost immaterial. Philadelphia is a city where people care a little too much about sports and the mania around Thursday night’s nationally televised matchup did little to dispel that reputation. While Simmons attempted to keep a low profile around town, he was mobbed by angry hordes the few times he surfaced in public in episodes that were quickly disseminated on social media. Both of the city’s two 24-hour sports-talk radio stations took calls from so-called Benablers confessing their sins and debated for hours whether he was Philly’s most hated athlete of all time (with the consensus pointing to yes). Queues of ticket-holders formed outside the entrances of the Wells Fargo Center more than an hour before doors opened. And from the moment Simmons emerged from the tunnel roughly 55 minutes before the opening tip in a sleeveless black tee, a deafening chorus of boos cascaded down from the mezzanine on par with anything you’d see on Monday Night Raw. After the starting lineups were announced Simmons took his seat midway down the Brooklyn bench wearing an eye-catching yellow and black designer football shirt that stood out amid the Nets’ signature monochrome. While it was officially the Sixers’ 65th contest of the 82-game regular season, an unmistakable playoff atmosphere crackled in the building with every seat of the 20,478-seat arena occupied, standing room tickets fetching $250 on the open market and gaggles of famous athletes (Allen Iverson, Julius Erving and Jalen Hurts) and rappers (Meek Mill, Lil Baby and Travis Scott) watching from courtside. A heightened security presence including both uniformed and plain-clothes guards was evident around the Brooklyn bench, their intervention thankfully not necessary until the ejection of one lone heckler in the fourth quarter. James Harden, the 2018 NBA MVP who joined the Sixers in the Simmons trade, crossed half-court to greet several of his former team-mates during the pre-game shootaround. Simmons had no interaction with any Philadelphia player – hardly a surprise amid this week’s legitimately hilarious news that he changed his phone number without telling anyone on the team – though he did say a quick hello to Sixers coach Doc Rivers before the start of the second half. The intensity of the BS sideshow made it easy to forget there was an actual basketball game to be played. It wasn’t immediately clear that the Sixers remembered either. Philadelphia entered Thursday’s affair having won all five of their contests with Harden in the lineup, but the Nets represented the new-look Sixers’ biggest test yet and, regrettably, their 10-time All-Star combo guard shrunk from the moment. Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and Seth Curry combined for 49 of Brooklyn’s 71 first-half points, taking the sting out of the “Fuck Ben Sim-mons!” chants that echoed through the arena as the Nets raced out to an early lead and never let the Sixers back within touching distance. “I think all of us look at Ben as our brother,” said Durant, who scored 18 of his team-high 25 points before the intermission. “We knew this was a hostile environment. It’s hard to chant at Ben Simmons when you’re losing by that much.” While Thursday’s game turned out to be a dud, the buzz in the room somehow never dipped, at least until the very end, and the enthusiasm carried over to NBA Twitter. The sight of Durant and Joel Embiid jawing with one another near the end of the first quarter brought the crowd to its feet and prompted LeBron James to chime in from the couch. Even after the proceedings had long since gotten out of hand with eight minutes left and the Sixers down 30, the building exploded in another round of thunderous boos when Simmons stood up from his seat to retrieve a dead ball for the referees. When the horn finally sounded, Simmons congratulated a couple of his teammates in front of Brooklyn’s bench before abruptly turning and disappearing into the tunnel. “It was a good environment to start, but it didn’t feel that way when we got off the court,” Durant said. “No matter who were playing tonight, we were locked in.” Simmons’ evolution from franchise player to Philadelphia’s most despised sportsperson ever isn’t as straightforward as a star player leaving town for greener pastures. After the Sixers chose him with the No 1 overall pick of the 2016 NBA draft and made him the centerpiece of an audacious and controversial rebuild known as the Process, he showed early promise in winning Rookie of the Year honors and making three All-Star teams. But Simmons’ inability to drill the weaknesses in his game – shooting, most notably – were too often nakedly exposed when the lights burned brightest. It all came to a head during last year’s shock Eastern Conference semi-final defeat to the Hawks, where game by game he shot less and did less, missing more foul shots than he made overall and effectively reducing the Sixers to 4 v 5 on offense until the spiritual coup de grâce: his mystifying passed-up dunk in the closing minutes of Game 7. But until the end, Philadelphia’s notoriously critical fans offered steadfast support of their flawed star in the hopes that he could turn things around. All of it has informed the divorce with a particularly acute pain. The good news? The best may be yet to come for pair of star-laden clubs with intertwining fates separated by 100 miles of Interstate 95. The Nets entered Thursday’s game having lost 17 of their previous 21 games, but made it clear that when everything is clicking they’re among the NBA’s most fearsome packages. And with the Sixers holding near the top of the Eastern Conference standings, there’s a reasonably good chance these two teams could meet in the first round of the playoffs. “This is only our sixth game together as a unit,” Harden said. “I’m still trying to figure things out. But tonight was good for us. We got our ass kicked.”",Sport/Sport,Ben Simmons’ Philadelphia return was the NBA at its soap-operatic finest,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/11/ben-simmons-return-philadelphia-76ers-brooklyn-nets
