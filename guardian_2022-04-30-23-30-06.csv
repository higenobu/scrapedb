4/30/2022,"The Conservative politician accused of watching porn on his phone in the House of Commons has announced he will step down as an MP after facing calls to resign. Neil Parish, the MP for Tiverton and Honiton in Devon, had already had the Tory whip removed and suggested he had opened the porn “in error”. He previously said he would only resign if found guilty by an inquiry into his actions. In an emotional interview with BBC News South West, he said a first incident was accidental as he had been looking at tractors but that a second time was deliberate. “The situation was that – funnily enough it was tractors I was looking at,” he said. “I did get into another website that had a very similar name and I watched it for a bit which I shouldn’t have done. “But my crime – biggest crime – is that on another occasion I went in a second time.” Parish admitted on that occasion it was on purpose and that he watched the porn while sitting and waiting to vote in the Commons chamber. He said: “What I did was absolutely wrong.” He added that he first thought he would explain to the standards committee what had happened, but could see the “furore and the damage I was causing my family and my constituency” and decided to resign. Parish said it was “a moment of madness”, adding: “I was wrong, I was stupid, I lost sense of mind. “I make a full apology. A total full apology. It was not my intention to intimidate.” He denied he viewed the porn on his phone in the hope someone else would be able to see what he was watching. A spokesperson for Tiverton and Honiton Conservatives said: “We would like to take this opportunity to thank Neil Parish for his service to our communities over the past 12 years. We support his decision to step down as our member of parliament.” Parish, the chair of the environment, food and rural affairs select committee, had already had the whip suspended after becoming the fourth MP from his party since the last election to face claims of impropriety. He told the Daily Telegraph it felt “almost as if a weight is lifted off me” when the allegations became public. His wife said in the same interview that she only found out about the incident when a reporter called her asking for a quote.",News/Politics,Tory Neil Parish to resign as MP over Commons porn allegations,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/30/tory-neil-parish-resigns-mp-commons-porn-allegations
4/30/2022,"Born in Nevada in 1981, Jenny Lee Lindberg is a founding member of LA-based indie-rock quartet Warpaint. As a bass player and vocalist, she has recorded three albums with the band including 2014’s Warpaint, which made the top 10 in the UK charts. In 2015, Lindberg released her first solo album, Right On!, under the name Jennylee, with a follow-up single last October. Warpaint’s fourth album, Radiant Like This, is out on Friday,6 May and the band kick off a six-date UK tour at the O2 Academy Bristol on 11 May. The Batman (Dir Matt Reeves, 2022) I hadn’t been to the movies in a very long time, so I went and saw The Batman by myself in a really comfy theatre. I love DC and Marvel movies a lot, always have, and watching this was a very childlike experience. My eyes were popping out of my head. It feels a lot more realistic than the other Batman films and not very superhero-y. Robert Pattinson is great as Batman and Zoë Kravitz is wonderful as Catwoman. They’ve got great chemistry. Life Below Zero (National Geographic) This show brings me a lot of joy and peace. It’s about people who live off-grid in Alaska. They hunt their own food, cut wood to heat their homes and fetch their own water. They’re just working non-stop, harder than most people work in their lives. I would never be able to do it – I’ve never even gone camping alone before – but it’s a super-inspiring show and it relieves my anxiety somehow. I admire every single person on the show and how self-sufficient they are. They’re total badass. Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss My friend gave me this book not long ago and I’m reading it now. It was written in the 1980s by a psychiatrist who is also a hypnotherapist. In the book, he’s trying to help a patient who has terrible dreams and crazy anxiety. Within the hypnotherapy sessions, she starts revealing past lives in lots of detail. It’s really intriguing. I’m a spiritual person but I also believe in science. I was raised Christian but I lost a bit of faith that there is anything beyond this life. This book has reignited some of that faith. Crown Solitaire I’ve been playing this game for a while. It’s a slightly different version of classic solitaire – there are seven rows and all the cards are face-up at the start – and it’s a little more fun. I play it a lot when we’re travelling. It’s really calming and cathartic and I’m using my brain a bit – there are strategies involved. It’s handy when I’m trying to take a break from social media. If I have a little tic and want to pick up my phone, I play this instead. Utah I moved to Utah in December 2019 and I’m in love with it. I live in Salt Lake City with my boyfriend, who’s from here. It’s the most beautiful place I’ve lived in. The pace is really calm but there’s still a lot of culture. There are tons of hikes and I’ve started snowboarding – it’s got some of the best snow on Earth. I feel like I’m more at one with nature than I have been in a long time. Salt Lake City is surprisingly progressive – there’s a big gay community here – and there are lots of good restaurants. I love it. Homemade pizza using Ooni Karu 12 My boyfriend and I got a home pizza oven during the pandemic – an Ooni Karu 12 multifuel oven – and we’ve been making our own pizzas in the back yard. It’s crazy how much better the pizza tastes at home, even though we don’t really know what we’re doing. It’s done in three minutes or less and you put anything you want on it – my favourite has broccoli, olives, red onions, jalapeño, cheese and artichoke hearts. I’m not quite sure why the taste is so different but it’s 10,000 times better than parlour pizza.",Arts/Culture,On my radar: Jenny Lee Lindberg’s cultural highlights,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/apr/30/on-my-radar-jenny-lee-lindbergs-cultural-highlights
4/30/2022,"Nurseries across the UK are being forced to close or reduce their services at an alarming rate because they are struggling to recruit and retain staff, the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) has warned. The crisis is only set to deepen as more childcare providers go out of business, increasing demand for places and pushing prices even higher for families struggling with the rising cost of living. Purnima Tanuku, the chief executive of the NDNA, said: “Until recently, government underfunding was the main reason nurseries were going out of business, but now we are seeing more nurseries unable to open because they can’t employ sufficient staff,” she said. “Every closure is devastating to local communities, parents and children. They must not lose out because the government has failed to invest in our early years workforce.” Her comments follow broad criticism from the sector at the suggestion by the government that nurseries in England could take in more toddlers without employing extra staff. At a cabinet meeting on reducing living costs last week, Boris Johnson raised reviewing nursery ratios of staff to children – a proposal that has been branded “ludicrous” and “insulting” by early years providers. Tanuku said the PM’s plans were likely to cause more qualified staff to quit the sector. “The suggestion the best way to help families with costs is to tinker with ratios is shortsighted. It will put more pressure on the workforce and place children at risk.” About 95% of nurseries say the government’s funding does not cover their costs and 85% are operating at a loss or breaking even, says the NDNA. Now the recruitment crisis has reached a level that is forcing many nurseries to reduce their intake. Sam Sims, the manager at Rydal Day Nursery in north Somerset, was forced to close the nursery’s baby room in March for the first time leaving 23 families without childcare. She said: “We used to have a lot of applicants when we advertised but nowadays we can’t attract the staff and those with the right qualifications aren’t coming through. The funding for early years doesn’t cover staff wages so nurseries across the sector can’t afford to pay more than the minimum wage.” Asked what she would like to see from the government, she replied: “A huge recruitment drive, acknowledgment of the importance of early years and more funding.” Lisa Dobbs is an NDNA network chair based in Wales and runs the Bridgend College Day nursery. She said: “At our network meetings the top concern is recruitment. “Some smaller nurseries have had to reduce their opening hours and one well respected nursery with 46 places has closed in our area due to financial and staffing pressures. Sadly a lot of really experienced practitioners are leaving the profession.” The latest government figures show in England there was a decline of more than 300 nurseries between July 2020 and July 2021. In Scotland, Sharon Fairley, nursery owner and CEO of the Scottish Private Nursery Association, told the Observer that its members “cannot attract professionals to work within the sector”. In addition, people are quitting the profession for better paid jobs as a low unemployment rate means it is a job seekers’ market. Fairley, the director of four nurseries in Edinburgh and West Lothian, said: “We have space for more children to meet the demand from working parents but we cannot guarantee the staff to meet the required ratios.” June O’Sullivan is the chief executive of London Early Years Foundation (LEYF) – a social enterprise operating 39 nurseries in some of the capital’s most deprived areas. She said: “If you are thinking how to retain an already shrinking workforce, easing nurseries’ staffing ratios could be the death knell for so many people. Staff already feel undervalued and the existing funding is insufficient without that extra pressure. “The recruitment crisis is the worst it has ever been. The pool of qualified level-three staff – the bread and butter staff – has really shrunk.” The organisation has shed a lot of staff across central London as people have been driven out by the high cost of travel and rent, she said. And previously 15% of its staff were European but many have now left the UK. Nicole Politis, who runs Portico Day Nurseries, has been trying to recruit staff for six vacancies in St Helens and Lancashire but has only managed to interview one person in three weeks. She said: “We are getting no interest. It’s never been this hard to attract people.” She says many nurseries are struggling amid rising energy bills and business rates. And while they have a waiting list at three of their nurseries they can’t take on more children due to lack of staff. “This could put our free funded places under threat and unfortunately it will be children from low income families that suffer,” she said. Official data from Ofsted shows nurseries are closing at a higher rate in poor and disadvantaged neighbourhoods. The children’s minister, Will Quince, has said he will not compromise on safety and quality in striving to deliver value for money for parents and the taxpayer. A spokesperson said the government was increasing the hourly rates that childcare providers receive and had already announced up to £180m to provide better training and support for staff working with preschool children. “We are aware of concerns about workforce recruitment and retention and are working with the sector to look further at how we can support providers in this area. “Ministers are looking at all options to support parents with availability and costs of childcare. Any significant change to regulations would be subject to consultation.”",News/Education,UK faces childcare crisis as staff shortages force nurseries to close,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/30/uk-faces-childcare-crisis-as-staff-shortages-force-nurseries-to-close
4/30/2022,"The title of the second Downton Abbey movie promises a new era, but in fact this is a reheated serving of reassuringly familiar comfort food for fans of the series. The same crusty class certainties under the same cold, Wedgewood-blue skies; the same light sprinkling of xenophobia and the same eager score that bustles in between lines of dialogue like an over-solicitous waiter. The story takes up where the last picture, already something of a redundant postscript to the television series, left off: widower Tom Branson (Allen Leech) marries Lucy Smith (Tuppence Middleton). But the Crawley family is soon shaken by two events. First, fearsome matriarch Violet Crawley (Maggie Smith), whose bon mots are now a little bon moth-eaten but who remains one of the more entertaining characters, reveals that she has acquired a French villa. Second, a film crew invades Downton, causing much kerfuffle, but paying handsomely. In the collision between aristocracy and the world of entertainment, writer Julian Fellowes pays loving tribute to himself and his breakthrough film, Gosford Park. But a plot device that hinges on the transition between the silent movie era and the talkies is lifted rather more obviously from Singin’ in the Rain. It’s a comparison that does this artless cash-in no favours.",Arts/Film,Downton Abbey: A New Era review – an artless cash-in with the Crawleys,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/30/downton-abbey-a-new-era-review-an-artless-cash-in-with-the-crawleys
4/30/2022,"Lawyers for voters seeking to bar the far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene from Congress over her support for the January 6 insurrection have accused her of lying in a hearing in the case. In a filing Friday, lawyers for groups challenging Greene said a text from the Georgia congresswoman to then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, released by the House committee investigating January 6, shows she lied in testimony. At the hearing in Atlanta earlier this month, a fractious affair in front of an administrative judge, Greene said she could not recall advocating for Donald Trump to impose martial law after the Capitol attack, as the then president sought to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election to Joe Biden. In the text message released this week, Greene told Meadows on 17 January 2021, 11 days after the riot and three days before Biden’s inauguration: “In our private chat with only Members several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call Marshall [sic] law. “I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next.” As reported by Bloomberg News, attorneys for Greene’s challengers said: “Greene’s testimony at the hearing that she could not remember discussing martial law with anyone was already dubious. “This text with President Trump’s chief of staff makes her testimony even more incredible because it seems like the kind of message with the kind of recipient that a reasonable person testifying truthfully would remember.” Greene’s lawyer, James Bopp Jr, told Bloomberg: “The text very clearly said she doesn’t know about those things. It couldn’t be clearer. “It’s just another outrageous fabrication that we have been seeing from the other side throughout this case, because they don’t have the law on their side.” The attempt to push Greene off the ballot in the Republican primary is based on section three of the 14th amendment to the US constitution. Ratified in 1868, shortly after the civil war, the amendment bars from office anyone who has taken an oath under the constitution but then engaged in insurrection. A bipartisan Senate committee linked seven deaths to the Capitol attack, which occurred after Trump told supporters to “fight like hell” in service of his lies about electoral fraud. Riot participants have tied Greene to their cause. She has repeated Trump’s lie that the election was stolen but also denied links to rioters and said she was not calling for political violence when she backed Trump’s claims. In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol riot, Greene was one of 147 Republicans in the House and Senate who objected to electoral college results. The groups challenging Greene have challenged other Trump supporters. An effort to exclude Madison Cawthorn, from North Carolina, failed when a judge said an 1872 civil war amnesty law was not merely retroactive. Attempts to eject two Arizonans, Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs, were also rejected. The judge in Greene’s case has said he will soon make a recommendation to Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, who will then rule. Raffensperger is a conservative Republican but also the official who blocked Trump’s attempt to overturn his defeat in Georgia. Raffensperger has said that caused him to fear for his safety. Greene appears in This Will Not Pass, a hotly anticipated new book by two New York Times reporters, both in her relation to the January 6 attack and as a thorn in the side of congressional Democrats. “If there was one Republican who had shown she had no business serving in Congress,” Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns write, “Democrats believed it was” Greene. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, though, “thought it would be pointless to try expelling Greene from the House. Even if an expulsion vote succeeded, the speaker believed Greene would easily win a special election in her district and return.”",News/US news,Marjorie Taylor Greene accused of lying in hearing in Capitol attack case,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/30/marjorie-taylor-greene-accused-lying-capitol-attack-case
4/30/2022,"It is not so long ago that Jürgen Klopp allowed Eddie Howe access all areas at Anfield as he permitted a then out-of-work colleague to shadow virtually his every move. Liverpool’s manager had perhaps not bargained for Howe subsequently poaching one of his key analysts, Mark Leyland, as soon as he took charge of Newcastle – or breathing so much new life into Steve Bruce’s old side that this lunchtime kick-off in the Tyneside sunshine represented an unexpected threat to the Merseysiders’ title chances. In reality it was not quite as tight as the scoreline might suggest, but a refreshed Liverpool XI, watched by the initially benched Mo Salah and Thiago Alcântara, were still made to work hard for a win which not only maintains the pressure on Manchester City but ended Newcastle’s record-equalling run of six straight home victories. James Milner marked a rare start, and a latest return to a former club, by creating the opening goal for the impressive Naby Keïta after emerging from a 50/50 challenge with Fabian Schär having won the ball. The pair’s collision left Newcastle’s centre-half lying on the turf for several minutes, which was far from ideal from Howe’s viewpoint. How he could have done with Schär on his feet as Keïta subsequently dribbled his way around Martin Dubravka before shooting through a hastily constructed, distinctly ersatz, wall of Newcastle defenders. As Klopp punched thin air with glee, Howe looked distinctly unimpressed. Along with the majority of the 52,000-plus crowd packed inside St James’ Park, he appeared convinced Andre Marriner had been wrong to wave play on in the wake of Milner’s tackle. With a VAR review deciding otherwise, the goal stood and Schär eventually limped back into the heart of the home defence. Tellingly, as his Liverpool teammates celebrated and Newcastle’s physiotherapists waited to come on, Virgil van Dijk had earlier gone straight to his stricken opponent to check he was not badly hurt. After spending so long sidelined by a serious knee injury, Klopp’s towering centre half evidently has reordered priorities these days. Although Miguel Almirón briefly thought he had equalised after rounding Alisson, the Paraguayan forward’s effort was rightly chalked off for offside. As hard, albeit forlornly, as Almirón and Allan Saint-Maximin strived and as accomplished as many of Bruno Guimarães’s midfield touches – including a memorable nutmegging of Milner – were, Liverpool had by now assumed a large measure of control, enjoying more than 70 per cent of the possession. Jordan Henderson was heavily involved in this monopolisation of the ball, with the former Sunderland midfielder apparently inspired by the wholesale booing which greeted his every touch. Indeed Henderson very nearly created a goal for Diogo Jota before half time courtesy of a fine cross. That manoeuvre concluded with Dúbravka performing acrobatic wonders to somehow tip Jota’s flicked, high-velocity header to safety. If Henderson had succeeded in upstaging Jonjo Shelvey, another midfield duel, this time involving Keïta and Joe Willock, was also going the Liverpool man’s way, leaving Willock exerting marginal impact on proceedings. With the scars of that clash with Milner leaving Schär often similarly ineffective, it was no surprise when Howe replaced him with Jamaal Lascelles. The Newcastle captain hardly had time to settle in before Sadio Mané had Klopp cursing after meeting Joe Gomez’s delivery from the right before sending his shot whizzing narrowly, and wastefully, wide. It proved the cue for Howe to replace Willock with Chris Wood and, very shortly afterwards, Klopp to swap Mane and Henderson for Salah and Fabinho. Salah’s wonderfully intelligent movement soon had Dan Burn and Lascelles on edge. Not that they were quite as nervous as Klopp when Saint-Maximin played in Wood only for the New Zealander to shoot straight at Alisson. It initially seemed a very big miss so it was probably just as well for Wood that a linesman’s offside flag indicated that any goal would not have counted. Even so, Klopp felt it necessary to introduce Thiago to the occasion. All that remained was for Dubravka to once again excel in keeping a Jota shot out. Howe and Klopp maintained a frosty distance at the final whistle as Liverpool continued to breathe down Manchester City’s neck.",Sport/Football,Naby Keïta downs Newcastle as Liverpool up tempo in title race,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/30/newcastle-liverpool-premier-league-match-report
4/30/2022,"An inmate in Colorado has become the first human in the US to test positive for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, amid the worst outbreak of the virus in seven years and a cull of millions of poultry in dozens of states. The unnamed prisoner contracted the infection during a work release assignment at a farm in Montrose county where workers were euthanising an infected flock, the Colorado department of public health and environment said. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the health risk to the general public remained low. “The patient reported fatigue for a few days as their only symptom and has since recovered,” the agency said, adding that the man, who was younger than 40, was treated with the antiviral drug oseltamivir. The Colorado case “does not change the human health risk assessment”, the CDC said. “[The agency] has tracked the health of more than 2,500 people with exposures to H5N1 virus-infected birds and this is the only case that has been found to date. Other people involved in the culling operation in Colorado have tested negative for H5 virus infection, but they are being retested out of an abundance of caution.” The only other known human case of the strain of bird flu currently predominant was in the UK in December last year, the CDC noted, although almost 900 cases have been reported worldwide from earlier H5N1 viruses since 2003. The US agriculture department has been tracking the spread of avian influenza across 30 states and affecting more than 35 million birds, according to its latest figures. The Guardian reported on Thursday that more than 22 million birds have been killed in an attempt to contain the outbreak, the majority in Iowa, the biggest US producer of eggs. That figure didn’t include a commercial egg farm in Knox, Nebraska where 2.1 million poultry were reported affected on Wednesday. At one egg factory in Rembrandt, Iowa, about 250 employees were fired after roasting alive 5.3 million chickens, the largest cull at any factory farm in the country, in circumstances some fired workers and animal rights groups say were inhumane. The Storm Lake Times revealed that birds at Rembrandt were culled using a system known as ventilation shutdown plus (VSD+) in which air is closed off to the barns and heat pumped in until the temperature rises above 104F (40C). “They cooked those birds alive,” said one of the workers involved. Earlier in the week, an H3N8 strain of bird flu was detected in humans for the first time in Henan province in China. The four-year-old boy infected had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home, according to reports from China’s National Health Commission. Avian influenza, or bird flu, is a highly contagious viral disease. The first reports of human cases came in the 1990s. Some strains have been passed to humans but it is currently very rare and usually occurs only after very close contact with infected birds or animals.",News/US news,Colorado inmate becomes first person in US to test positive for bird flu,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/30/us-bird-flu-case-h5n1-colorado
