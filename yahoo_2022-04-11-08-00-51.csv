In March, the market’s preferred ISM Non-Manufacturing PMI increased from 56.5 to 58.3. With the stats dollar positive, the FOMC meeting minutes were also dollar positive mid-week. More hawkish than anticipated minutes drove U.S Treasury yields northwards. The minutes revealed plans to begin cutting the FED balance sheet by $95bn per month amidst a rising interest rate environment to curb inflation.

The Index fell by 6.8% in the previous week. The Refinance Index slid by 10% and was 62% lower than the same week one year ago. In the week prior, the Index tumbled by 15%. The refinance share of mortgage activity decreased from 40.6% to 38.8% of total applications. In the previous week, the share fell from 44.8% to 40.6%. According to the MBA, Mortgage application volume continues to fall due to the upswing in mortgage rates, driven by sentiment towards monetary policy. As higher rates reduce the incentive to refinance, application volume fell to its lowest since Spring 2019. Strong labor market conditions and wage growth have supported housing demand despite surging mortgage rates and house price appreciation. Inventories continue to peg back purchase activity, however. The week kicks off with inflation figures due out on Tuesday. Expect plenty of market sensitivity to the numbers following last week’s hawkish FOMC meeting minutes. On Wednesday, wholesale inflation figures will also draw interest ahead. Away from the economic data, Russia and Ukraine will remain an area of focus for the global financial markets.
