1/20/2022,"Novak Djokovic could be deported from Australia because it was “plainly open” to the immigration minister to conclude the world No 1 tennis star was opposed to vaccination, the full federal court has said. Chief justice James Allsop on Thursday delivered the court’s reasons for rejecting Djokovic’s challenge to his visa cancellation. The court found it was reasonable that his presence “may encourage rallies and protests that may lead to heightened community transmission”.  The decision resulted in Djokovic’s deportation just a day before the scheduled start of his Australian Open title defence. The Australian immigration minister, Alex Hawke, had cancelled Djokovic’s visa on the basis his presence in Australia might risk “civil unrest” as he was a “talisman of anti-vaccination sentiment”. Djokovic’s lawyers disputed claims the tennis star was an anti-vaxxer, arguing that was based on one statement in April 2020 “well before Covid vaccines were available” and that Hawke had failed to ask the tennis player his views. The judges noted that in order to deport Djokovic the minister only had to be “satisfied that his presence is, or may be, or would, or might be … a risk”. To win, Djokovic would have had to have shown the minister could not have been satisfied “logically or rationally on the available material”. The judges concluded that it was open to Hawke to find that “Djokovic had a stance that was well-known on vaccination and that he was opposed to it” on the basis of the April 2020 news article. In that interview, Djokovic reportedly said he was “opposed to vaccination” although he had qualified this by saying that he was “no expert” and “would keep an open mind”. “Further, there was no issue that Mr Djokovic was not, by January 2022, vaccinated,” the judge said in their reasons, meaning it was “plainly open” for Hawke to infer “he was opposed to vaccination or did not wish to be”. The full court noted that Hawke was satisfied that Djokovic’s stance could encourage anti-vaccination groups and found the evidence supported “an affinity of these groups with his views”. “It was not irrational for the minister to be concerned that the asserted support of some anti-vaccination groups for Mr Djokovic’s apparent position on vaccination may encourage rallies and protests that may lead to heightened community transmission.” They also accepted that people “simply uncertain or wavering as to whether they will be vaccinated” might be influenced because “an iconic world tennis star may influence people of all ages, young or old, but perhaps especially the young and the impressionable, to emulate him”. The judges noted that there was evidence “Djokovic had recently disregarded reasonable public health measures overseas by attending activities unmasked while Covid positive to his knowledge”. Djokovic had admitted to attending events after testing positive to Covid-19 on 16 December, including knowingly attending a media interview and photoshoot on 18 December after he had been notified of the results. Djokovic’s lawyers argued Hawke failed to consider the impact on anti-vaccination sentiment if he were deported, but the judges concluded it was not necessary for him to do so. They also found Hawke “was aware of any number of different consequences that might ensue if the visa were cancelled” and had not ignored adverse consequences. Djokovic was taken into immigration detention after his visa was cancelled on 6 January, before it was restored by the federal circuit court on 10 January. On Thursday, The Sun reported that Djokovic was considering suing the Australian government over his detention, arguing it amounted to ill-treatment. Djokovic’s mother claims he was “subjected to torture, to harassment”, an apparent reference to the conditions at the Park hotel in Melbourne where he was kept with refugees and asylum seekers, who had reported finding maggots in their food in December. Hawke exercised a personal power to re-cancel Djokovic’s visa sparking the federal court case, which upheld the cancellation and resulted in his deportation the evening before the start of the Australian Open on Monday.",Sport/Sport,‘Plainly open’ to Australian immigration minister to conclude Novak Djokovic was an anti-vaxxer: judges,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/20/australian-immigration-minister-open-to-conclude-novak-djokovic-was-an-anti-vaxxer-judges
1/20/2022,"Even in a normal Sundance year, as Hollywood wraps up and heads to the mountains, it’s difficult to predict what will and won’t hit. What might look promising on paper too often tanks on screen while, time and time again, the smaller, less obvious titles resonate instead.  What was set to be a hybrid physical-digital edition (after last year’s digital only fest) has now become online only, an inevitable downgrade after the rise of Omicron. It’s another low-key line-up surrounded by question marks, but here are the films to look out for: Ever since the end of her landmark HBO show Girls, there has been a slight awkwardness to Lena Dunham’s creative output – from the ill-advised remake of Camping (Jennifer Garner is no Vicki Pepperdine) to her involvement with the one season, one star nightmare of Generation. But there’s every reason to be excited about Sharp Stick, her first film as director in over a decade. Despite a patchy final season, Girls remains something of a masterwork and her new film – about an affair between a babysitter and her employer – promises something interestingly knotty and exploratory. Dunham was inspired by female-led 70s dramas such as An Unmarried Woman and A Woman Under the Influence and stars in the film herself, alongside Jon Bernthal, Zola breakout Taylour Paige and Kristine Froseth. This year’s festival has a number of genre titles that deal with racial dynamics (Nikyatu Jusu’s Nanny posits a Senegalese woman in a tense, potentially supernatural scenario with her white employers while Tarantino mentee Krystin Ver Linden’s Alice shifts from slavery drama to blaxploitation thriller) but none sound quite as tantalizing as Mariama Diallo’s debut thriller, Master. More specific plot details are being kept understandably under wraps but we know that it follows three women at an elite university, built on the site of Salem-era gallows, battling discrimination as well as something even more horrifying. Regina Hall, an actor finally and deservedly getting her due, stars. While the film surrounding her didn’t quite live up to her performance, Emma Thompson’s Sundance crowd-pleaser Late Night was at least a welcome reminder of the actor’s substantial comic prowess. She returns this year with Good Luck to You, Leo Grande, starring as a retired teacher who feels like her sex life has never been quite as exciting as it should have been. To fix this, she hires a sex worker. Director Sophie Hyde was last at the festival with her wonderful, criminally underseen gem Animals, and will undoubtedly be a similarly sure hand here, working with a script from comedian Katy Brand. The crushing weight of what “America’s dad” Bill Cosby has been accused of by multiple women is the focus of W Kamau Bell’s damning four-part documentary, We Need to Talk About Cosby. In the series, Bell talks to survivors but also speaks to others who comment on not only the cultural impact of having to redefine someone from hero to villain but also the system that allowed for such abuse to go unnoticed for so long. “I never thought I’d ever wrestle with who we all thought Cosby was and who we now understand him to be,” Bell said of the project. “I’m not sure he would want me to do this work, but Cliff Huxtable definitely would.” While the Star Wars franchise undoubtedly squandered John Boyega by the end, the British actor’s movie star charisma was one of the trilogy’s most exciting reveals. After an award-winning turn in Steve McQueen’s Small Axe, he’s aiming for more trophies with fact-based drama 892. Based on a 2018 article, the contained drama will see Boyega star as a haunted veteran struggling to deal with normal life who decides to rob a bank. The script is from award-winning playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah while Boyega’s supporting cast features Nicole Beharie, the under-utilized star of Miss Juneteenth, Connie Britton and Michael K Williams in his final screen role. After the success of Get Out, a buzzy Sundance premiere back in 2017, the term “social thriller” has surged in popularity among industry types, linked to everything from Tyrel to Us to Luce to Promising Young Woman, used to describe genre films that speak to deeper issues and the specific time of creation. In Mimi Cave’s directorial debut Fresh, it has been used to describe the story of a woman, played by Normal People’s Daisy Edgar-Jones, whose boredom of dating apps leads her to take a chance on a stranger, played by Sebastian Stan, who hides a dark secret. The film boasts Adam McKay, fresh off Netflix hit Don’t Look Up, as producer and has already been bought pre-fest by Searchlight. While it’s sadly never not a topical time for a film about the restrictive nature of abortion access in the US, 2022 makes for a particularly troubling period and so this year, two particular films will carry an added prescience. Both look at The Jane Collective, an underground service in Chicago that pre-Roe vs Wade, helped women secure safe abortions. Documentary The Janes takes a broader look while Call Jane focuses on a housewife, played by Elizabeth Banks, who joins the group after her pregnancy leads to a condition that the medical system isn’t willing or able to help with. Carol screenwriter Phillis Nagy directs while Sigourney Weaver and Kate Mara co-star. One of the most anticipated documentaries of the festival zeroes in on one of the most difficult subjects imaginable: Kanye West aka Ye. The immensely talented yet forever troubled musician isn’t directly involved with the project but he’s given it his blessing – a sprawling three-film look at an unusual life, two decades in the making. Directors Coodie & Chike started recording West back in the late 90s and have kept their footage private ever since, but now, they’re hoping to show us another side of an artist we think we already know.",Arts/Film,Sundance 2022: films and shows to look out for at this year’s festival,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/19/sundance-2022-films-and-shows-to-look-out-for-at-this-years-festival
1/20/2022,"The former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham told the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack that Donald Trump hosted secret meetings in the White House residence in days before 6 January, according to two sources familiar with the matter. The former senior Trump aide also told House investigators that the details of whether Trump actually intended to march to the Capitol after his speech at the Ellipse rally would be memorialized in documents provided to the US Secret Service, the sources said.  The select committee’s interview with Grisham, who was Melania Trump’s chief of staff when she resigned on 6 January, was more significant than expected, the sources said, giving the panel new details about the Trump White House and what the former US president was doing before the Capitol attack. Grisham gave House investigators an overview of the chaotic final weeks in the Trump White House in the days leading up to the Capitol attack, recalling how the former president held off-the-books meetings in the White House residence, the sources said. The secret meetings were apparently known by only a small number of aides, the sources said. Grisham recounted that they were mostly scheduled by Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and that the former chief usher, Timothy Harleth, would wave participants upstairs, the sources said. Harleth, the former director of rooms at the Trump International Hotel before moving with the Trumps to the White House in 2017, was once one of the former first family’s most trusted employees, according to a top former White House aide to Melania Trump. But after Harleth sought to ingratiate himself with the Biden transition team after Trump’s defeat in the 2020 election in order to keep his White House role, Trump and Meadows moved to fire him before Melania Trump stepped in to keep him until Biden’s inauguration. Grisham told the select committee she was not sure who exactly Trump met with in the White House residence, but provided Harleth’s name and the identities of other Trump aides in the usher’s office who might know of the meetings, the sources said. The Guardian previously reported that Trump made several phone calls from the Yellow Oval Room and elsewhere in the White House residence to lieutenants at the Willard hotel in Washington the night before the Capitol attack, telling them to stop Joe Biden’s certification. Trump increasingly retreated to the White House residence to conduct work as his presidency progressed, according to another former Trump administration official, as he felt less watched by West Wing aides than in the Oval Office. Towards the end of his presidency, the former Trump administration official said, an aide to former White House adviser Peter Navarro tried at least once to quietly usher into the residence Sidney Powell, a lawyer pushing lies about election fraud, to speak with Trump. A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment on Grisham’s interview that took place the first week of January. Harleth did not respond to questions about the meetings in the White House residence when reached last week by phone. Over the course of her hours-long interview, Grisham told House investigators that the mystery surrounding Trump’s promise at the Ellipse rally that he would march with his supporters to the Capitol might be resolved in Trump White House documents, the sources said. The former president’s purported intention to go to the Capitol has emerged as a crucial issue for the select committee, as they examine whether Trump oversaw a criminal conspiracy coordinating his political plan to stop Biden’s certification with the insurrection. Trump’s promise is significant as it served as one of the primary motivations for his supporters to march to the Capitol alongside militia groups like the Oath Keepers, and was used by far-right activists like Alex Jones to encourage the crowd along the route. But Trump never went to the Capitol and instead returned to the White House, where he watched the attack unfold on television – after being informed by the Secret Service before the insurrection that they could not guarantee his security if he marched to the Capitol. The select committee is now trying to untangle whether Trump made a promise that he perhaps had no intention of honoring because he hoped to incite an insurrection that stopped the certification – his only remaining play to get a second term – one of the sources said. Grisham told the select committee that Trump’s intentions – and whether the Secret Service had been told Trump had decided not to march to the Capitol – should be reflected in the presidential line-by-line, the document that outlines the president’s movements, the sources said. The chairman of the select committee, Bennie Thompson, has told reporters the panel is already seeking information from the Secret Service about what plans they had for Trump on January 6, as well as what evacuation strategies they had for then-vice president Mike Pence. But the presidential line-by-line, which gets sent to the Secret Service, could also reveal discussions about security concerns and suggest a new line of inquiry into why an assessment about conditions that were too dangerous for the president were not disseminated further. Grisham also told the select committee about the necessary coordination between the Trump White House, the Secret Service and organizers of the “Save America” rally at the Ellipse on 6 January in order to ensure Trump’s appearance, the sources said. The former Trump aide suggested to the select committee that Trump was determined to speak at the rally once he heard about its existence, the sources said, and was constantly on the phone to oversee the event’s optics, the sources said.",News/US news,"Trump held secret meetings in days before Capitol attack, ex-press secretary tells panel ",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/trump-secret-meetings-january-6-capitol-attack-stephanie-grisham
1/20/2022,"The recent change in travel advice allowing UK citizens to travel to France again has put the country back on the agenda for the ski season. While skiers scramble to secure packages to the famous mega-resorts, there are dozens of smaller, lesser-known ski villages that offer excellent value for money while combining thrilling skiing with old-time charm and glorious natural surroundings. Here are a few that offer a change of scene and pace.  You would hardly know this traditional farming village, tightly clustered around a tall baroque church spire, was a ski resort. There are no big hotels or pylons, but one chairlift discreetly rises from the back of the village, connecting to the Espace Diamant, a surprisingly large ski area given its low profile, with 192km of runs across six resort villages. Lying at 1,150 metres in the Beaufortain region with epic views of Mont Blanc, Hauteluce has an “eco museum” displaying historic objects from everyday life. Nearby is the smart La Ferme du Chozal hotel (doubles from €175 a night room-only, six-person apartments from €1,600 per week) with spa and restaurant. The traditional Alpine town of Valloire is famous as a point on the classic Tour de France route between the Col du Télégraphe and the Col du Galibier – one of the highest passes in the cycle race. It’s less well known as a ski resort, but the sport has grown a lot here over the years and benefits from a link to the modern resort of Valmeinier, together creating a varied ski area of 150km of pistes across the Maurienne valley. The Résidence Odalys le Hameau (from €405 per week sleeping four), just 10 metres from the slopes, has simple self-catering apartments and an indoor pool. Many smaller ski resorts lie at a lower altitude than the big hitters, but not so Saint-Véran in the unspoilt Queyras valley, which sits at 2,040 metres and stakes a claim to be the highest (and, they say, the most beautiful) resort village in France. Situated in glorious Queyras regional natural park and known primarily as a place for enthusiastic ski tourers to get into the backcountry, it also has a small network of lifts for downhill skiers. Try the Chalets du Villard, whose rooms and separate gîtes have access to a sauna and restaurant (studio rooms from €102 per night sleeping two or €160 sleeping four, room only; gîtes from €465 per week sleeping four). Among 40 ski resorts across the French Pyrenées, the high mountain town of Barèges is an excellent choice, noted for its thermal waters and proximity to the Grand Tourmalet ski area, the region’s largest, which also incorporates La Mongie. Freeriding on the 2,877-metre Pic du Midi, with 10km of descent, is a big draw, though it’s almost as fun to ride the cable car up to the top just for a cappuccino on the sun terrace. Balneotherapy centres provide relaxing immersion in the famous waters, while kids might prefer an igloo-building lesson. The recently revamped 13-room Hotel le Central (doubles from €75 a night, room only) has a pool and handy in-house ski hire and servicing. A good all-round resort for a variety of snow-bound activities, Pays de Gex connects four characterful ski areas in the Monts Jura mountain range, 30 minutes’ drive from Geneva and covered under one ski pass costing a bargainous £19 a day. There’s great diversity among them: challenging Lélex-Crozet has a vertical drop of 800 metres, Mijoux-La Faucille offers dreamy cruising, Menthières has family runs, while 160km of cross-country tracks wind through the Domaine de la Vattay. Be sure to try bleu de Gex-Haut Jura, the local blue cheese. And consider Hôtel-Restaurant Bois Joly in Crozet, with magnificent balcony views and serving traditional fare featuring morilles, marrons and escargots.A seven-night stay costs from £506 for two people room only, booking.com The Aravis valley resorts of La Clusaz, Manigod, Saint-Jean-de-Sixt and Le Grand-Bornand are a serious option for skiers of all levels, linked by ski bus, with 230km of varied runs between them. La Clusaz is a good all-rounder with some gnarly off-piste on the Massif de Balme. Manigod’s woodland learner slopes are lovely for first-timers, while Le Grand-Bornand suits intermediates, with some black runs. The area excels when it comes to unusual extracurricular activities, too, such as a 7km night-time sledge run by torchlight or twilight fat-tyred e-bike descent in Le Grand-Bornand. All are easy to reach from Aravis Lodge (three nights’ half-board from £429pp, skiweekender.com), a chalet-hotel with sauna which runs a free shuttle bus. This snow-sure resort on the French-Italian border lies at one end of the Milky Way ski area, where its own 60km of slopes are extended to 400km under the Grand Montgenèvre ski pass, which also covers the Italian resorts of Pragelato, Sestriere, Cesana, Sansicario and Sauze d’Oulx; the two countries’ cultures mix here. Montgenèvre has two boardercross courses, and some folk make day trips to the extreme off-piste resort of La Grave an hour away. Try Le Napoleon’s modern collection of self-catering apartments, with shared access to an indoor pool, hammam and sauna.A seven-night self-drive package costs from £420pp including Eurotunnel crossing with Ski Solutions Increasing numbers of skiing families are cottoning on to Sainte Foy, north of the Tarentaise’s Vanoise national park, as a fantastic alternative to its lively neighbours of Vald’Isère and Tignes. Gorgeous cruisy runs funnel down into the valley, making it hard to get lost, while experienced riders and skiers can discover awesome off-piste lines in the backcountry by hiring a guide when conditions are right.Peak Retreats has seven-nights’ self-catering at the centrally located Etoile des Cimes Sainte Foy Ski Apartments (from £656pp per week including Eurotunnel crossing), which has an indoor pool and spa One of the lesser-known resorts among 110 that are spread through the Savoie Mont Blanc region, Pralognan-la-Vanoise is only one valley over from Courchevel but a world away in terms of cost and atmosphere. This underappreciated gem in the Parc de la Vanoise combines decent downhill (10 reds, four blacks, 10 greens, five blues) with beautiful terrain for snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. One of France’s few curling rinks is open for visitors here, or try cold Toumo yoga, which originated in Tibet and is performed outdoors in the snow and glacial rivers. Hotel Edelweiss, with spa, sauna and gym, became the resort’s first four-star this season (from €980 per week B&B sleeping two, five course dinner €35pp). Or self-cater in an apartment at Les Hauts de la Vanoise (from £500 per week sleeping four). For those whose idea of a winter break involves lots of cosy time padding around a timber cabin watching snowflakes, rather than hammering the sort of pistes you see on Ski Sunday, this might be the one. A 10-minute drive from Gérardmer, whose ski area has 21 runs, night skiing and 30km of cross-country ski trails, is Vosges Cabin, a modern minimalist refuge in a nature reserve in the Vosges mountains. The owner describes the area as more akin to Germany’s Black Forest than the Alps, and the cabin features huge box windows for gazing out at woodland and sparkling Lac du Gérardmer, as well as a hot tub and sauna.Sleeps up to 16 in five en suite bedrooms and a bunk room, from €200-€450 a night depending on numbers, welcomebeyond.com ",Lifestyle/Travel,Fresh powder: the best French ski resorts you’ve never heard of,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/jan/20/fresh-powder-the-best-french-ski-resorts-youve-never-heard-of
1/20/2022,"It wasn’t until my elder daughter applied for university that I became aware of personal statements – 4,000 words with which the applicant can persuade the seat of learning that they are made of the right stuff. I sought guidance from an old friend whom I happened to be catching up with, an eminent lawyer with several university-educated children. Are these statement things important, I asked. “Yes, they are,” he harrumphed. “Certainly far too important to leave to some daft 18-year-old to write.” At around the same time, I was assured by an admissions tutor at a Russell Group university that these statements were hardly ever read; they just looked at the predicted grades.  So, take your pick. My offer of assistance with my daughter’s offering was rejected in the strongest terms with the kind of industrial language I hoped she would not use in the statement itself. Lee Elliot Major, Britain’s first professor of social mobility, said this week that personal statements have become “a systematic disadvantage to poorer students”, as it’s the middle-class applicants getting all the help. He is quite right, of course. But that problem takes root at a much younger age. A friend was the deputy head of an elite girls’ private school in London, with responsibility for admissions. I asked her what on earth she asked 11-year-olds. To her despair, most of them seemed to have memorised a script prepared by their parents. “There was stuff about geopolitics I really couldn’t follow. One girl told me what kind of hedge fund she wanted to run,” my friend wailed. She said the best answer she ever got to the question: “Why do you want come to this school?” came from a girl who said: “It’s on the Piccadilly line.” This would be my advice, certainly: keep these things simple.

1/20/2022,"An extraordinary battle pitting New York multimillionaires against their billionaire neighbours is expected to reach fever pitch on Thursday when local politicians in the Hamptons vote on proposals to close an airport in the super-rich enclave. The East Hampton town board is expected to vote in favour of a plan to “deactivate” the local airport that buzzes with helicopters and private jets ferrying the uber-wealthy from Manhattan to their luxury beach houses.  Residents who are wealthy enough to live in the Hamptons, but not enough to regularly fly in and out, have fought a months-long battle to close the airport that some claim has become so busy it is “like living near JFK”. On the other side, billionaires who regularly use East Hampton airport have been funding a campaign to keep it open. Flight logs show aircraft belonging to the former Google chair Eric Schmidt, the hedge fund manager and New York Mets owner Steve Cohen, and the New York Patriots and New England Revolution owner Bob Kraft regularly use the airport. The disagreement has been described as “the 2% v the 1%” and “the have-everythings v the have-a-lots”. After months of fiery council debates, the town board has proposed a complicated compromise whereby the airport closes as a Federal Aviation Administration facility on 28 February but reopens a couple of weeks later as a “publicly owned private-use airport”. This would allow the town’s officials to limit traffic and noise. Peter Van Scoyoc, the town’s supervisor, said: “The majority of the public has indicated that allowing the airport to continue operating as it has been is unacceptable, and that traffic volume, noise, environmental and safety concerns must be addressed.” The proposed plan would “provide [the] town with maximum flexibility to enact use restrictions” while retaining the “right to close [the] new airport completely if limits don’t provide needed community relief”, he added. The airport handled 31,464 flights in 2019, the latest year for which figures are available, up from 26,010 in 2015. Flights peaked at 266 a day in August 2019, according to a research paper published by the town. During months of online meetings to discuss the plans, Barry Raebeck, the head of the campaign group Say No to KHTO (East Hampton airport’s code), said: “Somebody who’s flying in in a huge jet, they are so self-important. They look down their nose at the East Hampton town. They just think: ‘We’re so rich and powerful. We can do whatever we want. We’ll hire some lawyers and we’ll just sort this out later.’” Another local resident said: “This airport serves a select few while dumping on the rest of this community. It has become unbearable and unsustainable. From Thursday to Monday we are subjected to an endless line of helicopters dumping on us from morning to night, with the heaviest traffic coming at times when we are trying to enjoy time with our family.” Proponents for keeping the airport open in its current form said people arriving by air spend about $20m (£14.7m) a year in the town.",News/US news,‘So self-important’: Hamptons airport vote pits wealthy against super-rich,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/so-self-important-hamptons-airport-vote-pits-wealthy-against-super-rich
1/20/2022,"In her early years in Whitehall, Liz Truss was known to civil servants as the “human hand grenade”, a nickname for her that Boris Johnson has since adopted. Like many of the memes around Truss, it is one she has embraced with gusto. Those close to the prime minister say it was not always intended as an accolade. “She does tend to blow things up. He used to say anything passed her way needed to be handled with care,” one staffer recalled.  But with Johnson on the verge of blowing up his own premiership, it may be the human hand grenade waiting to pick up the pieces. The foreign secretary, who was an early Johnson loyalist, is the other name mentioned in the same breath as Rishi Sunak in the fight to be Johnson’s successor. Truss, 46, is often described as the party members’ darling, for many months topping ConservativeHome’s poll of members asked for their favourite minister. “The role Liz has always said she wanted is chancellor. I think that could still be where her heart lies, but when she kept topping those polls, it turned her head,” one former aide said. But when it comes to a leadership challenge – rather than their pet favourite – the mood of members seems to change and Truss is suddenly the underdog. In an Opinium poll of Conservative members, Sunak beats his closest rival by 28 points. The stats get even worse when you go to the country: Truss is the 23rd most famous Tory politician, according to YouGov, with Sunak and other potential rivals such as Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove and Sajid Javid all in the top 10. Those close to Truss say none of this will daunt her. “People have underestimated her for her entire political career,” a former aide said. In many ways her strategy has been similar to Johnson’s, who courted sceptical MPs over many months with dinners hosted by Jacob Rees-Mogg. Truss has been hosting social events for MPs that have become known as “fizz with Liz”, though her allies swear she doesn’t use the term herself. Scottish Tories including Douglas Ross, who called for the PM to resign, had drinks with Truss last week. Another group met the foreign secretary on Monday night before she flew to Australia for a tour. Each Monday she holds surgeries in the Commons tea room for MPs to bring their concerns. “She pressed the button on leadership stuff around three months ago,” one MP said. “But the problem is that everyone knows about it now. She went too early.” Sources close to Truss deny her contact with MPs amounts to electioneering. “She has always hosted these meetings, since she was trade secretary, because she values what MPs think. She is more in touch than many.” Many MPs feel she will need a major turn in fortunes to win enough support to make it on to the ballot paper. There are already rumours of a deal between other candidates to keep her out. “I would be very surprised if she would get through,” one minister said. Another colleague added: “MPs base their decision on whether the person will keep them their seat and whether they actually like the candidate. You need at least one of those two. I’m not sure she fits either of those categories for many people.” “The party will not choose Liz,” a Tory adviser said. “She is flag-waving, sure, but she doesn’t have the charisma of Boris. She appeals to the TaxPayers’ Alliance and IEA wing of the party but she has no crossover appeal,” they added in reference to the Institute of Economic Affairs free-market thinktank. Yet many colleagues also dismissed Johnson’s chances of making the ballot paper, such was his unpopularity among them. Like Margaret Thatcher, Truss has an intriguing backstory, unlike Sunak’s Winchester, Oxford, hedge fund trajectory. She grew up in Leeds with leftwing parents, attended a high-achieving comprehensive, and her mother took her on peace marches. At Oxford she chaired the Lib Dems but began to develop a new philosophy – of the need for individuals to keep their own money to ensure personal freedom. That drew her to the Conservatives, she has said. Selected for the plum South West Norfolk seat in 2010, her career in politics almost came to an abrupt end after members found out – and objected to – her affair with the MP Mark Field. “It’s quite a credit that she’s managed to turn that reputation around and become the membership’s darling, but that’s because she gets what’s important to them: pride, optimism, a belief in the power of the individual,” the staffer said. Under David Cameron, her first cabinet post was as environment secretary, leading to her infamous viral speech at the Conservative conference in 2014 – a rage against cheese imports in which she exclaimed: “That is a disgrace!” “I think that did change something for Liz, it actually meant she was one of the first politicians of this generation to spot the potential of social media,” the former adviser said. When she arrived as international trade secretary, staff handed her social media strategies for Twitter and LinkedIn but she told them: “Instagram’s my thing.” She taught aides to use Boomerang, a setting on Instagram to create short clips. In recent years, images of her – in red and blue pantsuits, hair tightly curled, boarding jets, strolling purposefully past famous buildings or driving a tank in Estonia – have been carefully curated. Even a picture of her daughter’s birthday cake carries the caption “You can’t stop progress”. The posts are littered with hashtags such as #freeworld #selfdetermination and #nolimits. Truss’s other moment of political crisis – after her battle in her constituency and awkward cheese speech – followed her appointment by Theresa May as justice secretary during the legal row over the triggering of article 50 and the Daily Mail’s infamous front page declaring three high court judges “enemies of the people”. The story broke when Truss was dining in one of London’s inns of court, surrounded by senior members of the judiciary. “She will not have been lacking in advice. But the statement she came out with was mealy mouthed. And she couldn’t recover from it,” one senior legal figure said. “Theresa came to realise that it was not a wise appointment,” one former cabinet minister said. “She forfeited the confidence of the judiciary.” Within 11 months, Truss had been reshuffled to become chief secretary of the Treasury, ostensibly a demotion, but one which allowed her to set out her stall as a free-market thinker in a number of high-profile speeches. One ally said: “People often say about Liz: ‘I’m not sure what she stands for.’ And that could not be further from the truth; she has set out exactly what she stands for.” “Britain is a nation of Uber-riding, Deliveroo-eating, Airbnb-ing freedom fighters,” she said in one speech, a retort to critics of the gig economy. “And to turbocharge our future we need to champion these values, and let people off the leash by liberating every corner of the economy.” She took swipes at environmental regulation, the banning of plastic straws and cups, with digs at enjoying “the warm glow of wood-burning Goves” when her colleague Michael Gove was at the environment department. In the Treasury she often told colleagues the answer to their problems was not more public spending but freedom for the market. “I aim to be the disrupter in chief; I want to challenge those who aim to block change, stop development and restrict success.” Yet when serious challenge has been made to her low-tax beliefs, Truss has been pragmatic, speaking out in private against Sunak’s national insurance rise in late summer last year but then, once it was policy, declining to join Jacob Rees-Mogg in January urging Sunak to cancel the rise. If the choice does come down to Truss or Sunak, one contrast will be Truss’s closeness and loyalty to Johnson. Asked at Conservative party conference last year to name her favourite foreign secretary from history, Truss did not miss a beat. “Boris Johnson.” On Thursday evening last week, after a brutal day for the prime minister, Truss defended him in the media, saying Tories should support him “100%”. In 2019 she was his first cabinet backer. Before that, Johnson was struggling to attract names for his leadership campaign. Those who had publicly backed him were low-grade backbenchers, some with dubious reputations. He was becoming agitated with his team, and seeking higher-profile support. Truss broke cover to declare her allegiance, going on BBC Radio 4 to defend Johnson on a litany of awkward topics, from extramarital affairs to the imprisonment of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. “She was canny, she decided Johnson could win, unlike Priti [Patel] who ummed and ahhed about it for ages,” one senior member of the team recalled. Though campaigners are hesitant to class her as part of the inner team, she attended a number of the preparations for government meetings, off-grid with key advisers such as Lord Frost, to discuss priorities. “Some of it was to keep her busy,” the staffer recalled. During the 2019 election, Truss pitched to Johnson that a US trade deal should be one of the key pledges of the campaign. The senior team in Downing Street were gobsmacked, believing it would give Jeremy Corbyn an open goal to talk about selling off the NHS to the US. “How about we do not talk about this at all?” one said. Another said: “She wanted to show what great things could be achieved post-Brexit – it’s typical Liz optimism – but the problem is we weren’t going to get one.” Many of those close to Johnson now admit Truss was a success as international trade secretary despite some initial reservations. Under her, the UK signed a deal with Japan and rolled over a number of strategically important deals – with Canada, Israel, Singapore and others. “She has been much better in the roles that suited her – in the Treasury, at trade and she may well be better at [the Foreign Office]. It plays to her strengths,” the former cabinet minister said. Others more dismissively consider her as just a valuable frontwoman. “She was good at getting out there, talking about great British produce, and the actual work is done by officials,” a senior No 10 official said. “It’s like putting someone in for a driving test in a self-driving car.” One Whitehall source said that was unfair. “She is an economist and in the negotiations she had serious grip of the detail. She knew what tweaks she wanted to make. And she often got her own way.” If Johnson wanted to keep his rival busy, he has succeeded. Truss’s brief is enormous: foreign secretary, Brexit negotiations, international development and equalities minister. Truss may now be in the job which comes with maximum peril for her leadership chances, but any success is likely to significantly bolster her standing. “Ireland is going to kill her,” a former Foreign Office official predicted. “She wants to prove her Brexiter credentials but there is no way to win with this strategy. That threat in the Sunday Telegraph [on triggering article 16] was not the correct approach. “Now, if she caves in, the right will abandon her, and that’s the very constituency she needs for the leadership.” Though many MPs consider true Brexit believer status to be less important, Truss backed remain in the 2016 referendum, speaking about not wanting her own daughters to “need a visa or permit to work in Europe, or where they are hampered from growing a business because of extortionate call costs and barriers to trade”. “She has done incredibly well at erasing her remainer past,” a senior Conservative said. “But I think when we get to a leadership contest, she will have a huge challenge going against Rishi Sunak, Michael Gove, Nadhim Zahawi. “Not particularly because they were true Brexiters but more because the question will be: are you true to yourself? Rishi, Michael and Boris too, they all took personal hits for their beliefs. She will never do that.”",News/Politics,Liz Truss: the ‘human hand grenade’ Tories have taken to their hearts,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/20/liz-truss-the-human-hand-grenade-tories-have-taken-to-their-hearts
1/20/2022,"On the last Sunday before the 2019 general election, the Sunday Times cast its vote. “Mr Johnson is regarded with some suspicion by voters,” its editorial admitted. “He has an on-off relationship with the truth,” often preferred “bluster to grasp of detail”, and had a “colourful private life more typical of a French president”. Nonetheless, the paper urged its readers to put a liar, a bullshitter and a renowned moral incontinent in charge of the country. In making this argument, it was joined by the vast majority of national newspapers, and by the end of that week they got their wish. Over the past few days, those very same papers have discovered that a liar, a bullshitter and a moral incontinent runs the government. They are, naturally, horrified.  The furies are now descending upon this prime minister. Having thoroughly chewed him up and digested every last point of polling advantage, the party he led to its first serious majority in 30 years is about to spit him out; the very MPs who most directly owe him their seats are plotting his demise. The obit already being written is about how one man, beset by monstrous flaws of character, presided over a rotten, insensate culture in Downing Street. Scarcely a word is said about how a rotten political culture chose this cracked actor to be prime minister in the first place. Even to ask the question is to divert from Westminster’s splendid game of Pop Goes the Weaselly Politician. Yet look around and count the examples of a truly ulcerous politics. Here are the columnists, gravely warning that to cling on to Boris Johnson is to endanger democracy – two years after excusing his attempts to shut down parliament and ram through his Brexit. Over there are the backbenchers, mutinying not because their leader broke his own lockdown rules but over how this might affect their careers. Heckling from the wings is breachfinder-general Dominic Cummings, apparently unencumbered by any shame over his own eye test at Barnard Castle. Centre stage is, of course, Johnson, on trial not for racking up the highest Covid death toll in Europe, but for telling people to follow one rule and doing precisely the opposite. For, in other words, hypocrisy – one of the few things, as Alan Bennett has observed, at which the English still lead the world. In saying this, I am not making light of the Downing Street parties. In spring 2020, my mother passed away. It is part of my culture for friends to come over with meals for the bereaved, to sit with them in mourning. Friends handed over carrier bags of food from the road. Given the public health emergency, there was no question of them coming inside. My wife and I sat alone. More fool us. Yet, even as I recall that painful period, the charges on which Johnson is now arraigned still strike me as odd. Winking at rules, lying about it afterwards … what did people think he was going to do? He practically bragged about his ability to pull off such feats. He converted what most of us would consider vices into political virtues, which is partly why the election of 2019 was an event of such consequence. Bringing great institutions into disrepute? It was much-corroded institutions that cheered him into No 10. Johnson won every single ballot of Conservative MPs in 2019, and swept the vote of party members. He repaid the debt by filleting the parliamentary party of many of its most competent members, on the grounds they disagreed with his hastily scrawled plan for Brexit. During an election campaign in which he hid from an interviewer in a giant fridge, and pocketed a journalist’s mobile phone after refusing to look at a photo of a sick child sleeping on a hospital floor, most of the media persisted in treating him not as a threat to freedom of the press but as the best standup on the Leave circuit. What fuelled Johnson’s ascent was how well he learned a lesson of predecessors on the right: you could break the institutions that held the UK together as a social democracy and dissolve its political trust. You could be a political vandal, an economic bulldozer and a class bully, and still the press would praise you as statesmanlike, while the public handed you a landslide. From Margaret Thatcher onwards, the right has broken up the public sector into something the lobbyists, the consultants and the profiteers can freely loot. Electricity, water, council housing, the railways: all have been turned into so many troughs for the pinstripe hordes to sup at. Underneath the blond mop and behind the great toothy grin, Johnson’s pitch has always been that he will destroy the rest. Of course he’s bad at government: he believes government is bad. To stave off the inevitable, Johnson has come up with an escape plan of rightwing policies, charmingly referred to by the government of Ghana – which would apparently be receiving some of Britain’s asylum seekers – as Operation Dead Meat. It is the same programme of bulldozing institutions, but this time played at manic intensity and speed. Scapegoating senior civil servants for the wine suitcases in Downing Street. Freezing the BBC licence fee and warning Auntie that soon the cupboard will be entirely bare. Almost certainly the next thing to be thrown overboard will be parts of the net zero programme. These aren’t aimed at winning back the public, but kissing up to the rightwing press and the Tory headbangers who can keep him in No 10. What’s left is a punitive state: the military supposedly seeing off desperate Afghans in small boats, the police deciding who is or isn’t entitled to go on a demo. The antithesis to all this is not a return to normalcy led by the political management class, whatever the talking heads might say. The Right Hon Member for Greensill or the chancellor for BlackRock were just as determined at trashing the public sector. All those decrying Johnson as a sociopath would do well to read the recent paper in the peer-reviewed BMJ Open, which finds that over just four years in England alone David Cameron’s austerity was responsible for more than 57,000 deaths. The route out of this debacle begins with recognising that a mere change in personnel at No 10, even at the very top, will alter next to nothing. It would be far better to repair the country’s shattered institutions, and allow communities to build their own, both economic and political. This also means a dramatic shift of power away from Westminster. Until then, we are left with the pathetic sight of a rule-breaker who vows more law and order. A public-school populist who dissembles like any other politician. An authoritarian whose authority has drained away.

1/20/2022,"A new apartment skyscraper with just one fire escape staircase is being planned just a few hundred metres from Grenfell Tower in a move that survivors of the disaster have called “shocking”. The proposed tower would be around twice the height of Grenfell and accommodate hundreds of households, but it will rely on the same “stay put” strategy that failed on 14 June 2017 contributing to deaths, according to planning documents. That means that under current building regulations it will require only a single escape staircase.  The tower would have flats up to 35 storeys as part of a complex of 1,760 new homes being planned by the owner of the Westfield shopping centre in west London. The scheme, by Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (URW), a £46bn global developer specialising in shopping centres, includes a second tower which is also designed with a single fire escape. The planning application is going ahead at a time when the government is reviewing the provision of escape routes in building regulations “to ensure residents are safe in the event of a fire”. Grenfell United, a group representing the survivors and bereaved, said: “After half a decade of campaigning for safer homes, it’s shocking to hear that a new tower block, a stone’s throw from Grenfell, rigged with a fire safety defect before it’s even been built, is being planned.” It considers a single staircase inadequate for use by residents and firefighters if an evacuation is needed, even though it is allowable under building regulations. The developer insists building safety is a key priority. Apartments in the new complex will feature sprinklers and there will be evacuation lifts for disabled residents. It will also have 100% non-combustible facades. The strategy in the event of a fire is for residents to “stay put” on the basis that the building is designed to stop fires spreading from flat to flat. But some safety experts have said it is “madness” that single staircases are still allowed, not least after the Grenfell disaster where, once an evacuation was necessary, some residents were unable to escape through the smoke-logged staircase that was used by evacuees and firefighters, and the stay put policy was kept in place for too long, costing lives. “This is flying by the seat of our pants,” said Arnold Tarling, an independent fire engineer, who said a single staircase only worked if smoke ventilation systems, firefighting lifts, door closers and other safety systems were rigorously maintained. “Commercial buildings have to have multiple staircases. You are better cared for in a commercial building than a residential one.” As part of the wider building safety crisis, faults have been found in the construction of hundreds of apartment blocks which mean fires and smoke could spread from flat to flat, rendering the stay-put strategy dangerous. When a fire last May injured three people at an east London tower block, ventilation systems, the firefighter lift and door holders did not perform as expected. Pressure is now growing for a change in the rules on staircases. Last week the developer of a 51-storey apartment tower close to Canary Wharf withdrew its application from a planning hearing amid alarm that it featured only one staircase. Some fire experts want to bring the UK into line with dozens of other countries where two or more escape stairs are required on tall buildings. A spokesperson for URW said: “Building safety is a key priority for any of our developments and as part of the design process we have engaged a fire engineer to ensure that access and egress arrangements for fire brigades and occupants satisfies the London Plan guidelines and meet all required building safety protocols. We also work very closely with the local authority planning department, who in turn work with the London fire brigadedirectly to ensure applications are in line with regulations. In addition, our buildings have other mitigation measures in place including sprinklers throughout the buildings and the use of 100% non-combustible facades.” A spokesperson for the London borough of Hammersmith and Fulham, the planning authority, said: “The safety of residents is our number one priority. We take a tough line with developers to ensure that anything they build is fully compliant with all safety and other regulations as a minimum, and that local people are fully consulted.” A fire brigade spokesperson said: “We are aware of this development and we will be providing a response to the planning consultation.”",News/Society,Tower twice Grenfell’s height planned nearby with single staircase,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/20/tower-twice-grenfell-height-planned-single-staircase-urw
1/20/2022,"As the Omicron variant rips through the US, children are being infected with Covid-19 in record numbers – yet their rate of vaccination has lagged, creating a surge in hospitalizations and undermining in-person schooling. Nearly a million new Covid cases – more than 981,000 – were confirmed in children in the week ending 13 January, a 69% increase from the week before and four times higher than last winter’s peak, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. That means one in 10 Covid cases among children in the entire pandemic have happened in the past week, the organization said.  Adult rates have shot up, too, with an average of more than 870,000 confirmed cases a day in the US – but children have much lower vaccination rates. Only 18.8% of kids aged five to 11, and a little more than half of 12- to 17-year-olds, are fully vaccinated, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hospitalizations for kids are soaring, although severe illness and death are much less likely for children than adults. “Tons and tons of kids are getting infected this time,” said Almaz Dessie, assistant professor of pediatrics in emergency medicine at Columbia University medical center. Yet vaccinations are lagging. After a short burst of children’s vaccinations soon after the shot was authorized for the five to 11 age group, progress dropped significantly. At the New York emergency department where she sees patients, Dessie offers Covid-19 vaccines for kids who come in with non-Covid issues, such as sprained ankles or broken bones. “We’re seeing a pretty low level of uptake, even now,” she said. The biggest surprise for Dessie has been talking to vaccinated adults who inoculate their kids against other diseases – but are holding off with Covid. “People just want a little more time just to see what happens with the vaccine, because it’s so new,” Dessie said. But when it comes to vaccination, she notes, “the benefits are pretty substantial, both to the individual child and to their community”. Paul Offit, a professor of pediatrics in the division of infectious diseases at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, recently cared for children being admitted with Covid complications. “None of them were vaccinated. No one over five was vaccinated,” he said. Although Covid complications for children are rarer than for adults, they still happen, and more cases means more chances for kids to become seriously ill. For example, multi-system inflammatory disease in children is one rare but severe outcome from Covid infection that “can be serious and fatal”, Offit said. Lagging vaccination rates have also contributed to schools struggling to stay open, as students and staff are sickened by the more-transmissible variant. Offit was recently asked about parents who are worried about sending their children to school during the Omicron surge. “OK, then vaccinate them,” he said. “We’re talking about trying to keep them safe. Here’s an idea: vaccinate your children.” Vaccines for eligible children don’t just protect their health and the health of those around them, Dessie said: they can also keep schools open and the rest of society functioning. “There are so many things that children need from school: the socialization, the social supports for low-income children, all of that,” she said. “We need kids in school, and reducing transmission in school will be most easily be achieved by having all children be vaccinated who are eligible.” Experts say that layering all precautions together – vaccines and boosters, masks, tests, better ventilation and physical distancing – can keep schools safer, but some school districts have been unable or unwilling to do so. In Oregon, hit by a 400% increase in cases in the past two weeks, a group of school nurses have decried the lack of effective precautions. “Messaging that schools are safe – without taking the steps to make them safe – does not keep children safe,” the 36 nurses wrote in a letter to Portland public schools on Sunday. School nurses have been on one of the frontlines of the pandemic, said Linda Mendonça, president of the National Association of School Nurses. “It’s been very challenging,” she said. “They’ve had to really jump into high gear and do things that they normally don’t do on a daily basis.” School nurses frequently trace contacts, test, implement mitigation strategies and run vaccination clinics – all on top of their usual work, which has already become more difficult given the pandemic’s immense physical and emotional burdens. Implementing every layer of safety is “absolutely” key to continuing in-person learning safely, she said. “Vaccination is one of the [major] public health strategies we have in our toolbox to help fight this pandemic.” Dessie said she understands families’ hesitations and fears: “They want the best for their kids. “It’s scary to be a parent right now, and it’s scary to constantly have to make decisions for your child. Everything feels like a risk,” she said. But the vanishingly rare side-effects of vaccines “are so small compared to the risk of Covid and severe disease from Covid – and all the people they can affect if they get Covid themselves”. It’s important to explain the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines, she said, and to discuss all questions families have – including the unknowns of what happens if you get Covid while unvaccinated. “We don’t know, even with mild Covid, what that means for kids,” she said. Long Covid, too, remains little understood, including in children. Vaccinating everyone, including children, is a crucial part of ending the global spread of the virus, Dessie said. “The more vaccinations you have, across our country and globally, the less likely we are to have the emergence of those new variants like what we just saw the last few months.”",News/US news,US children’s Covid vaccinations lag despite record infections,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/20/us-children-covid-vaccinations-cases-hospitalizations
1/20/2022,"My first experience of office life was daunting. You might expect one’s first experience of working in an office environment to be pretty gentle: making the tea, a bit of filing, running errands for the boss. Not a bit of it, in my case. Aged 20, with no experience of office life, I was the boss. And, just to add a little spice to the task, I was totally blind. My job as a community service volunteer at Youth Action York was to persuade a sceptical group of teenagers to give a helping hand to local elderly or disabled people who were struggling – assisting them with their shopping, perhaps, or tidying up their garden. It felt like a challenge, and my teenage volunteers made sure it was.  The phone would often ring, only for me to find the handset wasn’t where I expected it to be. Eventually, I would realise it had been hidden – usually in a filing cabinet or drawer, which may have also been locked. The teenage volunteers found this very funny – and, actually, so did I. At a time when braille was added to magazines by spraying on small plastic dots, they sometimes took to melting the bottom lines of pages too, much to everyone’s amusement. I can feel the disability lobby revving up as they read this. That is bullying, they will say, and what’s more, by laughing along with them, I was contributing to my own discrimination. But I didn’t feel like that back then, and I don’t think that now. They were spiky teenagers, and they were doing to me what they routinely did to each other: looking for the weakest point and giving it a jab. Until I began working in that office, I’d been at a special blind school, where the teasing was merciless, and where I’d learned what real bullying could be like. But many of the Youth Action teens became my first close full-sighted friends and remained so long after I left York. It was the nearest I’d got to acceptance by a group of streetwise kids. In any case, I found revenge a far more satisfying and effective tactic than querulous complaint. I had a couple of packs of braille playing cards and started to play poker with some of the volunteers on quiet afternoons. I enjoyed a rather good run of luck, and a bit of money changed hands before I let on that, with a very keen sense of touch, you could read which cards you were dealing as you dealt them. My workmates were indignant, but impressed. It’s not true, of course, but as long as they thought it was, and that they had been cheated, I felt honour was satisfied. I’d evened up the score.",Lifestyle/Life and style,"Memories of office life: at 20 and blind, my workmates pranked me mercilessly – and I loved it",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/20/memories-of-office-life-at-20-and-blind-my-workmates-pranked-me-mercilessly-and-i-loved-it
1/20/2022,"Staff at England’s Environment Agency say it has been cut back to such an extent that they cannot do their jobs and the regulator is no longer a deterrent to polluters. Three officers at the EA have described to the Guardian and Ends Report how they are increasingly unable to hold polluters to account or improve the environment as a result of the body’s policies.  The officers wish to remain anonymous because the EA’s chief executive, Sir James Bevan, has “been very clear that he will sack anybody that is seen to be openly criticising the agency”, one officer said. The Environment Agency has a large budget but the officers say it is not being directed towards protecting or improving the environment. Government grants to the agency rose from £880m to £1.05bn over the past two years, and money for flood operations has steadily increased. But government funding for the agency’s environmental protection work has slumped from about £170m in 2009-10 to a low of £76m in 2019-20, and £94m last year. As a result, work that does not generate any income for the agency, such as attending pollution incidents, has been deprioritised, say the officers. Last week the Guardian revealed that the agency would no longer respond to lower-impact pollution incidents. One EA officer said there had been a “drive to make the agency almost entirely self-sufficient, so if you can’t charge for something it gets a lower priority, which is why a lot of the officer roles have been cut – those that go out to pollution events and inspect works … it’s been cut and cut and cut and left us where we are at the moment, which is with a very limited resource on that side.” In a speech on Tuesday, Bevan signalled that he would like industry to eventually pay the full cost of its regulation, alongside tougher punishments for polluters that could lead to custodial sentences for the worst offenders. A second officer said increases in charges and other agency income filled the gap left by dwindling government grants but the money did not find its way to frontline work. Instead it was directed to middle management, they said. “Part of the theory of paying for a permit is that a certain percentage is used to tackle illegal activity that operates without one,” they said. “Yet frontline officers have to watch this money go elsewhere, usually to fill newly created management roles that have no impact on frontline duties. The only sectors to benefit are the operators who want to avoid meaningful regulation. The Environment Agency appears to be making a choice to direct current funding away from frontline water quality.” Other moves by the agency that are said to stifle fieldwork include “new incident teams that don’t leave the office” and the “removal of lease cars to attend incidents”. Issuing permits for a potentially polluting activity, such as discharging effluent into a river, brings money into the agency, but one officer said that when making a decision on the activity, “we’re told, largely through the permitting process, to give business the benefit of the doubt, rather than the environment. “Unless you can find a 100% solid reason not to grant something, you will grant it. The precautionary principle, which is what a lot of these decisions should be based on, is not prevalent … we don’t really get to use it.” Permitting decisions are further undermined by the patchy nature of the agency’s data, according to the insiders. “It’s all tied up with the fact that our monitoring now is a lot poorer,” one officer said. “When you try to make a decision on an impact of something, it’s so much more difficult to prove because the data isn’t there any more. Priority is given to the applicant rather than the environment unless it’s absolutely clearcut.” The upshot is that the agency’s funding and operational decisions have “resulted in a regulator that is toothless,” said one officer. “Should a polluter be caught, any tools that were at [its] disposal to take action have been systematically removed … Officers are actively encouraged not to take enforcement action, and asked to find another solution. We are no longer a deterrent to polluters.” There is considerable anger among staff that “those who adhere to the legislation are paying significant sums, whilst those that chose to ignore the legislation escape any charge or meaningful punishment,” according to one officer. Another officer said the reduction in enforcement activity would “embolden people to break the law because they know that there’s not really a strong police force out there watching over them and able to take any form of significant action against them”. The overall feeling is that areas such as water quality are “no longer a priority and the environment in most cases is expendable. There appears to be a direction aimed at working alongside water companies, industry and agriculture, rather than regulating them. “The Environment Agency is as far removed from the ‘polluter pays’ principle as it has ever been, and what is most concerning is that this appears to be by design,” said one. Being unable to get out into the field to do the jobs they were hired to do has also taken its toll on staff morale, according to the officers. “Morale is so low, and the main reason for that is our poor performance on water quality and enforcement – it upsets people when they see the stuff they’re passionate about being red-carded and ignored,” said one officer. Another said: “The majority of staff joined the Environment Agency because of a vocation for environmental protection, and their morale is at rock bottom because they are being asked to ignore this vocation with no visible justification.” Another officer said: “You’ve got a lot of very passionate, very well meaning people, very often forbidden from doing their jobs to the full. They join the agency because they care, they really want to make a difference, [but then] their ambitions are invariably stifled and slowly blunted by an organisation that just grinds them down and gives them very few opportunities to make a difference.” An Environment Agency spokesperson said: “Our staff are vital to our work to protect the environment, people and wildlife from harm, and we are committed to providing a healthy and high-quality working environment. “Our most recent employee people survey highlights many positive aspects of working at the Environment Agency – with staff engagement at 68% and the majority reporting they like their job, feel supported in their health, safety and wellbeing, and want to stay within the organisation. However, we are not complacent and understand the last few years have been particularly challenging for all public servants. We continue to listen to and act upon feedback from our staff as a key priority.”",News/Environment,Staff blow whistle on Environment Agency that ‘no longer deters polluters’,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/20/environment-agency-cuts-staff-blow-whistle
1/20/2022,"On Saturday, Rozina Ghulam Mustafa arrived at the market in Tando Allahyar city, Pakistan’s Sindh province, to sell the goats she had raised, milked and fed. Usually her brother sells the animals, but he sold them too cheaply because he didn’t know their true value. “He has always sold our goats at a much lower price,” she says, standing inside an enclosure with 15 of them.  For Mustafa, joining hundreds of women to trade animals at Marui livestock market – believed to be Pakistan’s first women-led livestock market – was a big moment. By the afternoon, she had yet to sell any animals, but was unperturbed. “That’s OK; it’s my first time and I will learn how to trade,” she says. “For the first time I felt free, I could make the decision of buying and selling myself.” Women in rural Pakistan have always reared animals, taking care of nutrition, milking and vaccinations and keeping their barns and sheds clean. But when the time comes for them to be sold, women are excluded. Taking the animals to market is considered a man’s job. Mustafa’s 65-year-old mother, Rehmat, who accompanied her to the market with Mustafa’s brother, says that when she was younger “it was unthinkable for a woman to come to the market and sell; it was a man’s job”. “I think this change is in the right direction. If women can rear, women can buy and sell, like men. What is so complicated about it?” The market is busy. Children run between the animal enclosures and stalls selling homemade ghee (clarified butter), eggs, chickens, animal fodder and ornaments. Other stalls sell food, tea and hand-embroidered women’s clothing. The local government has a stall showcasing veterinary medicines. Perween Panhwar has just bought her first goat for 19,000 PKR (£80) to start her livestock farm. “When I heard there was a women-led livestock market, I wanted the first animal I buy for the farm to be from this market,” she says. Lakshmi Phuto has travelled 12 miles (20km) from her village to the market. She has been given 30,000 PRK from a local NGO to buy livestock to help set up her farm. By the end of the day, Phuto has bought a lactating goat for 20,000 PKR. “Just the kind we wanted, with big ears and this big in height,” she says, raising her hand about three feet from the ground. The rest of her money will be spent on “good quality food”. It is hoped that the market, organised by Tando Allahyar district government and local NGO the Research and Development Foundation (RDF), will encourage more women into the livestock sector. It is part of a six-year Growth for Rural Advancement and Sustainable Progress project to strengthen small-scale agribusinesses and reduce poverty in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, run in partnership with the International Trade Centre and the World Trade Organization. “This is a great idea!” says Mustafa Talpur, regional advocacy and campaigns lead at Oxfam Asia, who has worked in the water and agriculture sector for more than 10 years. “Having separate women’s markets or a share in existing agriculture markets will help them to engage.” Dr Mazhar Ali Rind, deputy director of the government’s livestock department, hopes similar markets will be organised across the country. “To my knowledge, this is the first of its kind in Pakistan,” he says. “Many women-led households depend on the village men with business acumen for negotiating with strangers. They allow them to take their animals to the market, and pay a fee of up to 2,000 PKR for each animal sold. But now that they have learned the process, they can do it on their own. The middlemen’s role can be eliminated.” Ashfaque Soomro, chief executive at RDF, plans to run the market at Tando Allahyar every month. “Now that these women are familiar with this place, getting here will be easier for them; many can now come on their own or in groups and will not need men to accompany them,” he says. Soomro is confident the market will grow and attract many more women. “Now we need to bring in buyers from cities like Karachi and Hyderabad.”",News/Global development,"‘For the first time, I felt free’: Pakistan’s women-led livestock market",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/20/for-the-first-time-i-felt-free-pakistans-women-led-livestock-market
1/20/2022,"Annoyed Currys customers seem to feature fairly regularly on your pages and the consensus seems to be “buyer beware”. However, I’ve discovered you don’t have to be a customer to have your time wasted. I was emailed an e-receipt from the Wednesbury store (almost 200 miles from where I live) for a £1,589 television. I had not made this purchase and was anxious to discover if this was fraud or error. The email address on the receipt was no longer in operation, and the web chat didn’t work so I had to call customer services. I was promised a response within 48 hours, but heard nothing more. Meanwhile, I was besieged by daily emails thanking me for my purchase, and offering associated deals. I called again, and was passed between operatives who again promised a response within 48 hours. One said he’d put me through to the fraud department and connected me to the police. All I received since then was an email asking for feedback on my recent purchase.CJ, Wareham, Dorset  Your experience highlights two concerning issues: firstly Currys’s seeming indifference to a possible case of fraud or error. And secondly, its bombardment of customers who do choose to make a purchase. I’ve previously exposed follow-up phone messages from the company within hours of a sale which customers – and even some agents – assumed were from scammers. It turned out the company was using mobile phone numbers required for delivery updates to hard-sell extended warranties (Currys calls them “care plans”). It claims that its volley of after-sales communications is to make customers feel “supported”. It seems it’s less keen on being contacted by customers who need support. Only after I asked it to explain your predicament did it acknowledge it had made an error. It claims the email of the customer who bought the TV differed from yours by one digit and was inputted wrongly. Your details have now been deleted and the correct customer contacted with the receipt and, doubtless, the onslaught of sales pitches. Currys has paid you £50 in goodwill and says it’s truly sorry for the distress caused. Significantly, no remorse for its failure to address the mistake before media involvement.

1/20/2022,"Mass is a wonderfully acted, if claustrophobic, ordeal of emotional pain. Perhaps against the odds, it achieves in its final moments a breakthrough of understanding and acceptance – and moves beyond its rather theatrically contrived confrontation, which may have been inspired by Yasmina Reza’s play God of Carnage, filmed by Roman Polanski in 2011. But it’s impossible not to be affected by the sincerity of this debut from actor-turned-director Fran Kranz, whose film shows that the subject of school shootings and their aftermath can be treated without the ironised horror of, say, Lionel Shriver’s We Need to Talk About Kevin. The scene is a church in Idaho that has evidently offered its premises as the venue – a safe space, perhaps – for a healing encounter between the parents of a boy killed six years previously in a school shooting and the parents of the boy who killed him. (Franz allows us to register that there happens to be a slightly truculent young man volunteering at the church, who might resemble both of the boys.) Quite aside from the grief and despair, there is bad feeling about announcements made at the time through lawyers and the media, and now everyone needs closure.  Linda (Ann Dowd) and Richard (Reed Birney) are the shooter’s mum and dad: Linda is in agony, needing absolution from the other couple, or from her husband, or from God, or from the universe; Richard is more buttoned-up, angry, suspicious of the emotional loss of control required of him and incidentally also sceptical about the need for gun control. Jay (Jason Isaacs) and Gail (Martha Plimpton) are tensely resolved that this meeting is their only way forward, ready to listen and forgive, but clearly very wary of any suggestion that their son’s death is somehow equivalent to the death of his attacker. Mass is performed with impeccable intelligence and sensitivity, although sometimes it feels like an exercise in award-winning acting. But I admit it: the final, unexpected dialogue scene, though arguably as stagey and showy as everything else, does deliver a punch.  Mass is released on 20 January in cinemas and on Sky Cinema.",Arts/Film,Mass review – impeccably acted school shooter reckoning,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/20/mass-review-impeccably-acted-school-shooter-reckoning
1/20/2022,"United Australia party leader Craig Kelly has used a parliamentary inquiry on social media and online safety to take Google and Facebook to task over the removal of his party’s videos from YouTube and his ban from Facebook for pushing unproven treatments for Covid-19. United Australia Party has spent close to $5m advertising its videos on YouTube since Kelly became leader of the party in August, accounting for about 98% of all political ad spend on YouTube in Australia during that time. YouTube has not banned the account or ceased taking money from the party, but it has removed a number of the party’s videos for allegedly violating its community guidelines.  Kelly was also banned from Facebook and Instagram last year for posts promoting unproven Covid-19 treatments such as ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. In a parliamentary committee hearing on Thursday, the member for Hughes questioned Google, Facebook and TikTok mainly using examples of each of these services taking action against content he or his party had posted. He questioned why a speech he had given in parliament was removed from YouTube, and he had “countless examples” where content had been removed. Google’s director of government affairs and public policy in Australia, Lucinda Longcroft, told Kelly that the same community guidelines that apply to the public apply to public figures such as himself. “Our policies are applied regardless of the nature of the person [or] the position may hold,” she said. Longcroft said Google’s Covid-19 policies had been developed based on advice from around the world. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “This information policy, which was developed at the start of the pandemic, is probably published on our website. It is quite detailed. It takes into account very clear guidelines from global authorities, [the] World Health Organization, as well as trusted medical and scientific authorities and governmental authorities. “And it is constantly reviewed and revised as scientific medical information is updated, and we work very closely with experts.” The UAP has so far avoided reaching the threshold of having three strikes against the account in 90 days, which would lead to a permanent suspension. The deputy chair of the committee, Labor MP Tim Watts, had himself reported nine UAP videos to YouTube, but only six of those were removed. He asked why each video removed did not count as a single strike, and Longcroft said YouTube “bundled” reported videos together. “If a number of videos are found to be violative at the same time they are bundled into one strike,” she said. “I’ll remember to stretch them out next time,” Watts replied. He also criticised Google for continuing to accept money from the UAP – even after it had allowed the party to promote videos that were later removed. “We are in the middle of a pandemic, we know he is a repeat offender, yet you’re doing nothing to stop him amplifying content,” he said. “We certainly are doing everything in our power to stop him and every other person who might promulgate misinformation relating to Covid or other on our platforms,” Longcroft said. “We do not seek to profit [from] that misinformation and our ad policies and enforcement is in line with that.” When the hearing moved to Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, Kelly said Facebook had “blood on its hands” for blocking information on Covid-19 treatments, and asked if they thought his ban from the platform had interfered with his duties as an MP because he was unable to communicate with constituents through the platform. Facebook’s director of public policy in Australia, Mia Garlick, said Facebook was a tool politicians could use. “I think people use our services in a range of different ways. And so I don’t really want to commit to any one generalisation for all of the members of parliament,” she said. The then speaker of the House of Representatives, Tony Smith, had already ruled there was no evidence that the ban was targeted at Kelly in his capacity as a member of parliament. When TikTok appeared, officials admitted Kelly had been suspended from the platform in error, and a video he had posted had been “over-moderated”. In the absence of Twitter from the hearing, Kelly asked representatives from industry body DIGI about a tweet related to “a certain person in my electorate” calling that person “a massive fuckhead”. Kelly said it was false and defamatory and said it was a “massive failure” the tweet was allowed to be posted and had been up for three days. A tweet matching the date of posting, the number of likes and retweets mentioned was a tweet about Kelly.",News/Australia news,Craig Kelly rebukes Google and Facebook for removal of his content at social media inquiry,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/20/craig-kelly-rebukes-google-and-facebook-for-removal-of-his-content-at-social-media-inquiry
1/20/2022,"Doctors at a Nepal hospital trialling a new treatment for skin wounds say the technique, which mimics the scabbing process, has “enormous potential”. Trials at the mountaintop Anandaban leprosy hospital, south of Kathmandu, have been promising, bringing hope to patients worldwide. It is hoped that the treatment will also help millions living with diabetes, who have an increased risk of amputation.  Led by Birmingham university and funded by the National Institute for Health Research, a year-long randomised trial involving 130 adults has started to measure healing rates of leprosy ulcers. Prof Richard Lilford from Birmingham university, who is the project lead, said the intervention was similar to a scab forming to cover a wound on a child’s knee. “You might remember as a child grazing your knee and a scab forming. When the scab came off a few days later – bingo! The skin underneath had miraculously healed,” he said. “Maybe substances in the scab were promoting healing. We plan to test this idea in people affected by leprosy ulcers. Using the patient’s blood, my colleagues at Anandanban hospital in Kathmandu make a kind of artificial scab which is used to dress the ulcer. This has been widely used but never properly evaluated.” The patient’s own blood cells have been used to make a membrane in gel strips known as L-PRF that mimics the body’s natural healing processes. Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by a bacterium and Nepal has 3,200 new diagnoses every year. Despite positive changes in attitudes in Nepal, leprosy, a curable disease, still has much stigma and mythology attached, with thousands of cases remaining undiagnosed. “The prevalence rate of leprosy [in Nepal] is rising, though this may be due to improved reporting and active case finding,” says the trial’s research protocol. “While leprosy is curable with multi-drug therapy, Nepalese people may hide early symptoms due to stigma based on cultural perceptions that leprosy is a punishment for former life transgressions. Thus, there are often delays in presentation of leprosy, which can lead to the development of complex ulcers requiring long hospital stays.” Indra Napit, a senior surgeon at Anandaban hospital’s leprosy mission, said with the new treatment he has been seeing faster healing times. “If left untreated, leprosy causes nerve damage. As a result, people affected by leprosy have frequent hospital stays to cure ulcers, which can take many months or even years to heal,” he said. “But with L-PRF even the most severe ulcers could heal far quicker. This can prevent disability and even amputation. L-PRF can be life-changing for leprosy patients, as it means they can return to their families and jobs, if they are blessed to have them. “For us at Anandaban, there are so many benefits all round. Faster healing frees up hospital beds so we can treat more people.”",News/Global development,Nepal hospital trials ‘life-changing’ treatment for leprosy wounds,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/jan/20/nepal-hospital-trials-life-changing-treatment-for-leprosy-wounds
1/20/2022,"Sherrill Roland could not touch his daughter until she was nearly a year old. He had spent 10 months in prison for a crime he did not commit. “It was the first time I finally got out again and got to choose which clothes I actually put on and the first time I got to hold her,” he recalls by phone. “She gave me a big smile and I was just in awe.”  Roland, 37, a Black artist from Asheville, North Carolina, was exonerated in 2015. He has dug deep into his experience of wrongful incarceration for Hindsight Bias, an exhibition running at the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in New York until 5 February. The show only uses materials that were available to Roland while in prison and draws on his archive of letters, books and commissary lists (of items that inmates are permitted to purchase) for inspiration. From the ceiling at the gallery entrance, for example, the artist has hung four sculptures made of clear acrylic, shaped like big envelopes and etched with language that was stamped on mail he sent by the department of corrections in Washington. In the main gallery space, two 8ft by 8ft acrylic cubes recall a basketball tournament that Roland helped organise within his housing unit in conjunction with March Madness. In the rear gallery, five lightbox sculptures bear abstracted text from letters that Roland wrote to the mother of his daughter while incarcerated. But what the exhibition does not reveal is the crime of which Roland was accused. He prefers to maintain silence on the topic, refusing to breathe new life into the false charge. “It ends up bringing in too much of the other side,” he explains. “I know it may sound weird but anything that I have moving forward with my life, with my narrative, I’m trying to have as much control over that as possible. “A lot of folks who are more famous exonerees than myself, who have done more time inside than I’ve been alive, oftentimes their narratives are led with the false accusation. That’s kind of hard to get in front of when you were innocent the entire time. So for me to have control over it, I’m just not saying that in that way. It’s me in my innocence, if that makes sense. “But when I do talks and stuff like that, I try to walk down many different ways it could be or it could have gone on, so I say it’s like armed robbery or rape or something like that. We can use it as an avatar of thinking of the many prejudices that come associated with any charge.” What is known is that, in August 2012, Roland was in his first year of grad school at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro when he received notification on his phone from a detective in Washington that a warrant was out for his arrest. The alleged offence had taken place in the capital. Roland spent about nine anxious months awaiting an indictment but it never came. “I thought at that moment: finally, it’s over,” he recalls. “It wasn’t. They had opportunity to lower the felonies to misdemeanours and then they took me to a bench trial.” The bench trial has no jury, only a judge, and Roland lost the case. His life was turned upside down: from art school to prison. He was sentenced to a year and 30 days at the Central Detention Facility in Washington. With time knocked off for good behaviour and for obtaining a job inside, he eventually served 10 months and two weeks. He describes it as a dehumanising experience. “Start with the stripping of one’s identity once incarcerated. My name has less weight than my inmate number and so it’s easy to tell me no or to drop my belongings on the floor because I’m only allowed to have a certain amount of belongings anyways. “It’s easy to tell me to go back to a room or to not speak or do something because my privileges consist of just being around another person. The gravity of that is you’re going to isolation. No getting out of this seven-by-nine cell or anything like that. So these small things become large things: to humble yourself to ask for additional toilet paper or toothbrushes that stretch no longer than your thumb.” Roland continues: “Out here in the world, I can wear whatever shoes I want or dress up the outfit. We can dress blue one day. We can dress in all black or we can be full of colour. But in there, everybody is wearing the exact same thing. You are who you are and there’s no hiding who you are. There’s no dressing it up, there’s no faking it. “For me personally, it was just the pain of why I was even there in the first place. Me being lost in that space was tough because that reality was very in your face every morning, every night. It was 23 hours lock-ins, one hour out, so I had a lot of time in my head, in my cell with the person I just met.” He was forced to miss both his grandmothers’ funerals as well as the birth of his first child, Soraya, whom he would not meet in person until his release. Did his family and friends doubt his innocence? “Everybody that loves and cares for me definitely had my back and trusted in me and knowing who I am. But a lot of the assumptions were like TV: ‘How do you not know? Were you there? Did they mistake you for somebody else?’ We went through the easy ones but everything isn’t like TV and I had absolutely no answers. With those no answers came breeding doubt. “How much doubt I don’t know. But the most hurtful thing was, ‘I knew that you questioned it, though. I don’t know how much you question if I did it or not, but I do see you wrestling with questioning, and that’s the hurtful part because I can’t do anything else but tell you I didn’t do it. I can’t produce anything.’ It was a crazy, crazy situation but the situation had absolutely nothing to do with me.” Roland would eventually quash all doubts and be proved innocent. He secured a retrial six months after his release. He won it in April 2015. He then won an exoneration trial that December. The ordeal was at last over. Since then, he has tried to process what happened through performance art such as The Jumpsuit Project, in which he wears an orange prison jumpsuit and engages people in conversations about prejudice and stigma around incarceration. He says: “Opportunity sounds like a bad word, but I was granted access to a place where obviously we don’t get permission to go. I’ve had family members and friends who were incarcerated before and then when I came home I didn’t need to apologise but in a way I felt like, ‘Oh man, I had absolutely no idea.’ “I wish I could have visited them more or maybe I should have wrote you a letter more. I didn’t know what it was like until I got on that other side of the wall and mostly that’s what’s communicated through the work: trying to bring people’s eyes a little closer to these small moments that might not seem like a lot, but they are heavy on that inside.” The limits of the coronavirus pandemic encouraged Roland to hunker down and make physical objects, leading to Hindsight Bias. “I still only use the same materials I had access to while I was incarcerated. That’s my toolbox. But with this work in this space, it’s like looking in a mirror of some of these experiences. There’s some work that is very personal in it and I’m happy to finally get to a place where I can express it.” From his unique vantage point, Roland hopes to stimulate much-needed debate about reform of America’s broken criminal justice system. “A lot of the individuals I was incarcerated with, it wasn’t necessarily a conversation about innocence. It’s about fairness and justice and so, even though some individuals I was in there with may admit to making a mistake, they were being leveraged to taking more time and being abused by the system. “With my time on probation, I constantly had to drug test and do all these things when I got out. I wasn’t able to leave the city limits, even though I never have lived there. The bar was set so high. I can’t even imagine somebody who didn’t have my friends and family and that type of support, how you could manage simple probation things. You’d be right back in there.” Despite everything, Roland says he now feels very lucky to be an exoneree and have survived. “There’s a lot of people who still are incarcerated who do not get this chance. A lot of these things we won’t know go on inside that space until someone says it, so I do have a responsibility to speak about it because I was there and now I’m out.” Hindsight Bias is on show at the Tanya Bonakdar Gallery in New York until 5 February",Arts/Art and design,‘I have a responsibility to speak about it’: a wrongfully imprisoned artist making art from his ordeal,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/19/i-have-a-responsibility-to-speak-about-it-a-wrongfully-imprisoned-artist-making-art-from-his-ordeal
1/20/2022,"Hello, Warren Murray with you in the name of good morning here is the news.  Boris Johnson has faced a defection by a junior MP and a demand to quit from one of the most senior Tories during a dramatic day in Westminster, with even allies of the prime minister warning the current situation cannot go on. David Davis caused shockwaves when he told Johnson in the Commons: “In the name of God, go.” Tory MPs have estimated that as many as 30 letters may have been submitted of the 54 required to bring about a confidence vote, with more expected to come in after Sue Gray, a senior civil servant, delivers her finding on alleged rule-breaking in Downing Street next week. In Bury South, some constituents want a byelection after Christian Wakeford defected from the Conservatives to Labour because of partygate. In a letter to Johnson, Wakeford said he believed “the policies of the Conservative government that you lead are doing nothing to help the people of my constituency and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse”. ‘What are Republicans for?’ – Joe Biden has spoken of a “winter of peril and possibility” and blasted US Republicans for “a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn’t get anything done”. In only his second solo White House press conference – lasting nearly two hours – Biden said: “One thing I haven’t been able to do so far is get my Republican friends to get in the game at making things better in this country … What are Republicans for, what are they for? Name me one thing they’re for.” Referring to the leader of the Republicans’ obstructionist Senate minority, the president insisted: “I actually like Mitch McConnell. We like one another. But he has one straightforward objective: make sure that there’s nothing I do that makes me look good, in his mind, with the public at large … I think that the fundamental question is, ‘What’s Mitch for?’” Biden suggested his biggest mistake had been underestimating the radicalisation of the Republican party under Donald Trump. He told the story of five Republican senators who privately told him they agreed with him but told him “Joe, if I do it, I’ll get defeated in a primary.” Student watchdog to police course value – More than 60,000 full-time students in England are doing degrees at institutions that could be punished for low quality and poor value for money. The Office for Students (OfS) has said 80% of students should continue past their first year and 75% complete their degree if universities and colleges want to avoid being sanctioned. Under proposed rules, institutions could also be investigated and penalised by the OfS if fewer than 60% of their graduates go on to work in what it classifies as skilled employment. There are another 150,000 part-time undergraduates at institutions that may not meet its requirements, says the OfS. The rules are being put out for consultation. Alcohol lessons funded by alcohol – Schools are using “misleading and biased” information funded by the alcohol industry to teach pupils as young as nine about drinking, according to a study by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Academics said the materials “portray alcohol as a normal consumer product to impressionable young minds”. They analysed materials put together by Drinkaware for Education, Smashed, and Talk About Alcohol. Teachers in thousands of UK schools employ their lesson plans, factsheets and films. Drinkaware has removed the materials concerned from its website, saying it was out of date. The Alcohol Education Trust and Diageo, which sponsors Smashed, defended their programmes and said underage drinking in the UK was falling. GM crops ‘have not delivered much’ – Research into the gene editing of plants in the UK will become easier under new rules brought forward by the government. Ministers have repeatedly voiced support for genetic modification as an aid to modernising farming and reducing its environmental impact. Campaigners have expressed concern: Pat Thomas, the director of Beyond GM, said “farmers don’t really want to grow genetically engineered crops and citizens don’t want to eat them … After 35 years of use, genetically engineered crops have not delivered much in terms of real value and they have largely been a distraction from more meaningful discussions about what kind of food system we want and need to transition to.” But Prof Nick Talbot from the Sainsbury Laboratory in Norwich said it would “produce nutritious crops requiring much lower fertiliser inputs and with greater resilience”. ‘I’ve read every Marvel comic’ – Did Dark Reign foresee Trump?

Manchester United rode their luck in the first half, but were ruthless in the second to continue their push for the top four, beating their hosts Brentford three goals to one, while it was Leicester 2-3 Spurs at the King Power Stadium. The Women’s Ashes are getting under way in Hobart against a backdrop of off-field issues for both England and Australia. More than two-thirds of male football fans harbour hostile, sexist or misogynistic attitudes towards women’s sport, a study led by Durham University claims. Progressive opinions among men were strongly represented but not as common as hostility and sexism. The study was set in the context of increased visibility of women’s sport in recent years. Asian stock markets have been on the rise after China cut interest rates to shore up flagging economic growth and Japan reported a double-digit rise in exports.

A pound is bringing $1.362 and €1.200 at time of writing. Boris Johnson’s tenuous situation warrants another separate round-up of today’s front pages, which we summarise as follows. The Guardian splashes with “‘In the name of God, go’: Tory anger builds as Boris Johnson clings on”. The Mirror too goes with the Davis quote. Johnson “hanging by a thread”, it writes, above the headline “In the name of God, go”. And the Metro’s take is “In the name of God GO!” squeezed between pictures of Davis and Johnson. The Mail splashes with “Boris and Carrie’s baby hit by Covid”, reporting that six-week-old Romy was badly ill but is now on the mend. Above that a story dismisses the “narcissistic rabble of Tory MPs” trying to topple the PM – and tells Davis “In the name of God, grow up!”. The Express follows a similar sentiment with its lead: “In the name of party unity, go … and back the PM!” The Times has “PM fights on as plotters pull back from the brink” – it says the prime minister has been granted a reprieve by MPs plotting to oust him as concern builds that the Gray inquiry will be more critical of the prime minister than expected. The Telegraph leads with Johnson’s defiance, “Johnson: I won’t quit if rebels force vote”. The Sun plays with the theme of the so-called pork pie plotters, “As our Bojo pork pie chart shows ...” it writes, underneath the headline “Battling PM crust ahead” and a shot of a pie sliced up according to the pressing issues of the day. The FT splashes with “Johnson buys time after defection to Labour rallies restive Tory MPs”. The i paper has a similar feel with “Johnson clings on to power … for now”.
