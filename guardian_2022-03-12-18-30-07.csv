3/12/2022,"UK businesses reliant on fuel are braced for plummeting profits, as prices at the pump hit yet another record this week, with the cost of petrol topping £1.60 a litre for the first time. Unleaded petrol hit £1.61 a litre on Thursday, having risen by 8p in a week, while diesel reached £1.70 a litre, as wholesale prices for oil remained close to all-time highs after western countries announced bans on Russian energy exports. The RAC has urged the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to cut VAT on fuel, as its figures show the cost of filling an average tank of petrol is at almost £88 while diesel has gone over £92. Meanwhile, companies are struggling with how to remain profitable as one of their biggest expenses grows ever larger. Jonny Pattenden, the managing director of York-based courier JP Transport, says he is struggling to pay his staff as fuel prices surge. Since 2019, Pattenden’s fleet of nine vans moves everything from car parts to commercial waste, and runs an express courier service. “In less than a year, fuel prices have jumped from £1.16 to £1.61. Because I cannot pass these costs on to our customers, I am having to swallow about 37% of my profit margin. It’s becoming really hard to keep my drivers on,” he says. On top of high vehicle maintenance costs, the price of keeping the engines running may be enough to put him out of business. “The cost of living has gone through the roof. We are also being squeezed more on clean air zones in major northern cities – this is adding £40 to the average cost of a typical delivery journey. “The government have the chance to release the stress on us, by cutting VAT and fuel duty by 40% for two years,” says Pattenden, who has started a petition for the cause that has amassed 50,000 signatures. Andrew Halliday, the managing director of Safeguard Coaches, a family-owned regional bus and coach company serving Surrey and Hampshire, says the price rise has reversed the small gains the firm had made after a dismal couple of years as the pandemic hit business. Last year Safeguard received government support through the bus recovery grant, but this wound down in September – before the oil price surge began to bite. “Our revenues plummeted as rider numbers fell during the pandemic, so the grant helped us survive,” Halliday says. “Passenger numbers are returning, though are still not at pre-pandemic levels. “But now, with the rise in fuel costs, we are back in the same position that we were in before the grant. “We are expecting a huge hit to our bottom line. Typically we would buy 30,000 litres at about £1.50 a litre. But with petrol prices climbing, we are braced for our normal spend to increase by up to £10,000.” He says raising fares is not an option, because the firm is trying to win back the customers that fell away during the pandemic, but hopes the increased costs of running a car will encourage people to “give the bus a go”. Nationwide bus operators use hedged fuel to cope with the risks of a volatile market. But Halliday says this is harder for his small operation and together with Album, a group of small bus company managers he vice-chairs, he is working to pile pressure on the government to act. The high energy costs, which are forecast to continue, are also raising fears for driver firms serving patients and vulnerable people. Hats Group relies on fuel for its essential services: taking children with special educational needs to school, transporting patients to hospitals and mental health facilities and relocating refugees. Richard Hancock, the chief executive of Hats Group, says because there are no protections against fuel cost increases in its public sector contracts, the burden can be on it to absorb the loss. “We are not transporting people for fun – they need us and we cannot let them down. We are calling for state help with the petrol hike, which is adding up to 25% to our fuel costs, in the same way as furlough.” To soften the blow and reduce unnecessary fuel usage, the company is carrying out daily checks on car maintenance and making sure the right size vehicle is assigned for each journey. It has also brought in driving assessors to improve driving style. “I’m hopeful that we will adjust, but these measures go only so far,” Hancock says. “We can’t change the aerodynamics of a 16-seater vehicle. We would like to expand our services but these rising fuel costs are limiting our dreams.”",News/Business,‘We expect a huge hit’: UK companies struggle as fuel costs soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/12/uk-companies-fuel-prices-petrol-diesel-prices
3/12/2022,"Brian McKeever was already a Winter Paralympics legend for Canada, but he sealed it on Saturday morning with a third gold of these Beijing Games, his 16th career gold and 20th Paralympics medal overall. The 42-year-old skier won the men’s vision impaired middle distance cross-country race at the Zhangjiakou National Biathlon centre. At his sixth Games, incredibly he now hasn’t lost an individual race at a Paralympics since 2006. That 16th gold puts him equal with Germany’s para alpine skier Gerd Schönfelder as the person with the most Paralympics golds. On the slopes at the Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Centre it was another family celebration for Austria’s Aigner sisters, as Veronika Aigner took gold in the women’s visually impaired slalom, guided by her older sister Elisabeth. Younger sister Barbara Aigner took silver, ahead of Slovakian Alexandra Rexova. All of the medallists were teenagers. Britain’s Menna Fitzpatrick, who was attempting to defend her title from Pyeongchang, finished fourth, a frustrating 0.45 seconds off the podium, a gap which afterwards she told Channel 4 “you can lose within a gate, within milliseconds”. She praised the Aigner sisters and said that the standard of competition had vastly increased over the last four years. Teammate Millie Knight came eighth, and afterwards revealed that she had been carrying a foot injury throughout the Games. In good spirits she joked that “Slalom is something that I really struggle with, I’m really bad at it, but it was so much fun.” There was a sad note though when her guide Brett Wilde announced that after six years and four Paralympic medals he was returning to Navy service and it would be the end of their partnership. “It’s been amazing,” he said. “I’ve lived the dream for six years.” Knight said: “It has just been the most incredible years together, and we’ve gone through the toughest times and the best times. It’s going to be a very difficult act to follow to find a new guide who’s up to Brett’s standards.” In the women’s sitting slalom, Shona Brownlee of Britain finished ninth, despite suffering a fall on her opening run. Anna-Lena Forster of Germany successfully defended her title from Pyeongchang. Sweden’s Ebba Arsjö recovered sufficiently from what had looked like a nasty crash on the slopes yesterday to dominate the women’s standing slalom, and win the event from Zhang Mengqiu of China by over five seconds. In the cross-country skiing, there were yet more medals for China as the middle-distance sitting event for women went to Yang Hongqiong, and Mao Zhongwu took the gold in the men’s race. Oksana Master finished with a silver in the women’s event to become the most decorated US Paralympics cross-country skier. In the women’s standing middle-distance race, Ukraine’s Oleksandra Kononova scored what could be a crucial victory for the final medal table. Her time of 43:01.2 meant she edged out Natalie Wilkie of Canada by just 1.9 seconds, and that was Ukraine’s tenth gold of these games. Canada lie third in the medal table with eight golds. China are way in front of every other nation though, both in terms of gold medals – they have 17 – and in medals overall. China’s total of 57 medals equates to nearly a quarter of all the medals that have been available in Beijing. The nation had previously only ever won one Winter Paralympics medal in five appearances since they first sent a team to Salt Lake City in 2002. That one medal had been gold in the wheelchair curling in Pyeongchang, and the Chinese team successfully defended their title in the final action in Beijing’s “Ice cube” with an 8-3 victory over Sweden in the final. Away from the sport, International Paralympics Committee (IPC) president Andrew Parsons defended the decision to expel Russia and Belarus from the Games saying: “No one can be happy with the outcome to not allow anyone. Any reason is not good. We don’t like when politics mix with sports, but we have our limits.” Saturday was the last full programme of these Winter Paralympics. Sunday will feature the gold medal match for para ice hockey between Canada and the US, three men’s para Alpine slalom races, and two relays in Nordic cross-country. Athletes will then gather at the Bird’s Nest stadium once more for the closing ceremony, which is at noon UK time.",Sport/Sport,Winter Paralympics: Canada’s Brian McKeever wins record 16th career gold,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/winter-paralympics-canadas-brian-mckeever-wins-record-16th-career-gold
3/12/2022,"Some of the poorest people in the UK will “simply starve or freeze,” as a result of rocketing energy prices, consumer expert Martin Lewis has warned, as he urged Rishi Sunak to take action in his spring statement. Lewis said energy bills for an average household, already set to rise to £1,971 in April, could hit £3,000 in October, when the regulator Ofgem next sets the price cap. “That’s my conservative guess: not the worst case,” he said. “I think people are going to feel worse than they have for a long time this year. When your energy bill comes in and it’s £3,000 for a year instead of £800, nobody feels good.” In an interview with the Guardian, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website gave a stark assessment of the potential effects of such a rapid increase, when many families are already struggling, and inflation is running at a 30-year high. “When you start to have absolute poverty, which is what we’re going to be talking about with this, when you start to have panic, and a nihilistic feeling of the future, when our charity services start to be swamped … then I think you have to get to the point where you have to question what the impact on wider society is, because you know that extreme poverty causes civil unrest,” he said. “I hope we are not there yet, and I hope we won’t get there,” he added, but called on Sunak to offer, “something that gives people peace of mind that they will survive – and I use that language deliberately”. The chancellor announced a package of measures last month to soften the blow of surging energy costs, including a £150 council tax rebate for homes in bands A to D, and a £200 discount on bills in October, which will be repaid with higher bills in future years. Sunak is holding the line against making that scheme more generous when he gives his spring statement on 23 March. Lewis – who has been critical of the £200 rebate, which he calls a “loan-not-loan” – urged him to go further, given the renewed increase in prices since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which will feed into the October energy price cap. The Treasury argues that it is unclear how much more the energy price cap will rise in October, allowing Sunak time to take further action later in the year if needed – but Lewis said given the scale of concern among consumers now, called for “forward guidance” from the chancellor. “We do not need wholesale plans and costings – we need the commitment that something will be done, and the scale of help for the individual.” He argued that the chancellor’s first priority must be “those people who will simply starve or freeze because of this. And that is not exaggeration.”. Lewis said a recent phone-in on his Radio 5 live show, in which members of the public discussed what they were doing to cope with the rising cost of living, had reduced him to tears. “I had so many people cutting back on food, and saying, ‘I’m prioritising kids’ food rather than my own’,” he said. He said the government would also come under pressure from middle-earners, who will still be able to put food on the table – but for whom the squeeze will be a “massive lifestyle hit”. Lewis, who has interviewed Sunak several times, said he had been “genuinely quite impressed” on meeting him, and rejected the idea that he doesn’t understand the concerns of low-income households – but urged the chancellor to ditch his ideological attachment to balancing the books. “My call to him would be, I’m afraid you’re asking people to suck it up, and I think they do need to suck some of it up, but I think maybe chancellor if you could suck up some of your ideology and get it sorted.” He added: “If I were a Tory MP, especially if I were a ‘red wall’ MP, I would be saying ‘you have to nip this in the bud, chancellor’, because this is going to be catastrophic for those people. We told them that life will get better. And manifestly they’re seeing it getting worse.” Setting out the government’s plans earlier this week to phase out Russian energy imports, the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, suggested the British public were prepared to “endure hardships in solidarity with the heroic efforts that the people of Ukraine are making”. But Lewis argues it is important to be clear that much of the cost of living crisis originated before the invasion – though it has been exacerbated by it. “I am worried about an over-simplistic narrative that uses this as a convenient, catchy reason for what is happening,” he said. Separately, the TUC warned that energy bills were set to rise at least 14 times faster than wages this year. The union organisation said its analysis showed that gas and electricity bills were on course to increase by 54% when the price cap set by Ofgem changes in April, but average weekly wages will go up by 3.75%. It estimated that record high energy prices could wipe out the entire value of pay rises this year. The TUC says those on low incomes will be hit hardest by sky-rocketing bills, as years of weak wage growth and benefit cuts leave working families “badly exposed” to the cost of living crisis. The TUC estimated that since 2010 energy bills have risen at twice the speed of average wages.",Lifestyle/Money,"Huge UK energy bills would cause some to ‘starve or freeze’, Martin Lewis warns",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/12/uk-energy-bills-martin-lewis-warns-extreme-poverty
3/12/2022,"Films about dysfunctional families often call to mind Tolstoy’s line from the opening of Anna Karenina: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” It struck me that the opposite might be true watching this thoughtful, gentle debut from the Portuguese visual artist Catarina Vasconcelos: a lyrical, introspective love letter to her family, gorgeously shot on 16mm. It’s a kind of fictionalised art documentary that for the first hour or so is essentially about Vasconcelos’s grandparents’ life together. It begins with her elderly grandfather Henrique (played by José Manuel Mendes) moving into residential care. In voiceover Henrique talks tenderly to his wife, Beatriz, who died of a stroke in 1984. He was a sailor by trade, away at sea for long stretches of married life; he missed births and milestones, and didn’t meet one of his daughters until she was four. We watch a dramatisation of their marriage; Beatriz talks as well; so too do other members of the family, including their eldest son Jacinto, the director’s father. To her family Beatriz is a tree, a practical woman with deep roots. For her, the children are like birds, who will fly away in time. This poetic voiceover is pierced with an ache of longing and loss. And it’s a film of extraordinary, beautifully composed images, each one like a painting itself: the strong capable hands of the family’s maid cutting a squash or closeups of the veins on a leaf. In the second section, Vasconcelos focuses on the loss of her own mother in 2003. In a tremendously moving scene, she keeps on screen a photo taken at her birth, the blissful moment her mother saw her for the first time. Over the top, her dad talks about watching her at 17 arriving at hospital to find her mother dead. The film isn’t really concerned with any bigger truths or issues but it will no doubt be treasured by the Vasconceloses; others may feel that it is a long time to watch the story of someone else’s family, however gently and poetically told.  The Metamorphosis of Birds is released on 11 March in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Metamorphosis of Birds review – thoughtful and gentle essay on longing and loss,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/07/the-metamorphosis-of-birds-review-a-lyrical-love-letter-to-family
3/12/2022,"The cost of living crisis is hitting the UK’s motorists hard, with each day seeming to bring news of a record high for fuel prices. Many motorists are already shelling out well over £1,000 a year to fill their tanks, and most commentators believe prices will continue to push upwards in the coming days, and that petrol may evenhit £2 a litre. It is a worrying time for those reliant on their vehicle but there are things you can do to save money, ranging from small changes in the way you drive to being savvy about where you fill up and how you pay. Official data published on Tuesday revealed that UK motorists were hit by the steepest weekly rise in fuel prices in more than 18 years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the average price of a litre of unleaded petrol went up by 3.7p between 28 February and 7 March, to just under 153p. Over the same period, diesel prices increased by 5.2p to an average of 158.6p a litre. That means the cost of filling up a typical 55-litre family car had gone up by more than £2 in only a week. The rises have continued as the week has gone on. The RAC said that by Wednesday, after the UK’s announcement that it will phase out Russian oil imports, petrol and diesel had risen to 159.6p and 167.4p. It is all a far cry from May 2020, when the average price of a litre of unleaded dipped below 105p. The AA reckons pump prices will continue to go up in the next few days, and some experts expect diesel prices to rise at a faster rate, as the UK reportedly gets 15-20% of its supplies from Russia. A few filling stations have already breached the £2 a litre of diesel barrier. However, there is a sliver of good news that will counter some of that extra cost. “We are moving from winter to spring, which means engines don’t have to work so hard, and more daylight driving means the burden of headlights, wipers and heaters is reduced,” the AA says. That, plus employing some simple eco-driving techniques, should improve fuel efficiency by about three extra miles a gallon. Roughly that is the equivalent of a 9p-a-litre saving at the pump, it adds. The research website NimbleFins recently put the average annual running cost for a car in the UK, excluding purchase and depreciation, at £1,977. It said almost half of that – £961 a year – was the bill for petrol or diesel. In second place, at £484 a year, was car insurance, while repairs and servicing came in third at £273. There are changes people can make that will have a huge impact on their spending, such as switching to an electric vehicle or one that is cheaper to run, but these will almost certainly involve hefty upfront costs. Instead, we have focused on quick fixes that do not involve a big outlay. This includes things such as driving smoothly (as a rough rule, keep the revs between 1,500 and 2,500rpm if it’s a petrol engine, and 1,200 and 2,000rpm if it’s diesel, says the consumer body Which?), avoiding excessive braking and acceleration, changing up a gear early, and sticking to the speed limit: the AA and others say that driving on the motorway at 80mph can use up to 25% more fuel than driving at 70mph. The AA has a useful webpage on driving more efficiently, and there are a number of videos on YouTube that have been put up by organisations such as driving schools. A litre of petrol at supermarkets typically costs a few pence less than fuel at other forecourts, according to Which?. “The best prices are often found at supermarket forecourts and, when filling up, remember that most cars get little benefit from expensive premium unleaded petrol,” says Adam French from Which?. The money-saving website Wethrift says that while supermarket fuel usually comes from the same refineries as the big brands such as Shell or Esso, these brands will usually add special additives to their own fuels in order to improve efficiency and performance, which is why they tend to cost more. However, Which? says petrol from a supermarket filling station “is of the same quality” as that from other locations. From time to time, supermarkets incentivise shoppers by offering money off fuel when they spend a certain amount on groceries. Last month, Morrisons was running an offer where customers spending £40 or more in-store got a voucher worth 7p off a litre of fuel. Tesco and Sainsbury’s run similar time-limited offers, so keep an eye out for these. Don’t forget about the supermarket loyalty schemes. For example, with a Tesco Clubcard you can earn one point for every £2 spent when you fill up at the supermarket’s petrol stations. You can spend Clubcard vouchers on fuel at all Tesco petrol stations at face value. BP’s rewards programme is called BPme, and you earn one point for every litre of regular fuel, two points for every litre of Ultimate fuel, and one point for each £1 spent in-store. You can redeem points on fuel and shop products (200 points equals £1 off). Shell’s scheme is called Shell Go+. Points are called visits and when you spend £10 or more on fuel or £2 or more in-store you will earn one. Reach 10 and you get a money-off “fuel reward”. Texaco has Star Rewards: when you buy one litre of fuel, you get one point worth 1p. When you hit 500 points, they can be redeemed for a £5 voucher, making this one of the more generous schemes. Meanwhile, Esso Nectar allows you to collect Nectar points on fuel purchases at participating Esso petrol stations. You earn one point for every litre bought (you can also collect points on items you buy in the shop), and 300 points gets you 5p off a litre of fuel. The US bank Chase’s newish UK current account comes with a debit card that lets you earn 1% cashback on everyday purchases for a year, including petrol. American Express offers some of the best-paying cashback credit cards. Its Platinum Cashback Everyday card gives new customers 5% cashback on purchases (up to £100) for the first three months. After that, it’s up to 1% cashback, depending on how much you spend. But not everywhere takes Amex, and be wary about racking up debt. The PetrolPrices website and app let you see where the best price for fuel is in your local area. You have to create an account (it’s free), then it shows you the cheapest or nearest petrol stations. This week it was claiming it could help some drivers of petrol cars save £225 a year. Many local news websites also provide updates on the cheapest places to fill up. If you have got a trip coming up – you are driving to visit family for a few days, say – it’s probably a no-brainer in the current climate to fill up when you arrive at your destination rather than waiting until you set off home. With prices rising by the day, it could be more expensive when it is time to leave. “Incorrect tyre pressure is not only unsafe, it could be costing a small fortune in fuel,” says Richard Bruce, the motoring director at Halfords. The lower the tyre pressure, the more fuel a car will use to push them around, so keep them pumped up appropriately to reduce consumption. As well as showing you the quickest route to your destination, they can also work in real time and help you avoid getting stuck in jams. Some will even select the most economical route to help you avoid fuel-gobbling obstacles such as large hills, says Nick Drewe at Wethrift. Google Maps has been rolling out eco-friendly routeing where, in addition to showing the fastest route, it will also display the one that is the most fuel efficient (if it doesn’t happen to also be the fastest). Are you carrying around loads of unnecessary stuff? Maybe find another home for it because the heavier your car, the more fuel you will need to move it around. Similarly, remove roof boxes and bike racks if they are not being used much (or at all). For many this will be tricky because of where they live or work or their family situation but some are already cutting back on shopping and recreational trips by car. One leading campaigner this week said he expects mileage to fall by as much as 30% in 2022. Some may want to investigate carsharing – AKA lift-sharing – for getting to work. Liftshare calls itself the UK’s biggest carsharing community, so it’s a good place to start if you work somewhere where there are lots of other companies. If you work for a big employer, its intranet might be good place to find a sharer. As well as reducing your petrol consumption, you should check you are getting the best deal on insurance when it is time to renew your policy. The good news is that, according to the industry body the Association of British Insurers, the average cost of motor cover in 2021 was at a six-year low, but make sure you shop around rather than assuming the policy you are being offered is the best deal.",Lifestyle/Money,Petrol prices are soaring – here’s how you can save money on running a car,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/12/petrol-prices-are-soaring-heres-how-you-can-save-money-on-running-a-car
3/12/2022,"The great promise of virtual reality lies in its potential to replicate otherwise unattainable experiences. And few in the physical world can match the experiences of Alex Honnold, the American rock climber who has distinguished himself with ropeless ascents up some of the world’s most fearsome cliffs. No one had ever completed a “free-solo” climb of El Capitan in Yosemite National Park before Honnold famously did so in 2017, a feat that was the subject of an Oscar-winning documentary. Now comes another film about Honnold, one that takes viewers as close they will probably ever get to the hair-raising exploits that have made him a rock star. The new virtual reality series, Alex Honnold: The Soloist VR, invites you to tag along as he embarks on free-solo climbs in the Italian and French Alps. Strap on a headset, and you’re immersed in a panorama of sky, snow and rock. Crane your head upward to watch as Honnold navigates his way to the summit. Peer over your shoulder, and you’re met with a sweeping view of wilderness. Look down, and – well, maybe don’t look down. The two-part series, which was released last week, offers up plenty of mind-blowing scenery. But it could be difficult viewing for some, and not just because it’s only available on Meta’s line of Quest VR headsets. “I think for some people it might be one of the most intense things they’ve ever watched,” Honnold tells the Guardian. “Even when I’m watching I’m like, ‘This is a lot.’ I did the actual climbs and it still feels pretty intense.” Honnold said even his family of climbers has only been able to consume the two half-hour episodes in “small doses.” “They’re really struggling to watch the whole film because it really puts them there,” he says. “I don’t know, it’s almost too much for them.” The Soloist was directed by Jonathan Griffith, a filmmaker who specializes in shooting mountain sports. An alpinist himself, Griffith says virtual reality is the “most powerful way to bring people into my world of climbing.” “I really fell in love with VR because the whole thing that motivates me in my work is to bring people into my world of the high mountains – the Himalayas, the Alps or wherever,” Griffith says. “You’re putting humans in these alien looking worlds, and it’s completely crazy. I love taking photos of that and sharing them with the world.” Griffith wisely eschewed music in the production, allowing viewers to take in all the raw, ambient sounds of Honnold’s climbs. At the end of the first episode, with Honnold on a free solo climb in the Dolomites, he pauses to tie his shoe. And suddenly, it’s just you and him on the precipice, both sharing a sublime view of the Italian Alps amid the unmatched stillness of nature. If you can avoid any bouts of vertigo – and you have access to the necessary hardware – the series is worth checking out for moments like that. “The thing that I love about soloing is being in these incredible places and having these powerful experiences,” Honnold says. “In the VR film, the scenes are long enough so the viewer can look around a little bit and get a taste of what I love about those places.” Honnold, 36, is still feeling the aftereffects of his triumph at El Capitan. The historic, ropeless climb of Yosemite’s famous monolith of granite was chronicled in Free Solo, which won an Oscar for best documentary in 2019 and brought Honnold even more fame. In January, he joined a long line of celebrities to make cameos on the Showtime series Billions. Honnold says he gets recognized in public more since the release of the documentary, which has also generated more commercial opportunities and increased exposure to his solar energy foundation. “Basically everything has been turned up quite a bit,” he says. “But at the heart of it, [the fame] hasn’t really changed the things that matter the most. I’m still climbing five days a week. I’m still spending my time on projects that are exciting to me.” Free Solo served as a window into what makes Honnold tick, and what it’s like to be in his orbit. Audiences saw his singularity of focus in his push to conquer El Cap, as well as the anxiety the pursuit brought to his friends. Throughout the film, Honnold wrestles with his personal life, openly wondering if a budding romance will compromise his climbing goals. In one scene, he and his girlfriend, Sanni McCandless, discuss whether a family might cause him to recalibrate his capacity for risk. Since then, Honnold and McCandless have gotten married. Last month, they welcomed the birth of their first child. “I was always expecting to go through the full range of adulthood at some point,” Honnold says. “I always wanted to have a family eventually. I always wanted a stable relationship. It’s all according to plan.” Speaking by phone as he holds his newborn daughter, June, Honnold says that his expanded family hasn’t caused him to rein in his ambitions, noting that he completed the free-solo climbs for the VR series during his wife’s pregnancy. He didn’t climb for a week following the birth, as June remained in the hospital to receive treatment for now-resolved medical complications. “Now that I’m coming out of that, I’ve actually been feeling heroically strong,” Honnold says. “I wonder if that’s just a byproduct of fatherhood.”",Sport/Sport,Alex Honnold: ‘My new film is almost too much for some people’,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/12/alex-honnold-climbing-the-soloist

3/12/2022,"Arsenal have a great chance against Leicester to further solidify their grip on fourth place. One of Manchester United and Tottenham will lose ground as they face each other on Saturday and West Ham host an Aston Villa side in scintillating form. Mikel Arteta’s side are on a great run of their own and if they are successful then it would be Arsenal’s first run of five league wins since Unai Emery’s mythical 22-game unbeaten streak in 2018. Rather than feeling like a total fluke, though, this appears to be an Arsenal team built on solid foundations, foundations that will be delighted that Jamie Vardy, Emirates menace, is out injured.

The Eddie Howe revolution had yet to gain any momentum with an embarrassing FA Cup defeat at home to Cambridge United adding to the club’s Premier League misery. A run of six wins and a draw from their past seven games has banished any relegation fears and they can now approach the trip to Chelsea with genuine hopes of recording a first win at Stamford Bridge since 2012.

3/12/2022,"Roy Hodgson will be looking for Watford to bounce back quickly from their abject defeat at Wolves on Thursday. The game was over after 20 minutes and, unless Hodgson can coax better performances from the defence, their season will be over soon too. Watford may be only four points from the last safe spot but Everton and Burnley have multiple games in hand over them so they need to be aiming for winning at all costs against a Southampton side suffering from a dip in form. Watford’s problem is that Ralph Hasenhüttl will see them as the perfect side to be aggressive against so they can correct their slump. A huge FA Cup quarter-final awaits next week and what better way to build up to it than a spirit-boosting thrashing of Watford.

3/12/2022,"Why would anyone be interested in authors? It’s not as if they’re a charismatic, or even good-looking, breed. I mean that lovingly. Having spent my life in books, publishing, editing, reviewing, teaching and writing them, I can exclusively reveal that most of the writers I’ve met are exactly as you’d expect; formerly Indoor Children, socially awkward little weirdos who, with diligence and too much time alone, become thin-skinned pasty show-offs, prone to backache, voracious for praise. If we’d been attractive, confident teenagers, we’d have spent our free time taking drugs and snogging, not fancying Keats and reading Orwell at lunch. OK, that was me. But creative types do attract curiosity. We want to know not only how and where they work (Book Event Question no 1: “Do you write with a pen?”), but what they’re like as parents, lovers, friends: writers behaving badly. Marriages, too, are fascinating to the nosy. There is little more gripping than a really molecular insight into how a relationship works, or fails; the public flirtations, the discreet acts of cruelty. So what could be more delicious than the secrets of one artist married to another? Think of the famous author couples of the past: Ted and Sylvia, Simone and Jean-Paul, Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard; Colette and Willy; Zelda and F Scott Fitzgerald. Now consider the still-together living couples. What do you notice? Isn’t it an amazing coincidence that we know of so many unhappy dead writer pairs, when almost all the living ones claim to exist in joyous idylls of fruitful kindness and support: plot-chat at breakfast, gouache-y passion, personalised erotic sonnets? My new novel, The Exhibitionist, describes the escalating domestic tension between a pair of visual artists: a female sculptor and a male painter. They are totally fictional; although I read extensively about artist couples – Barbara Hepworth and Ben Nicholson, Jackson Pollock and Lee Krasner, Georgia O’Keeffe and Alfred Stieglitz – it’s not remotely biography. Nor is it memoir: I was married to a writer, but it isn’t our story. Yet the marriage of the Hanrahans, stars of my novel, came from somewhere: my discovery, as I’ve travelled through this world observing other creative couples, of how much competitiveness, egotism and envy can seethe beneath the surface. And I’ve tried to discover what makes for happiness, instead. We’ve all gobbled up articles in which married artists insist: “She’s my first reader”; “He has been enormously supportive”. Well, they would say that, wouldn’t they? Siri Hustvedt and Paul Auster have always claimed a lack of rivalry; Ayelet Waldman and Michael Chabon emphasise their devotion. When Claire Tomalin and Michael Frayn each won in their individual category – biography and fiction, respectively – for the 2003 Whitbread prize, so were in direct competition for the overall award, they joked about throwing bread rolls during the ceremony, and insisted on their mutual pride (Tomalin won). At least one interviewer found it “startling” that people might assume they’d feel anything else. But, based on the confessions I’ve heard, isn’t the opposite more likely? As B, an artist friend, once admitted: “I used to think that if, in an imaginary world, I was phoned up and offered the Turner, I’d turn it down for the sake of my marriage. I just couldn’t face the thought of all her resentment and rage.” Whether the tension arises from the assumption that the woman, usually, will do all the emotional and domestic labour, while still finding time to create, or there’s one partner who, behind closed doors, is the brain-sucker, the coercive controller, these power dynamics undermine so many artists’ domestic worlds, particularly when the junior partner, or protege, begins to catch up. Of course, even the messiest creative relationships start with mutual support: contacts shared, manuscripts strengthened, thrilling dates among the famous. When Lucian Freud, 55, took his lover Celia Paul, 19, to dinner with Frank Auerbach and “a woman”, neither girlfriend spoke, as Paul writes in her memoir: “Two dynamic scintillating men and two silent bewildered and embarrassed women sitting eating olives. It is thought mundane if you do not talk about art or literature or a well-known person.” The Hanrahans’ fictional marriage also begins well, full of sex and encouragement. Lucia, the younger disciple, feels privileged to clean her famous artist lover’s brushes. But, when she starts having small successes of her own, Ray Hanrahan, now her husband, is consumed by envy, monitoring the plaster dust under her fingernails, accusing her of flirting for advancement, until Lucia’s main task is shoring up his ego, dodging acquaintances who might praise her in his earshot, sabotaging professional opportunities of her own. Ray, like many competitive spouses, annexes possible subjects: “mothers, sons, sex, nature, time”. Even if Lucia could dodge the forbidden themes, her fear of being good, even overshadowing him, makes work impossible. So often there is one spouse who hoovers up ideas while refusing to do any actual, well, Hoovering (Book Event Question no 2: “Where do you get your ideas?”). Creativity requires peace: to let one’s mind roam, make connections, dredge specks of gold from the slurry. Few couples admit to an unfair division of emotional and domestic labour; why should artists be any different? For Lucia, the early days of motherhood are a creative wasteland of optician’s appointments and school books, buying Ray’s godchildren presents, chopping carrots. He trots off to his studio; she tries to do a bit of sculpting at the kitchen table. Similarly, my friend P, a nonfiction star, was expected to host huge weekend parties for her novelist partner’s pals. “I’ll just pop off,” he’d announce, “and do a couple of hours’ work.” “How,” she asks now, “could he shut out everything and concentrate? I couldn’t, and, whenever I did have time, his tap-tap-tapping would drive me insane.” Lockdown has intensified this, like everything else. It’s bad enough for Lucia, who can hear Ray yelling “Lunchtime!” through their studio wall, but what about when two artists have to share space? Picture Elaine de Kooning, trying to shut out the histrionic rage of Bill, whistling and swearing while they painted in the same room; do you imagine that, once they had separate studios, the noise in her head stopped? Sexual jealousy, too, can cramp one’s style. Simone de Beauvoir managed to avoid domesticity by living with Sartre in a hotel, while Jean-Paul, who was definitely Not Safe in Taxis, explained that jealousy is the enemy of freedom. The central image of Paula Rego’s The Dance, originally conceived as women jumping in the air, could be seen as her husband Victor dancing with an unknown woman, while Rego dances alone. We’ll never know how many potential artists prioritised their genius spouse. In the short story Material, Alice Munro describes writer husbands as “such talented incapable men, who must be looked after for the sake of the words that will come out of them”. What works of genius might have been lost because Véra Nabokov was cutting up Vlad’s food and folding his umbrella? Sometimes, one partner accepts their role as handmaiden, midwife to the star; like my friend R who once begged her own editor to publish her partner, whose book had been turned down. As Annie Leibovitz said of her lover Susan Sontag: “I felt like a person who is taking care of a great monument.” Sheila Girling, artist wife of Anthony Caro, said: “I had to give all my creativity to Tony ... I thought one of us has got to get there, so it had better be Tony.” In Ninth Street Women, Mary Gabriel describes how both Krasner and Pollock believed in him, saw his career as their joint project, but Krasner’s only champion was herself. Might this explain the success of those intriguing couples where one is much more famous? Margaret Atwood’s late husband was referred to as “the writer Graeme Gibson”. Dave Eggers and Chabon are married to talented novelists, Vendela Vida and Waldman, respectively, but whereas the menfolk are treated like rock star cult heroes, their wives are praised more modestly. Stephen King’s wife Tabitha and Jonathan Franzen’s first wife, Valerie Cornell, are also writers. In her essay, “Envy”, Franzen’s now partner, Kathryn Chetkovich, notoriously describes her obsession with his unbearable success and self-belief, yet they are still together. Domestic chores intrude on creative reverie; what is far more destructive is fretting about the fragile ego sitting upstairs, suspicious of one’s motives, paranoid about being overlooked. Once half of a couple reaches that stage, every day will bring drama and accusations. As Howard wrote in her radically frank memoir Slipstream, her marriage to Amis was corroded by his “accusation, resentment and plain dislike ... conciliation makes the conciliated more aware of the effectiveness of their bad behaviour, so consequently they increase it.” Onlookers always make allowances. Aren’t artists meant to misbehave? Until recently, men were expected to find professional imbalance unbearable, to feel emasculated by dusting. In same-sex couples, bullying and coercion is even more taboo; no one wants to sound homophobic or unsophisticated by asking: “Is that ... OK?” But, eventually, people start to comment. Sontag, 16 years Leibowitz’s senior, became so abusively narcissistic that friends avoided them. Like Pollock, Ray causes havoc at his wife’s private views; when my friend K was shortlisted for an award, his partner refused to enter the hall with him, so distressed was he never to have been shortlisted for it himself. Eventually, what choice did Krasner, or Howard, or B or P or K, have? They left. As Elizabeth Strout writes in My Name Is Lucy Barton, “if I stayed in my marriage I would not write another book, not the kind I wanted to ... I will grab myself and hurl onward through life, blind as a bat, but on I go!” Imagine the money I’d make doing that tattoo backstage at the Edinburgh festival. Midlife is a time of change, doubt, crisis. For some, the desire for a life, and career, beyond marriage also revives. What Toni Morrison called “the wonderful liberation of being divorced” can be, despite the gothic chaos involved, transformative for the formerly squashed. As Deborah Levy wrote, “partners become resentful, angry and depressed ... [the writer] receives the fatal message that she must conceal her talents and abilities in order to be loved.” When Nicole Krauss and Jonathan Safran Foer split up, Krauss wrote Forest Dark, a novel about a New York writer called Nicole with a failing marriage. Never divorce a writer. (Book Event Question no 3: “This is more a comment than a question ...”) However demonstrably badly one party has behaved, if they are left their response can be savage, and public. Interestingly, although in fiction we’re used to the idea of the Unreliable Narrator, in real life we’re amazingly willing to believe one side and dismiss the other, swallowing the most grisly lies. When writer Elizabeth Dewberry (b1962) left Robert Olen Butler (b1945) for Ted Turner (b1938 – oh, Elizabeth), Butler sent his contact list a famously deranged email, confiding that she couldn’t “step out of the shadow” of his Pulitzer, although “everyone has heard me proclaim my sincere high regard for her as an artist”. It ends, sadly all too soon, with “I will keep my house ... I will keep virtually everything.” Claire Bloom’s post-Roth memoir, Leaving a Doll’s House, revealed his lists of her perceived crimes, his infidelity, manipulation and financial vengefulness; Zoë Heller called it “a lighthouse to stage-struck girls”. But the impressed and naive often head straight for the rocks, then are punished by those who should know better. When Joyce Maynard wrote about her affair with JD Salinger, begun when she was 18 and he 53, she was pilloried. The New York Times called her “indefatigably exhibitionistic”; at a literary festival, “an entire row of writers I respected greatly rose from their seats ... and, as I took the stage, departed the room”. Yet there are exceptions. Tomalin won, and remains with Frayn; clearly they have found a way to negotiate the stress. Katie Kitamura dedicated A Separation to her writer husband, Hari Kunzru. My two closest author friends are married to other writers, successfully – one straight, one gay; one with children, one without. Another pair, T and H, have survived her much greater musical success, I think, because he’s quieter and adores his strong breadwinning wife, while she praises and loves his child-rearing and manly forays into plumbing and housebuilding. I suspect, although selfishly they won’t tell me, that a vigorous sex life also helps. And there are very many happy artist/non-artist combinations; an acquaintance confided that her lawyer husband was happy for her to “be the peacock”; she also mentioned that they’d had sex therapy, but let’s gloss over that. And there’s always the option of career-combining, where a man becomes his writer-wife’s agent or manager, although I should warn you that, among my publishing friends and colleagues, almost nothing was more dreaded than this news. What happens to the Hanrahans? If I tell you it centres on Ray’s long-awaited exhibition, together with Lucia’s own secrets, queer desire and forbidden inspiration, you can leap to your own conclusions. Then double them; it gets messy. Should artists, in any combination, be avoided then? Only if every other marriage you know is happy, sane and wholesome, and chances are ... The truth is that, for every disastrous artist couple, there are many non-creative horrors – but we don’t hear about them. People with sensible jobs are rarely interviewed about their marriages. If only they were. So what is the secret of romantic success, whether you work in exactly the same creative field, or in different ones, or one of you has no artistic ambitions? I think it’s security. However much older or more established your love might be, if they feel threatened by your career they will probably also put you down in public/private, think you’re too friendly/unfriendly to others, undermine. Lonely, sensitive children don’t shed neuroses as they age, but those who try are keepers. Another outlet – gardening, music, screen-printing – seems to help. Perhaps the answer is finding someone who doesn’t see “success” as a pie, to be divided. In every lasting creative union I know, the strength of the relationship seems to rest on the overshadowed partner being sufficiently secure not to take out their issues on the other; feeling valued for their other, domestic, work. Or, to put it another way, being confident enough to say to their impossible partner the magic words: “You’re horrible today, here’s a biscuit.” Perhaps it’s better to look on us as rescue pets, a little trickier than one might wish, like those dogs with “EASILY STARTLED” on their harnesses. We may be easily spooked, likely to snap or drool, but, with gentleness, firm boundaries and no loud noises, we can make lovely companions. Just think carefully before introducing another into the household.  The Exhibitionist is published by Pan Macmillan on Thursday.
