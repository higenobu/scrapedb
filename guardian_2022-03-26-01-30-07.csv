3/26/2022,"The family of a woman killed in the Wiltshire novichok poisonings have expressed concerns that the start of public inquiry hearings into her death is set to be delayed and that and the issue of possible failings by the authorities in protecting her may be held in private. Lawyers for the family of Dawn Sturgess said the current threat posed by Russia to the UK made it even more important that as much of the inquiry be heard in public as possible without compromising national security. At a preliminary inquiry hearing on Friday it emerged that the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who survived the earlier nerve agent attack, had asked to become “core participants”, meaning they can be legally represented. It was made clear that the stories of the three Russians accused of carrying out the poisonings – Denis Sergeev, Alexander Mishkin and Anatoliy Chepiga – would be tested and a UK barrister has been charged with looking at evidence from their point of view. Cathryn McGahey QC, representing the home secretary, Priti Patel, said the Ukraine crisis had contributed to delays in processing and disclosing sensitive information. Michael Mansfield QC, for the Sturgess family, said the delay had been “enormous”, adding: “The original incident affecting their family was in 2018.” He highlighted that one element the government was suggesting should be held in a closed session was whether the authorities took appropriate precautions after the Skripal attack to protect the citizens of the UK. Mansfield said it was particularly important that this element was aired in public given the threat the UK now faced from Moscow. The public inquiry was formally launched by the UK government this month, with the former supreme court judge Lord Hughes chairing it. At the opening of the first preliminary hearing, Hughes said the inquiry would deal with “international politics and complex science”, but he added: “We must not lose sight of the fact that at its heart is the death of a woman who had no international or security life. She was dearly loved.” He said the investigation would be full and thorough, continuing: “The terms of reference raise issues of the utmost gravity, including the allegation of Russian state responsibility for the killing of Ms Sturgess. Recent world events highlight the importance of the conclusions that I reach being as clear and as authoritative as possible.” Hughes said highly classified evidence would be considered in closed sessions but he wanted to hear as much in open court as possible. He expressed concern that it was now unlikely that substantive hearings could begin in February next year, as had been hoped. Sergei Skripal was the target of the initial novichok attack in Salisbury on 4 March 2018. He, Yulia, and a police officer, DS Nick Bailey, were poisoned but survived. In June 2018, Sturgess, 44, and her partner, Charlie Rowley, were poisoned in Amesbury, eight miles north of Salisbury, after he found a fake perfume bottle containing novichok. Rowley recovered but Sturgess died on 8 July that year. A further public hearing may be held in the summer.",News/UK news,Wiltshire novichok victim’s family concerned at public inquiry delay,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/25/wiltshire-novichok-victim-dawn-sturgess-family-concerned-public-inquiry-delay
3/26/2022,"For a nation with four World Cup wins on the résumé, Italy have suffered an unusually large number of widescreen humiliations at the greatest tournament of all. At Mexico 70, they conceded the most famous goal in World Cup history, Carlos Alberto setting the seal on the joint-largest, and certainly most iconic, spanking in a final. Four years earlier, a loss to North Korea led to their getting pelted by tomatoes upon arrival back home, protest registered via the medium of pizza topping. In 1950, they opted to travel to Brazil by boat having been spooked by Superga, then stank the place out and flew home anyway. Diego Maradona ran rings around them, on and off the pitch, at their own party in 1990. Roberto Baggio’s penalty is still climbing over LA. And in 2014 they only narrowly managed to beat Mr Roy’s England. The litany of gaffes, fiascos and faux pas is seemingly endless. To be fair, in the grand karmic scheme of things, the Marco Tardelli celebration alone cancels out all of those historical negatives in one fell swoop. Never mind the four titles. However, the current crop are beginning to ask a little too much spiritual lifting of Marco. Last night in the qualifying play-offs, the Azzurri took 936 shots against North Macedonia, though not very many of them were on target. What happened next was inevitable. Aleksandar Trajkovski sent an injury-time pearler into the bottom left corner, and suddenly everyone was staring at Jorginho, wondering why he couldn’t have stopped jigging around like a harlequin in those group games against Switzerland and slotted at least one of his penalties. Oh Jorginho! There’s a time and a place for the Commedia dell’arte! The shock result, which we all sort of knew was coming, means Italy will miss back-to-back World Cups for the very first time in their history. Any level of surprise is certainly tempered by their frankly abysmal run since winning the thing in 2006: these qualification disasters follow failures to get out of the groups at the 2010 and 2014 finals. It’s all very odd, especially when you factor in the events at Wembley last summer, which if nothing else mean Roberto Mancini still has some credit in the moral bank. “I hope he continues,” said Italian Football Federation chief suit Gabriele Gravina, responding to speculation that Mancini was for the off. “He has a commitment to a project and I hope he can quickly dispose of the waste.” Hey, if Gareth Southgate was allowed to stay in post after failing to get the job done against this shower, then Roberto surely deserves another chance. “A phenomenon when he wants to be” – hacks at Marca are still at it with this backhanded compliment for that “parasite” Gareth Bale, who said it best after finding kryptonite in his feet to fire Wales to a 2-1 win: “They should be ashamed of themselves”. “It’s just as well that Italy weren’t playing the whole of Macedonia!” – David Newton. “I too have an O level in British Constitution. May I be the 1,057th reader to remind Bryan Paisley we do have a constitution, just not a written one. Think of it as being similar to the rules governing VAR – flexible and always changing, and completely lacking in clarity” – Ian Sharp (and 1,056 others). “If Ukraine can’t fulfil their fixture against Scotland, Fifa should let Scotland play off against Wales and then offer Ukraine a guaranteed playoff place for the next World Cup (should they not qualify in the normal way)” – George Paterson. “Having just retired, Jermain Defoe was presumably always a big fan of retirement, even as a young lad, etc etc and so on” – Pete Green.

West Ham have made donations to nine animal welfare charities following the club fine handed out to Kurt Zouma for drop-kicking his pet cat. The FA has ‘solved’ its no-trains logistical crisis for the City-Liverpool semi-final by laying on 100 free buses to ferry fans there for an almost-traditional kick-off time of 3.30pm. “This will ensure that up to 5,000 Liverpool and Manchester City supporters will be able to travel to Wembley Stadium free of charge for their semi-final tie,” blathered an FA suit. The consortiums in the Chelsea beauty contest led by USA!!! USA!! USA! tycoon Todd Boehly and former British Airways suit Sir Martin Broughton are on the shortlist to buy the club. Property Nick Candy is out of the running but happy to consort with the other consortiums.

3/26/2022,"The Oscars are set to unfold on Sunday night with more drama and tension than at any previous point during this year’s awards race. The attendance of a number of key nominees seems uncertain, including Belfast’s Kenneth Branagh and Ciarán Hinds. Both men tested positive for Covid-19 shortly after their appearance at the Baftas 13 days ago and require proof of a negative lateral flow test to secure entry to the Academy Awards. Many in the industry have been reporting a glut of positive cases following numerous ceremonies and parties over the past fortnight. Meanwhile, the recipient of the best picture Oscar – for months considered a lock for The Power of the Dog, Jane Campion’s western starring Benedict Cumberbatch as a repressed rancher – now hangs in the balance. It had been assumed Campion’s film would follow in the tracks of Nomadland, which won the big awards last year. Yet a late surge of momentum for another film directed by a woman threatens to dethrone Campion’s well-funded Netflix epic. Coda, Apple TV+’s first original film, premiered at the Sundance film festival last January and was released in the US in August, to moderate reviews. Yet Sian Heder’s small domestic drama about a hearing-impaired family in a Massachusetts fishing village has rapidly gone from dark horse to frontrunner. The film, which has only been streamed about 375,000 times – by far the fewest of all the best picture nominees – took top prize at the Screen Actors Guild awards last month, followed by victory at the Producers Guild of America awards last Saturday. The PGAs are seen as an especially important bellwether, not only because they mark the final major ceremony before the Oscars but because they too are decided by a preferential vote system. And while The Power of the Dog’s admirers are numerous and passionate, Campion’s film has also been deemed cold and overlong by some Academy members, meaning it is likely to be placed ninth or tenth by many. Heder’s film, meanwhile, an undemanding coming-of-age tale, has fostered considerable warmth and goodwill among the voters, ensuring that even if it isn’t placed first or second on a ballot, it is unlikely to lag far behind. Earlier this week, Joe Biden gave the cast and crew of Coda a tour of the White House; one of the film’s stars reported the president and first lady “loved” its “theme of family authenticity”. Heder was left off the Oscars’ best director shortlist; a snub some voters may be eager to rectify elsewhere. A decade ago, Ben Affleck was similarly excluded from that category; his film, Argo, went on to win best picture. Campion is, however, all but certain to triumph in the director category. Now 67, the New Zealander is the first woman to be nominated twice, and would be only the third to win (following Chloé Zhao in 2021 and Kathryn Bigelow in 2010). Other sure bets include Will Smith in the best actor category for his performance as the father of Venus and Serena Williams in King Richard, and Troy Kotsur in the supporting actor race for Coda. Supporting actress Ariana DeBose looks set to be West Side Story’s highest profile winner for her screen debut. The leading actress category remains less certain. Jessica Chastain’s transformative turn as televangelist Tammy Faye is narrow favourite, but Penélope Cruz (in Pedro Almodóvar’s Parallel Mothers) and Olivia Colman (for Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Lost Daughter) could present potential upsets. The 94th Oscars return to a full-capacity Dolby theatre after last year’s socially distanced ceremony at the Union station in Los Angeles. Ratings for that show dipped more than 50% year on year, and incoming telecast producer Will Packer is aiming to reverse the trend with a show celebrating popular cinemagoing, including a new #FanFavorite award and a performance of the chart-topper We Don’t Walk About Bruno from the Disney film Encanto, despite it not being nominated. Eight craft category prizes will be handed out just before the main show and the speeches will be edited into the official broadcast – a move that has caused upset among many members of the Academy. Three new hosts – Amy Schumer, Wanda Sykes and Regina Hall – are set to oversee proceedings, marking the first time in four years the Academy Awards will have an overall MC. Earlier this week, Schumer expressed eagerness for the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to put in an appearance by video link. He is said to have declined.",Arts/Film,Big winners and top attendees hang in the balance as Oscar night nears,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/25/big-winners-and-top-attendees-hang-in-the-balance-as-oscar-night-nears
3/26/2022,"Conservative leaders insist they are on track for strong results in local elections across England, predicting they will seize control of one of Labour’s longest-held councils, despite many admitting more should be done to ease the “nightmare” of soaring bills. More than a million people are expected to be pushed into absolute poverty after Rishi Sunak’s mini-budget, which has attracted heavy criticism from experts and Tory backbenchers. However, Tory leaders outside London said they did not believe the party would be punished at the polls on 5 May, when local elections take place in England, Wales and Scotland. Elections for the Northern Ireland assembly will take place on the same day. Tory strategists have set their sights on taking control of Sunderland city council for the first time in its 48-year history, in what would represent a headline-grabbing victory for Boris Johnson and a serious blow for Keir Starmer. Antony Mullen, the leader of the Conservatives in Sunderland, said it was “probably likely” that Labour would lose control of the council in six weeks, despite conceding that the chancellor could have done more to protect voters from the cost of living crisis. “One area where it would be good to have seen more would be an increase to universal credit,” he said. “Any intervention he does make will have to be targeted at those who need it most, but when that category of people is widening considerably it becomes an almost unmanageable problem. I wouldn’t be surprised if in April there is more intervention.” Patrick Harley, the Conservative leader of Dudley council, said he was confident the party would make gains, with 24 seats up for grabs in the former “red wall” stronghold. Harley, who runs a pub, said his bills were “just scary” and he would like to see Sunak give a one-off payment to help households through the next couple of months. “It’s a nightmare at the moment. Household bills will inevitably go up and people will have to try to manage as they can and hopefully over the next couple of months we will see a reduction,” he said, adding: “We could always hope for more but in the grand scheme of things he didn’t do a bad job.” In Walsall, the Tory council leader, Mike Bird, said Sunak had “given as much support as he can”. He added: “There are people out there on benefits and they can have more and more and more. Well, there’s a million jobs vacant and some people unfortunately find the benefits system a little more generous than going to work.” However, Adele Warren, a Conservative councillor for one of the poorest wards in Bolton, said she had been contacted by older residents “who didn’t feel [Sunak] went far enough”. Warren said the cost of living would affect how people voted: “People are so frightened about turning their electricity or heating on. It’s a real worry to people now. I do think they could have gone much, much further.” In Calderdale, West Yorkshire, the Tory leader, Steven Leigh, said the public had received “phenomenal” government help since 2020 and predicted his party would make inroads towards taking over the Labour-run council. “They’ve done what they can in the circumstances,” he said of the Treasury. Nathan Evans, the Conservative leader in Trafford, Greater Manchester, said they were hoping to make gains before dislodging Labour in next year’s local elections. He said Sunak had “done what he can do but you can always do more”. However, he added: “We’ve got a million vacancies out there. The way out of poverty isn’t through benefits. The way out of poverty is through work. And it’s tough, and we would all like to do more, but you’ve got to balance it.”",News/Politics,Tory leaders confident of gains in May local elections,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/25/tory-leaders-confident-of-gains-in-may-local-elections
3/26/2022,"When he was 31, Mick Jagger said that he would not be “caught dead” singing Satisfaction at 45. But almost half a century later, Jagger is still belting out the anthem at the age of 78, his youthful determination apparently long forgotten. The past, however, is a foreign country: today’s young people do things differently and this week, the 25-year-old tennis star Ash Barty shocked the public by announcing her retirement. She said her success had not given her satisfaction. Instead, it had redefined what success meant for her. “There was just a little part of me that wasn’t quite satisfied, wasn’t quite fulfilled,” she said. “The time is right now for me to … chase other dreams.” Britain’s reigning US Open champion Emma Raducanu, who has previously spoken about prioritising her mental health, said Barty’s early retirement illustrated “how personal everyone’s objectives and goals are”. Actors Tom Holland and Jack Gleeson would agree: the Spider-Man and Game of Thrones stars, both in their 20s, have had a rocky relationship with early fame. Holland weighed up quitting the profession altogether last year to return to dance, while Gleeson spent six years away from acting after playing the evil teenager Joffrey Baratheon, but returned to television in 2020. High-profile retirements – or disaffection with fame – are a reflection of conversations going on across the younger generation, said Eliza Filby, a former history lecturer at King’s College London who specialises in the study of generations. “These celebrities are picking up on their generation’s zeitgeist by rejecting guidelines bequeathed to them as to how to live their lives,” she said. “For today’s young people, what they do is not who they are.” Almuth McDowall, a professor of organisational psychology at Birkbeck, University of London, said there had been “a collective process of fundamental re-evaluation going on among younger people about what makes their lives good and meaningful”. She said: “They sacrificed two years of their lives for the older generations during the pandemic, which gave them enforced thinking time, and now this war in Europe is emphasising the uncertainty of life. The result is that they’re making significantly different lifestyle decisions to the generations before them.” Brandon, a blogger and former software developer who has adopted the moniker Mad Fientist, saved enough to retire in his 30s. He believed the insecurity of the modern job market led to a millennial rethink of what it meant to work. “Look at the global financial crash, the bursting of the dotcom bubble and now the P&O Ferries sackings: my generation is very aware that financial security isn’t achieved via a 9-5 job,” he said. Joe Olson, a teacher who saved enough to retire at 29, said his generation have conversations online about values. “We agree that there’s more to life than just work – and ideas discussed online can go viral and seep into the public consciousness very quickly,” he said. Another reason for his generation’s shift in attitude, said Olson, was that they were very aware of mental health in what could be a brutal and dehumanising world of work. “A lot of people are forced to work in very difficult conditions, paying ever more towards basic necessities,” he said. “Young people aren’t wanting to disengage. They’re not wanting to quit. But they’re not exclusively interested in financial health any more: they want more balance, more happiness.” Sherridan Hughes, an occupational psychologist, said younger people were a lot less materialistic than previous generations. This might be borne from necessity, she said, but the consequence was liberating. “They know that they can’t afford the house and the car, but they don’t want them any more,” said Hughes. “They’re perfectly happy to rent and that underpins a lot of their life decisions: they’re free to think ‘What do I really want?’” Cary Cooper, a professor of organisational psychology at the Manchester Institute for Collaborative Research on Ageing, said the younger generation’s soul-searching had come at the perfect time: Covid had proved that flexible working was possible, while Brexit had denuded the UK of a swathe of young, talented workers who had returned home. “Companies are having to scramble to attract and retain young, skilled people, with entire sectors realising it’s a bottom-line issue and moving rapidly,” he said, citing the creation of roles such as happiness officers and directors of employee health and wellbeing, who often report directly to CEOs. “The younger generation refuse to be an asset that their employer sweats,” he added. “They’re not prepared to tolerate a working environment that will destroy their life in the long run and, frankly, good for them. The world really is their oyster.”",Lifestyle/Money,Why millennials like Ash Barty are rethinking work,https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/mar/25/why-millennials-like-ashleigh-barty-are-rethinking-work
