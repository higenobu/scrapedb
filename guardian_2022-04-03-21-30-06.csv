4/3/2022,"A millionaire former leader of one of London’s most prominent technology investment firms has been removed from the company after a sexual assault charge. Stefan Glänzer, a cofounder of Passion Capital, will appear at Westminster magistrates court on Thursday charged with one count of sexual assault by touching, according to the Metropolitan police. One of the country’s leading tech investors, Passion’s venture capital investments include the app-based bank Monzo and the insurance startup Marshmallow, and has also secured taxpayer-backed funding through the British Business Bank. Glänzer started Passion in 2011 alongside Eileen Burbidge and Robert Dighero, who now run the company. Glänzer departed in 2018 and did not have “an active role”, Passion said, but he remained a limited partner in some of its funds. Glänzer had made millions founding and leading businesses including the German online auction site Ricardo and the music recommendation site Last.fm. The Met said in a statement: “Stefan Glänzer, 60, of Kensington Park Gardens, W11, was arrested in September 2021 following an allegation made to police in June of the same year. “On Monday, 7 March he was charged by postal requisition with one count of sexual assault by touching.” In a statement, Passion Capital said it was “removing his involvement and membership in all Passion entities that he held from his previous role”, and would seek to limit his financial rewards. The statement said: “Whilst we continue to consider our legal position and options for holding him to account for bringing the firm into disrepute and allegedly behaving in a manner wholly incompatible with our values, we offer our most heartfelt apologies to all of our portfolio company founders and teams, co-investors and fund investors impacted – and most importantly any victims. “Our deep regret is that we did not act to sever all agreements and revoke Mr Glänzer’s rights sooner. To be very clear, we unequivocally condemn any forms of assault or harassment in any situation and there are no words to describe the shame we feel for not speaking up and doing more to sever all ties as soon as we learned of the allegations last month.” A British Business Bank spokeswoman said it was a limited partner in the funds operation by Passion and had no direct involvement in running them. “As a limited partner, the bank has supported Passion Capital in its actions to remove Stefan Glänzer from these funds.” Glänzer did not respond to a request for comment.",News/UK news,London tech investor drops cofounder charged with sexual assault,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/london-tech-investor-drops-cofounder-charged-with-sexual-assault
4/3/2022,"Pink castles, talking sofas, a butler based on a golden candlestick, mirrored ballrooms that stretch into an infinity of twinkling reflections – the fantasies of Walt Disney are so spectacular they seem entirely without precedent. He seems sui generis, a true American genius conjuring visions straight out of thin air. Yet the butler, the ballroom and even the garrulous sofa have their sources, of all kinds, and they are far away from Hollywood in the French rococo art of the 18th century. This is the premise of a mesmerising exhibition opening this week at the Wallace Collection in London. Inspiring Walt Disney aims to show the connection between French art and American animation across three centuries. It pairs objects and images with such persuasive intelligence that you perceive both in a different way. If you don’t generally love the gilded excesses of rococo clocks, paintings and claw-foot tables you may well by the end be seeing them anew through Disney’s eyes. Born in Chicago in 1901, raised in Kansas City, Missouri, Walt Disney first went to Paris as an ambulance driver for the Red Cross after the armistice in 1918. His love of French art set in early. The first of many films on glowing screens through the show is a bewitching sequence from his 1931 classic, The Clock Store. A porcelain couple unfreeze into life before a gilded mantelpiece clock. He bows, she curtseys and so the gracious dance begins, to the minuet from Mozart’s Don Giovanni. Alongside is just such a porcelain figurine, intensely popular in 18th-century Paris. Immediately, you see how brilliantly Disney animates the dancers, using only black ink and wash, turning them round and round through their moves so they seem to have both human motion and a trace of their original porcelain stiffness. It touches very deeply on the childhood dream of inanimate objects magically coming alive. Which is the very essence of rococo art itself, in a way: the impression of motion in stillness, a constant sweeping, dancing, twisting and curving, the animation of the inanimate. It is the velvet sofa with embracing arms and flirtatiously dainty feet, anthropomorphised in Disney films. It is the candlestick with the plump stomach and gilded arms, out-flung, which becomes the butler in Beauty and the Beast. Even the very fable, like Cinderella, like Sleeping Beauty, is, of course, originally French. Sound arrives in 1928, Technicolor in 1932 - you can see it all developing here, most particularly with Disney’s trip to France in 1935. A home movie shows Walt and his brother Roy wandering, enchanted, around Versailles. Very rapidly, you start to see the origins of Cinderella. A drawing of a carriage in front of the palace, soaring windows, colossal libraries, shimmering mirrors in endless recession: the visual vocabulary is there. It is common to talk of magic as inexplicable. You can’t see how it is done. One of the most spellbinding sights at the Wallace Collection is a whole wall of graphite drawings that shows exactly how the rags-to-gown sequence in Cinderella (1950) was achieved. Her godmother scatters the fairy dust that brings about this miracle, represented by literally hundreds of thousands of pencil dots, increasing, decreasing, shifting from one drawing to the next, to describe the dazzling swirl in which Cinderella transforms. It took 24 drawings to make a single second of film. The women of Disney’s ink and paint department copied each one meticulously on to celluloid frames, in colour, and one of the great moments of western cinema was made. The studios were vast, the films immense collaborations. So it was with the elaborate French clocks that chime through this show, the outlandish turreted vases in pistachio and gold that emerged from the Sèvres porcelain factories, even the tea services that turn into characters. There were concept artists – Disney himself, of course, first to last, but also Mary Blair, who came up with the look of Cinderella, and Peter J Hall and Mel Shaw, who worked on the 1991 Beauty and the Beast. The entire opening scene of this film (alas cut) was based on the most famous of all rococo paintings, which hangs in the Wallace Collection – Fragonard’s The Swing. The girl soars upwards in her copious frills, one shoe flying free. An older man on the right thinks he’s pulling the strings, but can’t see her young lover hidden in the bushes. An animated statue of Cupid keeps the secret, knowing finger to his lips. And there in the gallery is the porcelain Cupid on which Fragonard based his figure, just as Disney worked from Fragonard. The Swing eventually made it into both Tangled and Frozen II. And the most famous of all Wallace Collection paintings, Frans Hal’s The Laughing Cavalier, appears on the wall of the castle in Beauty and the Beast. By the time you get to a real gold clock, merry and stout with a cheerful chime, it appears to have come straight out of a Disney animation, even though it was made in 1730. And the table opposite, an elaborate fantasia of walnut, ebony and gilded bronze, now seems to have ballet feet, drawn up in a fancy second position. You start to see the world in a different way, the hallmark of a strong exhibition. Was Disney’s experience of French rococo art inspiration or influence, vocabulary or style? The show allows you to make up your own mind. The team who made Beauty and the Beast worked only streets away in London and my sense is that they were here in this very building, absorbing the art the way Disney absorbed French culture, which is to say, with great depth and humour. The architecture of the Beast’s castle, the sweeping staircases, the twinkling mirrors, the Hals: they are all here at the Wallace Collection; you only have to look.

4/3/2022,"Angela Yvonne Davis was born, in 1944, into a middle-class neighbourhood of Birmingham, Alabama, that was nicknamed Dynamite Hill because the Ku Klux Klan regularly bombed the homes of the African Americans who lived there. As a young woman she had something of a split existence. In Birmingham, where her father, Frank, owned a service station and her mother, Sallye, was a teacher, Black people were expected to sit at the back of the bus. In New York, where Davis lived with a white family for a while (as part of a project to give Black children from the south a better education), she attended an integrated high school and African Americans could sit where they liked. It was at Elisabeth Irwin high school that Davis was taught about socialism in history classes and joined a communist youth group. The Communist Manifesto, she explains in An Autobiography (first published in 1974 and now reissued with a new introduction), was a revelation. “Like an expert surgeon, this document cut away cataracts from my eyes… Once the emancipation of the proletariat became a reality, the foundation was laid for the emancipation of all oppressed groups.” In 1972, the then 28-year-old Davis – philosopher, scholar, activist, supporter of the Marxist Black Panthers – was found not guilty on three counts (murder, kidnapping and conspiracy) after a gun she owned was used in a shootout in which four people died. She had spent 16 months on remand. An Autobiography is centred on the two months she spent on the run (gracing the FBI’s “most wanted” posters) along with her subsequent arrest, imprisonment and trial – experiences that moulded her into an anti-racist, feminist, prison-abolitionist radical. Her book is riveting; as fresh and relevant today as it was almost 50 years ago. The words fire off the page with humour, anger and eloquence. Going back to prison after a court appearance, she writes: “Darkness lay on me like a coffin lid.” In the introduction, Davis writes that she believed the end of capitalism would come in her lifetime. She dismisses this now as “political naivete”. Today she is a professor emerita of history of consciousness and feminist studies at the University of California Santa Cruz and contends that her optimism about the prospects for radical change has been boosted by movements like Black Lives Matter and demands to defund the police. Davis is also one of four authors – including her partner, Gina Dent – of Abolition. Feminism. Now., which argues that in the US (and UK) “race, gender, class, sexuality are more important determinants of who goes to prison than the simple commission of a crime”. Their aim, they state, “as a joyful starting point”, is to build “a truly intersectional, internationalist, abolitionist feminism”. They ask us to consider a system in which, instead of pouring billions into imprisoning people – often the poorest, most traumatised, many struggling with mental health issues and/or addiction – that money is invested in education, health, housing, decent benefits, training and jobs. Civic first aid, if you will, applying the anti-penal mantra: “First, do no harm.” The book refers to the gigantic private jails, mainly in rural areas of the US, that provide both local jobs and significant returns for shareholders; vested interests in maintaining a carceral society. Abolition. Feminism. Now. details how, in 2018, 30% of all monitoring devices such as tags were produced by one company, GEO Group, which also operates the largest number of private prisons. Meanwhile politicians have shamelessly waged “the war on drugs”, introducing prison for life after three strikes. The book claims that in the US there are more Black men behind bars than were enslaved in 1850 – “a contemporary system of racial control” . In her autobiography, Davis expresses her unease at becoming an international political celebrity – her face, with its signature halo of hair, on T-shirts: “My image was a stand-in for the work that masses are able to do in terms of changing the world.” In 1972, on regaining her freedom, she wrote: “Work. Struggle. Confrontation lay before us like a rock-strewn road.” Half a century later, it’s a road on which she still walks. An Autobiography by Angela Y Davis is published by Hamish Hamilton (£20).

4/3/2022,"Madagascar, in the Indian Ocean off the African coast, is the fourth largest island in the world and a biodiversity hotspot. The British primatologist, conservationist and a former vice-chancellor of Cambridge, Dame Alison Richard, has immersed herself in research and conservation projects there since the early 1970s. Her research on lemurs, Madagascar’s endangered indigenous primates, has concentrated on the demography and social behaviour of sifakas, the leaping tree-dwellers found in Madagascar’s coastal forests. Her new book, The Sloth Lemur’s Song, looks at the long history of the island and takes on the persistent myth of it as a timeless, forested paradise destroyed by human settlers. Richard, 74, is the Crosby professor emerita of the human environment at Yale University. What fascinates you about Madagascar?Isolated for 88 million years, it is like a floating evolutionary laboratory. It is so incredibly diverse in its topography, vegetation and array of animals, it is more like a continent. The animals are unique, found nowhere else in the world, and they break a lot of evolutionary “rules”, which make them even more interesting. And the sheer magic of its change over aeons from a chunk of land in the middle of Gondwana, the supercontinent, is consuming. This book is my own interpretation of Madagascar’s past, grounded in science, and I weave in my personal field experiences. I had originally planned to write it together with my husband – who studied Madagascar’s early settlement by people – but he died unexpectedly in 2013. This is a different book, but his ideas are there. What drew you there?My lecturer when I was a Cambridge undergraduate, the late, great primatologist Alison Jolly, suggested it. I first went in 1970 to do my PhD research on lemurs’ distinctive social configuration: unlike most primates, females dominate. I was captivated, but I also quickly saw the environmental challenges and that I had to help. My (then future) husband switched his research focus to Madagascar, and we would take a turn every summer doing our fieldwork there while the other looked after our children (we also lived there on a sabbatical year in the 1980s). I continued to go even when I was a university administrator – it helped keep me sane. Because of Covid I haven’t been for two years now, which feels awful. I’ve never stopped loving my research and being in the field, and I have cherished Malagasy friends and extended family there, built up over 50 years. Where does the myth of Madagascar as a paradise lost come from, and why is it important to overturn?It comes from early French colonists [France colonised Madagascar in 1896] and it is still pervasive. It goes that Madagascar was an entirely forested wonder until the Malagasy arrived a few thousand years ago and started cutting and burning it all down, and continue to. It is important to overturn because it is wrong – the truth is more nuanced – and because it is a problematic basis for building a partnership to deal with today’s environmental challenges. Madagascar’s ancient occupants all but disappeared when the dinosaur-wiping asteroid hit Earth 66m years ago. Who were they and what happened next?They included several distinctive species of dinosaur, a vegetarian crocodile and – my personal favourite – a giant, possibly dinosaur-eating frog (Beelzebufo). A handful of animals from Africa repopulated it: birds which flew over, but also reptiles and small mammals that beat the odds to cross the deep, wide Mozambique Channel. The evidence for a land bridge or island chain is very slim. Most couldn’t swim or float, so had to come on big mats of vegetation mostly arriving before 23m years when the currents got more treacherous still (though hippos and crocodiles arrived in more recent times). Both Madagascar’s now-extinct megafauna – giant lemurs, including the sloth lemur, giant tortoises and enormous flightless elephant birds – and the unique array of wildlife we see today evolved from them. When did people arrive, and where did they come from?The first evidence of humans comes from about 10,000 years ago. Combining information on Malagasy genetics, language and culture, people came first from Africa in small boats, then later, from the seventh century on, Indonesia. They came around the rim of the Indian Ocean in the great trade network or sailed straight across. The genetics suggests that more women came from Indonesia than Africa: perhaps Indonesian families were fleeing the spreading Malaysian empire at the time. Curiously, the Malagasy language is not an African but an Indonesian language. Can humans be blamed for the extinction of Madagascar’s megafauna? There is cave art depicting a giant sloth lemur hunt, and New Zealand’s giant, flightless moa birds seem to have been hunted to extinction.The decline of Madagascar’s megafauna started about 1,000 years ago and was complete by the 16th century. Blame isn’t a word I use. [But] people did have an important hand in the extinctions. The decline coincides with the build-up of coastal populations on the island, and cut marks have been found on small numbers of bones. But it is complicated. Nowhere do you find big piles of bones in village settlements; it is extremely improbable that people embarked on mass slaughter to feed themselves. And land clearing was only in some areas. This extinction was more like death by a thousand cuts – a synergy of effects, including local climate change, that took place over a long time span. With the animals’ probably low reproductive turnover and low density, you wouldn’t have to kill too many for those remaining to have difficulty finding mates. Your particular research focus is white sifakas, and you have studied a population in the south-west for many years. Have you made any interesting observations or discoveries?It can be comical to watch female social dominance in action. A male who makes the mistake of getting too close to a female while she’s feeding gets snarled at, and if he doesn’t back off, she just whops him. We are far from finding a definitive answer, but I think female social dominance has evolved because having offspring is particularly burdensome for most lemurs. Natural selection has favoured females who face down males for food. Females may also select males who aren’t necessarily the most aggressive: I call it the “wimp hypothesis”. I have also observed surprising tree-hugging behaviour, where they hug cool trees as a way of managing heat stress. And, in the mornings, they sunbathe before they become active. They may have a reptilian-like capacity – unusual in mammals – to lower their body temperature and metabolic activity in response to the environment. It could be how their ancestors survived on these vegetation mats crossing the Mozambique Channel. You argue that grasslands already existed in Madagascar and it isn’t all just the result of human destructiveness. Yet modern-day deforestation is happening apace…Grasslands did develop in Madagascar – and some of the megafauna were grassland animals – though we don’t know the extent. But people have also created grasslands. Human-driven habitat destruction is a huge problem. Of the forest that was present 50 years ago, around 44% has disappeared. People clear forests to make fields to feed their families, but there are also complex market forces at work. The future seems bleak. Are conservation efforts a waste of time?It is grim, but I don’t think it’s hopeless. Needed is a strong and less corrupt government to enforce Madagascar’s laws and policies. Meanwhile, there are lots of small-scale examples on the ground. With the aim of improving incomes, I have shipped a half-tonne of salt produced by local Malagasy women to the UK where it is sold through the spice company Steenbergs. It is part of a conservation partnership to find ways for people and nature to live together at Bezà Mahafaly, the village community in the south-west where I do my sifaka work. If these kinds of efforts can scale out, they could have an impact. Is there a particularly scary or moving encounter you’ve had out in the field?I’ve occasionally been chased by female lemurs. They came tearing through the forest straight at me, and I had to run. I was habituating them, which is normally quick and easy. Maybe I got too close and they felt cornered. And witnessing nature isn’t always easy. I was following a particular female sifaka one day who was responding to an alarm call for aerial predators – like hawks – and trying to get back to her group. We found the group sitting, staring at this very large boa snake, slowly stuffing a little bulging-eyed mouse lemur down its throat, feet first. How is climate change affecting things?There has been a tremendous drought in the south these past three years and people are hungry, which puts pressure on the forest as a resource. Certainly, the models show unequivocally that the south is getting hotter and drier. One of our aims is that south-west sifaka populations can move if it becomes untenable for them under climate change. There are corridors of forest along which they can travel, but we need to help protect them. When will you next go to Madagascar and what will you be doing?Hopefully this summer. I’ll be at Bezà Mahafaly, sleeping in my tent, waking at dawn, eating a lot of rice and spending whole days out in the forest with my Malagasy colleagues watching animals we have tagged and are monitoring. We are focused on seeing how the population copes with the current drought. It will give insight into what the future holds with climate change. We will also be visiting villages, talking to elders and meeting with the fierce “salt ladies” who are looking for more salt sales.

4/3/2022,"If Red Hot Chili Peppers’ earlier work was defined by a strain of masculinity so aggressive that the funk-metal genre it inspired might better have been called incelcore, their output since 1999’s Californication has been notable for its mellower, more contemplative sound. That’s been both a blessing and a curse: every so often, they have stumbled across a genuinely moving tune, as with By the Way or Scar Tissue, but most of their 21st-century output has been soul-crushingly dull. Unlimited Love fails to buck that trend. Bloated and self-indulgent, it plods along, with barely a memorable melody or thought-provoking lyric among its 17 tracks. There’s never been much danger of Anthony Kiedis’s words being confused with those of Bob Dylan, but at times here his rhymes would make William McGonagall blanch: “Outside the world within ya/ Bend to the Woolf Virginia”, indeed. It isn’t wholly without merit: the returning John Frusciante throws in some inspired guitar solos, and at least it is shorter than 2006’s 122-minute Stadium Arcadium.

4/3/2022,"“Be your authentic self!” I don’t love it when standup sets end with self-improvement homilies for the audience. But at least Katherine Ryan seems to be practising what she preaches. The Canadian made several successful shows off the back of a steely, self-loving and showily cynical persona – brilliant in its way, but never quite transcending caricature. Her new and best outing, Missus, is quite the departure, as Ryan loosens and softens up, dedicating the 70 minutes to an account of her unexpected marriage to childhood sweetheart Bobby and their surprisingly traditional new life together. It’s a story that finds Ryan inhabiting a more fully human – and even self-deprecating – character without stinting on the tart, high-quality jokes that made her name. The story it tells is rooted in an episode of the genealogy show Who Do You Think You Are?, which sent Ryan home to Canada – where she hooked up with her first boyfriend. Bobby follows her back to the UK, where his unworldly antics and struggles with the local accent (“he’s not shouting at you, he’s just from Belfast”) supply some fruitful fish-out-of-water comedy. The productive line Ryan treads here is between naked adoration for her new beau and horror at finding herself living conventionally and shackled to a straight white male. There’s a fine gag trading on the coincidence, timing-wise, of her marriage and the restrictive first Covid lockdown. There are set pieces, both starring Bobby as a backwoodsman from central casting, about Ryan’s house being burgled, and the not-as-planned birth of her second child. The Ryan that emerges here is blindsided by her life, not in control of it, and prey to a lively array of emotional responses – which makes for animated and sympathetic comedy. That doesn’t at all undermine her command as a performer, on show here in some expert crowd-work when a couple in Row B divulge intriguing details of their not-quite-relationship. Additional material invoking tolerance for anti-vaxxers, and toying with the cultural downsizing of straight white men, flesh out an excellent show. Missus feels like Ryan in three dimensions, a richer, more sympathetic (authentic, even?) persona, albeit with acerbity very much intact.

4/3/2022,"Welcome hubs are being set up at airports, ports and train stations across England to welcome Ukrainian refugees, the government has announced, as pressure mounts on ministers to dramatically overhaul the system by which they can apply for sanctuary in the UK. Nearly £2m is to be spent on 31 hubs across 27 local authorities, the Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities said. Hubs are already up and running at airports including at Luton, Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham, Manchester, and at St Pancras International train station in London. The centres will provide food, clothing and sanitary products to arrivals, act as a space for matched families to meet one another and help Ukrainians travel onward to their accommodation. Emergency £200 cash grants will also be available for those who need them. The move comes as refugee campaigners voice despair at slow progress, red tape and disparity between the UK and EU’s approach to the crisis. Official figures show that as of Wednesday, more than two weeks after the launch of the government’s much-vaunted Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, only 2,700 visas had been granted under it. The UK has granted 25,500 visas to Ukrainian refugees since the beginning of March, 22,800 of which have been issued to people hoping to join relatives in the UK under the Ukraine Family scheme. More than 4 million Ukrainians have fled their country since Russia invaded in February, the vast majority settling in Poland, according to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR. About 6.5 million people have been displaced within Ukraine. Leading charities have called on the government to waive visa requirements for Ukrainian refugees as a short-term measure to bring the UK in line with the EU. The Refugee Council, the British Red Cross, Save the Children and Oxfam said the visa system was “causing great distress to already traumatised Ukrainians”. The government is giving councils £10,500 a person under the Homes for Ukraine scheme to cover arrival costs, safeguarding inspections and access to public services. Up to £8,755 in additional funding is available per child for education. The refugees minister, Richard Harrington, said: “The response of the British public has been incredible, opening their hearts and homes to the people of Ukraine. “Welcome hubs at airports and train stations right across the country stand ready to aid Ukrainians and their families as soon as they arrive in the UK. “Together with the British public, we are doing everything in our power to ensure Ukrainians arrive safely and are supported to rebuild their lives here.”",News/UK news,UK opens more welcome hubs for Ukrainian refugees,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/03/uk-opens-more-welcome-hubs-for-ukrainian-refugees

4/3/2022,"A cabinet minister has rejected calls for the UK to consider rationing energy, as a plan to drastically increase onshore wind power also appeared to be significantly scaled back. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had been a “massive wake-up call” for western nations about their dependence on imported oil and gas, which European countries are now trying to wean themselves off. However, Shapps said the UK would not follow the lead of other countries, such as Germany, that have put emergency measures in place to ration gas if Russia cuts off supplies to Europe. An international row is escalating over Russia’s demand that, from 1 April, all gas purchased by foreign countries must be paid for in roubles – a move that G7 countries have rejected. According to Reuters, the Dutch government said it would urge consumers to use less gas, Greece has called an emergency meeting of suppliers, and the French energy regulator urged consumers not to panic. Labour’s Jonathan Reynolds, the shadow business secretary, said fuel rationing “should be an extreme option”. “We should be making those plans and the government should be preparing – not necessarily in public – for that situation,” he told the BBC’s Sunday Morning show. After the prime minister, Boris Johnson, flew to Saudi Arabia and the UAE to urge oil-producing countries in the Middle East to turn on the taps, Reynolds said the government should not be “shopping from one authoritarian regime to the next for fossil fuels”. He called for the long-delayed energy security strategy to be published with a particular focus on generating more renewable and nuclear energy, as well as improving energy efficiency. Reynolds also said there was “a lot of complacency in this country about the relative lower exposure to Russian gas that we have”, warning that if European countries stopped importing it then they would turn to the same providers used by the UK, squeezing supplies further and keeping prices high. But asked if he could completely rule out energy rationing in the UK, Shapps said: “Yes I can … We don’t see rationing being part of our approach to this, and nor should it be.” Shapps instead raised the prospect of generating more offshore wind, though he appeared to walk back on plans to double the amount of onshore wind power by 2030. The Guardian reported last month that ministers were considering drastically increasing the amount of power generated by onshore wind turbines by the end of the decade from 14 gigawatts to 30. Johnson was headed for a showdown with his own cabinet and backbenchers, but Shapps’s public disapproval will be interpreted as a sign that the government is preparing to back down. Shapps said there “may be places where it’s appropriate”, but that he thought “by and large, I think it’s better to build significant wind power offshore”. Earlier, he told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday show: “I don’t favour a vast increase in onshore windfarms for pretty obvious reasons. They sit on the hills there and can create something of an eyesore for communities as well as actual problems of noise as well.” Instead, Shapps said he favoured nuclear modular reactors. This follows the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, telling the Sunday Telegraph that up to seven nuclear power stations could be built in Britain to radically expand homegrown energy.

The autumn spending review set out £1.2bn in funding for schools to cover forthcoming national insurance increases and “wider cost pressures”, including the new £30,000 starting salary for teachers, as well as fuel price rises.That funding, the schools supplementary grant, has been handed directly to mainstream schools, but it goes via local authorities to special schools, alternative provision and hospital schools through the high needs budget.Special schools are warning that this has resulted in a “postcode lottery” in which some cash-strapped councils are withholding all or part of the grant to bring down deficits in their high needs budgets, whereas others are matching or exceeding the grant received by mainstream schools. Pauline Aitchinson, who runs the National Network of Special Schools (NNoSS), which represents 460 special schools across England, said: “Special schools are very oversubscribed so there has to be a balance – nobody would want to see children suffering as a result of this. “Some schools haven’t had increases in top-ups for many years. They’re seeing real cuts in their funding. We have to make sure that when mainstream schools are getting guarantees of extra funding for extra costs that are no fault of their own, that special, hospital and alternative provision are treated the same. It’s got to be a level playing field.”Aitchinson said the funding was especially important for special schools, which employ more staff members per student, and to help them avoid a looming staffing crisis, with support staff leaving the profession over low pay. “Having these funding guarantees could allow schools to be more strategic in retaining and attracting the right staff for their schools,” she added.According to an NNoSS survey of 135 special schools from mid-March, almost two-thirds had not yet heard from their local authority, despite the health and social care levy coming into force from 1 April, while nine in 10 expected not to receive adequate funding from their local authority.The uncertainty is making it difficult for heads to plan for next year and budget properly, Aitchinson said. She said the Department for Education (DfE) has said the delays are a matter for councils and schools, with no deadline or fixed methodology set out in the guidance to local authorities. One multi-academy trust, the Eden Academy, said all four local authorities in which its special schools were based have so far given different responses. Hillingdon will not pass on any funding, Harrow will give some but has not yet determined how much, Cumbria has passed on 3%, just below the 4% mainstream schools are receiving, and Northumberland has not yet decided, said its chief operating officer, Sudhi Pathak. He said the lack of clarity was making it difficult to establish what support the schools would be able to offer pupils in September, from therapy, including for speech and language, to being able to restrict class sizes to eight pupils, as well as forcing schools to dip into emergency funds to cover unexpected costs such as building works. “I can only budget on something I know is definitely coming in. The danger is I rely on it and it doesn’t materialise.”He added: “Our heads were told this funding is coming and now it looks like it isn’t. We’re still trying to discuss with local authorities to get something out of them. It’s stressful for heads, the uncertainty of not knowing what the budget will look like.” Warren Carratt, the chief executive of Nexus Multi Academy Trust in South Yorkshire, said he thought the decision reflected a view in government that special needs schools were to blame for high needs funding increases in recent years, which he said was an undertone to the Send green paper published last week. “The department’s view seems to be that special schools are well-funded and that’s where the problem lies, rather than that there’s a structural deficit in high needs blocks,” he said. “The green paper seems to suggest financial recovery will come from fewer kids being in special schools, and the department’s unwillingness to direct council’s to pass on the SSG [schools supplementary grant] is to me a clear indicator that the department is saying special schools don’t need more money, which special schools would strongly disagree with.” A DfE spokesperson said the SSG was “paid directly to mainstream schools but for alternative provision, special schools and some others it is paid to local authorities. This replicates the approach taken through the National Funding Formula (NFF), and from 2023-24, the supplementary grant will be rolled into the NFF.”",News/Education,"Special schools in England face funding squeeze, headteachers say",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/apr/03/special-schools-in-england-face-funding-squeeze-headteachers-say
4/3/2022,"If there was a sense of the inevitable to Australia’s coronation as Women’s World Cup champions, the manner in which they got there was still enough to make jaws drop. Alyssa Healy had form lighting up big stages, with her fast 75 at the MCG two years ago setting up a win in the T20 World Cup final. In this tournament the opening bat had 50 overs to play with, and ended up using 46 of them. The result was a monolith of 170 runs, a single innings that was bigger than some teams in the tournament managed with 11. Granted, Natalie Sciver responded with her own special performance, a 148 not out that ended up as one of the great lone-hand innings and kept a glimmer of a chance alive for England until the 10th wicket fell. The difference was the support from other players that Healy got, carrying Australia to 356, and that Sciver didn’t, leaving England 72 runs short of their target. In the end, Sciver’s more important influence on the day may have been the catch she dropped at midwicket with Healy on 41. It was exactly that point of the innings when England could have applied the squeeze. Healy’s 41 had come from 56 balls, well short of the scoring speed she sometimes reaches. Rachael Haynes was also dropped that over on 47 from 67. The collective start was slow enough that it could have transferred pressure onto the next batters in. Instead, Healy closed the gap to reach an even 100 from her hundredth ball. Her next 70 runs took 38. Haynes made 68, then Beth Mooney again showed her versatility by taking a promotion to number three and playing a T20 knock of 62 off 47. Parallels between women’s and men’s cricket are often useless, but Meg Lanning’s champions of 2022 bear such a resemblance to Ricky Ponting’s class of 2003 that it bears remarking on. A world-record winning streak in one-day cricket? Check. Unbeaten through a whole World Cup? Check. A monster score to decide the final before the second innings has even begun? The 2003 team made 359, the 2022 team came three runs short. Healy went well past the 140 not out that Ponting made that day, and indeed past the 149 that Adam Gilchrist made in the 2007 edition. Her 170 is the biggest score in a final, while Sciver finished up in third spot. It is another landmark in the career rise of Healy, a player who averaged single figures with the bat after her first five years of one-day cricket, and is now among the best of the best. Lanning and Ellyse Perry were barely called on, each coming in to smack a couple of boundaries in the last frantic flourish. After all her work to clear a medical test, Perry was bumped down to seven in the chase for fast runs. This is the tale of this Australian side: it has one of the greatest to ever play the game, and often doesn’t need her. The swing bowler Megan Schutt is another long-termer whose spot has recently been covered with comfort. Any question as to her value though was answered in her first four overs. England went after her with three boundaries, but sometimes Schutt is less a bowler than a drone pilot, swerving the ball through the air, and on this occasion smashing into Danni Wyatt’s stumps and Tammy Beaumont’s front pad. Two wickets for 19. England needed the perfect start, Schutt had denied it. From there Australia’s spinners swarmed, Jess Jonassen pinning players down with her left-arm accuracy, and leg-spinner Alana King, still with that new-player sheen, seeing her stocks rise further still. Three wickets apiece, working away at England’s middle order, and every time someone threatened to go large with Sciver, the spinners chiselled them out. Ashleigh Gardner and Tahlia McGrath chipped in for the kind of team performance you expect from this side, where everyone bats, everyone bowls, and everyone does both better than most of the opposition. The success of Australia’s player development system leaves the current team free to enjoy their success, and the other countries needing to turn envy into action. The Australians know they are the best, hence their lasting annoyance about the 2017 World Cup semi-final against India, when they were ambushed by Harmanpreet Kaur’s epic 171. Five years later, Healy’s 170 has all but washed that away.",Sport/Sport,Alyssa Healy lights up World Cup final as Australia prove they are without equal | Geoff Lemon,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/apr/03/alyssa-healy-world-cup-final-australia-england
