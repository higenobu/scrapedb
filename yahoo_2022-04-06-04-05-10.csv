4/6/2022,"One of the catches when you use a tax-advantaged retirement account like a 401(k) or an IRA is that once you hit a certain age, you have to start taking a minimum amount of money out each year - to stop people from protecting the money from taxes for too long. Some may wonder, though, if they can simply reinvest that money immediately. The answer is that yes, you can put the money you take out in required minimum distributions back in the market right away - so long as you don't use another tax-advantaged account. For more help with retirement investments, consider working with a financial advisor. What Is A Required Minimum Distribution? As the IRS puts it, ""You cannot keep retirement funds in your account indefinitely."" The required minimum distribution addresses that issue. When you have a tax-advantaged retirement account, like a 401(k) or an IRA, the IRS requires you to begin making withdrawals once you reach the maximum age. That age is: 72 years old if you turn or turned 70 after June 1, 2019; 70.5 (that is, six months after you turn 70) if you turned 70 before June 1, 2019. After this age, you must begin making what the IRS calls ""required minimum distributions,"" or RMDs. This is the minimum amount that you must withdraw from your retirement account each year or else you risk facing tax penalties. You can withdraw more than this amount if you would like, but you may not withdraw less. The reason for this is that your withdrawals are included in your taxable income. Tax-advantaged retirement accounts allow you to defer paying taxes on certain portions of your income until retirement, but eventually the IRS would like to get this money. Minimum distributions ensure that you begin paying taxes on your retirement account eventually. Per the IRS's website, required minimum distributions apply to the following accounts: traditional IRAs SEP IRAs SIMPLE IRAs 401(k) plans 403(b) plans 457(b) plans profit-sharing plans other defined-contribution plans Required minimum distributions do not apply to Roth IRAs. This is the only significant tax-advantaged retirement account that is omitted from this requirement. You do not have to pay taxes here because you have already paid taxes on the money you invested, so the IRS does not have anything unpaid to collect from you. How Much Are Required Minimum Distributions? Your required minimum distribution changes from household to household and year to year. As the IRS describes it: ""The required minimum distribution for any year is the account balance as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year divided by a distribution period from the IRS's ‘Uniform Lifetime Table.' A separate table is used if the sole beneficiary is the owner's spouse who is 10 or more years younger than the owner."" This is less complicated than it seems. Basically, you follow three steps: Find your account balance as of Dec. 31 in the preceding year; Find your applicable distribution factor, generally it's age-based and goes down as you get older; and Divide your account balance by your distribution factor. Here is the chart for determining your distribution factor (keep in mind that if you turned 70 after June 1, 2019, you don't have to take an RMD until age 72: IRA Required Minimum Distributions Age Distribution Period 70 27.4 71 26.5 72 25.6 73 24.7 74 23.8 75 22.9 76 22.0 77 21.2 78 20.3 79 19.5 80 18.7 81 17.9 82 17.1 83 16.3 84 15.5 85 14.8 86 14.1 87 13.4 88 12.7 89 12.0 90 11.4 91 10.8 92 10.2 93 9.6 94 9.1 95 8.6 96 8.1 97 7.6 98 7.1 99 6.7 100 6.3 101 5.9 102 5.5 103 5.2 104 4.9 105 4.5 106 4.2 107 3.9 108 3.7 109 3.4 110 3.1 111 2.9 112 2.6 113 2.4 114 2.1 115 and over 1.9 So, for example, say you have $500,000 in your retirement account as of Dec. 31 and, per the Uniform Lifetime Table, have a distribution factor of 25. You would divide $500,000by 25, to get a minimum withdrawal of $20,000 in this calendar year. Remember that required minimum distributions are calculated per account and per year. So if you have multiple retirement accounts, you must calculate your required minimum distribution for each retirement account each year. Can You Reinvest Your Required Minimum Distribution? You can reinvest your required minimum distribution in any account or asset that is not a tax-advantaged retirement account. So, for example, you could buy stocks, bonds, real estate or any other financial assets with your RMD. However, you could not put this money into an IRA or a 401(k). The exception to this rule is the Roth IRA. If you are eligible to put money into a Roth IRA, you can do so with required minimum distribution money. (In general, Roth IRAs are exempt from RMD rules.) In other words, except for Roth IRAs, so long as the IRS isn't giving you a tax break on the portfolio, feel free to reinvest. The Bottom Line  You can reinvest a required minimum distribution so long as you don't put the money into a tax-advantaged retirement account. Other than that, you're free to do as you please.

4/6/2022,"The stock market can be a fickle place, as we’ve seen this year. Starting early in January, all the main indexes fell, in a broad-based sell-off caused, at least in part, by worries over inflation and the Federal Reserve’s decision to start raising interest rates in response. The promised end of the central bank’s long-standing easy money policy spooked investors. The currents shifted in mid-March, however, after the Fed pulled the trigger with a quarter-point rate hike. The collective mind calmed down, took a deep breath – and markets rebounded. Investors also seemed encouraged by negotiations aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war. The S&P 500 is officially out of correction territory now, and trending upwards. While starting back up, markets are still down this year – and that means that plenty of stocks are down even further, since the indexes are only averages. With this in mind, we’ve used the TipRanks database to find three stocks that are showing depressed prices along with strong fundamentals – a combination that bodes well when markets are rising. They all have Strong Buy consensus ratings, while their share prices are hovering at 52-week low levels. We can find out more by taking a quick look under the hood. Asure Software (ASUR) We’ll start with Asure Software, a resource and solution provider in human capital management, or HCR. Asure offers software packages to make payroll and tax accounting easy. The company boasts over 80,000 small- to mid-market companies in its customer base, and processes over 33 million paychecks annually. We are entering the US tax season, and Asure’s products are in high demand. In one example of this, the company announced in February that it had filed for over $200 million in stimulus funding on behalf of its clients. Last month, Asure released its financial results for 4Q21. For the quarter, the company reported $21.1 million in revenue, up 29% year-over-year. The full-year revenue came in at $76.1 million, for a gain of 16% y/y. Non-GAAP net EPS was reported at 2 cents per share, compared to a break-even in 4Q20. It’s important to note that the company’s big earnings quarter is Q1. Asure’s stock is down 24% so far this year. While in part this can be attributed to the general market downturn early in the year, the company’s guidance has likely not helped. While still predicting revenue growth, the company’s guidance shows it expects to slow down this year. The Q1 guidance was $23.5 million at the midline, or up 18% y/y, while the full year guidance, of $87.5 million at the midline, predicts a 14% y/y gain. On earnings, however, the 4 to 6 cent non-GAAP EPS predicted in the first quarter is less than half of the 12 cents reported in 1Q21. Weighing in from Roth Capital, 5-star analyst Richard Baldry believes that Asure won’t be down for long. He writes: “In our view, ASUR appears poised to improve organic growth materially in 2022 as recent aggressive sales hiring yields greater productivity with deepening tenure. Therefore, with ASUR trading at only 1.8x run-rate revenues (net of net debt), or roughly 75% lower than our 7.3x SaaS peer average, we see material upside ahead if growth re-accelerates as we expect."" Given all of the above, Baldry has high hopes. Along with a Buy rating, the analyst keeps a $16 price target on the stock. This target puts the upside potential at a whooping 169%. (To watch Baldry’s track record, click here) The unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating on ASUR shares, based on 6 positive analyst reviews, shows that the Street is upbeat on this stock. The average price target, at $12.08, suggests an upside of 103% from the current trading price of $5.95. (See ASUR stock forecast on TipRanks) Citi Trends (CTRN) Next up is Citi Trends, an apparel retailer specializing in discounted ‘urban chic.’ The company is based in Savannah, Georgia, and runs more than 600 brick-and-mortar stores in 33 states. Citi Trends also has a full-service online site, and a strong e-commerce presence. After its revenues and earnings surged when the economy began to reopen in 4Q20 and 1Q21, Citi Trends has seen the top and bottom lines fall back toward the end of 2021. The Q4 financial results showed $240.9 million at the top line, down from $251.9 million in the year-ago quarter. Diluted EPS was reported at $1.16, down 35% from 4Q20. While these numbers showed a year-over-year drop off, they still came in above expectations. Before the release, EPS was forecast at $1.07, and the result beat that by ~8%. What hit the company hard, however, was a trim to 2021 full-year guidance issued in January. Management cited a combination of resurgent COVID and lower store traffic when cut back its full-year 2021 revenue prediction from the $1 billion to $1.015 billion range to the range of $990 million to $995 million. In the event, the 2021’s top line came in at $991.6 million. Benchmark analyst John Lawrence is not concerned by the mixed results of the recent quarters, and lays out a case for buying this stock now “We have been impressed by the changes implemented by the management team over the past couple of years. Our thesis continues to focus on the new CTx store format which changes the merchandise presentation. Management indicated February and March results have improved. The productivity curve is in place as better buying improves the sell through and enhances margin with reduced markdowns. Improved visibility of new unit and remodel performance is the primary catalyst going forward. The comp performance is enhanced as theremodels enter the comp base. We continue to recommend purchase,” Lawrence opined. In light of those comments, Lawrence recommends this stock as a Buy. His $70 price target indicates a 136% one-year upside potential. (To watch Lawrence’s track record, click here) Lawrence is not alone in his bullish take on Citi Trends; the stock has 4 recent analyst reviews, all positive, making for a unanimous Strong Buy analyst consensus rating. Shares are trading for $29.65 and their $63.75 average price target implies an upside of 115% from that level. (See CTRN stock forecast on TipRanks) Floor & Decor Holdings (FND) Last up is Floor & Decor Holdings. Founded back in 2000, and based in Atlanta, Georgia, the company offers a wide range of hard-surface flooring for everything from homes to stores to offices. The company operates 2 design studios and 160 large warehouse stores, averaging 78,000 square feet, in 33 states. The company caters to professional contractors, home improvement retailers, and do-it-yourselfers. Floor & Decor offers a range of products, from laminate flooring to vinyl to tiles to wood to natural stone. In the past two months, FND has opened 7 new stores, in locations as far-flung as Portland, Oregon; Chicago, Illinois; and McAllen, Texas. These openings are part of a concerted plan by management to reach 400 stores in the coming decade; the company plans to open a total of 32 stores this year alone. That ambitious plan is fueled by rising revenues and earnings that, until the most recently reported quarter (4Q21) had been consistently beating expectations. At the top line, the last report showed $914.3 million, up 26% year-over-year. At the bottom line, diluted EPS came in at 44 cents. This was the second quarter in a row with a sequential earnings decline, and the result was down more than 6% y/y. Looking ahead, the company estimates full-year 2022 revenues to come in at approximately $4.325 billion. This would represent a gain of 26% y/y. Despite the growth, FND shares have fallen 36% so far this year. Well Fargo’s 5-star analyst Zachary Fadem sees high potential for Floor & Decor going forward, especially in the pro contractor niche. He writes of this stock: “FND sits among the few unicorns in retail, with a business model strong enough to post consistently strong (MSD%+) comps, +20% unit growth and a host of opportunity from Pro initiatives, an emerging design concept and inorganic Commercial growth... At 32x NTM PE (-19%/-24% vs 3/5 year avg.), we see a compelling LT entry point for one of the highest quality growth stories in all of retail."" This, among other things, including residential remodeling and an addressable market totaling $49 billion to $54 billion, leads Fadem to set an Overweight (i.e. Buy) rating on FND shares, and his $130 price target suggests an upside potential of 56% for the year ahead. (To watch Fadem’s track record, click here) Overall, this stock has picked up plenty of interest from Wall Street – in the form of 15 recent analyst reviews. These break down 12 to 3 in favor of Buy over Hold, propping up the Strong Buy consensus. The shares are trading at $83.28 and their $129.80 average target suggests a one-year upside of ~56%.

4/6/2022,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The United States stopped the Russian government on Monday from paying holders of its sovereign debt more than $600 million from reserves held at U.S. banks, in a move meant to ratchet up pressure on Moscow and eat into its holdings of dollars. Under sanctions put in place after Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, foreign currency reserves held by the Russian central bank at U.S. financial institutions were frozen. But the Treasury Department had been allowing the Russian government to use those funds to make coupon payments on dollar-denominated sovereign debt on a case-by-case basis. On Monday, as the largest of the payments came due, including a $552.4 million principal payment on a maturing bond, the U.S. government decided to cut off Moscow's access to the frozen funds, according to a U.S. Treasury spokesperson. An $84 million coupon payment was also due on Monday on a 2042 sovereign dollar bond. The move was meant to force Moscow to make the difficult decision of whether it would use dollars that it has access to for payments on its debt or for other purposes, including supporting its war effort, the spokesperson said. Russia faces a historic default if it chooses to not do so. ""Russia must choose between draining remaining valuable dollar reserves or new revenue coming in, or default,"" the spokesperson said. JPMorgan Chase & Co, which had been processing payments as a correspondent bank so far, was stopped by the Treasury, a source familiar with the matter said. The correspondent bank processes the coupon payments from Russia, sending them to the payment agent to distribute to overseas bondholders. The country has a 30-day grace period to make the payment, the source said. DEFAULT WORRIES Russia does have the wherewithal to pay from reserves, since sanctions have frozen roughly half of some $640 billion in Russia's gold and foreign currency reserves. But a drawdown would add pressure just as the United States and Europe are planning new sanctions this week to punish Moscow over civilian killings in Ukraine. Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation"". Ukraine and the West say the invasion was illegal and unjustified. Images of a mass grave and the bound bodies of people shot at close range drew an international outcry on Monday. Russia, which has a total of 15 international bonds outstanding with a face value of around $40 billion, has managed to avoid defaulting on its international debt despite unprecedented Western sanctions. But the task is getting harder. ""What they're basically tying to do is force their hand and put even more pressure on (to deplete) foreign-currency reserves back home,"" said David Wolber, a sanctions lawyer at Gibson Dunn in Hong Kong. ""If they have to do that, obviously that takes away from Russia's ability to use those dollars for other activities, in essence to fund the war."" It may also put pressure on Russian demands to be paid roubles for gas by European customers, he added. Russia was last allowed to make a $447 million coupon payment on a 2030 sovereign dollar bond, due last Thursday, which was at least the fifth such payment since the war began. If Russia fails to make any of its upcoming bond payments within their pre-defined timeframes, or pays in roubles where dollars, euros or another currency is specified, it will constitute a default. While Russia is not able to access international borrowing markets due to sanctions, a default would prohibit it from accessing those markets until creditors are fully repaid and any legal cases stemming from the default are settled.
