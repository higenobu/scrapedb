1/6/2022,"Jacob Chansley, the convicted Jan. 6 rioter also known as the “QAnon Shaman,” now claims he was just trying to help during the insurrection. “I actually tried to, on more than one occasion, calm the crowd,” he told “Inside Edition.” “But it just didn’t work.” Chansley also said that he regrets not doing more to keep the peace as supporters of former President Donald Trump attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to block the certification of the 2020 election results. However, multiple videos and images showed him howling and chanting his way through the Capitol and inside the Senate Chamber. Prosecutors said he yelled, “Times up, motherfuckers,” and left a note on then-Vice President Mike Pence’s desk that said, “It’s only a matter of time. Justice is coming.” Chansley was known for his frequent appearances at demonstrations and rallies wearing face-paint and a furry headdress with horns. Yet in his interview with “Inside Edition,” he blamed the media for turning him into the public face of the riot. His mother said he shouldn’t be in prison because Trump invited the protesters to the Capitol. Read the full interview here. Chansley pleaded guilty to one felony count of obstruction of an official proceeding last year and was sentenced to 41 months in prison.

And that's you worked with Steve Jobs. Apple built a music business when you were there. What did you learn from Steve and what do you think he'd be thinking about the world today and the technology that we're using? TONY FADELL: Well, I think for me, what it was all about in the Music Store in the iPod, it was always about what do the customers really want? What is going to give them that social or excuse me, that emotional experience that they crave, that they want, and a rational part of that, making it simple and all those other things. And that's like dice. So, when you see something like this, you're like, wow. I think that if Steve was here today, he would go we need to get artists more money. I think if he looked at the streaming services out there, I know how much you loved musicians, bands, and wanted to support them. I remember way back when, he was looking at buying certain media companies, that kind of stuff, because he really wanted to revolutionize that.
