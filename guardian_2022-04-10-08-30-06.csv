4/10/2022,"It felt for so much of day three that Augusta National yearned for something even resembling a contest. It was Scottie Scheffler’s job to ensure one did not ensue. For 17 holes, he was a man in complete control of all around him. What happened next offers hope. There may be a thrilling Masters denouement after all. There will be no sixth Green Jacket for Tiger Woods. Not at this attempt, anyway. Those who flocked to Georgia in search of yet another Woods redemption tale have been left disappointed. Freakishly cold weather and Scheffler’s powerful frontrunning added to an unavoidable sense of Saturday deflation. Plenty of polite applause, precious little roaring. Until, that is, Scheffler pulled his drive at the last into bushes. Scheffler is the world No1 and a player in outstanding form but perhaps he lacks the presence or panache as would so appeal to the galleries. He goes about his business in a functional manner. Maybe it is as simple as attendees wanting to witness a proper battle. As Scheffler stood firm, pretenders swung and missed. Curious things can happen on the final day, on the final nine, at Augusta National but for so long this major has been Scheffler’s to lose. He will carry a three-shot lead, over Cameron Smith, into the last 18 holes. Scheffler posted a third round of 71 to edge to nine under par. Intrigue surrounds the impact of what transpired at the last – Scheffler eventually rescued a five on the par four – and whether Smith, an Augusta specialist, can rattle his opponent. An example of the earlier inability of others to meaningfully challenge Scheffler was provided by Charl Schwartzel. The South African, a past Masters champion, holed his second shot to the par four 10th to jump to within five of Scheffler. One hole later, Schwartzel carved his second shot horribly right into spectators. Scheffler, playing in Schwartzel’s company, had no cause to feel threatened at all as Schwartzel holed out for a bogey. Scheffler had birdied the 2nd and 3rd to move to double digits under par. Context is provided by the fact many players reckoned that would be sufficient to claim this Masters. Scheffler moved to minus 11 at the 8th, a position he maintained through Amen Corner after cancelling out a bogey on 12 with a birdie at the 13th. The latter owed much to the kind of good fortune as has favoured Scheffler over three days. His tee shot to the par five was wayward but rebounded from a tree and into semi-rough. Smith emerged as Scheffler’s most meaningful threat. The Australian reached five under for his round at the 15th, giving a seven under total, before handing a shot back to the course on the par three 16th. Still, Smith’s impressive Augusta record and recent success at the Players Championship provide hope for neutrals that Scheffler could be hauled into a day four scrap. Scheffler’s bogey at the 14th after his approach spun off the green narrowed the lead to four. Given it had been six not long before, this was borderline exciting. Smith overshot the 18th green but saved par admirably. His second 68 of this week means a minus six aggregate. A mullet with a major? As Scheffler dropped shots at the 14th and 15th, heads turned. The 25-year-old proceeded to birdie the 17th, thanks to a terrific approach. At the last, finally, drama. Woods’s challenge ended with a four-putt at the 5th, the first time such he has encountered such a statistic in his Masters career. The greens were to bother Woods all day, with 36 putts included in a 78. He is now seven over par, with round four really only going to be useful as a barometer of his physical condition. It is to be remembered even playing in this Masters, let alone for 72 holes, is a remarkable achievement given the scale of his injuries after a car crash 14 months ago. Still, the character of the man is such that he will be embarrassed by finishing on the nether regions of the leaderboard. “It felt like I hit 1000 putts out there,” said Woods. “I did what I needed to do ball striking-wise, but I did absolutely the exact opposite on the greens. I just could not get a feel for getting comfortable with the ball. Posture, feel, my right hand, my release, I just couldn’t find it. For as many putts as I had, you’d think I’d have figured it out somewhere along the line, but it just didn’t happen.” Woods, one assumes, will already have next month’s USPGA Championship at Southern Hills on his mind. He won the same tournament at the same venue in 2007. Im Sung-jae, second here in 2020, is at minus four. Justin Thomas moved from one to three under par within a trio of holes. The 28-year-old slipped back to even par at the 14th and collected shots at the 16th and 18th before a painful bogey at the last. Thomas, who signed for a 72 and one under total, must continue to rue his opening round of 76. Corey Conners is on the same score as Thomas. Shane Lowry berated his caddie en route to a bogey at the 13th, as shuffled him back to three under. Lowry had been two shots better off on the 9th tee. If Lowry’s frustration was understandable, it would have been better directed elsewhere. The Irishman lies two under after a 73. Lowry is not completely without hope but needs more Scheffler wobbling. So, apparently, do the patrons.",Sport/Sport,Masters frontrunner Scottie Scheffler faces challenge from Cameron Smith,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/10/masters-frontrunner-scottie-scheffler-faces-challenge-from-cameron-smith
4/10/2022,"Arecession lurks just around the corner. That’s what many economists and financial analysts in the UK and across Europe fear as inflationary pressures collide with the Russian invasion of Ukraine to undermine the post-Covid recovery. On Monday, the Office for National Statistics will report on how much the UK economy expanded in February. Any chance of matching January’s GDP growth looks optimistic. Sanjay Raja, senior economist at Deutsche Bank, believes that after January’s rise of 8% – well above most analysts’ expectations – growth will fall to just 0.1% in February, dragged down by a dip in industrial production. “The bad news is that we don’t expect the recent strength in activity to last very long,” he said, adding that a decline in March was also likely, which will mean GDP growth in the first quarter may not even reach 1%. A contraction in the second quarter is almost certain, given “a bigger jump in energy and food bills, higher taxes, a reversal in Covid health spending, some unwinding of stocks in the manufacturing sector, and the extra June bank holiday”. Suren Thiru, head of economics at British Chambers of Commerce, said the combined growth rate in January and February would seem like a high-water mark: “When we look at February’s figures, it will feel like we are looking in the rear-view mirror.” Thiru agrees with Raja that it will be downhill from March for the UK. GDP in the second quarter, from April to June, is likely to contract. Economic convention says that if there is a second quarter of negative growth from July to September, the UK will officially be in a recession. At the moment, few forecasters are suggesting that the UK is about to experience two consecutive quarters of negative growth, but most say the risk to their predictions is undue optimism. Uncertainty, in particular, is a growth killer and there is plenty of economic uncertainty around at the moment. A long war in Ukraine, increased sanctions against Russia and oil prices that stay above $100 a barrel will probably push inflation to even higher levels and undermine any sense among businesses and consumers that it is safe to make investment decisions. A gas price that continued to be more than five times its pre-pandemic level, fuelling a cost-of-living crisis, would only make matters worse, said Thiru. Consumer confidence has slumped in recent months, and now stands at the low levels registered before the second lockdown in 2020. Business confidence has also crumbled, according to the Lloyds Bank business barometer. Lloyds said March’s fall in confidence was the biggest since the first two months of the pandemic. The situation could worsen if central banks misread the signals from the economy and persisted with plans to raise interest rates, said Dario Perkins, an economist at consultancy TS Lombard. He argues that the Bank of England – and possibly the European Central Bank – are poised to make a historic mistake that could plunge their respective economies into recession. Both the Bank and ECB have talked tough about tackling inflation with higher borrowing costs. Financial markets predict that the Bank of England could push its base rate to 2% next year, from the current 0.75%. “Rapid monetary tightening outside the US is likely to end in a Trichet-style fiasco,” said Perkins. He is referring to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crash when, seeing commodity prices, and especially the price of oil, rocketing, ECB boss Jean-Claude Trichet was convinced that he needed to begin increasing interest rates. The highly indebted eurozone economy was unable to cope and by 2012, the continent was plunged into a crisis that almost brought the euro project to an end. Albert Edwards, the global strategist at Société Générale, said just the threat of higher interest rates in the US had already made borrowing more expensive and had capped the number of interest rate rises that were needed. That should prevent the Federal Reserve pushing its base rate above 1%. The UK may see rates rising to slightly above this level, while the eurozone, where interest rates are currently negative, could be looking at its first positive interest rate since 2012. But concerns about increased rates leading to a recession are almost certain to stay the hand of most rate-setters.",News/Business,High prices and low growth should nip UK and eurozone interest rate rises in the bud,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/10/high-prices-low-growth-nip-interest-rate-rises-in-bud

4/10/2022,"“Ifeel like I’m right there,” said Rory McIlroy on Friday night, as he weighed his chances after back‑to‑back rounds of 73 on Thursday and Friday. “You go out tomorrow and you play a decent front nine, and all of a sudden you’re right in the thick of things.” Seventeen hours later, he stepped out on to the 1st tee and, thwack, dumped his opening drive right into a fairway bunker, then, crack, whacked his second shot into the lip where it rebounded and fell back down by his feet. His third made it on to the green, where he took two putts from 20ft. So McIlroy started his charge to the top by dropping a shot. From there, it was off to long downhill dog-leg 2nd, which has been the easiest hole on the course this week. The field have made more than a hundred birdies there. Just the place to get that run up the leaderboard going, then. This time there was a long, loud cry of “Right!” as McIlroy’s drive whizzed overhead into the gallery, after that he fizzed his second into the front bunker, and scrambled his way out in even par. On to the stiff uphill 3rd then, a trickier proposition this, but McIlroy earned a birdie chance with a brilliant approach that landed 7ft from the pin. Then he missed the putt. Oh, Rory. Who ever hoped harder than a McIlroy fan in Masters week? And who ever suffered more for their faith? After 14 years of watching this sort of carry on, a lot of the locals have given up backing him to win. He still draws a large gallery, and has a lot of support, but it feels tinged with sympathy. A lot of them moved on from anticipation through frustration to lower expectations. And then he goes and makes a putt like the one he rolled in from 37ft for a birdie on the 4th, and you are reminded why Gary Player said on Thursday: “He is, basically the most talented player I’ve seen in ages.” Those two holes, the missed putt from 7ft at the 3rd, and the made putt from 37ft at the 4th, about summed the round up. It was all one step forward and one step back again. At the 6th, he missed a par putt from 6ft after he had chipped on to the green, then at the 7th, minutes later, he made a birdie putt coming back from three times the distance. He makes some shots no one could, then misses some no one should. At the 10th, which he usually has such trouble with, he hit a glorious approach shot to 8ft and just when you were wondering if he was going to go on a run round the back nine, he missed the birdie putt. The overall impression was of a man trying to start a fire with a flint and a few damp sticks. There were a lot of sparks but it never caught light. At the 12th, McIlroy’s tee shot was over the back on to the bank, and he needed three putts to finish it from there. So that was another dropped shot. And then at the 13th, inevitably, he hit his second to within inches of the pin and nearly picked up an eagle. There was another birdie at the 15th, the other par-five on the back nine, which put him under par for the round for the first time. He stayed there, one under for the day, one over for the tournament. McIlroy’s Sunday record at Augusta is so good (he is a total of 21 under par here in the eight Sunday rounds he has played since 2012, with six rounds in the 60s) that in the right circumstances that score would still leave him a swinger’s chance at winning the thing. In fact his whole strategy this week has been based around putting himself in position to do exactly that. He’s been trying to play the kind of slow, steady and sensible golf that would ensure he is in contention come the back nine on Sunday. But not this year, when the lead is well out of reach whatever he scores. He admitted as much himself. His new plan for Sunday is “to go out and shoot the best score that you possibly can without being reckless and without taking on too much risk. I’ll try to go out and do that tomorrow. I think I moved up a few places with that score today, and I’ll just try to move up a few more tomorrow and try to get a top ten and move on.” His Sunday record is so good here it wouldn’t be a surprise if he did it, too. It would be his seventh top‑10 finish in the last nine years if he does. So it’s another chance gone. The “boring” Rory strategy didn’t work out much better for him than any of the other approaches he’s used while he has been trying to finish off his grand slam. You wonder what he will come up with this time next April. By then, of course, the dreaming will start all over again. If he could only make one or two more of those putts he missed, if he could just play a couple more holes the way he did 4th, or the 7th then … and that’s what gets you back to hoping.",Sport/Sport,Rory McIlroy treads water trying to keep his Masters dream alive | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/09/rory-mcilroy-treads-water-trying-to-keep-his-masters-dream-alive
