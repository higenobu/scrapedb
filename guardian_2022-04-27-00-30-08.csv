4/27/2022,"Jürgen Klopp has said Liverpool will not fall into the same trap as Bayern Munich and Juventus in underestimating a Villarreal side “made for” the Champions League. Liverpool are strong favourites to reach a third Champions League final in five seasons at the expense of Unai Emery’s team, who sit seventh in La Liga and visit Anfield in the semi-final first leg on Wednesday. Villarreal beat Bayern in the quarter-finals and Juventus in the last 16, winning 3-0 in Turin to record a 4-1 aggregate victory, and while Klopp believes both European heavyweights may have been guilty of complacency, he insists Liverpool will not repeat the mistake against the Europa League holders. The Liverpool manager said: “It is absolutely special to be part of the semi-final, it’s crazy. It is a massive game. So many coaches, so many players out there work their socks off their whole life and have no chance to be even close to a semi-final so we have to cherish it, appreciate and enjoy it as well. “We face a very difficult opponent. They are made for this competition, to be 100% honest. The way they set it up is really good. There might have been a little advantage in the last two games, maybe Juve or Bayern underestimated them, but that will never happen to us. There is no chance, so this little advantage might have gone. But they are still a really good football team who want to make history as well. It would be the first time they go to a final, which would be a massive thing for Villarreal I can imagine, but it is to us the same importance.” Roberto Firmino remains a doubt with the foot injury that kept him out of Liverpool’s past two Premier League wins over Everton and Manchester United, but otherwise Klopp has a full squad available.",Sport/Football,‘No chance’: Klopp insists Liverpool will not underestimate Villarreal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/26/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-will-not-underestimate-villarreal-champions-league
4/27/2022,"More than 200,000 private renters have been served eviction notices without doing anything wrong in the three years since the government first promised to ban the practice, housing campaigners have claimed. Every seven minutes a tenant has been landed with a no-fault eviction notice since Theresa May’s Conservative government first committed to scrap them in April 2019, according to research by Shelter, the housing charity. Tenants have told of the shock, stress and thousands of pounds of unexpected bills caused by the practice, which means private renters can be evicted with two months’ notice and without the landlord giving a reason. Tenants groups representing England’s 4.5m private renting households have become increasingly frustrated at ministers’ repeated failures to deliver on promises to end the practice in 2019 and 2021. “It’s appalling that every seven minutes another private renter is slapped with a no-fault eviction notice despite the government promising to scrap these grossly unfair evictions three years ago,” said Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter. “It’s no wonder many renters feel forgotten. Millions of private renters are living in limbo – never truly able to settle – in case their landlord kicks them out on a whim.” The charity polled private renters this month and asked how many had received the section 21 eviction notices. It extrapolated the responses to estimate that more than 200 renters in England are being hit by the practice a day. The latest estimates around the impact of the practice come before next month’s Queen’s speech, which the government said on Tuesday will “set out reforms to make renting fairer for all, including by banning section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions as soon as possible”. Karen Wake, 61, has been hit by no-fault evictions three times. The most recent notice will remove her from her East Sussex home which she rented three years ago, not only because of its open plan living area, French doors and wood burner, but because it was advertised as a “long-term let”. In March, she was given two months to move out. “It’s a shock, I’m back into the renting circus.” Worst of all is the feeling of having no control over her destiny, said Wake, who has been forced to spend about £1,500 on moving costs. A section 21 could arrive at any time. “I’m in my 60s, I could be doing this for the rest of my life,” she said. Also affected is Andrew Shaw, a 34-year-old IT worker who rented a house in Bedfordshire for three years. His children, aged one and four, had their own rooms and Shaw grew pumpkins and peas in the garden. But in October, when Shaw received a section 21 notice, “my heart stopped beating for a second”, he said. “I was really stressed. It felt like when you have a really big exam, you can feel it in your chest.” The family found a new house but the rent costs £350 more a month. “There’s no more savings,” he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said: “Our private rented sector white paper will set out reforms to make renting fairer for all, including by banning section 21 ‘no fault’ evictions as soon as possible. “We are also providing a £22bn package of support to help households with rising costs. This includes putting an average of £1,000 more a year into the pockets of working families via universal credit and direct support for bills.” ",Lifestyle/Money,"No-fault evictions: 200,000 renters in England served notices in three years",https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/apr/26/200000-private-renters-served-no-fault-eviction-notices-three-years
4/27/2022,"Rob Key has locked in his first major policy decision as director of England men’s cricket after formally advertising for two new head coaches, separated by way of Test and white-ball formats. Though a widely anticipated split amid a bulging fixture and greater separation of players, it begins to firm up Key’s vision for the national teams after a winless winter in Test cricket and a T20 World Cup that ended in a semi-final defeat. Key will further outline this when he is officially unveiled at Lord’s this Thursday, 10 days into a job that has seen him initially working on the leadership vacuum left by Chris Silverwood’s departure as head coach after the Ashes defeat and Joe Root’s more recent resignation as Test captain. Ben Stokes is the clear favourite to replace Root and could even be confirmed by Key this week. But while Key has begun sounding out the market for the two new head coach roles, appointments are not imminent given an official deadline of 6 May and a first interview stage starting three days later. It leaves less than a month to have a head coach in place before the first Test against New Zealand at Lord’s on 2 June and, given notice periods plus the likelihood of an overseas coach who may need to relocate, an interim may yet be required to start the international summer. Gary Kirsten, Graham Ford and Simon Katich are the frontrunners for the Test role, with the latter possibly also under consideration for the white-ball vacancy. It will be only the second time England have split the coaching role by way of format, after Ashley Giles was the white-ball head coach from 2012 to 2014 and Andy Flower lasered his focus on the Test team. While the volume of cricket is one reason for another attempt at this separation of coaching, Key chiefly believes the requirements of the two teams are so different now as to leave little option; while the Test team has bottomed out, the white-ball side is in a healthier state under Eoin Morgan’s captaincy. That said, England cannot be complacent about the latter with a T20 World Cup in November and the team’s 50-over title defence next year. With Morgan now 35 and having made just one half century in his last 24 international innings, the appointment here may need to factor the needs of the next captain also. Paul Collingwood, who led both legs of England’s recent Caribbean tour, is a contender but the nature of the role – a deeper talent pool than the Test set-up and a schedule that is likely to permit a second job coaching in the Indian Premier League – means the former all-rounder’s ascension is not a given. Both the Test and white-ball head coaches will need to show they are “accomplished strategists with clear and ambitious plans” and must develop “a playing style and culture that inspires future generations of players and supporters” although prior international experience is only “desirable”. While both appointments will play “a central role in selecting the team for their respective format”, the role of national selector is expected to be restored and have the final say when allocating multi-format players.",Sport/Sport,Rob Key advertises for separate Test and white-ball England head coaches,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/apr/26/rob-key-advertises-for-separate-test-and-white-ball-england-head-coaches
4/27/2022,"The hormone replacement therapy (HRT) supply crisis must be resolved quickly because “so many women” are experiencing distress and some are risking serious side effects by using medication prescribed to others, the UK’s most senior GP has warned. There have been acute shortages of some HRT products, which are used by about 1 million women in the UK to treat symptoms of the menopause. Some women have turned to the black market or are meeting up with other women in carparks to buy, swap or share medicines. Prof Martin Marshall, the chair of the Royal College of GPs, told the Guardian that action was required urgently to resolve the crisis. “The college is concerned to see supply issues around the provision of HRT, and we understand the distress this is causing to so many women,” he said. “It is really important that this is resolved as quickly as possible. “We are hearing that the supply issue is specific to England, as there has been a big rise in the demand for oestrogen, particularly transdermal, we use. There is not the same problem with the supply of some of the other oral preparations which are appropriate for many women in the UK and give good symptom relief.” Thousands of GPs across the country are being briefed about which products are available to enable them to help women who may need to be prescribed a substitute, Marshall said. However, he also raised concerns over women sharing HRT products with others who are struggling to obtain medicines as a result of the supply problems. “While we appreciate the seriousness of the current situation and the frustrations women are experiencing, we urge them not to share HRT medication as this could lead to serious side-effects.” The Guardian revealed on Monday that supply shortages have been so severe that some women have been forced to travel hundreds of miles in search of HRT products. Health experts are increasingly concerned about the mounting impact of the issue on women’s physical and mental health. “The impact the HRT shortage is having on so many women cannot and should not be underestimated,” said Dr Martin Kinsella, a hormone expert. “I’ve heard of women buying HRT on the black market and in doing so putting their own safety at risk, and some whose mental health as well as physical health has suffered hugely due to this shortage.” Dee Murray, the CEO and founder of the Menopause Experts group, said: “The HRT shortage is causing stress and potential harm for women, with some pushed to take matters into their own hands and look for supplies online. This could have a devastating impact on their health, as HRT should only be prescribed by qualified healthcare practitioners who understand the patient’s history.” Sajid Javid has been urged to change the law to let pharmacists alter prescriptions during medicine shortages. Claire Anderson, the president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, told the Guardian community pharmacists should be able to dispense substitute versions of medicines on prescription without having to contact the prescriber – typically a GP – every time. Currently, the law in England stipulates they must provide only the exact prescription. Javid, the health secretary, has said he was “determined” to resolve the crisis and intends to use lessons learned during the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, as well as appointing an HRT supply tsar.",News/Society,"Women risking their health to source HRT amid shortages, UK GP chief warns",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/26/women-risking-their-health-to-source-hrt-amid-shortages-uk-gp-chief-warns
4/27/2022,"1956 was a memorable year for both Manchester City and Real Madrid. That June, Madrid won the inaugural edition of the hot, new, pan-European club football competition Li’l Cup – look how li’l! – while a month before in May, City triumphed in the FA Cup final, Bert Trautmann’s neck, Don Revie cosplaying as Nandor Hidegkuti, all that. Real immediately built on their success and by the mid-60s had conquered Europe on another five occasions. City also moved on, and by this time found themselves in the Second Division losing at home to Swindon in front of 8,015 fans. Of course they did. Oh old-school City! You’ll always have a very special place in everyone’s heart. However, just as a week is a long time in politics, 57 years are a long time in football. And look at everyone now! Li’l Cup is all grown up; Madrid have 13 wins on their resumé; and City … well, they’ve still to taste the ultimate in European glory, but they’re now the richest club in the world, winning the Premier League is like shelling peas, and the big one in Europe, the one everyone insists they’re not that bothered about but come off it and come on, is surely just a matter of time. Hey, they’d have probably already won it had Kevin De Bruyne not had the contours of his skull rearranged free of charge in last year’s final. Ah, how the entire course of history can be changed by such tiny, strangely downplayed, brazen bodychecks. City’s luck has to change soon, surely, not least because Pep Guardiola has been busy instilling the sort of relentless winning mentality that was signally missing round Maine Road way in 1957. “That’s why big clubs stay there for a long time,” Pep explained. “When you win, take a shower and go again. We are learning that.” And what better test of their new resolve than a Big Cup semi-final against Real? “We are playing a team who have been here many times, that’s why they have this history and we don’t. If we have to compete with history, we don’t have any chance … but it’s 11 v 11.” Three huge crunch matches away from glory, then, with the first of them transmitted live in the UK on BT Sport, a niche channel which regularly pulls in audiences of 8,015 viewers and sometimes even more.

4/27/2022,"Yuga Labs, the multibillion-dollar collective behind the infamous Bored Ape Yacht Club non-fungible tokens, has been targeted by another hacking attack, leading to the theft of millions of dollars worth of the simian NFTs. BAYC’s series of algorithmically generated cartoon ape profile pictures is one of the best-known collections of NFTs – a digital asset or artwork whose ownership is stored on a blockchain, a decentralised ledger of transactions like those used by cryptocurrencies. The attacker seized control of the BAYC Instagram account and sent a phishing post that many followers were fooled into clicking on, connecting their crypto wallets to the hacker’s “smart contract” – a mechanism for implementing a crypto transaction. That enabled the attacker to steal the assets held in the wallets, seizing control of four Bored Apes, as well as a host of other NFTs with an estimated total value of $3m. “Instagram attacks are nothing new but often take an element of social engineering,” said Jake Moore, global cybersecurity adviser at the security firm ESET. “Unfortunately, however, this takeover has had a huge consequence and resulted in a mass robbery of digital assets. Similar to when physical art is stolen, there will be questions over how they would now be able to sell on these assets, but the problems in NFTs still prevail and users must remain extremely cautious of this still very new technology.” As one of the most prominent NFT collections, with celebrity owners including Eminem, Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna, BAYC holders are often targeted for attacks, with greater or lesser technical significance. In early April, for instance, one pseudonymous owner, “s27”, lost a $500,000 ape collection after being tricked into swapping it for, effectively, counterfeits: the scammer created new NFTs that were visually identical to BAYC pictures except they had a green tick over them – mimicking the “verified” icon of the platform used for the trade. In December, another Ape holder, the New York art dealer Todd Kramer, disclosed his own $2.2m loss with the tweet, “I been hacked. All my apes gone. This just sold please help me.” Kramer, who had fallen prey to a similar phishing scam, managed to recover a portion of his stolen Apes with the help of the NFT trading platform OpenSea – but not before the phrase “all my apes gone” was widely mocked online among those who doubt the substance of the NFT fad. The BAYC creators said in a statement: “Yuga Labs and Instagram are currently investigating how the hacker was able to gain access to the account. Two-factor authentication was enabled and the security practices surrounding the IG account were tight.” Hacking and theft are rife in the crypto sector. Transactions are irreversible once made, and it can take a high degree of skill to read the contents of a smart contract and determine whether it is malicious or valid before giving it access to an account. Last week, a “stablecoin” project called Beanstalk lost $180m to a “governance” attack, where the attacker used an instant loan to buy control of the project, transfer its reserves to their account, and then repay the loan in just 13 seconds. And earlier this month, a North Korean hacking outfit named Lazarus stole more than half a billion dollars-worth of crypto tokens from the video game Axie Infinity. Despite the hack being recorded on the blockchain, which keeps all transactions public, the state-sponsored hackers appear to have successfully laundered nearly $100m of the stolen funds already, largely by using a decentralised money-laundering service called Tornado Cash.",News/Technology,Hack on Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs leads to $3m simian oblivion,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/26/bored-ape-yacht-club-nft-hack-theft-art-simian-oblivion
4/27/2022,"An MP found guilty this month of molesting a 15-year-old boy advised the government on child sexual exploitation while under police caution, the Guardian can disclose. Imran Ahmad Khan, the then Conservative MP for Wakefield, joined an expert panel offering advice on grooming gangs and went on to contribute to a policy paper entitled “Group-based child sexual exploitation characteristics of offending”. He attended online meetings with the panel of sexual exploitation experts in July, September and November of 2020. Staffordshire police say he gave a written statement under caution in May 2020 addressing claims he had assaulted a minor. The disclosures raise serious questions for the government and the Home Office over why he was appointed to a panel addressing child protection while under police investigation. His involvement on the panel was disclosed publicly by the home secretary, Priti Patel, in December 2020 – a year after his victim said he had told the Conservative party about being abused in his own home. The latest disclosures about Khan, who was expelled from the Conservatives after his conviction earlier this month, also raise questions for the party, which failed to record and then inform the Home Office about the molestation claims they received in 2019. A Conservative party spokesperson said: “We have found no record of this complaint.” A Home Office spokesperson said that neither Patel nor the Home Office were aware of the claims against Khan before they were made public in 2021. “In his role as an MP, Mr Khan was asked along with several others to peer review a Home Office research paper. The Home Office was not aware of the allegations against him at the time and he no longer has any involvement with the department.” Responding to the disclosures, the Labour shadow cabinet minister, Louise Haigh, said the government should explain why it appointed Khan to the panel and if he was a malign influence on the official government report into child abuse. “Khan’s victim told the Conservatives about sickening sexual abuse, and they did nothing, and then shamefully appointed him to sit alongside survivors of child sexual exploitation.” “How could they possibly have put victims and survivors in this position?” “The Tories have serious questions to answer over how they gave this man free rein to exploit his position and victims of abuse. Boris Johnson and Priti Patel need to come clean about what the Conservative party knew and how they could possibly have put victims in this horrifying position in the first place,” she said. Khan was elected in November 2019. A few days earlier, his victim, then 24, says he called the Conservative party and told them about the abuse he had suffered at the hands of Khan, the trial heard. The assault took place in January 2008 when Khan was 34 and prior to him becoming an MP. Khan tried to force the 15-year-old to drink alcohol before sexually assaulting him in a house in Staffordshire. The boy immediately told his parents about the sexual assault. The victim reported the assault to Staffordshire police soon after the incident but then decided he did not want to pursue the case further. The victim said he contacted the Conservative party press office in 2019 to inform them of his claims of child abuse against Khan. “I wasn’t taken very seriously,” he told the court in evidence. He said the woman he spoke to sounded “shocked” and passed him on to someone else who sounded more “stern” and asked if he had any “proof”. “I said, ‘Yes, there’s a police report’ and she said, ‘Well …’, and that was it. “I said, ‘I’m going to the police’, and she said, ‘Well, you do that’.” After Khan had been elected as the MP for Wakefield, the victim decided to pursue the complaint as he was concerned that Khan was not fit to be in public office, he told the court. Staffordshire police then launched an inquiry into Khan, sending him a questionnaire about the incident in line with Covid restrictions. Khan replied with a statement under caution in May 2020, a police spokesperson said. Patel told parliament in December 2020 that Khan was one of 12 people who were members of the external reference group (ERG), consisting of independent experts on child sexual exploitation. “An external reference group, consisting of independent experts on child sexual exploitation, reviewed and informed this work. Members included the Labour MP for Rotherham Sarah Champion [and] Conservative MP for Wakefield Imran Ahmad Khan,” she said. The group convened three online meetings to discuss the paper, the report said, and provided “ongoing written and verbal guidance to the Home Office on its content and findings”. “The ERG’s comments have proved invaluable in shaping it into a document that sets out the full extent of our current, collective knowledge on this topic, as well as setting direction for areas of future work,” the report said. Khan was charged in 2021 and subsequently found guilty and has been warned he faces a jail sentence. He has said he will resign from his seat but so far he has not.",News/Politics,Ex-Tory MP guilty of molesting boy was on panel advising on grooming gangs,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/apr/26/ex-tory-mp-guilty-of-molesting-boy-was-on-panel-advising-on-grooming-gangs
4/27/2022,"One day, when Boris Johnson is no longer prime minister and the full catalogue of his frauds is compiled, a special place will belong to one that got him elected in the first place. Before he attended any lockdown parties, before there were pandemic rules to break or lies to tell about the breakage, there was the promise to Get Brexit Done. It is not done. That is why Johnson’s government is drafting a law that would give ministers the power to override the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit deal. This is the very treaty that Johnson hailed as “great”, “excellent”, a fulfilment of all his negotiating ambitions. If that were true, he would not now be planning to set it on fire. Sound familiar? It should do. It is the latest sequel in a hackneyed franchise with a formulaic plot. In the Brexiteer imagination it is an action adventure movie. Brussels has taken a portion of UK sovereignty hostage. Plucky Boris must go in, all guns blazing, to retrieve it. In such escapades of derring-do, playing by the rules and respecting treaties is for remoaner softies. A recap from previous episodes: to avoid reimposing a hard border on the island of Ireland, a special customs regime was agreed for the North that requires checks on some goods crossing from the British mainland. Johnson signed up to this. Ministers now claim it was never meant to be a permanent solution, by which they mean Johnson lied to his European counterparts as well as his voters. He never intended to honour the deal. Until now, the government’s agitation has been expressed by fingering, but never quite pulling, the trigger on article 16 – the break clause written into the Brexit deal. But article 16 is a route to more negotiation and mediation within the scope of the treaty itself. It is a conventional weapon. The new device being assembled in the Downing Street bunker goes nuclear. Will it be detonated? Veterans of past Brexit wars will be familiar with the cost-benefit equation. It comes down to a test of where Johnson thinks his short-term self-interest lies. The theory is that it takes a proper crisis for Brussels to take notice of British grievance. Currently, the EU is addressing the Northern Ireland question in technical, legal terms, via the commission. Johnson wants to escalate it to a deal between political leaders. He thinks a British prime minister shouldn’t have to haggle with bureaucrats. He should be stitching something up with Paris and Berlin. That’s how it worked in the old days. But in the old days Britain was a member of the EU. That isn’t how it works for “third countries”. A downside to confrontation is that it would be divisive at a time when western nations are striving for solidarity over Russia’s attack on Ukraine. On that front, Johnson thinks his credentials as a stalwart friend of Kyiv are sufficiently well established – and noted in Washington – that he has wriggle room to make demands over Northern Ireland, a subject on which the Americans might previously have slapped him down. But status as the most pro-Ukrainian leader in the room doesn’t get Johnson as far as he thinks in Brussels, where he isn’t in the actual room. He needs goodwill from Emmanuel Macron to shift diplomatic dials for him on the European council. The French president, with a newly acquired domestic mandate but a lot of trouble in his in-tray, won’t spend any political capital doing favours for a man he mistrusts, having dealt with him before. The prime minister has never been one for cultivating foreign alliances, since it requires consistency and reliability. His interests are more parochial. Also, wounded by Partygate, his focus is now on the bare-knuckle fight for survival. To that end, a conflagration of EU issues might help to thaw relations with the rightwing faction that traditionally settles the fate of Tory leaders. It would irritate moderate MPs, but they aren’t as ruthless or as organised. No rival for the leadership will risk criticising an act of hardline Brexit revivalism. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, fancies the top job and is notionally in charge of negotiations over Northern Ireland. She would not have chosen a manoeuvre as wantonly vandalistic as the protocol override bill, but she is said to be reconciled to the move. The chancellor has previously been an obstacle whenever No 10 has wanted to pick fights with Brussels, channelling Treasury anxiety about the cost of a trade war. But Rishi Sunak is badly diminished by recent political missteps around tax – the ones he raised for voters and the ones his non-domiciled spouse avoided paying. Johnson no longer sees him as a threat. Cabinet has not discussed the plan to sabotage the Brexit deal in law. Much depends on elections next week. The Stormont assembly poll in Northern Ireland could trigger a crisis by making Sinn Féin the largest party. Unionists would then lose the right to name the first minister – a loss of political primacy that would be mostly symbolic, but culturally intolerable for that reason. Meanwhile, if council elections in England reveal massive discontent with Johnson, Tory MPs may be spurred to move against him. Then there would be double temptation to go all in with a Brexit bust-up. Johnson would say that only scrapping the protocol could ease tensions in Northern Ireland (although in reality the election there will probably show a majority in favour of keeping it). The override law might not even need to be passed. The prime minister would be most interested in the spectacle – a battle with Brussels, obstruction in the House of Lords, the fulminations of remain-supporting liberals; a fireworks display to get the old Eurosceptic core vote ooh-ing and ah-ing in appreciation, just like the old days. Would it work? Probably not. The pledge to Get Brexit Done had such breadth of appeal because it raised hope of ending the toxic, self-involved national drama over an issue that most people had not considered all that important before a choice was forced on them in a referendum. Only a fanatical minority misses the fight enough to restart it. And today’s Johnson has lost the knack that his former self had for turning crisis into carnival. His levity no longer gets him leniency from an audience that has heard just a few too many lies. Still, there would be a certain tidy symmetry if his downfall included a Brexit bill that offered false resolution to a crisis without end; his last great dishonesty in office being a mirror of the first.

You’re digging in.” Atmosphere, attention and the uneasy sense that all is not quite well are crucial to Fish’s vision of Oklahoma!, a musical that is more often rendered as a cosy romance of pioneer living and manifest destiny. His raw revival has been honed over more than a decade – Fish first conjured it with a student cast in upstate New York in 2007 – and it arrives at London’s Young Vic with two Tony awards. With a set featuring an unnerving number of guns, and an ending that needed special negotiations with the Rodgers and Hammerstein estate, this is not a Kansas City cornbread-caper. Critics acclaimed its visceral connection to the story’s deeper themes of death and desire, borne out in a sensual modern dance solo, in place of the traditional dream ballet, and a usually comic song filmed live and projected in unsettling darkness. A proscenium-arch adaptation is now touring the US in 1,000-seater venues, but this production returns the show to the kind of intimate space for which it was conceived, with singers draped on trestle tables within touching distance. “There’s nowhere to hide,” says Fish, and you get the sense that he’s not just referring to the performers. When the show was performed off-Broadway in 2018, chilli was served to the audience, a meal that emphasised the communality – and, when the plot darkens, complicity – of everyone in the room together. Covid protocols have done away with that, although Fish doesn’t mind. “That was never the most important thing. We have been trying to pare it down, make it more essential.” It was not his aim, he says, to confront the folksy tradition of the piece, only to free himself and his cast from any assumptions they might hold about it. That is, of course, a different prospect with a mostly British company. It will be interesting, says Fish, to see how the themes of gun violence and racial tension will resonate in the UK. “There’s a tendency in culture to tell people what they’re going to see. But I think people go to the theatre to find out what is going to happen. It’s the Laurie Anderson thing, ‘What is behind that curtain?’” Anderson is a natural touchstone for Fish, whose CV reflects a similar love of multimedia, performance art and the avant garde. One of his works saw an ensemble recite selections of David Foster Wallace’s writing while tennis balls were thrown around them. Another involved two actors being filmed as they performed the final scene of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 23 times in a row. Fish doesn’t see himself “at an experimental edge, or anything like that” but does acknowledge inspirations in a number of boundary-pushing auteurs, from film-makers Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Chantal Akerman, to the Berlin Volksbühne theatre’s Frank Castorf. It’s also notable that his work has not skewed any more towards the commercial since his Oklahoma! hit the big time. “People said ‘Everything’s going to change for you,’ but I’ve never been that kind of director,” he laughs. “I’m very happy for the success and I think it’s allowed me to be a little clearer when I need something, and make a demand. But I try to tune that noise out.” Patrick Vaill, reprising his role as Jud Fry, has worked with Fish for 13 years – he was a 21-year-old student actor in the original staging. “So much of what makes this piece special is that we’re not pretending to be these other characters, we’re revealing who we are,” says Vaill, during a break in rehearsal. “And that’s exhausting! But as the piece has grown, so have we. Daniel and I have gone through a lot of life in that time, and the world has gone through a lot, too.” This Oklahoma! has played through four US presidencies, from George W Bush to Joe Biden. It will now open against the backdrop of war in Europe, as well as a more personal tragedy for the company. Last month Barbara Maier Gustern, the singing coach who helped shaped the show’s sound, died after a random street attack. “There’s a lot of indiscriminate violence in New York, a real instability,” says Fish. “People aren’t OK.” Given all this, Fish admits to “complicated feelings” about creating work. There were even nerves about whether he might struggle to re-engage with a show he has been staging and restaging for the past seven years. “I think there’s always a bit of fear that it’s not going to be interesting,” he says. “But as soon as I came here I was like, ‘Oh!’ My love for the material remains.”  Oklahoma! is at the Young Vic, London, from 27 April to 25 June.",Arts/Stage,Oh what a gun-totin’ morning: raw Oklahoma! swaps folksiness for firearms,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/apr/26/oklahoma-firearms-rogers-hammerstein-daniel-fish-gun-violence-racial-tension
