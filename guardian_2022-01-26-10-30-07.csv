1/26/2022,"New Zealand’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern has said “at no point was I worried about my safety” after her van was chased and forced on to a curb by anti-vaccination protesters. Footage of the incident, which took place last week, was posted to social media in recent days. It shows protesters shouting slogans at the van, including “shame on you,” and “we do not consent”. A person filming inside a car is heard saying “there’s Jacinda” and “​​Oh this is fun, we’re on a chase.” The car pursues the prime minister’s van and at one point someone inside calls the prime minister “a Nazi” and shouts various obscenities. As their vehicle tries to block the van, the van is forced on to the curb to avoid it, then continues on.  Asked about the incident on Tuesday afternoon, Ardern said it was “just another day”. “At no point was I worried about my safety or the safety of anyone that was with me,” she said. “Every day is faced with new and different experiences in this job … We are in an environment at the moment that does have an intensity to it that is unusual for New Zealand. I do also believe that with time it will pass.” The incident comes amid a small but notable rise in threats against politicians and public figures involved in the pandemic response in New Zealand. According to police data released under the official information act to 1News this week, threats towards MPs reached a three-year high in one month last year. Threats to politicians serious enough to trigger a report to police are still relatively rare in New Zealand, reaching an average of about five a month toward the end of 2021, but sometimes spiking to 16 a month. NZ Police told 1 News the incidents included threats to injure, harm and assassinate politicians, including one person who had threatened to send a bomb to parliament. Ardern said on Tuesday that being subject to these kinds of incidents was part of the job. “I see that as just being a reflection of the fact that we are the decision makers. And if people don’t like the decisions that are being made, then it’s us that of course will hear the feedback about that.” In late 2021, New Zealand’s parliament stepped up security measures after reports from MPs that they were being targeted for harassment by anti-vaxxers, and parliamentary services added a small budget to help MPs change locks or security systems. Covid response minister and leader of the house Chris Hipkins told the Guardian in November that one of his electoral offices had been subject to repeated attacks from anti-vaxxers, and that he had stepped up security. Having to adopt additional security measures ran counter to the highly accessible government that New Zealand valued, he said. “I’ve always believed that New Zealand parliamentarians being as accessible as we are is something special about New Zealand, and I’m generally reluctant to see that change,” Hipkins said last November. “The actions of a small group of individuals is the problem here, and it would be sad to see the openness of our democracy being undermined by a small group of vocal and aggressive people.” The vast majority of New Zealanders have supported the country’s vaccination drive, with close to 95% of adults vaccinated. But some have strongly resisted either vaccination itself, or the mandates that have accompanied it: with about 40% of the country’s workforce are covered by vaccine mandates. Under current regulations, people without a vaccine pass cannot dine indoors, or visit high-contact businesses like hairdressers and gyms. The New Zealand police had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication. The prime minister’s office has also been approached for comment.",News/World news,New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern shrugs off car chase by anti-vaccination protesters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/jacinda-ardern-shrugs-off-car-chase-by-anti-vaccination-protesters
1/26/2022,"The new Australian of the Year, Dylan Alcott, has joined calls for people with disability to be given free rapid antigen tests, arguing it would help them take part in society as the country opens up. Alcott, a tennis champion and the first person with a visible disability to be awarded the gong, also used his acceptance speech on Tuesday night to emphasise the importance of fully funding the national disability insurance scheme (NDIS).  After Guardian Australia reported many people with disability were receiving no federal support for rapid tests, the Morrison government this week announced it would allow NDIS participants to dip into their core funding to buy the devices. But the decision was met with a mixed response because, although participants would no longer be out of pocket, they would be required to use funding otherwise allocated for support. On Wednesday, Alcott expanded on his call for free tests for people with disability in an interview on ABC Radio National. “We’re always talking [to] people with multiple disabilities about what they need,” he said of his consulting firm, which hires people with disability. “Especially for people who are immunocompromised and vulnerable at the moment – first of all how good that Australia is opening up – but when you go to think about it, it’s actually quite scary. “Because they are worried that if they do get Covid they’re going to be in trouble. If somebody needs a free daily rapid test for them and their family and their carers so they can feel confident to get out and live their life, we’ve got to give them that. Straight away.” The government’s announcement to allow NDIS participants to dip into their funding was “cautiously” welcomed by the peak body, People With Disability Australia. But it added it was “concerned that the government is requiring NDIS participants to source their own Rats and to spend their core funding”. “This funding is already allocated to pay for reasonable and necessary disability supports,” People With Disability Australia said. “Rats should be free for all people with disability.” Labor has called for free rapid tests for all under the Medicare system, but the government has rejected the idea. Instead, it has created a scheme that allows concession card holders to obtain 10 free tests over three months from pharmacies. About 18% of NDIS participants are ineligible for the scheme. Last week, Guardian Australia revealed that while NDIS participants living in group homes and their providers could claim the cost of Rats, those residing in their own homes could not. Among them is Carolyn Campbell-McLean, who has a form of muscular dystrophy that means she is unable to cough or blow her nose by herself. She told Guardian Australia she had already spent $1,300 on rapid tests for her support workers. Under the government’s new policy, she will now be able to claim back that money, which will be subtracted from her “core funding”. Another man, Max Burt, who had spent about $1,000 on rapid tests for his support workers, noted access was still an issue. Some people with disability were unable to shop around at pharmacies to find one with tests in stock. Alcott also called on the government to “guarantee” the NDIS would be fully funded. While the Morrison government has pledged to do so, it has also increasingly raised concerns about the cost of the scheme, and was last year forced to ditch reforms advocates believed were aimed at cost-cutting. “I’ve been talking about the NDIS with the government for years,” Alcott said. “It is fully funded, but it’s got to be guaranteed, forever. Without the NDIS so many people with disability can’t be the people they want to be. “They can’t get the care they need, first and foremost, get the resources they need, the equipment they need to get out there and start living their life. To get out and get a job, to get out and so their families can stop caring for them and they can go out and get a job.” Alcott noted only about 500,000 of the 4.5 million people in Australia with a disability were on the NDIS. “They need support too, so they can be the people they want to be,” he said.",News/Australia news,Dylan Alcott: Australian of the Year calls for people with disability to be given free rapid antigen tests,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/26/dylan-alcott-australian-of-the-year-calls-for-people-with-disability-to-be-given-free-rapid-antigen-tests
