1/24/2022,"Following the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, thousands of people fled from the victorious communist forces by sailing to neighbouring countries. When these “boat people” attempted to land in Singapore, the police pushed them back out to sea, where many died. In 1978 the Vietnamese Zen Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, who has died aged 95, went to Singapore for a conference on religion and peace. By working with fishermen he helped get provisions to those at sea and smuggle some refugees ashore; he then took them to the French embassy compound so that the next morning they could surrender to the police and enter the official arrival system.  When Nhat Hanh was arrested and threatened with deportation, hundreds were put in peril. He reflected: “If I could not be peaceful in the midst of danger, the peace I might realise in easier times would not mean anything.” Despite the pressure, Nhat Hanh and his colleagues did some walking meditation, and got the idea of asking the French ambassador to write a letter for them to take to the prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew. After a cabinet meeting they were granted 10 more days, which they used to wind up the operation. Nhat Hanh pointed to this as an example of “engaged Buddhism”, where mindfulness – “the capacity to be aware of what is going on, and what is there” – forms the basis for offering practical help to address the issues and injustices of the modern world. Through developing a movement to promote it in the west as well as in Asia, he did much to bring the practice of mindfulness into the social mainstream, by emphasising that a contemplative attitude could inform every moment of the day, not just those devoted to explicit meditation. His philosophy of “interbeing”, which holds that we should regard ourselves as interconnected parts of the fabric of life, rather than as separate entities, has been an important influence on many environmentalists. Christiana Figueres, the executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that she could not have achieved the Paris agreement of 2016 “if I had not been accompanied by the teachings of Thich Nhat Hanh”. He was also an influential advocate for nonviolence. A group of imprisoned Sinn Féin leaders adopted his teachings and, having become elected politicians, in 2012 invited him to address the Stormont Assembly. At the height of the war between communist North Vietnam and US-supported South Vietnam in 1966, Nhat Hanh travelled to the US “to tell Americans of Vietnam’s suffering”. He met academic, religious and political leaders, including the Catholic author Thomas Merton and defence secretary Robert McNamara, and argued persuasively for a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. Largely due to Nhat Han’s influence, Martin Luther King declared his opposition to the war, and later that year nominated Nhat Hanh for the Nobel peace prize, writing: “Thich Nhat Hanh offers a solution acceptable to rational leaders … His ideas for peace, if applied, would build a monument to ecumenism, to world brotherhood, to humanity.” However, King breached protocol (and perhaps offended the Nobel committee) by publishing the nomination letter, and no award was made. In Europe Nhat Hanh met Pope Paul VI to urge cooperation between Buddhists and Catholics in Vietnam, and in 1969 he established the Buddhist peace delegation at the Paris peace talks. After the 1973 peace accords Nhat Hanh was refused permission to return to Vietnam and instead embarked on a new sphere of activity as a Buddhist teacher in the west. With Sister Chan Khong he established a meditation centre aouth-east of Paris, and in 1982 he founded Plum Village in the Dordogne, in south-west France – now home to more than 200 nuns and monks - as a base. The thousands of meditation practitioners who visited the various Plum Village centres in Europe, the US, Australia and Asia knew him by the name of Thay. In 1987 a disciple founded a small publishing house that printed Being Peace, a book of his writings. With little promotion the book quickly sold 100,000 and was followed by other bestselling titles such as The Sun My Heart, and Old Path, White Clouds – a novelised life of the Buddha. Nhat Hanh has written more than 100 books, many of them available in English, including poetry, meditation teaching and advice for activists. Born Nguyen Xuan Bao in Hue, central Vietnam, he entered a monastery aged 16 and received the name Nhat Hanh at his full ordination in 1949 – Thich is a title used by Vietnamese monks. From the start of his monastic life, Nhat Hanh combined meditation practice with social action and scholarship – he became fluent in eight languages – and by the age of 30 he was editing a journal that urged Buddhism to modernise and oppose both the war and South Vietnam’s dictatorship. In 1961 he went to the US to study, and taught comparative religion at Princeton and Columbia universities. Three years later he returned to Vietnam. Buddhism was widely respected as a grassroots alternative to communism, capitalism and the war, but it lacked means to translate this prestige into social change. In short order, Nhat Hanh founded the Van Hanh Buddhist University, a publishing house, the School of Youth for Social Service (SYSS), and the Order of Interbeing – a lay organisation based on the combination of social action and mindful awareness. The South Vietnamese government declared that anyone promoting “neutralism” would be considered pro-Communist, and many of Nhat Hanh’s colleagues were killed, while he narrowly survived an assassination attempt. Despite this, by the end of the war the SYSS included 10,000 monks and lay people who travelled into the countryside to establish schools and clinics and rebuild villages. In later years Nhat Hanh’s life mirrored that of other Buddhist leaders in the west – writing, leading retreats and guiding the development of the Order of Interbeing, which grew into an international Buddhist movement with several hundred monks, and many more lay teachers and practice communities. On his return visits to Vietnam in 2005 and 2007 Nhat Hanh was greeted warmly by ordinary Buddhists, but leaders of the outlawed United Buddhist Church – some of whom had been under house arrest for decades – refused to meet him, arguing that his visit would legitimise repression of Buddhism. Nhat Hanh’s teaching combined traditional Zen meditation practices with others drawn from Theravada Buddhism. His principle of engaged Buddhism expressed his belief that meditative calm must be tested in the midst of conflict: “Other people can occupy your country, they can even put you in prison, but they cannot take away your true home and your freedom.” In 2014 he had a stroke. He moved to Thailand in late 2016 and two years later returned to Vietnam. There he received traditional medicine treatments for the after-effects of his stroke at the Tu Hieu Pagoda, the monastery in Hue where he had been ordained.

1/24/2022,"Faster internet access has “significantly” weakened civic participation in Britain and may have fuelled populism, a new study suggests after it found involvement in political parties, trade unions and volunteering fell as web speeds rose. Volunteering in social care fell by more than 10% when people lived closer to local telecoms exchange hubs and so enjoyed faster web access. Involvement in political parties fell by 19% with every 1.8km increase in proximity to a hub. By contrast, the arrival of fast internet had no significant impact on interactions with family and friends.  The analysis of behaviour among hundreds of thousands of people led by academics from Cardiff University and Sapienza University of Rome found faster connection speeds may have reduced the likelihood of civic engagement among close to 450,000 people – more than double the estimated membership of the Conservative party. They found that, as internet speeds rose between 2005 and 2018, time online “crowded out” other forms of civic engagement. The study’s authors have speculated that the phenomenon may have helped fuel populism as people’s involvement with initiatives for “the common good”, which are effectively “schools of democracy” where people learn the benefit of cooperation, has declined. Other studies have shown that social media engagement has strengthened other kinds of civic engagement, for example by helping to organise protests and fuelling an interest in politics, even if it does not manifest in traditional forms of participation. However, politics conducted online has been found to be more susceptible to “filter bubbles”, which limit participants’ exposure to opposing views and so foster polarisation. “We observed that civic participation and the form of engagement in the activities of voluntary organisations and political participation declined with proximity to the network,” said Fabio Sabatini, co-author of the study. “Fast internet seems to crowd out this kind of social engagement.” Face-to-face volunteering in the UK has been in decline for substantial periods in recent history. It fell from 2005 to 2011 and again in 2020 as Covid-19 hit, according to separate analysis by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. The new study, published in the Journal of Public Economics, gathered information from the communications regulator Ofcom about the location of local internet cabling exchanges, which during the period studied were a key determinant of data speeds. It then cross-referenced this with residents’ survey responses from the British Household Panel Survey and the UK Household Longitudinal Study about their engagement with social organisations. The combined effect on engagement with organisations such as political parties, unions and professional associations was a 6% reduction in participation from 2010 to 2017 for each 1.8km closer to the local exchange someone lived. The biggest impact was on political party involvement, while the impact on trade unions was far smaller – a 3.6% reduction. That chimes with estimates of declining membership of the main UK parties over the period studied, with the exception of a spike caused by a surge in Labour membership before Jeremy Corbyn’s election as party leader in 2015. The decline in political parties’ appeal when internet speeds rise compared with unions may be because “political parties only indirectly safeguard their supporters’ particular interests [while] trade unions have a stronger and more explicit commitment to advocate for … their members,” the study suggested. The effect on volunteering with organisations that deliver social care and environmental improvements as well as the Scouts, which have been defined by sociologists as instilling “habits of cooperation, solidarity, and public-spiritedness”, was measured at a 7.8% reduction. “These kinds of organisations have been defined as ‘schools of democracy’ where people learn the benefit of cooperation” Sabatini said, adding that involvement with such organisations also helps people to trust strangers. “The rise of populism has been linked to a decline in interest in public affairs and we thought that, being less politically and socially active, people may be less capable of interpreting political phenomena and understanding the complexity of the management of public affairs,” Sabatini said. “While bonding social capital [family and friends] seems resilient to technological change, bridging social capital [politics, volunteering, unions] proves fragile and vulnerable to the pressure of technology,” the study concluded. “This result is disturbing as it suggests that progress in information and communications technology can undermine an essential factor of economic activity and the functioning of democratic institutions.”",News/Politics,Faster internet speeds linked to lower civic engagement in UK,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/internet-access-decline-civic-engagement-uk
1/24/2022,"On a weekend where complaining golfers were hardly difficult to come by, Thomas Pieters delivered a timely redemption tale. Tyrrell Hatton made his feelings regarding this venue, Yas Links, perfectly clear. On the PGA Tour, Jon Rahm was filmed lambasting a “piece of shit setup” in California. Enter Pieters, who expressed glee at returning to the forefront of his sport after a period in the wilderness.  Four days short of his 30th birthday, Pieters reminded us of the form that once took him into the world’s top 50, a tie for fourth at the Masters and into Europe’s 2016 Ryder Cup team with a one-stroke victory at the Abu Dhabi Championship. A fourth round of 72 saw Pieters claim the biggest victory of his career, at 10 under par, from Rafa Cabrera-Bello and Shubhankar Sharma. “I disappeared for a couple of years, I guess,” said Pieters. “I’m so happy to be back. As a golfer, top 50 in the world is your strive point and when I jumped out maybe three years ago, I took it badly. I’m happy to be back again.” Pieters needed a par five at the last to prevail and recorded one with relative ease. “Stuff like this inspires kids,” said the big-hitting Belgian. “Hopefully I can do that back home.” Hatton doubled down on fierce criticism of the 18th hole here from Saturday, when he took nine at the par five. Asked what he thought when walking onto the same tee on day four, the defending champion replied: “That I would love for a bomb to drop on it and blow it up to oblivion to be honest. It’s just such a terrible finishing hole. “And the fact that they moved the tee back today is ridiculous. I hit a really good tee shot and still had 290 yards to the front [of the green]. I could pick driver up again and still not get there. It would be a much better finishing hole if you’re actually rewarded for hitting the fairway which, as it stands, you’re not.” There was more. Hatton won this event at Abu Dhabi Golf Club, meaning his desire for it to return there is perhaps logical. “Also, this place for spectators is just awful,” Hatton added. “Seeing where the rope lines are and where spectators have to walk, it wouldn’t be surprising to hear a lot of people have hurt their ankles and all sorts this week. “For that alone, the other course is way better. It’s a much nicer course for spectators, and viewing points, as well.” Hatton’s admission that he “perhaps” might not be back should Yas Links retain the tournament felt like an understatement. Rory McIlroy burst through the field and briefly threatened to produce an unlikely victory before coming unstuck from the 14th onwards. Until then, McIlroy was six under for the day and just two from the lead. He holed his second shot from 141 yards for an eagle at the 9th. Late stumbles meant McIlroy played his final five in three over and had to settle for a share of 12th. “I will take the positives from the first 13 and learn from the loose shoots I hit coming in,” McIlroy said. “I had to make a birdie at the last on Friday night just to be here for the weekend and almost made the most of that. I played well yesterday. It was good to see where the game’s at. It was good to get an extra couple of days’ golf going to Dubai next week. Obviously it wasn’t the finish I wanted today but, big picture-wise, it was good to get another couple of days to play 36 holes.”",Sport/Sport,Thomas Pieters earns biggest career victory at Abu Dhabi Championship,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/23/thomas-pieters-earns-biggest-career-victory-at-abu-dhabi-championship
1/24/2022,"We are all familiar with elastic bands and other soft, rubbery materials, but familiarity should not diminish our surprise at their properties. What other solids can be stretched many times their original length without breaking, then returned perfectly to their original shape? The theoretical physicist Mark Warner, who has died aged 69 of cancer, not only explained the behaviour of existing soft materials but also predicted the existence and properties of entirely new classes of them – not just once but several times. He imagined the consequences of combining the long, chainlike molecules that make up “elastomers”, such as rubber, with the smaller, rodlike molecules that are found in all liquid-crystal displays, for example on smartphones.  By intuitive reasoning and theoretical calculation he realised that when flexible chains and rods are linked (rather like a multi-pendant necklace) they form materials with entirely new emergent properties, that defy simple classification into one of the traditional states of matter. Though solid overall, these “liquid crystal elastomers” show extreme softness in specific, liquid-like directions. His subsequent calculations predicted that by incorporating certain dye molecules, they could be made to completely change shape in response to weak stimuli, including visible light. This has opened a new technology for creating optically actuated switches and artificial muscles. Exploiting mathematics that Einstein had used to describe the curvature of spacetime owing to gravity, Mark calculated that pliable sheets of these new materials could be designed with an imprinted molecular patterning that would cause them to form complex shapes, otherwise impossible to manufacture. Spontaneous folding into these shapes could be triggered by small changes in lighting or temperature – “The material is the machine” became his mantra. He also showed how inclusion of molecules with chirality, or “handedness”, enables the design of mechanically tuneable rubber lasers, and of membranes that could separate otherwise identical molecules of opposite handedness. This problem of chiral selectivity goes back to the work of Louis Pasteur and remains crucial in the pharmaceuticals industry. Each of the astute and imaginative theoretical foresights that Mark arrived at in Cambridge were later confirmed experimentally, through collaborations elsewhere in the UK and Germany, especially with Heino Finkelmann of the University of Freiburg; these opened up new scientific and technological avenues. Mark’s book, Liquid Crystal Elastomers, co-authored with his longstanding collaborator and colleague Eugene Terentjev, became the standard research text in the field. This work was recognised by Mark’s election to the Royal Society in 2012, and the award of the Humboldt prize in 2000 and the Europhysics prize in 2003 (both with Finkelmann). Alongside his work on elastomers, Mark made important contributions to many other areas of science, including neutron scattering and the mechanics of foams. Much of his groundbreaking research was shared with early-career scientists; Mark’s supervision of his many graduate students and postdoctoral researchers was an unflagging model of generous and selfless mentoring. He was equally determined about physics education, and a founding director of the Senior Physics Challenge, a national project that provides intensive theory and laboratory classes at Cambridge to gifted school students. That experience led Mark to a much larger vision. Believing that UK school pupils lacked opportunities to study physics at a sufficiently quantitative level, preventing many of them from accessing the best that higher education could offer, Mark sought a personal interview with Michael Gove, then education secretary, to explain the problem. A resulting grant from the Department for Education launched Isaac Physics, a nationwide resource of graded physics problems and methods, supported by online tutorials, automatic marking and residential events. More than 200,000 pupils and their teachers in more than 3,000 schools have participated in the scheme, started by Mark and Lisa Jardine-Wright in 2013, and for which in 2019 they were awarded the Institute of Physics’ Lawrence Bragg medal. Born in Wellington, New Zealand, the son of Gunther and Patricia (nee Raven), a secondary and primary schoolteacher, respectively, Mark studied at Auckland grammar school. From there he went to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he gained his first degree in 1974. After a PhD at Imperial College London (1976), under the supervision of Sir Sam Edwards, he worked as an IBM research fellow in San Jose, California, and then at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory near Oxford. In 1986 he returned to Cambridge, initially as a lecturer, and in 2001 was appointed professor. At Corpus Christi he was senior tutor (1992-97) and a life fellow. In 1977 he married Adele Matthaus. While they were on a holiday in a remote part of Greece in the early 1980s his characteristic determination to overcome difficulties came into play when he contracted Guillain-Barré syndrome. He had to drive over rough terrain with his hand strapped to the gear lever so he could operate it, despite encroaching paralysis, before Adele could complete the rest of the route. Mark’s eventual recovery was ascribed by his doctors to his fitness, and a strenuous rehabilitative swimming schedule. He is survived by Adele, their children, Max and Jessica, and a grandson.

1/24/2022,"Nusrat Ghani has been first many times. She was the first Muslim minister to speak from the Commons dispatch box, the first Muslim woman elected as a Tory MP in 2015, the first woman to represent the Conservative stronghold of Wealden, East Sussex and has said she was the first woman in her family to attend university. Born in Kashmir to Pakistani parents, Ghani, 49, grew up in Birmingham before studying at Birmingham City University and Leeds. She worked in an investment bank, charities and the BBC World Service before an unsuccessful attempt at election in 2010 for the seat of Birmingham Ladywood.  Ghani was appointed a member of the home affairs select committee in 2015 and backed Brexit in the EU referendum in 2016. She was promoted to assistant whip and transport minister in 2018 under Theresa May, which the former transport secretary Chris Grayling said at the time showed the Conservatives “were a party of opportunity”. Ghani wrote on her website: “A century after women got the vote for the first time, I hope that today young people can see that regardless of their background, faith, race, gender or sexuality, there will be a warm welcome on the green benches, and no matter where you are from you can achieve your dreams and ambitions.” While a minister, Ghani revealed she had been bombarded with emails from a Conservative activist and constituent praising Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech and questioning whether immigrants should be allowed to stand for parliament. She has also detailed an “incredibly draining” ordeal where she was stalked for two years by a man she said eventually made clear that he had targeted her because she was a female MP, Asian and a Muslim. In February 2020, Ghani was replaced by Kelly Tolhurst in a reshuffle. The Guardian reported that Ghani had been widely tipped for a job overseeing HS2 but was sacked without explanation. A few months later, the former minister said ethnic minorities had “had enough of warm words and zero action” from the government. Following Boris Johnson’s announcement of a commission on racial inequality, Ghani said on Twitter that the prime minister needed to “crack on with real practical solutions”.

1/24/2022,"White applicants to the government’s elite graduate scheme are three times more likely to win a place than their black counterparts, new analysis shows. A record number of graduates applied to join the UK government’s civil service fast stream between 2019 and 2021, with more than 160,800 external applicants for just 3,290 places, a success rate of just under 1 in 50.  However, the figures show that the chances of success differed greatly for separate ethnic backgrounds. Young people from black African or Caribbean backgrounds had a success rate of one in 137 when applying to join the fast stream between 2019 and 2021. In comparison, white applicants had a success rate of one in 44, while Asian applicants had a success rate of one in 77 to join the scheme. Overall, ethnic minority representation improved slightly, from 19% in 2020 to 23% in 2021. Anneliese Dodds, the shadow secretary for women and equalities, described the figures as a “disgrace” and said it showed “just how far ministers are falling short of their promise to make the civil service the UK’s most inclusive employer”. She attacked the “Conservative incompetence and denial of the existence of structural racism” for allowing these disparities to exist. The hugely popular scheme is designed to fast-track successful applicants into senior positions in government. Those who have benefited from it include Sharon White, who was the chief executive of Ofcom and is currently the chair of the John Lewis Partnership. However, the scheme has long been criticised for failing to be inclusive enough. In 2018, figures released by the Cabinet Office showed about a fifth of applicants to the fast stream were from private schools – about three times the proportion who attend such schools in the UK. Dodds, who is also the chair of the Labour party, said: “It’s a disgrace that young people from black backgrounds are still three times less likely than their white counterparts to win a place on the government’s elite graduate scheme. “The fact that you have a 1 in 44 shot at success if you’re white and a 1 in 137 chance if you’re black shows just how far ministers are falling short of their promise to make the civil service the UK’s most inclusive employer. “Conservative incompetence and denial of the existence of structural racism are creating barriers to success for young people from ethnic minority backgrounds. “Labour has a plan to dismantle those barriers and support talented black, Asian and minority ethnic people to reach their full potential, with a new race equality act to tackle structural racial inequality at source.” A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “Our latest data shows that the fast stream is making progress in recruiting the best people from every part of British society. “We know that there is more to do, which is why we have outreach work in the most diverse schools, colleges and universities right across the UK. “We have also expanded our paid diversity internships and continuously review and improve our selection processes.”",News/World news,"White applicants to civil service scheme accepted at far higher rate, figures show",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/23/white-applicants-acceptance-rate-uk-civil-service-scheme
1/24/2022,"When international forces left Afghanistan so abruptly over the summer, we knew the risks of humanitarian catastrophe. Sadly, we are now seeing the consequences. The speed with which humanitarian indicators are plummeting is dramatic, even compared with other serious global crises. The freezing of state assets and the cut in international funding for health and education risk tipping the country into famine: not seen before in Afghanistan’s 40 years of conflict. Economic collapse will cause death and suffering, and increase terrorism and migration. The UK government has announced £286m of humanitarian assistance and supported the UN security council in the careful relaxation of some sanctions. UK citizens have once again responded generously to the Disaster Emergency Committee appeal.  But these measures are not enough to avert an irreversible humanitarian disaster. We believe the UK government needs to act in accordance with two fundamental principles: Afghan lives should not be used for political leverage; and economic and state collapse in Afghanistan is not in our own national interest. So we urge the government to convene an urgent international conference, in partnership with the UN and key international partners. We should do so on the basis that the international community distinguish between two types of aid: money that can be withheld to try to leverage political concessions from the Taliban (such as large scale infrastructure projects – roads, dams and so on); and money to enable government institutions to deliver basic human services and to keep the economy from collapsing. Given the weak economy, Afghans providing essential services have largely been paid from the aid budgets of development partners for the last 20 years. Governments – rightly – do not want to give any succour to the Taliban. Instead, money has been channelled into the humanitarian system. This is important, but cannot replace institutional service delivery to 40 million people. Humanitarian agencies are ready and able to pay medical staff, teachers and other civil servants delivering public services. But they need the money to do so – far more than has yet been delivered. And they need a clear political mandate from donors, not least the US. The UK should therefore press for five practical outcomes: The international community to meet the UN’s appeal for humanitarian funding and accelerate payment of money promised. The preservation of state delivery systems, including salary payments for civil servants delivering essential public services. The resumption of technical support to the central bank to prevent economic collapse and pursue the managed and limited release of the Afghan people’s foreign exchange reserves. The reinstatement of the Afghan reconstruction trust fund, a trusted mechanism for structured and accountable disbursement of international donor development funds. Projects must be scrutinised and adjusted to ensure no direct benefit accrues to the Taliban. The release of some of the frozen Afghan foreign reserves so that salaries of essential workers can be paid directly by third parties and key social services be maintained. All of these are compatible with maintaining a policy of non-recognition of the Taliban regime. The UN secretary general has clearly stated: the time to act is now.

1/24/2022,"Saturday Night Live opens by going back to a (very dry) well with a new edition of Fox News’s Ingraham Angle. Laura Ingraham (Kate McKinnon) celebrates “year one of Biden’s presidency” by listing some of his big failures: rising inflation, high gas prices, the green M&M being “cancelled just for being a whore”. Her guests include Senator Ted Cruz (Aidy Bryant), who reminds all his fellow Texans that “February’s gonna be a cold one, so you might want to book your vacay to Cancun now”; her “one black friend” Candace Owens, there to “continue to fight for African Americans, no matter how many times they ask me to stop”; and finally, former president Donald Trump (James Austin Johnson).  Trump uses Wordle to free associate on random topics, including John Mayer (“I’d rather be mayor of anything than be governor Ron DeSantis – I’d beat him so senseless if he went against me, just like I beat Hillary”), How I Met Your Father (“It doesn’t have the charm and sparkle of, frankly, Mother, but we love Duff”), Lisa Bonet and Jason Momoa (“Momoa is a very big boy … he looks like a sexy devil”), before making a pitch for re-election in 2024. As with every Ingraham sketch, it feels cobbled together at the last minute. Austin’s Trump’s impression remains aces, but he’s given little to work with here. Former cast member Will Forte returns after 12 years away to host for the first time. Forte passive-aggressively celebrates his former alumni – Kristen Wiig, Jason Sudeikis, Andy Samberg, Fred Armisen, Seth Meyers and John Mulaney – all hosting before him, claiming they “saved the best for waaaay last”. His spotlight is quickly stolen by his MacGruber co-star Wiig, who shows up to support him, only to be quickly dismissed. Forte attempts to give a heartfelt speech about how much the show has meant to him, but he’s cut off by Lorne Michaels, who informs him that there was a mix-up and the night’s host was supposed to be Willem Dafoe (Dafoe, who pops up for a silent cameo, will actually be hosting next week). Given that it’s the only SNL character of the last 21 years to make the jump to the big screen (and now streaming), it was a foregone conclusion we’d get some new MacGruber adventures, and the show wastes no time getting to them. The mulleted gadget master and man-of-action has to dismantle a bomb in a “small room with limited airflow” before it explodes and kills himself and his partners (series co-stars Wiig and Ryan Phillippe). However, the Covid-pandemic has thrown a monkey wrench into things, and he lets his anti-mask, anti-vax stance (“I don’t want the government putting a tracking device up my scrotum!”) distract him, leading to the inevitable explosion. Next, Forte plays Mark Zazz, the host of Kid Klash, a Nickelodeon-style game show where kids compete in messy challenges for the chance to win pizza for life (“You get to keep this one pizza for your entire life”). Contestant Tatum (Bryant) is tasked with finding a flag in a giant bowl of whipped cream. She’s unable to complete the challenge, but Zazz forces her to stay in and finish, using the game to cruelly impart a harsh life lesson: “I didn’t start this game show to encourage children to quit like whiney little babies!” Forte’s hilariously menacing vibe and the impressive prop work combine to make one of the best sketches of the season We then immediately return to the adventure of the new, alt-right MacGruber, who tries to reassure his teammates that he’s following the science and safety protocols for Covid, before immediately ingesting Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine to treat his “Covidifillis”– a combination of Covid, syphilis, free-standing herpes and horse worms. After eating some horse-worm infested spaghetti he’s kept hidden in his underpants, he attempts to spout some QAnon nonsense, but is interrupted by another detonation. On a new episode of Cinema Classics, host and perpetually miserable husband Reese De-What (Kenan Thompson) introduces the classic 1944 noir Gaslight, starring Ingrid Bergman (McKinnon) as a woman being driven insane by her evil husband, played by Charles Boyer (Forte), and her maid, played by a young Angela Lansbury (Chloe Fineman). Cinema Classics is always good for a few laughs – De’What may be the most reliably funny recurring character in the show’s repertoire at the moment – but this one is disappointingly slight. A planned threesome between a married couple (Mikey Day, Fineman) and “experienced third” Gannon – a platinum blonde, goateed Forte – immediately goes off the rails when Gannon makes it clear that he intends to cut the husband out of the action (“This dog gets greedy with his treats!”). Forte makes for a perfect sleazebag, but as with the previous sketch, things wraps up before it really gets going. On Weekend Update, Michael Che welcomes back Chinese trade minister/Olympic games organizer Chen Biao (Bowen Yang). Biao could care less about NBC’s decision to cover the games remotely, as well as diplomatic boycotts over China’s human rights violations: “It’s our party and we’ll spy if we want to.” Biao is followed by Sarah Sherman. Ostensibly there to talk about her favorite season, winter, she spends all her time trying to cancel Colin Jost, turning his innocuous comments into scandalized headlines such “Local Female Body Inspector Colin Jost Prefers Hairless Genitals”, “Wealth -Hoarding Hollywood Husband Colin Jost-Hansson Has Not a Dime to Spare”, and “Local Sex Bigot Rejects Queer Love”. Che and Sherman’s big, intentionally abrasive personalities have proven divisive amongst viewers, but they both bring an undeniably palpable energy to Update. They’re followed by the smarmy Guy Who Just Bought a Boat (Alex Moffat), who congratulates “bro-bro from a ‘no ho” Jost, along with Pete Davidson, on their recent real-life purchase of a retired Staten Island ferryboat. Davidson joins the proceedings, but it’s Moffatt’s show all the way. He makes Davidson and Jost break continuously. Then Forte and Wiig return to play washed-up country stars who sing bizarre and disturbing tunes about “the four things they know best: spaceships, toddlers, model-T cars and jars of beer”. It’s a Forte specialty: a late-in-the-night, go-for-broke blast of weirdness (see also: the classic potato chip sketch from 2009). Then we’re treated to one final MacGruber sketch. Despite an intervention from friends and family, MacGruber has only fallen further into the rightwing rabbit hole. Dressed like the QAnon Shaman from the Capitol Insurrection, he rants about baby-eating Hollywood elites, ignoring another ticking time bomb until it’s too late. There was never any doubt that Forte would nail his hosting duties, but luckily, the show let him get as weird as he wanted for most of the episode. Much of it played like a long advertisement for Peacock’s MacGruber series, but that’s not hardly something to complain about. Along with Sudeikis’s episode from October, this is the best SNL has been all season. It’s only too bad every episode can’t be handed over to a cast member from that era of the show.",Arts/Television & radio,Saturday Night Live: Will Forte returns for a weird and wonderful season high,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/jan/23/saturday-night-live-will-forte-kristen-wiig
1/24/2022,"Four-and-a-half decades into a constantly evolving career, Elvis Costello seems to have come full circle. After the lavish reissue of 1979’s Armed Forces in 2020, and last summer’s reappraisal of This Year’s Model with Spanish-language guest singers, The Boy Named If also locates itself very firmly in Costello’s late-70s/early-80s purple patch. There’s a real punch to most of the 13 songs here, the Imposters rocking hard and rolling back the years to infuse the taut arrangements with real urgency. Winning melodies abound, particularly on Mistook Me for a Friend and the title track, about an imaginary friend who can be blamed for all of one’s misdeeds. As ever with Costello, there is a richness to the lyrics, and as on 2018’s Look Now, his protagonists are on occasion female: the pretty tune of The Difference conceals a kernel of darkness, with an abused daughter committing patricide.  Equally thought-provoking is Paint the Red Rose Blue, which details the death of a relationship (this time from a male perspective). Even when the tempo drops, the quality doesn’t, the rich imagery of Trick Out the Truth being a case in point. Effortlessly classy.",Arts/Music,Elvis Costello and the Imposters: The Boy Named If review – the glory days recaptured,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/jan/23/elvis-costello-and-the-imposters-the-boy-named-if-review-glory-days-recaptured
1/24/2022,"Comoros will be forced to start an outfield player in net for their Africa Cup of Nations round of 16 clash against hosts Cameroon on Monday, as their three goalkeepers are all absent. First choice Salim Ben Boina is missing through injury after being stretchered off in their win over Ghana, while his understudies, Moyadh Ousseini and Ali Ahamada, have tested positive for Covid.  It is a huge blow for the team as their build up to arguably the biggest match in their history. They have a total of seven players absent due to Covid, severely depleting their ranks. An unnamed outfield player has been training as a goalkeeper in recent days to prepare him to face the tournaments top scorers, who scored seven goals in their three group matches. The Comoros assistant manager Daniel Padovanni said: “We’ve already chosen an outfield player who will start as keeper. It’s a player who in training has shown that he can play as a keeper.” ",Sport/Football,‘He can play as a keeper’: Comoros to use outfield player in net in Afcon last-16 tie,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/23/comoros-to-use-outfield-player-in-net-goalkeeper-africa-cup-of-nations
1/24/2022,"Despite hitting the headlines in recent weeks, when Mark Spencer was appointed as Boris Johnson’s chief whip in 2019 he was described as a relative unknown outside Westminster. The website ConservativeHome said he had “contrived to remain one of the least-known major players” in SW1. The exception may have been in his constituency of Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, where his family have lived for four generations. Before his election as an MP in 2010, Spencer joined the family farm business after qualifying at Shuttleworth Agricultural College in Bedfordshire.  Spencer, who celebrated his 52nd birthday last week, is married with two children and attended local comprehensive schools in the village of Calverton. A member of various select committees, he was appointed as parliamentary private secretary to Liz Truss when she was secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, before joining the whips’ office. In 2015 Spencer was accused by the Spectator of “rigid tribalism” after appearing to defend a benefits system that sanctioned a jobseeker with learning disabilities because he was four minutes late for a jobcentre appointment. In January 2016 he was one of 72 MPs who were themselves landlords who voted against proposed new rules explicitly requiring rental properties to be “fit for human habitation”. Despite supporting the remain campaign in the EU referendum, Spencer’s promotion to chief whip – a role he described at the time to Farmers Weekly as the “grease that makes parliament work” – was met with broad approval from different wings of the parliamentary party. Heralding his appointment, the former Tory MP Nick Boles said Spencer was “one of the nicest people in the Conservative parliamentary party … firm, fair, with his feet planted firmly on the ground.” He also said Spencer “makes great pies”, in reference to his family’s farm shop, which boasts of selling three kinds of pork pies – a culinary reference more recently seen as a byword for alleged plots against Spencer’s boss.",News/Politics,Who is the government chief whip Mark Spencer? ,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/23/chief-whip-mark-spencer
1/24/2022,"A group of survivors and relatives of people who died in the infected blood scandal are suing a school where they contracted hepatitis and HIV after being given experimental treatment without informed consent. A proposed group action lodged by Collins Solicitors in the high court on Friday alleges that Treloar College, a boarding school in Hampshire that specialised in teaching haemophiliacs, failed in its duty of care to these pupils in the 1970s and 80s.  The claim could result in a payout running into millions of pounds, and is based on new testimony given by former staff at the school to the ongoing infected blood inquiry. Gary Webster, 56, a former pupil who was infected with hepatitis C and HIV after being treated with contaminated blood at the school in the early 80s and gave evidence to the inquiry last year, is the lead claimant of the 22 survivors in the group. Speaking to the Guardian, he said: “We were lab rats or guinea pigs. We always thought that we may have been experimented on for research purposes, but we had no proof until the evidence given in the inquiry.” Last year in testimony to the inquiry, the former headteacher of Treloars, Alec Macpherson, confirmed that doctors at the school were “experimenting with the use of factor VIII”, an imported pooled plasma that was later discovered to be contaminated with HIV and hepatitis. He said he and other teaching staff did not question doctors about the trials. He told the inquiry: “We didn’t have any authority or reason to interfere. You can’t – doctors are god, aren’t they?” Macpherson said he consented to the treatment because he trusted the doctors, and he could not recall if parents were informed and consulted. Webster said: “None of our parents were ever informed. I’m damn sure my mother and father would have asked why my treatment was changing, and by 1983 they would have known there were problems with imported factor VIII.” He added: “I am really angry, especially after hearing evidence from the school. It should never have happened. The staff had a duty of care and I think they were negligent.” Webster was 18 in 1983 when he was told by school doctors he been infected with HIV – and was given two years to live. He said: “I was with my best friend, Stephen, who died of Aids in 1990, and we told just told by doctors at the school that we were infected and we would probably be dead in two years.” Two years later Webster was told he also had hepatitis C as a result of the infected blood given to him to at the school. He said: “I had full-blown Aids in my late 20s early 30s. It was only because of the treatment that came out that I managed to pull through. Many others didn’t.” The public inquiry heard last year that of 89 haemophiliac children who attended Treloar in the 70s and 80s, less than a quarter were still alive. Webster said the survivors had been left psychologically scarred and received no counselling at the time. “We are all damaged mentally as well as physically. I went off the rails and started drinking a lot. I stuck a car through a wall once trying to kill myself. A lot of us had suicidal thoughts with the stigma of Aids and the news that you weren’t going to live long anyway, and relationships were a nightmare.” Despite his problems, Webster said he had been one of the lucky ones, because he survived and managed to work, first as tailor and then as a manager for Red Cross before he was forced to retire on health grounds at the age of 46. “It is the hep C that has really done me damage, my liver is absolutely shot, and I physically can’t work any more,” he said. Desmond Collins, a senior partner at Collins Solicitors, said: “This is a straightforward breach of duty case. The school was acting in loco parentis, yet failed in its basic duty of care to these already vulnerable boys. We are determined that they receive recognition and due recompense for the trauma that and their families have suffered over decades.” He added: “There was a fatal lack of curiosity from the school about what was going on. The boys were treated as a dataset which medics decided to experiment on. The parents were entitled to an explanation of what was going on. The school didn’t tell them anything because they didn’t know anything – it just handed it all over the medics.” In a statement, the college – which has since changed its name to Treloar’s – said: “We are truly saddened that about 100 of our former pupils are amongst the 4,500 men, women and children across the UK who were infected with hepatitis and/or HIV from infected blood products supplied within the NHS treatment programme. “We are unable to comment on the legal action taken against Treloar’s at this point, but we will continue to cooperate with the public inquiry into these issues and await its outcome.”",News/UK news,Infected blood scandal: ex-pupils and relatives sue Hampshire school ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/23/infected-blood-scandal-ex-pupils-and-relatives-sue-hampshire-school
