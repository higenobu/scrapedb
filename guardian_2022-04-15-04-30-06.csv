4/15/2022,"Canada was warned in 2012 by its own scientists that a virus was infecting both farmed and wild salmon, but successive governments ignored the expert advice, saying for years that risks to salmon were low. Justin Trudeau’s government has said it will phase out open-pen industrial fish farms off the coast of British Columbia by 2025. But both his government and the previous Conservative government were in possession of a newly released report that linked large-scale farms and wild salmon to the highly contagious Piscine orthoreovirus (PRV). In 2012, biologists with the department of fisheries and oceans investigated the presence of the virus, which has been found in both farmed and wild salmon. In March, a federal information commissioner ordered the report be released, after a multi-year access-to-information battle between the group Wild First, which opposes open-pen salmon farms, and the federal government. Details of the report were made public on Thursday by the Globe and Mail. Kristi Miller-Saunders, a federal biologist and an author on the study, called the delay in releasing the report a “travesty” and said its omission has contributed to longstanding doubt over whether farmed salmon were infecting wild salmon. PRV causes anemia and jaundice in farmed salmon. But in wild Chinook, whose numbers have collapsed in recent years, the virus is associated with a different disease which causes blood cells to rupture, leading to kidney and liver damage. Miller-Saunders said in a statement her research was the first to discover the virus in North America and that the virus was “being actively transmitted between farmed and wild salmon in B.C.” A study last year from the University of British Columbia confirmed her work, concluding that the closer wild Chinook are to fish farms, the higher the likelihood they’ll be infected by the Piscine orthoreovirus. The decade-old findings take on a new urgency as both the federal government and officials in British Columbia grapple with a decimation of wild Pacific salmon stocks in the region, which experts fear could have far-reaching ecological consequences. In addition to PRV, biologists have also argued that sea lice and mouth rot, which can be fatal in salmon, is also being transferred from farmed to wild salmon. Alexandra Morton, an independent biologist who has studied Pacific salmon for the last thirty years, has long argued that open-pen farms are responsible for the presence of the multiple illnesses plaguing wild salmon and alleges the country’s fisheries ministry too often sides with corporate interests. “There are scientists that genuinely care about investigating these issues. And there is the middle level of the department that is suppressing people like Dr. Miller. They’re ignoring all of the outside research,” Morton told the Guardian last year amid frustration that critical research findings were being withheld. Trudeau’s government has pledged to phase out open-pen salmon farms by 2025– a move fiercely opposed by operators. Industry has has warned the closures will result in millions of farm salmon being prematurely killed as well as the loss of hundreds of jobs and are fighting the orders in court. “Industry should have known this was coming and seen the writing on the walls. They should have started transitioning to different kinds of enclosures. Instead, they relied for years on the government– on the department of fisheries and oceans–to hide their sins,” said Morton. The BC Salmon Farmers Association said in a statement it would rather see peer-reviewed information about industry rather than “ad-hoc” releases through Canada’s access to information laws.",News/Environment,Canada ignored warnings of virus infecting farmed and wild salmon,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/14/infected-farmed-wild-salmon-canada-virus-report
4/15/2022,"A wind-driven fire burning across New Mexico is believed to have killed two people, after the remains of a couple were found near their charred home. Police investigators and firefighters found the older couple’s remains on Wednesday afternoon after family members notified police that the two had tried to evacuate but were unaccounted for. The wildfire has prompted eviction orders for as many as 4,500 people, and destroyed more than 200 residences on the edge of a mountain community in the southern part of the state. Kerry Gladden, a spokesperson for the Ruidoso police, said that fire crews are hoping to take advantage of a break in the relentless winds to make headway against the deadly blaze. The couple’s remains were found near the house but not in it, and no additional information was immediately available, Gladden said. Authorities were working to confirm the identities of the two people. The fire moved into a more densely populated area on Ruidoso’s north-eastern side on Wednesday afternoon, prompting more evacuations. Laura Rabon, a spokesperson for the Lincoln national forest, interrupted a fire briefing and told people to get in their cars and leave after the flames jumped a road where crews were trying to hold the line. Overnight, crews kept the flames from pushing further into the village, Rabon said. The fire has torched about 9 sq miles (23 sq km) of forest and grass, and the strong winds that battered the area have left behind toppled trees and downed power lines. Crews continued to work on Thursday to restore power to parts of the village that have been without it since Monday. While the cause of the blaze was under investigation, fire officials and forecasters warned that persistent dry and windy conditions had prompted another day of red flag warnings for the eastern third of New Mexico and other parts of the southwest. Incident commander Dave Bales said the strategy was “attack while we can”, noting that winds were expected to pick up Thursday afternoon and again Friday. “We’re trying to keep this fire as small as possible, especially because it’s right in the community,” he said. “We’ve had a loss of a lot of structures so our crews are right there on the fire front going as direct as possible.” Six new large fires were reported Wednesday: three in Texas, two in Colorado and one in Oklahoma. In all, wildland firefighters and support personnel were trying to contain 11 large fires that have charred more than 40 square miles (103 square kilometers) in five states. The National Interagency Fire Center reported Thursday that since the start of the year, 18,550 wildfires have burned about 1,250 sq miles. That’s well above the 10-year average of 12,290 wildfires and 835 sq miles burned. Hotter and drier weather coupled with decades of fire suppression have contributed to an increase in the number of acres burned by wildfires, fire scientists say. The problem is exacerbated by a more than 20-year western megadrought that studies link to human-caused climate change. Elsewhere in New Mexico, wildfires were burning northwest of Ruidoso, along the Rio Grande south of Albuquerque, in mountains northwest of the community of Las Vegas and in grasslands along the Pecos River near the town of Roswell.",News/US news,Couple found dead in wind-driven fire burning across New Mexico,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/apr/14/new-mexico-wildfire-couple-dead
4/15/2022,"The eulogizing began as soon as the Kardashian-Jenner family announced the end of their flagship reality show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians (KUWTK), after 14 years in 2020. Or, more accurately, the memorializing — the attempts to take stock of the field-warping influence that America’s unofficial royal family had on the laws of celebrity, beauty, fashion, and self-monetization in the 2010s. The original show was the Kardashians’ rocket to an unfathomable stratosphere of wealth, fame and influence, the vehicle through which a wealthy but strident Hollywood-adjacent clan once best known for their late father and a sex tape self-promoted and content-generated their way to the epitome of the social media celebrity order. By the time it ended in spring of last year, the family had seemingly outgrown the reality TV format they had basically created in their image. Why bother face-tuning six-month-old drama for TV when you can push the narrative immediately on your phone? Were there any rungs on the fame ladder left to climb? Apparently, yes. Of course the “for better or for worse” paeans to KUWTK’s end have become accessories to the start of something new: The Kardashians, the family’s new reality show on Hulu, born from a deal worth an estimated $100m. (The family now means: Kris, Kourtney, Kim and Khloé Kardashian, and Kendall and Kylie Jenner, as well as their numerous children and current or ex romantic partners. Rob Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner are not involved.) The latest cog in the Kardashian-Jenner mega-corporation is a sleeker, cannier version of the original rooted in the same propagandistic DNA though, in the only two 45-minute episodes made available to critics, said narrative spinning seems half-heartedly applied. It’s easy to consume the show but difficult to process The Kardashians. The new show is relatively trivial – Kourtney’s ex Scott Disick stressed about not getting invited to a barbecue, Kim stressed about hosting SNL last October, Khloé stressed about appearing on James Corden, I stressed about their Instagram faces and cyborg bodies in motion. But the family, especially Kim, is at this point something like a cultural hyperobject — an idea too big, suffusive and multifaceted to fully comprehend or describe. Since KUTWK premiered in 2007, the Kardashians have become the avatars and drivers of American culture on innumerable fronts, among them: impossible beauty standards, the aesthetic of an entire dominant platform (Instagram), the democratized accessibility of fame, image manipulation (how many times have they denied blatant photo-shopping and cosmetic alterations?), the unreality of reality TV, the relentless drive to turn everything into profit, the currency of undefeated shamelessness. The family – again, Kim especially – has made their name on their queasy proximity to and appropriation of blackness. As White Negroes author Lauren Michele Jackson argued, Kim, an Armenian-American, has a singular talent for metachrosis – the ability to change color. She occupies a “cherished place in the American racial imagination that, combined with wealth, prevents contact with the deathly effects (and melancholic affects) of brownness in this country while reaping the exoticism of not-quite whiteness.” All of this buoys and buffets the show, which in and of itself is as bland as their monochrome ath-leisure suits and glossy nude lips. The Kardashians, executive produced by Ben Winston (who also EPs The Late Late Show with James Corden – note the episode 2 crossover), opens as if on a hang-glider. The camera zooms around their colossal, vacuous homes in birth order, except for the conclusion: Kim, arguably the reason they ever got a reality show in the first place, the Kardashian with access to the highest echelons of celebrity, and not so subtly the new show’s lodestar. KUWTK was always an expression of shrewd, uncanny, often tasteless manufacturing, and it continues to be here. The storylines are already public knowledge, and filtered here for barely titillating, but not overly revealing, effect. Kourtney is in love with Travis Barker and trying for a fourth child. Kim is prepping for SNL and, she proudly notes, studying for the California “baby bar” exam. Khloé is still friends with Scott, who is still not over Kourtney, and still defending ex Tristan Thompson. Consummate mom-ager Kris keeps showing up to check on things. (Kendall and Kylie are almost entirely absent.) There are a lot of skintight bodysuits and large dark sunglasses. The show was never “good,” in a moral sense, nor was it seamless, but it’s always a very rich text. There are few things more representative of American capitalism and culture than an already rich family who hustled their proximity to fame into a self-generating content well of living advertisements. (I can’t keep track of the numerous brands and dubious businesses, but safe to say they’re in every scene of the new show.) The Kardashians are the proto-influencers, blurring the lines of personal and professional in the name of promotion and profit. The fakeness of the reality show – and it’s a shrug to note the on-screen conversations here are clearly nipped and tucked for television – has always been beside the point. Kardashian TV is more like improv – attuned and curated versions of themselves, from people so used to being on camera they muse about repeatedly while on new cameras. The richest part of the new Hulu show is witnessing snippets of their now gravitational celebrity orbit, however mediated – the familiarity with which famous performers from James Corden to Amy Schumer enter and exit the screen. Schumer advises Kim on her SNL monologue with actual pushback to her jokes (one that is sharper than you’d expect.) There’s something interesting, in a work-porn adjacent way, in watching Kim name-drop “Dave” (Chappelle) for monologue advice or request SNL booker (and Ben Affleck ex) Lindsey Shookus for last-minute line changes to spare the unstable Kanye. Interesting and somewhat revulsive, too, to see James Corden hype-man advise Khloé to ignore social media – this, for a woman who has gaslit followers on her manipulated body and images and participated in her own fair share of online bullying. These asides stick the most because they hint both at the celebrity ecosystems whose rupture the Kardashians rode and remade, and the casualness with which the ultra-famous go about their well-oiled days. Nothing has changed and yet everything is different now, elevated. The Kardashians have stuck together. Though the new show feels, in structure and six-month-old content, like a recent relic, no doubt people will be watching.

4/15/2022,"Asylum seekers flown to Rwanda by the British government will be put up in a no-frills hostel a mile away from Kigali city centre. People fleeing war and persecution will be taken to a guest house, built in 2014, which only has 50 rooms available, although there are plans to expand the facility. Hope guest house, a privately owned hostel in the Gasabo district of the capital, is currently being used for tourist accommodation, according to Rwandan government officials. However, it is understood that Rwandan authorities are in negotiation to lease the basic and stripped-back property to be used to house UK asylum seekers while their claims are being processed. However, given Britain’s growing asylum backlog, a hostel that can only accommodate 100 people – if there are two people to a room and guests share communal bathrooms – falls well short of what is required as part of the Home Office’s immigration strategy. There are just 12 toilets and five showers for about 100 people and small 12ft by 12ft (3.6 x 3.6-metre) bedrooms, with two beds in each. There are plans to expand the facility by building more accommodation blocks, eventually offering 150 rooms and able to sleep up to 300 people, but the government has not said how long this will take. Asylum seekers are expected to be given three meals a day to eat in a communal dining room, with some kitchen facilities also available for those with special dietary requirements. The plans, announced by Boris Johnson at a time when his premiership hangs by a thread following his Partygate fixed-penalty notice, have been criticised across the political spectrum. The Tory peer Lady Warsi wrote on Twitter on Thursday that they were “ineffective and costly”, adding: “It’s also inhumane and shames our proud history as advocates of human rights and the refugee convention. “It’s inconsistent with our generous response to the Ukrainian crisis. Its timing is cynical and political.” Meanwhile, Priti Patel made a private visit to the site on Thursday to see an example of what accommodation may be on offer. It was understood to be the home secretary’s first visit to Rwanda since the deal was agreed, after being briefed by Home Office and Foreign Office officials who have been researching the plan. The PA Media news agency contributed to this report.",News/UK news,UK asylum seekers to be housed in no-frills hostel in Rwandan capital,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/uk-asylum-seekers-to-be-housed-in-no-frills-hostel-in-rwandan-capital
4/15/2022,"Boris Johnson’s plans to send unauthorised asylum seekers on a one-way ticket to Rwanda have been roundly condemned amid warnings that it will be challenged in the courts and could result in further deaths in the Channel. After the prime minister outlined plans to hand an initial down-payment of £120m to the Rwandan government in the hope that it will accept “tens of thousands” of people, politicians and refugee groups condemned the move as inhumane, unworkable and a waste of public money. The Rwanda proposal was one of a series of measures announced by the prime minister and Priti Patel, the home secretary, as they seek to get to grips with a febrile political row over Channel crossings. The number of people crossing has already passed 5,000 this year, more than double the 2021 total at the same point. Amid calls for the government to disclose the overall costs of the plans, which have not been released, it emerged that:  Men and women could be flown 4,500 miles to Rwanda, where they will be encouraged to apply for refugee status. However, children and their parents would not be sent.  The Royal Navy has been given powers to control the Channel after another day of hundreds of people arriving in small boats to seek refuge in the UK.  Tobias Ellwood, the Conservative chair of the defence select committee, accused Johnson of unveiling the plans as part of a “massive distraction” from becoming the first prime minister to be found guilty of a criminal charge while in office.  A Border Force union official has warned that the announcement will result in a short-term spike in refugees trying to cross the Channel, with an elevated risk of travelling in poor conditions, putting lives at risk.  A snap poll by YouGov of almost 3,000 voters on Thursday found that only 35% of people support the measures, with 43% opposed. Speaking at a press conference in Kent, Johnson said the scheme was needed to “save countless lives” from human trafficking by breaking the business model of people smugglers. “The deal we have done [with Rwanda] is uncapped, and Rwanda will have the capacity to resettle tens of thousands of people in the years ahead. And let’s be clear, Rwanda is one of the safest countries in the world, globally recognised for its record of welcoming and integrating migrants,” he said. Asked about the poor human rights record in Rwanda, where some groups have logged the torture of detainees, he said: “Rwanda has totally transformed. Over the last few decades it has totally transformed from what it was.” Refusing to engage with questions about his breaking of lockdown rules, Johnson said the Royal Navy would from Thursday take over “operational command” in the Channel from the Border Force to ensure “no boat makes it to the UK undetected”. Measures will be introduced to intercept more small boats and the navy will be given “primacy” to track and intercept them – with £50m of new funding to pay for Wildcat helicopters, search and rescue aircraft, and drones. Under the plans, those sent to Rwanda will be offered asylum there, with claims processed within three months. Those who are successful will be able to stay for at least five years with a training and support package. As Johnson addressed reporters, new arrivals reached the shore in Dover on what officials acknowledged was a busy day for crossings. In a visit to the Rwandan capital, Kigali, Patel was shown pristine accommodation that will be used to house people flown from the UK. The guest house has 50 rooms over four floors that can accommodate a maximum of 100 people. Two more blocks will be built that will provide a maximum capacity of 300. In a press conference with Rwanda’s foreign minister, Vincent Biruta, Patel said on Thursday: “Our world-leading migration and economic development partnership is a global first and will change the way we collectively tackle illegal migration through new, innovative and world-leading solutions.” However, the Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi called the scheme inhumane and cynical. “This proposal of offshoring asylum seekers to Rwanda is ineffective and costly,” she said. “It’s also inhumane and shames our proud history as advocates of human rights and the refugee convention. She said the plan was inconsistent with the UK’s “generous response” to the Ukraine crisis and described the timing of it as cynical and political. The British Red Cross executive director, Zoe Abrams, said the humanitarian network was “profoundly concerned” about the plans to “send traumatised people halfway round the world to Rwanda”. “We are not convinced this drastic measure will deter desperate people from attempting to cross the Channel either. People come here for reasons we can all understand, like wanting to be reunited with loved ones, or because they speak the language. Making it harsher may do little to stop them risking their lives,” she said. Lucy Moreton, the professional officer of the ISU immigration and border union, warned that the announcement could lead to further loss of life in the Channel as people become desperate to reach the UK before any plans to send them Rwanda are implemented. She said: “What has been announced today is likely to push the immediate numbers up. And that will mean people crossing in less than ideal conditions, putting lives at risk. “We are worried that they will simply panic and hurt themselves, or inadvertently hurt us, or deliberately hurt us to stay in the UK to be prosecuted rather than be sent to Rwanda. This is not going to happen quickly, possibly for months, and you are frightening everybody until then.” The president of the Law Society of England and Wales, I. Stephanie Boyce, said there were serious questions over whether the plans complied with international law. “The government is announcing this scheme before parliament has approved the necessary powers,” she said. “There are serious questions about whether these plans would or could comply with the UK’s promises under international treaty.”",News/UK news,"UK Rwanda plan for asylum seekers decried as inhumane, deadly and expensive",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/14/uk-rwanda-plan-for-asylum-seekers-decried-as-inhumane-deadly-and-expensive
4/15/2022,"Leicester City supporters spent the afternoon mingling with the club’s top brass, the chairman Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha among those taking in the atmosphere in Markt Eindhoven, one of the city’s main squares, and there promises to be a reasonable after-party after watching their team come from behind to complete a late comeback and reach a first European semi-final. James Maddison’s equaliser fuelled Leicester’s belief and Ricardo Pereira prodded in at the back post after the substitute Patson Daka, who earlier spurned a golden chance to level, was denied. Leicester will face either Roma or Bodø/Glimt in the Europa Conference League last four. Maddison had displayed a determination to take this game by the scruff of the neck, his appetite clear when he wriggled between Érick Gutiérrez and André Ramalho to carve an opening, and it was no surprise that he sourced Leicester a lifeline on which to build after they fell behind to Eran Zahavi’s first-half strike. A PSV supporter threw his beer towards Maddison as the midfielder was mobbed by his teammates and Brendan Rodgers was all smiles when Pereira sealed victory with two minutes to spare. It was a no-frills finish but a well-worked move, the impressive Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall releasing Ademola Lookman, who picked out Daka inside the box. The gnawing thing for Rodgers is that his side spurned two wonderful openings to ease such drama, before PSV struck on 27 minutes and a chance to level midway through the second half when Daka fired wide. For the first, Kelechi Iheanacho played a superb reverse pass from inside his own half to free Harvey Barnes but the winger, seemingly blinkered, ignored the unmarked Maddison to his right and placed his shot wide. Rodgers dragged his fingers down his face and Maddison was equally unimpressed. PSV would have taken the lead earlier had Kasper Schmeichel not got a strong right hand to a thunderous Mario Götze volley. Schmeichel made a smart save at his near post to deny Joey Veerman two minutes before PSV struck through Zahavi. Götze seized Youri Tielemans’ loose pass and slipped in Zahavi, whose finish into the far pocket of the Leicester goal from an awkward angle was akin to a snooker pot. That goal inevitably stirred the home crowd but Leicester continued to create chances, with Maddison twice going close. His deflected shot was hooked off the line by Jordan Teze and he flashed over from inside the box after cutting inside Gutiérrez approaching the interval after Timothy Castagne headed wide at the back post after meeting Tielemans’s scooped cross. Rodgers made a double change at half-time, Lookman and Daka replacing Barnes and Marc Albrighton. Leicester presented the PSV captain Cody Gakpo with an opening shortly after the interval when Tielemans’ pass was intercepted on halfway but Schmeichel saved comfortably. Veerman then drilled a shot wide via an outstretched Wesley Fofana boot to leave Schmeichel asking questions of his defence. If Barnes’s early chance was big, Daka’s was massive. Iheanacho hooked a clever ball over the top of the PSV defence and Daka raced through one on one with the goalkeeper Yvon Mvogo but the striker, perhaps put off by Teze’s determination to make life difficult, dropped his shot wide. A minute later Maddison curled a shot wide that Mvogo clambered low to tip round a post but his desire to make the difference did not end there, converting the substitute Ayoze Pérez’s pullback before Pereira capped the comeback.",Sport/Football,Leicester book historic semi-final spot as late fightback floors PSV Eindhoven,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/14/psv-eindhoven-leicester-europa-conference-league-quarter-final-second-leg-match-report

Anne was born in Salford, Greater Manchester, into a family like no other. Her parents, Pat (Patricia, nee Knight), a homemaker, and George Dale, who worked for the charity Community Transport in Salford, had 12 children through birth and adoption. In addition, they fostered dozens more, both short-term and long-term, and all were treated as their own. In this way, Anne had more than 60 brothers and sisters. She grew up in a home full of love with never a dull moment. It gave her an immense capacity for kindness. Anne attended Cathedral high school in Salford, then went to sixth form at De La Salle College, where she met Terry Aspray in a production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s Iolanthe. They married in 1987. Anne studied medicine at Leeds Medical School, qualifying in 1987, and trained in paediatrics at hospitals in and around Newcastle. After they both qualified as doctors, she and Terry went to the Gambia, where from 1991 to 1993 she was the first woman to head the Medical Research Council’s Dunn human nutrition unit. As well as running the field station with more than 100 staff, she completed a research project on helicobacter pylori infection in Gambian children, part of her doctoral thesis for Newcastle University, which she completed in 2001. From 1994 onwards, she worked at the Royal Victoria infirmary in Newcastle, and Newcastle General hospital and Queen Elizabeth hospital in Gateshead, becoming a consultant paediatrician at the last of these in 2001. She was known for her fantastic medical knowledge and her endless kindness. Anne was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2020. She continued to be as active as she could for as long as possible, leaving work in summer 2021. Outside her work, Anne loved music and was dedicated to worthwhile causes. After leaving her job she continued to be an active campaigner online – including for Extinction Rebellion and No to Hassockfield. She was a trustee for the Children’s Foundation and was the driving force behind its baby box initiative, to give every child born in the north-east the essentials for a good to start in life. She also supported Medical Aid for Palestinians, Médecins Sans Frontières and Freedom from Torture. Her energy for doing good was limitless and her bonds with her family were close, especially with her mother, Pat, who survived her by a month, but also with her in-laws.

She was born Patricia Knight in Salford, Greater Manchester, the third of four children of Winifred (nee Kelly), a full-time mother who did voluntary work for the British Legion, and Joe Knight, who had a variety of jobs and in later years was a driving instructor. After leaving St Gilbert’s elementary school in Eccles at the age of 14, she had various jobs, including at WH Smith and Turners Asbestos, and in 1951 married a fellow leader in the local scout group, George Dale, who was a plant-hire manager in Manchester. Pat and George had 12 children through birth and adoption, and provided a loving home for dozens more through fostering. All the children were on an equal footing. They remember Lake District holidays, catering boxes of Creme Eggs, and a dinner table that somehow magically accommodated however many needed feeding. She kept in touch with her whole family – via phone calls, letters and birthday cards, and, most importantly, the open-door policy at her home, which was regularly utilised. Pat was a valued member of St Matthew’s RC church in Eccles, putting her faith into action through good works, running bring-and-buy fundraisers. She continued to lead Guides and Scouts. One of her favourite sayings was: “A Girl Guide has courage and is cheerful in all difficulties.” It worked for her, too. Pat enjoyed opportunities to travel, visiting her eldest brother in the US, seeing her children working abroad, from Kenya to Mauritius, and trips to Rome, Israel and Palestine. Closer to home, she made friends wherever she went, using train journeys to knit and invite conversation. She once wrote to Nigel Farage, informing him in no uncertain terms that the country has lots of space for all who need refuge. Pat had time for everyone and there was always plenty of soup and apple crumble to go round. She never thought highly of herself for all the good she did, instead seeing it as a privilege to be a part of others’ lives. George died in 2013.
