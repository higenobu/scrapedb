5/13/2022,"STATELINE, Nev. (AP) — They found no trace of a mythical sea monster, no sign of mobsters in cement shoes or long-lost treasure chests. But scuba divers who spent a year cleaning up Lake Tahoe’s entire 72-mile (115-kilometer) shoreline have come away with what they hope will prove much more valuable: tons and tons of trash. In addition to removing 25,000 pounds (11,339 kilograms) of underwater litter since last May, divers and volunteers have been meticulously sorting and logging the types and GPS locations of the waste. The dozens of dives that concluded this week were part of a first-of-its-kind effort to learn more about the source and potential harm caused by plastics and other pollutants in the storied alpine lake on the California-Nevada line. It's also taken organizers on a journey through the history, folklore and development of the lake atop the Sierra Nevada that holds enough water to cover all of California 14 inches (36 centimeters) deep. The Washoe Tribe fished the turquoise-blue Tahoe for centuries before westward expansion in the mid-1800s brought railroads, timber barons and eventually Gatsby-like decadence to what became a playground for the rich and famous. Tahoe’s first casino was built in 1902 by Elias J. “Lucky” Baldwin, who owned a big chunk of east Los Angeles and built the prominent Santa Anita horse track in 1907. Massive lakefront estates followed for decades, including one used for the filming of “Godfather II."" Cleanup organizers say one of the things locals ask most is whether they’ve found any gangsters’ remains near the north shore. That’s where Frank Sinatra lost his gaming license for allegedly fraternizing with organized crime bosses at his Cal-Neva hotel-casino in the 1960s. The recovered debris mostly has consisted of things like bottles, tires, fishing gear and sunglasses. But Colin West, founder of the nonprofit environmental group that launched the project, Clean Up the Lake, said there have been some surprises. Divers think they spotted shipwreck planks near Dead Man’s Point, where tribal tales tell of a Loch-Ness-Monster-like creature — later dubbed “Tahoe Tessie″— living beneath Cave Rock. They've also turned up a few “No Littering” signs, engine blocks, lamp posts, a diamond ring and “those funny, fake plastic owls that sit on boats to scare off birds,” West said. “It’s shocking to see how much trash has accumulated under what appears to be such a pristine lake,” said Matt Levitt, founder and CEO of Tahoe Blue Vodka, which has contributed $100,000 to the cleanup. His businesses is among many — including hotels, casinos and ski resorts — dependent on the 15 million-plus people who visit annually to soak up the view Mark Twain described in “Roughing It” in 1872 as the ""fairest picture the whole earth affords.” “It is our economic engine,” Levitt said. And while most contributors and volunteers were motivated primarily to help beautify the lake, it’s what happens once the litter is piled ashore that excites scientists. Shoreline cleanups have occurred across the nation for years, from Arizona to the Great Lakes, Pennsylvania and Florida. But that litter goes into recycle bins and garbage bags for disposal. Each piece from 189 separate Tahoe dives to depths of 25 feet (8 meters) was charted by GPS and meticulously divided into categories including plastic, metal and cloth. Plastics are key because international research increasingly shows some types can break down into smaller pieces known as microplastics. Scientists are still studying the extent and human harm from the tiny bits. But the National Academy of Sciences said in December the U.S. — the world’s top plastics-waste producer — should reduce plastics production because so much winds up in oceans and waterways. Zoe Harrold, a biochemist, led scientists at the Desert Research Institute in Reno that first documented microplastics in Tahoe in 2019. She was the lead author of Clean Up the Lake’s 2021 report on a 6-mile (10-kilometer) pilot project. “If left in place, the ongoing degradation of submerged litter, particularly plastic and rubber, will continue to slowly release microplastics and leachates into Lake Tahoe’s azure waters,” Harrold wrote. The cleanup comes a half-century after scientists started measuring Tahoe’s waning clarity as the basin began to experience explosive growth. Most credit, or blame, completion of the interstate system for the 1960 Winter Olympics near Tahoe City. The first ever televised, it introduced the world to the lake surrounded by snow-covered peaks. From 1960-80, Tahoe’s population grew from 10,000 to 50,000 — 90,000 in the summer, the U.S. Geological Survey said. Peak days now approach 300,000. “The majority of what we’re pulling out is a result of basically just the human impact of recreating, living and building a community here in the Lake Tahoe region,” West said. His group plans dives this year at other Sierra lakes, including June Lake east of Yosemite National Park, and will expand future Tahoe searches to deeper depths. The non-profit Tahoe Fund, which also helped raise $100,000 for the cleanup effort, is commissioning artists to create a sculpture made from Tahoe's trash at an events center being built in Stateline, on the lake's south shore. ""Our hope is that it will inspire greater environmental stewardship and remind those who love Lake Tahoe that it's up to all of us to take care of it,” Tahoe Fund CEO Amy Berry said.",U.S./Associated Press,"No sea serpents, mobsters but Tahoe trash divers strike gold",https://news.yahoo.com/no-sea-serpents-mobsters-tahoe-050324633.html

They are requesting the sum if the couple does not have a child in the next year. A couple in India are taking legal action against their son and his wife, accusing the younger couple of inflicting ""mental cruelty"" on them by not producing a grandchild. Sanjeev Prasad, 61, and his wife Sadhana, 57, say their son Shrey Sagar and his wife Shubhangi Sinha should pay them $650,000 if the couple does not give them a grandchild within a year, according to the BBC. The older couple, who live in the northern Indian state of Uttarakhand, told the Times of India that the sum is what they spent on Shrey, who is now 35. This includes a $65,000 bill for Shrey's pilot training in the US in 2006 and a luxury car gifted during their nuptials. ""I have only one son. I spent all my savings on his upbringing and education,"" Sanjeev Prasad told the Times of India. ""He returned to India in 2007 due to the economic recession abroad. He had lost his job and could not find another for over two years. I supported him financially during this period as well."" He added that he arranged a marriage for his son with Shubhangi, now 31, after the younger man finally secured a job. However, he accused the couple of ""immense mental harassment"" by not giving them a child despite being married for six years now. Sanjeev Prasad said the young couple lives in separate states because of work, and that their daughter-in-law doesn't stay with them, which has ""added to (their) sufferings"" and caused the older couple ""immense pain."" The couple's lawyer, AK Srivastava, told local news outlet ANI News that the case ""portrays the truth of society."" ""We invest in our children, make them capable of working in good firms. Children owe their parents basic financial care,"" the lawyer said, adding that the pair either wanted a grandchild within a year, or monetary compensation. Srivastava also told The National that the older couple was suing ""because of mental cruelty"". ""It is a dream of every parent to become a grandparent,"" the lawyer said. ""They had been waiting for years to become grandparents."" The BBC reported that the Prasads' court petition has a court date for May 17.

5/13/2022,"Over a year after the installation of a comfort women statue in Mitte of central Berlin, Japan’s Prime Minister Fumio Kishida asked German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to remove the statue.

“Comfort women” is a euphemism for the women from mostly Asian nations who were enslaved into brothels by the Japanese military during World War II.

A pro-Korean civic group erected the statue in September 2020 with the approval of local authorities. The installation was allowed to stay for one year and was extended for an extra year.

In October 2020, the Mitte district initially requested for a local Korean group to remove the statue before deciding to leave it. Berlin’s mayor, Michael Müller, also advocated for a future memorial that addresses sexual violence in broader terms.

Japan has repeatedly made requests to the Mitte district that the statue’s permit be removed. The Mitte district has denied the requests and expressed hope that Japan and South Korea would reach an agreement on the statue’s presence.

During a press conference on Wednesday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno shared that during a meeting in late April between Kashida and Scholz in Tokyo, Kashida expressed continued disappointment to the German at the statue’s continued installation.

“The prime minister said it was extremely regrettable to see the comfort women statue remain and sought cooperation again from the German side,” Matsuno said per Kyodo News. “We will approach various parties concerned, tenaciously explain our government’s stance and call for swift removal of the statue.”

As tensions over the issue of recognizing comfort women persist between South Korea and Japan, activists and remaining survivors are continuing to fight for justice “until the very end.""

5/13/2022,"Whether you’re the queen of England or a newborn baby, everyone pees. The average person flushes five to six times a day, but urine is not something most people typically keep a close eye on — unless they suddenly notice an unusual color in the toilet. Despite what you might have heard, clear urine is not the only hallmark of good health. A range of colors is acceptable. Urine is made up of excess water, electrolyte salts and other waste. The kidneys produce urine, which finds its way into the bladder and is later excreted. The bladder fills up, and eventually reaches a point when it can’t hold anymore, which causes the sensation that informs you that you must make a visit to the bathroom. This process is necessary because it’s harmful to have too much water in your system. Dr. Mark Ellerkmann, director of the Center for Urogynecology at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, tells Yahoo Life that toxins in the body and bloodstream need to be eliminated. As the kidneys filter the blood, they remove toxins and extra water to make urine. Of course, if your pee is coming out a blood orange color, it’s normal to be concerned. Some health conditions can change the color of urine. Fortunately, experts say, there are also many nonmedical reasons for such changes. Ellerkmann says that the shade can depend on urine concentration, which influences a natural pigment called urochrome. When the urine is more concentrated (with less water and more waste product), it’s darker. When you’re hydrated, the urine is less concentrated and you have a clear or light color. Other things, for example, your medication, your diet and any infections you may experience, can cause the urine to change color. “Your color can vary depending on your hydration status. Any transient changes in urine color should not alarm you,” Ellerkmann says. The color of your urine can serve as a window to your health. If your urine is yellow… If you’re well-hydrated, your urine will probably be a clear or light yellow. Ellerkmann explains that this has to do with maintaining a balance of fluids as the kidneys eliminate excess fluid in the body. “We don’t want to become dehydrated, but we also don’t want to become over-hydrated,” he says. “This whole concept of homeostasis and fluid management is something the kidneys handle.” When a person is getting enough water, the kidney flushes out the excess, leaving a clear, lighter color. With dehydration, the kidney holds on to the fluids, and the urine is darker. “Generally, I tell patients to drink enough water to keep their urine light yellow, but that amount can be different for everybody,” Dr. Jason Kim, associate professor of urology at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University and director of the Women's Pelvic Health and Continence Center at Stony Brook Medicine, tells Yahoo Life. If your urine is orange… One of the most common explanations for orange urine is medication. Kim explains that pyridium is frequently prescribed for urinary tract infections (UTIs), and that one of its side effects is that it turns urine a reddish-orange. This is a sign that the medicine is doing its job, and the color will go away once you stop taking the medication. Some laxatives and certain chemotherapy drugs have the same effect. Kim says taking high amounts of vitamin also produce a bright yellow or orange urine. These vitamins, such as riboflavin, are water-soluble and not completely absorbed by the body. When there is too much vitamin B, the kidneys filter and remove the excess, resulting in a lot of bright yellow to orange urine. Another nutrient responsible for orange urine is beta carotene, the pigment that gives carrots its orange color. If your urine has a blue or green tint… Kim says medications including some anesthetics, such as propofol, have occasionally turned urine blue. For those undergoing a procedure or medical intervention, doctors can sometimes use certain dyes that can make the urine look blue. Eating foods with strong food coloring dyes can also cause urine to turn a shade of blue or green. If your urine is brown… If you're dehydrated, your urine may have a brown hue to it. Kim says dark brown urine indicates you're not drinking enough fluids, because your urine is too concentrated. But if you’re chugging water regularly, Ellerkmann says one reason for brown urine is that you’ve recently eaten some blackberries. If that’s the case, he says the urine color change is harmless and probably means you have just eaten a lot of the fruit in a short time. However, according to the Mayo Clinic, some liver and kidney disorders, as well as some urinary tract infections, can turn urine dark brown and warrant a doctor’s visit. If your urine is cloudy… Cloudy urine and a burning sensation or difficulty urinating can be a sign of a urinary tract infection. Kim says it’s important to see your doctor for a workup and get the right antibiotics for quick relief. If your urine is dark or red… While reddish pee can be due to eating certain types of produce — “some vegetables with vitamin B, rhubarb or beets can cause red urine,” notes Kim — a dark hue may represent blood in the urine, also called hematuria. Ellerkmann says this can be caused by several conditions involving the bladder and kidneys. “If it has more of a coffee grounds appearance, that would be very concerning,” he says. It can be a sign of blood in the urine from kidney stones, kidney cancer or bladder cancer. One indicator that dark urine is from blood, says Ellerkmann, is if it continues to show up for several days. “Persistent bright-red blood, bloody urine or very dark-colored urine should be evaluated,” he says. Blood in the urine is never normal and can signal a serious medical condition that should alert you to see your health care provider or a urologist immediately. A range of health problems involves blood in the urine, including: Kidney stones Cancer Urinary tract infection Kidney disease Bladder disease “The American Medical Association recommends a workup if there's blood in the urine, and this would include specialized urine tests, along with some sort of imaging tests such as a CAT [computerized tomography] scan and a cystoscopy,” Kim explains.

5/13/2022,"As the only student of Asian descent at her high school in Puerto Rico, Keishla He was used to sticking out. So when He — who is of Chinese descent and was born and raised in Puerto Rico — started posting on TikTok in Spanish, comments rolled in expressing surprise at her fluency in her native language. The 20-year-old began sharing more of her identity online and quickly drew an audience. Since her first videos in 2020, He has amassed more than 1.8 million followers. “I know I’m not the only Asian that was born here in Puerto Rico and was raised here,” He told NBC Asian America. “So I wanted to be that person that they can look up to and say, ‘OK, I’m not the only one,’ so they don’t feel alone.” She began posting at the start of the pandemic to speak out about the spike in racist language against Asian communities. But what garnered more attention, she said, was her fluency in Spanish. As those questions came in, He began posting more content in her native language and addressing commenters’ confusion. Many of her videos involve He sharing anecdotes about her life, entertaining followers with her rapid storytelling and sense of humor. Oftentimes, she switches fluidly from Spanish to English to Cantonese, as she recounts conversations with strangers and family members. For He, educating others usually doesn’t start with explicit conversations about her identity, but with embracing her heritage and responding to the continual flow of comments expressing shock or skepticism. He’s TikToks are often flooded with support from other Boricuas who share her cultural pride and encourage her to embrace her background. But she’s also gotten some pushback. “I started receiving a lot of hate saying that I should stop saying that I was Puerto Rican just because I was born here or raised here,” He said. “I was really confused. And that’s when I decided, since nobody’s talking about this, I decided to be the first one to talk about it, to be proud of my roots.” Though the Chinese Boricua community makes up a small percentage of the island’s overall population, these Puerto Ricans have generations of history tying them to the territory. After the Chinese Exclusion Act passed in 1882, many Chinese in the continental United States fled to Puerto Rico and found work there. These migrants contributed heavily to reconstructing the island’s infrastructure and rail transport systems after the Spanish-American War, which resulted in Spain ceding Puerto Rico to the U.S. in 1898. Many Chinese laborers had settled permanently there, but the U.S. soon extended the Exclusion Act to include this new territory — stunting further immigration until all of the country’s various exclusion laws against Chinese immigrants were repealed in 1943. The U.S. Census reports people of Asian descent make up just 0.2 percent of Puerto Rico’s population. Like many Asian Americans across the country, He said the isolation she felt as a child — from being bullied for the shape of her eyes, her food or the language she spoke at home — at times pushed her to reject her Chinese identity. But after years of trying to “be more Puerto Rican,” He said she wanted to embrace both cultures without shame. So when she noticed a dearth of Asian Boricuas making content about their identities, she decided to fill that gap and help expose people to the diversity of Puerto Rican communities. Her parents had immigrated from China and started a restaurant on the island, He said, but they never spoke up about the prejudice they faced. “I have the ability to speak up, so why shut my mouth when something is wrong?” she said. “Why not express my point of view to get other people to think?” Spanish is He’s primary language, but she speaks Cantonese with family and learned English in school. Lately, the multilingual content creator has also been practicing Mandarin and picking up the basics of Korean, inspired by her love for Korean dramas. K-dramas were a source of comfort for He as a child, she said, because of the minimal Asian representation she saw in mainstream Western entertainment. He, who is now in her second year of university, said her experiences growing up have taught her the importance of staying true to herself. “Don’t be harsh on yourself and don’t be harsh on others,” He said. “I know that not having knowledge doesn’t excuse you from doing bad things, but give them a chance to learn.”",U.S./NBC News,Chinese Puerto Rican TikToker goes viral for explaining multicultural identity,https://news.yahoo.com/chinese-puerto-rican-tiktoker-goes-183329401.html
5/13/2022,"After Korie Roberston shared her stance on abortion in a Live Original blog post, the site went down for more than a day. The Duck Dynasty mom of six uploaded the post on Tuesday to share her thoughts on abortion in light of the leaked Supreme Court draft opinion to overturn Roe v. Wade. The essay started out with Roberton's hesitation to comment on the topic. ""I've gone around and around about whether or not to post about the abortion debate going on in our country. I know how personal and emotional this issue is, and the internet can be a rough place to have hard conversations,"" she wrote. ""I have enormous compassion for women who have chosen abortions and know that had to have been a tough decision at an extremely difficult and uncertain time in your life. I hope you know how much you are loved by a God who sees you and was with you even then."" Robertson has not been shy about publicizing her religious values and referenced her faith frequently in the post. She also acknowledged that her opinions might not perfectly align with everyone around her but felt compelled to join the conversation. ""I have friends who think differently than I do about this issue, I love and respect them and am seeing their posts and hearing their passion on the other side than I am, so I decided it's time I throw my thoughts into the arena,"" she noted. Robertson said she might ruffle a few feathers on both sides of the pro-life and pro-choice argument, despite an apparent inclination towards the former. ""I realize that my writing this could be risky. I won't say it all right. People will disagree. I'll likely write something that even my friends or followers on the pro-life side disagree with, too. That's okay. It's too important of a conversation to ignore or to just stay silent so here we go ... "" She opens her statement with a vocabulary critique, likening the term ""pro-choice"" to deliberate propaganda, saying, ""One of the things that deeply disturbs me right off the bat is the term ""pro-choice."" I actually think it was a brilliant marketing decision. It implies that if you aren't for abortion or ""for choice,"" then you are against women having the right to choose what happens to their bodies. And that is such a false narrative that I can't help but speak out."" She goes on to explain that she does support a woman's right to choose — however, specifying in what instances: to prevent pregnancy, put children up for adoption and raise babies. ""I 100% support a woman's right to choose what happens to her body. I'm also incredibly thankful that there are a multitude of choices that are available to women in our day and age before and besides the choice to end the life inside her womb,"" detailing different birth control options available, adding that Medicaid and Planned Parenthood can help. Robertson believes men bear responsibility too. ""I'm not letting men off the hook here. A man should always consider the consequences of his action to have unprotected sex. Condoms should always be the choice for protection from pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. Men should be equally responsible. Women you have the right and the power to demand a condom when having sex,"" she asserts.    A post shared by Korie Robertson (@bosshogswife) Incest and rape are two key pillars frequently used in pro-choice arguments and Robertson chose to address this perspective as well. ""I also believe in the woman's right over her own body to choose whether or not to have sex in the first place. I understand that there are circumstances of rape and incest that sadly take away this choice,"" she wrote, adding that these men are taking away a woman's right to choose, not those against abortion. ""The men who perpetrate those acts are the ones who don't allow a woman to choose, not those on the side of pro-life."" The former reality TV star continued to list more ""choices"" women can make instead of terminating their pregnancy, including adoption, calling it ""beautiful and heroic"" before writing that there are ""literally millions of parents on waiting lists to adopt babies in our country."" She also quoted an unknown and unverified source that claims ""there are as many as 36 waiting families for every 1 baby placed for adoption."" Robertson's final ""choice"" for those with unwanted pregnancies is simply keeping and raising the baby. Concerning arguments that those who are pro-life don't care about the well-being of the children once they are born, Robertson believes it is simply not true. Finally, while seeming to support a woman's right to choose initially, Robertson makes her stance on abortion undeniably clear: ""In the end, I don't believe the killing of babies in the womb should be legal in this country, and I don't believe this is a woman's rights issue."" In an email to subscribers with the blog's full text, Live Original shared that their website server “happened to go down…” LiveOriginal.com, which was back up and running on Thursday afternoon, was down for more than 24 hours.

Scientists believe they have finally discovered the trigger for the world’s biggest climate catastrophe. The catastrophe in question took place around 252 million years ago. At the time, the world was going through a “tumultuous period of rapid global warming.” Many previously believed that a volcanic eruption in Siberia was the cause. However, new evidence shows that the climate of the world was already changing. Researchers published a new study in the journal Nature, which confirms several super-eruptions in eastern Australia could have helped expedite the climate change all those millions of years ago.

These super-eruptions could have been a great primer for the massive climate change that the world was going through at the time. During these eruptions, researchers believe the eruptions spewed massive amounts of gasses and ash into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gas emissions have always been a leading cause of rising global temperatures. The levels of gas that these eruptions would have unleashed would have easily played a part in the world’s biggest climate catastrophe. The researchers say that the spread of the ash produced is consistent with some of the largest volcanic eruptions that we know of. Additionally, the researchers say that evidence of the eruptions, and their source, can be found in the eroded remnants of volcanoes preserved in the New England region of New South Wales. Further, as the researchers note, layers of light-colored volcanic ash can be found buried in the sedimentary rock. They found these layers across massive areas of New South Wales and even Queensland. Even more intriguing, though, is the scale of the super-eruptions. It makes sense that they would have been big, especially if they helped cause the world’s biggest climate catastrophe. The authors of the study believe that the volcanoes spewed at least 150,000 km³ of material into northern New South Wales over the course of those four million years. For comparison, the deadly eruption of Mt. St. Helens in 1980 was roughly 1 km³ of rock and material. Even the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79AD would have only been around 3-4 km³. The researchers involved in the study also published a detailed article breaking down their findings on The Conversation. You can read through their thoughts about the research directly.

5/13/2022,"By Tim Kelly MIYAKO ISLAND (Reuters) - Seihan Nakazato wants the missile trucks on the base next to his melon farm to leave, but few others on Okinawa's Miyako island, he complains, are demanding that Japan's army remove such weapons, which he says would make them a target for China. ""We are a small community and there are lots of complicated relationships,"" said Nakazato, 68, standing next to one of the greenhouses he worries could be bombed. ""Some islanders do work for the base and others have relatives in the military."" As Nakazato harvests his melons on Japan's key border outpost, Okinawa on Sunday marks 50 years since the United States ended its occupation, raising hopes of a return to normality after its devastation in World War Two. But the East China Sea island chain, which, along with Taiwan, hems in Beijing's forces, fears it will become a battlefield again. ""We are worried about statements by national lawmakers that a Taiwan contingency would be a Japan contingency, and recent discussions that seem to assume Okinawa would be involved in an armed conflict,"" Okinawa's governor Denny Tamaki said at a news conference on May 6. The prefecture has about 1.4 million people, most of them on the eponymous main island. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to those concerns, with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning of the fragility of security in Asia. And Japanese lawmakers from Kishida's party have said they want strike missiles added to the country's arsenal - a weapon that could be deployed to Okinawa. China, which spends almost five times as much on defence as Japan, says it intentions in the region are peaceful. ""Okinawa will be the front line in the case of a war or conflict between Japan and China,"" said Masaaki Gabe, a professor emeritus at the University of Ryukyus on Okinawa's main island, who described himself as an insecure 17-year-old when the U.S. occupation ended. ""After 50 years, the insecure feeling still continues,"" he added. STRATEGIC VALUE Fringed with coral reefs and covered in sugar cane, Gabe's home island is a vital military outpost. It has two airports, a large port and is less than 400 kilometres (249 miles) from Taiwan. It is also 200km from uninhabited islands in the East China Sea that are the focal point of an intensifying territorial dispute with China. The Ground Self Defense Force (GSDF) camp next to Nakazato's farm, which used to be a golf course, is Japan's newest army base. The missiles deployed there, meant to target Chinese ships sailing in and out the Western Pacific, are the closest such weapons Japan has to China. ""I fear the whole island will become a fortress,"" said Hayako Shimizu, 73, the leader of a group of protesters opposed to the base, who stand outside every Thursday with flags planted on Nakazato's land. ""There aren't many people who speak up, although I think a lot of people are unhappy with it,"" Shimizu added. Base commander Colonel Masakazu Iyota, 52, thinks most islanders support or accept the presence of the 700 GSDF troops and their equipment, which he described as a ""frontline deterrence"". ""I don't think our current posture is enough,"" he said. NEXT STEPS Iyota may get reinforcements after Japan revises its national security strategy this year. As part of that review, ruling LDP lawmakers have said they want a commitment to more defence spending - including on missiles that can hit targets on foreign soil. Japan may hold off on deploying such strike weapons to Miyako to avoid provoking China, only 600km away, but Gabe predicts the country will station aircraft and other missiles in Okinawa. The next phase of military expansion on Miyako could be at its Shimoji airport, a former senior defence ministry official told Reuters, asking not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Built to train jumbo jet pilots, it has been a symbol of resistance to militarization since Okinawa's first post-occupation governor, Chobyo Yara, secured a government promise to never deploy military planes there. Senior ruling Liberal Democratic party lawmakers such as Masahisa Sato have sought to annul that. ""Apart from the main Okinawa island, it is the only other place an F-15 fighter jet can operate from,"" said Sato, a former deputy defence minister, who proposed stationing air force jets there in 2020. ""As we have seen in Ukraine, you never know when war will break out."" ISLAND POLITICS Kishida's party will need local support in Okinawa to build more bases, a tough proposition when resentment over U.S. forces there dominates politics. Of 812 Okinawans polled by public broadcaster NHK in March, 56% said they strongly opposed U.S. bases; only a quarter of 1,115 people outside the prefecture said the same. A test of whether the LDP can gain ground comes in September, when Okinawa chooses its governor. Tamaki, an independent who wants a smaller military footprint, is on the ballot. On Miyako, Masahiro Hamamoto, 48, who served as an LDP city councilor for eight years, sees a chance for his party to gain support on his island, which depends on farming, tourism and public works spending. ""There is a sense that it benefits the island by having closer political links to central government,"" said the local beverage and cigarette wholesaler, who was born two years after Okinawa was returned to Japan. The income of Miyako's 55,000 residents is about 70% of the national average. ""The economy isn't good, so people will vote for the LDP,"" said Toshiaki Shimoji, 61, an Okinawa main island resident who traveled to Miyako to work his family's farm. ""Russia invaded Ukraine, so there will be more defence spending and that could mean more missiles here. I don't think base protests will change anything,"" he added, sitting on a tractor in a sugar cane field.

5/13/2022,"Felix Kjellberg, popularly known as PewDiePie on YouTube, has moved to Japan with his wife Marzia and their pet dogs.

The Swedish gaming streamer, who has over 111 million subscribers on YouTube, documented their journey from London to Japan in his latest video upload published on May 10.

 

In the 14-minute clip, Kjellberg is seen getting his 5-year business visa approved and trying to sort out the best way to relocate from Brighton, where he has lived since 2013, with his pugs, whose breathing issues prevent them from traveling through cargo.

Not wanting to risk the safety of their pets, the couple rented a private jet.

""We're flying private jet because my dog is too fat,"" Kjellberg said in jest.

The move had been a long-time dream for Kjellberg, who has often talked about purchasing a house in Japan back in 2019.

""For so long we doubted whether we could even make this move, and we went through all the ups and downs, and obviously it's been a really long journey,"" Kjellberg said in the video. ""But I just really, really appreciate everyone who was supportive of us going ... it just feels amazing to be here, finally.""

The YouTuber told his viewers that they are “going to take some days to settle in” and “can't wait for the next chapter of [their] lives.”

Kjellberg was able to finally make the move after Japan relaxed its COVID-19 entry rules for some visa-holders.

While the country remains closed to tourists, Japan started opening up its borders to allow in foreign business visitors, students and other new residents in March.

5/13/2022,"The woman who last summer discovered the bodies of a newlywed couple in Moab, Utah says that police told her recently they had begun to doubt her story—until Wednesday night, when authorities publicly identified someone else as a suspect. In the meantime, Cindy Sue Hunter lived in constant dread of being framed for something she didn’t do, and became a pariah in her neighborhood, she told The Daily Beast on Thursday. Hunter, 64, found the remains of Kylen Schulte, 24, and Crystal Beck, 38, in the La Sal Mountains four days after they vanished last August. The two, who had earlier told friends about being spooked by a “creepy” guy they encountered while camping in the area, had been shot to death. The shocking double homicide made national headlines and set Moab’s 5,200 residents on edge. It was an especially unbearable loss for Schulte’s parents, who had already lost a teenage son to gunfire in 2015. Hunter first met Schulte the following year, and had become friendly with her father, Sean-Paul. After the two went missing, Hunter said she became frustrated with what she viewed as a lackadaisical search-and-rescue effort by law enforcement. So, she went off to look for the women on her own. Hunter started at the McDonald’s where Beck worked, and where she and Schulte parked their camper van. As she told The Daily Beast at the time, Hunter “wanted to feel their energy and get a sense of where they were.” She then drove up to the mountains, driving around for several hours while “talking out loud to the girls, begging them to give me a sign.” As she wound her way through the wilderness, Hunter described feeling something she couldn’t quite explain. “When I went to turn on Lake Warner, I don’t want to say I had voices in my head, but I was told to ‘Go straight and hurry,’” she said. “It just kept repeating. I’m going toward Sand Flats Road, and out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of silver through the trees and I saw a campsite down a tricky little side road. Very easy to miss. And that’s when I found their car.” Footage Shows Last Time Slain Camping Couple Seen Alive Hunter then stumbled upon Schulte’s body, and ran back to her own car. She locked the doors and called police. When officers arrived, they found Beck’s remains, according to Hunter. In the aftermath, Hunter was celebrated by the community as a hero for locating the women and bringing some semblance of closure to their families. But her small art supply store was unable to weather the pandemic, and Hunter was forced to close and leave town. Then, a week after she moved in to a new place, her life was truly upended. “They served me with a warrant last month and told me I was a suspect,” Hunter told The Daily Beast. “It scared me so badly, I felt like I was going to be framed for this fricking murder.” Three carloads of deputies from the Grand County Sheriff’s Office showed up at Hunter’s new home and dropped a bombshell on her, she recalled. “They said that my story kept changing, which it did not,” according to Hunter, who said she had taken photographs of the crime scene with her phone to formally document her discovery. “They said that my phone pinged up there [near the murder scene], and I said, Of course it did—I told them that I went up there walking several times a week in the summer… They told me it wasn’t usual for people to take pictures at a crime scene. So they thought I might be hiding something. That’s basically what they told me.” Hunter, whose phone was seized by the deputies, said she has been treated “horribly,” and that she is considering suing the sheriff’s office over the surreal turn of events. “All I did was find them, and because of the way I found them, that made me a suspect,” Hunter said on Thursday. “They don't believe in [the] supernatural. I found them in a way that doesn't make sense to them, so that made me a suspect.” Yesterday, authorities in Grand County identified 45-year-old drifter Adam Pinkusiewicz as the alleged killer. Pinkusiewicz, who died by suicide in September, worked at the same McDonald’s as Beck, according to Grand County Sheriff Steven White. In a statement, White said Pinkusiewicz was “in the La Sals and Moab at the time of the homicides,” and fled the state shortly thereafter. Before he died, Pinkusiewicz “told another party that he had killed two women in Utah and provided specific details that were known only to investigators,” White said in a statement, adding that the investigation remains open. Since his daughter’s murder, Sean-Paul Schulte has maintained a presence in Moab, manning a “clue booth” to receive any tips people might have. He told a local radio station that he first heard Pinkusiewicz’s name “months and months ago” as “one of many persons of interest,” but said detectives had been unable to locate him. Pinkusiewicz was finally identified as a suspect on May 11, just a few days after reality TV star Dog the Bounty Hunter showed up to assist investigators. Investigators are continuing to process “critical and newly discovered evidence” in the case, including Pinkusiewicz’s 2007 Toyota Yaris, which authorities recently located and seized, White said in his statement. But Hunter is still feeling stung by police, whom she said have not yet told her she has been cleared. As a result, she is finding it difficult to feel any sense of closure and is reluctant to take the sheriff’s announcement at face value. “I’m struggling with it because if I hadn’t been pulled in as a suspect, I think I would be elated, overjoyed,” Hunter told The Daily Beast. As it is, she said she would be “questioning how it was handled.” “They didn’t have any answers for us until Dog came to town,” Hunter continued. “We’ve all been waiting for answers for nine months and then Dog comes to town and [suddenly] they know who did it? I hope it was him, and that he’s dead and we don’t have to deal with that monster anymore. But I struggle with the fact that they knew [it was him]… and just let us dangle out here.” The Grand County Sheriff’s Office did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment. Hunter described the past month as “a living hell,” and said she is desperately hoping things will now improve for her. Her new neighbors, who had at first greeted her warmly, suddenly became ice-cold after they saw deputies pull up and “surround” her house, she said. “I moved and I was supposed to be starting a new life,” Hunter explained. “And [when the police came], all the neighbors saw, and no one will talk to me now. Prior to that happening, people would come to my door, give me their phone numbers, welcoming me to the neighborhood. Not one of them will answer the phone or return my calls. They don’t wave anymore. It has definitely hurt me.” Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.

5/13/2022,"WILSONS, Va. (AP) — Soon after Jim Medeiros bought his 143-acre (58-hectare) cattle and poultry farm in rural Virginia a decade ago, he and his wife were startled by the sounds of 20 hunting dogs barking and howling as they circled their house and chased their chickens. When Medeiros confronted a hunter nearby, the man told him he had permission to hunt on Medeiros’ property. In disbelief, Medeiros called the agency that enforces a state law allowing hunters to retrieve their hunting dogs from private property, even when the property owners object. “He told me, you can't prohibit people from coming onto your land,” recalled Medeiros. He then pointed out that his land was posted with no trespassing signs. “I said, 'You don't understand. My land is posted,'"" Medeiros said. “You don't understand,"" the official responded. “You can't stop them.” After years of putting up with baying dogs and dead chickens, Medeiros and several other property owners are suing the state over its “right to retrieve” law, arguing that allowing hunters to go on their property without permission amounts to an uncompensated taking of their land and violates the state and federal constitutions. A number of states allow hunters to retrieve their dogs without permission from property owners under certain circumstances, such as properties that do not have “no trespassing” signs. But Virginia's law says hunters are allowed to retrieve dogs even when the property owner has specifically denied access. A 2016 report prepared by the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, (now the Department of Wildlife Resources), said only one other state, Minnesota, had a similar law. Minnesota's law says a person can enter private land to retrieve a hunting dog without permission of the owner, but cannot have a firearm when doing so and must immediately leave after recovering the dog. Virginia's law prohibits hunters from carrying guns or bows and arrows while retrieving their dogs from private property. It also says hunters must identify themselves when asked by the landowner. If they refuse, they can be charged with a misdemeanor. The Virginia property owners are suing the Department of Wildlife Resources, which enforces the law. They are represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation, a conservative legal organization that won a major property rights case at the U.S. Supreme Court last year. The high court found that a California regulation requiring agricultural businesses to allow union organizers onto their property for up to three hours a day, 120 days per year, amounts to the government appropriating “a right of access to private property” and “constitutes a per se physical taking” under the court's precedents. Daniel Woislaw, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, said he believes Virginia's “right to retrieve” law amounts to a similar physical taking of private property. “When Jim has to let deer dogs and deer dog hunters enter his property, and he's not allowed to tell them to stay away, and when they're killing his livestock and disrupting his operations, that's a taking of a valuable property interest,"" Woislaw said. The law itself was first put on the books in 1938, but the tradition of hunting with dogs dates back 400 years to colonial times, said Kirby Burch, a bear hunter who owns eight hunting dogs and is the chief executive officer of the Virginia Hunting Dog Alliance, a political action committee that represents about 90,000 hunters in the state. Burch said most hunters try to be considerate of land owners and quickly retrieve their dogs when they cross onto private property. “A lot a people who move here from other states are offended by the notion of hunting with dogs so when a dog runs across their property, they're offended, and I understand that, but I think the vast majority of hunters with dogs try in every way possible to avoid irritating their neighbors,"" said Burch, 75, who has been hunting with dogs since he was 5. Burch's group estimates that more than half of the 254,000 licensed hunters in Virginia hunt with dogs. The lawsuit asks the court for a judgment declaring that the law takes the plaintiffs' private property without compensation for public use, a violation of the state constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Multiple attempts have been made in the legislature to overturn the law, but none have succeeded. Ryan Brown, executive director of the Department of Wildlife Resources, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Brown said hunters and private landowners have been able to peacefully co-exist for the most part, but as more rural land has been developed and Virginia has become more suburbanized, the  two groups have been at loggerheads over the hunting dog issue. “Both sides of the debate have vested interests, with the hunters being very interested in the protection of their hunting dogs and real property owners being interested in protection of their rights as land owners,” Brown said. “Both sides have been very passionate about their views.”",U.S./Associated Press,Private property owners sue over Virginia's hunting dog law,https://news.yahoo.com/private-property-owners-sue-over-141505922.html

5/13/2022,"The Japanese yen shows ""significant value"" as a hedge against a US recession, Goldman Sachs said. Goldman Sachs said part of its bullishness towards the yen is how cheap it is compared with other typical safe-havens. The bank said there's a strong chance of the Bank of Japan intervening to support the yen, given global market volatility. Goldman Sachs believes the Japanese yen is an ideal hedge against the risk of a US recession, which the investment bank believes is a possiblity in the coming two years. In a research note published on Tuesday, Goldman analysts, led by Karen Reichgott Fishman, noted that the yen is trading at ""extremely cheap levels"" and is undervalued aga ins the dollar to the tune of 20-25%. ""In other words, the yen is now trading at historically cheap levels and screens as the cheapest safe haven asset by far—at a time when global recession risk is on the rise,"" Fishman wrote. Fishman said the yen looked especially cheap compared with other traditional safe haven currencies such as the US dollar or the Swiss franc. The yen has been diving against the dollar and reached a 20-year low last week, partly because of the widening gap between US and Japanese interest rates, as the Bank of Japan has left monetary policy unchanged, while the Federal Reserve is in an aggressive tightening cycle to combat inflation running at 40-year highs. The BoJ meanwhile has pledged to cap the country's 10-year government bond yield at 0.25%, while 10-year Treasuries are yielding more than 3% right now, the biggest difference between the two since late 2018. Fishman said the situation has ""opened up significant value"" for the yen as a hedge against what the bank estimates is a 35% chance of a US recession within the next 24 months. ""Our latest work on FX hedges for key risk scenarios shows that the yen screens as the most effective hedge against a 'risk down, US rates down' shock—or a market backdrop consistent with recessionary pricing."" A rising dollar-yen however, is likely to call for intervention, Fishman noted, especially at a time when commodity prices, like energy, skyrocket as a result of foreign sanctions from Russia's war with Ukraine. ""Over the short-term, amidst highly volatile global markets, the yen will likely be influenced by changes in Treasury yields and commodity prices,"" she said. Given Japan's reliance on energy imports in particular, which are priced in dollars, the extreme weakness in the yen means there is a greater chance the central bank will step in to support the currency and avoid an even bigger increase in inflation. ""The combination of cheap valuation, non-trivial risk of intervention, and, most importantly, rising odds of recession to open up paths to dollar-yen downside,"" she said, referring to the potential for the yen to strengthen against the dollar. ""cheap valuation, non-trivial risk of intervention, and, most importantly, rising odds of recession"" will lead to a dollar-yen downside, meaning a greater opportunity to sell the dollar and buy the yen. ""Cheap valuation and rising odds of recession argue for a more constructive view on the Yen over the next year,"" Fishman said.

5/13/2022,"BRUSSELS (AP) — It’s likely to be the quickest NATO enlargement ever and one that would redraw Europe’s security map. Finnish leaders announced Thursday their belief that Finland should join the world’s biggest military organization because of Russia's war in Ukraine. Sweden could soon follow suit. Should they apply for membership, the move would have far-reaching ramifications for Northern Europe and trans-Atlantic security. No doubt, it will also anger their large neighbor Russia, which blames, at least in part, its war in Ukraine on NATO’s continued expansion closer to its borders. It's unclear how Russian President Vladimir Putin might retaliate. The Kremlin said Thursday that it certainly won't improve European security. The following is a brief look at what Finland and Sweden's membership in the 30-country NATO alliance could mean, with the Nordic partners expected to announce their intention to join within days. FINLAND AND SWEDEN Not neutral like Switzerland, Finland and Sweden traditionally think of themselves as militarily “nonaligned.” But Russia’s war in Ukraine and Putin’s apparent desire to establish a Moscow-centered “sphere of influence” has shaken their security notions to the core. Just days after he ordered the Feb. 24 invasion, public opinion shifted dramatically. Support in Finland for NATO membership has hovered around 20-30% for years. It now stands at over 70%. The two are NATO’s closest partners but maintaining good ties with Russia has been an important part of their foreign policy, particularly for Finland. Now they hope for security support from NATO states — primarily the United States — in case Moscow retaliates. Britain pledged on Wednesday to come to their aid. THE NORDIC REGION NATO membership for the two, joining regional neighbors Denmark, Norway and Iceland, would formalize their joint security and defense work in ways that their Nordic Defense Cooperation pact hasn't. NORDEFCO, as it’s known, focuses on cooperation. Working within NATO means putting forces under joint command. Accession would tighten the strategic Nordic grip on the Baltic Sea — Russia’s maritime point of access to the city of St. Petersburg and its Kaliningrad exclave. Finland and Sweden also join them, along with Iceland, at the heart of the triangle formed with the North Atlantic and maritime areas in the Arctic, to where Russia projects its military might from the northern Kola Peninsula. Integrated NATO military planning will become a lot simpler, making the region easier to defend. NATO Finland and Sweden are NATO’s closest partners. They contribute to the alliance’s operations and air policing. Most importantly, they already meet NATO’s membership criteria, on functioning democracies, good neighborly relations, clear borders and armed forces that are in lock-step with the allies. After the invasion, they formally boosted information exchanges with NATO and sit in on every meeting on war issues. Both are modernizing their armed forces and investing in new equipment. Finland is purchasing dozens of high-end F-35 warplanes. Sweden has top quality fighter jets, the Gripen. Finland says it’s already hit NATO’s defense spending guideline of 2% of gross domestic product. Sweden too is ramping up its military budget and expects to reach the target by 2028. The NATO average was estimated at 1.6% last year. RUSSIA Putin has demanded that NATO stop expanding and in his May 9 speech blamed the West for the war. But public opinion in Finland and Sweden suggests that he has driven them into NATO’s arms. If Finland joins, it would double the length of the alliance’s border with Russia, adding a further 1,300 kilometers (830 miles) for Moscow to defend. Putin has promised a “military, technical” response if they join. But many troops from Russia’s western district near Finland were sent to Ukraine, and those units suffered heavy casualties, Western military officers say. So far, Moscow is doing nothing obvious to dissuade the two — apart perhaps from a couple of incidents where Russian planes entered their airspace. The Kremlin said Thursday that its response could depend on how close NATO infrastructure moves toward Russia's borders. Some at NATO worry that the Russians might deploy nuclear weapons or more hypersonic missiles to the Kaliningrad exclave, across the Baltic Sea wedged between allies Poland and Lithuania. ___ Karl Ritter in Stockholm, and Jari Tanner in Helsinki, contributed to this report.",World/Associated Press,"EXPLAINER: Why Finland, Sweden joining NATO will be big deal",https://news.yahoo.com/explainer-why-finland-sweden-joining-102127032.html
5/13/2022,"A Chinese genius flexed his mathematical prowess by solving a problem that flummoxed a team of mathematicians with Ph.D.s for four months in a single night.

Wei Dongyi, a 30-year-old assistant mathematics professor at Peking University in Beijing, came to the rescue after six mathematicians called him for help as they tried building a complex mathematics model. After using the equations he provided to alter their experiment, the team’s model obtained a passing rate of over 96%.

The mathematicians wanted to pay the professor to show their gratitude, but he declined.

""It’s unnecessary to pay me for such an easy problem,"" he said.

Wei, who became known as “God Wei,” eventually asked for a recharge of his transport card as a form of compensation.

“It is not rare or surprising to us that Wei can solve the puzzle that other people cannot because he is smart and is hyper-focused on math problems,” Chen Dayue, the dean of Peking University’s School of Mathematical Sciences, told Chinese news platform Jiupai News.

Wei was reportedly accepted to Peking University without taking the gaokao, China’s national college entrance exam, due to his math skills and past achievements, including his two consecutive victories at the International Mathematical Olympiad while he was still a high school student.

He also turned down an offer from Harvard, which went so far as to offer an English language waiver and an interpreter so that he could study there as a Ph.D. candidate, his former teacher Zhang Yonghua told Shandong Business News.

Wei’s Peking University faculty profile states that he received his B.S. in Mathematics at the university in 2014 and earned his Ph.D. in the same field four years later.

The professor found himself in the spotlight last year after an awkward interview clip of him went viral. He was mistaken for a student due to his disheveled appearance, simple clothes and giant plastic water bottle.

“He is a disciplined person. We often saw him eat steamed buns accompanied with tofu in the canteen,” one of Wei’s former classmates told City Express. “He studied well and he won scholarships of over 100,000 yuan (US$15,655) a year. But he still lives a plain life, being rustic in both clothing and food.”

5/13/2022,"Warning: This article contains graphic descriptions of violence and child abuse some readers may find disturbing.

Police in Japan have issued new arrest warrants on suspicion of assault and confinement of a 5-year-old boy for three people who were previously arrested after his body was found under their house in Saitama Prefecture in March.

Chika Kakimoto, the boy’s 30-year-old mother, and her unemployed roommates Hiroki Niwa, 34, and Yoko Ishii, 54, allegedly tortured the boy, named Ayumu, leading up to his death this year.

In an incident that took place on Jan. 31 last year, the three reportedly placed Ayumu inside a rainwater tank, which they knocked over and hit with their hands.

The three are also accused of beating Ayumu and hanging him upside down before confining him in a cat cage for more than two hours on May 29 that same year.

The owner of a restaurant that the three suspects and the boy had visited several times was convinced Ayuma was being abused and alerted city officials. The owner said they witnessed Niwa punishing Ayumu harshly by making him sit on his heels for about two hours without eating. When Kakimoto was asked about the treatment, she said it was only to discipline her child.

The municipal government initially concluded there were no signs of child abuse after consulting a local child consultation center and the boy’s nursery school, who claimed that Ayuma had a good relationship with his mother and did not have any signs of bruises on his body.

Ayuma’s body was eventually discovered beneath the floorboards of their house on March 6 this year after city officials reported concerns to police that the child had not been seen in school for about two months and had not moved to Izumi, as his mother claimed in January.

Officers then arrested the three in March on suspicion of abandoning the boy’s body under their floor, leading them to admit to digging a hole to bury Ayuma.

The Saitama Prefectural Police have not revealed how they have pleaded to the more recent assault and confinement charges.

5/13/2022,"By Neil Jerome Morales MANILA (Reuters) -A tycoon and close associate of outgoing Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is considering selling businesses collectively worth several billion dollars, including a South China Sea gas field and a commercial land lease firm at the site of a former U.S. military base, two sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Dennis Uy, chairman of conglomerate Udenna Corp and listed Chelsea Logistics, has seen rapid growth and diversification of his business empire during the six-year presidency of Duterte, who leaves office next month. The assets he is considering selling are the Malampaya gas field, which Uy had acquired from Chevron and Shell for approximately $1 billion, and Clark Global City, which also cost $1 billion, the sources told Reuters, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media. They said buyers had been looking at prospects for some of Uy's other businesses, including oil retailer Phoenix Petroleum and his new telecom firm DITO, plus schools and food businesses he operates. It was not immediately clear why Uy, the top campaign contributor of Duterte in his 2016 presidential run, was putting the assets up for sale. His representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Uy, 48, is one of the Philippines' leading entrepreneurs, whose appetite for risk and acquisitions saw him build the bulk of his empire in just a few years. Udenna Corp nearly quadrupled its portfolio to more than 100 firms in the first four years of the Duterte presidency, in sectors from gaming, shipping, education and construction to fast food, ferries, tourism, telecoms and sports cars. The company has long insisted it received no preferential treatment under Duterte and all businesses and contracts were acquired fairly. Duterte will make way for Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the notorious dictator, who won a presidential election by a landslide on Monday. ANNOUNCEMENT 'IMMINENT' Included in the preferred bidders for deals for Malampaya and Clark Gateway - the developer and landlord of a 177-hectare (437.4-acre) business district near Clark international airport - is billionaire Enrique Razon, one of the sources said. The transactions have been in the works for ""some months already"", the source said, adding ""an announcement looks imminent"". Razon, Philippines' third richest man with a net worth of $5.8 billion based on a Forbes ranking, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His Bloomberry Resorts announced on Wednesday it had signed a deal to invest in Uy's integrated casino-resort projects in Clark and the central province of Cebu. The Malampaya gas field fuels power plants that deliver about a fifth of the Philippines' electricity requirements. In December Uy's Udenna said Malampaya may operate for several more years beyond its projected 2027 project life. The proposed assets sales comes after the pandemic decimated the profitability of many of Uy's businesses. Udenna's total liabilities rose by nearly half to 254 billion pesos ($4.85 billion) in 2020 from 171 billion pesos in 2019, latest available data from the corporate regulator showed.

5/13/2022,"Editor’s note: This article was first published on HistoryNet, our sister publication. Subscribe to its newsletter here. From the time Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his “special military operation” on Feb. 24, 2022, his target, Ukraine, proved to be anything but low-hanging fruit. Ferocious though their resistance was, however, it would not have lasted as long as it did — three months and still counting, as of May 2022 — had it not been the vital weaponry and ammunition provided to the Ukrainians from numerous foreign supporters through what has amounted to a 21st century form of World War II’s Lend-Lease program. Among the most noticeable weapons credited with standing up to overwhelming waves of Russian tanks has been a state-of-the-art, infantry-operated guided missile. The Americans who produced it call it the FGM-148 AAWS-M (for “Advanced Antitank Weapon System-Medium”), but many of its current users have come to call it “Saint Javelin, Protector of Ukraine.” The FGM-148 entered service in 1996 as a replacement for the M47 Dragoon. The latest model is the FGM-148F, and an upgraded FGM-148G is in the works. Weighing 49 pounds, the Javelin has advanced electronics that have progressively improved to afford the operator fire-and-forget capability. Using the attached Command Launch Unit, the operator aims and fires, the missile being spring-ejected before igniting and traveling on toward the target at a rate of 1,000 feet every seven seconds, guided by an infrared seeker in the nose. Upon contact, the foremost of two tandem high-explosive antitank, or HEAT, warheads explodes against the reactive armor, clearing the way for the second warhead to reach the tank’s main armor. The Javelin’s warheads can penetrate steel up to 23.5 inches to 31.5 inches thick. With an effective range over 1.5 miles, the Javelin’s warhead travels 213 feet before it arms — but it does produce a backblast that the user must take into account. Though its range falls below the 2.3-mile effective range of the BGM-71 tube-launched, optically guided, wire-guided, or TOW missile, the Javelin is much lighter and handier for operation by a single trained infantryman. Like the TOW, however, it can be mounted on a vehicle if one is available. The United States has claimed that of the first 112 Javelins it used, 100 hit the targets, both directly and on trajectories from above, where tank armor is thinner and more vulnerable to penetration. The Command Launch Unit, which can magnify targets up to four times, can be removed from the weapon system and used as a lightweight optical device and night sight. Javelins have been sold to military services all over the world, and U.S. Army, U.S. Marine and Australian forces have used them to good effect in Iraq and Afghanistan, where its accuracy at greater ranges than other weapons made it useful against enemy strongpoints as well as moving vehicles. Although it has seen its share of combat since its introduction to service, it has been in Ukraine that the Javelin has attained legendary status. The country had already purchased 210 missiles and 37 launchers in March 2018, for $47 million, followed by another order in June 2020 for $150 million more. These came swiftly into play when Putin sent in the tanks, making the Russian advance a costly one on all fronts. The Ukrainians have claimed more than 230 tanks and armored vehicles destroyed thus far, although it should be noted that they have other antitank weapons that may have contributed to that statistic, as well. Nor is the Javelin without its weaknesses, particularly its vulnerability to losing the contrast necessary for a missile lock at dawn or dusk, or if the target shoots off clouds of infrared-blocking smoke. The principal complaint from Ukrainians about the Javelins, however, is that there never seem to be enough of them. They have already received more than 5,500 missiles, and the United States and other allies have pledged to send more, but they are expensive and time consuming to produce — 6,840 per year at $176,000 per system. In aiding the Ukrainians, the U.S. has sent off as much as two-thirds of its existing arsenal, which cannot be immediately replaced. Fortunately for the Ukrainians, they do have a supplement of other effective light infantry anti-armor weapons and have become experienced in making every shot count. For the time being, though, the Javelin has acquired so literarily iconic a place in the Ukrainian arsenal that reports have come in of a local artist creating a piece of mock traditional religious art depicting Mary Magdalene holding a Javelin. Newborn Ukrainian babies have reportedly been christened “Javelin” or “Javelina.”",World/Air Force Times,"Javelin missile: Made by the US, wielded by Ukraine, feared by Russia",https://news.yahoo.com/javelin-missile-made-us-wielded-185955874.html
5/13/2022,"STORY: Every Thursday, a small group of protesters gather outside Japan's newest army base to demand its closure. This patch of land, on the tiny island of Miyako, in the country's south, was once a golf course. Now, it's equipped with missile launchers which are meant to target Chinese ships sailing in and out of the Western Pacific. The island is one of the Okinawa islands and sits less than 250 miles from Taiwan and 125 miles from uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, It's considered a vital military outpost but some locals fear it could become a target for China. ""These are small islands. Building up a military base will not protect them, but rather make them a target of attacks as I explained earlier. So I don't think this (deploying troops here) will lead to peace."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine has added to those concerns, with Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning of the fragility of security in Asia. Japan is set to revise its national security strategy this year and that could mean committing more money to defence including missiles that can hit targets on foreign soil. China, which spends almost five times as much on defence as Japan, says it intentions in the region are peaceful. Still - the island's base commander, Colonel Masakazu Iyota, is calling for more reinforcements. There's also pressure on Okinawa to let military planes use an airport on Shimoji island. ""I don't think our current set up is enough. Going forward, the details will be laid out according to the government's defence build-up plan."" On Sunday, Miyako and the rest of Okinawa mark 50 years since the United States ended its occupation, a pivotal moment in its return to normality after World War Two.

(AP) — A Connecticut state trooper who is a native of Poland got quite the surprise while responding to an SUV with a flat tire Wednesday — a passenger in the vehicle happened to be former Polish President Lech Walesa. State police said Trooper Lukasz Lipert arrived to the call in Tolland and was greeted by Walesa, who had spoken in Hartford on Tuesday as part of his U.S. tour advocating for aid for refugees who have fled Ukraine during the war with Russia. Lipert, 35, who came to the U.S. when he was 18, told The Hartford Courant that he spoke with Walesa in Polish about their homeland and the anti-communist movement Walesa helped lead. “It was definitely a great opportunity to meet the man who had a voice during those times,” Lipert said. “It was definitely a great experience."" Walesa, 78, led the nationwide Solidarity movement in Poland in the 1980s that eventually toppled Poland's communist leaders through an election in 1989. He received a Nobel Prize in 1983 and served as Poland's first popularly elected president from 1990 to 1995. He is a strong critic of Poland's current right-wing government.

5/13/2022,"The national average gas price for regular unleaded at nearly $4.42 per gallon today — well over $1 more than this time last year, according to gasprices.aaa.com. This week alone, since Monday, May 9, 2022, the price rose by 9 cents. This is in spite of decreased demand which would, typically, lower prices at the pump. POLL: Have Gas Prices Affected Your Driving Habits?
Live Blog: Elon Musk, Inflation, Crypto Crash, SNAP/Food Stamps, Social Security and More In spite of the market volatility and climbing prices, President Joe Biden announced on Thursday, May 12, that his administration is canceling the Alaskan Oil & Gas Lease, according to a report from CBSNews.com. The lease would have given companies the opportunity to drill for oil in Cook Inlet, Alaska, an area spanning 1 million acres. In a statement to CBS News, the Department of the Interior said that there was a “lack of industry interest in leasing in the area.” To auction off-shore leases, the Department of Interior must follow a five-year plan, CBS News reported. The current plan was set to expire at the end of May, and there had been no interest in leasing the land. Since the land was not currently being leased, the decision does not reduce the amount of crude oil available; it only reduces the potential to mine for oil in the region. However, Frank Macchairola of the American Petroleum Institute called the decision “another example of the administration’s lack of commitment to oil and gas development in the U.S.” He told CBS News, “In the kind of price environment that we’re seeing, there are negative consequences to shutting off oil and gas development, both politically and practically.” However, the decision does support Biden’s commitment to environmental sustainability, as outlined in his Federal Sustainability Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. to 50% of 2005 levels by 2030. Leasing the Cook Inlet could have led to the creation of new underwater pipelines and offshore drilling across 1 million acres for more than 40 years. While access to this source of oil may have helped mitigate rising gas prices, it would not have provided immediate relief. Plus, it cuts off one potential avenue to reducing the U.S. dependency on foreign oil. On the heels of the announcement, the Department of the Interior pointed out that, of the 10.9 million acres of offshore federal waters already under lease, only 25% are being used to produce oil, the New York Post reported. Republicans in Congress openly tweeted their disagreement with the Biden administration’s decision. “Gas prices are at a record high, and Biden just canceled oil and gas leases in Alaska and the Gulf,” tweeted Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). The decision may drive gas prices even higher, but a number of other factors — including increased demand sparked by the upcoming Memorial Day holiday weekend — may also play a role.

For now, the best course of action for U.S. drivers is to use an app to shop around for lower prices, be mindful that gas stations in specific locations may cost more, pay cash to take advantage of lower pricing, and top off when you see prices drop so you are never stuck with a tank close to “E” when gas prices are trending upward.

In a resignation letter, Lee, a Republican, said she would step down Monday and thanked the governor, who appointed her in 2019. Her letter did not specify a reason for leaving but news outlets have reported that she is considering a run for Congress.
