5/16/2022,"The Coalition has conceded its plan to allow first homebuyers access to superannuation will push up prices, as industry super and progressive thinktanks warned it could add tens of thousands to the cost of a home. The policy, unveiled at the Coalition launch on Sunday, to allow first homebuyers access to up to $50,000 of retirement savings has prompted warnings that house prices in Sydney could increase by as much as $134,000. The scheme has already been rubbished by Labor and the former prime minister Paul Keating, the architect of Australia’s compulsory super system, setting up a major policy fight in the last week of the federal election campaign. Scott Morrison defended the policy in a round of interviews on Monday morning, arguing it would help first homebuyers get off “the sidelines where they see house prices go up” but would not hurt their super balances because the investment in the home would go back in after it was sold. But the superannuation minister, Jane Hume, told Radio National there would likely be “a bump in house prices” in the short term, as “a lot of people bring forward their decision to buy a house”. Under the policy homebuyers at any income level will be able to access 40% of their super, up to a maximum of $50,000, to buy a property that must be owner-occupied, provided they have already saved a 5% deposit. In January the McKell Institute modelled the impact of allowing prospective homebuyers access to superannuation in conjunction with researchers from the Centre for Housing, Urban and Regional Planning at the University of South Australia. They found allowing access to $40,000 from super would encourage the take-up of $73.6bn in new housing debt as renters entered the market to buy, causing a one-off price surge in the first year of the policy. The biggest price impact would be in Brisbane, where the median house price was estimated to rise $99,346, followed by Hobart ($92,796), Adelaide ($84,534), Perth ($57,413) and Sydney ($45,342). The report also concluded that “given the historical stronger performance of super compared to real housing market returns, the effect of compounding over a long time period (30 years) means that individuals accessing super for housing are likely to end up financially worse off in the end”. Industry Super Australia estimated the effect could be even larger, basing its predictions on a model of pent-up demand for homes and the observed take-up of the previous early super release scheme during the pandemic. It found that allowing couples to take up to $40,000 from super could push prices in Sydney up by 16%, adding $134,000 to the median price; Perth by 14%, adding $60,000; Darwin by 10%, adding $45,000; and Melbourne by 9%, adding $55,000. The ISA chief executive, Bernie Dean, said: “Throwing super into the housing market would be like throwing petrol on a bonfire – it will jack up prices, inflate young people’s mortgages and add to the aged pension, which taxpayers will have to pay for.” The McKell Institute’s executive director, Michael Buckland, said the data showed the policy amounted to a further intergenerational transfer of wealth from young people to existing, older homeowners. “What first homebuyers desperately need is a little calm in the overheated housing market,” he said. “This proposal would kickstart yet another house price spiral, stripping young people of their super savings and doing virtually nothing to improve real affordability.” On Monday Morrison told ABC Brisbane the government is aiming to “minimise” any potential price impact with supply-side policies aimed to encourage older Australians to downsize house and limits on how much super can be withdrawn. Earlier, Morrison told Channel Seven’s Sunrise the policy would “absolutely not” run down workers’ super, and they “may well have more” retirement savings because the initial investment and a portion for any capital gain “goes back into their super” if they sell. The prime minister accused Labor of opposing the policy because “they don’t treat super like it is your money”. “It’s your money, you earned it and saved it … and we want to help you get into your own home without impacting on your long-term superannuation.” On Sunday the assistant treasurer, Michael Sukkar, argued the policy was “calibrated at a level that’s not going to have a material impact, but it will help people buy their first home”. Asked if prices would surge, Sukkar told Sky News: “No, not in a material way because when you look at the size of the Australian housing market – $9.9tn – you look at the number of first-homebuyers there are a year and there are about 100,000, about a third of all new homes or less than a third of all new homes.”",News/Australia news,Coalition plan to allow first homebuyers to access super ‘will jack up house prices’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/16/coalition-plan-to-allow-first-homebuyers-to-access-super-will-jack-up-house-prices

5/16/2022,"Andreas Christensen limited Chelsea’s defensive options in the FA Cup final by making himself unavailable for selection on the day of the game. Christensen, who is poised to join Barcelona on a free transfer at the end of the season, was a surprise absentee from the squad that lost on penalties against Liverpool at Wembley on Saturday. He was not carrying an injury and told Thomas Tuchel of his decision on Saturday morning. It is understood that he had not been feeling well during the week and informed Chelsea’s head coach that he was not ready to play. Christensen had managed to start Chelsea’s win against Leeds last Wednesday. Tuchel made no mention of the centre-back being injured before or after the Liverpool game. Christensen’s teammates were said to be shocked and confused when the Denmark international left the team hotel. It is unclear if Christensen was going to start against Liverpool, though sources suggested he was going to be a substitute. But if he had not started the final he would have been a candidate to come off the bench at Wembley after Thiago Silva sustained an early injury. Silva soldiered on and finished the game but the 37‑year‑old was walking with a heavy limp as he exited Wembley. Tuchel will have a chance to talk about Christensen before Chelsea, whose defence will be weakened further when Antonio Rüdiger joins Real Madrid, face Leicester on Thursday. Last week, though, the club’s head coach admitted the Dane’s decision to join Barça has affected his form. Christensen was substituted at half-time during Chelsea’s defeats by Real Madrid and Arsenal last month, and he has been in an awkward position after talks over a contract extension hit a dead end earlier this season. Chelsea twice had verbal agreements with Christensen for a new deal, only for the defender to change his mind on both occasions. The player later hired new representatives, who wanted to start negotiations from scratch. Chelsea’s board took a different view. The situation has not gone down well at Stamford Bridge. But there is no bitterness towards Rüdiger, even though the Germany centre-back is also leaving on a free. The feeling is that Rüdiger, who has agreed a four-year deal with Madrid, has not messed Chelsea around. He had another fine game against Liverpool. Rüdiger made it clear after the Wembley defeat that the sanctions imposed on Roman Abramovich had nothing to do with his decision to move to the Bernabéu. Chelsea offered the 29-year-old player, who earns around £90,000 a week, £230,000 a week to stay and would have made him the highest paid defender in the club’s history. But the negotiations broke down when Chelsea received a request for a signing‑on bonus and large fees for the player’s representatives. Talks could not resume after Abramovich was hit with sanctions. Yet Rüdiger suggested Chelsea had a chance of keeping him. “I don’t want to go too deep into things,” he said. “There was a chance. But sanctions is not the reason.” Losing Rüdiger and Christensen is a huge blow. Chelsea, who could also allow César Azpilicueta to join Barcelona, may need to bring in two centre-backs this summer. They have looked at Sevilla’s Jules Koundé, Atlético Madrid’s José María Giménez, Leicester’s Wesley Fofana and RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol. Strengthening the defence will be a major priority for Todd Boehly once his consortium has bought the club from Abramovich. Tuchel met Boehly for the first time last Thursday but is yet to talk to the American about transfers. “We had lunch together but it was in the room where everybody was, like players and staff,” Tuchel said. “He was very friendly, very open and it was a very informal meeting over lunch. It was like half an hour, 40 minutes, so it was not too detailed. It was just to get a feeling and say hello, and we talked more about baseball and basketball actually. It was not the moment. We will do this in the next weeks.” Chelsea must make decisions over Jorginho and N’Golo Kanté, with both midfielders out of contract next year, while there are doubts over Romelu Lukaku’s future. Tuchel admitted that it will be difficult for Chelsea to catch up with Liverpool and Manchester City this summer. “It’s maybe impossible, I have to say,” he said. “They are improving their squad in every transfer window. It seems like we are losing key players. We are losing Toni, we’re losing Andreas. This is tough and we already have a gap to close.” Tuchel defended Mason Mount after the midfielder missed the decisive penalty in the shootout. “The penalty will change nothing on my opinion about Mason. He is a key figure in this squad. He is a super nice guy and we don’t start doubting now because he misses a penalty.”",Sport/Football,Andreas Christensen made himself unavailable for Chelsea at FA Cup final ,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/andreas-christensen-made-himself-unavailable-for-chelsea-at-fa-cup-final
5/16/2022,"Trent Alexander-Arnold has said his appetite for silverware has only increased after becoming the youngest player to win all six major trophies available to an English club. Liverpool’s FA Cup victory on Saturday ensured that, at the age of 23 years and 219 days, Alexander-Arnold has won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup, League Cup, Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup. Alexander-Arnold is the sixth player to complete that sextuple after Ryan Giggs, Denis Irwin, James Milner, César Azpilicueta and Andreas Christensen. Only Cristiano Ronaldo, when aged 23 years and 109 days, won the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup at a younger age than Liverpool’s gifted right-back. “It feels special,” said Alexander-Arnold, who made his first-team debut less than six years ago. “Growing up you never think you will win all these trophies. You see legendary players who do that and you think it is unbelievable. To be able to say I have done that at such a young age is a dream come true and it is motivation to go on and carry on winning more trophies. “Hopefully there is a lot more to come. The motivation is to win them all again and keep winning and keep adding to the trophy cabinet. “Days like Saturday help me. I think it comes from within and thinking about what I want my legacy to be and where I think my potential is as a player. The sky is the limit really, so I want to push on and never be satisfied. I will keep my head down, try and win more trophies and hopefully at the end of my career I can be proud of what I have done.” The FA Cup triumph against Chelsea also completed the set for Jürgen Klopp, who became the first manager in Liverpool’s rich history to win the European Cup, league title, FA Cup and League Cup. Liverpool could yet add the Premier League and Champions League to this season’s trophy haul and Alexander-Arnold credited a fellow member of the sextuple club, Milner, with maintaining high standards inside the dressing room. “He is someone who keeps us all on our toes, he is massive in that dressing room,” Alexander-Arnold said of the 36-year-old, who is out of contract this summer but has been offered a one-year extension by Liverpool. “He is one of the biggest characters I have been around and it is credit to him. “It is no surprise he has carried on winning everywhere he goes because he is relentless in what he does. He instils that mentality in us and he embodies that. Five years ago if anyone had told me I would achieve what I have achieved I don’t know what I would have said. It is very special and, hopefully, in five more years I am in an even better place than I am now. It has not gone too bad so far. Five or 10 years’ time and we will hopefully be talking about bigger and better things.” Liverpool have won three consecutive finals against Chelsea on penalty shootouts and with a different goalkeeper in each one – Alisson in the FA Cup, Caoimhin Kelleher in the Carabao Cup and Adrián in the 2019 Super Cup. “Three different goalkeepers, three times winners. I said that in the changing room,” the goalkeeping coach, John Achterberg, said. “That is what you want. You need a little bit of luck as well as hard work. It makes all our day.” Achterberg described Alisson’s performance at Wembley as “outstanding, awesome”. Klopp dedicated the trophy to neuro11, the company which has worked with Liverpool for the past year on penalty technique, but the goalkeeping coach insists ultimate responsibility for the team’s spot-kick success remains with the players. “We work on things but in the end Ali makes the final decision,” Achterberg said. “We discuss everything. They have all been practising a lot on penalties this season. Obviously the guys from Germany came to work with them specifically, but more and more players have been practising after training and getting confidence. It is a big credit to them all because it is big pressure to take one. You win as a team. We analyse all these things and there is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes.”",Sport/Football,Alexander-Arnold hungry for more Liverpool silverware after historic feat,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/alexander-arnold-hungry-for-more-liverpool-silverware-after-historic-feat
5/16/2022,"Mikel Arteta denies trying to manufacture a “them against us” culture inside the Arsenal dressing room as they look to secure the two wins that would guarantee a return to Champions League football, and claims he offered no complaints about the refereeing calls made during Thursday’s damaging derby defeat to Spurs. Arsenal’s result at Newcastle on Monday night will determine whether they enter the final day of the season with their fate in their own hands. A win will mean three points against Everton secure a place among the elite; anything else will hand Spurs a similar advantage when they travel to Norwich. Arteta was seething after the 3-0 north London derby loss, making perfectly clear his belief Paul Tierney’s first-half decisions to award Tottenham a penalty and dismiss Rob Holding were incorrect and had cost Arsenal the game; it seemed an attempt to foster a bunker mentality, at least to some extent, but he claims excuses are not his style. “What I have tried to do in [two and a half] years here is not make any complaints,” he said. “I have no complaint and I didn’t complain on Thursday. I just said I could not give a clear assessment on what I thought about the game, and that’s it.” In reality Arteta’s post-match comments at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – “If I say what I think I am suspended for six months” – said more than enough and there is a sense in some quarters that Arsenal are at times too happy to linger on perceived injustices. “Whatever we do, we will try to defend the club in the right way, like we have always tried to do,” he said. “The other night I tried to do it as well … I was being clear and honest. I think that is my job and my responsibility, when I talk on behalf of the club, to express how we feel. And if I cannot do it, I prefer not to.” Arsenal will wait nervously on the fitness of their first-choice centre-backs, Ben White and Gabriel Magalhães. White seems likely to start after making the bench at Spurs, having recovered from a hamstring problem; Gabriel hobbled off late on and his involvement will be a late call. Europa League football is at least guaranteed for next season and, after a year away from continental competition, fifth place would still constitute good progress for Arteta’s side. However, he would not countenance celebrating such an outcome. “No, we want to be playing in the Champions League,” he said. “We’ve come so far, it’s in our hands and we want to now capitalise on that, and the excitement and the opportunities there. We will really want to go for it.”",Sport/Football,Mikel Arteta denies creating ‘them against us’ culture at Arsenal,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/15/mikel-arteta-denies-creating-them-against-us-culture-at-arsenal
