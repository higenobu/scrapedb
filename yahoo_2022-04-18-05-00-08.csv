4/18/2022,"A California man died after he got pinned between his vehicle and the machinery at an automatic car wash, police say. Officers with the Escondido Police Department responded “late in the evening” Friday, April 15, to a car wash on the city’s east side, and found a 56-year-old man “trapped between a 2014 Scion XB and a part of the car wash machinery,” a police release said. Investigators believe that, shortly after the man drove into the car wash, he got out of his vehicle and it rolled forward, trapping him against the machines. Police don’t know why he exited the vehicle. The car wash was not running at the time of the accident, according to the release. An alarm began sounding from the car wash and may have been going off for up to half an hour before another person found the man, police told TV station KSWB. First responders lifted the vehicle off of the man and he was transported to a hospital, where he died, outlets reported. Police did not release the man’s name. 2 dead after driver tried to beat packed Amtrak train at rail crossing, Texas cops say Man gets out of SUV to confront teens, then it rolled and killed one, Texas cops say Prius gets ‘fried’ by lightning bolt during storm, Iowa video shows Man killed in fiery crash after 18-wheeler has blowout and hits sedan, Texas cops say",U.S./Fresno Bee,"Man dies at car wash after getting stuck between his vehicle and machinery, CA cops say",https://news.yahoo.com/man-dies-car-wash-getting-185533913.html
4/18/2022,"STORY: A deadline for Ukrainian troops holed-up in Mariupol to lay down their arms came and went on Sunday (April 17). Russia issued the ultimatum for the out-numbered soldiers who have been defending the smoldering Azovstal steelworks. But several hours after the deadline, in the early hours of the morning, and there was no sign of surrender. Azovstal - one of Europe's largest metallurgical plants - has become a last stand for the defending forces. Moscow says its solders have cleared the urban area of Mariupol and are almost completely in control. Having failed to overcome Ukrainian resistance in the north, the Russian military is now focused on Donbas. Capturing the eastern region's main port city would be a major strategic prize for Russia - connecting territory it holds in Donbas with the Crimea region it annexed in 2014. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said his government was in contact with the troops at Azovstal. Speaking on Saturday (April 16) he accused Russia of trying to ""destroy everyone"" in Mariupol and said killing the soldiers would put paid to peace efforts. It's unclear how many soldiers are inside the steelworks. Satellite images have shown smoke and fire coming from the area, which is riddled with tunnels underneath. Meanwhile Russia continued with long-range attacks on other locations in Ukraine, all part of what it calls a special military operation. Local media reported an explosion in Kyiv, though the capital's deputy mayor said air defense systems had thwarted Russian attacks. The mayor of the nearby city Brovary said a missile attack had damaged infrastructure. According to the RIA news agency, Russia said it had destroyed an ammunition factory near the capital.",Politics/Reuters Videos,Mariupol defenders resist Russian ultimatum,https://news.yahoo.com/mariupol-defenders-resist-russian-ultimatum-150825209.html
