2/8/2022,"Matt Kelley and his group of hunters in Alabama were hoisting what they thought was an 8-point buck they had killed up onto the skinning rack when they noticed that something was missing. The deer had a full rack of solid antlers but no male reproductive parts. Instead, it appeared to be a doe, the Alabama Department of Conservation said in a report. Little did Kelley’s group first know, they had hunted one of the most unusual deer that the state experts had encountered. According to Chris Cook, the coordinator for the Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division’s Deer Program, he was familiar with several deer similar to the one that Kelley’s had brought in, but none with a solid head of antlers. “I’ve seen a few over the years that looked like does externally that had antlers,” Cook said in the department report. “But it’s not physically possible to do that and be fully functional does. I’ll get reports about a few each year in Alabama. The ones I usually hear about are the ones with fully developed antlers but are still covered in velvet. They have enough testosterone to start the antler growth but not enough to complete the cycle.” Kelley and his group took back five bucks from their hunting session, they told officials. The first time they noticed that something was off about the unusual deer was when one hunter commented on how skinny its neck was. “Then the guy who shot it was starting to skin it and said, ‘Boys, this is a doe,’” Kelley told officials. “What was more crazy was the guy who shot it said the deer was actually not chasing a doe but walking behind it,” Kelley said. “The doe urinated and this deer lip-curled just like a buck would. The landowner has had this land all his life, and they’ve never killed one like it his whole life. It’s a significant rack for a buck. If you looked at it, you would say this one was a shooter.” The deer isn’t completely a doe, though, according to Cook. It’s not a buck either. It’s a natural phenomenon called a pseudohermaphrodite. “A deer like this with hardened antlers will have testes inside the body cavity,” Cook said in the report. “They don’t have fully developed male or female organs. They may have external female organs, but they would have to have underdeveloped testes that were still large enough to produce enough testosterone to have that antler growth.” According to Cook, true does with functioning reproductive organs and antlers make up roughly 0.1% of the deer population. Kelley and the rest of the hunting group were on a fundraising hunt for Kelley’s religious organization Equip Ministry, which aims to help combat substance abuse in the community. The organization posted a livestream with Kelley and the hunting group the evening that they brought in the pseudohermaphrodite deer. Kelley told the Alabama Department of Conservation that the special deer weighed 175 pounds and had eight points, including two kickers on the base of one of the antlers. It was taken in Sumter County across the Tombigbee River Marengo County, near the Mississippi border and about 130 miles west of Montgomery.

2/8/2022,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin described Monday's talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in the Kremlin as useful, substantive and business-like, and said that some of Macron's ideas could form a basis for further joint steps. The French leader travelled to Moscow for talks amid an East-West standoff over a Russian military buildup near Ukraine and a Kremlin campaign for security ""guarantees"" from Washington that would include a halt to NATO expansion. In a joint news conference after the talks, Putin said that a number of Macron's ideas concerning security were realistic and that the two would talk again once Macron had travelled to Kyiv to meet Ukraine's leadership. ""A number of his ideas, proposals, which are probably still too early to talk about, I think it is quite possible to make the basis of our further joint steps,"" he said. ""We have agreed that after his trip to the Ukrainian capital we will call each other again and exchange views on this matter,"" he said. Russia has built up more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine, stirring fears that Moscow may be planning to invade. Russia has dismissed those fears.

2/8/2022,"The snake catcher Vava Suresh was discharged from the hospital, according to the news outlet Onmanorama. A video of Suresh being bit by a venomous snake on January 31 circulated online. Suresh is popular on the internet, with many followers across YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram. The snake catcher and social media star Vava Suresh was discharged Monday from an Indian hospital a week after he was bit by a venomous snake, according to the Indian outlet Onmanorama. Suresh left the Kottayam Medical College Hospital in Kottayam, India around 11 a.m. in good condition, Onmanorama reported. A cobra snake had bitten him a week earlier on January 31 while he was trying to pick it up, according to the outlet. A video of the moment was shared online by the outlet Indian Express. In the 21 second clip, Suresh can be seen holding a wriggling snake and trying to place it in a large bag. After a few seconds, the snake appeared to latch onto his leg as onlookers cried out and fled after he dropped the cobra on the ground. A single bite from a cobra contains enough venom to kill as many as 20 people, according to a report from Newsweek. Suresh, who went into cardiac arrest after the snake bite, was transported to the hospital and regained consciousness on Thursday after he spent several days in an Intensive Care Unit and on a ventilator, Onmanorama reported. He was treated with 65 bottles of anti-venom, Onmanorama reported. According to the outlet, 25 bottles of the anti-venom are typically used, but Suresh required the higher dosage to combat the effects of the bite. Suresh is widely known across the internet. He has over 500,000 subscribers and 51 million views on YouTube, where he has posted numerous videos showing him catching snakes. He also has 2 million Facebook followers and almost 75,000 on Instagram. The outlet India Today called Suresh the ""Steve Irwin"" of Kerala, India, a reference to the late Irwin's reputation as a fearless crocodile hunter. Suresh first caught a snake when he was 12 years old, and has captured over 30,000 snakes over the years, according to India Today. Suresh did not respond to a request for comment.

2/8/2022,"Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie did not hold back Sunday in his criticism of how former President Donald Trump has sought to depict the deadly attack against the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. ""Let's face it. Let's call it what it is. Jan. 6 was a riot that was incited by Donald Trump in an effort to intimidate Mike Pence and the Congress into doing exactly what he said in his own words last week: Overturn the election,"" Christie said on ABC's ""This Week."" Christie, a former GOP presidential candidate, made the comment in reaction to the back-and-forth between Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence. Trump incorrectly claims that Pence had the power to reverse the 2020 presidential contest, and the former president put his falsehoods in blunt terms in a statement last week. ""Unfortunately, he didn’t exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!"" Trump exclaimed. Christie said Sunday that Trump's statement let the truth slip: Trump lost the election to now-President Biden and was trying to cling to power. ""He actually told the truth by accident,"" the ex-governor said. ""He wanted the election to be overturned."" Trump's effort to get Pence to unconstitutionally change the election culminated on Jan. 6, 2021, the day of Congress's certification of Biden's Electoral College win. Pence, as vice president, held the mostly ceremonial position of president of the Senate, and presided over the certification. ""Unfortunately, the president had many bad advisers who were basically snake-oil salesmen giving him really random and novel ideas as to what the vice president could do,"" Marc Short, Pence's former chief of staff, recalled Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Trump, who has spun a web of false conspiracy theories alleging widespread voter fraud, headlined the ""Stop the Steal"" rally in Washington on the day of the attack, where he urged his supporters to ""fight."" A mob of those supporters then assaulted the Capitol, with some of them even chanting, ""Hang Mike Pence."" More than 100 police officers were injured, and five people died in connection to the riot. More than 700 people have been arrested by authorities and charged with federal crimes related to the assault. At a recent campaign rally, Trump floated the idea of pardoning some of the Jan. 6 rioters, drawing more attention to his actions that day, which ultimately led to his second impeachment. Rebutting Trump last week, Pence defended his own actions that day. “President Trump is wrong,” Pence said in a speech. “I had no right to overturn the election.” Trump, in turn, has kept his fire on Pence. ""I was right and everyone knows it,"" he said in a statement blasting Pence’s defense. Christie, a former Trump ally and a former federal prosecutor, has had harsh words for Trump's conduct on Jan. 6, previously saying the rioters were ""driven from the top"" by Trump's rhetoric. On Sunday, Christie backed Pence in the dispute over the election certification. ""I think that the action the vice president took on Jan. 6 spoke loudly, and I'm glad he's finally put words to it. I don't know why it took him so long, but I'm glad that he did,"" Christie said. ""Donald Trump did respond to what the vice president said, and I think it's kind of akin to a kid standing in the corner holding his breath,"" Christie added. ""It's immature, and it's beneath the office that he held.""",Politics/Yahoo News,Chris Christie rips Trump's Jan. 6 claims: 'He actually told the truth by accident',https://news.yahoo.com/chris-christie-trump-pence-jan-6-152703059.html
2/8/2022,"PALM BEACH, Fla. – A woman fell to her death Sunday afternoon from a rising drawbridge that began opening before she could move off it, police said. West Palm Beach police said the woman was walking off the bridge with a bicycle and was within 10 feet of the barrier arms that halt traffic when the drawbridge started to rise, sending her careening into an open chasm. A man standing on the other side of the barrier arms grabbed her as she fell but could not hold on, police said. She plummeted more than 50 feet. “She was walking her bike from east to west and had almost reached the furthest point of the moveable span when it went up,” police spokesman Mike Jachles said. “He tried to help her, but he wasn’t able to hold onto her and she fell about five to six stories below.” Video: Driver in Florida jumps opening drawbridge in intense video Detectives are investigating why the drawbridge rose before all pedestrians had a chance to clear it. The accident happened shortly after 1 p.m. The bridge was closed for nearly six hours as rescue workers recovered the woman’s body and detectives and crime scene investigators inspected the scene. Police declined to identify the woman Sunday. Police described the bridge tender as “distraught” when officers and rescue workers were on the scene. The tender’s actions before the bridge opened will be a focus of the investigation, Jachles said. The bridge is maintained by the state Department of Transportation, but it's tended by staff from a private state contractor, he said.

You cannot even hold a candle to an amateur!” The Western Journal reported the hashtag was censored and later disappeared. A distraught Yi said she was ""upset and a little embarrassed"" after leaving the race. “I guess I felt a lot of pressure because I know everybody in China was pretty surprised with the selection for ladies’ singles, and I just really wanted to show them what I was able to do, but unfortunately I didn’t,” she said, according to the Western Journal.

2/8/2022,"ALLEGAN, Mich. (AP) — A man serving life sentences in Virginia for raping and killing a woman in 1980 was sentenced Monday to an additional 35 to 50 years in prison in Michigan for the 1989 killing of his 14-year-old daughter. Dennis Bowman pleaded no contest to second-degree murder in December for the killing of his daughter Aundria Bowman, whose body was found two years ago buried in his backyard in Hamilton, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) southwest of Grand Rapids. A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is treated as such for the purpose of sentencing. “His numerous assaults, his behavior in this case, other convictions all indicate Mr. Bowman is a serious, dangerous man that has harmed many communities, many families,"" Allegan County Circuit Court Judge Margaret Zuzich Bakker said during Monday’s sentencing, which Bowman attended in-person. ""It’s impossible to even articulate the words to describe what he has done. Reading what he has done is sickening.” Aundria Bowman was last seen in March 1989. Her body was discovered in February 2020 under a concrete slab in the backyard of Bowman’s Hamilton home after he confessed to her killing. Bowman told police he pushed the teen down stairs, killing her, after she threatened to report that he had molested her. He called police that day to report that his daughter had stolen $100 from him and his wife, and had run away from home. Bowman told police that he used an axe to cut off Aundria's legs so that her body would fit in a barrel. He said he buried the barrel at the family's Holland-area home at the time and then reburied it at their new home in Hamilton after they moved. Bowman is serving two life sentences for the 1980 rape and murder of Kathleen Doyle in Norfolk, Virginia. She was the 25-year-old wife of a U.S. Navy pilot when she was killed. Authorities said forensic evidence led to Bowman’s November 2019 arrest in that case, and that after his arrest, he confessed to killing Aundria, whom he and his wife had adopted. Aundria's biological mother, Cathy Terkanian, told reporters after Monday's hearing that she is seeking custody of Aundria's remains. “This is just so surreal. I spent 10 years trying to see that happen,” Terkanian said.",U.S./Associated Press,Virginia inmate sentenced in Michigan for daughter's killing,https://news.yahoo.com/virginia-inmate-sentenced-michigan-daughters-162617275.html
2/8/2022,"Drew Angerer/Getty Omarosa Manigault Newman On the heels of renewed news reports that former President Donald Trump was known to rip up important documents during his time in the White House, one ex-staffer says she isn't surprised by the behavior at all. ""He loved to tear up those documents,"" Omarosa Manigault Newman, the 48-year-old former Apprentice star and Trump aide-turned-Trump enemy, said in an interview on MSNBC on Monday. ""We got a very big briefing about presidential records and management ... we had been told that if you're with the president and he hands you something ... you have to account for that,"" Newman said. She continued: ""His habit of tearing these things up ... my heart truly goes out to the people responsible for going in the trash bins [and] recovering these things. But there are certainly things that I'm sure cannot be accounted for because Donald Trump became very very aware that a lot of these sensitive documents would at some point be made public."" She also claimed that she once saw Trump, 75, ""chewing"" a document he had just torn up after meeting with his former attorney Michael Cohen in the Oval Office. ""After [Trump attorney] Michael Cohen left the office and I walked in to the Oval, Donald — in my view — was chewing what he had just torn up,"" she said on MSNBC, later adding, ""It was very bizarre because he is a germophobe he never puts paper in his mouth."" That incident, she said, ""makes me worry that there are a lot of documents that may not be accounted for, that there may be documents that can tell the full story about what happened on the days leading up to January 6th for instance, that we may never see or may never come to light,"" she added. Like her former boss, Newman has a history of headline-making — and sometimes disputed — statements and she has regularly feuded with Trump since she was fired from the White House in late 2017. Her tell-all about her work with the administration described Trump as in ""mental decline"" and as a racist and misogynist. His spokeswoman said the book was full of ""lies"" and ""false attacks"" from a ""disgruntled former White House employee."" RELATED: Jan. 6 Committee Requests Voluntary Interview with Ivanka Trump: 'You Were in the Oval Office' Spencer Platt/Getty  Donald Trump Last week, the National Archives confirmed that some of the files it had received from Trump's time in office ""included paper records that had been torn up by former President Trump."" Some of those ripped-up and reconstructed documents were reportedly among the more than 700 pages turned over to lawmakers investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riots, The Washington Post reported. (The Jan. 6 committee did not respond to PEOPLE's request for a comment; neither did a Trump spokeswoman.) Trump had fought to keep the bipartisan House of Representatives committee from reviewing the documents as part of their investigation into the deadly rioting last year, but the Supreme Court rejected the former president's request to keep the records. Trump has a longstanding habit of destroying files, per Politico, which reported in 2018 that he preferred to tear them up once finished with them — a problem after he took office. Government employees were required to reconstruct the files, in keeping with the law. ""I had a letter from [Sen. Chuck] Schumer — he tore it up,"" one official told Politico. ""It was the craziest thing ever. He ripped papers into tiny pieces."" RELATED: Trump Had a Habit of Ripping Up Presidential Documents — Like Those Sent to Jan. 6 Investigators In 2004, Newman rose to fame as reality TV villain on season 1 of The Apprentice — where she was fired by Trump. But she remained in his orbit and joined his 2016 presidential campaign, where she was eventually hired as director of communications for the White House Office of Public Liaison before her infamous ousting in 2017. Shortly after Newman's tell-all was published, Trump's campaign filed arbitration saying that she had violated a 2016 confidentiality agreement, but a New York arbitrator ruled last year that the agreement was ""vague and unenforceable.""",Politics/People,Omarosa Says Trump Made a 'Habit' of Tearing Up White House Files — Including One 'Very Bizarre' Scene,https://news.yahoo.com/omarosa-says-trump-made-habit-200746193.html
