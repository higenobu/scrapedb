2/22/2022,"The UK government has recorded the first monthly budget surplus since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, despite a weaker than expected January performance as rising inflation pushed up debt interest costs. The Office for National Statistics said public sector net borrowing was in surplus of £2.9bn last month – the first month in which income outstripped expenditure since January 2020.  January is typically a net positive month for the public finances because of the timing of self-assessed income tax payments. Borrowing last month was £5.4bn less than in January 2021, when the third national lockdown affected the UK economy. Despite the return to the black, the surplus was still smaller than that recorded in January 2020 before the onset of Covid-19. City economists had also forecast a bigger boost for the public finances of £3.5bn. The figures come as rising inflation pushes up the government’s debt servicing costs, fuelled by a surge in the retail prices index to which index-linked gilts are pegged. The ONS said accrued interest payments on central government debt were £6.1bn in January, the highest for that month since records began in April 1997. Alongside rising inflationary pressure, the record rise in government borrowing during the pandemic has pushed up the stock of national debt to levels unseen since the early 1960s. The ONS said the national debt – the total amount owed by the state accumulated over the years – was £2.3tn, or about 94.9% of gross domestic product (GDP). Rishi Sunak said the rise in the national debt and higher rates of inflation were putting additional pressure on the public finances. “Keeping the public finances on a sustainable path is crucial so we can continue helping the British people when needed, without burdening future generations with high debt repayments,” he said. Economists said central government receipts were stronger than anticipated by the Office for Budget Responsibility, the Treasury’s tax and spending watchdog. Borrowing between April and January 2021 was £139bn, below the OBR’s year-to-date forecast of £156bn. Michal Stelmach, a senior economist at KPMG UK, said he expected the OBR would revise down its borrowing projection for the 2021-22 financial year by about £20bn, although much of that would be taken up by the government’s £9bn package of energy support measures. “The underlying picture for borrowing in January is better than today’s data suggest. About 20% of taxpayers have not submitted their self-assessment tax return on time this year, taking advantage of the extended window set by HMRC.”",News/Business,UK reports first budget surplus in Covid crisis despite rising inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/uk-budget-surplus-covid-crisis-inflation-interest-national-debt
2/22/2022,"A United Australia party candidate has deleted a tweet about his family link to former prime minister Joseph Lyons after requests for proof from Lyons’ relatives. The UAP candidate for Bendigo, Elijah Suares, tweeted earlier this month that “former UAP prime minister, Joseph Lyons, is my great-grandmother’s uncle”, before drawing a parallel between Lyons’ depression-era policies and the current pandemic response.  He has since told Guardian Australia that his connection to Lyons is through a step-relative. Clive Palmer’s UAP has consistently attempted to assert links to Lyons and the original United Australia party of the 1930s and 1940s, a strategy criticised by surviving family members and dismissed by experts as “ridiculous”. When contacted for proof of his claim, Suares said he was not “blood related” and that it was his step relative who had the connection to Lyons. “I am definitely not saying that I am related, but she is. It’s just a very amazing thing that she is in our family and claims to be related.” Lyons’ great-grandson David Austin said his family had searched a database of more than 11,000 known relatives of Lyons and found nothing confirming Suares’ was a relative. “I can say considering our exhaustive family tree, there is no record of this candidate,” Austin said, while emphasising he was not acting as a spokesperson for the whole family. After being alerted to the claim by the Guardian, Austin tweeted Suares asking for proof. “As a grandson of Joseph Lyons, could you please tell me who your great-grandmother is??” Suares said he attempted to contact the family after the concerns were raised on Tuesday. His tweet was subsequently deleted. Suares said he had no reason to doubt what he had been told about him about his family’s relation to Lyons. But he told the Guardian he deleted the tweet because he did not want to put Lyon’s family in a difficult position, similar to that they faced in 2019, when other UAP candidates claimed relation to Lyons. “Knowing what they’ve been through in 2019 is basically what I would not want to happen to them,” He said would happily work with them to understand where this fits into their family tree. He said he understood why the family had questions about his claim. “I’m happy that they questioned it because obviously it’s something I was unknown about until two weeks ago, when I posted it.” The UAP’s website continues to use Lyons’ picture and biography on its website, under a page titled: “Our history – United Australia party prime ministers.” Former prime ministers Robert Menzies and William Hughes are also included on the page. None of the trio have any link to the modern iteration of the UAP, registered in 2018, and the Australian Electoral Commission had told the ABC that there is no continuity of registration between the 1930s UAP and the current party. The UAP did not respond to requests for comment.

Lyons’ great-granddaughter Wendy Lacey told SBS News in 2019 that the family were “appalled” by the party’s strategy, saying there was no connection between the original UAP, considered the precursor to the modern Liberal party, and the new party. The UAP is embarking on a huge ad spend, estimated to have cost $31m so far across print, digital, radio and social media. Some of those ads have spruiked a connection to Lyons.",News/Australia news,United Australia candidate deletes tweet about family link to former PM Joseph Lyons,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/united-australia-candidate-deletes-tweet-about-family-link-to-former-pm-joseph-lyons
2/22/2022,"The offensive, we are told, will take many forms. The first sign may well be a cyber-attack knocking out the power grid and internet, jamming mobile phone networks. Well-funded paramilitaries within Ukraine’s borders will be encouraged to create as much disorder as possible. There will be a blitz of propaganda, misinformation and false-flag operations. And then – finally – the blood sacrifice: the trained young men and women prepared to lay down their bodies for greater Russia. Perhaps we all got a taste of how this might play out on a much smaller scale on Thursday night. As a distraught Kamila Valieva left the ice after a disastrous skate that would cost her a medal in the Olympic women’s competition, the first person to greet her was her coach, Eteri Tutberidze. “Why did you let it go?” she screeched at Valieva in disbelief. “Explain it to me. Why? Why did you stop fighting?”  For all the deep, voyeuristic discomfort of the exchange, Valieva’s treatment also felt jarringly at odds with the solidarity and belligerence that Russian officials had displayed for much of the past week as their gold medal hope was embroiled in a scandal over a failed doping test. How could Russia fight so vehemently for Valieva only to disown her so publicly after the event? But, of course, that was the difference. Before, Valieva was a potential gold medal for Russia, an asset worthy of state-level protection. Now she was nothing. The motherland thanks you for your sacrifice. But it has no further use for you. Next. And, of course, there will be a next. If history is any guide, then it is probably safe to assume we have seen the last of Valieva in Olympic competition. This is the fourth successive Winter Games in which none of the Russian figure skating team from the previous Olympics made it to the next. Such is the depth and Darwinist savagery of the country’s skating programme, the lust for fresh and unspoilt young talent, the cheapness of human dignity and health, that by the time of Milan 2026 there will already be more Valievas, more Anna Shcherbakovas, more Alexandra Trusovas. For her part Valieva remains perhaps the only blameless party here. It does not feel remotely controversial to point out that a 15-year-old girl taking part in an enormous state-run sporting programme might not necessarily enjoy complete autonomy over the substances going into her body, any more than a soldier gets to choose the city he invades. Indeed, it is probably more helpful to think of her as the sporting equivalent of the Russian men and women currently crouched behind the Ukrainian border in their thousands: young and fit, in the prime of life and yet utterly expendable, live meat waiting to be flung into somebody else’s war. As the world’s diplomats and geopolitical experts peer into the fog trying to divine Russia’s intentions, perhaps sport offers a handy paradigm for how the country has chosen to behave on the global stage. In many ways sport’s governing bodies have been grappling for years with what much of the wider world is only now encountering: the challenge of corralling and constraining a power that shows no inclination of playing by the same basic rules and norms as everyone else. From the Sochi Olympics to the 2018 football World Cup to the massive state-sponsored Olympic doping programme that Russia continues to insist never existed, sport is a useful prototype for the rules of engagement that the Putin regime is now so dramatically bringing to the battlefield. International organisations, whether Fifa or Wada or the International Olympic Committee, are only as strong as their weakest link. Inconvenient narratives and insubordinate individuals can simply be denied, dismissed, discredited: witness how the British journalists who first broke the story of Valieva’s positive test claim they have faced a barrage of abuse and even death threats online. And, ultimately, the ends will always justify the means. There are two ways, I suppose, of looking at all this. Perhaps the impotence and indecision of western powers in the face of Russian aggression is an indication that standing up to Putin’s gangster state is easier said than done. If Nato cannot agree on an effective way of curbing Putin, then is it really fair to expect as much of the IOC president, Thomas Bach, a 68-year-old former fencer? Yet by the same token sport is irredeemably part of the greater enterprise here, the little unpunished broken windows that have persuaded the Kremlin the whole compound is up for grabs. In another saner world it would be appropriate to ask whether any of this is still fit for purpose. Clearly figure skating has some deep-seated ethical issues to deal with here, from its exploitation of young women on the very brink of adolescence to its controversial judging system to its history of eating disorders. “With each gram of weight, a gram of laziness is added,” Tutberidze said in a 2021 interview, and one wonders if a more enlightened sport might have considered restraining her rather than revering her for years as a legend. All the mood music coming out of Beijing suggests the IOC will instead rattle the sabres for a few days and then do very little. By the time Valieva’s doping case is finally heard, the world will have moved on to other matters and so will Russia. After all, there are always new theatres, new frontiers: new wars to fight and new bodies to fight them with.",Sport/Sport,"First the IOC, now Nato: how Putin’s Russia refuses to play by the rules | Jonathan Liew",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/feb/22/ioc-nato-vladimir-putin-russia-winter-olympics-kamila-valieva
2/22/2022,"I turned 50 in November and am very much in love with my 59-year-old girlfriend of two years. We have no arguments or stress – outside of one issue. In the past eight months or so, our sex life has come to a complete halt. At least three times a week she suggests we have sex, but I cannot stay aroused for long. I may be overthinking things, lacking confidence or simply experiencing fear or anxiety that I didn’t before. (I am a little overweight, due to spending more time at home because of the pandemic.) At first, our sex was awesome; I could hold out for at least three of her orgasms. But then I began experiencing premature ejaculation and she began to have some problems too. Now that these are resolved, I am struggling maintain an erection. I thought the problem was physical, but I can masturbate for as long and as many times in a day as I want.  It could have something to do with routine preparation; I think I need more spontaneity. Announcing, then showering, waiting, getting into bed and learning the rules or limitations, are all adding up. I am struggling and I don’t want her to think I am not attracted to her. Relax. As a couple, you are suffering from a “hot potato syndrome” – so called because one person experiences symptoms, then as they are recovering the other starts having issues. The pattern can repeat endlessly. Have a physical and psychological checkup – premature ejaculation can be the result of a physiological and/or a psychological problem, or a side-effect of medication. It is important to rule out such possibilities or, if necessary, seek treatment. Regarding your aversion to planning – it is OK to express this. Have a proper talk about everything: no blame, no shame, just affirming what is good and what could make it even better.
