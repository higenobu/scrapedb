12/11/2021,"The parents of a 15-year-old autistic girl who died by suicide after her school did not monitor her online activity have described the circumstances of her death as a “catastrophic failure” as they warned the Department for Education (DfE) against complacency. Frances-Rose Thomas, known as Frankie, took her own life at home in Witley, Surrey, on 25 September 2018 after reading a story which involved suicide on a school iPad, which had no safety features.  Her parents, Judy and Andy, said their daughter “was not safe at school” and hoped their girl’s death could at least be a “wake-up call” to DfE. Frankie was allowed unfiltered access to the iPad while attending Stepping Stones school in Hindhead, in contravention of her “bespoke education plan”, an inquest into her death heard earlier this year. An investigation into the device after her death found Frankie had been able to access online material relating to self-harm and suicide over several months. Coroner Karen Henderson described the way in which schools self-moderate material online as the “wild west” and said she was satisfied this was an “enormous and systemic failure on the part of the school”. She told the education secretary action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and called for the DfE to impose rules every educational establishment must follow. Existing guidelines issued by the DfE, she added, “require updating and are insufficiently robust to ensure their effectiveness”. “I find the way in which Stepping Stones school failed to ensure sufficient e-monitoring of Frankie’s iPad, and follow her bespoke educational plan, more than minimally contributed to her actions later that day,” Henderson said. Frankie’s parents, Judy and Andy Thomas, thanked the coroner for her report, which they said “mirrors many of our concerns about the lack of robust guidance from the Department for Education regarding e-safety in schools”. They called for more thorough inspections exceeding mere assurances from a school about their policies, such as monitored safeguarding alerts, and physical control checks of a school’s e-safety equipment. They said: “Frankie was not safe at school, despite inspections, and parents need to know that their child’s internet access at school has full protections in place. “The internet can be an extremely dangerous place, particularly for those with special educational needs like Frankie and what happened to her was a catastrophic failure. “There really are no words to describe the shock of your child suddenly dying one day – just like that – which you can never change, and we hope it will be a wake-up call which will sharpen focus regarding safety, and not just be another sad story with nothing significant changing by the Department for Education. “There must not be any complacency and there should be proactive commitment to a plan to enforce this guidance and continuously update it to reflect the ever-changing nature of the internet and the various sites that pupils may try to access. “We trust that policies will be enforced, and that guidance will not just be ‘a choice’ when pupils’ lives may be at real risk, and that this will truly result in the prevention of future deaths.” A government spokesperson said: “This tragic case highlights the vital importance of protecting children, but particularly the most vulnerable, from harmful content online – both at home and at school.” They added that the forthcoming online safety bill would help “prevent children from accessing self-harm and suicide content”.

12/11/2021,"Taking the baton from Rebecca Hall’s recently released film Passing, C’mon C’mon is another classily shot monochrome affair, this time from US director/writer/artist/all-round-creator Mike Mills (husband of director/writer/artist/all-round-creator Miranda July). Joaquin Phoenix stars; “impressively contrived”, says the Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw. It’s Mills’s fourth feature film.  Mike Mills (director) shouldn’t be confused with Mike Mills (musician) – though at some point you have to imagine their paths crossed in a Gen X version of the Spider-Man meme. The latter, of course, was a key member of alt rock behemoths REM. Though REM’s star waned in the 2000s – they gracefully called it quits in 2011 – the group could still pull in a large crowd, such as a UK tour in 2005, culminating in a concert in Hyde Park. Along the way, they played at Portman Road, home of Ipswich Town FC. Back in their late-70s glory days, full-back and captain Mick Mills was a Town legend alongside manager Bobby Robson and John Wark’s moustache. Mick Mills briefly captained England at the 1982 World Cup, standing in for the injured Kevin Keegan. In his own be-permed 70s heyday, Keegan released a pop single – a strange thing that footballers used to do. Head Over Heels in Love reached No 31 in the UK charts. The song wasco-written by Chris Norman, who had had a 1978 hit, Stumblin’ In, with pioneering rocker Suzi Quatro. In 1978, Quatro appeared as Leather Tuscadero in beloved 50s-set sitcom Happy Days. Jump forward to 1994 and you’ll find Happy Days appropriated ingeniously in Weezer’s Buddy Holly video, directed by Spike Jonze. Jonze’s most recent feature, Her, from 2014, also starred Joaquin Phoenix. Both having jumped through commercials, music videos and films at roughly the same time – and both with Coppola connections (Mills has a production company with Roman; Jonze was married to Sofia) – Mills and Jonze are almost as easily confused as Mills (director) and Mills (musician), but not Mills (Mick). Watch 20th Century Women. Mills’s previous feature film was a hazy, poignant 70s family drama led by a brilliant Annette Bening (see also Christopher Plummer’s Oscar-winning turn in Mills’s 2010 Beginners).

12/11/2021,"Some of Britain’s most prestigious universities are among those to have shared in funds totalling at least £89m from major oil companies in the last four years, an investigation has found. Oxford, Cambridge and Imperial College London are among the universities to have been given funding from some of the world’s biggest companies, according to new research by openDemocracy.  In recent months there has been increasing pressure on institutions to break links with fossil fuel companies. Last month, more than 40 senior academics and scientists signed an open letter vowing not to work with the Science Museum over its financial ties to major oil corporations. The museum faced several resignations over ties with Shell and a newly announced deal with the renewables company Adani Green Energy, part of the Adani Group, which has major holdings in coal. The new research found that Imperial College London had accepted £54m since 2017 – by far the most of any institution surveyed. It included £39m from Shell, with which the college has said it has a “longstanding and fruitful partnership”. Imperial said the confidentiality of private contracts meant it could not reveal exactly what the money was used for, stating that it funded research into “energy transition, lowering carbon emissions in extraction and in carbon mitigation measures”. Cambridge University received more than £14m from oil giants, while Oxford got almost £8m. These include large donations to Oxford’s Said Business School Centre for Corporate Reputation. OpenDemocracy used the Freedom of Information Act to ask universities for details of any funding they had accepted since 2017 from eight of the biggest oil firms: BP, Shell, Total, Equinor, Eni, Chevron, Exxon or ConocoPhillip. The figures include donations, gifts, grants and research funding. In total, 36 universities said they had received funding from eight oil giants, with others refusing to disclose whether they had received similar funding. Southampton, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Bath universities also took more than £1m each from the oil firms. In total, universities said they had received £89m – but the true figure could be far higher, because many failed to provide details. “By accepting millions of pounds in grants and sponsorship from the fossil fuel industry, UK universities are complicit in propping up and legitimising the existence and operations of some of the most harmful companies on the planet,” said Rianna Gargiulo, divestment campaigner at Friends of the Earth. “The revelation of these sponsorship deals tarnishes the reputations of the UK’s leading academic institutions, including those like the University of Cambridge that have committed to divesting from fossil fuels.” Caroline Lucas, the MP for Brighton Pavilion, said: “Let’s be clear – there is no justification for taking money from oil and gas firms and no justification for being complicit in greenwashing of these big corporations.” Some universities refused to reveal details of any links. The London School of Economics said it could not reveal any information because it would “prejudice the commercial interests of the school, by making it more difficult to raise funds from private donors in the future”. The University of Surrey also refused to disclose details of its research funding from BP, on the advice of BP itself. “After contacting BP, they confirmed that they consider the specific amount of the funding as being commercially sensitive,” the university said. Imperial College defended its funding, saying it helped to “develop meaningful solutions to climate change”. It added: “We are using our influence and expertise to accelerate this transition, and we actively engage with energy companies to push them toward the Paris agreement targets.” Cambridge University said that since October 2020, it had accepted funding from oil companies only if the collaboration would help the UK “transition to decarbonised energy”. It said: “Over the past five years funding from traditional energy sector partnerships represented about 0.5% of the University of Cambridge’s combined annual research and philanthropic income.” Oxford University said: “Those donating money or sponsoring programmes at the university have no influence over how academics carry out their research or what conclusions they reach. Our partnerships with industry allow the university to apply its knowledge to real challenges of pressing global concern, with funding often going directly into research into climate-related issues and renewables.”",News/Education,UK universities took £89m from oil firms in last four years,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2021/dec/11/uk-universities-took-89m-from-oil-firms-in-last-four-years
12/11/2021,"Exo One transposes the humble, tactile pleasures of rolling a marble along a gulley or skimming a pebble across a clear lake into a planet-straddling adventure told with all the humming sci-fi style of Stanley Kubrick’s 2001. You pilot a spherical spacecraft, powered solely by kinetic energy, across barren alien vistas, using the rise and fall of the land and your ability to increase or diminish gravity’s effect on your craft to fling your ship into the air. While soaring, you may momentarily flatten your ship into a discus shape, using air currents to provide further lift until your store of glowing power is exhausted, when you must return to the land below to recharge. On each planet your goal is simple: reach the ramp-like monolith somewhere on the horizon that is firing a beam of incandescent guiding light into the stratosphere. When touched, the monolith will shoot you into a vortex of rippling lights and flickering images on to the next planetary body. Each planet varies widely in terrain. One is covered in blustery deserts, another in rolling, milky seas.  Your ship is impervious to lava, Plutonian colds and the kind of gravitational forces that would suck the rivets from the hull of an aeroplane. Much of the game’s tactile pleasure comes from gaining momentum to soar high above the land and take in these exquisite, desolate vistas. There are none of the dials and tickers that usually clutter the screen in sci-fi games and films: your HUD is empty save for the occasional text prompt to inform you of your distance to the monolith, or the raindrops that smear across the screen. The uninterrupted views and undulating rhythms invite a near meditative state, the thrill of which deepens as your skill at manoeuvring the craft increases.

12/11/2021,"It was where many of the best things in life were brought together: art, food, wine, sex, the natural environment. And it had a hand in creating some of the UK’s most highly regarded postwar painters, including Lucian Freud and Maggi Hambling. Benton End was an extraordinary place where aspiring artists lived and studied under the tutelage of Cedric Morris and his lover Arthur Lett-Haines. Now it is being celebrated in an exhibition that for the first time brings together the alumni of the East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing.  As well as Freud and Hambling, students included Frances Hodgkins, Valerie Thornton, David Carr, Lucy Harwood and Richard Chopping. They lived and worked at the pink 16th century farmhouse near Hadleigh, Suffolk, where there was as much emphasis on gardening and cooking as there was on art. Several works lent to the Firstsite gallery in Colchester have not been seen in public before. They include The Woodpeckers, a painting by Morris of two red-headed birds astride branches against a wintry backdrop, which for decades has been hanging in a private home, slowly cracking and discolouring with age. Morris and Lett, as he was known, “taught in a very hands-off way,” said Ben Coode-Adams, an Essex artist and chair of the Victor Batte-Lay Foundation, an art collection with a focus on East Anglia. “It was more about working together and, although they were clearly in a leadership role, they weren’t dictatorial. It was really about just doing the work. They were interested in people who buckled down.” Hambling, who began studying at Benton End while still at school, said the farmhouse was “really where life began”. In an interview in 2017, she said: “Part of the attraction for me aged 15 was that it was called the artists’ house and notorious for every vice under the sun.” Benton End was considered very louche, said Coode-Adams. “There were always a lot of people, a lot of drinking, always very good food. It was quite extreme partying for the time.” The house was “notoriously filthy – no one ever cleared up”, and there was plenty of sexual activity, with Lett-Haines taking a series of female lovers alongside his lifelong relationship with Morris. The East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing was established by the couple in 1937, initially in Dedham, Essex. Sixty students enrolled within nine months. After the Dedham house burned down – apparently as a result of a cigarette discarded by Freud – the school was re-established at Benton End, where it continued for 40 years. There Morris devoted as much time to horticulture as he did art, although the two often overlapped when he painted plants and flowers. Students were also encouraged to paint in Benton End’s extensive gardens. He rose at dawn to weed his beloved flower beds, leaving Lett-Haines in bed until noon. Morris produced at least 90 new varieties of iris, travelling frequently to the Mediterranean and North Africa to find species to transport back to Suffolk. He also bred birds. Lett-Haines was uninterested in the garden, but passionate about food and cooking. Hambling recalled him serving couscous, which was almost unheard of in England in the early postwar years. His dishes, served to the artists’ community twice a day, included other foods that were unusual at the time, including garlic, olives, and aubergines grown in the garden. Copious amounts of red wine accompanied meals. Benton End had a certain “vibe”, said Stuart Tulloch, head of programme at Firstsite. “This was a cool place. It was liberal and open.” Although it produced well-known artists, there were others who studied at the school that “have never had that recognition”. The exhibition was “lifting a stone and finding teeming life underneath it”. In keeping with the Benton End ethos, the exhibition rooms are dotted with easels and paints to encourage visitors to create their own works, which will then be hung on the walls next to the main displays. Firstsite is also running workshops on wellbeing, cooking and gardening alongside the exhibition to reflect the character of the school. Life with Art “brings together a stunning selection of paintings, sculptures, etchings and drawings showcasing the amazing artists and creative talent which emanates from East Anglia,” said Sally Shaw, director of Firstsite. The aim was to “evoke a real sense of Benton End”. The influence of the school had been far-reaching, she said. “Morris was the only person of his generation to achieve national status as both an artist and a gardener, and our exhibition explores how these two disciplines intertwined to form one of the most remarkable artistic environments of the 20th century.” In 2019, Benton End was bought by the Pinchbeck trust. It plans to reopen the house and gardens as a centre for art and horticulture administered by the Garden Museum.

12/11/2021,"Up until a few weeks before his death, Mike Nesmith was touring as the Monkees with Micky Dolenz, the band’s other surviving member, performing I’m A Believer, Pleasant Valley Sunday, Daydream Believer et al, on what was billed as their farewell tour. There was a certain sweet irony in that. Nesmith was famously the Monkee most horrified by how prefabricated the Prefab Four were supposed to be. Already a gifted songwriter when he signed on for the TV show that would make him famous (Screen Gems, the company behind The Monkees, bought a couple of Nesmith’s songs for the show, although they turned down Different Drum, subsequently the song that launched Linda Ronstadt’s career) he was furious at the restrictions placed on them by producer Don Kirscher. At the height of their fame, it was Nesmith who bluntly informed a US magazine that the band didn’t play on their records – “I don’t care if we never sell another record … tell the world we don’t record our own music” – and that their current album, More of the Monkees, was “probably the worst album in the history of the world”. It was Nesmith who legendarily became so outraged by Kirscher and lawyer Herb Moelis’ high-handed treatment of the band that he put his fist through the wall of Kirscher’s Beverly Hills hotel room and informed Moelis “that could have been your face”.  It was the first in a number of genuinely groundbreaking things that Mike Nesmith would do: albeit unwittingly, he had singlehandedly minted the figure of the manufactured pop band’s loose cannon, unable to cope with the strictures of being stage-managed, willing to blow the gaff in order to escape them: a recurring character in subsequent pop history. At the time, Nesmith’s behaviour caused chaos – weirdly, rather than laud him for standing up for himself and his bandmates, the press turned on the Monkees, decrying them as “a disgrace to the pop world” – but he eventually won the fight: Kirscher was fired, and the band took control of their own musical direction. Nevertheless, Nesmith’s attitude to the Monkees seemed to remain equivocal at best. The brilliant country rock albums he made in the 70s didn’t receive the reaction they deserved, at least at the time: it was as if the Monkees’ manufactured legacy clung to his name, regardless of the music he made. Even when the Monkees’ oeuvre was reassessed as a subject befitting scholarly box sets and the TV series reshown on MTV to huge success, Nesmith remained detached. He would sometimes take part in band reunion tours and recording sessions, but usually declined. When he did agree, said reunions sometimes ended acrimoniously. “He’s always been this aloof, inaccessible person,” protested Davy Jones in 1997, “the fourth part of the jigsaw puzzle that never fit.” And yet, for the last decade of his life, Nesmith happily participated in projects featuring the Monkees’ name – long tours, and an acclaimed 2016 album Good Times!, which came with songwriting contributions from Paul Weller, Noel Gallagher and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer. On the final tour, according to the band’s latterday manager, Andrew Sandoval, Nesmith was given to making an unscripted speech onstage “about his relationship to the fans … [telling] them he knew and cared about them, and that he liked the Monkees and he liked Monkees fans”. The question of what changed is an interesting one. Perhaps the deaths of Davy Jones in 2012 and then Peter Tork in 2019 caused Nesmith to rethink his past. Or perhaps he felt that his own reputation as a musician and songwriter had become so established that the spectre of the 60s most famous manufactured boyband no longer mattered. Since the rise of Americana as a genre, he had come to be hailed as a genuinely innovative figure in the history of country rock. The Byrds had sneered at the Monkees on 1967’s So You Want To Be a Rock and Roll Star, but a couple of months before they released their genre-defining country-rock album Sweetheart of the Rodeo, you could hear Nesmith pushing the Monkees towards his own definition of cosmic American music on Tapioca Tundra, from 1968’s The Birds the Bees and the Monkees, a direction he explored further the following year on Don’t Wait For Me and the glorious Listen To the Band. His 1970s albums – some with the First National Band, some released as solo projects – had long outgrown their small cult following to be acclaimed as masterpieces of the genre. And quite rightly so: listen to 1970’s Magnetic South, or its follow-up Loose Salute, and you don’t hear someone following in the wake of the Flying Burrito Brothers or the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, but a supremely gifted songwriter intent on forging his own eccentric path through a musical fusion. Just before Covid hit, Nesmith was to be found performing 1972’s …And The Hits Just Keep On Coming live in the company of alt-rock luminaries Ben Gibbard of Death Cab For Cutie and REM alumnus Scott McCaughey. Meanwhile, his 1974 album The Prison – heavy on synthesisers and drum machines, home to the implausibly beautiful Dance Between the Raindrops, and released with an accompanying novella – went from being dismissed as “ghastly” and the work of a “crackpot” to being celebrated as a uniquely innovative triumph. And then there was the story that Nesmith had subsequently “invented” MTV: always fascinated by the potential of pop video, he had sold his video-based 1979 TV show PopClips to Time Warner, who, director William Dear said, “watered down the idea and came up with MTV”. It became so widespread that he gained a reputation as the forefather of the most powerful force in 1980s pop promotion. It was an entirely deserved and correct rewriting of history, that belatedly gave Nesmith the acclaim due to him. Maybe it altered his view of the band that kickstarted his career and that had, after all, provided a home for a succession of fabulous examples of his skill as a songwriter: not just his early country-rock experiments, but Papa Gene’s Blues; Mary, Mary; You Just May Be The One and Circle Sky, the latter his ferocious contribution to the soundtrack of the cult film Head. Certainly, at the end of his life, Papa Nez, as he styled himself, sounded like a man who had made his peace with his past. “I kind of feel like he wanted to say that he finally got it,” said Sandoval of the speech Nesmith made at the last shows he performed, “that he got why they liked it, whereas he didn’t always.”",Arts/Music,"The Monkees’ Michael Nesmith: a supremely gifted, innovative songwriter",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/dec/11/the-monkees-michael-nesmith-a-supremely-gifted-innovative-songwriter
12/11/2021,"Immediacy, radiance and an ability to welcome the past into the present: not all there is to say on the matter, but an attempt to pinpoint the essence of James MacMillan’s music. For MacMillan (b.1959), a Scottish-born Roman Catholic, spirituality has been key to his work since a childhood fascination with plainchant and liturgy. His faith has empowered him to freewheel against fashion, gathering a large and responsive audience, from every domain, with him. Who else would dare write a full-length Christmas Oratorio (2019), with Bach’s own example and Handel’s Messiah already cramming the limited seasonal space available? And who would start this work, after a gurgle of woodwind and a lilting Scots air, with that most tinkling, twinkly of instruments, the celesta – best known for its use in a sweeter Christmas favourite, the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy from Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker?  The celestial reverie is soon punctuated by a volley of solo timpani, an anger unleashed. Human suffering, characterised by Herod’s massacre of the innocents, figures prominently in this two-part work, each half opening and closing with orchestral interludes. Texts, in Latin, English and Scottish Gaelic, are drawn from poetry, liturgy and scripture, deftly interwoven. Scored for a moderate sized orchestra, with a percussion section including the different timbres of hi-hat, cabasa, timbales, vibraphone and xylophone, as well as harp and celesta, it achieves sonic range via economic means. The entire composition – its UK premiere given by the work’s co-commissioners, the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir, conducted by Mark Elder – is riven with short fortissimo outbursts as brutal as the four-part choral writing is at times exquisite and hushed. The babe-in-manger chorus at the start of Part 2, O magnum mysterium, from the matins for Christmas Day, could stand alone, though this majestic work deserves full performance. The two soloists, soprano Lucy Crowe at her ethereal best and baritone Roderick Williams, expressive and articulate, provide meditative arias – poetry by Robert Southwell, John Donne and John Milton, sometimes with elaborate, Bach-like violin solo (Pieter Schoeman). The London Philharmonic Choir (director Neville Creed) sang impressively throughout, the tenors, fewer in number than sopranos, altos and basses, occasionally sounding in need of a few more recruits, but always musical and accurate. No surprise to find the audience giving orchestra, chorus, conductor, soloists and, above all, composer a standing ovation. More cheers erupted on Wednesday when Vladimir Jurowski, for 14 years the LPO’s revered principal conductor, returned for the first time in his new emeritus role (also relayed live on BBC Radio 3). There wasn’t one weak link in this ambitious programme. The world premiere of Brett Dean’s revised Notturno inquieto was miasmic and glistening, microscopic in sonic detail, bold in aim (with superb playing, especially, from principal violas, low woodwind, trombones, percussion – OK, let’s say everyone). In two mid-20th century Russian works – Shostakovich’s Violin Concerto No 1 in A minor, Op 77 and Rachmaninov’s Symphony No 3 – the players’ assurance and virtuosity bore golden fruit. The Rachmaninov was taut, intense, poetic. The Shostakovich engages in that same struggle MacMillan confronts in his Oratorio: songlike beauty constantly rising above aural brutality, encapsulated in the stupefying cadenza. Jurowski might have been the returning hero but the solo violinist, the phenomenal Alina Ibragimova, was the night’s brilliant star.
