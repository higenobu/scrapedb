2/5/2022,"Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre examines the market and takes a look at Amazon's surging shares and Kohl's rallying stocks. EMILY MCCORMICK: Well, let's head over now to Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre for a deeper dive on today's market action. Jared, take it away. JARED BLIKRE: Well, that's right. Earlier this morning, around 8:30 AM when those numbers dropped, admittedly, the payrolls number, the headline went quite the surprise to the upside. Stocks took a leg down, but that would soon be the low. Really recovered around 10:00, 10:30 AM. And it's been off ever since. NASDAQ up over 2%, S&P 500 up over 1%, and the Dow up about 1/3 of a percent. The big mover today, Amazon. Amazon up 15%. That is the biggest price move in one day in about a decade, and very impressive to see them just killing it on Amazon Web Services. Also advertising may be as profitable as AWS. That's been their cash cow, their profit center historically, but just lots to celebrate for Amazon investors there. But I do want to show a chart because over the last two years, this is a stock that has largely traded sideways. We had a few breaks to the record highs before, but we have settled back down into a trading range. So nothing new in terms of the technicals there for Amazon. I do want to check out another retailer. This is Kohl's, and this has been a story about probably Starboard. Starboard Investors, an activist group, had put in an offer for $64 per share earlier, and this is a two-year chart, so $64 somewhere up in here. That was a $9 billion deal that has been rejected formally this morning. And when you take a look at who's advising them on the deal, well, they have instituted Goldman Sachs, or they've asked Goldman Sachs, as well as PJT Partners to interact with interested parties. They also put a poison pill that will make it harder for the company to be acquired without the consent of the board. Now I have a statement from the company. The company's directors are, quote, ""committed to acting in the best interest of shareholders and will continue to closely evaluate any opportunities to create value."" We did get a statement from Macellum Advisors. They are now looking into the matter. They say that they're disappointed and shocked by the company's rejection of this indication of interest. And guess what? They're going to nominate a new board. So lots of drama in the retail space, guys.",Business/Yahoo Finance Video,Kohl's takes 'poison pill' to thwart hostile takeover,https://news.yahoo.com/kohls-takes-poison-pill-thwart-202049492.html
2/5/2022,"You are allowed to disagree, Bill Maher argued during his Friday Real Time on HBO. And he brought up two instances of news this week from the world of television to underline his point. Maher talked about Whoopi Goldberg’s crisis and suspension from The View because of her analysis of what the Holocaust was really about. Maher, who has been targeted by Goldberg in the past, said he was not in favor of her cancellation, “as much as I disagree with her crazy statements.” More from Deadline 'Euphoria' Renewed For Season 3 By HBO AT&T's John Stankey And Discovery's David Zaslav Avoid Talking Details Of Jeff Zucker's Exit: ""Unfortunate Set Of Circumstances"" 'Somebody Somewhere' Renewed For Season 2 At HBO He pointed out Goldberg’s show is called THE View, emphasis on “The.” That’s the problem in America,” he said. “There is one true opinion, and everyone else can go sit in the corner.” He pointed out a time where Goldberg defended quarterback Michael Vick, who was suspended from football for his role in a dog fighting ring. Goldberg was a rare defender of Vick when that situation emerged, pointing out that his southern heritage and cultural upbringng normalized such behaviors. “I don’t agree with her, but we grew up in two different worlds,” Maher acknowledged. “The answer is not to make them sit in a corner.” He added that the request that Goldberg use her suspension to “reflect and learn” is “so insulating.” There is no “impact” from her words, he said. “There are not neo-Nazis waiting for the green light from a lady on The View. Panelist Katherine Mangu-Ward, the editor-in-chief of Reason Magazine and co-host of The Reason Roundtable podcast, was supportive of Maher’s views. “Not everything has to be for everybody,” she said. She added that The View is a particularly weird place. “It’s not called “The Facts.” Johann Hari, author of Stolen Focus: Why You Can’t Pay Attention — And How To Think Deeply Again, also decried silencing others. “We don’t need free speech when we’re right. We need it when we’re wrong.” Maher also brought up former CNN President Jeff Zucker, who resigned from that news organization this week, allegedly for failure to disclose an affair. “He is 56 and having a relationship with a 49-year-old who is also an executive – and he had to resign over that? I don’t underand that. ” Mangu-Ward agreed. “I would be delighted to never know anything about the sex life of CNN C-suite,” she said. But she also brought up that the resignation may have been tied to anchor Chris Cuomo’s problems. The desire to keep things quiet may be tied to Zucker’s failure to disclose. “Let’s look into that,” she said. Maher had a rejoinder.”In the old days, this was called discretion.” Earlier in the show, Maher had a one-on-one with Congressman Ro Khanna, who represents California’s 17th district and is author of the new book, Dignity in a Digital Age: Making Tech Work for All of Us. Khanna defended the Democrats economic message, which he said was focused on providing digital jobs opportunities in areas outside of Silicon Valley, New York, and Austin. Wrapping up his show, Maher took a cynical look at the mixed message on the pandemic being delivered by some in government and health officials. That’s even as certain leaders appear maskless at public events, and rules abound about wearing masks in restaurants while walking to your table, but not while eating or drinking, all of which defy common sense. While some other countries are scaling back and relaxing pandemic protocols, certain areas of the US refuse to budge. “We are afraid to identify threats by likelihood,” Maher said. “When people ask me why are you so skeptical of what medical professionals tell us? I’ve seen this before,” he said, citing the HIV panic in 1987, wherein some predicted a wave of hetrosexual transmission that never materialized. Maher called for an end to fear campaigns, pointing out that the likely targets for Covid-19 health problems – the elderly, the obese, the unvaccinated – were not his responsibility at this point. “Doesn’t it make more sense to let the rest of us go back to living normal lives?” he asked. “There will always be another variant.” Maher called for a return to “something like normal,” and pointed out the various times the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have delivered wrong messages. “We’ve had this problem in medicine for a long time,” he said. “The same people who always say get a second opinion want only one in the public debate. They have not earned the right to claim monopoly status.” [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UrgyVFFpeQ?version=3&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://deadline.com&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent&w=640&h=360] Best of Deadline Cancellations/Renewals Scorecard: TV Shows Ended Or Continuing In 2021-22 Season What's New On HBO Max For January 2022: Day-By-Day Listings For TV Shows & Movies New On Prime Video For January 2022: Daily Listings For Streaming TV, Movies & More Sign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

2/5/2022,"A medical doctor in Houston is suing Chase bank over allegations of racial discrimination. Dr. Malika Mitchell-Stewart says she was ""treated like a criminal"" when she tried to open an account. Chase apologized for the experience and said it is investigating the situation. Fresh out of residency and in a new full-time job as a physician with Valley Oaks Medical Group, Dr. Malika Mitchell-Stewart visited a Houston area Chase bank branch to open an account and deposit her first check. When she presented the $16,780.16 to the teller, the teller began to ask ""peculiar questions"" about its authenticity and Mitchell-Stewart's employment, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in US District Court. ""Dr. Mitchell-Stewart certainly did not expect that when she attempted to open a bank account with Chase and proudly deposit her first check as a new physician she would be accused of fraud and denied the ability to open a bank account at one of the more prominent retail banks in the world,"" the complaint said. ""We take this matter very seriously and are investigating the situation,""a Chase spokesperson told Insider. ""We have reached out to Dr. Mitchell-Stewart to better understand what happened and apologize for her experience."" According to the lawsuit, when the first teller asked another branch employee for an opinion on the check (which represented a signing bonus), the second employee declared it to be fraudulent without offering any justification. Personal ID, emails, and business cards were not enough to change the employees' minds, the suit says. ""They took my special moment away. I felt like a criminal,"" Mitchell-Stewart told KTRK, which first reported the suit,. ""In order to get Texas medical license or a medical license at all, you have to have a clean record. You have to go to school for so many years, and they just didn't care. They didn't respect that. They didn't respect my credentials.""

2/5/2022,"MANILA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday defended the sale of an oil and gas concession to a firm controlled by a tycoon ally after a senate panel approved the filing of charges against energy ministry officials. ""I am convinced that this was a private transaction between private entities that must be respected,"" Duterte said, adding that the national interest has been protected. Udenna Corp, a company owned by Dennis Uy, a friend of Duterte, acquired https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-chevron-malampaya-idUSKBN1XN1AG Chevron Corp's 45% in the country's Malampaya gas-to-power project worth $565 million in 2019. Uy, the biggest contributor to Duterte's presidential campaign in 2016, has seen his empire rapidly expand through acquisitions and entry into businesses such as casinos, shipping and telecommunications. A senate resolution on Thursday approved the filing of criminal and administrative charges before the anti-graft body against Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi and 11 other energy officials in relation to the sale. The energy ministry cleared the Udenna-Chevron deal in April 2021. It has called a graft complaint https://www.reuters.com/article/philippines-gas-udenna-idUKL4N2RF2HS filed last year ""groundless"". Duterte said he trusts Cusi, the president of the country's ruling political party, who will remain as the energy chief. ""I will not allow this valuable resource to be jeopardised and embroiled in the political antics of some members of the senate,"" Duterte said. The Philippine senate doubted the technical and financial ability of Udenna to operate the project, and questioned the soundness of the energy ministry's financial evaluation of the buyer. The Malampaya project provides fuel for power plants with a combined capacity of more than 3,000 megawatts. In response to a request for comment, Chevron said it ""complies with all applicable laws and regulations wherever it operates or has business interests"". Cusi and Udenna did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Udenna has previously insisted Uy's association with Duterte has not given his businesses an unfair advantage.
