2/22/2022,"Scott Morrison’s efforts to politicise Australia’s complex relationship with China seems to be further soiling his own flagging reputation. Like a bull in the proverbial, he has spent the past fortnight bombarding the airwaves with hastily googled dossiers and cold war-era panics to suggest an Albanese government would become an antipodean branch office of the Beijing Politburo.  Large sections of the national gallery have embraced his China pivot, breathlessly reporting the attacks on Labor, amplifying intelligence community blowback and catastrophising operational incidents that would normally demand sober assessment rather than tabloid splashes. But this week’s Guardian Essential Report suggests the Australian public is neither as excitable nor gullible as sections of the media, with Labor regarded as the party better placed to manage Australia’s relationship with China. These results will seem counterintuitive to those of us who follow politics closely and are conditioned to assume the Coalition has a national advantage on national security. But when this issue is laid out in the context of Australia’s interests rather than the generality, the China attack does not appear to be working. The most effective scare campaigns connect with disengaged voters in a concrete way. For all its artifice, the 2019 assault on Labor’s plans to rein in tax concessions spoke to the hip pocket. So too Keating’s “no GST” demolition of John Hewson in 1993. Howard scared voters on interest rates in 2004 and Labor nearly did the same from opposition with Medicare in 2016. When incumbents have won elections on national security scares, they have done so when the issue was already dominating the public discourse in a way that people saw a direct connection with their personal wellbeing. Robert Menzies’ “reds under the bed” demolition of Herbert Vere Evatt in 1955 was in the heat of the cold war where Australia’s loyalties were clear, Soviet spies were being expelled and his political opponents were literally splitting down the middle. Howard’s “turn back the boats” election in 2001 was prosecuted in the aftershocks of the September 11 terror attacks. The latest attacks on Labor over China are different. While Australian politics has moved from a broad consensus on engaging with China to a more adversarial outlook as Xi Jinping has consolidated power, there is not the same immediate heat in the issue. Indeed, according to another question in this week’s report, the vast majority of voters see China as a complex issue to be managed rather than a threat to be confronted. In other words, the clear majority of Australians support a position which is the polar opposite to the government’s current tub-thumping. In fact, the only group of voters who see the Coalition as being better equipped to manage the China relationship are those in the minority who see China as a threat to be confronted. In this context, you can make the argument the prime minister is really doing nothing but talking to his base. And not even all of the base. For those in business relationships with China or in industries with trade exposure, the relationship has far greater meaning than a set of politicised debating points. On our figures, that includes a majority of Coalition voters. The implications of these findings are clear for Labor as well. Rather than being drawn into defending every nuanced statement made in the party’s name over the past decade it can safely characterise this as simply another distraction with the very real potential to undermine the national interest. And let’s not ignore the political risk inherent in the China gambit. An estimated 6% of Australians identify as Chinese-Australian, with numbers concentrated in some of the more marginal Coalition seats, especially Sydney’s Banks and Reid where well-credential Asian Australian candidates are standing for Labor. Further muting the prime minister’s attacks is his own credibility as the attack dog. Morrison’s personal approval has deteriorated another five points into net negative over the past month (44% approve/49% disapprove), while Labor leader Anthony Albanese is in positive territory for the first time (42% approve/ 39% disapprove). And on a raft of personal attributes, the prime minister’s stocks are in freefall. Looking at these numbers, the China strategy appears more like a Hail Mary from a leader flailing for an issue to galvanise fear of likely change than a seriously constructed voter persuasion proposition. These are the figures of a leader who has burnt most – if not all – of his political capital, who the public see as untrustworthy, out of touch and lacking vision. When considering the mishandling of the China card, the diminished stature of the dealer cannot be discounted. Of course, the PM may have a grander plan, a constant drip, drip of “on-water incidents”, maybe a round of Petrov-style expulsions of Chinese diplomats or academics. Perhaps a Russian invasion of the Ukraine will further heighten local anxiety about the state of the world. More likely the only national defence consideration on this issue is the one to keep him in power. We know Morrison is at heart a marketeer, testing messages on the run and iterating them until they stick. It took him months of tortious analogy to come up with “the Bill we can’t afford”. But there’s a broader principle in design and innovation that he would be well served embracing: when it comes to China it is in the national interest for him to “fail fast” and move on to his next confected scare campaign. Anyone mention “union bosses”?

2/22/2022,"The number of women in FTSE 100 boardroom roles has jumped to 39.1% from 12.5% 10 years ago, data has revealed, even as equality charities said progress for women in senior leadership roles was severely lagging. In 2020, 36.2% of boardroom roles on the index were held by women, climbing dramatically from 26.6% in 2016, the global data company BoardEx found. However, the Fawcett Society said the figures do not capture the “shocking lack of diversity” laid bare in its 2022 Sex and Power Index, with “women of colour, disabled women and LGBTQ people missing from positions of power”.  Jemima Olchawski, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive, welcomed the progress but said: “The devil is in the detail here. In the majority of boardrooms men continue to be overrepresented. When we look at the most senior positions of CEO and chair the progress is painfully slow.” Women make up only eight of the chief executives at the UK’s top 100 listed companies, leading some observers to argue that while progress is being made on gender targets, advances on women in senior leadership roles have stalled. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the BoardEx figures were evidence the UK’s “voluntary, business-led approach” to equality is working “without the need for mandatory quotas” as deployed in countries such as Germany. However, the Fawcett Society pushed back, with Olchawski saying “the voluntary approach has real limits” that mean “the laggards can simply opt out”. She called for a government requirement for companies to publish actions plans. According to the FTSE 100 figures, the UK climbed to second in international ranking of 12 similar countries – behind only France on almost 44% – rising from fifth place last year. The data refers to boardroom roles at the 100 largest companies by market capitalisation listed on the London Stock Exchange. Laura Whitcombe, a global campaign manager at the 30% Club, said there has been some great progress but added: “To focus on the boards could distract from the fact that we’re not making much progress at the executive level. “The pipeline of women progressing throughout organisations – right up to the top, to those executives that form the executive committee – that pipeline has got a bottleneck.” Women in boardroom roles for the top 250 companies is lower, at 36.8%, compared with 33.2% in 2020. Olchawski said it is “shocking” there are no women of colour on the FTSE 100 chief executive list. “We must break down the barriers that prevent women, in all their diversity, rising to the top,” she said. The FTSE Women Leaders Review, an independent government-supported organisation that reports progress on women’s representation and suggests recommendations, increased its voluntary target for FTSE 350 companies from 33% to 40% of board positions by 2025. “We know there is much more work to do and no shortage of experienced, capable women, ambitious for themselves and their company across all sectors of business today,” said Denise Wilson, the chief executive of the FTSE Women Leaders Review, who also urged progress in leadership roles. The data showed that 72 of the UK’s top 350 companies are still below a previous 33% target for women on boards. Liz Truss, the minister for women and equalities, said: “It is excellent to see the progress being made but we know there is more to be done.” She said the government plans to put forward measures to advance workplace equality but gave no further details.",News/Business,Number of women in FTSE 100 boardroom roles up to 39% in a decade,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/number-of-women-in-ftse-100-boardroom-roles-up-in-a-decade
2/22/2022,"Britain’s urban hedgehogs are showing signs of recovery, according to a new report, but rural populations have fallen by as much as 75% in some regions in just 20 years. The charismatic prickly creature, voted the UK’s favourite mammal in 2016, has experienced a dramatic fall in numbers since the turn of the millennium due to loss of habitat, attacks by dogs, vanishing prey and being killed by traffic. However, new analysis of hedgehog surveys has revealed a stark distinction between the fortunes of the town and country hedgehog, with clear signs the urban population has stabilised and may even be on the up.  Counting the nocturnal mammal is difficult, with the total UK population believed to be about 879,000 in 2018. They are now listed as vulnerable to extinction in Britain’s red list for mammals and are the subject of significant conservation efforts, with campaigns to create “hedgehog highways” to connect habitats and more than 100,000 “hedgehog champions”. The State of Britain’s Hedgehogs 2022 report, produced by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS), brings together data from five ongoing surveys, with the two urban counts showing an upward trend and an estimated 200,000 to 250,000 hedgehogs in suburban and inner-city green spaces. “We’ve known for a long time there has been a historic decline in hedgehogs. But the report highlights the difference between urban and rural populations,” said Fay Vass, head of the BHPS. “The rural populations are continuing to plummet. They’ve been declining by 30% to 75% across different areas of the countryside since the year 2000. In contrast, the urban hedgehog seems to have stabilised and might even be starting to recover after having previously also been in freefall. So that’s a glimmer of hope.” The outlook for rural hedgehogs remains bleak, according to the report. While the east Midlands and east of England are home to some of the country’s largest population densities, they have also experienced significant declines, falling 74% and 35% respectively since 1994. In the last decade, the loss has been a third and a quarter of their respective hedgehog populations, according to the report. The mammals, which have been in Britain for at least half a million years, are primarily threatened by habitat loss and the accompanying lack of prey such as beetles and earthworms. Conservationists are trying to better understand the declines in the countryside and are working with farmers to help them better manage their land for the animals. Hugh Warwick, an ecologist who is leading a national campaign to make hedgehog highways a legal requirement on new housing developments, said: “We’ve got a slight uptick [in urban populations]. That’s really exciting but we must be cautious. It’s got to be put in the context of a massively degraded situation already.” To help the animal’s recovery, Warwick encourages gardeners to embrace messier gardens. “We must get rid of the cult of tidiness. It’s an absurd cult, which is driven by gardening programmes and glossy magazines. Gardens should be a place that we share with nature,” he said. Researchers at Nottingham Trent University are also investigating the relationship between badger and hedgehog populations, with evidence that the presence of badgers negatively affects the prickly creatures. Most abundant in the south-west of England and south Wales, badgers prey on hedgehogs and compete with them for food.

2/22/2022,"China’s national defence ministry has accused the Australian defence force of “spiteful and provocative actions” as it brushed off the accusation that its warship had shone a laser at an Australian surveillance plane. The Australian government had demanded an explanation from Beijing over a “dangerous, unprofessional and reckless” incident last Thursday in which it said a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA-N) warship had used a laser to illuminate an Australian P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft.  The Australian aircraft had been tracking two PLA-N vessels that were sailing east through the Arafura Sea, north of Australia. A new statement issued by the China’s national defence ministry did not address the claim of the laser use in any detail. Instead, the statement said the PLA-N vessel “maintained safe, normative and professional operations” and accused the Australian side of spreading “false information” and making an “irresponsible claim”. The ministry also made two claims of its own, including that the Australian P-8A surveillance aircraft had “approached the airspace” over the PLA-N vessels “with the nearest distance of only 4km”. A ministry spokesperson said that was “very close”. The second claim was that the Australian aircraft had cast a sonar buoy into the water around the Chinese vessel. Such a device – also known as a sonobuoy – can be used to gather acoustic information and help detect submarines. An image released by China’s national defence ministry shows a triangular orange buoy in the water. The ministry’s spokesperson, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, accused the ADF of “spiteful and provocative actions” that would “undoubtedly result in misunderstanding and threaten the safety of aircraft, vessel and personnel of both sides”. “China is firmly opposed to these actions by the Australia,” he said. He called on Australia to “stop such provocative and risky actions” and “avoid negative effects on the relationship of the two countries and two militaries”. Australia responded quickly to the latest statement by saying there was much greater distance between the plane and the warship at the time the laser was used. A Defence spokesperson said: “At the time of the lasing incident the RAAF P-8A Poseidon was approximately 7,700m from the People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA-N) vessel and was flying at an altitude of 457m.” The Australian spokesperson confirmed that “the closest the P-8 flew to the PLA-N vessel was approximately 3,900m”. “This is a standard flight profile for Royal Australian Air Force maritime patrol aircraft for a visual inspection of a surface vessel,” the spokesperson said. The Australian statement did not specifically address Beijing’s claim that Australia had dropped a sonobuoy in the water. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the Australian surveillance aircraft was “exactly where it was allowed to be, doing everything they were allowed to do and keeping eyes on those who are coming into our exclusive economic zone”. “They were doing their job as they do every single day and we make no apology for where our surveillance aircraft are looking after and protecting Australia,” Morrison told reporters on Tuesday. The prime minister said the use of the laser was “extremely disappointing” and required a full explanation from Beijing, “not for it to be dismissed or shunted off or some of the usual responses that we get”. The independent South Australian senator Rex Patrick said the laser incident was “unprovoked” and “unquestionably an aggressive act, intended to intimidate”. He called on the government to “declare China’s defence attaché in Canberra persona non grata and require him to leave Australia without delay”. “The Chinese government’s refusal to accept fault for this serious incident and their spurious claim that Australia is ‘spreading malicious disinformation’ requires an emphatic response from the Australian government to register just how unacceptable China’s behaviour has and continues to be,” Patrick said in a statement. Senior Australian diplomatic staff in Beijing have raised Thursday’s incident with China’s ministries of foreign affairs and national defence. Officials in Canberra have also raised it with the Chinese embassy. The Australian government first disclosed the laser incident in a statement issued late on Saturday by Defence, which said the “unprofessional and unsafe military conduct” could have “endangered the safety and lives of the ADF personnel”. Morrison quickly declared it to be an “act of intimidation” and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, also characterised China’s actions as an “outrageous act of aggression” and “a reckless act”. Labor has sought a briefing from the government on the incident, which has emerged as the latest flashpoint in the increasingly strained relationship between Australia and China. Morrison has cited the incident as he ramps up pre-election rhetoric about national security.",News/Australia news,China accuses Australian defence force of ‘spiteful’ actions after laser accusation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/china-accuses-australian-defence-force-of-spiteful-actions-over-laser-accusation
2/22/2022,"The $8bn dollar takeover bid for AGL Energy is a sign the “world is waking up” to the rapid shifts in electricity generation and demand with the surprise only in its timing, Kerry Schott, the former chair of Australia’s Energy Security Board, has said. The 185-year-old energy firm on Monday rejected the unsolicited bid by Australian technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian asset manager Brookfield as it “materially undervalues the company”.  The bidders say they would shut AGL’s coal-fired power plants by 2035. AGL, which plans to close its Liddell plant by April 2023, said earlier this month it would expedite the demise of its Bayswater plant to no later than 2033 and Loy Yang A by 2045. Schott, who headed the national coordinating energy group until last October, said the bidders’ plans merely aligned the timetable to the current trajectory seen as most likely by the Australian energy market operator. “The world’s waking up to the disruption that’s been going on in electricity for a while now,” Schott said. “It gets down to how fast can we get the renewables in and keep the transmission system stable as we go.” Origin Energy last week said it had no choice but to bring forward the closure of its Eraring coal-fired plant – Australia’s largest power station – by seven years to 2025. Schott said Eraring had often been running on fewer than all of its four units already, as had AGL’s Bayswater, because of their inability to compete with the near-zero fuel costs of wind and solar. Both are in New South Wales and burn black coal. “For the orderly transition, we do need to make sure we’ve got a backup of either pumped hydro or gas, frankly, and there will be the need to keep some coal … while those [new generation and storage assets] are getting built,” Schott said. “You can’t just turn everything off tomorrow – it’d be a disaster.” Commonwealth-owned Snowy Hydro was one way the federal government could support the transition, as well as the funding it was giving to aid new transmission lines to allow more renewables on to the grid, she said. It was also Labor’s “stated policy” to do even more to fund new transmission should it win this year’s elections. The states, including NSW and Victoria, were also prioritising new grid connections that would allow them to expand renewables and meet their carbon emission reduction goals, which are more ambitious than the Morrison government’s, Schott said. Analysts and some within AGL see access to the company’s 4.5 million customers across the country as a key motivation for any would-be suitor. Tim Buckley, director of Climate Energy Finance and a leading decarbonisation advocate, said Mike Cannon-Brookes’ almost $80m shareholding of Brighte Capital – which retails solar panels and battery packages to households – revealed the potential for a huge expansion of the business in Australia. Cannon-Brookes has “been involved in that for two years and learning by doing what’s involved,” Buckley said. “It’s about doing that now at 10 times the speed using the existing customer base of AGL.” A spokesperson said Brighte had notched up more than 100,000 households as customers since starting in 2015. It has retail licences in NSW, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, and has applied for one in Victoria. “We’re excited about [Cannon-Brookes’] bid to take over AGL,” she said, adding it would bring forward the opportunity “to move Australia towards a clean energy future but there’s no impact on Brighte that we can share”. Buckley said Origin Energy had lately touted the success of its purchase of Octopus Energy as a rapidly growing artificial intelligence-driven energy retailer in the UK, showing the potential for similar expansion in Australia. “It’s been growing it at 50 to 100% year on year over the last five years,” he said. “It’s got 2.8 million customers in the UK, and it’s all about using the smart grid to drive lower electricity prices for consumers and to drive decarbonisation.” AGL declared on Monday that its plan to split by 30 June into a mostly generating company, Accel Energy, and a retail arm, AGL Australia, remained on track. Still, within AGL, there’s some excitement at the prospect that an entrepreneur with Cannon-Brookes’ success at creating a software firm worth many billions of dollars was making a play for their company. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While AGL had lost as much as 80% of its share value over the past five years prior to the takeover offer, the company had started to bounce back with the stock up by half in the past 12 months. Its shares gained more than 10% during Monday’s trade. “It feels like the market has turned the corner,” said one staffer who was not authorised to speak publicly. AGL’s purchase of a majority stake in UK energy retailer OVO – a rival to Octopus – was a sign the company was already determined to expand such businesses. Whether or not the bidders lift their offer or others enter the fray, though, AGL does face some challenges, including what to do with its 3.2 million gas customers. The company has struggled to secure supplies of that fossil fuel after opposition to its coal seam gas plans in NSW and a gas import terminal in Victoria forced AGL to abandon both projects. The AGL Australia arm also has a net zero greenhouse gas emissions goal by 2040, which would be difficult to achieve if it were to continue to retail gas.",News/Business,‘World is waking up’: ex-energy boss Kerry Schott says AGL bid a sign of big changes ahead,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/world-is-waking-up-ex-energy-boss-kerry-schott-says-agl-bid-a-sign-of-big-changes-ahead
2/22/2022,"Neil Balnaves, the Australian arts philanthropist and former television executive, has died aged 77 after a boating accident. Leading figures from the arts industry have paid tribute to Balnaves as a man who had a vision to “create a better Australia”.  The Balnaves Foundation released a small statement on Tuesday, confirming his death. “The Balnaves family sends their heartfelt thank for people’s kind words and wishes and kindly requests privacy at this difficult time,” it said. Balnaves was reportedly holidaying with his wife, Diane, near Tahiti when the accident occurred. Balnaves had a successful career in TV, running Southern Star production house and producing popular shows, including Big Brother, Bananas in Pyjamas, Water Rats and McLeod’s Daughters. After a string of successes, he became chair of the Ardent Leisure Group – which runs theme parks such as Dreamworld on the Gold Coast – from 2003 until 2016. After a boating accident on the Gold Coast in 2002, which almost killed him, Balnaves became an avid philanthropist. He gave away $20m of his fortune to arts organisations. “As you can imagine, I had a lot of time to think throughout this period,” he told the Advertiser in 2011. “And what I came to was this: How many more houses do I need? Do I want the jet plane? Do I want another yacht? Not really. “There comes a time when those things stop meaning so much to you.” Guardian Australia was just one of the beneficiaries of his philanthropic foundation, which also donated to Sydney’s Ensemble and Belvoir Street theatres, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Art Gallery of South Australia, the Adelaide festival and Bangarra Dance Theatre. The foundation gave a grant to Guardian Australia for in-depth reporting on Indigenous affairs, and an in-depth reporting project on Australian art. “When I was first exploring the idea of philanthropy as a means to speed Guardian Australia’s expansion and extend our reporting into new areas, it was often difficult to incorporate our absolute requirement for complete editorial independence with the usual way grants were structured,” Guardian Australia editor Lenore Taylor said. “Neil and his son Hamish immediately understood and their generous grants have provided a template for further philanthropic projects, with philanthropy now an accepted model for media companies to undertake reporting above and beyond their current capacities. The Balnaves Foundation grants have funded two ongoing multiple award-winning streams of journalism, in Indigenous investigations, and culture reporting.” The Balnaves Foundation also funded Indigenous and health research. Balnaves is survived by his wife, Diane Balnaves, who he married in 1971, and his children, Hamish and Victoria. Sadly, their eldest child, Alexandra, died in 2019 following a long illness. In a statement Mark Kilmurry, artistic di­rector of Sydney’s Ensemble Theatre, which is sponsored by the foundation, remembered Balnaves as a great friend. “Yesterday afternoon we were informed of the shocking and terribly sad news of Neil Balnaves’ fatal boating accident while on holidays,” Kilmurry said. “Neil Balnaves, through the Balnaves Foundation, was not only a major sponsor of Ensemble Theatre but he became a great friend and supporter. “Neil had a vision to create a better Australia through education, medicine and the arts, especially First Nations artists, and was never afraid to stand up for what he believed in,” Kilmurry said. Kilmurry described Balnaves as a champion for the creative community, not just with his philanthropy but his personal passion for the arts. “We will miss his generous and fearless spirit,” he said. People from Australia’s arts community paid tribute to his life on social media. “A believer in the importance and impact of the arts as an essential element of communities,” the CEO of Creative Partnerships Australia, Fiona Menzies, wrote on Twitter. “His philanthropy was generous and committed.” Journalist and arts writer Ashleigh Wilson described Balnaves as a “tireless, visionary, inspiring advocate for the arts in Australia”. “He believed in the transformational possibilities of culture and the power of storytelling. He’ll be greatly missed,” Wilson wrote.",News/Australia news,"Neil Balnaves, Australian arts philanthropist, dies aged 77 after boating accident",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/neil-balnaves-australian-arts-philanthropist-dies-aged-77-after-boating-accident
