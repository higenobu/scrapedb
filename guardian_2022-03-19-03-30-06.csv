3/19/2022,"Ukrainian refugees waiting to travel to join relatives in Britain have voiced frustration at the length of time the Home Office is taking to process UK visas, despite government promises to streamline the system. As the Homes for Ukraine scheme launched on Friday, allowing UK residents to sponsor visas for non-family members, Ukrainians who had already applied to join relatives in Britain under an earlier scheme expressed dismay at the long waits for visa approvals. At least 43,000 have applied for Ukraine family scheme visas and are waiting for their applications to be approved. Many of them are staying in hotels in countries bordering Ukraine, repeatedly checking their emails to see if visa clearance has been granted. Taitiana Dembicka, 73, a retired university administrator from Kyiv, has changed hotel in Bucharest six times in the past seven days as she waits for a visa to allow her to travel with her son, Eugene, a British citizen, to his home in the UK. Many of the city’s hotels are crowded with refugees and they have struggled to find somewhere to stay for more than one night. Her application was submitted two weeks ago, on 4 March. When staff in the office of Eugene’s local MP, Lucy Frazer, asked the Home Office why the process was taking longer than anticipated, they were told that further checks had been requested. “I feel disappointed,” Eugene said. “She has applied previously for a UK visa many, many times, so I’m not clear what they’re actually checking.” Taitiana said: “We’re told that UK government is helping us, but we don’t feel it.” Sarah Keeley, an immigration lawyer who has volunteered to offer free legal advice to Ukrainians fleeing the conflict under the Ukraine Advice Project, said she had heard from many people stuck in hotels waiting for visas to be approved. She said the problems were mostly caused by the government’s decision not to waive visas for people travelling from Ukraine. “We are pushing people through a managed migration visa process which necessarily creates these unconscionable delays,” she said. Natalia, a Scottish university employee, who asked for her surname not to be published, was waiting for her 72-year-old mother’s visa application to be cleared. Her mother fled Kharkiv with just a handbag earlier this month and is stuck in Warsaw until her UK visa, which she applied for a fortnight ago, is processed. “What really infuriates me about this whole situation is not the wait in itself, and not even the significant financial cost, but a total lack of communication and accountability,” Natalia said. Anna Malyna White, an interpreter from Glasgow, was still waiting for visas for her parents, 84 and 82, to be approved two weeks after they applied. She was staying with them in a hotel outside Budapest. “Everything is done to make this process as difficult and complicated as possible,” she said. “I was advised that my parents should fall into a priority category due to their age and health issues. We are surviving on a credit card as nobody could foresee being drawn into such a complicated red tape visa process. There is no communication with the [Home Office] and there is no mechanism allowing us to track our progress online.” Figures for the number of people applying to sponsor Ukrainians under the new Homes for Ukraine scheme have not been released. A Home Office spokesperson said: “We stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine and the changes we’ve made to the visa process are making it quicker and simpler for Ukrainians to come here, as well as ensuring those already here can stay. Staff are working seven days a week to process applications as quickly as possible.”",News/UK news,Ukrainian refugees with UK relatives frustrated by Home Office visa delays,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/18/ukrainian-refugees-with-uk-relatives-frustrated-by-home-office-visa-delays
3/19/2022,"Middlemarch, George Eliot’s capacious imagining of the life of a Midlands town, is one of the masterpieces of 19th-century English literature. Though less popular than Jane Austen’s slices of penetrating wit, and less frequently adapted than Dickens’s teeming, socially engaged sagas, Middlemarch continues to exert its hold on readers. “It is one of the few English books written for grownup people,” wrote Virginia Woolf. There are many ways to understand that pithy assessment. One is that Eliot did not avoid exploring the consequences of disappointment: Dorothea’s poor choices in marriage; Dr Lydgate’s idealism and talent, so tarnished by compromise. Middlemarch stays with us because it has so much to say now: about politics, about social change, about science, about love; about the web of connections that binds people together in a community. BBC Radio 3 will on Sunday broadcast a series called Middlemarch Monologues – new dramas by writers including Tanika Gupta and Sabiha Mank that translate Eliot’s concerns into a modern context, touching on issues affecting the Midlands in our own time: the building of HS2, Black Lives Matter and Covid-19. The works are part of the programme for Coventry’s year as the UK’s City of Culture. That city, where Eliot went to school, provided her with a model for her fictional town, and its streets will also form the backdrop for Dash Arts’ immersive adaptation of the book, The Great Middlemarch Mystery, which will be staged early next month. The writers of this version have also chosen to modernise the novel, placing the action in 1982 – a moment, they argue, that echoes the social and political flux of the novel’s setting in the early 1830s. The specificity of Middlemarch to its locale is important. The Nuneaton-born Eliot was writing about a town in the middle of England – one that might seem marginal or on the edge of things (as in “the marches”, or the borderlands) – but that in fact demands to be seen as the centre of its world, and the opposite of peripheral in its calls on our attention. The novel, so intellectually rigorous, is often concerned with perspective: with who is looking at whom, and with what intent. When Will Ladislaw happens upon Dorothea at the Vatican, where she is on her unhappy honeymoon with her pedant of a husband, Casaubon, she is in a reverie, not looking at the ancient statue of the sleeping Ariadne she stands beside – she has turned away from the overwhelming carnal spectacle the city offers, since she is in denial about her own sensuality. At another moment the novel tells us, when we are asked to observe Dorothea weeping six weeks after her marriage, “If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel’s heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.” So the novel deftly and wittily reminds us that we are surrounded by personal tragedy, which can be glimpsed only fleetingly by our coarse minds, when gently steered towards it, by a writer of Eliot’s capabilities.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Middlemarch: a book for grownups | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/mar/18/the-guardian-view-on-middlemarch-a-book-for-grownups

3/19/2022,"Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has warned P&O Ferries it could face an unlimited fine, if its summary sacking of 800 British staff is found to have breached the law, as protests against the layoffs took place at ports across the country. Writing to the company on Friday, Kwarteng said he wanted to express, “in the strongest possible terms, the UK government’s anger and disappointment”. He highlighted the taxpayer support received by the firm, including through the furlough scheme, and suggested it did not appear to have followed the procedure required for large-scale redundancies. “It cannot be right that the company feels tied closely enough to the UK to receive significant amounts of taxpayer money but does not appear willing to abide by the rules that we have put in place to protect British workers.” In his letter, Kwarteng said failure to give sufficient notice of large-scale redundancies, via the Insolvency Service and the Redundancy Payment Service, “is a criminal offence and can lead to an unlimited fine”. However, it quickly emerged that Robert Woods, to whom Kwarteng’s letter was addressed, resigned as P&O Ferries’ chair in December last year. BEIS officials blamed the error on the fact that parent company DP World’s website had not been updated. Shadow transport secretary Louise Haigh said, “the behaviour of P&O Ferries is an absolute scandal and must not be allowed to stand. “The government have taken a full 48 hours to wake up to how outrageous this act was and all they’ve done is manage to write a letter to the wrong person complaining about the failure to give sufficient notice. They are missing the point. Businesses must not be given free rein to operate in this country while treating British workers with such contempt.” Ministers have come under mounting pressure to take action against P&O Ferries after Thursday’s layoffs. Boris Johnson’s official spokesman conceded on Friday that senior officials at the Department for Transport were informed of the company’s intentions on Wednesday evening, but did not disseminate the information widely because of commercial sensitivity. The RMT union’s general secretary, Mick Lynch, said: “The fact that the government knew the day before that a foreign owned company planned to cause major disruption to UK ports but did nothing to prevent it is shocking.” He said the union had “been overwhelmed by the widespread public and political support”, adding: “But there is still time to reverse this shameful decision and today we are presenting a plan of action which needs to be acted upon immediately and if necessary, the government should introduce enabling legislation to make it happen.” Transport secretary Grant Shapps sent a separate letter – also to the departed Woods – on Friday, warning the company the events of the last 48 hours have “fundamentally changed the way the British public feels” about P&O Ferries. Shapps said he would review all government contracts with the firm, and coastguards would be carrying out extra checks to ensure the safety of the firm’s vessels with their new agency staff. Trade unions leaders and politicians of all sides joined sacked P&O workers in Hull, Dover, Liverpool and Larne on Friday to protest against the company’s decision to replace all its crew with cheaper agency workers. The local Conservative MP, Natalie Elphicke, and the former shadow chancellor John McDonnell led a march in Dover with the leaders of the RMT and Nautilus International unions. They carried a banner that read “Save P&O jobs, save Britain’s ferries”. The demonstrations against P&O were backed by a strongly worded joint statement by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, and the bishop of Dover, Rose Hudson-Wilkin. “Ill treating workers is not just business. In God’s eyes, it is sin,” it said. The statement noted that P&O’s owners, DP World, had made record profits last year and added: “The move is cynically timed for a moment when world attention is on Ukraine. Done without warning or consultation it is inhumane, treats human beings as a commodity of no basic value or dignity and is completely unethical.” The firm’s treatment of its workers has intensified calls for “fire and rehire” – the practice of sacking staff only to employ people to do the same jobs on worse terms and conditions – to be outlawed. P&O Ferries said it now hoped to restore the first of its suspended ferry services “in the next day or two”, with the firm losing around £1m each day while the ships remain in port. The firm said it did not consult staff or unions on the “fundamentally changed crewing arrangements” before Thursday’s mass sackings, because the “process itself would be highly disruptive, not just for the business but for UK trade and tourism”. P&O said only a minority of the 800 staff on UK contracts who were sacked yesterday were fired by video message. A spokesperson said: “All affected crew who were working yesterday were notified face-to-face and in-person on board their vessels. “Virtual meetings were also held but only 261 of our 800 affected staff were on those calls.” Others were told by email or text message, P&O said, as well as individual phone calls. They added: “We know that for our staff this redundancy came without warning or prior consultation, and we fully understand that this has caused distress for them and their families.” P&O denied the Interforce security guards hired to evict staff “handled this difficult task with all appropriate sensitivity” and did not wear balaclavas, “nor were they directed to use handcuffs nor force”. Meanwhile, scrutiny has intensified over a £146m deficit in the seafarers’ industry pension scheme, owed by P&O Ferries and DP World. Johnson’s official spokesman said on Friday that ministers are investigating whether P&O Ferries had broken the law, describing the firm’s behaviour as “extreme”. “We expect companies to treat their employees fairly. It is only in extreme circumstances that employers need to make extreme decisions to secure the future of their businesses if all other avenues have failed, including negotiations between employer and employees. “We don’t believe this was the case for P&O staff,” he said, adding: “We are looking into this very carefully.”",News/Business,P&O Ferries could face an unlimited fine if sackings unlawful,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/18/po-ferries-could-face-an-unlimited-fine-if-sackings-unlawful
3/19/2022,"The United Nations has warned that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could trigger global famine, as Moscow’s Black Sea blockade delays crucial grain exports, and stoked fears of a deepening hunger crisis in countries such as Yemen and Ethiopia. The UN’s special rapporteur on the right to food, Michael Fakhri, warned on Friday of a global famine as the result of Russia’s invasion. “For the last three years, global rates of hunger and famine have been on the rise. With the Russian invasion, we are now facing the risk of imminent famine and starvation in more places around the world,” said Fakhri. He warned of long-term disruptions because of the ongoing fighting during planting season in Ukraine and Russia. He also warned of rising hunger in Russia as a result of any general sanctions that could affect the wider population rather than being targeted at individuals and businesses. “As with any military invasion, all countries must work in solidarity to address the urgent nutritional needs of all vulnerable people especially refugees, older persons, people with disabilities and children,” said Fakhri. “Food should never be weaponised and no country in the world should be driven into famine and desperation.” Meanwhile Ukraine’s grain exports through the Black Sea were reported to have stalled entirely, German media reported, quoting Jörg-Simon Immerz, head of grain trading at Germany’s largest agricultural trader BayWa. At least 100 ships are reportedly stranded in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov, prompting calls for Russia to open a “blue corridor” to allow their exit. The London-based International Grains Council (IGC) said the suspension of port activities was limiting Ukraine’s exports and that attempts to find other solutions were unlikely to satisfy the unmet demand. “Immediate threats are mainly centred on the disruption to export flows. Commercial Black Sea port loadings are currently suspended in Ukraine. Although there are efforts to increase exports via railway routes through the country’s western borders, overall volumes are likely to be limited,” it said in a report on Wednesday. The IGC downgraded its forecast for Ukraine’s grain exports by almost a quarter, from 62.8m tonnes to 47.8 million, compared with the forecast made last month. It said that while Russia’s ports had resumed activity in March, export volumes could still be limited by sanctions while other sources for grain exports were unlikely to be able to replace the gap left by Ukraine. The Moscow-based Institute for Agricultural Market Studies (IKAR) said Russia had temporarily banned grains exports to former Soviet states because of concerns at how quickly grains were being exported. Russia and Ukraine’s combined wheat exports are crucial to a number of countries, including Egypt, Turkey, Bangladesh and Iran, who get 60% of their grain imports from the two countries, according to the UN. The World Food Programme said the loss of access to grains and pulses from Ukraine could increase the cost of buying food by up to $23m a month, threatening already underfunded crises in Yemen, Ethiopia, Afghanistan and Syria. Last week, Ukraine banned the export of several grains, including barley, rye, oats and millet. David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme, appealed to donors to not ignore crises beyond Ukraine and warned that rising hunger could fuel further instability. “While you’re focused on Ukraine, please don’t neglect the Sahel, please don’t neglect Syria and Jordan, Lebanon. If you do, the consequences will be catastrophic,” he said. “Without food security, you’re not going to have peace. It’s just that simple.” “Is it fair for us to take food from children in Ethiopia to give to the children in Ukraine? No,” he said.",News/Global development,UN warns Russian blockade of Ukraine’s grain exports may trigger global famine,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/18/un-warns-russian-blockade-of-ukraines-grain-exports-may-trigger-global-famine
3/19/2022,"Rishi Sunak has promised that tax increases are “done”, as he dropped a heavy hint that he is preparing measures to tackle the rising cost of living in next week’s spring statement. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said this week that Sunak had announced more tax rises in two years – worth 2% of GDP – than Gordon Brown did in a decade. With the rise of 1.25 percentage points in national insurance contributions still due to come in April, the chancellor was keen to signal to Tory activists that there were no more nasty surprises ahead. Speaking at the Conservatives’ spring conference, he said: “I made this very clear at the budget in the autumn: that is done. We’ve made the difficult decisions that we have to make. My priority going forward is to cut taxes.” After weeks of mounting pressure for the Treasury to cushion the impact of rising prices, Sunak said he had “sympathy” for people struggling in the face of “global inflationary forces” and would consider taking action “where we can make a difference”. He is widely believed to be looking at a cut in fuel duty, perhaps of 5p, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent the cost of fuel at the pumps soaring. Such a measure would be enthusiastically welcomed by many backbench Conservatives, but some campaigners are warning against it. Analysis by the New Economics Foundation (Nef) shows just 7% of the benefit goes to the poorest fifth of households. The thinktank found that one-third of the savings would accrue to the wealthiest fifth of households. In absolute terms it would be worth an average of £1.80 a month to households in the bottom 20% of earners, and £8.20 a month to households in the top 20%. Alex Chapman, a senior researcher at Nef, said: “If your objective is to support those at the bottom of the income spectrum or those who are most vulnerable, a cut to fuel duty is an incredibly inefficient way to get support to that group.” Paul Tuohy, the chief executive of the Campaign for Better Transport, agreed. “Given the volatility of fuel prices, cutting fuel duty is not the best way to ease the cost of living crisis. It also isn’t targeted at those most in need,” he said. “More than a third of the lowest-income households have no car, and people on low incomes are much more likely than high earners to rely on buses. We would like to see moves to make public transport more affordable, which would have the added benefits of reducing our reliance on fuel and tackling climate change.” Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said he believed a 5p cut in fuel duty was now highly likely. “That works in terms of Tory politics. It is not the best policy in the world but politically it is well targeted,” he said. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has piled added pressure on Sunak to ease the cost of living in Britain. The Bank of England has said inflation could hit 10% later this year and it is unable to prevent rising energy prices from making people poorer, leaving it up to the chancellor to act. The Treasury had been keen to avoid next Wednesday’s spring statement being seen as a mini-budget, but Bell said it would be forced to respond. “It will be a big package,” he said. “The Treasury gave up on it being a non-budget about a month ago.” State benefits are due to rise by 3.1% in April at a time when inflation is expected to exceed 8%, and Bell said Sunak needed to make the increase more generous. “If he goes ahead with a 3.1% increase, that is effectively a £10bn cut in benefits, which is a big risk. Why would he take that risk?” Neil Shearing, the chief economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said he expected a £10bn package on Wednesday, including a cut in fuel duty, a temporary VAT cut on utility bills, a lifting of the freeze on tax allowance thresholds and extra help for customers with their energy payments. Noting that the pain from the cost of living crisis would really start to be felt next month when taxes and energy bills go up, Shearing said: “I can’t believe Rishi Sunak is not going to deliver something. In August there will be an announcement on the energy price cap in October and there is a good chance it will go up again. Things are going to get worse before they get better.” The independent Office for Budget Responsibility is likely to provide Sunak with the scope to act when it produces new forecasts for the public finances on Wednesday. Lower than expected unemployment means the OBR is set to reduce its estimate of the long-term damage from the pandemic, while higher inflation has increased the amount of money Sunak will get from freezing tax allowances. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said this week the Treasury had been expecting to get £8bn a year from the move but would actually receive £20.5bn.",News/Politics,"Priority is to cut taxes, says Rishi Sunak before spring statement",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/18/priority-is-to-cut-taxes-says-sunak-before-spring-statement
3/19/2022,"When Tupua Urlich – the first person to take the stand at a landmark Māori hearing on abuse in state care – is asked to talk about his upbringing, he puts his heads to his clasped hands and says he needs to take a minute. “This is an emotional thing to go through,” he says. “I don’t mind people seeing this because this is what we go through every day of our lives.” Urlich, of Croatian and Ngāti Kahungunu ki Heretaunga descent, was five when he was separated from his mother and seven siblings, and sent to live with a non-whānau [non-family] caregiver chosen by the state. “That’s when the gates of hell opened up,” he says. “I can tell you, I was far safer in those first five years of my life,” he tells the hearing. Over the next two years, in the early 2000s, he told the commission he was brutally beaten nearly every day. “I was a child at the mercy of a monster,” he says. “Beyond physical abuse, he was cruel. How anyone could deem him safe to take care of me I don’t understand.” After one beating, Urlich says his caregiver swung open the door to his room where he lay bleeding and said: “Oh yeah, your dad’s dead by the way”, then slammed the door closed. New Zealand’s royal commission into abuse in state and faith-based care is the largest and most complex royal commission the country has held. The independent investigation put in motion in 2018, is tasked with revealing the extent of abuse within the institutions designed to protect children, and its ongoing effects. Over the past two weeks, the commission has held its first publichearings dedicated exclusively to Māori, giving survivors an opportunity to highlight the racism and cultural disconnection they also faced at the hands of the state. In total, 25 people – a tiny fraction of the estimated 200,000 Māori survivors of abuse – took to the stand to testify. In the 1970s, most children taken into state care were Māori, and over-representation of Māori children in care has continued. According to the royal commission’s report, Māori today make up 69% of children in care and 81% of the children abused in care, despite accounting for only about 16% of the population. The commission estimates about 655,000 people have been in care settings in New Zealand since the 1950s, and up to 256,000 may have been abused. Their testimony was livestreamed, and transcripts will be published on the commission’s website. Urlich says being Māori, and raised in a system that separated him from his culture and knowledge is “modern day colonisation”. “The only time I saw reference to Te Ao Māori [the Māori world] was outside of the education centre in a child, youth and family building – there were koru patterns in the glass frostings of the meeting rooms,” Urlich says. “I deserved more than that.” The trauma of being deliberately separated from whānau, and Māori culture arises time and again during the hearings. Some survivors say it “was profoundly abusive in and of itself”, says Julia Spelman (Ngāti Hikairo), independent legal counsel assisting the commission. “And this challenges us to think about abuse in a broader way.” “Some survivors described hating being Māori, or of having their chance to be Māori taken away from them; of having experiences so painful that they do not feel able to reconnect with their identity and what it means to be Māori.” The pain of that severance has intergenerational effects, some survivors say. A woman of Sami, Navajo, Aboriginal and Māori descent was adopted by a Pākeha [European] family as a newborn, after doctors told her then-16 year-old mother that her baby was sick and the best thing to do was leave her at the hospital for staff to look after. The doctors then falsely listed her ethnicity as European on her birth certificate, says the woman, who is acknowledged as Ms AF. “I think they did this because Māori babies were less desirable for adoption.” “The moment my adoption happened was the minute I lost my legal Treaty rights as a Māori. This is the one thing that broke my heart.” Ms AF, who had been adopted into a religious household, was sent to a Catholic school, where she was physically abused. “The nuns would use canes, their hands or whatever they could get their hands on to beat us.” At age 18 when she fell pregnant, she was sent to a Catholic nun’s home for unwed mothers where she was put under duress to adopt her son out. “I had no advice provided to me. The next thing I know my son had disappeared. I returned to New Plymouth that day. I didn’t know that I could keep him.” For others, the state’s intervention set them on the path of criminality. Hohepa Taiaroa, 62, of Tuwharetoa descent, had his first interactions with social services aged 10, while struggling with the separation of his parents, and his mother’s new family. He started running away from home, and was sent to Kohitere boys training centre at 14 after he started stealing cars, and then Waikeria Borstal. “That was the beginning of my schooling on being a criminal, and the start of learning how to fight,” Taiaroa says. “Instead of learning Māori and other stuff we were supposed to learn, we learned how to steal, how to gamble, how to get ahead of everybody else in the system.” Taiaroa says he was intimidated and assaulted at the institutions, and reprimanded for speaking Māori. Because he was deemed “a runaway” he would frequently spend up to 23 hours in solitary confinement. “I never had a voice because my voice was these two things here, my fists. I couldn’t even say a full sentence. It was just yes, no, and that was it. That’s how much mamae [pain] and anger I had inside me.” Taiaroa spent time in prison during his adult years, and had his own children taken by the state. “I’ve lost three good families because of the violent way I was brought up in the system and the flow on effects on my whānau.” Towards the end of Urlich’s testimony, he is asked by commissioners what the state should be doing now for Māori children. “We can stop viewing children in isolation of their family,” he says. “If the whānau are not operating in a way that is safe or sustainable or nurturing for our tamariki [children] then do something about it, don’t just take away the children because guess what, Crown, you don’t have a nurturing, safe, loving environment yourselves.”",News/World news,"‘The gates of hell opened’: after decades, Māori survivors of state abuse are finally heard ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/the-gates-of-hell-opened-after-decades-maori-survivors-of-state-abuse-are-finally-heard
3/19/2022,"Rain pelts down as the monthly city markets opens its doors in Port Moresby, the capital of Papua New Guinea. Market sellers worry about the weather chasing potential shoppers away but organiser, Sylvia Pascoe is unfazed. She gets onto social media to encourage her thousands of followers to stave off the rainy day blues by coming to the markets for some hot Papua New Guinea coffee. Her perseverance and that of the mostly female sellers pays off when the sun creeps back out. Pascoe, who began the Port Moresby city markets, is passionate about creating opportunities for business owners and entrepreneurs, especially other women. In June, she will attempt to take her leadership to the highest level by contesting the country’s federal election. “I’m not the type of person that sees an issue and just walks away from it. I feel like if its in front of me and it needs to be done, I do it,” she said. Pascoe is one of four women nominated by one of Papua New Guinea’s most influential political figures, Sir Peter Ipatas, to run on the People’s party ticket; a political party he founded in 2006. The others include media executive Tania Bale, former top government bureaucrat Anne Bais, and business woman and consultant, Michelle Hau’ofa. Each woman will be a candidate in one of the four electorates that make up the Papua New Guinean capital. The announcement of Ipatas’s support for the women made last month, caused a stir, given how influential Ipatas has been in the backroom machinations that have seen prime ministers rise and fall in PNG. It was welcomed by many as a positive shift after the results of the 2017 elections, in which no women were voted in, making Papua New Guinea one of just three countries in the world to have no women in its parliament. “It’s not a a publicity stunt, it’s not a grab for headlines, it is genuinely something he has put a lot of thought and care into,” said Bale. “It is an incredible opportunity for us and an incredible honour for us to be mentored and come under the wing of governor Sir Peter Ipatas.” According to United Nation reports, Papua New Guinean women are disadvantaged in many areas of development, including politics; with PNG having had just seven female MPs in its nearly 50 years since independence, something the new People’s party candidates are aware of. “We haven’t had many women in parliament and currently we’ve had zero which has been a big motivator for us,” said Bale. “Hopefully, the steps we’ve taken will give fortitude to other women to step forward.” Sir Peter Ipatas has been in parliament for 25 years since becoming the governor of the Enga province. He is a political enigma always in the centre of power but never putting himself up to be a candidate for prime minister. In 2006, he founded the People’s party, which has been a major player in the formation of governments, including bringing the current prime minister, James Marape, into power. Sir Peter Ipatas is revered for being a visionary leader instrumental in reforms in education, health, and infrastructure. In education he is known as the father of the country’s “Free Education” policy, which sees provincial governments pay for student tuition fees. “We feel that the ladies are capable… or sometimes more capable of representing our people in parliament,” said Sir Peter while endorsing the four female candidates. The lack of women in PNG’s parliament has revived a debate about whether quotas, reserving seats in parliament for women, should be introduced. A recent proposal that would have seen five seats – one each in the Highlands, West Papua, East Papua, New Guinea Islands and Momase – reserved for women, was officially shelved last week, when the government announced that quotas would not be introduced in time for this election. “We could potentially work on getting those changes in the next parliament but certainly not for this one… We invited party leaders to share their views and opinions [about the proposal] but on record, we only heard back from two political parties,” said Julie Bukikun, the assistant resident representative for the United Nations development programme. For Pasoce, speaking as she surveys the stands at the markets, she is not interested in quotas, but hopes to make her way to parliament nonetheless. “I vehemently disagree with the reserved seating. I want to earn my place in parliament, fairly. I want the people to vote me in.”",News/World news,‘It’s not a publicity stunt’: the push to elect female MPs to PNG’s men-only parliament,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/19/its-not-a-publicity-stunt-the-push-to-elect-female-mps-to-pngs-men-only-parliament
3/19/2022,"The rattle of someone sliding open the changing room door is the cue to execute a discreet turn of the head, gaze firmly directed at the steam rising towards the bathhouse’s intricate wooden rafters. As it turns out, the precaution is unnecessary. The two bathers joining the Guardian in the restorative waters of a 140-year-old hot spring resort, or onsen, in the mountains of Japan’s Gunma prefecture were men. Despite being open to male and female bathers for all but two hours each day – when access is restricted to women – the historical baths seemed to be mixed in name only. Over the course of four long soaks, all of my fellow bathers were male. The absence of women seemed to confirm Japanese media reports that konyoku – mixed bathing – is at risk of becoming a cultural curiosity, especially when it requires participants to go naked. Many blame the rising menace of wani (crocodiles) – the nickname given to men who spend long periods immersed in the water, their eyes constantly scanning the room for female bathers. “We are at our wits’ end from day to day,” one onsen owner told the Asahi Shimbun of the constant fretting among operators over how to address the transgressions of some male bathers. Their lurking presence is making more women reluctant to bathe with men – even family members – and is forcing the industry and its government regulators to devise new ways to protect konyoku culture. An estimated 500 venues allow men and women to perform their ablutions in each other’s company, down from more than 1,200 in 1993. “The problem is men,” says Yasuhiko Kobayashi, a lawyer who has written a guide to the country’s best onsen. “There are cases in which men try to strike up conversations with women, asking them where they are from and so on. You tend to get more of this after they have drunk alcohol,” he tells the Guardian. Some have set up partitions so that, while men may be sharing the same water as their female counterparts, voyeurism is impossible. In places were semi-segregation is impossible, bathers are required to partially cover up – a restriction purists say diminishes the sense of freedom that comes with a long soak in mineral-rich spring water. That restriction doesn’t seem to be an issue at Sukayu, a huge outdoor hot spring resort in northern Japan, where men wear knee-length shorts and women yuami – loose shorts and a matching sleeveless top – as part of a government initiative to encourage mixed bathing. “I don’t have to worry about being ogled,” one female bather said. “I can just sit back and enjoy the onsen.” In a survey by regional authorities in north-east Japan – home to many hot springs – 75% of women who responded said they were put off by mixed bathing, but 81% said they no longer felt uncomfortable if all bathers were partially clothed. Other hot springs have followed suit, with one proprietor who recently introduced a clothing rule on a trial basis suggesting the change would become permanent since it had clearly deterred bathers with “perverse motives”. Another onsen in the south-west of the country saw the number of female bathers rise from 10% to 80% after it made covering up compulsory. “By encouraging the use of bathing garments, we’re hoping people’s concerns will be eased so they can again enjoy konyoku culture, irrespective of generation or gender,” an onsen industry official told the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper. Naked mixed bathing gained acceptance during the Edo period (1603-1868) and survived until 1890, when the country’s leaders imposed a ban in 1890, reportedly fearing it was sending foreign visitors – particularly puritanical Americans – the wrong message about the local population’s sense of propriety. It underwent a revival after the second world war, when the residents of cities destroyed in US air raids had no choice but to bathe wherever hot water was available, even if that meant stripping off in front of their neighbours. But official restlessness persisted: Tokyo banned konyoku among people aged over 10 in 1964 – the year it hosted the summer Olympics – and reduced the maximum age to seven in the 1990s. Kobayashi, who has sampled about 3,000 onsen over the past three decades, attributes the breakdown of bathing manners to a lack of consideration for other people that now afflicts wider Japanese society. “People think that if something is not actually prohibited, then they can do as they please,” he said. “When foreigners arrived in Japan in the late 1800s, mixed bathing was one of the things that really surprised them. But that was a time of tolerance and respect in Japan. It meant Japanese society was safe and peaceful. The decline of mixed bathing is proof that standards are declining.” The introduction of partitions and bathing wear requirements diminishes the value of what should be an innocent shared experience, he added. “It means that onsen are losing their individual charm. That’s a real shame.”",News/World news,‘Crocodiles’ could spell the end of Japan’s tradition of nude mixed bathing,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/crocodiles-could-spell-the-end-of-japans-tradition-of-nude-mixed-bathing
3/19/2022,"Today marks two years to the day that the call went out for New Zealanders who were travelling or living overseas to “return home”. In those strange, dangerous days the pandemic was threatening to unleash so many unknowns: how short was the transmission window? How effective were masks and ventilation? And what did hospitalisation and death look like in a first world country? There were early precedents – the tragedy unfolding in Italy for one – but for at least a month New Zealand was thinking along the same lines as the rest of the world. “Flatten the curve,” using progressive measures including physical distancing to simply slow the spread. Aside from a handful of (at the time) unknown epidemiologists like Prof Michael Baker there were few experts or commentators calling on the government to “stop the spread”. That was until 23 March when prime minister Jacinda Ardern made the most important decision of her career, and perhaps the most important decision any post-war prime minister has made: that night New Zealand would move to Alert Level 3 and two nights later to Alert Level 4, effectively locking down the country. Ardern appeared before the country and with persuasion and a good deal of humility made the case to “go hard and go early”, introducing a term that would unite the country for the next year and a half – “the team of 5 million”. The next day parliament met to pass $52bn in emergency spending, grant the Inland Revenue Department the power to remit interest on tax owing, and to freeze rents and prevent no-cause evictions for at least six months. Seven months later and New Zealand voters rewarded Ardern and her government with a historic MMP majority. Labour took true blue seats like Ilam in Christchurch. Riding a leftwing tide the Green’s Chloe Swarbrick took Auckland Central while the Māori party’s Rawiri Waititi took Waiariki. And yet, on current polling, Ardern and her government are dropping up to 10 points from this time last year, and even more if you take the election result as a benchmark. In the One News Kantar public poll National is registering at 39% support with Labour trailing at 37%. The last time National was polling ahead of Labour was before the pandemic. Granted, this is one poll – Labour is still ahead of National (just) in the latest Taxpayers’ Union-Curia poll and comfortably ahead in the Hui’s poll of Māori voters – but the trend is clear. The Labour government is gradually losing support. Why? The decline seems to puzzle the government’s diehards. National leader Chris Luxon’s first and seemingly only policy idea is to hit the tax cuts button, promising a change to the tax brackets and scrapping the top tax rate for the extremely wealthy. It makes little sense – do people earning over $180,000 really need a massive tax cut? – but the point is less in the detail than in what those details represent. A return to National’s core business, as a CEO might say, and a break from the Judith Collins era and its weird obsession with the obscure from Samoa to Tasmania to fat shaming to nuking one’s own colleagues. Luxon is, without wanting to extend the metaphor, promising a smooth landing for National voters. That leaves Labour in an uncomfortable position. Over the last four months the government has repeatedly departed from its core business, abandoning the Alert Level system and replacing it with the confusing Traffic Light system in December, wavering on mandates after the Canadian-inspired clown convoy made its way to Wellington, and hastily cutting fuel excise tax in a gift to Luxon and his argument that it’s possible to cut your way out of a “cost of living crisis” (where cut means cut taxes). This isn’t to say the government isn’t also undertaking necessary and excellent reform – subsidising public transport across the country is a move that the rest of the world is watching with keen interest – but triangulating, searching for a “third way” between irreconcilable positions is very much the politics of another era. If one can date the government’s decline 17 August 2021 is it. On that breezy winter Tuesday the prime minister announced the country would move to Alert Level 4 at midnight. Back then, public compliance was high, and the team of 5 million did its duty. That initial lockdown would drag into December as the Delta variant proved a tougher opponent than the initial coronavirus variant, yet compliance remained high with movement data indicating similar patterns to previous Level 4 and Level 3 lockdowns in Auckland. When the usual cast of conspiracists and losers turned out to protest the lockdown in August they could muster no more than 100 supporters. Yet six months later some members of that same pathetic cast managed to turn out thousands of people for the clown convoy to Wellington. How? What distinguished the country’s first extended lockdown in March 2020 from its second in August 2021 was that the first lockdown came with the social and financial support needed to sustain it. Alongside freezing tax interest, freezing rents and banning evictions came hundreds of millions of dollars in direct support to social service providers and a six-month mortgage holiday scheme for homeowners. A similar commitment to preventing hardship was absent in the August 2021 lockdown, and as Alert Level 4 and Alert Level 3 dragged on in Auckland stories were breaking that detailed exactly what that hardship looked like. In South Auckland, it was often high school students taking jobs as essential workers. This is what did in the government’s strong support from New Zealanders, allowing communities to fracture as hardship went unanswered and unsupported. You would find very few New Zealanders who strongly disagree with the government’s overall pandemic response. But for that response to work it needs the social and financial support to sustain it. Otherwise, people vote with their feet.

3/19/2022,"Afortnight after facing each other in the Women’s Super League, the two Manchester clubs came up against each other in the FA Cup. The WSL match was a tight affair, which City dominated and edged courtesy of a sublime chip from 20 yards out by Caroline Weir. With United sitting fourth in the WSL table and City fifth, the tie would be a tight one to call especially as league form naturally goes out of the window in any derby cup clash. Manchester City fans await the arrival of the teams, including Ellen White (below left) and Lauren Hemp (below right). Amongst the City fans waiting outside Leigh Sports Village were John (above centre right) and David (above centre left). John said: “It’s my first time I’ve come to watch this … yeah it’s usually the men’s team. This old man here now (David) has started to watch the women’s and he loves it. So hopefully it’s a blue win.” A mum with two children, the daughter is a City fan and the son is a United fan. When asked for a prediction of the score – daughter: I think 2-1. Son: err … 2-1 to United. Mum: I’m going 2-1 United. (Her City fan daughter groans). The match was broadcast live on BBC Two, with presenting duties being taken by Alex Scott (top right), Rachel Brown (middle left) and Willie Kirk (middle right). The team’s WSL match in October 2021 attracted a record peak audience of 1.1m on BBC One and there were also 114,000 live streams of the 2-2 draw on BBC Sport online. United started brightly, pressing and harrying their neighbours and took the lead after 13 minutes when captain Katie Zelem’s corner looped in at the far post. City’s attempts to get back into the game during the rest of the first half were stymied by United’s impressive defensive display with the visitors being restricted to a couple of half-chances. Some of the 2,335 fans who attended the match at the Leigh Sports Village. City made two changes at half-time with Vicky Losada and Jess Park making way for Hayley Raso and Caroline Weir and they made an instant impact, with Raso providing the cross which Lauren Hemp slotted home at the far post. The visitors continued to pile on the pressure and had their noses in front eight minutes later when Ellen White pounced on a weak header back to her keeper by United full-back Hannah Blundell, calmly rounded Mary Earps and slotted home. On the hour mark another United error led to another City goal when Earps allowed Weir’s left-footed shot to squirm under her and inside the near post. Khadija Shaw added a fourth in the 79th minute with her first touch after coming on, smashing the ball into the roof of the net from two yards out after Hemp’s shot was parried into her path by the United keeper. Manchester United’s Diane Caldwell picks the ball out of the net after White scored City’s second goal (top), Weir fires home the third and celebrates with fellow goalscorer Hemp (middle) and Shaw (above) celebrates scoring the fourth goal with teammates.

3/19/2022,"A gay rights activist from Kharkiv, Shchemur was killed during the Russian bombardment of the city centre, her colleagues at Kharkiv Pride said on Thursday. She was killed at the local territorial defence office where she volunteered, they said. “Elya was an activist and a patriot: she participated in all possible actions and democratic events of Kharkiv. Together with Elya, we went through three Kharkiv Prides and three women’s solidarity marches. Elya was actively engaged in human rights interventions and pride performances,” the colleagues said. “She inspired and motivated not only our team but all volunteers around. People followed her into her struggle for freedom and equality. And when she smiled, everyone smiled back. Elya was one of the first Kharkiv Pride volunteers that joined the Kharkiv defence office. She was brave and courageous. A patriot and a hero. And this is how we will remember her and never forget. Shvets, an actor, was killed in a rocket attack on a building in the Kyiv, according to the theatre company of which she had been a member since 1980. The performers talked of their “irreparable grief” as they announced the news of her death on Thursday, and vowed never to forgive the Russian forces who had invaded Ukraine. The Kyiv Post, an English-language news outlet, referred to her death as “murder”. According to an obituary in the showbusiness magazine Variety, Shvets had been honoured with a “merited artist of Ukraine” award for her work in theatre and was known for her performances at the Ternopil music and drama theatre and the Kyiv Theatre of Satire, as well as for her work in several Ukrainian feature films. The American was on one of his regular visits to Ukraine to spend time with his Ukrainian partner, Ira, who has multiple sclerosis, when the Russians struck. Hill, originally from Mahtomedi, Minnesota, stayed behind even as the bombs fell around him in the northern city of Chernihiv. Those Russian bombs eventually took his life, his relatives have now learned, though it is more or less all they have been able to piece together about his death. “He was not going to leave Ira’s side in her condition. Jim was in Ukraine this time because he had gotten medicine from the United States and had found a doctor in Chernihiv that would treat her,” Hill’s sister Katya told CNN, describing her brother as the “helper that people find in a crisis”. She said Ukrainian police had told them he died during artillery fire, but the US embassy had provided no specifics. The family have been unable to find out where his body is and have been equally unsuccessful in contacting Ira’s family. “The hardest thing that we’re going to have to go through is not having that kind of closure,” Katya said.",News/World news,Gay rights activist among latest known victims of Ukraine war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/gay-rights-activist-among-latest-known-victims-of-ukraine-war
