5/14/2022,"Morcheeba’s signature rich, mellow music became the soundtrack of the suburban homes and chillout rooms of the late 90s and early 00s. The trio – Kent brothers Paul and Ross Godfrey and Londoner Skye Edwards – formed in 1994 and went on to make some of the most definitive records of the era, including trip-hop infused Who Can You Trust?; Big Calm, with its breakout hit The Sea; and Fragments of Freedom. Now touring as a duo, Skye and Ross are releasing Blackest Blue: The Remixes next week. This photograph was from our first proper shoot – we were under the Westway, near Portobello Road in London, and it was taken by Danny McLewin who did the artwork on our first two records. At the time we were doing everything I’d ever wanted as a kid – piling into a van with friends and playing gigs. I thought Skye was really cool when I met her at a party. She had a shaved head with a bleached flower on top, and I thought, wow, she looks original. We shared a joint with my friend Justin, and got on straight away. Me and her went on to form Morcheeba, and she had two children with Justin. As fateful meetings go, it was up there. A lot of the early days of the band were a complete blur. I was 18 when things took off, and marijuana was a big part of my life. There are whole tours that I don’t remember, but there are some moments that stick out – like playing our first Later ... With Jools Holland. Paul Weller was on. Afterwards, he came over and asked whether I had any weed. I was like, yeah! So I went on his tour bus and smoked a spliff. It was amazing being let into this other world. To break into the industry and live in London – the capital of cool – was impressive. We weren’t interested in being famous, though. I hated the thought of us being too recognisable, and in the 00s it was almost getting to that point, so it scared us a bit. We soundtracked people’s births, and holidays in Thailand. We also got called a “coffee‑table band” and I never knew if that was offensive or not. What’s wrong with coffee tables? I think the press was annoyed that we were the antithesis of the Britpop era with its big energy and characters. In 2003, my brother asked Skye to leave the band – a decision I didn’t really agree with. It was a chaotic time, we were all exhausted after touring so much and we just needed a break. It was more about personal transitions than a deep disagreement. Even though I wasn’t happy, it benefited us to have some time apart. Skye and I eventually met again, and we wouldn’t be where we are now if it wasn’t for that period. It’s like having a partner: you split up then meet again, get married and have kids. Now our friendship is much deeper. When you’re young you’re self-obsessed. You don’t think about feelings and commitments. But these days I really appreciate her. We’ll have a Sunday lunch together with our families, and we just have a lot of fun – whether it’s renting a boat and going on Lake Geneva, or diving off cliffs. Recently we did a private show for this multibillionaire at a hotel in Monaco. After the gig, I stood with Skye and her husband by the swimming pool chatting. Out of nowhere, she pushed us both in. She said it was “just too tempting to resist”. I had to get a seven-hour taxi back, sopping wet. In spite of that, Skye and I trust each other completely. We were both very introverted people. For that type of personality it takes a long time to form a bond – 25 years later, it’s stronger than ever. The dress was from Camden market – I knew I wanted the shot to be bright and colourful. Mostly I was trying to hide my tummy; I was five months pregnant so I had to hold a guitar in front of the bump! On the day we signed our first record contract, I wore a baggy T-shirt as I thought the label wouldn’t want to invest in a band with a pregnant singer. My main goal was to make sure Ross and Paul knew that I wouldn’t let them down, that I’d keep Morcheeba going. I was in the studio until my due date, and my son Jaega came on tour when he was eight months old. He’d hang out on the “junk bunk” where bags would normally go. It wasn’t very kiddy friendly, but for as long as I could, I wanted to be one of the boys – one who just happened to have a kid with them. I first met Ross in 1994 at a house party in Greenwich that my best mate, Julie, invited me to. She called and said: “I’m meant to be meeting this guy Danny McLewin – make sure you get there at 11pm, cos I don’t want to be there on my own.” I said, “Sure!” I got there at 11pm, but Julie didn’t show up for another hour. The only other people there that early were Ross and his friend Justin. Ross was skinny and had long hair in a ponytail; he was quite cute, and his friend was tall and handsome. I thought, who are these cool-looking dudes? I went over and asked them for some skins, and we just started chatting. I got both of their numbers and started dating Justin. It was Justin who first told Ross that I could sing. I was like: “Why did you do that? I can’t sing!” He persuaded me to go round to Ross’s house in Dalston with my guitar, and I played some songs that I’d written. Ross said: “I can’t hear you, can you sing louder?” I said: “No! This is how I sing!” When things started taking off for us, we toured for months on end. I’d take the herbal remedy valerian before I performed as I’d get so nervous – and I still do now. Once I came off stage in LA to find George Michael in our dressing room. He was a fan, and did a cover of Tape Loop which nobody heard, sadly. Madonna came to one of our shows in the US. She said she wanted physical tickets so she didn’t have to queue up and say: “I’m on the guest list, my name’s Madonna.” We had a lot of fun, but we also had our moments, shall we say. In 2003, they decided to leave me. It all sounds very Spinal Tap! But for seven years Ross and I didn’t speak. Morcheeba carried on with different singers, and while my husband [bassist Steve Gordon] carried on following their career, it was too weird for me. Like seeing your ex with a new wife. Then in 2009, by total chance, I saw Ross across the road in Shepherd’s Bush. I shouted, “All right, Ross!” and gave him a huge hug. Later on my manager called to say that Ross and Paul wanted to meet up. “I was like, why would they want to do that? They hate me? I hate them?” He said: “Actually they don’t hate you, they’d like to speak to you.” Ironically, we had our reunion in a restaurant called Julie’s in west London. We got drunk and thought, let’s give it another go. Paul eventually left as he didn’t like touring, but Ross and I have been together since. Compared with the 90s, Ross is more mellow; happier and calmer. But the main change for me, looking at these pictures, is my breasts. They look a bit different. First-pregnancy breasts versus four-kids-later, 50-year‑old breasts. There’s nothing left of them!",Lifestyle/Life and style,Morcheeba look back: ‘A lot of the early days were a complete blur – weed was a big part of it’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/may/14/morcheeba-look-back-early-days-a-complete-blur-weed-was-a-big-part-of-it
5/14/2022," Beethoven’s music for cello and piano is not a rarity, but four new recordings in the past year alone is surely an exception. First came veteran cellist Yo Yo Ma, giving seasoned poetry to the five sonatas with the pianist Emanuel Ax (Sony) 40 years after the duo’s first recording. Next (on Avie) was Jennifer Kloetzel, one-time cellist of the Cypress Quartet, with Robert Koenig on a period Blüthner piano: admirably inquisitive and vigorous in the complete cello works, which include three sets of variations and the horn sonata, Op 17, that Beethoven arranged for cello. The latest recording, of the sonatas only (out on digital; on CD next month), is from Alisa Weilerstein, top among mid-career players, with her regular collaborator, pianist Inon Barnatan (Pentatone). The test piece for anyone sampling these excellent sets is the best known sonata, No 3 in A major Op 69, in which piano and cello find full equality. A peerless technician, Weilerstein embraces both the expansive lyricism and fragile intensity of this work, the singing melodies contrasted with explosive “middle period” drama. She is compelling, too, in the Op 102 sonatas, the first (No 4 in C major) knotty, mysterious and condensed, the second (No 5 in D major) apparently more straightforward, with its tender central movement theme, but pointing towards the adventures of the composer’s late style. The fourth new Beethoven set, again of the complete works, is an exhilarating addition, from Sung-Won Yang (who recorded the complete Beethoven in 2007) and pianist Enrico Pace (on Decca, only available digitally in the UK). At the moment this is the set that draws me, but I may change my mind.  Ready or Not by the Portland, Maine ensemble Palaver Strings (Azika) celebrates string ensemble works from the Renaissance to the present, all by female composers. It opens with the baroque-inspired Concerto Grosso by Grażyna Bacewicz (1909-69). The Venetian lutenist, singer and composer Maddalena Casulana (c1544-90) is represented by a string version of her soulful madrigal Morir non può il mio cuore (My heart cannot die). In Lagrime mie by Barbara Strozzi (1619-77), the mezzo-soprano Sophie Michaux expresses the lament’s fierce power. A lovely, jazzy elegy, Fear the Lamb, by Chicago composer Akenya Seymour, remembers the short life of the American civil rights icon Emmet Till. With Irish-inspired folk fiddling to close, the disc ends on a high.

5/14/2022,"Full disclosure. I don’t like Steve Coogan. But when the Guardian asked me to interview the controversial funnyman, I jumped at the chance – and not just because I’ve been replaced by a younger presenter on the BBC’s magazine show This Time, and have time on my hands. I have arranged to meet Coogan for lunch and let him select the venue. It’s a measure of the man that he chooses a location minutes from his house and over two hours from mine. First impressions are not good. I’m struck by how slight Coogan is. Although we look similar, Coogan cuts an altogether frailer figure – his shoulders noticeably narrower and he stands, what, two inches shorter than me? Then again, that may be his posture, crumpled by years spent hunching over a laptop computer or looking down on people (Coogan is leftwing). His head is also wider at the top than mine and his hair isn’t very good. He is wearing a cream shirt, under a thicker shirt or light jacket – a “shacket”, which I have to concede is a good word. I find myself thinking of other composite clothes – a hoodigan, trorts, a scat, jeggings, before remembering jeggings already exist. We peruse the menus. Is he pleased I’m interviewing him for the Guardian and not, say, the Daily Mail? “I don’t particularly like the Guardian or the Daily Mail,” he says. “There are writers at the Guardian I like. It’s just their ‘witty’ columnists I find profoundly unfunny.” I’ll have to take his word for it. I don’t actually read the Guardian, having never been able to get past the sheer smugness of its typeface. “Is there anything the Guardian doesn’t want us to talk about?” he asks. I shake my head. “If you want to express an opinion, they’ve asked that you stick to identity politics and wild swimming. That’s their safe space, their comfort blanket.” The waiter arrives. I order the beef burger, described on the menu as the “ham” burger [sic]. Coogan orders the plant-based burger. Is this a metaphor for Coogan’s attempts to look like something he’s not? I ask him why he doesn’t order the beef burger, which is the same price and nicer. Coogan shifts uncomfortably and changes the subject. “I’ve heard good things about your live shows,” he says, referring to my national Stratagem tour, which has garnered extremely warm responses. He’s trying to butter me up by saying my show is fantastic – the oldest trick in the book – but my journalistic skills mean I don’t take the bait. Besides, I have a job to do. Like all journalists, my main objective is to trick him into spilling something that will either get him cancelled or a regular column in the Daily Mail. So I fix him with a glare. Why does he bang on about press regulation? Surely the government should play no role in the regulation of the press? Coogan rubs his eyes as if I’m the stupid one. “As the late, great [ex-Sunday Times editor] Harold Evans – frequently and rightly held aloft as the embodiment of campaigning ethical journalism – once said: ‘The misrepresentation of Leveson’s main proposal is staggering. To portray his main proposal for statutory underpinning as state control is a gross distortion.’ Most journalists didn’t bother to read the Leveson proposal because it was easier to just watch Newsnight to churn out their opinion pieces …” This may rank as one of the unfunniest things Coogan has ever said. “I’m talking about independent press regulation,” he drones. “Do we really want people like [ex-Daily Mail editor] Paul Dacre, who received gargantuan amounts of money from the EEC for his country estate where poshos and nouveaux can pay to shoot anything that moves, while actively campaigning to eliminate the very institution he’s taking money from?” It dawns on me Coogan is using this entire exercise as a platform to air his demented views. “Have it your way,” I think, and reel him in by questioning him over the recent criticism of Ken Loach, #MeToo – and how he can reconcile the lurid tabloid stories from his tawdry past. I also touch on his enormous house – and whether he could be accused of champagne socialism. Three perfectly placed banana skins – on which he’ll surely slip only to land in a very large cow pat, leaving him caked in cow shit and bits of banana. I’m salivating at the prospect of bringing down this pompous arse. But as I lean forward to feign interest in Coogan’s deranged ramblings, my elbow somehow rests on my Dictaphone, pressing the pause button, meaning I fail to record any of his answers. A shame, because almost everything he says for those 20 minutes is cancel gold dust. We split the bill. The Guardian has given me a modest budget to cover lunch but I’ve spent almost all of it on egg sandwiches and crisps at the service station. I’ll be buggered if Coogan’s going to fill his face on my dime. Later this year, Coogan will be playing Sir Jimmy Savile in a BBC One drama, The Reckoning, about the disgraced broadcaster and jogger. Most of us will find a perverse enjoyment in watching Coogan drive his good name into a wall by associating his brand with Savile. Why on earth does he think it sensible to play such an odious man? “It’s just a role,” he shrugs. “Dominic West played Fred West, a multiple murderer. David Tennant played Dennis Nilsen. He killed men and ate them. Nilsen, not Tennant, I mean.” Coogan is currently starring in Channel 4’s Chivalry, a comedy-drama (or “dramedy” or “coma”), dealing with post #MeToo politics; something he has no right to speak on. Last time I checked, he wasn’t even a woman. Maybe he is? It would explain the frail physique, in which case I fully support his right to speak out. “Don’t you feel like you’re playing with fire?” I ask. “I’ve had my car and hair egged for making #MeToo jokes before now.” He thinks for a second. “While some think humour trivialises important issues, I think it can sugar the pill and allows people to open up to discussion they wouldn’t otherwise have. It creates a safer space where …” I’m not even going to write the rest of the sentence. It’s absolute twaddle. Coogan once personally described me as a small-minded Little Englander; the apotheosis of everything he loathed about England. I’m therefore surprised when he invites me on to his home, a large country pile with its own bluebell meadow that he’s rewilding. Groan. As he shows off his integrated coffee maker, I look round casually to see if he has any shit ornaments or something to slag off, but a lot is similar to my own house. A Bafta trophy sits on a shelf. “Yeah, I’ve scooped seven or eight down the years, plus a few nominations.” His faux-casual boasting is painfully transparent. The guy probably has every award and nomination indexed in a fucking ledger somewhere. “Then there’s the two Oscar nominations for Philomena back in 2014 – one for writing, another for producing.” “Except it’s quite a long time since you’ve been nominated in either of those categories, isn’t it?” I needle. On the table sprawls a copy of today’s Guardian. As is the left-leaning Guardian’s wont, they are running a story about Boris Johnson’s lockdown parties, when they could have been running stories about how he was getting on with the job. Coogan chuckles a horrible chuckle. “The fact that these spineless Conservative MPs are caught between a rock and hard place – unsure whether to ditch or support Boris to save their skin – is frankly delicious, and puts a spring in my step every morning. I get a warm, fuzzy feeling just thinking about it.” What an unpleasant man. Most of us get a warm, fuzzy feeling from roasting marshmallows over a fire, watching a labrador chase a stick in the home counties or espying David Cameron nibble some of Alex James’s cheese at a Chipping Norton fete. But not Coogan. He revels in the discomfort of his enemies. I feel sorry for him. In fact, I don’t. I want to give him a clout. If I did, it would get an even bigger round of applause than those Hollywood liberals gave Will Smith. “Why don’t you stick to comedy?” I ask. “Why don’t you stick to broadcasting?” he counters. “You’re on tour pontificating about things you know nothing about – life coaching or whatever.” “I’m a broadcaster,” I reply. “Pontificating about things we know nothing about is what we do. Why do you think we all have podcasts?” Besides, life coaching is something I know about. Stratagem (or New Ways of Thinking in a Post-Covid World) is a life-management system that improves the quality of people’s lives in association with bet365 and P&O. Simply Google “positive reviews of Alan Partridge Stratagem” and you’ll see reams of reviews extolling a thoroughly enjoyable evening where I educate, inform and entertain (something the BBC used to do). He wanders over to look out of the window at his massive garden. My chance to lob another grenade. “Look at this place. You’re a champagne socialist!” He shifts uncomfortably, hopping from one foot to the other – although he might just need the toilet. “I prefer to think of myself as a Tennent’s Trotsky,” he grins, batting away my metaphorical grenade with a metaphorical badminton racket. It is a lame joke, unfunny and weak, and clearly designed to deflect. Coogan’s accent swerves between unreconstructed northern and reconstructed received pronunciation, from Hilda Ogden Mancunian to George Osborne, depending on whom he’s trying to impress. “Yeah, well, you never sound like you’re from Norwich,” he counters. “I’ve literally never heard anyone from East Anglia with anything like your accent.” The two aren’t remotely comparable. A Norfolk accent is broadcasting anthrax, and left me with no choice but to employ a dialect coach who trained me to permanently drop it, through intense tutoring and very small electric shocks. “Coogan, you haven’t answered the question.” I repeat in full: “Look at this place. You’re a champagne socialist!” Coogan sits, head in his hands. “Alan, what you don’t understand is – I don’t have all the answers. I doubt things. To write good drama, good comedy, you need to embrace doubt and paradox. The truth comes from the conflict of the human heart. I’m creative.” The arrogance! The only other person I’ve heard describe themselves as creative is my accountant and he’s in prison now. “I’m just trying to figure things out,” he continues. He looks close to tears, so I go over and hold him in my arms. “I don’t think Little Englanders are all bad,” he murmurs. “They have community, an innate sense of decency.” He holds my hands in his and kisses me. It is full on. Tongues, noises, the lot. After two or three minutes, I push him away. “What are you doing?!” I screech. “I’m sorry. I can’t help it.” “Right that’s it,” I sneer. “I’m going to tell everyone.” Coogan has fallen for it hook, line and sinker. I flattered him and was kind to him, knowing he’d try to kiss me. It’s the oldest journalistic trick in the book. “I’m sorry, I just thought we had a connection.” “I think I’d better go.” “Yes. Sorry about the kiss thing at the end.” As I drive back to East Anglia – Fleetwood Mac blaring over the car stereo – I can’t stop laughing. If only Coogan was on social media, I could slag him off some more and make an inference if he didn’t respond, just as I’m sure this article will get slagged off in the comments below. And although it pains me to admit it, he is quite a good kisser.  Alan Partridge is a broadcaster, newscaster, sportscaster, podcaster and thoughtcaster, based in Norfolk. He is currently on tour.

5/14/2022,"Imagine a hundred elite athletes racing to a cliff edge and leaping over, not to their doom but to exhilarating flight. The opening of Richard Strauss’s Don Juan, Op 20, should sound like that, and unless disaster strikes in this most fiendish of works, usually does. In the hands of the Leipzig Gewandhaus orchestra and its chief conductor, Andris Nelsons, the eruption of energy was on a different scale, adrenaline palpable, impact electrifying. The floor vibrated, a novelty in the unyielding acoustic of the Barbican. This is not a matter of hyperbole, though for once let’s allow some: this was my concert of the year so far, in repertoire that does not always appeal to me. More, it reflects Strauss’s absolute authority – even in his mid-20s when he produced this show-off piece – in getting the effect he wants from an orchestra. The strings kickstart the action in a tiny upward flurry, like an intake of breath, violins galloping from lowest note to high. Instantly the full orchestra lets rip with a noisy, propulsive fanfare motif: the libertine, his fate sealed, is at wild, erotic play. By the end, he is ruined, the hushed conclusion a sober whisper. Every orchestra performs this work. Why was this better? History plays a part. Named after the city’s “garment house” trading hall, with Felix Mendelssohn once its music director, the Gewandhaus has achieved rare continuity, even through the GDR years. Tradition can be a burden too, but not here. Brass is pure-toned, willing to roar but never rasp. Woodwind playing is alive with character. The string sound is rich, but fresh and acute, especially in Also sprach Zarathustra. This overblown work, all about nature and Nietzsche, might be less than the sum of its nine parts, yet it showcases the colours of a large orchestra, from double-bass rumbles to crazily skittering fugue, louche, cafe-style waltz, tinkling glockenspiel and big bell. If this is philosophy, I’ll have more of it. Tuesday’s event was the second in a two-part Strauss Project (now on European tour). It should have been four, but Nelsons’s other orchestra, the Boston Symphony, cancelled. So too did Yuja Wang as soloist in the youthful Burleske. Anyone thinking her replacement, the Austrian pianist Rudolf Buchbinder, might lack her dazzle would be wrong. Requiring absurd technical wizardry – can anyone play it without a few smudges or fudges? – this mini-concerto is disdained as froth by some, but the forces here, especially the witty and acerbic Buchbinder, made it worth the encounter. Since it is now mandatory to comment on Wang’s apparel, in her absence I should say that Buchbinder, with his grey silken socks and black velvet slip-ons, had his own pizzazz. Because of Scotland’s rules on face covering indoors, only relaxed in mid-April, the Scottish Chamber Orchestra was late to confirm its May concerts in Edinburgh and Glasgow: notably, the world premiere of a major SCO choral commission from its associate composer, Anna Clyne. It was part of a programme of British works conducted by Andrew Manze, who started out as a baroque violinist but has now proved himself gifted in this homegrown repertoire of the past century. The opener was Grace Williams’s Sea Sketches (1944). “Anyone know this piece?” Manze asked, expecting the answer “No”. My hand, almost alone and smugly, shot up, based on a full week’s knowledge after a lifetime of ignorance. I heard Britten Sinfonia playing it seven days earlier. On Monday I could hear it again, when Bath Festival Orchestra performs it at the city’s Roman baths. The more airings the better. Gusty and atmospheric, it set the mood for Clyne’s The Years, to a text by the American playwright Stephanie Fleischmann. Clyne’s impulse came from lockdown, but the reach is greater: an exploration of the loops and layers of time. Choral and orchestral lines mirror each other, overlapping, interweaving, expanding. Clyne cleverly provides the singers (the excellent SCO Chorus) with rewarding vocal writing, leaving astringency to the orchestra – as in the thunderous, manic second part or the striding expanse of the third to the words “find something lost in the sky”. This absorbing piece deserves a place in the repertoire. The concert’s second half featured the rising-talent violist Timothy Ridout, who played Britten’s anguished Lachrymae (1950) with sensitive support from the SCO. Then came Vaughan Williams in his 150th anniversary year. His Flos Campi (1925) – the title, “flower of the fields”, comes from the biblical Song of Solomon – is a rhapsodic outpouring, viola surging with and against orchestra and ecstatic chorus. Whoever thought Vaughan Williams a bit of a pastoral retrograde should hear this. Not unknown but not often played in concerts, it’s mad, bizarre and glorious.

5/14/2022,"The decision to delay a ban on supermarket offers, including “buy-one-get-one-free” deals on junk food, could “blow a hole” in the government’s obesity strategy, a former health minister has warned. Amid rising concern about food costs, it emerged on Friday that the government will delay a ban on multibuy deals for foods deemed unhealthy or fattening. It will also pause plans to ban pre-watershed TV advertising for foods high in fat, salt or sugar. It is understood that the prime minister, Boris Johnson, decided to delay the implementation of the policies by at least a year – and potentially scrap them altogether – after chairing a ministerial meeting to find ways to alleviate the cost of living crisis on Wednesday. Lord Bethell, a former health minister, piloted measures to ban multibuy deals before he was sacked in last year’s reshuffle. He said failures to stop people eating junk food will increase the number of people needing NHS treatment. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I am concerned that it will blow a hole in the obesity strategy. That has a massive follow-on effect on all of our health targets. “More people are getting cancer due to obesity-related effects. So the cancer 10-year plan, the extra five years of longevity and many more of our health targets are damaged by this. “All of this illness that is caused by [being] overweight from junk food is being carried by the NHS and by the taxpayer. “We do need to account for all of the costs of the obesity crisis in this country, and it is one way of mitigating those costs without actually banning things or taking more extreme measures.” The government published its strategy to tackle obesity in July 2020, noting that one in three children leaving primary school were overweight or obese. There was also a link between higher death rates with people who were obese and Covid-19. Bethell said he did not think parliament would let the block on multibuy deals to go through. “Parliamentary practicalities are that it will be extremely difficult to return to these measures before the next election,” he said. “I’d like to take the government at its word, but naturally I am concerned that this is backing off the obesity strategy top to bottom.” The Department of Health and Social Care said the ban on multibuy promotions would now come into effect in October 2023, while the ban on TV adverts before 9pm would be delayed to January 2024. The move has been criticised by health campaigners. Jamie Oliver, a longtime campaigner for healthy eating, said Johnson needed to show “real leadership” and stop making excuses for not forging ahead with the national anti-obesity strategy. “This is a wasted opportunity and it starts to erode the whole obesity strategy,” he said. “Policies like restricting junk food advertising to kids are crucial for levelling up and [are] popular with the public. “Parents and kids don’t want to hear any more excuses from the government. I really hope the prime minister proves me wrong and shows real leadership to give young people a healthier and fairer future.” The public health minister, Maggie Throup, said the government was still determined to tackle the problem of childhood obesity. “Pausing restrictions on deals like buy-one-get-one-free will allow us to understand its impact on consumers in light of an unprecedented global economic situation,” she said.",News/Society,Delay to junk food ads ban could ‘blow a hole’ in UK obesity strategy,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/may/14/delay-to-junk-food-ads-ban-could-blow-a-hole-in-uk-obesity-strategy
5/14/2022,"Having rolled the dice on an untested director of cricket in Rob Key, the England and Wales Cricket Board has kept gambling. Ben Stokes might have had only one first-class game as captain but he is a very popular and highly regarded player, and has already shown encouraging confidence in his leadership and his decision-making. I think he can be an excellent leader for this England Test team, but my instinct was that he would benefit from having an experienced coach beside him, someone who could make sure the weight of his job does not become too much of a burden and impact his performances. Instead the dice have been rolled once again. Brendon McCullum knows the ropes having been a captain himself and hopefully he will shoulder some of that workload, even if he has never coached a first-class team. But his appointment is another risk and though there will be a lot of excitement about the potential of the Test team’s new leadership, there are also a couple of obvious criticisms. Andrew Strauss said McCullum “knocked it out the park” in his interview and he is not a man prone to making big statements, so I have no doubt the New Zealander was impressive. But there will be a lot of coaches out there, well qualified people with experience across different teams and formats, wondering how someone with such a slender CV got the role, particularly given some of the people he was apparently competing with. Sometimes, as we perhaps also saw with the appointment of Key, a decision is made not to fixate on the credentials of a potential appointment, and it often helps to be friends with the right people. McCullum has simply not done a lot of coaching, which is extraordinary because he has been given an absolutely massive position in world cricket. At a time in the English game when it feels so much is on the line, the Test team has been put into the hands of people with huge potential but no experience. Strauss said it was positive that McCullum, Stokes and Key share a vision of how they like cricket to be played. This may prove to be a huge strength, but it is also true that some successful organisations deliberately select management teams with different personalities within them, to try to make sure they have all bases covered. We all hope that these will prove inspired decisions, but it remains to be seen. Whatever McCullum’s coaching experience, he has a record of taking a limited pool of players and getting the most out of them, of establishing a gameplan, getting buy-in from those around him and delivering results. I remember the first time I came across him, when I was on my last international tour in 2002. We played a match in Queenstown and the wicket was so green you could not distinguish it from the rest of the square. It was a low-scoring affair and he came out as a 20-year-old and played like it was a T20, putting together a couple of brief but eye-catching innings. He became a prolific batter and in time an excellent leader, culminating in the 2015 World Cup where he was credited – along with some highly skilled bowlers, which a captain always needs – with introducing a different way of thinking in one-day cricket, which can be formulaic. Eoin Morgan then took over England’s white-ball team and basically nicked the template from him, with incredible success. As a result most people would associate McCullum with the white-ball reset and here he is overseeing the longer format. How will his approach to the short-form game – go out, have fun, take the positive option – translate to Test cricket? I have never worked with a coach who does not want to have fun, but when it is the third day of a match in Kolkata, it is 34C and you have been in the field for four sessions, the game is not so much fun as sheer hard work. There are different styles of Test cricket: it can be attritional or fast-paced, it ebbs and flows, you have to be focused yet relaxed, the ball can swing and it can spin. Technique is important, as is method. You can be inspirational, you can be a great bloke, create fantastic plans and blueprints, but a coach must also work patiently to improve players’ technique and concentration. This will not be news to McCullum, whose New Zealand side had quality batters prepared to bat time, to get the shine off the ball, which allowed him to come in lower down the order and play with freedom. And he will know, as everyone does, how badly England need players with good technique who can bat at the top of the order and put in the hard work. The decision to move Joe Root down a place from No 3 opens up another space there. It always seemed that when Joe moved up it was with some reluctance and McCullum will want his best players in their best positions and their best form. But if he could have stepped up to three it would have really helped the team because of their lack of reliable top-order batters. Stokes’s move to six is more encouraging: it should play to his strengths and allow him to release the handbrake, be the dominant player who can take a game by the scruff of the neck. Key, McCullum and Stokes come together with England at a low ebb and surely the only way is up. Fans have realistic expectations but will want to see young players build on their experience and learn from their mistakes, Zak Crawley showing a bit more consistency, Ollie Pope looking less anxious, a nucleus of a successful side coming together. If they can deliver that, improved results should follow – and that will be when the fun starts.",Sport/Sport,Brendon McCullum inexperience could be a risk too far for England Test team | Mark Ramprakash,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/14/brendon-mccullum-inexperience-risk-too-far-england-test-team
