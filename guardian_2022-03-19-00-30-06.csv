3/19/2022,"Vladimir Putin has praised Russian “unity” over what the Kremlin is calling its special operation in Ukraine during a rare public speech at the national stadium in Moscow on Friday. “The country hasn’t seen unity like this in a long time,” Putin said, addressing a large flag-waving crowd from a stage decked out with slogans such as “For a world without Nazism” and “For our president”. As Putin was finishing his speech, the broadcast was suddenly cut off and state television showed patriotic songs performed earlier in the day by the popular Russian musician Oleg Gazmanov. Soon afterwards, Putin’s speech, which lasted about five minutes, was re-aired from the start, with the Russian leader ending his speech and walking off stage. The Kremlin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov blamed a “technical failure” for the cutoff. One concertgoer told Reuters that Putin left the stage after his speech, with no interruptions having taken place. The event officially marked the eighth anniversary of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, but many of the speeches were aimed at rallying the country behind the current invasion of Ukraine. Moscow police said more than 200,000 people were in and around the Luzhniki Stadium, which in 2018 hosted the men’s football World Cup final. Many were seen waving flags emblazoned with the letter Z, which has gone from a military marking to the main symbol of public support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. During his speech, Putin sought to justify his actions by repeating his unfounded claims that Ukraine was committing genocide in the Donbas region. “This really was genocide. Stopping that was the goal of the special operation,” Putin said, adding – contrary to evidence – that Ukrainian civilians had welcomed Moscow’s invading troops. The Russian leader also hailed the actions of the military fighting in Ukraine by paraphrasing a Bible saying. “There is no greater love than giving up one’s soul for one’s friends,” he said. In the run-up to the rally, Reuters and a number of Russian outlets reported that state employees had been ordered to attend. Russia has a long history of state employees being coerced to attend pro-government rallies.",News/World news,Putin praises Russian ‘unity’ at rally – but state TV broadcast is cut off,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/putin-praises-russian-unity-at-rally-but-state-tv-broadcast-is-cut-off

3/19/2022,"Seth Meyers returned to 2019 on Thursday’s Late Night, as he discredited several Republican attempts to blame Biden for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and for not providing enough aid to the Ukrainian resistance. “I know it’s hard to remember, because Trump melted all of our brains by overloading us with nonstop chaos and insanity,” the host said of the year 2019. “History Channel is going to have to launch its own version of ESPN 2 called History Channel: Stuff That Happened Three Years Ago.” In case you forgot, 2019 is when then-president Trump spoke to Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the phone and threatened to withhold humanitarian aid unless the Ukrainian president provided him a political favor; the call underpinned Trump’s first impeachment trial. Yet in a speech this week, House minority leader Kevin McCarthy blamed Biden for holding up aid to Ukraine. “Are you for real?” Meyers exclaimed. “Does your cable package not have History Channel: Stuff That Happened Three Years Ago? You’re saying Biden is the one who should’ve given Ukraine the aid sooner? The guy you supported tried to extort Ukraine like a mob boss counting singles in the back room of a strip club.” “I think these guys genuinely believe we don’t remember the Trump administration at all,” he continued. “They all want us to think Trump magically would’ve fixed this by being tough on Putin when we all know the opposite was true. “Trump slobbered praise all over Putin every chance he had and was desperate to be Putin’s friend,” he added. “And yet Trump apologists continue to craft this insane mythology where somehow Trump would’ve stopped Putin from invading Ukraine.” “The idea that Donald Trump would’ve been tough on Vladimir Putin is, quite frankly,” to quote Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, “bullcrap.” “While Russia’s military hasn’t had a lot of success recently in terms of capturing Ukrainian territory, that doesn’t mean that the military hasn’t been successful at killing Ukrainian civilians,” said Trevor Noah on the Daily Show. From daily reports of Ukrainian schools, shelters, or hospitals hit by Russian airstrikes, to cities under siege and evacuation channels disrupted, “I honestly don’t know what the point of it all is,” he added. “Like unless Putin’s plan is to win over the Ukrainian people with the world’s largest case of Stockholm syndrome, what is he doing?” “But either way, Ukraine has been saying for weeks that Russia is guilty of war crimes, and now it looks like the president of the United States agrees,” as Joe Biden called Putin a “war criminal” after Zelenskiy’s address to Congress this week. The Kremlin called the remark “absolutely unacceptable and inexcusable,” and pointed to the US bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the second world war. “Ah, seriously Russia, you’re going to bring up something America did in the 40s?” said Noah. “America has committed plenty of war crimes since then, keep up with the times, yo!” “And just because America committed war crimes doesn’t mean you have to as well, Vladimir Putin,” he added. “If all your friends jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too? No, seriously, would you? I’m just brainstorming ways to end this whole thing.” And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel celebrated “St Green’s Vomit Day, also known as St Patrick’s Day, and also known as the day in which the world’s reddest white people wear green.” “I like St Patrick’s Day – it’s an easy holiday,” Kimmel said. “They encourage you to drink, you don’t have to buy gifts. All you really have to do is wear a shirt you wouldn’t ever wear any other day on the rest of the year.” Kimmel also addressed Biden calling Putin a “war criminal” and the Kremlin’s fury at the remark. “So today, Biden called him a murderous dictator and a pure thug,” Kimmel joked. “Tomorrow he’s going to call him a stupidhead and it’s going to get real crazy.” In other Russia news, pharmaceutical companies stopped shipping non-essential drugs to Russia, including Botox, “which is interesting, because Vladimir Putin is widely rumored to use Botox,” Kimmel said. They’re just rumors, but based on one photograph “he absolutely, 100% does,” said Kimmel. “It’s like a real housewife of St Petersburg.” “What a weird time for Russians: their assets are frozen but their foreheads are not,” he quipped.",Arts/Culture,Seth Meyers: ‘Trump slobbered praise all over Putin every chance he had’,https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2022/mar/18/seth-meyers-trump-putin-ukraine
3/19/2022,"Mark Wood will fly home from Barbados to see a specialist in the UK after the elbow injury ended his Caribbean tour and caused his withdrawal from the forthcoming Indian Premier League. The England fast bowler played in last week’s drawn first Test in Antigua but after bowling 17 overs in the first innings reported pain in his right elbow and played no further part in the match. Two sets of scans have determined Wood’s series is over, with England simply calling it a “right elbow injury” and stating he will take “an indefinite break from cricket”. A fuller diagnosis will be determined once the 32-year-old has been assessed by a consultant next week. It is a cruel blow for a bowler who has overcome numerous injuries during his international career and was England’s leading light during an otherwise dismal Ashes series, claiming 17 wickets from the four Tests he played, sustaining remarkable speeds and signing off with match figures of nine for 152 in Hobart. The injury means Wood will no longer join his Indian Premier League franchise, Lucknow Super Giants, after the conclusion of this tour. He had picked up a £735,000 deal in last month’s auction but, like the majority of overseas players, is understood to have his contract covered by insurance. England are yet to decide whether to call for a replacement seamer before next week’s third Test in Grenada. Warwickshire’s Liam Norwell and Sam Cook of Essex are on the standby list but their chances of being added to the squad will hinge on the fitness of Ollie Robinson and Craig Overton, both of whom are sitting out the second Test in Barbados. Robinson was not risked after missing the series opener due to back spasms, while Overton was originally in the XI in Bridgetown only to pull out through exhaustion on the eve of the match and hand Matthew Fisher his Test debut.",Sport/Sport,Mark Wood forced to withdraw from England tour of West Indies and IPL,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/18/mark-wood-forced-to-withdraw-from-england-tour-of-west-indies-and-ipl

3/19/2022,"Guess co-founder Paul Marciano has called claims about his alleged sexual harassment “fabricated”, “false” and an attempt to “extract big money settlements”. Three former models for the fashion brand who alleged they were at the receiving end of sexually inappropriate behaviour from Marciano filed a lawsuit against Guess accusing it of aiding and abetting his alleged harassment. In the lawsuit – which sees the individual board members but not Marciano being sued – two of the alleged victims, Amanda Rodriguez and a woman only known as “Gwen”, claim that despite Guess knowing about 12 allegations of sexual misconduct against Marciano the board of directors voted to keep him on at the company. According to the lawsuit they also decided to give him back his day-to-day role, which included “unfettered access” to female models. Guess is also alleged to have given him a bonus of $3.1m. Marciano currently serves as the chief creative officer at the fashion label. Marciano has repeatedly denied allegations against him, calling these latest accusations, which include groping of the breasts of one of the named models, “false”. Marciano went on to suggest the model’s law firm, The Bloom Firm, headed by Lisa Bloom, had a plan to get him. “I know for a fact that The Bloom Firm has fabricated false claims to alleged rape about me and others to extract big money settlements,” he said in a statement, as reported by Women’s Wear Daily. Marciano called Bloom an “unethical lawyer” who loved “the media attention”. Bloom had previously called Guess “the worst company that I have ever seen”. She added that she didn’t know “of another company that has anywhere near this number of allegations of serious sexual harassment … against a prominent executive” and “yet continues to employ him”. In 2018, model Kate Upton detailed the abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of Marciano to Time magazine, claiming that she was groped and aggressively pursued by him. He later called her claims “preposterous”. After these initial accusations Marciano stepped away from the company and gave up his title of executive chairman. In a statement, the accuser known as Gwen said: “Models deserve to work in a safe environment where they are not subject to unwanted sexual contact. They should be able to speak up when their safety is threatened without having to end their careers with the company.”",Lifestyle/Fashion,Guess co-founder denies sexual harassment claims after models file lawsuit,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/mar/18/guess-paul-marciano-lawsuit-sexual-harassment
3/19/2022,"A widely used kind of recycled plastic bottle passes more potentially harmful chemicals into their contents than newly manufactured bottles, researchers have warned. Researchers from Brunel University London found 150 chemicals that leached into drinks from plastic bottles, with 18 of those chemicals found in levels exceeding regulations. And they found that drinks bottled using recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) can contained higher concentrations of chemicals than those bottled using new PET, which suggests that problems with the recycling process may be causing contamination. They are calling for more careful recycling methods to remove the potentially harmful chemicals. The thermoplastic PET is the third most widely used type of plastic in food packaging, with one of its most popular end uses in single-use drinks bottles. Such bottles are also one of the most commonly found forms of plastic litter, leading to a number of initiatives to increase levels of PET recycling. A recent EU directive called for PET bottles to contain at least 30% recycled content by 2030. But PET is also known for being the source of a number of potential chemical contaminants, including endocrine disruptors such as Bisphenol A, which can cause reproductive disorders, cardiovascular problems and cancer, among other ill effects. The researchers reviewed 91 studies from around the world looking at chemical contamination from plastic bottles. Dr Eleni Iacovidou, a lecturer from Brunel’s centre for pollution research and policy, who led the study, said: “We found these chemicals can come from various sources, such as the catalysts and additives used during production and degradation during PET production, and degradation that can happen across a bottle’s lifecycle.” In recycled PET bottles, many of the contaminants found had arisen as a result of contamination of the feedstock, including labels, according to the paper, published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials. The researchers wrote: “This evidence implies that highly recyclable products, such as PET drink bottles, can be inapt for closed-loop recycling when poorly designed, indicating the need for greater adoption of design-for-recycling principles and improvements at the waste-management infrastructure level.” In particular, to reduce the number of chemicals found in bottled drinks, the study suggests that a technology known as the “super cleaning” process could be used, which uses a three-stage process to clean old plastics before recycling – a high-temperature wash, a gas wash, and a chemical wash. Iacovidou said: “Recycling processes already include the cleaning of the bottles before turning them into secondary raw material for use. By investing in new super-cleaning technologies, we can maximise the likelihood of decontaminating recycled PET to levels similar to virgin PET.” As ever though, the ultimate solution to the problem is for society to begin an end to the use of PET altogether, Iacovidou said. “We all have a responsibility to bear. We need to start thinking about how to prevent the use of PET bottles in our households by investing, for example, in water filters, or large water containers and learning how to dispose of our plastic waste properly,” she said. “If we reduce our consumption of PET then we will drive change further up the system. Less demand equals less production in the first place.”",News/Environment,"Recycled plastic bottles leach more chemicals into drinks, review finds",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/18/recycled-plastic-bottles-leach-more-chemicals-into-drinks-review-finds
3/19/2022,"I’m not entirely clear on what constitutes a fruit fool. In some restaurants, it involves cream, biscuits and fruit; in others, custard, curd and, very rarely, someone will throw in some crushed meringue, so it resembles an Eton mess. Of the versions I’ve made and tried, I love those that put custard to work, because it’s one of my favourite things to eat, as is forced rhubarb, which makes an appearance in so much of what I make at this time of year – jellies, trifles, fools, sorbets, tarts and more.

Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4, then bake the rhubarb mix for 14-18 minutes, until tender but still holding its shape. Remove and leave to cool. In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and 150ml double cream with half each of the sugar and vanilla. In a medium bowl, whisk the egg and egg yolks. In a second bowl, combine the rest of the sugar and cornflour, then whisk this thoroughly into the egg mixture. When the milk is steaming, pour it on to the egg mix, whisking continuously, then pour everything back into the pan and whisk over a medium heat until the custard starts to bubble and thicken. Take off the heat and whisk in the remaining 150ml cream, until smooth. Pour into a heatproof bowl and put a piece of greaseproof paper directly on top of the hot custard to stop a skin forming. Leave to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for four hours (or overnight). To make the biscuits, combine the dry ingredients in a large bowl and stir well. Add the cubed butter and rub in until it’s the consistency of breadcrumbs. Add the golden syrup, knead gently to form a dough, then wrap tightly and rest in the fridge for two hours. Line a baking tray with greaseproof paper. Roll out the biscuit dough to 4mm thick, then, using an 8cm biscuit cutter, cut out 20 rounds and put on the lined tray. Bake in the same 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4 oven for 15-17 minutes, until golden brown, then remove and leave to cool. Gently beat the cold custard in a large bowl and fold in the 300ml whipped double cream. Strain the rhubarb from the light syrup, reserving a few pieces to decorate, and stir through the custard mixture.

I asked Andy Curry, head of investigations at the Information Commissioner’s Office, which enforces good practice in handling personal data such as telephone numbers. I always had a bit of an issue with talking on the phone, because #millennial, but with nuisance calls being so prevalent, I don’t answer at all now. Am I right in thinking the number has shot up?A few years ago they were massively high but during the pandemic they hit the floor. Even the scammers were self-isolating. Now, we’re seeing a return to normality. When does a direct marketing call become a nuisance call?Unlawful marketing calls are nuisance calls. If you get an SMS about an accident and they haven’t asked you for your consent to receive it, that’s unlawful. We can take action on that. If you’re signed up to the Telephone Preference Service, which is the national “do not call” register, we can also take action. I often wonder if I accidentally gave permission, so it’s actually my fault. Although feeling guilty about literally everything is my party trick. What can I say? I grew up with religion.This is part of our advice to people: be careful about who you are handing your telephone number out to. People don’t pay much attention to terms and conditions, which will usually give you some indication. On the other hand, you will get the real rogue operators randomly dialling numbers, or using software to do it. Be careful who you hand your number out to? Oh Andy, where were you when I was dating? Talk me through the process. I’m sitting at home, I get a call, a robot voice tells me I’ve had an accident, when I know the only accident was me answering the phone, I report this to the ICO, then what?We have the power to fine organisations up to £500,000, and we can also issue enforcement notices that compel people to follow the law. So the first thing to do is to tell us about it. If you are on the Telephone Preference Service, we can say: “Coco is registered on TPS, you called her, where’s the permission from Coco to do that?” Why do people do this? Surely there isn’t lots of money to be made this way?The technology to do it is cheap. We actioned a search warrant on a guy we’d located who had been making thousands, if not millions, of calls. We knocked on the door thinking, here we go, and the guy’s basically been sitting there in his underpants with a laptop, eating KFC in a small service office. He was just pumping out this stuff through his laptop. Am I right in thinking that the number of people no longer answering their phones could be a major societal problem? I just imagine GP surgeries never getting their calls answered …You’re spot on.

3/19/2022,"The Conservative chairman has announced Boris Johnson is kicking off a two-year election campaign from this May, in a speech that hit out at “net zero dogma” and sought to pitch Labour as still linked to Jeremy Corbyn. Oliver Dowden, the party co-chair and former culture secretary, gave the speech at the Tory spring conference in Blackpool, as the party attempts to draw a line under the prime minister’s troubles over alleged lockdown-breaking parties. After surviving calls for his resignation from Tory MPs, Johnson appears to be trying to show the party and country that he intends to fight the next election. Dowden announced that the Tories would open the candidate list for the next election and declared: “The challenge starts this May.” He said the election would look a lot more like 2015, when David Cameron fought against Ed Miliband, than 2019, when Johnson took on Corbyn. “We are going to have to fight this one seat by seat, promise delivered by promise delivered, doorstep by doorstep,” he said. “And from May, we will begin our two-year election campaign with the launch of our target seat strategy, building on the experience of the 40:40 campaign in 2015, building capacity, developing profile and framing the choice.” In a sign that the Conservatives are still concerned about the threat of Nigel Farage taking voters on the right, Dowden hit out at “net zero dogma” in comments that will dismay many concerned that the Tories are prepared to water down their commitments to tackling the climate emergency. “I really think the British people want to see a bit of conservative pragmatism, not net zero dogma,” he said. “We are Conservatives. We exist to conserve. We will get to net zero. Of course we will save the planet. We just don’t want Vladimir Putin taking it over while we are doing it.” He also made clear how the Tories are planning to portray Starmer at the next election, as “dull … uninspiring … and bereft of ideas”. Dowden also sought to claim that “the Corbynistas are still there”, reviving the idea of Labour as a danger that was used in the 2019 campaign. “Let’s not be complacent about the threat that Starmer’s party still poses,” he said. “Starmer can’t resist kowtowing to the cancel culture brigade because his base are the cancel culture brigade.” The Conservatives had been widely thought to be planning an election for May 2024 but the imminent repeal of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act means it could more easily be called sooner.",News/Politics,Boris Johnson to launch two-year election campaign in May,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/mar/18/boris-johnson-kicking-off-two-year-election-campaign-in-may
3/19/2022,"Morad Tahbaz, the British-Iranian given a furlough as part of a deal to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Annoosheh Ashoori has been returned to Evin prison in Tehran under armed guard only 48 hours after being released. His family said he was taken from the family home in Tehran in a black car with three armed guards and his wife standing by in tears. A distressed member of the Tahbaz family said “the furlough negotiated by the UK government with the Iranians was just a cover so the UK could free the other two British-Iranians, and then enjoy a victory lap”. They insisted that Tahbaz, a conservationist sentenced to 10 years in jail in November 2019 for being in contact with the US, was the only British-born member of the group of three whose release was being negotiated. The family member said “an armed guard was present in the family home, and the visit was first for 10 hours and then extended to 24 hours and finally to 48 hours. It was never a proper furlough, but a short family visit.” Efforts by the British ambassador to Tehran to visit Tahbaz failed. The exact understanding between the British Foreign Office and the Iranian government over the extent of his furlough was never revealed. The Foreign Office may feel it has been misled, or alternatively knew it had little chance to protect him once the UK had paid the £400m debt to Iran. Liz Truss, the UK foreign secretary, made it clear in interviews that although she was seeking Tahbaz’s release along with the others, she was not prepared to make it a condition of the payment that all three were released. An earlier negotiation between the Iranians and the Foreign Office then led by the then foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, broke down in January 2021 when Tahbaz insisted his release should be part of the deal. The Iranian government regards Tahbaz as an American – he has American, British and Iranian citizenship – so were resistant to him being part of any deal.

3/19/2022,"After 11 years of war, the destruction of towns, cities and much of the Syrian military, Bashar al-Assad’s army has launched a recruitment drive. But the recruits are not fresh from bootcamps and will not fight on the home front. They are the vanguard of what could be the biggest state-backed mercenary force in the world. Within days, Syrian troops could be deployed to reinforce the stalled Russian frontlines in Ukraine, where Vladimir Putin is about to extract a lethal price for Moscow’s rescue of the Syrian leader. The first Syrian troops to join Putin’s ranks – an advance force of 150 – arrived in Russia on Thursday, European intelligence officials claim. Ukrainian military intelligence, echoing a claim by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, believes 40,000 Syrians have signed up to fight – a figure that would represent a sizeable chunk of the battle-ready capacity of the country’s entire military. In the economic wasteland of post-war Syria, the best – and maybe only – state-backed job on offer is one that those who sign on for might not come home from. The vast majority of newly enlisted Syrian mercenaries are trading in salaries of $15 a month for monthly deals worth between $600 and $3,000. Rank and experience in the gruelling decade of insurrection attracts the higher dollars, but even the basic salary is luring recruits who have few ways out of overwhelming poverty. Syrians have shown a readiness to sign up at least 14 recruitment centres across the country, in Aleppo, Damascus, Deir Azzour, Homs and Hama, as well as Raqqa, which less than five years ago was at the centre of the war against Islamic State. “They have been arriving in the dozens to the regime base in Raqqa,” said a Kurdish fighter with the Syrian Democratic Forces in north-east Syria. “We can see them turn up. The Russians have also asked [Kurdish groups] to join them, but I don’t know of anyone who has done so yet.” In western Syria, some of the regime’s most prestigious units claim to have signed up thousands from their ranks. The Fifth Division, which was trained by Moscow, the 4th Division, which is loyal to Assad’s brother, Maher, and the Tiger Forces, which played prominent roles in the war, are all central to the recruitment push, which will seriously stretch their already depleted ranks and potentially turn Assad’s ragtag army into the largest mercenary force in Ukraine. Comparatively safe in his palace thanks to Russian backing, and in the debt of Putin if he wants to remain there, Assad appears to have given Moscow carte blanche to airlift his army, and his commanders free rein to enlist them. The vulnerable state that leaves his forces at home seems secondary to returning a favour that the Syrian leader has no other way to honour. Ukrainian officials say the mercenary force will fly from the Khmeimim base on daily military transport flights. Militia groups that had fought alongside them are also joining the recruitment drive, with Palestinians, National Defence Front troops, the Ba’ath party and even some members of Shia militia groups that fought in Syria under Iran’s auspices joining in. Pro-regime militia groups have been trained and backed by Russian units since late 2015, when Putin formally intervened to save Assad. At that point, the Iranian general Qassem Suleimani had convinced Putin that Assad was only weeks away from losing the Alawite heartland of western Syria to opposition groups who had decimated his armoured units with precision-guided missiles smuggled across the Turkish border by the CIA. Ever since, Putin has established a tutelage over Assad and, during visits to Syria, has rarely wasted an opportunity to assert his dominance. During inspections of Russian troops at Kheimemin, Putin led entourages, forcing Assad to trail behind him. He has insisted on meetings in Russian bases instead of the presidential palace – a clear slight to a leader who he regularly complained was yet to return Russia’s investment in blood and treasure. In the city of Homs, business is reportedly brisk at a regime recruitment post. “I had to wait for three hours,” said one soldier, a sergeant, who said he had few qualms about travelling to Ukraine. “The Russians helped us a lot and now we will help them,” he said. Asked what he would be paid, he responded: “Twenty-five times what I’m earning now. You don’t think the terrorists from Idlib won’t go to join the Ukrainians? Of course they will. We will be fighting each other again, but this time in the snow.” A second pro-regime fighter, who fought for four months in a militia in southern Syria last year, said he had been offered $600 plus death benefits to travel to Ukraine. “That is more than I could ever earn in Syria,” he said. “That is putting a value on my life, I know, but that’s what life is worth these days. If I die there, at least my family can live.”",News/World news,Syrians join Russian ranks in Ukraine as Putin calls in Assad’s debt,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/18/syrians-join-russian-ranks-in-ukraine-as-putin-calls-in-assads-debt
