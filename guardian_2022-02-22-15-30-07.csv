2/22/2022,"GPs and women are still ignoring key symptoms of ovarian cancer despite better awareness of the disease, a charity has warned, prompting fears that yet more patients will be diagnosed late and “die needlessly”. Symptoms include frequently having a swollen tummy or feeling bloated; pain or tenderness in the tummy or the pelvis; having no appetite or feeling full quickly after eating, and an urgent need to pee or needing to pee more often, according to the NHS.  However, Target Ovarian Cancer is concerned that despite successful campaigns to boost awareness of the disease, many are still failing to act on the vital signs. “Key symptoms are being ignored – both by those experiencing them and their GPs,” a spokesperson said. A poll of 1,000 women for the charity found 79% did not know that bloating was a symptom, while 68% were unaware abdominal pain was a sign, and 97% did not know feeling full was another. Most women (99%) did not know that needing to pee more urgently was also a sign, while evidence suggests women can often be told by their GP that their symptoms are more a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Target Ovarian Cancer said. The survey also found 40% of women also incorrectly believed ovarian cancer could be picked up by screening for cervical cancer. Ovarian cancer kills about a third of women with the disease in the first year after diagnosis, and is often diagnosed in the late stages. There are about 7,500 new ovarian cancer cases in the UK every year. “These figures are incredibly disappointing,” said Annwen Jones, the chief executive of Target Ovarian Cancer. “We know we’ve shifted the dial in the past 10 years through the dedication of thousands of Target Ovarian Cancer’s campaigners, but it is not enough. Knowing the symptoms is crucial for everyone. “We need to make sustained and large-scale government-backed symptoms campaigns a reality. Progress is possible. If we do this, fewer people will be diagnosed late, fewer will need invasive treatment, and, ultimately, fewer will die needlessly from ovarian cancer.” Katy Stephenson, 47, from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, was diagnosed with early-stage ovarian cancer last year. “I had been experiencing symptoms like bloating and needing to wee more urgently for a few months, but I’d put it down to being peri-menopausal,” she said. “I had a fluke diagnosis when I was admitted to hospital with appendicitis. If that hadn’t happened, the cancer probably would have spread, and I hate to think about what would have happened.” Dr Victoria Barber, a GP in Northamptonshire and advocate for early diagnosis of ovarian cancer, said: “Symptoms do appear early on in ovarian cancer, and your GP wants to hear from you if you’re experiencing any of them, if they are new for you and if they do not go away. Similarly, it’s vital that GPs are knowledgable on ovarian cancer and know how to advise patients who have concerns.”",News/Society,"Ovarian cancer symptoms are being ignored, UK charity warns",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/ovarian-cancer-symptoms-ignored-uk-charity-warns
2/22/2022,"The government has shown a “total lack of understanding of how food production works”, introduced “completely contradictory policies” on farming, and risks “repeatedly running into crises” through the lack of a post-Brexit plan for UK farming, the leading representative of British farmers will say today. Minette Batters, president of the National Farmers’ Union, will make a scathing attack on ministers’ failures, unprecedented in recent memory in its ferocity from a farming leader.  Her withering assessment of the government’s actions reflects widespread anger and alarm among many sections of the UK’s farming and food production industries, one of the country’s biggest manufacturing industries and employers. Farmers have suffered from plunging exports and reams of new red tape owing to Brexit, staff shortages as EU seasonal workers have left, and the prospect of floods of cheap low-quality imports after post-Brexit trade deals. Batters will highlight the fate of the pig industry – which is facing near-collapse under rising costs and staffing shortages – and warn that similar disasters will hit other branches of farming unless the government acts. She will tell the NFU conference in Birmingham: “We need a plan that pre-empts crises, rather than repeatedly runs into them … this country needs a strategy and a clear vision for what we expect from British farming. We have completely contradictory government policies. It is raising the bar for environmental standards at home but pursuing trade deals which support lower standards overseas. It is claiming to value domestic food production but making it difficult to find workers to harvest or process it. It is stating there are many export opportunities for British food but failing to prioritise the resources to open up those new markets.” She will call for “certainty, commitment and consistency” in government policy, and point to the successes of British farmers in raising animal welfare and food production standards, improving the environment and pushing to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions. But, in excerpts from her speech distributed on Monday night, she pulled few punches in criticising ministers for their lack of planning, and failure to respond to recent problems in farming. Pig producers are looking after 200,000 pigs that should have been sent to slaughter, but cannot be because of a lack of staff in abattoirs. Keeping the pigs on their farms costs farmers dearly, wiping out their potential profits. About 40,000 pigs have had to be culled, which creates a further cost to farmers, as well as being a waste of resources. This “disaster” in the pig industry “should have and could have been avoided”, according to Batters. The situation for pig farmers “truly is an utter disgrace”, she will say. “This is down to the government’s poorly designed change to immigration policy and what I can only say appears to be its total lack of understanding of how food production works and what it needs.” The prime minister, Boris Johnson, angered many farmers last year when he appeared to make a joke of the crisis in pig production, telling the BBC that pigs raised for food were destined to die anyway. This appeared to ignore the costs to farmers, and their distress at having to put down healthy animals for no purpose. George Dunn, chief executive of the Tenant Farmers Association, also called for more focus from ministers, particularly in relation to the reforms to post-Brexit subsidies, which will see farmers paid “public money for public goods” through the replacement of EU subsidies with environmental land management contracts (ELMs), whereby farmers are paid for reaching certain environmental improvement goals. Dunn said: “We need to see a bit more strategy from the government as to how its various policy strands fit together into a consistent whole. ELMs is only one part of a panoply of initiatives including support for new entrants, farming resilience, food policy, standards in trade, regulation and enforcement and supply chain measures which at best continue to be developed in silos. Currently, it feels like there are few threads bringing the patchwork quilt of initiatives together. Farmers need to plan for the long term and want to be in line with wider public policy – however, until that becomes clearer we run the risk of a lack of alignment.” The NFU wants the government to invest in British farming to sell more homegrown food within the UK, and help farmers to export it; to ensure farmers can get a fair deal with supermarkets, which currently often use their market dominance to squeeze farmers’ profit margins; to reform immigration policy to allow more seasonal farm workers; and to reform farm subsidies in a way that encourages food production as well as meeting environmental objectives. Batters will say: “Above and beyond everything, we need to all be working to the same objectives and aiming for the same outcome. There needs to be a plan. A plan which enables Britain to keep on farming and to continue to be world leaders in high quality, safe and sustainable food.”",News/Environment,‘Completely contradictory’: NFU leader attacks UK farming policy,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/22/completely-contradictory-nfu-leader-attacks-uks-farming-policy
2/22/2022,"Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance metals empire has launched an action in London’s high court in a last-ditch attempt to reclaim a prized aluminium smelter in northern France from a US private equity fund. Two GFG Alliance companies have filed a legal claim against a fund controlled by American Industrial Partners (AIP), which has run the smelter in Dunkerque since October after gaining approval from the French government.  The claim is centred on a complex series of loan agreements, but GFG’s court filings suggest the case may prompt further scrutiny on operations controlled by Gupta. AIP alleged in September that it was unable to accept payments from GFG related to the loans because of an allegation that GFG companies may have broken Romanian law, the court filings suggest. The complex battle over ownership of the smelter has added to the pressure on Gupta amid protracted financial problems that were triggered by the collapse of its main lender, Greensill Capital, in March last year. Before its collapse, Greensill had employed former prime minister David Cameron, who repeatedly lobbied government ministers on its behalf. Gupta’s companies are also facing criminal investigations in several countries. The UK’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is investigating “suspected fraud, fraudulent trading and money laundering” in relation to GFG and Greensill, while Paris prosecutors have said they are looking into several allegations of misuse of corporate assets and money laundering. German authorities are also investigating. The Dunkerque smelter, thought to be the largest in Europe, was an important asset for Gupta because it was still profitable, and high aluminium prices in recent months have made it even more attractive. However, days after announcing that they had taken control in October, AIP executives arrived at the site and informed surprised managers that they were the new owners. They have been running the site ever since. In the particulars of a claim signed by Gupta, the GFG companies argued that AIP was acting “in bad faith, oppressively and/or otherwise unconscionably” in order to “appropriate” the smelter. AIP has not yet filed its response to GFG’s claims. However, GFG’s filing said that AIP claimed it was unable to accept a loan repayment because of “an unparticularised allegation that Romanian law had been contravened”. The filing also described four separate requests for “KYC” (know-your-customer) information from GFG by AIP between July and September. KYC checks are required by companies under anti-money-laundering (AML) laws. The court case comes amid scrutiny of GFG’s operations in Romania, where it runs a large steelworks in Galati, a port city on the river Danube. A Czech government minister last year called for an investigation into the sale of carbon credits worth £40m from a Czech steelworks to GFG’s company, Liberty Galati. The Financial Times on Thursday reported that GFG companies had routed transactions through a Romanian bank owned by Gupta, the Bucharest-based Banca Romana de Credite si Investitii (BRCI). A GFG Alliance spokesperson said: “None of the funds tendered to repay the [loan] facility with AIP had any connection with BRCI.” The spokesperson said it was GFG’s opinion that AIP had “unlawfully expropriated the valuable aluminium smelter”, and said GFG had been able to “pay all liabilities owed to AIP under a financing agreement”. In a statement, BRCI said it was a “completely independent banking institution with a fully independent board of directors”. It also said it has “a strong AML and compliance function that has served it well over many years”. GFG says it employs as many as 35,000 people across the world in steel, aluminium and energy, with 5,000 people in the UK. However, several key assets are under threat, on top of the criminal investigations. HM Revenue and Customs this month filed in the courts to shut down four Liberty Steel companies in the UK over unpaid tax. A spokesman for AIP declined to comment.",News/Business,GFG Alliance launches high court action to reclaim aluminium smelter,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/gfg-alliance-launches-high-court-action-to-reclaim-aluminium-smelter
2/22/2022,"Flooding, power cuts and destruction to homes continue to impact people in parts of the country after three named storms struck the UK in a week. In Ashford in the Water, Derbyshire, cars remain stuck in a flooded road after Storm Franklin hit on Sunday. Martin Crapper, 62, said people in “countless cars” were trapped “in the freezing cold flood water in the dark” on the main road from Matlock to Buxton.  The health and safety manager said that mountain rescue had to help an elderly man on Sunday evening. “Then there were other people who got stuck, and they didn’t venture out [of their cars] – they waited for four or five hours for rescue to come and drag them [the vehicles] out.” He added that local people “tried to help as best as possible with cups of tea and opening [their] homes for warmth and shelter”. The council closed the road on Sunday evening, but some drivers have ignored the signs and continued driving through the area, Crapper said, creating “huge tidal waves causing more risk to trapped cars”. “The trouble is, it’s on a blind bend, so with the dark, you come round the corner and you’re in it before you know it.” Crapper explained that though the area is aptly named and tends to flood, it’s the worst flooding he has witnessed in the five years he’s lived there. “Last January was bad, but this is even worse. My neighbour next door but one, he’s lived here for over 10 years – he’s never seen anything like this,” Crapper said. Pippa Palmer, 59, was at home sheltering from Storm Eunice in London on Friday when she heard a “deafening” cracking noise. “I was sitting there trying to reassure my dog that nothing was wrong. He’ll never believe another word,” Palmer said. In the garden four doors down from Palmer, a research strategist, is a giant mimosa tree: “It is 25 ft, 7.6 metres. It’s bloody huge,” she said. After hearing the crash, Palmer said she went into the garden and just saw a branch down. “I thought, that made a loud noise. Then I turned around and was like, oh my Christ there’s a tree on my house.” The 25-ft tree is now horizontal, having crashed through three fences in neighbours gardens. “The top boughs hit my house with almighty force,” Palmer said, adding that she has filed an insurance claim and that people are coming tomorrow to start “carving” the tree up. “It has crashed through my bathroom roof and crushed my artist’s studio in the garden. The tree’s holding the roof on to the studio. We’re worried about what’s gonna happen when the tree is taken off.” When the power went off in Yvonne Turner’s home in Aberdeenshire on Monday morning, it was the third time in as many months. Fortunately, it was just for a few hours this time, but recent storms Arwen, Corrie and Malik have seen their area cut off for days on end. “We are feeling quite fed up,” Turner, 58, said, explaining that outages keep occurring because trees are knocked over on to power lines. For Turner, losing power is “doubly a pain” as it also means having their water supply cut off, as the domestic supply is pumped from a borehole. Finding drinking water during Storm Arwen proved difficult: all the supermarkets had “completely sold out”. “We had a bit of a struggle, but eventually found a welfare van in town, and we were able to get some water on the second day. When you have no electricity and no water, and it’s wintertime, it’s quite tough.” As Turner grows her own produce and keeps livestock, the frequent power cuts are particularly stressful. “We fill our freezer with produce at the end of the season and it lasts for the rest of the year. So when the power goes down for several days, it’s really quite a problem – we’re faced with losing all of our year’s work.” In Gloucestershire, Douglas Campbell, 63, has been without power for more than 72 hours after Storm Eunice hit on Friday. Campbell, a 63-year-old company director, and his family of four moved to a nearby hotel on Sunday, as the property was “uninhabitable”. “Everything is fired by electricity, so no hot water, no light, no heat, no nothing. It’s been a terrible time,” he said, adding that he’s been “reliably informed” by his provider, Scottish Power, that electricity will be back by 11pm on Monday. “We had no choice but to move out.” “We waited because we hoped and hoped that it would get better but by the time Sunday morning came, there was no way to boil water or have a wash,” Campbell said, adding that they were doing everything with “candles, like the dark ages”. “It was hopeless so we had to move on.” The 63-year-old said the storm has not damaged their home, but two trees in the garden have been uprooted. “It’s the worst storm in recent memory,” Campbell, who has lived in the area for 30 years, said. “[The power] is due to be restored at 11pm on Monday, but it’s taken them a very, very long time,” Campbell said. “If it doesn’t come back on today, we’ll have to try and ring the bell a bit harder. But at the end of the day, I suppose thousands of people are in the same boat.”",News/Environment,‘We’re quite fed up’: Britons on weathering the aftermath of three storms,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/22/were-quite-fed-up-britons-on-weathering-the-aftermath-of-three-storms

2/22/2022,"The number of people homeless in England is predicted to jump by a third by 2024 as councils warn of a “tidal wave” of need caused by benefits freezes, soaring food and energy bills and the end of Covid eviction bans. More than 66,000 more people will be homeless by 2024, with the bulk of the increase being among people forced to “sofa surf”, according to annual forecasts by the housing charity Crisis and Heriot-Watt University. There will be 8,000 more people rough sleeping and 9,000 people forced into unsuitable temporary accommodation.  The chief executive of Crisis, Matt Downie, described the findings as “a huge cause for concern”, as a survey of 155 English councils also found that nine out of 10 town halls expect to see an increase in evictions from private rented homes over the next year. Eight out of 10 fear increases in homeless children. “We are expecting a tidal wave, to put it mildly,” an official at one council in southern England told the researchers. “It is going to be a very, very busy couple of years.” Councils in London, where living costs are highest, are predicting the biggest surge. The bleak projections come as government measures to prevent homelessness during the pandemic unwind. Core homelessness in England – a concept which captures the most acute forms of homelessness – is estimated to have totalled 203,400 in 2020, down 5% on 2019 levels. This was primarily due to the widely praised “Everyone In” initiative during the pandemic which saw rough sleepers housed in hotels. But this measure is now predicted to rise to 270,000 by 2024 and reach close to 300,000 by 2036, unless further countermeasures are taken. Evictions slumped during the pandemic, as ministers paused court proceedings, but are now increasing again. There were more than 14,000 possession claims between October and December last year, a 42% rise on the previous quarter. Energy price rises this spring forecast at over 40% will hit single-adult households on low incomes hardest. They could be forced to spend 54% of their income on bills compared with 6% for a middle-income family, according to estimates by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. “It doesn’t have to be like this,” said Downie. “The protections put in place during the pandemic helped thousands of people off the streets and prevented many more from facing homelessness. It would be shameful for this progress to unravel before us, at a huge human cost and a financial one for the local councils left to foot the bill.” In December, the government announced a £316m homelessness prevention fund for councils for the next financial year that it said would protect tens of thousands of people from homelessness. It was welcomed by Crisis and the founder of the Big Issue, John Bird. But Crisis is calling on the government to further increase the Local Housing Allowance – the amount the state will pay to cover rent for people on benefits – so it truly covers the cost of rent across the country. The allowance was rebased at 30% of market rents in spring 2020 but was frozen from April 2021. It also repeated its call for more social housing to be built. Only 5,955 new homes for the cheapest social rents were provided in England 2020/21, down from nearly 40,000 a year a decade ago. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “Government interventions have prevented almost 450,000 households from becoming homeless since 2017. “This year, councils have been given an extra £65 million to support low income households with rent arrears. “We’re also banning no-fault evictions, and a £316 million homelessness prevention grant will help people who are homeless or at risk of losing their home to find a new one, get help with evictions or move into temporary accommodation.”",News/Society,Homelessness set to soar in England amid cost of living crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/homelessness-set-to-soar-in-england-amid-cost-of-living-crisis
2/22/2022,"If 1960s housing was known for concrete panels, the 1980s for cartoonish pediments, and the 2000s for tacky (sometimes fatal) clip-on cladding, the current epoch will be remembered for bricks. But not just any old brick. It is a yellowish, biscuity brick, whose particular patina falls somewhere between a digestive and a Hobnob. It is a brick that summons strains of the traditional London stock and Cambridge gault, suggesting a crunchy, crumbly, wholesome goodness, no matter what actually lies behind the facade. It is the comforting Hovis ad of cladding choices, a no-nonsense cooked clod of clay, which comes with an unlikely name: Mystique. The irrepressible rise of the Mystique brick can be traced back to its use on one particular housing project in Cambridge, which won the Stirling prize in 2008. With its combination of terraced streets, mews houses and courtyards, the Accordia development was a refreshing bolt of common-sense design that would influence the next decade and more of British housing. In an age when new blocks of flats looked increasingly cheap, the low-rise buttery brickwork suggested a new era of weight, depth and permanence, a return to front doors on the street, housing as it used to be.  Almost 15 years later, two of the architects of Accordia – Alison Brooks and Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios (FCBS) – have been working together again, joined by a younger firm, Gort Scott, in an altogether tougher context. They have swapped leafy Cambridge for the gritty South Kilburn estate in Brent, the poorest borough in west London, and exchanged an enclave of million-pound homes for the 235 council flats of Unity Place. But the Mystique is back, in bigger quantities than ever.Alison Brooks, who lives nearby and has worked on the estate for 12 years, building two other projects (also in Mystique), says the first task was to restore the street network. She describes the previous 1960s blocks as “moated”, set back on a podium of car parking that effectively blocked access between the streets. A new pedestrian route now runs through the site, where avenues of cherry trees frame a playground, forming a picturesque vista that terminates in the gothic revival facade of St Augustine’s church – affectionately known as the “cathedral of north London”. The bulk of the scheme follows the new London vernacular, a kind of politely proportioned, stripped-back Georgian architecture, synonymous with recent housing in the capital. Citing a popular precedent, the architects took inspiration from the desirable mansion blocks of nearby Maida Vale, replacing the 18-storey slab and four-storey walk-ups with a higher-density arrangement of six to eight storeys that frame private courtyard gardens. Brooks’s trio of buildings depart from the norm: they are kinked and chamfered, with oversized mansard roofs clad with champagne-coloured terracotta tiles, and screened balconies that dance across the facades. Across the street stand the two more sober L-shaped blocks by FCBS and Gort Scott. The former reflects Brooks’s slanted geometries at its upper storeys, while the latter enjoys inset balconies and is crowned with a sharp white concrete colonnade around its top two levels, echoing the tracery of the church.The aim, says George Wilson of FCBS, was “similar themes done slightly differently”, with a consistent material palette – the acres of Mystique brick, offset with metallic beige metalwork – livened up by tweaks to the massing. The location of a mains water pipe beneath Brooks’s site, for example, led to one block being cut into a quirky triangular flatiron shape, adorned with balconies on its prow and topped with a cornice. Another of her blocks features green-glazed bricks and long, broad balconies overlooking the courtyard, breaking up the oatmeal mass of the rest of the scheme. While attention has been paid to creating a good streetscape, the design of the flats themselves seems like a bit of an afterthought. The majority are dual aspect, but there are some floors of some single-aspect flats reached from gloomy double-loaded corridors (ie with doors to apartments on both sides), with uninspiring layouts. The result can feel as if the homes have been squeezed inside a predetermined envelope, rather than the blocks designed around the best possible internal configuration. The architects weren’t retained in the design-and-build process, so there is some of the usual bodging, like doors to balconies in common areas that have been replaced with unopenable fire vents, making them impossible to access. The inclusion of a district heating system in the basement also now seems questionable – in vogue at the time of design, the general consensus has since moved on from them being as beneficial as once thought, as they sometimes lock residents into costly contracts. The project is the latest phase in the regeneration of the South Kilburn estate, which has had as chequered history as any such schemes. Once home to Victorian terraces, the 48-hectare site was mostly cleared in the postwar years, an action justified by bomb damage and overcrowding, and replaced with modernist slabs, some built with the “Bison block” system of prefab concrete panels craned into place. In the right light they have a charm that, to a degree, recalls the Hungarian modernist Marcel Breuer, but they were built without the correct rubber seals, leading to years of cold, damp, draughty misery for residents. “You could spill a bucket of water on the 10th floor,” says Leslie Barson, who has worked on the estate for 29 years, running a home education centre and community kitchen, “and someone on the fourth floor would get a damp patch.” Successive attempts to fix the estate brought their own problems. The Blairite New Deal for Communities in the 2000s was an unmitigated disaster, with more than £50m spent on the estate, and hardly anything to show for it. A probe into misconduct resulted in the resignation of the programme’s chief executive, and the sacking of his deputy, in 2006.Several blocks built since then have been plagued by construction flaws. Granville New Homes, built by contractor Higgins in 2009 and bought by Brent’s housing company for £17.1m, has suffered from leaks and cladding issues, leaving an estimated repair cost of £18.5m. Ironically, Higgins has since been chosen to repair defects to another block, Merle Court, built just around the corner in 2012. Last year, a window crashed to the pavement from a fifth-floor flat at Bourne Place, built by Denne for L&Q in 2013. It was described as “another day of stress and terror” by residents, who had long complained of loose-fitting balcony doors falling from their hinges. The list goes on: a catalogue of calamities that regularly makes the pages of the Kilburn Times, featuring tenants who feel “trapped” in what they say are “defective and neglected” housing association homes. “There are seven housing associations on the estate and they don’t talk to each other,” says Barson. “When rats run from one block’s bins to another, they won’t do anything because it’s someone else’s problem.” Barson and her colleagues at the Granville community centre have been battling for a decade to get the residents’ voices heard in the process of regeneration, with some success. The Victorian building where they have run a community kitchen since 2014 will now be saved, although it will be swamped by further flats, and she is critical of the lack of proper community space in the new developments. “Kids from different blocks could play together before,” she says, “but now all the gardens are gated. There is a new ‘hub’ for council services, but nowhere you can have a birthday party or a coffee morning.”Pablo Sendra, a housing activist and academic at UCL, has been working with residents to develop an alternative community-led plan for part of the estate that has yet to face the wrecking ball (PDF). Working with architects, social scientists and a quantity surveyor, they have shown how two of the 1960s blocks that didn’t use the concrete panel system (William Dunbar and William Saville houses) could be eminently retrofitted and, along with some infill development, provide a higher proportion of social-rented homes than the council’s demolish-and-rebuild strategy, with a fraction of the embodied carbon cost. But the council refuses to reconsider. “The older buildings just don’t work,” says councillor Shama Tatler, lead member for regeneration. “No matter how much money we put into refurbishing, it’s impossible.” She cites the 2019 estate-wide ballot, in which 84% of residents voted to press ahead with regeneration, although critics point out the survey didn’t differentiate by block, and the question posed a blunt “yes or no” to improvements. To Brent’s credit, it is doing better than many London boroughs. There is a commitment to rehouse everyone on the estate, and there will be a net increase in social-rented units, from 1,568 to 1,626, along with 155 shared ownership homes – cross-subsidised by 1,356 flats for market sale. Unity Place is the best of the bunch so far, and it is something of an anomaly in being 100% social rented, after Brent secured £111m from the mayor of London’s pot for “genuinely affordable” homes, £30m of which funded this. It sounds like a big win, until you realise that the council bought the development from Telford Homes and Notting Hill Genesis for £92m in 2019 – having sold them the site for just £3m a few years earlier. It is an indictment of the lack of central government funding for so long that local authorities have been left having to buy back market homes with mayoral handouts, while housebuilders continue to laugh their way to the bank, often leaving leaky, dangerous, shoddily built blocks in their wake.",Arts/Art and design,Mellow yellow – how a feelgood buttery brick revived a decaying 1960s estate,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/feb/22/mellow-yellow-south-kilburn-feelgood-buttery-brick-revived-1960s-estate
2/22/2022,"The stereotype is that farmers are up with the crowing cockerel, but that’s only really dairy farmers. Most days it is not until 7.45am that you’ll find Rachel Hallos swinging open the door of Beeston Hall Farm in Ripponden, Yorkshire. Beeston Hall is a hill farm overlooking Baitings reservoir, which lies in the valley of the River Ryburn. The 800-hectare (2,000-acre) farm consists of steep fields demarcated by dry stone walls that crumble in a squall. The hill is crested by heather-covered moorland that turns purple in summer and copper in autumn. Hallos lives in a traditional Pennines farmhouse made out of handsome slabs of grey Yorkshire gritstone. A Brontë house, for Brontë country. Inside, wan light streams through single-pane windows on to a well-trodden oak staircase that creaks. Hallos steps outside, dressed in a padded waterproof coat and wellies. She is met by a cacophony of noise. Her terrier Jack yaps with shrill urgency. Jim, a border collie, barks incessantly. Hallos feeds the dogs and then the two scrawny black-and-white cats, which sleep in the outbuildings and yowl for treats at the kitchen window. She fills a sack with hay that is sweet-smelling and almost yeasty, from the fermentation process that takes place when it is stored in plastic for the winter months. She hoists the sack on to her shoulder like Father Christmas and takes it to feed Aiden and Danny, her dun geldings.  It is late October 2021. Autumn is Hallos’s favourite season. The trees around the reservoir are gold-flecked, ochre and vermilion. Her herd of 200 cows and calves and flock of 400 sheep are out in the fields. The cows will return when the frost sets in; the sheep stay out all winter. Hallos usually feels a sense of quiet satisfaction this time of year. The autumn calves are grazing beside their mothers in the fields. The sheds have been power-hosed and disinfected, ready for winter. There’s a bit of breathing room, after the rigours of summer: the never-ending hay baling and attending to the newborn calves and lambs. In autumn, Hallos can start to plan for the spring calves and lambs. Which tup will go with which sheep, and which bull with which cow? The farm overlooks West Yorkshire moorland. But this autumn feels different. Hallos just bought in a load of straw, for the herd’s winter beds, and beef nut to supplement their diet in winter, when the grass stops growing and the last of the summer hay has been eaten. Feed has gone up by £90 a tonne. Diesel for the tractors has increased by 20p a litre. When she last ordered the diesel, Hallos asked for a quote, but the supplier told her they couldn’t give her one, because the prices change every day. “The costs are getting a bit scary,” she says. Because they are tenant farmers, they can’t rely on land rents to subsidise their farming operations. Because they are primary producers, they can’t pass on their costs to anyone below them in the supply chain. Their calves and lambs are taken twice a year to Skipton auction market, and the price they get is the price they get. Already Hallos, who is 51, and her husband, Steve, 60, live a frugal life. They pay themselves just £250 a month each out of the business as a stipend, to cover their household expenses. Hallos’s one frivolity is a fortnightly manicure, so you can’t see the muck under her fingernails, and also because it makes her feel good. Their two grownup children, Anna, 22, and Sam, 25, work on the farm, and receive the minimum wage. Hallos is worried about how she will heat the farmhouse this winter. In September, energy prices increased by 12%. In April, they will increase by 54%, an average of £693 a year a household. “It’s a beautiful house, but cold and draughty,” she says. In addition to these increased costs, Beeston Hall Farm will lose its EU-funded basic payment scheme grant of £60,000 a year in 2027, as part of the UK’s post-Brexit transition. But Hallos is always ebullient, no matter what she faces. She does this job not for the money, but for the love of it. “How lucky we are,” she says, in a broad Yorkshire accent. “It’s hard work. But we can walk outside and take pride in what we do. We keep a nice tidy farm with healthy animals. A lot of people just jump in their car and go to work. It’s a sense of belonging.” They bring in the first lot of cattle in the first week of November. Sixty spring-calving cows and calves amble down from the top of the hill into the sheds, which have been prepared with fresh straw that is replaced daily. The rest of the herd will return over the coming weeks. Many herds stay out all winter, but in this part of the world, and this landscape, the grazing season is short. The pedigree salers and charolais cattle feeding in the sheds where they are housed over winter. Ripponden is windy and wet. When it rains, water streams off the hills. The soil here is clay and peat bog, which turns to mulch in winter. If left out in winter, the cattle’s manure could leach into the water supply. And besides, there’s nothing for the herd to eat: when the temperature drops beneath 6C, grass stops growing. Hallos is considering replacing the grass in the lower fields, which is Yorkshire fog, with a genetically modified variant that is hardier and sweeter, but she’s not sure. “We’re a traditional farm,” she says. “It’s old-fashioned grass.” Theirs is a pedigree herd of salers and charolais. Salers have curly red-brown coats, calve easily and produce high-quality, lean meat, although not as much as the golden-coloured charolais, which grow quicker and produce a high number of saleable cuts. Sam drives a tractor down the cattle shed, blasting fresh hay over the tops of the cows and calves. Sometimes, the calves dance in the spray. Later, they will eat the straw, which scratches the rumen, their largest stomach compartment, and aids digestion. Hallos surveys the herd carefully, watching for any signs of sickness or stress. This is called stockmanship. “A lot of a farmer’s time,” Hallos says, “is just looking. Is there one cow in the corner, facing the other way? You can tell from their eyes and ears that they’re sad. If that happens for a few consecutive days, you think: something’s not right.” Stockmanship is knowing when a cow is being bullied by the rest of the herd, or when she is lame, or in pain. Cows can be bullies. One might block another from eating; the victim will grow thinner and weaker. When that happens, Hallos pulls the cow out of the herd and places her with the younger calves, so she can eat and build her strength back. Short-faced heifers are playful. They like to tug at Hallos’s sleeve. Even Oakley the bull is gentle enough, if you treat him right. More than anything, he loves to have his coarse hide scratched, especially on his back. Sometimes, he will drool with pleasure. Farmers can’t afford to be sentimental, but they all have their favourites. Steve’s was Octavia. “She was a leader,” Hallos says. “You could get the rest of the herd to follow her, if you’d give her bits of corn.” Narissa was hers. “I just loved her. She was a queen. She would stand in the field with so much presence.” They used to do the show circuit together. Hallos trained her to stand square and straight for the display, to walk around the pen when called upon, to be calm and content in the trailer home. She grew lame as she got older. It’s a stiff climb to the higher grazing land, up on the moor, and Narissa would strain herself to get up there. It wasn’t fair on her. Hallos couldn’t bear to take her to market and see a stranger lead her away. “Not like that,” she says. “She produced a calf for us every year. She did her bit. More than her bit.” On their last day together, Hallos had a few quiet words with Narissa. She told her thanks for the good times. Hallos then handed her over to the slaughterhouse man. She trusted him and knew that when they arrived at Narissa’s final destination, a 10-minute drive away, he would back up the trailer, lead her out, and then it would happen. It would be quick. “People think that farmers don’t care,” says Hallos. “But we want it to be right for them. We do.” For Britain’s shepherds, Bonfire Night is traditionally tupping time, when the males impregnate the ewes for an April lambing. Hallos’s flock is a mixture of Scottish blackfaces and texels. The blackfaces are a hill breed most commonly found in the north of England and Scotland. They have black faces, curling horns and a shaggy, coarse coat. They are hardy and well suited to the whipping wind and sideways rain of a Yorkshire hillside in winter. The texel is a Dutch breed that is faster-growing and bred for meat. They live in the greener ground, closer to the farmhouse, which is more sheltered from the elements; the blackface are up on the moor. The tups can smell when the ewes are in heat. It’s best to get them going early in the day, so that they have calmed down by the evening. Rachel and Anna lead the tups into a sheep crush, which sounds painful, but is simply a metal enclosure, and paint their genitals in either pink or purple, so that they will know which tup has mounted which ewe. It’s a sunny autumn day. Afterwards, the newly impregnated ewes gambol over the hills, and the weary-looking tups swagger home alone, through the fields, tails swinging from side to side. In mid-November, Hallos travels to Scotland to collect a bull from a cattle sale. The bull came from Northern Ireland, which, in a post-Brexit economy, is a more complicated transaction than it used to be. “No one knows what paperwork you need,” she says. Hallos is a gregarious presence who’s a regular at the cattle sales of Scotland’s south-west coast. She knows everyone and everyone knows her. But the atmosphere is grim. One experienced farmer tells her that he’s just aiming to be in the second wave of farmers that go bust, not the first. These conversations tug at her like fleece on a barbed wire fence. When Hallos and her husband took Beeston Hall on after the death of Steve’s father in 2000, the finances were a mess. The bank wanted to repossess. Anna was just a baby at the time. Hallos found the number for the head of the bank’s agricultural department and pleaded with him to give them a chance. “We thought: ‘What have we got if we walk away, apart from debt? We might as well fight it out.’” It took them a decade to get out of that debt, and another decade to earn enough money to throw up the outbuildings they needed to house their livestock, and purchase equipment. Even now, Beeston Hall is far from profitable. It will probably never be profitable, unless they diversify, like many farmers across the UK. In 2018, they bought a holiday cottage next door, which provides a much-needed second source of income. Her landlord, Yorkshire Water, wants the family to continue to diversify. Hallos is considering selling beef directly to consumers, but it’s not as straightforward as simply keeping back some calves for slaughter. “We aren’t a factory floor,” she says. “It’s a long process.” Beeston Hall doesn’t “finish” its calves, meaning fatten them up before slaughter, instead it sells them at 11 months old to a finisher. This is because it’s not a mixed farm, that grows barley or wheat, which could be fed to the animals. To pivot to a direct-to-consumer model would require a complete restructuring of their business model. What Hallos doesn’t understand, after all these years, is what has happened to our food system. “How have we got it so wrong?” she says. “Because when something becomes too cheap, you don’t value it. But then there are genuine issues in this country where people can’t even afford it when it’s as cheap as it is. So how do you ever get people like us, who are right at the bottom of the supply chain, to get a fair price for our meat?” Anna leads the ewes off the hills for pregnancy scans. The UK has some of the cheapest food in the world, largely due to the colossal buying power of our supermarket chains, which compete with each other to drive down prices. “Farmers have always been a pawn in the retail price war,” says Tom Bradshaw, the vice-president of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU). “Because they are often small, disparate producers. They don’t have the power to influence up the supply chain.” Hallos agonises all the time over whether it’s the best thing for Anna and Sam to continue the family business, or whether it wouldn’t be better for them to do something more stable. Consumer price inflation has reached 5.1%, the highest rate since September 2011. “We’ve got our borrowing down as much as we possibly can, but there’s only so long you can hold tight,” she says. In late November, Hallos arranges the provisional sale of six heifers to another farmer, for finishing, subject to health checks. They go for £1,500 apiece. “That’s a good price,” she says, “which is helpful, bearing in mind that everything else is getting expensive.” Diesel has gone up from 58p to 79p a litre. Hallos is also a representative for the NFU, and she spends weeks driving around farmers’ annual general meetings, canvassing the mood. These meetings typically take place in the backroom of a pub, and they almost always go the same way: the farmers want to vent. Sometimes, they feel like therapy sessions. Arable farmers are stressed out because fertiliser prices have gone up from £200 to £700 a tonne. Fruit and vegetable growers are stressed because gas to heat the greenhouses is up by 17%, and they can’t get hold of CO2 to extend the shelf life of their produce, due to an international shortage. After Brexit, EU workers have returned to the continent, and UK farmers can’t recruit labour to replace them. And inflation keeps going up. Steve climbs a gate. “We’ve never seen the uncertainty we’re seeing now,” says Bradshaw. The main driver of anxiety is the end of the common agricultural policy – 2021 is the first year in which EU payments to farmers have been cut; 42% of English farms rely upon the policy to be profitable. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is piloting the sustainable farming incentive, which will pay grants to farmers that meet certain biodiversity and environmental obligations, but details are vague. “They’re still making the policy,” says Dr Ruth Little, a lecturer in human geography at the University of Sheffield. “But this is the biggest change to agriculture in over a generation, and agriculture works on long timescales. The worst thing for farmers is uncertainty. If you don’t know what you have to deliver, how are you supposed to plan?” Tenant farmers such as Hallos are most vulnerable to this post-Brexit period of adjustment. “They don’t have the asset base to get through this period of change,” says Bradshaw. Hallos feels the pressure, even if she tries to stay upbeat. “Just tell us what you want from us,” she says. “Because none of us know any more.” She has asked Sam and Anna to try to find a replacement source of income for their £60,000 basic payment. Anna is working shifts in the local pub, while Sam grits roads and works as a contractor, using their equipment on neighbouring farms. At one meeting in a pub in South Yorkshire, a young farmer asks Hallos when the general public will stop blaming them for everything: climate change, food prices, the rest of it. She tells him that most of the population have subcontracted their ability to feed themselves out to a small group of people called farmers. She tells him that they need to get better at explaining what they do on their farms, and how they look after their animals, to the public. She tells him not to be disheartened. “There was a silent epidemic of mental health problems in the agricultural sector pre-Covid,” says Little. “Covid plus Brexit uncertainty is a perfect storm. There needs to be support mechanisms in place for the agricultural sector.” She is particularly worried about farmers who may not want to embrace the government’s environmental-centred approach to farming. “We’re moving from a system where farmers like to produce good stock and have tidy fields, and part of their identity is about being a good farmer, meaning, a good food producer,” says Little. “This new system sets them up more as environmental stewards rather than food producers. People need to see themselves in the future of agriculture. We need to think about the reasons why people farm.” Hallos drives home in the dark, down winding country roads. It’s pitch-black, and cold. As she’s driving, sleet starts coming down. “It’s definitely winter. Here we go.” The weather in December is awful. Horizontal rain that makes your nose stream and your lips go numb. Rachel, Sam, Steve and Anna go to fetch in the last of the cows from the moor. The breeding cows know what’s coming, and start to trot home. Their calves follow. Crossing the A58, which traverses the farm, is always hairy, but they manage it OK. The cows bring themselves into the field and straight into the shed. They remember the way, from years gone past. “As if to say,” says Hallos, “thank God for that. We’re home.” The cows are able to pick their way home without prompting because they have hefted to the moor. “Hefted,” Hallos says, “means an animal understands the boundaries of the land, without there being physical barriers. It’s their sense of belonging. They know the routes and where to go to shelter from the weather. They know that because their mother taught them.” Jim the border collie. In mid-December, Anna finds a sheep dead in a field. There’s no explanation: this just happens sometimes. It might be a heart problem, or cancer. In heavy snowfall, sheep may hide beside a drystone wall. The snow blows over the top of them, and they get stuck. They die standing up. Anna fetches a tractor, puts the dead sheep into a bucket fixed to the front, and drives it home. She stores it in an outbuilding and slings a tarp over it. Hallos rings the knackerman, who collects and disposes of dead livestock. Normally, he would arrive the following day, but he’s struggling with staff shortages, due to Covid. He takes a week to collect it. Hallos is sitting in her kitchen, having a cup of tea and thinking about how much she’s looking forward to Christmas, when she gets a phone call from a private number. It’s a representative from the Animal and Plant Health Agency, a government department. A breeding cow she sold a few weeks ago was slaughtered, and the butcher found lesions inside it, meaning that it has bovine tuberculosis. Hallos’s stomach flips. She wants to say it’s a mistake, but the man on the end of the phone is clear. This has never happened to her before, in two decades of livestock farming. The impact on the business will be catastrophic. Best-case scenario, the entire herd has to be tested for TB. If the tests come back negative in 60 days, normal business can resume. Worst-case scenario, TB is found to be endemic throughout the entire herd – all the animals will have to be slaughtered. “We don’t own any land,” says Hallos. “Everything we own is walking around in the fields.” To make matters worse, it’s a nightmare trying to get hold of a vet, due to a nationwide shortage. The vet eventually arrives on a frigid January morning. All of the cows are brought out of the sheds and walk into a cattle crush. The vet shaves two small sections of the animal’s neck, and then pinches the skin together to measure the thickness. She performs the tuberculin skin test, injecting a combination of proteins into the skin of the neck. If the cow has been exposed to TB, this will trigger an immune response, and a lump will develop at the injection site. Three days later, the vet returns to check for lumps. It’s bad news. One of the cows has a lump on her neck. But the test result is inconclusive, meaning the vet has to return in March to do it again. Until she passes the test, none of the herd can leave the farm. Rachel quarantines the cow with her calf in a side shed. To make matters worse, they lose the sale of the six heifers. It’s a £9,000 loss, plus the associated costs of raising the heifers into cows. Hallos is trying to stay positive. She looks out of the living room window and sees four lambs in the front field. They’re running. For a moment, she wonders if a fox has got into the field and is chasing them, but then she realises that they are playing. It’s a beautiful, sunny day, and the animals take pleasure in it. She resolves to take pleasure in it also. Hallos brings in the hoggs from the fields. They are what’s left of last year’s spring lambs – the females who have been kept back for breeding. They are in to be haybitten. Because the lambs have never eaten hay – only grass or milk from their mothers – if offered, they will refuse it. But in the depths of winter, when the ground freezes and the grass stops growing, the farmers drive hay out into the fields to supplement the diet, especially when the sheep are carrying lambs and need extra energy. “If you don’t haybite them,” Hallos says, “the sheep will refuse to eat the hay and grow thinner and thinner.” Leading them into the shed, where they will live for a month, Hallos can smell the lanolin in the wool. A greasy, sour odour. She’s sensitive to smell; she can’t bear to eat roast lamb, because it reminds her of lambing season, and how the violent stench of afterbirth lingers on your clothes and your hands, no matter how much you wash. All the sheep have to be sheared in the summer, for welfare reasons. Blow flies lay their eggs in the wool, and maggots hatch and cause fly strike, an infection that can prove fatal if untreated. In pre-pandemic times, Hallos would take the wool to the British Wool Marketing Board, and it would auction it off to be spun into carpets for cruise ships and hotels. But when the pandemic started, the global wool market crashed. Hallos will get pennies on a tonne, if she’s lucky. “You think: ‘Hang on a minute. We’re meant to be living in a world where we want to use more sustainable materials. Why aren’t we doing anything with all this wool?’” A blackface hogg has climbed on top of the corn feeder and towers above the other animals. She is totally still, as watchful and imperious as a shaman officiating at a ceremony. There’s always one hogg that likes to dominate the rest. Like cows, sheep can be bullies, but they can also be arrogant, playful and smart. The sheep in the fields recognise the noise of the tractor in winter, and know it means Steve is bringing them hay, and they race over and jostle for prime position. In a fortnight, Hallos will scan the sheep, to see which are carrying lambs, and how many. The ones that aren’t pregnant will be sold. The frost will drain off the hills and the first leaf buds will appear on the trees around the reservoir. Hallos will prepare for the arrival of the spring calves and the lambs. She will deal with the vet, and the outcome of the TB scare, whatever may come. Hallos ponders the farm’s future. She will build up the farm, bit by bit, like a drystone wall that has collapsed in a gale. Dug deep, for a strong foundation. Stones stacked neat and flush as books on a bookshelf. But even a talented and conscientious farmer such as Hallos cannot protect her farm from the buffeting winds of Covid, Brexit, an increasingly globalised supply chain and inflation. The wall crumbles even as she restores it by hand. Another gust might bring down the whole thing. “It’s so demoralising sometimes,” says Hallos. “You think: ‘What is the point?’ But then you have to pick yourself up.” There are animals to be fed, and attended to. Sheep to be sheared, hay to be stacked, and then, when it is all over, a horse ride across sloping country fields on a sun-dappled evening. No other life would bring such joy. No other life would bring such difficulty.",News/Society,"The hidden life of a farmer: playful cows, imperious sheep – and a grinding struggle for survival",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/the-hidden-life-of-a-farmer-playful-cows-imperious-sheep-and-a-grinding-struggle-for-survival
2/22/2022,"Windfall-tax the rich, Rowan Williams, former archbishop of Canterbury proclaims. Start with a one-off seizure from the top 1% and then bring in a 1% wealth tax that could yield at least £70bn a year. Time at last for the poor to inherit the Earth – or at least a little sliver of it. The last two Covid years have seen tidal waves of wealth wash into the pockets of those already possessing it, just as the cost-of-living disaster drains funds from low- and middle-income households. The pandemic should open our eyes to an already grossly unequal country suddenly engulfed in extra unearned excess.  Williams’s forceful words are actually moderate in the context of what’s happening right now: property prices are rising at the fastest rate on record and the stock market is rocketing, while low earners fall into debt. “Spiralling inequality,” he says, is “deeply damaging to our collective morale and trust”. The super-rich with “vastly disproportionate rewards” should welcome a windfall tax not as a burden but as an “opportunity to build a sustainable economy that works for everyone”. That’s optimistic. But if the rich don’t see his commendable plea in that light, surely the top 1% can be ignored electorally? There are only 250,000 households in this bracket, owning a minimum of £3.6m (although many are worth vastly more). And squeezing the very rich is electorally popular: Denis Healey denied saying he’d squeeze them “until the pips squeak”, though he did it. Yet the electoral power of plutocrats is not in their puny voter numbers but in the command they hold of the ears of Tory ministers – especially those hyper-donors who allegedly buy their way into Boris Johnson’s secret “advisory board”. Keir Starmer, in the Observer, asks why nothing is done to clean up London as the “money-laundering capital of the world”? He suggests “Perhaps the answer can be found in the Tory party’s accounts”. The Tories operate in a world of extreme money, bolstered by Conservative party co-chairman Ben Elliot, whose luxury concierge service, Quintessentially, has helped him bring in a stack of mega-rich – and at times questionable – donors since Johnson appointed him in 2019. Meanwhile, the government turns a blind eye to the extraordinary winnings made by some in the Covid years. What will voters think of six companies alone making £16bn in excess profit from Covid? Rio Tinto, recently in the news for blowing up two ancient Aboriginal caves in Western Australia, is handing out a $16.5bn (£12bn) dividend. FTSE mining companies have made £42bn in extra profits. The big four banks are expected to announce annual profits exceeding £34bn – and pay £4bn in bonuses. Shares in the manufacturer Premier Foods, home to Mr Kipling, have risen by 237% during the pandemic. Gambling profits have soared. These are just a few examples. As everyone knows, while energy bills scorch households, oil and gas profits are rocketing, putting $38bn in profits into share buybacks for investors, not green investments. Labour would windfall-tax that excess: companies drilling in the North sea that can’t flee abroad to avoid tax. Labour’s last windfall tax, highly popular in its 1997 manifesto, recouped £5.2bn from privatised utilities sold off too cheaply in the 1980s. That shows what can be done if backed by public opinion. In this explosion of asset values, Williams is calling for a windfall tax on wealth of a much greater magnitude. He is right that extraordinary times call for radical remedies. National debts are stretching towards second world war proportions – and yet unlike in wartime, the government is making no call on private wealth contributions. In wartime, wealth was conscripted, so why not now? Covid greatly widened the wealth gap, the Resolution Foundation tells me, which will have profound consequences for social mobility and income inequality in the future. Instead, Tory MPs clamour for tax cuts, ignoring stricken public services. NHS waiting lists will rise for years. Despite urgent skill shortages, further education funding will still be far behind 2010 levels by 2025. Teachers and nurses are paid less in real terms than in 2010. Pupils have 9% less spent on them in real terms than in 2010, their music, arts, sport and drama devastated. Early years are perilously neglected. “We don’t promise the moon on a stick,” the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said recently, boasting of his prudence. Indeed he doesn’t. To him, “build back better” is all moonbeams. A one-off windfall tax of 10% on UK wealth would yield £1tn, says Prof Arun Advani of Warwick University. That’s how relatively little taken from relatively few, just once, could fund the regeneration of everything around us that matters. But that’s probably only useful as a thought experiment in this most tax-averse country, where we are taxed less than our EU neighbours. Ed Miliband’s modest mansion tax was a lesson in how reasonable steps are blown away by lobbyists and thinktanks funded by the rich. Take inheritance tax, the fairest and most hated: only one in 20 estates pays, mostly those worth more than £1m – yet the rich and their newspapers scare ordinary homeowners that it’s coming for them. Would they do that to something branded a “wealth windfall tax” on individuals? Follow the dictum of Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV’s finance minister: pluck maximum feathers from the goose with minimum hissing. The Institute for Fiscal Studies’ deputy director, Helen Miller, lists less hiss-inducing tax reforms with her elegant TaxLab showing how taxes are raised, with grotesque anomalies. Council tax revaluation would see bills in the north of England fall by 20%, because southerners pay a fraction of their true property values. Levelling up capital gains and rents so that all unearned income pays the same tax and national insurance would stop plutocrats disguising their income. Basic fairness is the first step, but a loud shout from a former archbishop for windfalling the wealthy is welcome. Deliberate misinformation means too few know about undertaxed riches cascading into the pockets of the few, bolstering the life chances of their heirs.

2/22/2022,"Russia faced western sanctions and bitter condemnation at the United Nations after Vladimir Putin ordered troops over the Ukrainian border into Moscow-controlled territories in the east of the country, which he had recognised hours earlier. With reports of Russian armoured columns advancing into the Donetsk and Luhansk regions under the guise of “peacekeepers” in the Russian-backed enclaves, the US imposed some limited sanctions and warned more would come on Tuesday. The UK is also due to unveil its own package of punitive measures.  Both the US and UK believe that the Russian entry into the eastern tip of Ukraine is a precursor for a more sweeping invasion. “This is the moment – the moment to stand up and defend the United Nations and our international order as we know it,” Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador to the UN, said. She cast doubt on Putin’s assertion that the Russian troops would take on a “peacekeeping” role in the Donetsk and Lugansk areas. “He calls them peacekeepers. This is nonsense. We know what they really are,” she said. The US withdrew its remaining diplomats in Ukraine on Monday, deploying them to Poland, as Putin’s move rattled markets around the world. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, appealed for strong sanctions as the only way of stalling further Russian encroachment. “World capitals don’t sleep now, regardless of their time zones,” Kuleba said on Twitter. “Ukraine insists: further Russian actions rely on how the world reacts. Russia must be in no doubt that the world talks the talk and walks the walk on sanctions.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made a defiant late night address to his nation, after the first reports of Russian troops were crossing into the country, into enclaves controlled by Moscow since 2014. “We are on our land. We don’t fear anything or anyone. We don’t owe anything to anyone. And we won’t give anything up,” Zelenskiy said. At the UN, Ukraine’s permanent representative, Sergiy Kyslytsya, compared Putin’s decrees recognising separatist regions in Ukraine to one for Georgia in 2008, saying: “The copying machine in the Kremlin works very well. Who is the next among the members of the UN?” It was at the UN that Russia felt its isolation most keenly, as three African council members: Kenya, Gabon and Ghana, spoke out against Moscow’s actions for violating Ukraine’s territorial integrity. A few weeks earlier, Kenya and Gabon had abstained on a Ukraine-related vote. On Monday night, Kenya’s permanent representative, Martin Kimani, delivered a powerful address, suggesting Russia learn to live with ethnic grievances just as African states have done. “Kenya and almost every African country was birthed by the ending of empire. Our borders were not of our own drawing,” Kimani said. “Had we chosen to pursue states on the basis of ethnic, racial or religious homogeneity, we would still be waging bloody wars these many decades later.” “We rejected irredentism and expansionism on any basis, including racial, ethnic, religious or cultural factors. We reject it again today,” he concluded. Russia, which currently chairs the security council, had tried to hold the late night meeting behind closed doors, but was overruled by a majority of council members. Vasily Nebenzya, the Russian permanent representative repeated Moscow’s unfounded claims that Ukraine was about to launch an attack on the eastern Moscow-backed enclaves, presented as a pretext for sending in Russian troops. “Allowing a new bloodbath in the Donbas is something we do not intend to do,” he said. Ukraine has denied any plans for an offensive, and independent reporting has shown no signs that one is imminent. India, the United Arab Emirates and Brazil, avoided mentioning Russia at the council session while urging negotiations. The Chinese permanent representative, Zhang Yun, made a very brief, non-committal statement, which observers said suggested that Beijing has yet to make up its mind. “This reads like a placeholder,” Bonnie Glaser, the director of the Asia programme at the German Marshall Fund, said. “China hasn’t decided what its policy response should be yet.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke to his Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, on Monday night, and according to the state department, “underscored the need to preserve Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.” On Monday night Ukrainian officials warned that Russian troops may have already entered separatist territory. The officials said local people in the town of Makiivka, 15km west of rebel-held Donetsk, saw what appeared to be Russian armoured vehicles on the move. One source – who declined to be named – said “a huge convoy of Russian armoured personnel carriers and other equipment has been travelling for one-and-a-half hours”. It was spotted heading north towards the city of Yasynuvata, also in the Donetsk region. Video released by Ukraine appeared to show a column of military vehicles moving in convoy along a road. The officials said it was not possible to tell if the troops belonged to the regular Russian army, or were from Russian-controlled separatist units. Putin announced the decision in a televised speech marked by the Russian leader’s visceral anger at a country he has called a “brother nation”. “Those who took the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise and don’t recognise any other solution to the Donbas problem besides the military,” Putin said. “Therefore I believe it is necessary to take a long-overdue decision to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic” – the Russian proxy states in east Ukraine.",News/World news,Russia strongly condemned at UN after Putin orders troops into eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/russia-strongly-condemned-at-un-after-putin-orders-troops-into-eastern-ukraine
2/22/2022,"There’s a time when it’s no longer winter, but it seems unwise to speak of spring. Before blossom, before warmth is a turning point felt rather than observed. This year it was distilled and formalised for me on an Imbolc pilgrimage to the Uffington White Horse in Oxfordshire, led by the apothecary Charlotte Pulver, the druid Chris Park and the singer-naturalist Sam Lee. I found myself barefoot in a chalk spring, shedding tears for a woman I’ve never met while hugging her sister, and later crouched in candlelight and heart-rhythm in the cramped chamber of the 5,500-year-old long-barrow of Wayland’s Smithy.  The next day in the Sam Wanamaker playhouse (the exquisite little sibling of London’s Globe theatre), we gorged on words and music as Robert Macfarlane and Johnny Flynn performed new songs inspired by the oldest of stories, The Epic of Gilgamesh. Those were songs of tree-felling and regret, quests and exploitation, pandemic and plague, love and death, and the dizzy moments on which great events seem to hinge and spin. I came home changed, to find home changed too. In my absence, a song thrush had begun making town-crier proclamations at first light and last, and the hazels had bloomed with male catkins long and louche, and female flowers like tiny passion-coloured explosions. A couple of days later, I join a tree-planting session in Kirby Misperton, North Yorkshire, on a farm bequeathed to the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust. It seems an unlikely reserve at first: stark fields and an embanked, straightened beck, two miles from the concrete slabs of an abandoned fracking operation, closer still to the site of the camp established by protesters. A place in need of healing. It’s a day’s work for 12 of us to get a thousand bare-rooted whips into the ground: rowan, hawthorn, blackthorn, alder buckthorn – we’re creating scrub rather than forest. I sing some of the new songs as I tuck in roots and my fingers break up clods of soil to pack around them. At dusk, a more fitting herald comes: a blackbird on a high hedge, head back, pouring gold from his own dark and atavistic well of inspiration. “Awake!” he cries. “Unfurl, take root and sing at the world to come.”  Country Diary is on Twitter at @gdncountrydiary",News/Environment, Country diary: A few days away from home and the song thrush starts up,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/22/country-diary-a-few-days-away-from-home-and-the-song-thrush-starts-up
2/22/2022,"Ben Roberts-Smith ordered the mock execution of an unarmed civilian during an SAS training drill in 2012, a former comrade has told the federal court in Sydney. The court also heard on Tuesday that Roberts-Smith discussed “blooding” soldiers on their first tour of Afghanistan – having them kill a person on operation – and said to a comrade that another fellow soldier should not register a bullying complaint against him: “You tell that cunt he better not saying anything, or I’ll get him charged for war crimes.”  Roberts-Smith, a recipient of the Victoria Cross, is suing the Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Canberra Times for defamation over a series of reports he alleges are defamatory and portray him as committing war crimes, including murder, as well as acts of bullying and domestic violence. The newspapers are pleading a defence of truth. Roberts-Smith denies any wrongdoing. On Tuesday, a former SAS comrade, anonymised before court as Person 19, appeared under force of subpoena as a witness for the newspapers, to give evidence on his service alongside Roberts-Smith. He told the court that during a training drill at the Lancelin barracks, his SAS patrol, led by Roberts-Smith, was conducting a “live-fire” exercise, training for an assault on an Afghan village. The exercise involved other soldiers dressed as Afghan non-combatants. He said that, towards the conclusion of the drill, the soldiers were standing in a semi-circle inside a mock compound, similar to those found in Afghan villages. One soldier was acting as an Afghan national, dressed in traditional clothing, and constrained, kneeling, facing a wall. Person 19 told the court Roberts-Smith said to a new soldier on the patrol, Person 10, “I want you to shoot the PUC”. PUC is a military acronym for “person under control”. “I remember that distinctly, it was unusual, I remember seeing the look on [the kneeling soldier’s] face. I remember Person 10 saying ‘bang’ or they shot the ground, to the effect that they had shot the person,” Person 19 said in his evidence. It is unlawful under international humanitarian law, and against the rules of engagement for Australian troops, to shoot a person under control who does not pose any threat. Person 19 also told the court of instructions given by Roberts-Smith and another senior SAS soldier, Person 31, about assaults on compounds during another 2012 training drill. Person 19 said Roberts-Smith and Person 31 had said drones watching the Australians’ actions would be “pushed off to observe another area so they weren’t observing what was happening in the compound”. “The officers would be kept outside the compound until we would be ready to receive them.” Person 19 told the court: “at which stage Mr Roberts-Smith said, ‘that’s when any people that we suspect of being enemy combatants, we take them into a room and shoot the cunts’.” Person 19 said the soldiers were told they could carry with them weapons or radios – known as “throw-downs” – which could be placed on the bodies of those killed, and “it could be submitted as evidence that they were killed during the assault”. Person 19 could not recall which of Roberts-Smith or Person 35 said which words about throw-downs but they were speaking collectively. Person 19 told the court Roberts-Smith had used the term “blooding” during a conversation at a Perth cafe in 2012. “I heard Mr Roberts-Smith say Person 10 needed to be blooded, to blood the rookie. He needed to prove himself. He then said I didn’t need to prove myself as I’d already done previous deployments.” Person 19 said he understood blooding to mean “new members of the troop or patrol who had never deployed before or had never shot anyone had to prove themselves by showing they had the … fortitude to shoot a prisoner if required”. Person 19 told the court that Person 10 had contacted him, while on deployment in 2012, alleging Roberts-Smith had punched him following an operation. Person 19 told the court he spoke with Roberts-Smith about the potential complaint, and said Roberts-Smith said: “You tell that cunt he better not saying anything, or I’ll get him charged for war crimes.” Last year, in his evidence to the court, Roberts-Smith said he never heard the term “blooding” until after he left the military, and said he had only heard of the term “throw-downs” in the context of them “being used by other nations”. Person 19 also told the court he met several times with journalist Chris Masters, a respondent in the case whom he regards as a friend, and discussed SAS matters, including rumours within the regiment that Roberts-Smith did not deserve his decorations. It was put to Person 19 he was giving evidence to support Masters’ defence in this case. “No. If I had a choice, I wouldn’t be here,” Person 19 said. During cross-examination, Person 19 said Masters had told him that Andrew Hastie – a former captain in the SAS and now the assistant defence minister – had had an “altercation” with Roberts-Smith in Afghanistan. Hastie is scheduled to give evidence later in this trial. Person 19 was also forced to defend his own military service in court. In 2012, five days before he was due to deploy to Afghanistan, Person 19 was court-martialled for taking body armour, ammunition and grenades off a military base in his private car, which was then stolen and involved in a fatal accident. Person 19 was prohibited from deploying to Afghanistan. Two years later, Person 19 was dismissed from the military for signing a false declaration about his living arrangements with his then girlfriend in a military-funded house, and was convicted of “recklessly gaining a financial advantage”. He was sentenced to 42 days confinement in a military prison. Under cross-examination, Arthur Moses SC, put it to Person 19 that he resented Roberts-Smith for raising the ammunition issue up the chain of military command. “You harbour anger towards him because he had to raise the issue of ammunition in your vehicle,” Moses said. “No,” Person 19 said. With the witness out of the room, Moses told the court Person 19 was “a witness with no credit” who was inconsistent in his evidence. “He flip-flops, especially when he gives evidence about hotly contested conversations.” Later, Moses put to Person 19 that he was “quite willing to swear a false statutory declaration”, and his evidence could not be relied upon. Person 19 said: “I lost a 14-year career to a couple of very silly errors of judgment.” Moses asked whether he was disappointed he was barred from going to Afghanistan in 2012. “It ruined my career,” Person 19 said. Moses said Person 19’s evidence was designed “to damage Mr Roberts-Smith”. “I completely reject that statement,” Person 19 said. “You’re giving false evidence to the court,” Moses said. “I disagree,” Person 19 responded.

2/22/2022,"Facebook has filed court documents rejecting claims by Australian billionaire Andrew Forrest that it should be held liable for cryptocurrency scam ads bearing Forrest’s unauthorised image, in part arguing the company’s terms of service protect it from liability. The social media giant has argued in court documents filed in California in January that because Forrest has a Facebook account, he has agreed to the company’s terms and conditions, which they allege protect it from liability.  Forrest launched civil proceedings against the social media giant in the superior court in San Mateo, California, alleging Facebook’s failure to stop scam ads appearing on the platform constituted a “misappropriation of likeness”, “aiding and abetting fraud” and “negligent failure to warn”. The ads began appearing in March 2019. These ads use images of celebrities or other well-known people in the regions they are targeting. They are presented as a news story claiming the celebrity has made a “big investment” and the banks are shocked by how well that investment has done. If you click on the ad, it takes you to a fake news story that includes a link claiming to be a cryptocurrency investment scheme. Forrest has separately commenced criminal proceedings in the Western Australian magistrates court alleging that Facebook has breached federal money laundering laws by failing to stop the ads. Those proceedings are expected to be mentioned for the first time in March. In the US court, Forrest has argued his reputation has been damaged by the scam ads and Facebook is not merely a platform, but the publisher of the ads. Forrest argues this is due to how Facebook actively targets users for ads based on their location and interests, and other information. “Facebook is not simply providing neutral tools for bad actors to carry out fraudulent schemes. Instead, Facebook is utilizing its sophisticated method of collecting data, and then using that data to engage its users for longer periods of time with information, advertisements, and other material, irrespective of what that content is,” the court filing states. “Facebook is directly involved with developing and enforcing a system that subjects its users to illegal content.” In its response, filed in court, Facebook has argued that it cannot be held liable on a number of grounds, including that it is protected by section 230 of the US Communications Decency Act, which limits the liability of websites for third-party content posted on those websites. Facebook has argued the claims were “the classic kinds of claims that [have been] found to be preempted by section 230” and uniformly rejected by US courts. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The company has also argued that because Forrest has a Facebook account and has agreed to the company’s terms of service, he cannot claim the company is liable. “Specifically, section 4.3 of the TOS makes clear that Facebook is ‘provided ‘as is’’, that Facebook ‘make[s] no guarantees that [the platform] always will be safe, secure, or error-free’, and that Facebook ‘do[es] not control or direct what people and others do or say’ and ‘[is] not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content)’.” Forrest’s next response is due on Tuesday, with Facebook’s subsequent response due in March, ahead of a hearing in mid-April.

2/22/2022,"Japanese women have outperformed men in medical school entrance exams for the first time since universities admitted they had deliberately failed female applicants to inflate the number of male doctors. According to new government data, 13.6% of female candidates passed exams at 81 medical schools last spring, compared with 13.51% of men.  It is the first time that women have fared better than their male counterparts since the education ministry started keeping records in 2013. The latest results are a reversal of those over the previous eight years, when the pass rate among men exceeded that of women by up to 2.05 percentage points. Japan’s academic world was shaken in 2018 by revelations that several medical schools had deliberately marked down female candidates, triggering accusations of institutional sexism and demands for greater transparency. Ten of the country’s most prestigious schools admitted that they had systematically discriminated against women to ensure a sufficient number of men were admitted. The gender-based manipulation of results came to light after Tokyo Medical University was alleged to have offered a place to the son of a senior education ministry official in return for a favour. The schools said they had deliberately failed female candidates due to concerns that women were more likely to quit their medical careers to start families amid a nationwide shortage of doctors. Of the schools that were found to have discriminated against female candidates, six had higher acceptance rates for women than for men in 2021. A higher percentage of women than men had passed at a small number of schools the year after the scandal, but this is the first time the trend has extended nationwide. An education ministry official said the data proved that women were no longer at a disadvantage when they applied for places at Japan’s highly competitive medical schools. “It has become clear that the acceptance rate will not be low only for female applicants,” the official told Kyodo news agency. The proportion of female doctors in Japan is still significantly lower than in other developed economies, however. A 2018 survey by the health ministry found that just 21.9% of doctors were women, the lowest share among countries belonging to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, in which the average was 46% in 2015.",News/World news,"Women outperform men in Japanese medical school entrance exams, years after testing scandal",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/women-outperform-men-in-japanese-medical-school-entrance-exams-years-after-testing-scandal
2/22/2022,"The New South Wales transport minister, David Elliott, has revealed he went to bed while his department was grappling with whether to shut down Sydney’s rail network on Sunday night. Elliott said on Tuesday that the government had withdrawn its application against the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) in the Fair Work Commission (FWC), and would negotiate with them instead.  He said reduced services would continue today and potentially tomorrow but he hoped dropping the fair work action would result in a compromise soon. During an extraordinary press conference on Tuesday the transport minister conceded he was not aware in advance of the decision to suspend train services in the early hours of Monday, nor did he inform the premier, Dominic Perrottet, of the looming shutdown, because he went to bed before a decision was made. Despite telling reporters that he had an “inkling” of what was to come, Elliott said he had not informed Perrottet “because I had no confirmation and I didn’t know exactly what action Transport for NSW would be taking”. While stating that he was “OK” that officials hadn’t called him at 12.43am when the call was made to shut down the system – “because I may not have answered the phone” – Elliott said he was “asking for information” about the decision. “We pay these people to do their job and I accept the fact that at 12.43am it was their judgment call; as executives they needed to use their discretion and close the system,” he said. “Did I like it? Absolutely not. Am I still asking for information and details to justify the decision? Absolutely.” Elliott also admitted during the press conference that he had yet to see a copy of a risk assessment reportedly carried out by transport before the department made the call to shut down the network, saying he had “requested” to see it. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning After accusing the rail union on Monday of “terrorist-like activity” and “hijacking the city” over what he incorrectly labelled a “strike” action, Elliott revealed on Tuesday that the government had withdrawn its FWC application. In markedly more conciliatory language, he said that he had met with the union on Tuesday and thanked RTBU NSW secretary, Alex Claassens, after the meeting. He said his earlier comments on Monday had come “on a day of high emotion”. “The people of Sydney were certainly disenfranchised but it was industrial action, and the union and I had a chat about that,” he said. “Going forward it is on the advice of senior counsel that the government will withdraw the matter currently before the Fair Work Commission ... in the interests of transparency and goodwill.” Earlier on Tuesday, union officials said they had met with Elliott for “bloodletting” and negotiations. Claassens said the meeting with Elliott was “a little bit tense” at first, accusing him and Perrottet of being “out there verbalising” the union. “We had a little bit of a bloodletting but after that we got on with the business of doing what we should have been doing all along and that is having a productive conversation about the way forward and how we can fix some of the things that are broken,” Claassens said to 2GB after the meeting. The union’s industrial action will continue, with trains expected to continue at a similar frequency on Tuesday and Wednesday before he hoped the commission could “resolve” the matter. “We will do everything we can to try and restore normal services as quickly as possible,” Claassens said. “There’s a deadline on us anyway because [the government wants] to run the normal timetable from the 28th. “We’ve all got a goal that we’ve got to try and work to and we’ll try and do what we can, but we do need them to meet us halfway on some of these issues.” Opposition leader Chris Minns said it was “implausible” that the minister was not informed of the shutdown before the general public. “If it’s true, it’s a complete failure of the transport system,” he said. “The minister is responsible and if he wasn’t told about it, what’s he going to do about it?” Minns called for the risk assessment used by Transport for NSW to make the decision to be made public. Monday’s disruption caused commuter chaos across the city, with effects felt across the network including routes connecting Sydney to the Blue Mountains, the south coast and Newcastle. Buses were put on to replace some services but commuters were told to allow for extra travel time.

2/22/2022,"If you were a disadvantaged child today in an Australian school, chances are high that a majority of the other children in your school would also be disadvantaged. Your school would most likely need more resources to have experienced special education experts; it probably would not have qualified mathematics and science teachers, and nobody to teach music. In this respect, Australia is an outlier among the richest countries in the world. No other wealthy nation concentrates disadvantaged children into disadvantaged schools like we do. That concentration effect has increased the socio-economic segregation between schools and has widened the achievement gap between affluent and poorer children that has been evident in international education comparisons and was confirmed by the latest Naplan data.  Ten years ago, the Australian government launched the Gonski review of funding for schooling, a landmark proposal to correct the flaws in how our national resources are spent in education. A decade later, we are back to the debates about what effect money has on student achievement. Critics have claimed the Gonski review offered a flawed model for school funding and has therefore not achieved its aims. It is time to forget that review, they insist. We argue that Australia needs to fund schools according to the original Gonski review recommendations now more than ever. Here is why. The funding formula for schools in Australia was fundamentally flawed prior to the Gonski review in 2011. That is why the review was commissioned. The flawed formula meant that when more money was pumped into education, schools that needed funding the least were getting more funding while schools serving mostly disadvantaged students were not. Gonski’s solution to fixing persisting inequalities in Australian education correctly assumed that funding schools more fairly would benefit not just children with disadvantages but indeed all children. This was based on recommendations offered by the OECD, evidence by international research and advice by our own education experts. The evidence is overwhelming that money matters in education, especially for disadvantaged students. For example, Nobel prize-winning economist David Card has established a causal relationship between education expenditure and student achievement. Furthermore, recent meta-analysis found positive impacts from increased school funding on student outcomes. Ten years on from the Gonski review being debated in public, the question is: Were the recommendations from the Gonski review right, and are they still relevant today? The answer requires consideration of the two aspects crucial to success of any reform. Firstly, the quality of the recommendations, and then how accurately and successfully those recommendations were implemented. The Gonski review recommended that students, via the school they attend, should receive the funding they need to succeed calculated on their individual circumstances. This is the needs-based school funding model that is the internationally adopted standard in all high-performing education systems today. The model recommended a base level of funding for each student with additional loadings funded for students dependent on their individual characteristics, including disability and socio-economic status. Not surprisingly, public schools receive more of this funding given they enrol more than four out of five disadvantaged students. There is overwhelming Australian and international research showing that family background is a major factor explaining student achievement. Consequently, students’ socio-economic circumstances need to be considered when schools are resourced. The specific loadings in the funding formulas were designed to allow schools to better support students who face the sorts of disadvantages that affect their learning before they even arrive at the front gate of their school in the morning. This principle of needs-based funding of schools is as sound today as it was a decade ago – if not more, given that economic and educational inequalities will continue to play a destructive role in the post-pandemic recovery. Unfortunately, while the reforms and recommendations were right, their implementation has failed to deliver on the promise of the Gonski review. So, what went wrong? States and territories have implemented the Gonski’s recommendations inconsistently and the special funding deals for non-government schools were not removed. Most significantly, the commonwealth government put a straitjacket on the reforms on day one by declaring that no school would lose any money. That meant money that could have flowed to underfunded schools continued flowing to overfunded non-government schools. It is important to keep in mind that the extra funds that were allocated to schools started to flow in 2015 and only started as a trickle. Since then, schools serving disadvantaged students have seen significant increases in funding, not just because of the extra money but also thanks to Gonski’s changed funding formula. The Gonski funding reforms and the extra money has improved the services and support that many schools are now able to offer. But the fact is that all disadvantaged public schools, at least in New South Wales, are still underfunded. At the same time, during the past decade, public money to private schools has increased at five times the rate of public schools. The Gonski review had the potential to be an absolute gamechanger in Australian education 10 years ago. The momentum to make those much-needed reforms in school funding was watered down by ideological debates and political posturing. Consequently, the Gonski’s recommendations were not implemented as intended, and we can only speculate what the situation in our education would be today if we had kept the promise.

2/22/2022,"Equality advocates have blasted the prime minister, Scott Morrison, for backing a “divisive and unnecessary” push by Tasmanian senator Claire Chandler to allow sporting groups to exclude transgender people from single-sex sports. Campaigning in the Tasmanian marginal seat of Lyons on Tuesday, Morrison said he thought Chandler’s proposed private member’s bill to amend the Sex Discrimination Act was “terrific” and he had encouraged her to pursue it.  Under Chandler’s “save women’s sports” bill, which she introduced to the Senate earlier this month, changes would be made to the Sex Discrimination Act to “clarify” that the operation of single-sex sport on the basis of biological sex was not discriminatory. While the bill has little chance of being debated in the House of Representatives before the election, Morrison said he supported the legislation, which has been criticised by equality advocates. “I support it, as Claire knows. I think it’s a terrific bill and I’ve given her great encouragement,” Morrison said. “Claire is a champion for women’s sport and I think she’s been right to raise these issues in the way that she has. Well done, Claire.” But Charlie Burton, from Equality Tasmania, said the bill would strip transgender people of their “right to live as we are, casting us into an unequal, uncertain and unsafe status in the eyes of the law.” Burton said transgender women had been playing women’s sport and accessing women’s services for many years without any of the problems predicted by Chandler. “Tasmanian sporting organisations have been actively seeking guidance on how to be more inclusive, not less, with strong support from the Tasmanian government,” Burton told Guardian Australia. “We reject attempts to sow fear and division about policies that have worked well and have made Tasmania a better place for everyone.” Anna Brown, the chief executive of Equality Australia, said sporting groups had been working hard for decades to ensure inclusivity for trans and gender diverse people, saying “sport should be for everyone”. “In supporting this cruel, divisive and unnecessary bill, the prime minister once again underestimates the community’s support for trans and gender diverse children,” Brown said. “The Senate must act decisively and with the same conviction as their lower house colleagues by standing for the inclusion of trans kids by rejecting this bill in its entirety.” Brown said that the Sex Discrimination Act already allowed for discrimination on the grounds of sex, gender identity or intersex status by excluding people from competing in sport, where strength, stamina and physique was relevant. “Instead of considering how these exemptions could be narrowed, the Chandler bill would go further, and for the first time allow discrimination against children under the age of 12 years,” she said. According to the bill’s explanatory memorandum, the legislation intends to “ensure that organisers are not limited in their ability to operate single-sex sport by the threat of complaints of unlawful discrimination”. “The primary policy intent of the Bill is to acknowledge that categorisation by sex is a necessary and important mechanism to provide sporting participation and competitive opportunities for females. “It seeks to ensure that women’s single-sex sport is protected and encouraged, and that a male person is not entitled to demand inclusion into women’s sport on the basis of gender identity.” In introducing the bill, Chandler said that clubs faced the risk of legal action as the Sex Discrimination Act had “been used as a weapon” to pressure sporting organisations to allow males to play women’s sport. The prime minister’s support for Chandler’s push comes after the Coalition’s recent failed attempt to legislate religious discrimination laws after attempts to ensure transgender students were protected from discrimination. Five Liberal MPs crossed the floor to ensure the protection of gender non-conforming students under the Sex Discrimination Act, prompting the government to shelve its religious discrimination bill after a backlash from religious groups and faith-based schools. Burton said the debate over the treatment of trans children that accompanied the religious discrimination bill had seen “overwhelming” public and parliamentary support for protecting young trans people from discrimination, suggesting Morrison was “out-of-step with a country that prides itself on a fair go for everyone.” “In the past few weeks the prime minister has shown a complete lack of empathy for trans and gender diverse Australians and now he is using us as a political football. “We completely reject the cynical abuse of trans people as a weapon in the prime minister’s political and electoral game playing.” Brown also pointed to the “overwhelming outpouring of support”, including from within the Coalition, shown towards trans and gender diverse children during the debate on religious discrimination laws. “We know an overwhelming majority of people in Australia believe that trans and gender diverse people deserve the same rights and protections as other Australians, a fact that the Prime Minister failed to understand when he refused to fulfil his promise to protect trans kids in religious schools during the Religious Discrimination Bill debate.” North Sydney MP Trent Zimmerman, one of the five MPs who crossed the floor against the wishes of Morrison, published a letter and drawing on Facebook on Monday from a young constituent thanking him for “crossing the floor for my trans bro”. “After two weeks in Canberra coming home and finding this in my mail today meant the world to me,” Zimmerman said. Morrison made the remarks in support of Chandler’s bill while campaigning in the eastern Tasmanian seat of Lyons, where he announced an $804m Antarctica package to be spent over the next decade. The prime minister said the package ensured “Australia had eyes” on Antarctica, where China was becoming increasingly assertive. “Where others who have different objectives to us, well, it’s an opportunity for us to be there and make sure that we’re protecting Antarctica from more exploitative interests,” he said. Morrison also spoke about Russia’s incursion into Ukrainian territory, saying threats of violence were “being used to seek to advantage a nation’s position over others”. “Russia should step back, it should unconditionally withdraw, back behind its own borders and stop threatening its neighbours,” Morrison said. “It’s unacceptable, it’s unprovoked, it’s unwarranted, and Russia should understand that by seeking to invade another country, that this cannot advantage them, and it would seriously and significantly cost Russia.”",News/Society,Scott Morrison backs bill that allows exclusion of transgender people from single-sex sports,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/22/scott-morrison-backs-bill-that-allows-exclusion-of-transgender-people-from-single-sex-sports
2/22/2022,"Mask rules are set to be relaxed in Australia’s three biggest states, with authorities also considering removing isolation requirements for household contacts of Covid-19 cases as part of a “big shift” towards living with the virus. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced that from 11:59pm on Friday, the public health recommendation for Victorians to work or study from home will be removed and masks will only be required in certain settings including public transport, hospitals and primary schools, and for workers in hospitality, retail and large events.  It aligns with a similar plan which will take effect in New South Wales from Friday. “We’re going to a situation on Friday where there are essentially no Covid rules, or so few that it’s unrecognisable to what it was a year ago, and indeed what it was two years ago,” Andrews said on Tuesday. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, also said her government would relax the requirement to wear masks in most indoor settings, from 6pm on 4 March. She told parliament the state was now confident that the peak of the Omicron wave had passed. “Mr Speaker smiles are back. We can put our masks away,” she said. Queensland will also scrap density limits for private homes, weddings and funerals and there will be no limits in food courts, hairdressers, gyms, private venues and universities from 4 March. Meanwhile, Andrews revealed he was in discussions with the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, on a plan that would allow asymptomatic household contacts of Covid-19 cases to leave isolation to attend work. “That could be connected to third doses, although that would be more an honesty thing – you wouldn’t be able to prove it, Andrews said. “It will be another way of trying to encourage people to go and get a third dose. “What we know as we head into winter, we’ve got to do everything we can to try and have a better outcome when it comes to furloughing [and] as RATs become more and more available.” Workers in several critical industries including emergency services, education, food distribution, transport and freight were given an exemption from isolation requirements when a family member tested positive in mid-January. They are required to wear a mask at all times, travel directly to work and take regular rapid antigen tests. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, said this system had proved effective. “It has worked well with our nurses. People have been very responsible. If they’ve had symptoms, they’ve not come to work.” Hunt said. Andrews defended the decision to extend mask rules for students in grades three to six as the vaccination rate among the age group is lower than anticipated, among other considerations. According to data from the department of health on Monday, 54.2% of Victorians aged 5 to 11 years old have had one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Just 344 of the more than 7,000 vaccine doses administered on Monday were for children in the age group. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning From Monday Victorian public hospitals will be able to resume all surgery, with capacity to be assessed based on staff levels and Covid-19 demand. Private hospitals will be able to resume surgery at up to 100% capacity. In announcing the new settings, health minister Martin Foley also extended the deadline for some workers required to receive three doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The third dose deadline for education workers who had their second dose on or before 25 October will be extended by a month to 25 March, while fully vaccinated workers who are not yet eligible will have three months and two weeks from the date of their second dose. Workers who are recent international arrivals must get a third dose within four weeks of arrival. “We’re balancing the need to support our health system with the benefits of easing restrictions in a careful and sensible way,” Foley said.

2/22/2022,"Britney Spears has landed a “record-breaking” publishing deal for a tell-all memoir about her rise to fame, her relationship with her family and her experience living under a conservatorship for more than a decade. Page Six reported on Monday that publisher Simon & Schuster had secured the deal for the pop star’s memoir for as much as US$15m (£11m, A$20.8m) after a massive bidding war involving multiple publishers.  An unnamed source told Page Six that “the deal is one of the biggest of all time, behind the Obamas”. The president and first lady signed a deal worth an estimated US$65m to write multiple books for Penguin Random House in 2017. Guardian Australia has reached out to Simon & Schuster for comment. The deal comes months after Spears successfully fought a court-ordered conservatorship, which had been put in place by her father, Jamie Spears, for almost 14 years. The conservatorship, typically for older or infirm people who can no longer make decisions for themselves, was instigated in 2007 after a period of mental illness for Spears. Rumours spread that the singer was being held in the conservatorship against her will, which lead to the creation of the #FreeBritney movement. In 2021 Spears gave public testimony about the conservatorship for the first time, telling a Los Angeles judge that she had been forced to work by conservators despite begging for breaks, and that she had no control over her finances, was denied her wish to marry her boyfriend, and was barred from removing her birth control despite her wish to have a third child. “I’ve been in shock. I am traumatised,” Spears said. “I just want my life back.” The judge suspended her father from the conservatorship in September, before it was lifted entirely in November. Spears said soon after that she believed her family members “should all be in jail” for the “demoralising and degrading” treatment she says she experienced under the arrangement. Spears recently publicly condemned her sister, Jamie Lynn, who made allegations about the singer’s mental health while promoting her own memoir on Good Morning America. Jamie Lynn alleged in the interview last month that Spears had once locked them both in a room while holding a knife and described her behaviour over the years as “erratic, paranoid and spiralling”. In response, Spears accused her sister of “sell[ing] a book at my expense”. Her lawyer issued a strongly worded cease-and-desist to Jamie Lynn, asserting that Spears would “no longer be bullied” by her family. “Although Britney has not read and does not intend to read your book, she and millions of her fans were shocked to see how you have exploited her for monetary gain. She will not tolerate it, nor should she,” the letter read. Last week, Spears was invited to US Congress to discuss her conservatorship legal battle, with two members of the House of Representatives writing to her to ask her to speak about her “empowering” story and “the emotional and financial turmoil you faced within the conservatorship system”.",Arts/Music,Britney Spears lands ‘record-breaking’ book deal for tell-all memoir,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/22/britney-spears-lands-record-breaking-book-deal-for-tell-all-memoir
2/22/2022,"Colombia has decriminalised abortion during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, adding to a recent string of legal victories for reproductive rights in Latin America. The South American country’s constitutional court ruled five against four to decriminalise the procedure on Monday evening. The decision follows a series of rulings in Mexico and Argentina that lowered barriers to abortion.  Previously, abortion in Colombia was allowed only where there was a risk to the life or health of the pregnant mother; the existence of life-threatening foetal malformations; or when the pregnancy was the result of rape, incest or non-consensual artificial insemination. “We celebrate this ruling as a historic victory for the women’s movement in Colombia that has fought for decades for the recognition of their rights,” said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty International, in a statement. “Women, girls and people able to bear children are the only ones who should make decisions about their bodies.” “Now, instead of punishing them, the Colombian authorities will have to recognise their autonomy over their bodies and their life plans,” Guevara-Rosas, went on to say. As the ruling was handed down, protesters in favour of access to abortion clad in green – the colour adopted by the pro-choice movement – celebrated in front of Colombia’s constitutional court in downtown Bogotá, the capital. Anti-abortion protesters also demonstrated against the ruling. Abortion rights groups, collectively known as the Green Wave, sued to have abortion removed from the penal code. The movement had previously seen the constitutional court decide not to rule on the matter several times in the past two years. Reproductive rights groups estimate that as many as 400,000 abortions are performed each year in Colombia, with only 10% carried out legally. During 2020, at least 26,223 unsafe abortions were carried out across Colombia, according to Profamilia – a local reproductive healthcare provider. According to Causa Justa, a Colombian women’s rights coalition, at least 350 women were convicted or sanctioned for abortions between 2006 and mid-2019, including at least 20 girls under the age of 18. Latin America, a traditionally conservative region with a powerful Catholic and evangelical Christian lobby, has some of the world’s most restrictive abortion laws, often banning the procedure outright. In El Salvador, dozens of women have been jailed for homicide after suffering obstetric emergencies. “We applaud the constitutional court’s legal and political courage in recognising that women and girls are not second-class citizens,” said Paula Avila-Guillen, an international human rights lawyer and executive director of the Women’s Equality Center, based in New York. “In constitutionally protecting our autonomy over our own bodies and lives, the court is changing the lives of millions of vulnerable women and girls disproportionally harmed by abortion restrictions.” “We celebrate with Colombia’s Green Wave movement as the country becomes the third Latin American country to decriminalise abortion in the last two years,” Avila-Guillen said. “We know this will have a ripple effect in other countries in Latin America that have yet to take this step toward human rights and social justice.” Mexico’s supreme court decriminalised abortion last year, while parliamentarians in Ecuador last week eased regulations which now allow access to abortion in cases of rape. “While today we are celebrating this historic decision, the Green Wave is strong and growing, and the fight for reproductive rights and justice will not end until every person can access high-quality sexual and reproductive healthcare when and where they need it,” said Eugenia Lopez Uribe, the International Planned Parenthood Foundation’s regional director for Americas and the Caribbean region, in a statement.",News/Global development,Colombia legalises abortion in move celebrated as ‘historic victory’ by campaigners,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/22/colombia-legalises-abortion-in-move-celebrated-as-historic-victory-by-campaigners
2/22/2022,"Scott Morrison’s efforts to politicise Australia’s complex relationship with China seems to be further soiling his own flagging reputation. Like a bull in the proverbial, he has spent the past fortnight bombarding the airwaves with hastily googled dossiers and cold war-era panics to suggest an Albanese government would become an antipodean branch office of the Beijing Politburo.  Large sections of the national gallery have embraced his China pivot, breathlessly reporting the attacks on Labor, amplifying intelligence community blowback and catastrophising operational incidents that would normally demand sober assessment rather than tabloid splashes. But this week’s Guardian Essential Report suggests the Australian public is neither as excitable nor gullible as sections of the media, with Labor regarded as the party better placed to manage Australia’s relationship with China. These results will seem counterintuitive to those of us who follow politics closely and are conditioned to assume the Coalition has a national advantage on national security. But when this issue is laid out in the context of Australia’s interests rather than the generality, the China attack does not appear to be working. The most effective scare campaigns connect with disengaged voters in a concrete way. For all its artifice, the 2019 assault on Labor’s plans to rein in tax concessions spoke to the hip pocket. So too Keating’s “no GST” demolition of John Hewson in 1993. Howard scared voters on interest rates in 2004 and Labor nearly did the same from opposition with Medicare in 2016. When incumbents have won elections on national security scares, they have done so when the issue was already dominating the public discourse in a way that people saw a direct connection with their personal wellbeing. Robert Menzies’ “reds under the bed” demolition of Herbert Vere Evatt in 1955 was in the heat of the cold war where Australia’s loyalties were clear, Soviet spies were being expelled and his political opponents were literally splitting down the middle. Howard’s “turn back the boats” election in 2001 was prosecuted in the aftershocks of the September 11 terror attacks. The latest attacks on Labor over China are different. While Australian politics has moved from a broad consensus on engaging with China to a more adversarial outlook as Xi Jinping has consolidated power, there is not the same immediate heat in the issue. Indeed, according to another question in this week’s report, the vast majority of voters see China as a complex issue to be managed rather than a threat to be confronted. In other words, the clear majority of Australians support a position which is the polar opposite to the government’s current tub-thumping. In fact, the only group of voters who see the Coalition as being better equipped to manage the China relationship are those in the minority who see China as a threat to be confronted. In this context, you can make the argument the prime minister is really doing nothing but talking to his base. And not even all of the base. For those in business relationships with China or in industries with trade exposure, the relationship has far greater meaning than a set of politicised debating points. On our figures, that includes a majority of Coalition voters. The implications of these findings are clear for Labor as well. Rather than being drawn into defending every nuanced statement made in the party’s name over the past decade it can safely characterise this as simply another distraction with the very real potential to undermine the national interest. And let’s not ignore the political risk inherent in the China gambit. An estimated 6% of Australians identify as Chinese-Australian, with numbers concentrated in some of the more marginal Coalition seats, especially Sydney’s Banks and Reid where well-credential Asian Australian candidates are standing for Labor. Further muting the prime minister’s attacks is his own credibility as the attack dog. Morrison’s personal approval has deteriorated another five points into net negative over the past month (44% approve/49% disapprove), while Labor leader Anthony Albanese is in positive territory for the first time (42% approve/ 39% disapprove). And on a raft of personal attributes, the prime minister’s stocks are in freefall. Looking at these numbers, the China strategy appears more like a Hail Mary from a leader flailing for an issue to galvanise fear of likely change than a seriously constructed voter persuasion proposition. These are the figures of a leader who has burnt most – if not all – of his political capital, who the public see as untrustworthy, out of touch and lacking vision. When considering the mishandling of the China card, the diminished stature of the dealer cannot be discounted. Of course, the PM may have a grander plan, a constant drip, drip of “on-water incidents”, maybe a round of Petrov-style expulsions of Chinese diplomats or academics. Perhaps a Russian invasion of the Ukraine will further heighten local anxiety about the state of the world. More likely the only national defence consideration on this issue is the one to keep him in power. We know Morrison is at heart a marketeer, testing messages on the run and iterating them until they stick. It took him months of tortious analogy to come up with “the Bill we can’t afford”. But there’s a broader principle in design and innovation that he would be well served embracing: when it comes to China it is in the national interest for him to “fail fast” and move on to his next confected scare campaign.

2/22/2022,"Britain’s urban hedgehogs are showing signs of recovery, according to a new report, but rural populations have fallen by as much as 75% in some regions in just 20 years. The charismatic prickly creature, voted the UK’s favourite mammal in 2016, has experienced a dramatic fall in numbers since the turn of the millennium due to loss of habitat, attacks by dogs, vanishing prey and being killed by traffic. However, new analysis of hedgehog surveys has revealed a stark distinction between the fortunes of the town and country hedgehog, with clear signs the urban population has stabilised and may even be on the up.  Counting the nocturnal mammal is difficult, with the total UK population believed to be about 879,000 in 2018. They are now listed as vulnerable to extinction in Britain’s red list for mammals and are the subject of significant conservation efforts, with campaigns to create “hedgehog highways” to connect habitats and more than 100,000 “hedgehog champions”. The State of Britain’s Hedgehogs 2022 report, produced by the People’s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS), brings together data from five ongoing surveys, with the two urban counts showing an upward trend and an estimated 200,000 to 250,000 hedgehogs in suburban and inner-city green spaces. “We’ve known for a long time there has been a historic decline in hedgehogs. But the report highlights the difference between urban and rural populations,” said Fay Vass, head of the BHPS. “The rural populations are continuing to plummet. They’ve been declining by 30% to 75% across different areas of the countryside since the year 2000. In contrast, the urban hedgehog seems to have stabilised and might even be starting to recover after having previously also been in freefall. So that’s a glimmer of hope.” The outlook for rural hedgehogs remains bleak, according to the report. While the east Midlands and east of England are home to some of the country’s largest population densities, they have also experienced significant declines, falling 74% and 35% respectively since 1994. In the last decade, the loss has been a third and a quarter of their respective hedgehog populations, according to the report. The mammals, which have been in Britain for at least half a million years, are primarily threatened by habitat loss and the accompanying lack of prey such as beetles and earthworms. Conservationists are trying to better understand the declines in the countryside and are working with farmers to help them better manage their land for the animals. Hugh Warwick, an ecologist who is leading a national campaign to make hedgehog highways a legal requirement on new housing developments, said: “We’ve got a slight uptick [in urban populations]. That’s really exciting but we must be cautious. It’s got to be put in the context of a massively degraded situation already.” To help the animal’s recovery, Warwick encourages gardeners to embrace messier gardens. “We must get rid of the cult of tidiness. It’s an absurd cult, which is driven by gardening programmes and glossy magazines. Gardens should be a place that we share with nature,” he said. Researchers at Nottingham Trent University are also investigating the relationship between badger and hedgehog populations, with evidence that the presence of badgers negatively affects the prickly creatures. Most abundant in the south-west of England and south Wales, badgers prey on hedgehogs and compete with them for food.

2/22/2022,"The number of women in FTSE 100 boardroom roles has jumped to 39.1% from 12.5% 10 years ago, data has revealed, even as equality charities said progress for women in senior leadership roles was severely lagging. In 2020, 36.2% of boardroom roles on the index were held by women, climbing dramatically from 26.6% in 2016, the global data company BoardEx found. However, the Fawcett Society said the figures do not capture the “shocking lack of diversity” laid bare in its 2022 Sex and Power Index, with “women of colour, disabled women and LGBTQ people missing from positions of power”.  Jemima Olchawski, the Fawcett Society’s chief executive, welcomed the progress but said: “The devil is in the detail here. In the majority of boardrooms men continue to be overrepresented. When we look at the most senior positions of CEO and chair the progress is painfully slow.” Women make up only eight of the chief executives at the UK’s top 100 listed companies, leading some observers to argue that while progress is being made on gender targets, advances on women in senior leadership roles have stalled. The business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, said the BoardEx figures were evidence the UK’s “voluntary, business-led approach” to equality is working “without the need for mandatory quotas” as deployed in countries such as Germany. However, the Fawcett Society pushed back, with Olchawski saying “the voluntary approach has real limits” that mean “the laggards can simply opt out”. She called for a government requirement for companies to publish actions plans. According to the FTSE 100 figures, the UK climbed to second in international ranking of 12 similar countries – behind only France on almost 44% – rising from fifth place last year. The data refers to boardroom roles at the 100 largest companies by market capitalisation listed on the London Stock Exchange. Laura Whitcombe, a global campaign manager at the 30% Club, said there has been some great progress but added: “To focus on the boards could distract from the fact that we’re not making much progress at the executive level. “The pipeline of women progressing throughout organisations – right up to the top, to those executives that form the executive committee – that pipeline has got a bottleneck.” Women in boardroom roles for the top 250 companies is lower, at 36.8%, compared with 33.2% in 2020. Olchawski said it is “shocking” there are no women of colour on the FTSE 100 chief executive list. “We must break down the barriers that prevent women, in all their diversity, rising to the top,” she said. The FTSE Women Leaders Review, an independent government-supported organisation that reports progress on women’s representation and suggests recommendations, increased its voluntary target for FTSE 350 companies from 33% to 40% of board positions by 2025. “We know there is much more work to do and no shortage of experienced, capable women, ambitious for themselves and their company across all sectors of business today,” said Denise Wilson, the chief executive of the FTSE Women Leaders Review, who also urged progress in leadership roles. The data showed that 72 of the UK’s top 350 companies are still below a previous 33% target for women on boards. Liz Truss, the minister for women and equalities, said: “It is excellent to see the progress being made but we know there is more to be done.” She said the government plans to put forward measures to advance workplace equality but gave no further details.",News/Business,Number of women in FTSE 100 boardroom roles up to 39% in a decade,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/number-of-women-in-ftse-100-boardroom-roles-up-in-a-decade
2/22/2022,"China’s national defence ministry has accused the Australian defence force of “spiteful and provocative actions” as it brushed off the accusation that its warship had shone a laser at an Australian surveillance plane. But the Australian government hit back on Tuesday, confirming that the Australian plane had dropped buoys in the water to detect acoustic signals but only after the laser was detected. It said the Royal Australian Air Force had acted “within international law at all times”.  The Australian government had demanded an explanation from Beijing over a “dangerous, unprofessional and reckless” incident last Thursday in which it said a People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLA-N) warship had used a laser to illuminate an Australian P-8A Poseidon surveillance aircraft. The Australian aircraft had been tracking two PLA-N vessels that were sailing east through the Arafura Sea, north of Australia. A new statement issued by the China’s national defence ministry on Monday did not address the claim of the laser use in any detail. Instead, the statement said the PLA-N vessel “maintained safe, normative and professional operations” and accused the Australian side of spreading “false information” and making an “irresponsible claim”. The ministry also made two claims of its own, including that the Australian P-8A surveillance aircraft had “approached the airspace” over the PLA-N vessels “with the nearest distance of only 4km”. A ministry spokesperson said that was “very close”. The second claim was that the Australian aircraft had cast a sonar buoy into the water around the Chinese vessel. Such a device – also known as a sonobuoy – can be used to gather acoustic information and help detect submarines. An image released by China’s national defence ministry shows a triangular orange buoy in the water. The ministry’s spokesperson, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, accused the ADF of “spiteful and provocative actions” that would “undoubtedly result in misunderstanding and threaten the safety of aircraft, vessel and personnel of both sides”. “China is firmly opposed to these actions by the Australia,” he said. He called on Australia to “stop such provocative and risky actions” and “avoid negative effects on the relationship of the two countries and two militaries”. Australia responded quickly to the claims, with Defence issuing a new statement on Tuesday saying surveillance activities were “conducted in a disciplined and safe manner” and the use of sonobuoys was “common practice”. Such devices were used “to collect passive acoustic data on environmental activity as well as surface and sub-surface contacts” and did not pose any hazard to shipping, the Australian statement said. “No sonobuoys were used prior to the PLA-N vessel directing its laser at the P-8A aircraft on 17 February,” it said, pushing back at Beijing’s implication that the use of them could be seen as provocative. “Some sonobuoys were used after the incident but were dropped in the water a significant distance ahead of the PLA-N vessel.” The statement added: “Australia does not engage in the spread of misinformation or disinformation.” Earlier, a Defence spokesperson said that at the time of the laser incident the RAAF plane was about 7,700m from the PLA-N vessel and flying at an altitude of 457m. The spokesperson confirmed that “the closest the P-8 flew to the PLA-N vessel was approximately 3,900m” but said this was a “standard flight profile” for a visual inspection of a surface vessel. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said the Australian surveillance aircraft was “exactly where it was allowed to be, doing everything they were allowed to do and keeping eyes on those who are coming into our exclusive economic zone”. “They were doing their job as they do every single day and we make no apology for where our surveillance aircraft are looking after and protecting Australia,” Morrison told reporters on Tuesday. The prime minister said the use of the laser was “extremely disappointing” and required a full explanation from Beijing, “not for it to be dismissed or shunted off or some of the usual responses that we get”. The independent South Australian senator Rex Patrick said the laser incident was “unprovoked” and “unquestionably an aggressive act, intended to intimidate”. He called on the government to “declare China’s defence attaché in Canberra persona non grata and require him to leave Australia without delay”. “The Chinese government’s refusal to accept fault for this serious incident and their spurious claim that Australia is ‘spreading malicious disinformation’ requires an emphatic response from the Australian government to register just how unacceptable China’s behaviour has and continues to be,” Patrick said in a statement. Senior Australian diplomatic staff in Beijing have raised Thursday’s incident with China’s ministries of foreign affairs and national defence. Officials in Canberra have also raised it with the Chinese embassy. The Australian government first disclosed the laser incident in a statement issued late on Saturday by Defence, which said the “unprofessional and unsafe military conduct” could have “endangered the safety and lives of the ADF personnel”. Morrison quickly declared it to be an “act of intimidation” and the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, also characterised China’s actions as an “outrageous act of aggression” and “a reckless act”. Labor has sought a briefing from the government on the incident, which has emerged as the latest flashpoint in the increasingly strained relationship between Australia and China. Morrison has cited the incident as he ramps up pre-election rhetoric about national security.",News/Australia news,China accuses Australian defence force of ‘spiteful’ actions after laser accusation,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/china-accuses-australian-defence-force-of-spiteful-actions-over-laser-accusation
2/22/2022,"Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to enter the Russian-controlled areas of southeast Ukraine following a decision to recognise the territories as independent states. The decision to dispatch his troops to perform “peacekeeping duties” will be viewed in Ukraine and by other western allies as an occupation of the region and likely trigger tough sanctions and a Ukrainian military response.  The deployment was revealed in the text of two treaty documents that Putin signed with the leaders of the separatist republics on Tuesday. The third article of the treaties provided for the “implementation of peacekeeping functions by the armed forces of the Russian Federation” in the Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, which Ukraine and most of the world views at its sovereign territory. On Monday night Ukrainian officials said Russian troops may have already entered separatist territory. The officials said local people in the town of Makiivka, 15kms west of rebel-held Donetsk, saw what appeared to be Russian armoured vehicles on the move. One source - who declined to be named - said “a huge convoy of Russian armoured personnel carriers and other equipment has been travelling for one and a half hours”. It was spotted heading north towards the city of Yasynuvata, also in the Donestk region. Video released by Ukraine appeared to show a column of military vehicles moving in convoy along a road. The officials said it was not possible to tell if the troops belonged to the regular Russian army, or were from Russian-controlled separatist units. The two territories are run by separatist governments widely seen as Russian proxy states inside Ukraine. Since 2014, they have been in conflict with Kyiv, which refers to them as “temporarily occupied territories”, similar to Crimea. They have received military and financial backing from Moscow since they declared their existence after the Ukrainian revolution in 2014. The two regions cover an area of about 6,500 sq miles and were primarily known before the war for their heavy industry and coal mining. Donetsk, the largest city, previously had an international airport and hosted matches during the Uefa Euro 2012 championship. The fighting has destroyed the airport and left the territories mostly cut off from the rest of Ukraine in a dire economic state. The borders with Russia remain open. What are their relationship to Moscow? Officially, Moscow sees the two states as part of Ukraine and has not recognised their independence, but it has dealings with the leaderships of the self-declared states. Unofficially, the two regions are seen as fully controlled by Moscow. Who are the people there? Leaked documents suggest there are just under 3 million people remaining in the territories, 38% of whom are pensioners. That’s less than half of the pre-war population. Public opposition in the territories is virtually non-existent. It has become extremely difficult for independent journalists to go to the region. How many troops are there? It is not clear how large a force is present in the two territories. Ukraine has claimed that there are “35,000 military personnel and 481 battle tanks, 914 armoured combat vehicles, 720 artillery systems, 202 multiple launch rocket systems on the uncontrolled territories of Donbass”. According to Rochan Consulting, however, those numbers could be “overestimated”. In a televised address early on Tuesday morning, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy accused Russia of wrecking peace talks and ruled out making any territorial concessions. Zelenskiy said Ukraine was committed to peace and diplomacy and Ukraine was expecting “clear and effective” steps from its allies. “We are not afraid,” he said. The decision to send in troops was revealed hours after Putin said he would recognise the Russian-controlled territories in southeast Ukraine as independent states in a pivotal decision that would scuttle an existing peace agreement. Putin announced the decision in a televised speech marked by the Russian leader’s visceral anger at a country he has called a “brother nation”. “Those who took the path of violence, bloodshed and lawlessness did not recognise and don’t recognise any other solution to the Donbas problem besides the military,” Putin said. “Therefore I believe it is necessary to take a long overdue decision to immediately recognise the independence and sovereignty of the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic” – the Russian proxy states in east Ukraine. State television then broadcast a short video showing Putin signing a presidential order to recognise the two Russian-backed states. The separatist leaders were also present. A full-scale invasion of the country remains possible, using the estimated 190,000 troops that he has mustered near Ukraine’s borders. Minutes after Putin finished speaking, the White House announced the prohibition of US investment in or trade with in the breakaway republics and potential sanctions against anyone operating within the Moscow-backed territories. “We will also soon announce additional measures related to today’s blatant violation of Russia’s international commitments,” the White House spokesperson, Jen Psaki, said. A senior administration official said more US sanctions would be announced on Tuesday, and would be proportionate to Russian actions overnight. “We’ll be watching very closely the actual actions that Russia takes,” the official said. The UK said it will announce its own sanctions on Tuesday. Joe Biden spoke to his Ukrainian counterpart during the second half of Putin’s rambling near hour-long address, before calling the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had been trying to arrange a Biden-Putin summit. France and Germany are both signatories to the Minsk agreements, a peace deal that will probably be abandoned as a result of the Russian decision. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, condemned Putin’s declaration. “This further undermines Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, erodes efforts towards a resolution of the conflict, and violates the Minsk agreements, to which Russia is a party,” Stoltenberg said in a statement. The EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel said: “The recognition of the two separatist territories in Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law, the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the Minsk agreements. “The EU and its partners will react with unity, firmness and determination in solidarity with Ukraine.” The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Putin’s decision to recognise the two separatist Ukrainian republics was “plainly in breach of international law. It is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine.” He also described it as an “ill omen” that things were moving in the wrong direction. In his speech, Putin condemned Ukraine’s decision to move on from its Soviet past, painting the de-facto partition as his punishment. “Modern Ukraine was wholly and fully created by Bolshevik, communist Russia,” he said. “You want decommunisation? That suits us fine. But don’t stop halfway. We’re ready to show Ukraine what real decommunisation means for it.” The announcement followed an extraordinary meeting of his security council broadcast on national television, where the Russian president said he would make a decision later on Monday after a choreographed back-and-forth with his top advisers designed to create public support for the decision. “We’ve been negotiating for eight years,” Putin told his aides at one point during the security council meeting. “We’re at a dead end.” In turn, each of Putin’s top advisers stood at a lectern and delivered a speech that ended in favour of recognising the separatist states in Ukraine’s Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which have been at war with Kyiv since 2014. It ended in a made-for-TV cliffhanger. “I have heard your opinion. A decision will be made today,” Putin said. Putin has instructed his subordinates to “maintain tensions” with the west as he seeks “security guarantees” that would in effect reconstitute a Russian sphere of influence in eastern Europe. To that end, Russia has amassed up to 190,000 troops on Ukraine’s borders, threatening a massive invasion that could target Kyiv and other cities, according to western officials. The threat of official recognition for its two proxy states in Donetsk and Luhansk has also been a part of that pressure campaign. Russia has controlled and armed the two states since the outbreak of fighting in south-east Ukraine after a revolution in Kyiv in 2014 but wanted to keep them in Ukraine with the right to veto crucial decisions, such as membership of Nato. Ukraine has said it will contest any decision by Russia to recognise the territories’ independence and would recognise the move as a Russian decision to exit the Minsk agreement. After Putin’s speech, Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s foreign minister, said he had called for UN security council states to hold consultations under the Budapest memorandum to “discuss urgent actions aimed at de-escalation, as well as practical steps to guarantee the security of Ukraine”. This likely sets the stage for a meeting of the security council where Ukraine can put its case to the world. Any of the members can request an urgent meeting, which has to be held within 24 hours of the formal demand going in. Russia is the security council president and so may be able to control whether the meeting is closed or open. However, western member states that have been pushing hard for a diplomatic resolution to the crisis are likely to group together in a show of strength, one envoy said. Ukraine’s former defence minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk said any attempt by Russia to expand the territory controlled by pro-Moscow separatists would mean a full-scale war with Ukraine. The historic borders of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions are much larger than the exiting pro-Moscow-run areas. Key Ukrainian cities include the port city of Mariupol, Kramatorsk – where Ukraine’s army has its eastern HQ – and numerous villages. “Those regions are regular towns where people live regular lives. Any attempt to occupy those areas would be direct violent aggression by Russia on to Ukraine. There would be war,” Zagorodnyuk said.

2/22/2022,"The $8bn dollar takeover bid for AGL Energy is a sign the “world is waking up” to the rapid shifts in electricity generation and demand with the surprise only in its timing, Kerry Schott, the former chair of Australia’s Energy Security Board, has said. The 185-year-old energy firm on Monday rejected the unsolicited bid by Australian technology billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes and Canadian asset manager Brookfield as it “materially undervalues the company”.  The bidders say they would shut AGL’s coal-fired power plants by 2035. AGL, which plans to close its Liddell plant by April 2023, said earlier this month it would expedite the demise of its Bayswater plant to no later than 2033 and Loy Yang A by 2045. Schott, who headed the national coordinating energy group until last October, said the bidders’ plans merely aligned the timetable to the current trajectory seen as most likely by the Australian energy market operator. “The world’s waking up to the disruption that’s been going on in electricity for a while now,” Schott said. “It gets down to how fast can we get the renewables in and keep the transmission system stable as we go.” Origin Energy last week said it had no choice but to bring forward the closure of its Eraring coal-fired plant – Australia’s largest power station – by seven years to 2025. Schott said Eraring had often been running on fewer than all of its four units already, as had AGL’s Bayswater, because of their inability to compete with the near-zero fuel costs of wind and solar. Both are in New South Wales and burn black coal. “For the orderly transition, we do need to make sure we’ve got a backup of either pumped hydro or gas, frankly, and there will be the need to keep some coal … while those [new generation and storage assets] are getting built,” Schott said. “You can’t just turn everything off tomorrow – it’d be a disaster.” Commonwealth-owned Snowy Hydro was one way the federal government could support the transition, as well as the funding it was giving to aid new transmission lines to allow more renewables on to the grid, she said. It was also Labor’s “stated policy” to do even more to fund new transmission should it win this year’s elections. The states, including NSW and Victoria, were also prioritising new grid connections that would allow them to expand renewables and meet their carbon emission reduction goals, which are more ambitious than the Morrison government’s, Schott said. Analysts and some within AGL see access to the company’s 4.5 million customers across the country as a key motivation for any would-be suitor. Tim Buckley, director of Climate Energy Finance and a leading decarbonisation advocate, said Mike Cannon-Brookes’ almost $80m shareholding of Brighte Capital – which retails solar panels and battery packages to households – revealed the potential for a huge expansion of the business in Australia. Cannon-Brookes has “been involved in that for two years and learning by doing what’s involved,” Buckley said. “It’s about doing that now at 10 times the speed using the existing customer base of AGL.” A spokesperson said Brighte had notched up more than 100,000 households as customers since starting in 2015. It has retail licences in NSW, South Australia, Queensland, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory, and has applied for one in Victoria. “We’re excited about [Cannon-Brookes’] bid to take over AGL,” she said, adding it would bring forward the opportunity “to move Australia towards a clean energy future but there’s no impact on Brighte that we can share”. Buckley said Origin Energy had lately touted the success of its purchase of Octopus Energy as a rapidly growing artificial intelligence-driven energy retailer in the UK, showing the potential for similar expansion in Australia. “It’s been growing it at 50 to 100% year on year over the last five years,” he said. “It’s got 2.8 million customers in the UK, and it’s all about using the smart grid to drive lower electricity prices for consumers and to drive decarbonisation.” AGL declared on Monday that its plan to split by 30 June into a mostly generating company, Accel Energy, and a retail arm, AGL Australia, remained on track. Still, within AGL, there’s some excitement at the prospect that an entrepreneur with Cannon-Brookes’ success at creating a software firm worth many billions of dollars was making a play for their company. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning While AGL had lost as much as 80% of its share value over the past five years prior to the takeover offer, the company had started to bounce back with the stock up by half in the past 12 months. Its shares gained more than 10% during Monday’s trade. “It feels like the market has turned the corner,” said one staffer who was not authorised to speak publicly. AGL’s purchase of a majority stake in UK energy retailer OVO – a rival to Octopus – was a sign the company was already determined to expand such businesses. Whether or not the bidders lift their offer or others enter the fray, though, AGL does face some challenges, including what to do with its 3.2 million gas customers. The company has struggled to secure supplies of that fossil fuel after opposition to its coal seam gas plans in NSW and a gas import terminal in Victoria forced AGL to abandon both projects. The AGL Australia arm also has a net zero greenhouse gas emissions goal by 2040, which would be difficult to achieve if it were to continue to retail gas.",News/Business,‘World is waking up’: ex-energy boss Kerry Schott says AGL bid a sign of big changes ahead,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/22/world-is-waking-up-ex-energy-boss-kerry-schott-says-agl-bid-a-sign-of-big-changes-ahead
2/22/2022,"Neil Balnaves, the Australian arts philanthropist and former television executive, has died aged 77 after a boating accident. Leading figures from the arts industry have paid tribute to Balnaves as a man who had a vision to “create a better Australia”.  The Balnaves Foundation released a short statement on Tuesday, confirming his death. “The Balnaves family sends their heartfelt thank for people’s kind words and wishes and kindly requests privacy at this difficult time,” it said. Balnaves was reportedly holidaying with his wife, Diane, near Tahiti when the accident occurred. Balnaves had a successful career in TV, running Southern Star production house and producing popular shows, including Big Brother, Bananas in Pyjamas, Water Rats and McLeod’s Daughters. After a string of successes, he became chair of the Ardent Leisure Group – which runs theme parks such as Dreamworld on the Gold Coast – from 2003 until 2016. After a boating accident on the Gold Coast in 2002, which almost killed him, Balnaves became an avid philanthropist. He gave away $20m of his fortune to arts organisations. “As you can imagine, I had a lot of time to think throughout this period,” he told the Advertiser in 2011. “And what I came to was this: How many more houses do I need? Do I want the jet plane? Do I want another yacht? Not really. “There comes a time when those things stop meaning so much to you.” Guardian Australia was just one of the beneficiaries of his philanthropic foundation, which also donated to Sydney’s Ensemble and Belvoir Street theatres, the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Art Gallery of South Australia, the Adelaide festival and Bangarra Dance Theatre. The foundation gave a grant to Guardian Australia for in-depth reporting on Indigenous affairs, and an in-depth reporting project on Australian arts. Guardian Australia editor, Lenore Taylor, said: “When I was first exploring the idea of philanthropy as a means to speed Guardian Australia’s expansion and extend our reporting into new areas, it was often difficult to incorporate our absolute requirement for complete editorial independence with the usual way grants were structured.” “Neil and his son Hamish immediately understood and their generous grants have provided a template for further philanthropic projects, with philanthropy now an accepted model for media companies to undertake reporting above and beyond their current capacities. The Balnaves Foundation grants have funded two ongoing multiple award-winning streams of journalism, in Indigenous investigations, and culture reporting.” The Balnaves Foundation also funded Indigenous and health research. Balnaves is survived by his wife, Diane Balnaves, who he married in 1971, and his children, Hamish and Victoria. Sadly, their eldest child, Alexandra, died in 2019 following a long illness. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In a statement Mark Kilmurry, artistic di­rector of Sydney’s Ensemble Theatre, which is sponsored by the foundation, remembered Balnaves as a great friend. “Yesterday afternoon we were informed of the shocking and terribly sad news of Neil Balnaves’ fatal boating accident while on holidays,” Kilmurry said. “Neil Balnaves, through the Balnaves Foundation, was not only a major sponsor of Ensemble Theatre but he became a great friend and supporter. “Neil had a vision to create a better Australia through education, medicine and the arts, especially First Nations artists, and was never afraid to stand up for what he believed in,” Kilmurry said. Kilmurry described Balnaves as a champion for the creative community, not just with his philanthropy but his personal passion for the arts. “We will miss his generous and fearless spirit,” he said. People from Australia’s arts community paid tribute to his life on social media. “A believer in the importance and impact of the arts as an essential element of communities,” the CEO of Creative Partnerships Australia, Fiona Menzies, wrote on Twitter. “His philanthropy was generous and committed.” Journalist and arts writer Ashleigh Wilson described Balnaves as a “tireless, visionary, inspiring advocate for the arts in Australia”. “He believed in the transformational possibilities of culture and the power of storytelling. He’ll be greatly missed,” Wilson wrote.",News/Australia news,"Neil Balnaves, Australian arts philanthropist, dies aged 77 after boating accident",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/22/neil-balnaves-australian-arts-philanthropist-dies-aged-77-after-boating-accident
2/22/2022,"A “crisis of confidence in policing” can only be put right through fundamental reform or risk the end of policing by consent, the head of a review of the police service will warn on Tuesday. Sir Michael Barber, the chair of the Strategic Review of Policing in England and Wales, will say that a “Betamax police force” is unsuccessfully pursuing “blockchain-enabled criminals” as he urges modernisation of crime-fighting technology and new training for officers.  His intervention comes just weeks before the publication of the findings of his review, which is expected to make more than 50 recommendations for the future of forces in England and Wales. It also follows the resignation of the UK’s most senior police officer, Cressida Dick, as head of the Met after multiple allegations of misogyny and racism among the UK’s largest force. In front of an audience of senior figures from police forces, criminal justice bodies and government officials at the Centre for Policy Studies webinar, Barber will say: “There is a clear crisis of confidence in policing in England and Wales. This is not just the result of recent high-profile issues but is far more fundamental. “Huge societal, technological and environmental changes are happening at warp speed yet too often policing seems stuck in the past, hardly fit for the present yet alone the future.” In comments which will question police cuts under recent governments, Barber will say that the blue line is stretched “too thin” and is focused on dealing with social issues instead of fighting and preventing crime. “It is encouraging that more police are now being recruited but there is a long way to go. Too often our police are effectively a social service dealing more with mental health and family breakdown than a crime-fighting or crime-prevention service. We need more police and they need a laser focus on the crime challenges of today,” he will say. “In the digital age, where the dark web is often the new crime frontline, it can feel like a contest between a Betamax police force and blockchain enabled criminals. As an illustration, we have a National Police Computer that is nearly 50 years old and is an emblem of the past rather than a cutting-edge tool of the present.” In a nod to the recent revelations of racist, sexist and homophobic comments made by officers at Charing Cross station, he will say: “Taken together with some deep-rooted issues around professional development, training and leadership, the challenges for our police are great and growing. “In two weeks we will publish our report, which will make 54 recommendations for change, and I hope it will mark a fundamental turning point in the modernisation of a public service that matters deeply to us all. Barber, who served as the chief adviser on delivery during Tony Blair’s second term as prime minister, will be joined by policing minister Kit Malthouse and Surrey police and crime commissioner Lisa Townsend for the discussion. Malthouse is expected to say: “We know that crime is changing and that the future will present new challenges to policing. “I thank Sir Michael for his work and I look forward to looking at this report and the recommendations once released to make sure we take the right action to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow.”",News/UK news,Police review chief says ‘Betamax police’ stuck in the past ,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/21/police-review-chief-says-betamax-police-stuck-in-the-past
2/22/2022,"Days before a new legislative map for North Dakota was set to be introduced in the state house, leaders of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation sent a letter to the governor and other state lawmakers urging them to rethink the proposal. “All citizens deserve to have their voices heard and to be treated fairly and equally under the law,” they wrote, arguing that the proposed map was illegal, diluting the strength of their communities’ voice.  But instead, in early November, the Republican-controlled legislature approved the map, with only minor changes. And the Republican governor, Doug Burgum, quickly signed it. “Our voice is going to be muffled once again,” the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa chairman, Jamie Azure, told the Guardian. “It’s getting a little sickening, tell you the truth.” The nations have sued the state, alleging that the map, which was meant to account for population changes identified in the 2020 census, doesn’t comply with section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. The lawsuit, filed earlier this month, claims the map packs some Indigenous voters into one House subdistrict, while putting other “nearby Native American voters into two other districts dominated by white voters who bloc vote against Native Americans’ preferred candidates”. It adds that complying with the Voting Rights Act would mean placing the two nations in a single district, where they would “comprise an effective, geographically compact majority”. Azure said: “We never want to enter into lawsuits; we never want to do these things. But, you know, at a certain point, the goodwill just goes out the window. And, you know, we’re tired of being disrespected. And that’s how we feel with this lawsuit.” North Dakota’s secretary of state, Al Jaeger, the top election official for the state, told the Guardian in an email that they do not comment on ongoing legal cases. Indigenous people in the US have faced generations of voting restrictions. Although Indigenous people were granted citizenship in 1924, it took more than three decades before they were considered eligible to vote in every state. Since then, they have continued to face a host of roadblocks in the form of scarce polling locations, lack of access to the internet and language barriers. The National Congress of American Indians reported that they have the lowest voter turnout in the country, with 34% of Indigenous people not registered to vote. In North Dakota, the state only recently reached a settlement with two nations over a law requiring voters to have a valid identification card with a home address (many homes on reservations don’t have a street address). The state ultimately agreed to allow Indigenous people to vote without a residential address. In this new case, the legislative map divides District 9, which includes Turtle Mountain, whose members tend to favor candidates on the political left, into two subdistricts. Since they have a majority in one subdistrict, but not the other, the result is the nation has one less House seat in which to elect their candidate of choice, explained Michael Carter, staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund, one of the groups representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. It also moved the Spirit Lake Reservation to District 15, grouping it with counties farther north. Spirit Lake tribal members are also known for favoring progressive candidates, while this area tends to be more conservative, Carter explained. The result, he said, would be an Indigenous candidate of choice winning about 5% of the time. “This is just another one of those loopholes that they’re throwing around at us. But we have remedies for it. The remedy that is proposed would work for us and the state,” said the Spirit Lake Tribal chairman, Douglas Yankton, Sr, referring to the proposal to put both nations into a single district. Jean Schroedel, political science professor at Claremont Graduate University and author of Voting in Indian Country: The View from the Trenches, described the redistricting as a “violation in what has previously been the interpretations of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act”. But, she added, “the court seems to be moving very much away from that.” She cited the recent supreme court decision stating Alabama did not have to redraw its congressional map before the 2022 midterm elections despite a lower court ruling the map discriminated against Black people. North Dakota is home to five federally recognized nations, with American Indian and Alaska Native people making up about 6% of the state’s population. Some tribal members in the state do support the new map, as the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation in western North Dakota was placed in a subdistrict, as it requested. But for Yankton, who said committee members never came to the Spirit Lake or Turtle Mountain reservations during the redistricting process despite requests, the map is the latest voting rights injustice for Native people: “It’s violating our democratic right, as citizens of North Dakota, to participate and support people who choose to run for whatever offices. And it hinders us from even having a chance as Native Americans to run for offices.”",News/US news,Indigenous nations sue North Dakota over ‘sickening’ gerrymandering,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/21/native-american-tribes-sue-north-dakota-gerrymandering
2/22/2022,"Is it strange, or is it wrong, that I hadn’t thought of them in a while? Or is that, in fact, the way it should be? Should we let monsters endure in the memory or should we deny them as much space in our lives as we can? There was no sign that any such questions had been asked before or during the making of Channel 4’s new three-part documentary Moors Murders: The Witness, which dragged the heinous crimes of Ian Brady and Myra Hindley before us once again. I looked for a reason for it – the marking of some terrible anniversary, perhaps, or the beginning of a new search of Saddleworth Moor for Keith Bennett’s body, which remains the only one of the couple’s five victims not yet found. There seems to be none.  The hook on which the programme hangs is some “never before seen” letters from Brady and Hindley to Janie Jones. She had been serving a sentence for vice charges in HMP Holloway in the 1970s when Hindley was there, and potentially saved the latter’s life when she was attacked by another inmate. They stayed in touch after Jones was released. Over the years, as further evidence about Hindley’s involvement in the crimes emerged and the stories told to Jones became inconsistent, Jones started writing to Brady to try to collate facts. “My psychology was – I’d do one serial killer against the other,” says Jones, with a degree of sang-froid that begins to chill one’s own blood. It also features interview footage with David Smith (who died in 2012), Hindley’s brother-in-law and friend of Brady who witnessed the murder of Edward Evans and testified to it in court, helping to secure their convictions and life sentences. We hear the shocking story Smith told the court of Brady murdering 17-year-old Evans in front of him with an axe. Hindley had, it appears, deliberately brought Smith over to witness the killing so that Brady could have a hold over him. What they didn’t expect – a small but telling indication of their distance from normal morality – was that he would go home, tell his wife (Hindley’s sister, Maureen) what had happened and the next morning, when people were around and he felt safe, call the police and tell them everything. This basic tale, bleak in summary and bleaker in the telling of it, is padded out by interviews with Jones, readings from the letters and analysis by a psychologist and a criminologist that is so trite and unilluminating you wonder how far down the list of potential contributors the producers had to go to find someone willing to give their two penn’orth and whether this should not, at some point, have given them pause for thought about the value of the programme they were putting together. Because really, there is none. The letters only reinforce what we already know about the killers – that Brady (diagnosed as a psychopath in 1985 and an inhabitant of high-security Ashworth hospital until he died) was a mass of grandiose delusions, cruelties, manipulations and narcissism. Hindley refused to take any responsibility for her part in the murders no matter who she was talking to or how much she claimed to trust them, blaming Brady and his hold over her until the end. Smith was saying what he has already said, with purpose, in court half a century ago. It was as if somebody at Channel 4 had simply decided that enough time had passed to make it OK for us all to hear about it again. There is an argument that says silence can be complicity. If we don’t keep the knowledge of what terrible things people can do alive in collective and cultural memory, we risk allowing them to happen again. The counter-argument is that there comes a point when we have learned all we can from individual horrors such as Brady and Hindley, the foul but extraordinary outliers. And that by concentrating our attention on these singular and singularly extreme monsters, we allow ourselves to ignore greater but less spectacular, obvious horrors – rampant child abuse in the home, perhaps, endemic violence against women by “ordinary” men, or a police force so corrupted by misogyny and racism that it is barely fit for purpose, to name but the first few that immediately occur to me. To my mind, we have long stripped the Moors murders of anything valuable they can teach us. And that was never too much – you can safely say there has always been a consensus against child murder. Varying public attitudes towards male and female murderers are a known phenomenon and we move to arm ourselves against its unjust effects. To rake these murders up again at this point in history requires a strong justification to defend against charges of simple salaciousness, titillation or ratings-chasing. Perhaps this will emerge in the remaining two episodes. I hope so.",Arts/Television & radio,Moors Murders: The Witness review – these heinous crimes have nothing more to teach us,https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/feb/21/moors-murders-the-witness-review-these-heinous-crimes-have-nothing-more-to-teach-us
2/22/2022,"Vladimir Putin’s declaration that Russia will recognise the independence of the breakaway regions of eastern Europe and his order for Russian troops to cross into those regions was greeted with dismay and new sanctions from the US and Europe. There was also alarm at Putin’s warnings of further action against Ukraine as a whole, questioning the country’s legitimacy and suggesting it presented a direct threat to Russia. Many diplomats saw the wide-ranging nature of the speech as a threat of an all-out invasion.  In Washington, the White House announced the prohibition of US investment in or trade with the breakaway republics and potential sanctions against anyone operating within the Moscow-backed territories. “We will also soon announce additional measures related to today’s blatant violation of Russia’s international commitments,” the White House spokesperson, Jen Psaki, said. On Monday night, US secretary of state Antony Blinken confirmed that the few remaining state department staff had been pulled out of Ukraine and relocated to Poland for the night, for “security reasons”. US embassy staff had previously been moved from Kyiv to Liviv. A senior US administration official said more sanctions would imposed on Tuesday and would be proportionate to Russian steps overnight. It was unclear however if the deployment of “peacekeeping forces” in the Moscow-backed enclaves would be seen by Washington as an invasion. The official pointed out that Russian forces had been acting covertly in the area for eight years. Boris Johnson spoke to the Ukrainian president on Monday night. According to Downing Street, Johnson said the steps taken by Putin made the Minsk peace process begun in 2014 “unworkable”. Johnson told Volodymyr Zelenskiy that he would “explore sending further defensive support to Ukraine” at the request of the country’s government. The prime minister will chair a Cobra meeting on Tuesday morning to discuss the latest developments, as he warned a Russian invasion could happen “in the coming hours and days”. A No 10 spokesperson said a “significant package of sanctions to be introduced immediately” will be discussed. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said British sanctions would come on Tuesday “in response to their breach of international law and attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”. The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said the recognition of the self-styled republics was “a violation of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine and inconsistent with the principles of the charter of the UN”. Ukraine has sent a letter to the Russian mission to the UN, which currently holds the chair of the security council, demanding an emergency council meeting. The call was supported by France, the UK, the US, Norway, Ireland, Albania, Mexico and Brazil. The council chair cannot stop a meeting taking place, and must hold it within 24 hours of a member state requesting it. Joe Biden spoke to Zelenskiy during the second half of Putin’s rambling near hour-long address, before calling the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had been trying to arrange a Biden-Putin summit. France and Germany are both signatories of the Minsk agreements, a peace deal that will probably be abandoned as a result of the Russian decision. In a statement from the Elysée palace, Macron said Putin’s move was a breach of international law that had to be met with European sanctions. France would call “proportionate, targeted sanctions” in Brussels, a official said. The official described Putin’s speech as “rigid and paranoid”, and that it confirmed Macron’s analysis after meeting Putin at the Kremlin earlier this month that Putin was “not the same” as he had been at their last meeting in December 2019 in Paris. After the recent meeting, Macron called Putin “more rigid, and more isolated” than before, and described a kind of “ideological, security drift”. Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, the presidents of the European Commission and European Council, said: “The recognition of the two separatist territories in Ukraine is a blatant violation of international law, the territorial integrity of Ukraine and the Minsk agreements.” “The Union will react with sanctions against those involved in this illegal act,” they said. Alar Karis, the president of Estonia, said: “Estonia will never accept the illegal decision by Russia to recognise Donetsk and Luhansk regions. They are an internationally recognised part of Ukraine, like Crimea. “Clearly, Moscow is not serious about diplomacy but is looking for casus belli.” The Latvian prime minister, Arturs Krišjānis Kariņš, said: “In a gross violation of international law, under a fabricated pretext, and by spreading false information, Russia seeks to induce a change in Ukraine’s political leadership and foreign policy course by violent means.” It appeared likely that Putin’s declaration would mean the cancellation of a potential summit between Biden and Putin. The Kremlin had earlier played down the prospect of the summit as “premature”, while the US made clear it would not take place if Russia invaded. At the end of a meeting of EU foreign ministers, the bloc’s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, said a package of prepared EU sanctions would be triggered by Russia’s recognition of the Donetsk and Luhansk territories, but the extent of the sanctions would reflect “the level of aggression”. The EU has threatened “severe costs and massive consequences” in the event of a further Russian incursion into Ukraine. The package has yet to be made public but it would involve a block on exports of key electrical components on which Russia is reliant, potentially an import ban on Russian oil and gas, and the freezing of assets of individuals and companies affiliated with the government in Moscow. The UN announced it was relocating non-essential staff and the families of UN officials posted in Ukraine, while bringing in other staff to support UN operations.",News/World news,Dismay and condemnation as west begins to impose sanctions on Russia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/putin-eastern-europe-donetsk-luhansk-reaction
2/22/2022,"You couldn’t make it up. “Now was the time for personal responsibility,” said the prime minister with no sense of personal responsibility. His whole life has been conducted with a reckless disregard for other people. Boris Johnson is a man who has always done exactly what he wants, when he wants to do it, and has a trail of broken marriages and promises to prove it. When the rest of us mugs were doing our best to follow the letter of the rules that he made, he was busy enjoying himself at one party after another. And when he was caught, he didn’t have the decency to apologise. Instead he chose to brazen it out, cheapening himself and his party still further. No matter. Do as I say, not as I do and all that. In any case, the changes to the Covid rules that the Suspect was announcing in his Commons statement had little to do with what was scientifically proven. Rather, it was to win over the libertarian rightwingers in the Tory party who had always been against any form of lockdown restrictions and on whom he was relying to support him through his ongoing Partygate difficulties.  So here was how Covid was going to work from now on. Basically, we would be acting as if it was over. After all, it certainly was for the 175,000 people who had died from the virus over the last two years, and it was time for the rest of us to get with the programme. And if anyone was unlucky enough to get Covid, then they should just knuckle down and do the right thing. Whatever that was. Johnson tugged at the toddler haircut. We were in a world of moral relativism. It might be fine for some to carry on as normal. That would be people who couldn’t afford tests and who would no longer have access to statutory sick pay from day one. They could work and infect vulnerable people. For others – that would be the better-off – not so much. It turns out you can put a price on personal responsibility. Still, Omicron hadn’t turned out to be as bad as all that, so it was time to end compulsory self-isolation, get rid of expensive test and trace programmes and see what happens. And if some of the elderly, vulnerable and unvaccinated died, then they died. They probably had it coming to them, and in any case they could all die happy knowing that life for the rest of the country would be free from health restrictions. There was one small caveat. Covid might not actually be over after all. It may return as a deadlier variant, in which case the decision to end all free testing could prove to be a huge advantage. Apparently. The Suspect hadn’t quite thought this one through. So he ad-libbed. We’d just be relying on the ONS survey to detect future Covid strains – even though there would be far fewer tests to detect them. There again, on the plus side, the fewer tests that were done, the fewer infections would be registered. Put this way, you could eliminate Covid completely by just stopping all testing. Why hadn’t he thought of that before? Understandably, Keir Starmer was less than impressed. While not against the idea of loosening restrictions in principle, he just wasn’t sure they didn’t have more to do with party management than the nation’s health. After all, they seemed to have been cobbled together at the last moment. So much so that the chancellor and the health secretary had been having a standup row over the cost of some of the changes that very morning. And judging by the frown on Sajid Javid’s face, the health secretary still wasn’t happy at having come off second best. The Suspect merely laughed this off and went out of his way to deliberately misinterpret what had been said. Either that, or he’s dimmer than we thought. The Labour leader had grabbed the stick by the wrong end yet again, he said. Except he really hadn’t. Only Johnson didn’t care. No more than he did when other opposition MPs asked why it was that the World Health Organization and the British Medical Association weren’t backing the changes. Or that there were no safeguards to protect the clinically vulnerable from being infected by their carers. Or countless other serious objections to plans that had been made on the hoof. Just rely on personal responsibility. Said the man without any. Because this was all about him feeling the love from his own backbenchers. A national health policy designed only to please 250 or so Tory MPs. And in that respect, it appeared to be wholly successful. Because not a single one found fault with a word he had said. The intellectually challenged Graham Brady sought guarantees that there would be no more lockdowns. The equally intelligent Edward Leigh merely asked for a guarantee of no more lockdowns for 10 years – the length of time he expected the Suspect to remain prime minister. Really. John Redwood wondered if the same ingenuity that Johnson had used on the pandemic could be applied to the cost-of-living crisis. That would be billions of pounds of state aid and several tax rises. So much for the free-marketeers. But the prize for maximum stupidity and toadying went to Matt Hancock. He declared it was entirely down to Johnson’s self-restraint and personal responsibility that the UK was now the first country to have seen the back of the pandemic. To think he was health secretary once. How badly must he want to be loved by Boris. The Suspect was rather more guarded in his later press conference – apart from insisting that the country should be proud in ending restrictions; as proud as he had been to break them, presumably – but then this time he was flanked by Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance. Both men seemed to think that Covid was far from over and that the measures that had been lifted could easily be reinstated with just a couple of weeks’ notice if a subsequent variant – and there would be variants, they were certain of that – proved to be more infectious and vaccine-unfriendly. As for self-isolating, it wasn’t a matter of personal responsibility, it was a national necessity, Johnson just stood there and sucked it up. He’d done what he set out to achieve in getting Tory MPs back on his side, and that was all that mattered. If he broke his promises and had to impose a further lockdown in nine months’ time because he’d screwed things up, then what the hell? He’d deal with that as and when. For now, as so often, he was just fighting for his life in the here and now. And under those circumstances, anything goes. Especially when you’ve no sense of personal responsibility.

2/22/2022,"Novak Djokovic returned to competition for the first time since his deportation from Australia last month. He played at a high level as he defeated the wildcard Lorenzo Musetti 6-3, 6-3 and reached the second round of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Monday. Eight weeks into the new tennis season, Djokovic’s victory marked his first match of the year and he was content with how he navigated the situation.  “All in all, it’s a straight-sets win so of course I have to be satisfied with my tennis,” Djokovic said. “Especially after not playing for almost three months. Of course there were moments when I played great, there were moments when I made a couple of unforced errors in a row, uncharacteristically, but it’s normal.” With the next tournaments on Djokovic’s calendar uncertain because he is unvaccinated, the crowd in Dubai made the most of the first sighting of the world No 1. Djokovic, who has won this title five times, entered the court to a loud ovation from an audience awash with Serbian flags, frequent chants of “Nole, Nole” and one spectator even carrying a flag with the hashtag “#WeStandWithNovakDjokovic” written across it. Although he continued to undertake daily fitness sessions upon his return from Australia, Djokovic did not train for 10 days as he dealt with his emotions from the events in Melbourne, only picking up a racket two and a half weeks ago. Despite some rustiness, Djokovic played a solid match, dictating his young Italian opponent from inside the baseline, serving well in the few tense moments and flipping spectacularly from defence to attack a number of times as a reminder of his supreme talent. This week marks one of the most significant moments of the year for Djokovic. After being unable to defend his Australian Open title, his No 1 ranking is seriously threatened by Daniil Medvedev. Should Medvedev, who is playing the Mexican Open in Acapulco, either equal or outperform Djokovic’s result this week the Russian will overtake him on Monday. For now, Djokovic was far more concerned with the simple sensation of victory. After his win, he saluted his audience, even addressing them in Serbian. “I couldn’t ask for a better reception ... it’s been a while since I played the last match so I couldn’t pick a better place to kick-start the season.” In the match before Djokovic’s, Andy Murray defeated the qualifier Christopher O’Connell 6-7(4), 6-3, 7-5 in a gruelling 2hr 51min contest to reach the second round in Dubai. It was an essential win after Murray endured one of the most one-sided defeats of his career last week in Doha, 6-0, 6-1 against Roberto Bautista Agut. Now firmly back inside the top 100, he will play for his 700th career win in the second round. Afterwards, Murray said he had not seen Djokovic yet in Dubai but they had spoken during his time in Australia. “We shared a few messages whilst he was in Australia,” he said. “Like I said at the time, I don’t agree with his decision. I think it would be a lot easier for him obviously if he was to get vaccinated. But I also didn’t like seeing him in the situation that he was in Australia as someone that I respect, have known since I was a child. I didn’t like seeing that.” Meanwhile, Cameron Norrie crossed 3,000 ranking points for the first time and returned to his career‑high ranking of No 12 after the British No 1 won his third career ATP title in Delray Beach late on Sunday night.",Sport/Sport,Novak Djokovic returns to action with solid win over Lorenzo Musetti in Dubai,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/21/novak-djokovic-returns-win-dubai-andy-murray
2/22/2022,"The video shows a ghostly scene. A night-time battle is taking place in a forest. There are flashes and mysterious bangs. An unidentified figure cries out in pain. The wounded man is wearing a helmet. Otherwise there are few clues as to where the footage was shot, or what exactly is going on. A TV report by Russia’s state-run channel one gave the answer. The man seen in eerie silhouette was a Ukrainian saboteur, it said. He was part of a diversionary team sent across enemy lines into pro-Russian separatist territory. His mission? To blow up a local chlorine plant in the rebel-held town of Horlivka, the channel said.  During the firefight two infiltrators were killed, it added. By happy coincidence, representatives of the Donetsk People’s Republic – one of two pro-Moscow entities in the east of Ukraine – retrieved the video from the wounded man’s head camera. He had chucked it away, channel one told its viewers. Anatomy of a Russian Seperatist False Flag - On February 18th the Telegram channel of the press service of the People's Militia of the Donetsk People's Republic published the following video, claiming to show a sabotage operation targeting chlorine tankshttps://t.co/Syk8NG2zKx pic.twitter.com/R4mfggxbPg There was only one problem with the Kremlin’s dramatic account of the incident. It was entirely fake. The soundtrack of shooting and explosions was actually more than a decade old. It had been recorded in April 2010, according to open source researchers, during a Finnish military exercise. Ukraine’s intelligence service believes the video is the work of the GRU, Russia’s military spy agency, which has worked actively in Ukraine since the 2014 annexation of Crimea and the shooting down of the MH17 passenger plane. The film’s creators appear to have lifted the original Finnish video from the internet. They spliced its sound track on to new video content made two weeks ago – editing out a few excited “ooohs” from Finnish recruits. “Russia has a long record of doing this. It isn’t surprising,” Elliot Higgins, founder of the investigative website Bellingcat told the Guardian. He added: “What’s surprising is they haven’t got any better at doing it. In some ways they have got worse. It’s really dumb and lazy.” Higgins said international audiences were mostly impervious to Kremlin disinformation. But he said domestic Russian viewers tended to believe fake TV footage, which was “theatrically” created for state propaganda purposes. This was especially true of the older generation, he said. Over the past week Russia has churned out numerous false stories from what Ukraine’s foreign ministry Dmytro Kuleba called a “fake producing factory”. They include claims Ukraine is planning to attack separatist enclaves, and that it on Monday smuggled armoured vehicles and saboteurs across the border – supposedly recorded by helmet cam. The Kremlin’s media goal is to create a pretext for invasion, Higgins suggested. As part of this strategy Russian TV has begun actively promoting information which suggests a vast humanitarian crisis is unfolding in eastern Ukraine. It has claimed residents have come under heavy Ukrainian shelling – something Kyiv says is not true. The information has ranged from reports on increased bombardment to more outlandish “provocations,” such as attempted car bombing on Friday outside the separatist administration building in Donetsk. The same day the territory’s pro-Moscow leader, Denis Pushilin, released a video saying the situation had become so grave civilians had to be bussed out to safety and Russia. Pushilin’s evacuation order was released on 18 February. Bellingcat, however, discovered from the video’s meta-data on the channel Telegram that it had actually been filmed two days earlier – last Wednesday. “It’s incompetence,” Higgins said. At the time the situation across the line of control between the Ukrainian military and separatists positions was calm. A large part of Russian efforts to lay the groundwork for a Kosovo-style intervention in east Ukraine is to claim that the Ukrainian efforts to regain control of the territories in 2014 amounted to “genocide”. Putin has used the word on several occasions. He has also made comparisons to the massacre at Srebrenica in Bosnia. “What is happening in the Donbas today is genocide,” Putin said last week. Russian diplomats circulated a document at the United Nations claiming Ukraine is engaged in “exterminating the civilian population” in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Late on Sunday night Russia’s embassy in Washington sent a similar document to US journalists. The “genocide” theme was also repeatedly mentioned during Putin’s extraordinary security council meeting on Monday in Moscow. It has featured extensively in state media bulletins, leading up to the request by the separatist authorities for military and economic help from the Kremlin, as well as legal recognition, granted by Putin on Monday evening. In 2014, during the peak of the conflict, numerous mass burials were carried out, particularly in Luhansk, where the bodies of many of those who died in the war could not be buried immediately due to the intense fighting. During a visit to Luhansk in September 2014, the Guardian saw stacks of simple wooden coffins at the morgue, which were later buried in hastily dug mass graves. However, to describe the deaths in Luhansk and other parts of the current separatist areas as “genocide” is grossly misleading. Both sides used artillery on civilian areas during the gruesome battles of 2014, but there was never any mass programme to execute civilians based on ethnicity, language or political preference. Starting last summer, separatist authorities began exhuming bodies from graves, to perform DNA analysis and identify the remains of people they said had been “victims of Ukrainian aggression”. At the time, the move caused alarm among some of those monitoring the region, with a sense that the exhumations might be later used politically. Now, that seems to be happening. Meanwhile, top Russian propagandists have openly accused western leaders of warmongering. In a recent segment, Dmitry Kiselyov, who runs a primetime weekly news show, asked “who needs war?” The answer was a list of foreign leaders and dignitaries: Boris Johnson, Prince Andrew, Joe Biden, Recep Erdoğan, Emmanuel Macron and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s embattled pro-western president. For some pro-Kremlin opinion-makers, the turn toward war has been marked by a quick change in message. Margarita Simonyan, the head of RT, spent weeks mocking US and European officials for their warnings that Russia was preparing for war. But early last week, she changed her opinion: “Russia cannot but stop this war. What are we waiting for?” she asked. The video editing technology may be new, but the message is an old one. Finnish media pointed out that the Soviet Union in November 1939 used a similar excuse to start the winter war against Finland. The day before the Soviet invasion Moscow claimed that Finnish troops had launched “an attack”.",News/World news,‘Dumb and lazy’: the flawed films of Ukrainian ‘attacks’ made by Russia’s ‘fake factory’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/dumb-and-lazy-the-flawed-films-of-ukrainian-attacks-made-by-russias-fake-factory

2/22/2022,"The Treasury has announced plans to unlock more than £10bn of UK infrastructure investment through a post-Brexit overhaul of the insurance industry. Announcing a shake-up for the City of London after leaving the EU, the economic secretary to the Treasury, John Glen, said that a comprehensive package of reforms for the insurance sector would help enable UK-based firms to invest more in infrastructure projects.  Speaking at the Association of British Insurers annual dinner on Monday, he said EU-focused rules known as Solvency II would be replaced by a new UK regime that would give insurance firms more flexibility to invest capital in long-term growth projects. “EU regulation doesn’t work for us any more and the government is determined to fix that by tailoring the prudential regulation of insurers to our unique circumstances,” he said. “We have a genuine opportunity to maintain and grow an innovative and vibrant insurance sector while protecting policyholders and making it easier for insurance firms to use long-term capital to unlock growth.” The move comes as the government pushes to demonstrate there are benefits from Brexit for the British economy, despite official figures showing a dramatic drop in UK trade and ongoing criticism from business leaders over the higher costs and reams of red tape unleashed by leaving the EU. The UK’s insurance sector has been subject to the Solvency II rules since they were introduced in 2016 to harmonise regulation across the EU and promote the stability of firms after the 2008 financial crisis. Jacob Rees-Mogg, appointed as the Brexit opportunities minister earlier this month, has called for a rewriting of EU financial rules to meet the prime minister’s ambition of an “investment big bang” in Britain powered by the City of London. However, the plan for a post-Brexit regulatory overhaul is similar to changes already being pursued by Brussels to unlock €90bn (£75bn) in European insurance assets, in a process that would also have applied in the UK had it remained a member state. Under the changes being considered in the UK, the Treasury said there would be changes to enable insurers to invest in long-term assets such as infrastructure and to reduce current regulatory reporting requirements. Glen said that the reforms would still provide safeguards for policyholders from any failures in the insurance sector. “The reforms are expected to create an opportunity worth in the region of tens of billions of pounds for insurance firms to invest in long-term capital to unlock growth,” it said.",News/Business,Treasury plans post-Brexit overhaul of insurance industry,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/21/treasury-plans-post-brexit-overhaul-of-insurance-industry
2/22/2022,"Sitting alone at a desk in a grand, columned Kremlin room, Vladimir Putin looked across an expanse of parquet floor at his security council and asked if anyone wished to express an alternative opinion. He was met with silence.  A few hours later, the Russian president appeared on state television to give an angry, rambling lecture about Ukraine, a country that in Putin’s telling had become “a colony with a puppet regime”, and had no historical right to exist. Putin’s double bill, which was immediately followed by the signing of an agreement on Russian recognition of the two proxy states in east Ukraine as independent entities, is likely to go down in history as one of the major turning points in his 22-years-and-counting rule over Russia. This was not a politician convening his team for discussions, this was a supreme leader marshalling his minions and ensuring collective responsibility for a decision that, at minimum, will change the security architecture in Europe, and may well lead to a horrific war that consumes Ukraine. Putin appeared genuinely angry and passionate in his speech, which he almost certainly wrote himself. In a symbolic sign of his increasing isolation, with no equals who can talk back to him or debate ideas, Putin has recently taken to meeting politicians, including his own ministers, across ostentatiously large tables, apparently as a Covid precaution. But at the security council meeting on Monday, when a long table for once would have seemed appropriate, Putin sat alone, surveying his subordinates from absurdly far away, as they squirmed awkwardly in chairs waiting their turn to be grilled by the boss. From behind his desk, frequently smirking, Putin listened one-by-one to his security council. The body contains some of the few people who have Putin’s ear, but even some of them appeared overawed by the situation and nervous at fluffing their lines. Sergei Naryshkin, the hawkish head of Russia’s spy service, known for making aggressively anti-western statements, stuttered uncomfortably as Putin grilled him on whether he supported the decision. “Speak directly!” Putin snapped, twice. Eventually, when he was able to get the words out, Naryshkin said he supported “the LNR and DNR becoming part of Russia.” Putin told him that wasn’t the subject of the discussion; it was only recognition being weighed up. Some suggested this might have been a carefully scripted encounter to show the West what other options might be available, but Naryshkin’s genuinely flustered expression suggested otherwise. It is hard to tell whether or not Putin had decided his plan for Ukraine months ago, or whether he has been making plans on the hop, but it was certainly clear that the decision on recognition had been taken well before this strange, stage-managed event. There was very little exchange of opinion, and the idea that it was all spontaneous was further undermined by the fact that closeups of the watches of certain participants appeared to suggest that the “live” broadcast had in fact been filmed several hours earlier. This did not stop Putin specifically emphasising that the event really was a frank exchange of views. “Every one of you knows, and I specially want to underline it … I did not discuss any of this with you before. I did not ask your opinion before. And this is happening spontaneously, because I wanted to hear your opinions without any preliminary preparation,” he said. The appearance of Putin just a few hours later with his long, pre-prepared and wide-ranging speech made the claim this was all a real-time decision-making process even more implausible. Many of Putin’s team give the impression of genuinely believing the propaganda narrative Russia has built to justify its continuing aggression against Ukraine. Valentina Matviyenko, the only woman on the security council, gave an elongated harangue cobbled together from the more outlandish talking points of Russian news bulletins: innocent Russia facing down the nefarious west, which was backing the “genocidal” Kyiv regime. Not everyone was so enthusiastic: the prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, spoke briefly and drily, looking visibly uncomfortable. Not willing to let him off the hook without swearing fealty to the decision that was already inevitably on the way, Putin asked him directly whether he supported it; Mishustin mumbled that he did. Everyone was now publicly on record as supporting this move; nobody will be able to weasel out of it later and claim they put up a fight. The recognition decision answers some questions but others remain. There is a chance Putin may simply recognise the two republics “as they are”. This, after months of apocalyptic scenarios, would probably be privately accepted as a good outcome by Ukraine and the west. But it seems likely that Putin has much more in mind than simply taking a nibble out of Ukraine’s east and taking formal responsibility for territories he already de facto controlled. Putin’s final words, that if Kyiv did not stop the violence they would bear responsibility for the “ensuing bloodshed”, were ominous in the extreme. It sounded, quite simply, like a declaration of war.",News/World news,"Putin’s absurd, angry spectacle will be a turning point in his long reign",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/putin-angry-spectacle-amounts-to-declaration-war-ukraine
2/22/2022,"After a bruising two years in which the UK failed to prove its resilience to a pandemic, the government hopes to re-cast the nation as a scientific superpower: a country that has built on the lessons of the crisis to deliver better research, more precision healthcare, and a more streamlined pathway to new drugs and vaccines. But the government’s decision to substantially cut back on free Covid testing, as part of Boris Johnson’s “living with Covid” strategy, already threatens to undermine pioneering trials and coronavirus surveillance that are the envy of other nations. Together, they are crucial for understanding how drugs keep patients out of hospital, how immunity is holding up in vulnerable care homes and hospitals and how the epidemic is unfolding around us.  The Oxford University-backed Panoramic trial is one of the largest and most important clinical studies under way in the UK. More than 10,000 people have signed up to help researchers work out who will benefit most from Covid antivirals. While clinical trials showed that drugs such as molnupiravir can substantially reduce hospitalisations among vulnerable patients, most participants in the trials were unvaccinated. Panoramic aims to help researchers get a grip on how antivirals work in the UK population – where most people are vaccinated but many remain vulnerable because of old age or underlying health conditions. The results should underpin what doctors expect to become a central pillar of Covid care – providing antivirals to vulnerable people within days of symptoms coming on. Currently, 1.3 million people in the UK have been identified as eligible for antivirals, but the number may grow as the Panoramic results come in. That is if the trial goes ahead as planned. Health officials believe Panoramic needs free lateral flow tests for the over-50s and vulnerable adults under 50 until at least September, but free tests will end on 1 April with a possible exception for those aged 80 and over and people with compromised immune systems. If the trial needs more tests, the funding will have to be culled from other budgets. Another important project being put at risk is UCL’s Vivaldi trial. During the pandemic, Vivaldi has provided vital information on levels of infection and immunity among care home staff and residents, the latter among the most vulnerable in the country. The study links to lateral flow and PCR test results in the national testing programme to measure vaccine effectiveness and reinfection rates in residents and staff. With free testing dramatically scaled back, much of the intelligence that informs decisions on the need to re-vaccinate staff and residents, especially when new variants arise, will be lost. Similar concerns surround the UK Health Security Agency’s Siren study which draws on Covid test results to assess how swiftly tens of thousands of healthcare workers are reinfected with Covid as the epidemic unfolds – and so shed light on how quickly immunity is waning among frontline hospital staff. Amid concerns that it might be scrapped entirely, the Office for National Statistics Covid infection survey has seemingly been spared, but to what extent is unclear. The survey provides the most reliable weekly picture of the UK’s Covid epidemic. As free community tests are ended, the survey will become even more valuable, but it is also due to be scaled back, raising questions about how clear a picture health officials will have of the UK situation in the months ahead. The loss of most free testing in the community and the expected scaling back of the ONS survey could both have an impact on one area where the UK is truly world class. Swabs from both feed into the nation’s impressive genomic surveillance effort which has served as an early warning for new variants not only for the UK but for the world. The surveillance is only as good as the testing it taps into though. Without free tests, the next warning may not come so fast.",News/World news,Covid cost-cutting will put blinkers on our best Covid research ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/covid-cost-cutting-will-put-blinkers-on-our-best-covid-research
2/22/2022,"Frontline health workers in Solomon Islands have warned that its health system is on the brink of collapse as the country struggles to deal with a devastating outbreak of Covid-19. A senior doctor and two nurses at the National Referral Hospital (NRH) in the capital of Honiara have told of how there are no beds for Covid patients – leading to people dying on the floor of the wards – as well as a lack of facilities and staff shortages that have led to Covid-positive nurses being recalled to work and probationary nurses tending to critically ill patients solo, when they should be supervised by a more senior nurse.  “People are dying on the floor, the hospital is overcrowded … Sick people and dead bodies were all over,” a senior doctor at NRH said. “The morgue is full. It’s a sad experience. I have never seen this before.” Solomon Islands, a country of about 700,000 people in the South Pacific, had remained Covid-free throughout the pandemic, without a single case of the virus in 2020 and 2021. However, since Covid arrived in the country in mid-January, the country has recorded nearly 6,000 cases and around 70 deaths. The doctor, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the true number of deaths was likely to be much higher. “We have witnessed that there are deaths at home, not brought to hospital because of the fear that any dead body that comes to the hospital will be swabbed and once tested positive will not be allowed to be taken out by the relatives,” he said. “So some deaths are kept at home and it’s a sad and terrible thing to happen.” The doctor warned that healthcare facilities were struggling to cope, with the 56-bed Central field hospital fully occupied. He said that while tents had been prepared outside the hospital for the treatment of Covid-19 patients, they had no toilets, shower rooms or air-conditioning, which he alleged showed the government’s lack of preparation. “I would say that the government has failed this nation.” NRH has turned its orthopaedic ward into a “red zone” Covid ward, where critically ill patients needing oxygen are treated. But both he and a nurse in the hospital confirmed there were Covid patients across other wards in the hospitals. Staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of cases, the doctor said. “We do not have enough nurses to look after the Covid-19 patients, meaning there’s no proper observations and monitoring will take place on sick patients.” A registered nurse, who wished to remain anonymous, said staff were so overstretched that Covid-positive nurses were being called in to work. “In the past weeks, we have had no option but to recall those tested positive yet asymptomatic to come back to work as we can’t handle the increasing Covid-19 cases daily.” A newly-graduated probationary nurse who is working at NRH said junior nurses, who are meant to be supervised, were looking after critically ill patients by themselves. “We were newly graduated … we badly need supervision at all times. And this is a risky undertaking, especially when manpower is overstretched, which means we have to handle the cases ourselves.” The doctor warned that patients suffering from other illnesses and conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and those requiring surgery were not getting treatment, monitoring or medication, potentially leading to more deaths. “There are lots of people with illnesses that did not follow up because of their fear of Covid-19,” the doctor said. “They are simply afraid of coming to the hospital … This results in some dying at home; some presented at the emergency and died.” Last week, the government issued a statement saying the rapid spread of Covid was beyond the testing capability of health authorities, contributing to under-reporting of actual case numbers since the outbreak began. The health minister, Dr Culwick Togamana, warned last week that the health system could not cater for all the people who tested positive or were showing symptoms of Covid. “That is why we have advised those with mild symptoms to strictly isolate at home and only moderate to severe cases [be] brought to health facilities for clinical management,” he said. At the end of 2021, Solomon Islands had a very low vaccination rate, with about 20% of adults fully vaccinated. Since the outbreak, vaccination sites that remained empty all of last year are now experiencing massive turnout from the public, and the health minister said there had been allegations of medical practitioners selling vaccines to people. The ministry of health did not respond to questions.",News/World news,‘People are dying on the floor’: healthcare workers tell of Covid devastation in Solomon Islands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/22/people-are-dying-on-the-floor-healthcare-workers-tell-of-covid-devastation-in-solomon-islands
2/22/2022,"Jennifer Gonzales fears that Boris Johnson’s decision to lift all remaining Covid restrictions will end in “disaster”. The 56-old-year home educator says: “Covid is still here so we should carry on self-isolating if we get it. It is too soon to be changing that now.” Her view is typical of much of the nervousness in Horsham on Monday afternoon as the prime minister set out plans to lift restrictions. The West Sussex market town has the highest rate of Covid in England at 930 cases per 100,000 people.  Speaking in Horsham’s Swan Walk shopping mall, Gonzales says she is also worried about the end of free testing. “Even with free testing, a lot of people haven’t been using it and if you have to pay for it even fewer will. We will be mingling with people with no restrictions who may not know they’ve got it. I think that will be a disaster.” Lindsey, a 37-year-old care worker who did not want to give her surname, agrees. Sheltering at a bus stop from the tail end of Storm Franklin, she says: “I know they say that we should live with it. But we can still help prevent it, so self-isolation and free testing should continue.” She adds: “I know from my experience of working with vulnerable people that if you’ve got Covid you shouldn’t go into work.” She is also suspicious of Johnson’s motives for lifting restrictions now. She says: “Everything that happened with the wine and cheese parties and barbecues was ridiculous. When the government tell us one thing you should follow that. So I think he could be trying to get the public back on his side again.” Hetty Constable, 27, a hairdresser, also thinks Johnson’s plan is politically motivated. “He’s trying to get votes, but he’s a muppet and no one trusts him.” She adds: “I think you should still be made to stay at home if you have Covid. If I had it I wouldn’t come in to work. We’ve got to keep people safe.” Even some of those who back Johnson in this safe Conservative seat are uneasy about the plan. “It’s being done too quick,” says Darren Avey, a 56-year-old Tory voter who works at Horsham’s Horace Fuller lawn mower shop. He adds: “I’ve got a bad lung problem. My doctor said if you catch it you’d be gone because your lungs are so rotten and you won’t be able to fight it.” He reckons the move is financially motivated. “They’re doing it now because they can’t afford to keep the testing going. But they’ve got to keep people safe. Too many people are vulnerable.” But many in Horsham will be pleased to see the back of the restrictions, including David Tiller, 78, who spent five nights in hospital with Covid in September 2020. He says: “To me it was like flu. I ended up in hospital because I went down with pneumonia. Everybody seems to be panicking about it. It used to be that if you wore a mask when you went into a bank you’d be arrested; now you’ll be arrested if you don’t wear a mask.” David’s wife, Carol, 61, who works in Horsham Waitrose, says: “We can’t carry on with these restrictions, and people aren’t taking much notice of them anyway. I think it’s time people take their own responsibility and look after themselves, and not be told what to do.” Lyn Bishop, 73, a retired secretary, agrees. “The sooner we get back to normal, the better. I think it’s time really. I’m not nervous about it because I take my own precautions.” A 64-year-old retired officer worker who gave her name only as Stef, says she takes her inspiration from the monarch, saying: “The Queen has got it and she’s not panicking.” She adds: “The whole thing is different now: it is not 2020, we’ve got the vaccines, we’ve got the treatments. We shouldn’t say ‘herd immunity’ but we have built up resistance in the community.” “I’ve known umpteen people who have had it and only two who have been hospitalised and they are fine now. I’m sitting here with no mask and I don’t feel vulnerable.”",News/World news,"‘It’s too soon to be changing’: the view from Horsham, England’s Covid capital",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/its-too-soon-to-be-changing-the-view-from-horsham-englands-covid-capital
2/22/2022,"Cabinet ministers were already waiting in No 10 on Monday morning when it became clear the sign-off for the prime minister’s much-anticipated end to Covid regulations was not going to be as perfunctory as they had imagined. A festering row between Rishi Sunak’s Treasury and Sajid Javid’s health department was responsible, first reported by the Guardian last week and still unresolved.  Few cabinet colleagues had much sympathy with Javid’s demands for extra cash to continue some Covid testing programmes beyond next month. “We are pushing through a hugely unpopular tax rise for his budget,” one cabinet minister said of the impending £12bn healthcare levy, funded by a national rise. “He’s got a budget that is triple the defence budget. No one can say he is being squeezed.” But privately some were horrified by the scramble to agree a deal between the Treasury and Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) just hours before the prime minister’s announcement. One Tory MP called it a “shambles” and said it returned doubts about the No 10 operation to the forefront of colleagues’ minds. “We thought this had been signed off days ago,” one grumbled. “Why is the prime minister calling a cabinet meeting when the details aren’t finished?” As word leaked out that ministers were being turned away from the delayed meeting, No 10 began by suggesting Boris Johnson’s briefing on Ukraine had overrun. But it soon became apparent that there was ongoing wrangling between Javid and Sunak over the future of testing for NHS staff in particular, and Covid surveillance programmes. It was an awkward few hours before the final agreement was done. The cabinet was hastily reconvened on Microsoft Teams, with ministers given less than 10 minutes’ notice of the 1.30pm meeting. Although his department has consistently denied requesting more cash, multiple sources said Javid was fighting to keep billions of pounds extra in funding to continue some free testing, including free lateral flow tests for symptomatic over-50s, but this was rejected by the Treasury. Over the previous week, sources said Javid had reduced his demands for additional funds but argued consistently for maintaining testing programmes designed to monitor new variants and surges. In the end, both sides claimed victory, with health sources saying Sunak had wanted to scrap the surveillance system completely. But one cabinet minister called the result a “total victory” for Sunak, saying the Treasury stuck to its original plans to cut Covid budgets by almost 90% and that Javid had to find the funds from his existing healthcare settlement. Johnson gave his backing to the chancellor’s refusal to agree further funds. Javid now faces the unenviable task of finding funding within his budget to continue surveillance programmes like the Office for National Statistics survey without hitting funds designated to clear the NHS backlog. A health source said Javid had always been arguing to be able to “reprioritise” within his budget, saying the health secretary understood the “fiscal case” to end most free testing. Yet as Johnson appeared before MPs to loud criticism from Labour and the SNP for the decision to end free Covid tests, several ministers remarked at how isolated Javid had been at cabinet for his push to retain some free testing. “Cabinet is pretty united on this direction,” one source said. Those Tory MPs who have doubts about whether the strategy is shortsighted have largely remained quiet. Greg Clark, the former cabinet minister, asked tentatively in the Commons how long it would take to restart mass testing should it be needed, but did not make the case to retain more of the programme. For the most part, as he announced the end of a testing regime which Johnson had once heralded as the envy of the world, Tory MPs cheered him on – arguably the most united the government benches had been in months.",News/World news,Tory row over testing casts shadow over PM’s Covid announcement,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/tory-row-over-testing-casts-shadow-over-pms-covid-announcement
2/22/2022,"Ofwat, the water regulator, has noticed that the industry it oversees in England and Wales has been in the news recently. So it has been. Discharges of raw sewage into rivers and coastal waters are a scandal happening in plain sight, and each set of data feels more shocking than the last. A highly critical report from MPs on the environmental audit committee in January made a strong case that Ofwat itself, plus the Environment Agency, should be more assertive. And here comes a regulatory response of a sort to the “current high level of scrutiny” of the sector: a letter from David Black, Ofwat’s interim chief executive, to the chairs of remuneration committees of the water firms suggesting, in a roundabout way, that bosses’ bonuses should be cut if the pollution record is poor.  The letter is the first of its kind and acts on one of the MPs’ suggestions, but one cannot call it strongly worded. Performance-related pay should show “a substantial link” to delivery for customers, including on “environmental commitments and obligations”, wrote Black, which is hardly laying down the law. There was a reminder to boards that they are allowed to recognise shortfalls “whatever the initial framework for [pay] incentives”, which is just a statement of something the directors should know already: bonuses are always discretionary. One could say, generously, that Ofwat is merely at the preliminary stage of issuing a high-level warning and that tougher tactics could follow. The problem with that interpretation, though, is that Black didn’t specify what penalties would be imposed if his appeal for good behaviour on pay and bonuses is ignored, which must be a possibility. In recent press interviews, he has hinted at fines or changes to licence conditions, but the letter itself only said Ofwat would be “assessing your company’s approach” and did not describe possible sanctions. Maybe the pay-setters will come cleanly, as it were. But Ofwat, which is under scrutiny as much as the companies, would help itself if it laid out specific examples of unacceptable pay practices. Curbing boardroom bonuses for polluters is a good idea. But the policy requires the regulator to be stronger than it currently sounds. Never trust a bidder’s claim that its offer is “full and fair”. Kuwait’s National Aviation Services uttered the supposedly significant words when it was pitching 510p a share for the Edinburgh-based aviation services group John Menzies. Now it’s offering 608p, a mighty 19% improvement that exposes last week’s boasts as so much guff. Barring the (unlikely) arrival of a new bidder, 608p, or £559m, will be enough to win. Indeed, the Kuwaitis had already bought almost 20% of Menzies in the market last week, which undermined the ability of the target’s board to put up a fight. If your big shareholders aren’t with you, resistance is futile. A “willing to recommend” statement duly followed. For a few reasons, it feels a shame. First, because Menzies’ chairman and chief executive, Philipp Joeinig, was making a decent case for continued independence, inviting investors to look beyond the pandemic’s effect on a share price that was 288p before the excitement started. Second, because Menzies is the larger company and has indeed fallen to an opportunistically timed bid, albeit one at a fat notional premium. Third, because we have learned, for the umpteenth time, that too many mid-tier companies look basically cheap when viewed from abroad; the UK takeover door continues to be wide open. A sea change has occurred in UK boardrooms, according to the Department for Business, and, up to a point, it is correct. Women hold 39% of board positions at FTSE 100 companies compared with just 12.5% in 2011, the year Lord Davies’ high-profile report voiced worries that the UK percentage seemed to have reached a plateau and urged a faster pace of progress. On a simple headcount measure of female presence in top boardrooms, the UK now ranks second to France in international tables and has overtaken quota-friendly Norway. Yet the seascape appears all too familiar in another way. While FTSE 100 companies have recruited many more women to their non-executive ranks, the executive picture is almost unchanged. There were five female FTSE 100 chief executives in 2011; now there are eight. At that rate of change, rough parity will be achieved sometime around the middle of the next century.",News/Business,It’s time Ofwat hit the polluters where it hurts – in their bonuses | Nils Pratley,https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2022/feb/21/time-ofwat-hit-water-polluters-where-hurts-bonuses-raw-sewage-discharges
2/22/2022,"Good morning. Sydney residents can expect more train troubles today, with limited services to resume after Monday’s shutdown as the dispute between the rail union and the NSW government continues. More strikes are “inevitable” this year if the NSW government refuses to scrap its 2.5% wages cap, say unions after rail chaos hit Sydney. A long-running industrial dispute between the Rail, Tram and Bus Union and NSW government saw staff across the state’s transport network “locked out” and train services ground to a halt on Monday. The transport union has accused the NSW government of playing politics with commuters, and the state government has ramped up its anti-union rhetoric, with the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, describing the action as a “coordinated attack by the Labor party and the union movement”. The NSW transport minister, David Elliott, liked it to “terrorist-like activity”, then accused RTBU of acting like “cowards”, spreading “bullshit” and “hijacking the city”.  A majority of Australian voters see China and the bilateral relationship as a complex issue to be managed (61%) rather than a threat to be confronted (26%), and more voters trust Labor than the Coalition to manage that complexity, the latest Guardian Essential poll suggests. Despite Scott Morrison last week repeatedly saying Labor is “weak” on security threats and declaring that only the Coalition would not “appease” Beijing, the opposition currently maintains a nine-point lead over the Coalition when people are asked which party they trust to manage the Australia-China relationship. Vladimir Putin will recognise the Russia-controlled territories in south-east Ukraine as independent states in a pivotal decision, scuttling an existing peace agreement and possibly triggering tough new sanctions from the west. According to the Kremlin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron “expressed their disappointment with this development of the situation” but “indicated their readiness to continue contacts”. The German leader earlier warned that “such a step would be a gross contradiction of the Minsk agreement for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in east Ukraine and a unilateral breach of these deals from the Russian side.” France and Germany are both signatories of the Minsk agreement, a peace deal that will likely be abandoned as a result of the Russian decision. The Coalition government has pledged $804m for strategic and scientific programs in Antarctica and to ensure the increasingly contested region is “free from conflict”.

Boris Johnson has announced the end of all domestic Covid restrictions in England in a process starting later this week. Free Covid testing will end for the general public from 1 April and people with positive cases will no longer legally have to isolate.

Six divvy vans turned up, cut the whole street off, and the whole pub evacuated in two minutes. We were running down the street with our amplifiers trying to get out of there. It was insane.” People’s experience of amputation differs. Jane Nicholls shares the story of having her leg “chopped off above the knee” after an unexplained blood clot in an artery in her lower leg. “I have a conical vestige of a leg. People call that my ‘stump’. Ugly word. I call it ‘my leg’. It is my leg,” she writes. “You dread an above-knee amputation. It changes your life. The knee has a crucial role in maintaining balance. If your leg is amputated below the knee, you can still do most of the things you used to do. I can’t run. Climbing steps can be terrifying. I can’t ride a bike. My life is about maintaining my balance. Not falling over.” There’s no denying that polyester clothing is an environmental hazard – it doesn’t biodegrade in landfill, virgin polyester is derived from fossil fuels, and it sheds plastic microfibres when it is washed and worn.

Since it’s very likely we all have something made from polyester in our wardrobes, here is some expert advice on how to minimise its impact.

2/22/2022,"Britain believes there are figures within Russian military and security services who have “serious doubts” about invading Ukraine as the Kremlin continues to move more troops within 50km of the border. The claim, made on Monday, is understood to be based on western intelligence, although the concerns that exist are not expected to have any initial impact if President Vladimir Putin were to order an attack.  “There are elements within the military and Russian security services who harbour very serious doubts about the plan to invade and its effectiveness,” said one western official, who added they were “perfectly confident” about the assessment. However, no further evidence was offered to back up the statement, one of a number of intelligence-led warnings made by the US, UK and others in the past fortnight, all part of a wider political effort to try to demonstrate that the west has an understanding of Russia, its plans and intentions. Any invasion of Ukraine would be fraught with risk, in what would be the largest war in Europe since the second world war. It would pit 150,000 Russian troops, plus another 30,000 separatists, against a regular Ukrainian army of 145,000 plus tens of thousands of paramilitaries, many of whom have military experience. But Putin’s dominance of the Russian political and security scene has meant that any internal concerns about an invasion has been muted. Downing Street said on Monday that there still remained a “window for diplomacy” to resolve the crisis, but added that repeated complaints by the Kremlin that Ukraine had engaged in military provocations in the eastern Donbas region had suggested a plan to attack had already been decided upon. “Intelligence we are seeing suggests Russia intends to launch an invasion and President Putin’s plan has in effect already begun,” a No 10 spokesperson said. “We are seeing elements of the Russian playbook we would expect to see in those situations starting to play out in real time.” The western assessment is that Russian forces are now “poised to invade” if Putin gives the order. It is estimated two-thirds of Russia’s 110 battalions in the region have taken up positions within 50km of the border in both Russian and neighbouring Belarus, an increase from half a week ago. Half of those two-thirds are “tactically deployed” in temporary or makeshift locations even close to Ukraine, where they are awaiting further orders. Defence sources said they could stay in position “for a matter of days” before having to retreat to nearby staging areas, with better facilities. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said that the continued build up of Russian forces monitored by western intelligence did not suggest that the Kremlin was ready to ease tensions. “These are not the actions of a Russian government fulfilling its repeated declarations that it has no intention of invading Ukraine,” he told MPs. Updating MPs, the minister said there had been “a proliferation of false flag operations and propaganda stunts and Russian news outlets carrying fictitious allegations”. Russian officials said five “saboteurs” who tried to breach its border with Ukraine have been killed in the Rostov region were killed. Ukrainian armed vehicles were also destroyed, Russia said. Ukraine said its forces were not operating in the Rostov region and that such claims were “fake news”. Western officials added that Russia had access to a supply of Ukrainian military vehicles captured in 2014-15, when fighting between the two countries was at its most intense, which were available for “false flag” operations. British sources also sounded a note of caution about the efforts of France’s President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday to set up a summit meeting between US president Joe Biden and Putin, arguing that Ukraine had to be closely involved if there were to be direct negotiations between the two leaders. A UK government source said it was “too early” to say whether the summit was a good idea although opportunities for diplomacy were welcome. “We need to make sure Ukraine is played in and we have our set position on Ukraine’s sovereignty and their right to choose on things like Nato and that will remain,” they added.",News/World news,UK says ‘serious doubts’ exist within Russian military about invading Ukraine ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/21/uk-says-serious-doubts-exist-within-russian-military-about-invading-ukraine
