3/12/2022,"The Russian government and general prosecutor's office are considering a proposal to nationalize the assets of foreign companies that are suspending operations or pulling out of Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, the Russian newspaper Izvestia reported Thursday. The report included a list of nearly 60 companies, including McDonald's, Apple, IKEA, Microsoft, IBM, and Porsche. ""All of these businesses have offices, buildings, factories, storefronts in Russia"" that could be ""forcibly taken by the state,"" BBC News reports. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki publicly warned the Kremlin last Thursday that ""any lawless decision by Russia to seize the assets of these companies will ultimately result in even more economic pain for Russia."" She said nationalizing foreign assets would squander any trust Russia has built up since it scared off all foreign investors in the Bolshevik Revolution. Earlier this week, Russia effectively legalized patent theft, issuing a decree that patent protections will not be enforced for anyone affiliated with its list of ""unfriendly"" countries. President Biden, meanwhile, is expected to announce on Friday the removal of Russia's ""most favored nation"" trade status, in concert with the European Union and G-7 nations. That will allow the U.S. and its allies to slap tariffs on any Russian imports not already blocked by mounting sanctions. Fitch on Wednesday joined the other two major credit rating agencies and downgraded Russia's sovereign credit to junk status, warning of an ""imminent"" default on Russia's sovereign debt. ""The downgrades are signals to investors to steer clear of Russia,"" but a default ""could have far more sweeping consequences, sending lenders scurrying for financial high ground and fleeing developing international markets that rely on risk-tolerant investors,"" The Washington Post reports. A default would also create ""tremendous economic hardship for ordinary"" Russians. ""Over the very short term, Russia is a pariah,"" said George Ball, chairman of Houston-based financial services firm Sanders Morris Harris. ""Whether it's their oil, their economy or their sovereign debt, nobody wants to touch it. ... People who have assets in Russia or deposits in Russia are toast for now and for some time ahead. They can't get their hands on money or securities or goods or services. They are outcast and they will over the shorter term freeze to death.""

3/12/2022,"The massive convoy of Russian military vehicles that was slowly heading toward Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, appears to have largely dispersed and redeployed elsewhere, new satellite images show. Driving the news: The convoy was previously estimated to stretch for 40 miles. It massed outside Kyiv last week. But U.S. and U.K. officials said it had ""stalled"" due to fuel and food shortages, amid reports Ukrainian fighter jets have been striking the vehicles.

Photo: Maxar Technologies Between the lines: Maxar Technologies captured satellite images that capture armored units maneuvering in and through the surrounding towns northwest of Kyiv, near Antonov Airport. Elements of the convoy further north appear to have repositioned and been deployed in forests and along tree lines near the town of Lubyanka, with towed artillery howitzers in firing positions nearby, according to Maxar. What they're saying: A U.S. defense official told AP in recent days some vehicles ""were seen moving off the road into the tree line,"" but they couldn't tell whether the Russian military column had broken up. The U.K. Ministry of Defense said in an intelligence update Thursday that the convoy ""has made little progress in over a week and is suffering continued losses at the hands of the Ukrainian Armed Forces."" But it added on Friday that it expected Russian forces to ""reset and re-posture,"" ready for a fresh assault in the coming days, with an attack on Kyiv likely. The bottom line: ""It remains highly unlikely that Russia has successfully achieved the objectives outlined in its pre-invasion plan,"" the U.K. Defense Ministry said in its Friday intelligence. ""Russian ground forces continue to make limited progress. Logistical issues that have hampered the Russian advance persist, as does strong Ukrainian resistance,"" it said.

3/12/2022,"Facebook is changing a rule that prohibits users from calling for violence in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The change, which was first reported by Reuters, allows people in Ukraine and a handful of other countries “to call for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers in the context of the Ukraine invasion.” People in Ukraine, Poland and Russia are also permitted to “call for death to Russian President Vladimir Putin or Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.” Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone said in a statement that the company was ""temporarily” allowing some posts that in the past would have been taken down under the company’s rules prohibiting inciting violence. He added that the company won’t allow “credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.” The company will also take down specific credible threats against Putin and Lukashenko, according to a memo reported by Reuters. “As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders,’” Stone said. “We still won’t allow credible calls for violence against Russian civilians.” Russia has responded to the rule changing, saying that Washington must stop the ""extremist activities"" of Meta, Reuters has reported. The change underscores just how much social media platforms are rushing to adapt their content policies amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Facebook has already taken several steps to limit the influence of Russian state media outlets and took down a network of fake accounts boosting pro-Russia propaganda. The Russian government has responded by banning Facebook.
