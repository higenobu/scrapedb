2/11/2022,"Ido love a financial thriller. It’s such a palate-cleanser, given a television diet comprised mostly of the psychological kind. Our screens are full of people working from hidden, emotional motives that must be carefully developed and depicted, enacting revenges, delivering bespoke justice for crimes old and new that have struck at the heart of their families, bereaved them or otherwise made the protagonist’s life an inescapable misery. You are asked to engage, identify and feel along with them. You need a break, after a while. A financial thriller, by contrast, is a rejuvenating thing, the small-screen equivalent of one of Bertie Wooster’s “liveners”. Why are all these people doing whatever it is they’re doing? Money! Why is that man dead? He had money! Or he was stopping the other people getting more money! What are they doing with all those computers? Getting money! Why do they want the money? Because they want money! All it has to do is keep these kinds of questions – and the single answer – coming until the story ends and the money ends up with the right people. Or doesn’t. Who cares? It’s just money and that’s the joy of the thing.  So, then, to a fine example of the form – The Fear Index (Sky Atlantic), a four-part adaptation of the Robert Harris 2011 bestseller of the same name. I have read the book and, in true financial thriller reading tradition, remember exactly what happens in each scene the moment after it has finished playing out on screen. I do remember there is money involved. And some computers. This time round, though, there is also Josh Hartnett! He plays the man who has the money and the computers – hedge fund founder and money-science-computer-business-genius Dr Alexander Hoffman. He and his charismatic/showboating CEO Hugo Quarry (Arsher Ali) are about to seek a new round of funding from all the rich people who already invest in the company, plus some new ones, because you can never have enough rich people investing in your company, as I understand it. Hoffman has just invented a … an … algorithm? Artificial intelligence system? Whole computer with extra clever bits stuck on? Don’t know, but it’s a MacGuffin called VIXAL-4 and what it does is, like, crunch loads and loads and loads of data and use it to predict events like what no human ever could. ’S amazing. Dr H almost misses the important meeting with the rich investors, however, because he has been spooked by the events of the night before. To wit: someone (not his wife, nor anyone else who knew about his interest in it) has sent him a first edition of Charles Darwin’s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. Someone bypasses his state-of-the-art (there is no other kind when you are a money-science-computer-business-genius person) security system. A straggly haired intruder enters the house and knocks Big H unconscious. According to the book dealer, Hoffman ordered the book himself; the straggly haired intruder looks exactly like one of the terrified faces printed in the 1872 book. Is someone messing with Dr H’s mind or is his own mind becoming a mess? But wait – what’s the money doing? Well, you will be glad to know that it is increasing! The VIXAL-4 MacGuffin has been up and running for a week and the investors are delighted to learn that it has made them – and excuse the technical jargon here – absolutely oodles of cash. To the behind-the-scenes protests of risk manager Marieme (Aïssa Maïga) about the hellish risk-exposure levels involved in using the AI, the bullish Quarry and the distracted Hoffman pay scant regard. But I’m sure everything will be fine. I jest, of course. Layer upon layer of mystery, tension and complication pile up satisfyingly quickly, as whoever is infiltrating Hoffman’s life and security code begins to reveal more and more of their intervening hand. Unless, of course, everything is Hoffman’s paranoid delusion. The power of VIXAL-4 to foresee and to profit accordingly from disasters no human could have foreseen becomes increasingly unsettling. Fear of losing your mind, fear of the unknown, fear of the robots taking over our lives, fear of failure and of danger and humanity’s fearsomely predictable responses to it all entwine nicely, somewhere around the viewers’ throats. It’s solid, satisfying stuff. And it is given a remarkable lift by Hartnett, who invests Hoffman with a palpable, credible and increasingly corrosive fearfulness from the off. It feels real. It looks as if he is truly suffering, and he is a notable number of steps up from the occasional moments of hyperventilation and darting eyes at crunch points in the plot, which is all that the leading man is usually allowed in these things.

2/11/2022,"The spread of Havana syndrome has “dramatically hurt” morale in the US diplomatic corps and affected recruitment, according to the head of the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). Eric Rubin, whose association represents nearly 17,000 current and former diplomats and foreign aid workers, said it was getting harder to find young people to work abroad, because of concerns about Havana syndrome – and about whether the government would look after them if they got sick.  “People have suffered real trauma and real injury, and it has dramatically hurt our morale, our readiness, our ability to recruit new members in the foreign service,” Rubin told the first medical symposium on the syndrome since it began affecting US diplomats and intelligence officers in 2016, organised by the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The cause of the syndrome, which involves long-term loss of balance and cognitive function, remains a mystery. A report by a US intelligence panel of experts last week found that pulsed electromagnetic energy and ultrasound were plausible causes in at least some cases. A CIA assessment made public last month however determined that the majority of the thousand possible cases reported were most likely not the result of a global campaign by a foreign power, while in some two dozen incidents the cause could not be explained. Rubin did not speculate over the cause, but said that the syndrome was having a potentially serious effect on US diplomacy. “It is getting harder when we recruit people,” the AFSA president said. “I’ve had young members of the cohort that’s coming into the foreign service ask me: ‘If I do this, what am I getting into? And is this going to get worse? Is this going to get solved? If I get attacked and if I get injured, who’s gonna be there for me?’ “We’ve got to address that,” Rubin said. Rubin said that care was improving for US officials who have been affected, but that the AFSA was still encountering bureaucratic resistance. “We pushed really hard,” he said. “We did succeed, but it’s still case-by-case.” Kenneth Dekleva, a former state department medical officer and psychiatrist who is leading an effort at UT Southwestern to coordinate research on Havana syndrome, said that psychogenic explanations for the spread of the symptoms were not convincing. “Most diplomats – I would say 99% – want to be overseas, they want to serve their country with dignity and honor, and they want to be healthy,” Dekleva told the Guardian. “They don’t want to assume a patient role. And there’s no gain from it. The burden of illness and suffering is very real for the people. And I find that compelling.”",News/US news,"Havana syndrome has ‘dramatically hurt’ morale, US diplomats say",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/10/havana-syndrome-cuba-us-diplomats-afsa
2/11/2022,"St Helens began their quest for an unprecedented fourth successive Super League title with victory against last season’s beaten Grand Finalists, Catalans Dragons. The Saints, aiming to achieve what no side has in the summer era, showed many of the hallmarks here which have seen them dominate Super League for the past three seasons. Four first-half tries in 15 minutes ultimately proved to be the difference against a Catalans side who will again be among their closest contenders.  However, they finished this game with 12 men after a fiery and often tempestuous contest was typified by a red card for the Dragons’ debutant Dylan Napa after a high shot on Mark Percival in the closing stages. Catalans still stood a chance of winning until that point in proceedings, but Napa’s red card ultimately ended their challenge. It took less than a minute for the new season to ignite. From the opening set of the game an almighty brawl erupted, with Gil Dudson at the heart of it after taking the inaugural carry. He was ultimately sin-binned but, to Catalans’ credit, their defence held up commendably for the 10 minutes without him. Shortly after he returned, Catalans took full advantage of the numerical parity to cross for the game’s opening try. Josh Drinkwater’s well-weighted kick found Fouad Yaha in the corner, with Sam Tomkins converting to give the visitors a 6-0 lead. However as the half wore on, the champions began to find their stride. It began to feel inevitable that the Saints’ first try was looming, and eventually it arrived when Sione Mata’utia’s half-break was supported by Tommy Makinson. Four minutes later, Konrad Hurrell’s magnificent offload found James Roby, with the St Helens captain marking the start of his 19th season as a professional with a try. Lewis Dodd then produced an instinctive piece of play, kicking through and outpacing Tomkins to collect and ground. Catalans were struggling to contain the champions, who had fully clicked into gear: they scored their fourth in 15 minutes when slick hands enabled Makinson to claim his second. The only negative for the Saints? They missed all four conversions –Dodd missing three of them and Makinson missing the simplest of all in front of the posts – meaning that their lead was only 10 points when it arguably could have been a lot more. Tomkins was more accurate at the other end, though, as he kicked his second via a penalty on the stroke of half-time to reduce the arrears to eight. While the latter stages of that first half were dominated by blistering attack from the hosts, the second half was much more of a battle, with defences very much on top. That was underlined by the only points in the first 20 minutes after half-time coming from the boot. St Helens finally found their range from the tee, with Dodd kicking a penalty to push the hosts’ lead back out to 10 points heading into the final quarter. With the lead just 10, the door was ajar for Catalans to mount a late comeback in the closing stages. But as the Saints continued to frustrate the Dragons, Napa was sent off after a dangerous challenge on Percival. Then, with six minutes remaining, the hosts finally put the contest to bed when Joey Lussick scampered across from close range, before the impressive Hurrell capped off his debut with a try.

2/11/2022,"Abortions performed by registered providers in Texas fell by 60% in the first month after the state passed the most restrictive abortion law in the US in decades, according to new figures. Nearly 2,200 abortions were reported by Texas providers in September after a new law took effect that bans the procedure once cardiac activity is detected, usually around six weeks of pregnancy and when many do not know they are pregnant. The law is without exception in cases of rape or incest.  The figures were released this month by the Texas Health and Human Services commission. In August, there had been more than 5,400 abortions statewide. State health officials said more data will be released on a monthly basis. The numbers offer a fuller picture of the sharp drop in patients that Texas doctors have described in their clinics over the past five months, during which time courts have repeatedly allowed the restrictions to stay in place. It has left some Texas patients traveling hundreds of miles to clinics in neighboring states or farther, causing a backlog of appointments in those places. People seeking legal abortions have traveled to Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Arkansas and Louisiana, according to reporting by The Dallas Morning News. The first month after #SB8 took effect, abortions in Texas dropped almost 60% – not because people stopped needing care.Instead, Texans started traveling 300+ miles to out-of-state clinics, which struggle to keep up with demand.Abolish SB8.https://t.co/tLokTzKX9m The Texas law conflicts with the landmark US supreme court ruling Roe v Wade, and other rulings, that prevent a state from banning abortion early in pregnancy, but was written in a way that has essentially outmaneuvered those precedents. Under the law, any private citizen is entitled to make a claim for $10,000 or more by bringing a lawsuit against someone who performed or helped a woman obtain an abortion after the limit – which opponents have condemned as a bounty. So far, no anti-abortion supporters have filed any suits. Texas Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, issued a statement saying “the success of the Texas Heartbeat Act is embodied by every child saved”. Texas abortion providers have acknowledged the law is likely to stay on the books for the foreseeable future. It comes as the supreme court has signaled a willingness to weaken or reverse the Roe v Wade precedent in a ruling that is expected in June. Abortion providers in more liberal states, such as California, Illinois and New York, are expanding clinics and boosting travel assistance to prepare for an influx of patients from conservative states if the US supreme court does end or severely undermine the constitutional right to the procedure.

2/11/2022,"Gregor Townsend has ripped a page from South Africa’s playbook by changing Scotland’s entire front row as he goes in search of a first win in Cardiff in 20 years. Pierre Schoeman, Stuart McInally and WP Nel start against Wales this weekend as Rory Sutherland, George Turner and Zander Ferguson make their way to the bench. “We’ve learned a lot of things over the last couple of years,” Scotland’s head coach said. “One thing from playing against South Africa was to have a strong front row right at the end of the game.”  The Springboks lifted the 2019 World Cup and won last years’ British and Irish Lions series by changing their front row all at once, ensuring that their scrum and maul remained a threat throughout the contest. Last week, in a thrilling victory over England in the Edinburgh rain, Scotland did the same and their scrum survived several resets at the death, stubbornly resisting a penalty and holding firm for a three point win. “We’ve got real depth in our front row,” said Towsend. “We want to use them so they’re fresh and can take Wales on in the second half.” Not a lot worked for Wales in their 29-7 loss to Ireland, but their set-piece, so often a source of pride, was an especially notable weak point. They lost one scrum and four line-outs as their pack was outmuscled in Dublin. Head coach Wayne Pivac has chosen to address the cause of his ailments, rather than what he views as its symptom. Rory Moriarty returns to the team at the base of the scrum while two open side flankers take their position either side of him. Taine Basham keeps his place while 22-year-old Jac Morgan makes his Test debut. Wales: L Williams; Cuthbert, Watkin, Tompkins, Rees-Zammit; Biggar (cap), T Williams; Jones, Elias, Francis, Rowlands, Beard, Basham, Morgan, Moriarty. Replacements: Lake, Thomas, Lewis, GS Davies, Wainwright, G Davies, Sheedy, J Davies Scotland: Hogg (cap); Graham, Harris, Tuipulotu, Van der Merwe; Russell, Price; Schoeman, McInally, Nel, Gray, Gilchrist, Skinner, Watson, M Fagerson. Replacements: Turner, Sutherland, Z Fagerson, Bradbury, Darge, White, Kinghorn, Redpath “It’s well documented that we didn’t get what we wanted to in Dublin, and part of that was getting parity in the physical side of the game,” Pivac said. “Whether that’s ball carrying, cleaning rucks, in defence; we came up short. [The loose forwards] give us more speed. They give us something different.” There is a catch, though. Scotland’s line-out was faultless in securing clean ball against England and Pivac’s loose trio will scarcely worry Townsend’s towers. “They’re not the tallest of men,” Pivac conceded. “We have to be a little creative with what we do there. It’s a good challenge for the coaches.” So speed will be the name of the game. Townsend has anticipated this by selecting Sione Tuipulotu at inside centre. It will be a first start for the Australian-born utility back after debuting last week from the bench. “He’s a very creative player,” said Townsend. “He can bring others into play and has his own running game. But defence is the number one. Coming into our midfield you know you have to defend very well, and that’s something he’s been doing very well in training.” There are other changes in the Scottish pack as Jamie Ritchie’s hamstring required surgery this week and he remains in doubt for Scotland’s July tour of Argentina. Exeter’s Sam Skinner gets the opportunity in a tight five that will be held to a higher standard this week. “We can do more in the maul and scrum,” Townsend said. “[The England game] was a seven out of 10 performance. We need an eight or a nine.” Worrying for Wales, then. But Pivac says every player in his team is hurting after last week’s dour display. “We expect a bigger performance. We’ll have to wait until Saturday to see if it’s big enough.”",Sport/Sport,Scotland follow Springboks’ lead and change entire front row for Wales clash,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/10/scotland-wales-six-nations-rugby-preview
2/11/2022,"Dan Brown’s compulsive, contentious story of Catholic conspiracy, misogyny and murderous Opus Dei monks was nothing if not knotty in book form, and no less so in Ron Howard’s film adaptation. Now comes Luke Sheppard’s theatre production, which manages to navigate those complicated plot turns as well as the story’s many changes in time and place. Nigel Harman is Robert Langdon, the professor and symbolist, with Hannah Rose Caton playing his fellow fugitive adventurer, police cryptologist Sophie Neveu. Judicious decisions are made in this adaptation by Rachel Wagstaff and Duncan Abel to cut away most of the police chase scenes; it means we lose excitement and intrigue but gain a clarity of story from its leanness.  Character development, on the whole, is minimal, as in the book and film, and the strengths lie in visual effects and stagecraft, from David Woodhead’s smoothly changing set to Andrzej Goulding’s striking video projections – of paintings, Fibonacci numbers and sketches – which give the show its fluidity and speed. Ben and Max Ringham’s electronic music adds to the energy and pace. There is plenty of Leonardo da Vinci thrown into the optics, too: we begin with a magnificently enlarged Vitruvian Man, along with luminous projections of the Mona Lisa and the Louvre itself later. The projections signpost changes of time and place effectively, moving from the opening murder of art curator Jacques Saunière to crypts, country houses and a plane journey from Paris to London (clouds whiz by along the stage walls). Actors sit along the sides, sometimes surging forward in choreographed sequences (lifting a character in the air, for example) that work well, but also occasionally chanting in a chorus that feels flat-footed and unnecessary. Harman and Caton have the same platonic chemistry of the film and both actors suit their parts, though Caton is more vivid, bringing sensitivity and heart to her tragic backstory. Harman stays lesser known and seems oddly underused, though he is on stage for much of the show. In a prime example of the challenges theatre still faces in our times, Danny John-Jules, cast as Sir Leigh Teabing, tested positive for Covid and was replaced by Andrew Lewis at the show I saw, which was the last night of previews. Lewis was originally cast to play Saunière so understudy Adam Morris played the murdered curator instead. The actors put in a solid effort, especially Lewis, who brings charm to a key character who is secretly obsessed with uncovering the conspiracy theory that Jesus is human, not divine. But Joshua Lacy as the fanatical monk, Silas, puts in the most committed performance; he does not have the manic zeal of Paul Bettany’s Silas in the film – all for the better – and brings vulnerability as well as physical threat, with the air of a soldier suffering from trauma. The first half of the show sprints through the plot, keeping us alongside, but the second feels as if it is on fast-forward, with scenes changing too quickly and flipping to flashback. And, despite the frenzy of action, the fight scenes are not convincing and it feels a little lacklustre by the end because there is no accompanying tension or jeopardy. But until then, it manages to streamline a complicated story with originality. At Theatre Royal Plymouth until 12 February.

2/11/2022,"The Welsh government is relaxing some Covid restrictions but keeping the requirement for people to isolate if they test positive for Covid. The obligation to show a Covid pass to get into nightclubs, cinemas and theatres will be dropped from 18 February, and people will be able to go into some public places without a face covering 10 days later.  While all Covid regulations in England are set to be abolished in two weeks, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, who himself has tested positive for the virus and is isolating, stressed his government remained cautious. He said on Thursday: “With increasing numbers of people vaccinated and boosted, and thanks to the hard work and efforts of everyone across Wales, we are confident that coronavirus rates are falling and we can look forward to brighter times ahead. “We can start to gradually and carefully remove some of the remaining protections we have in place. But we are not removing all the measures at once because the pandemic is not over yet. “To keep Wales safe we need to remain cautious and do everything we can to reassure those who feel most at risk. We will keep some important protections in place, including face coverings in health and social care settings, on public transport and in all shops. We will also keep self-isolation rules in place.” Drakeford said that next month the Labour-controlled government would publish a plan setting out how it will move beyond the emergency footing on which the country has been operating for nearly two years. “This will help us all to make some plans for the future,” he said. From Friday 18 February, the Covid pass will no longer be required for entry into indoor or outdoor events and venues, including nightclubs, cinemas, theatres and concert halls. But events and venues will be able to continue to use it if they choose to. From Monday 28 February, the requirement to wear face coverings will be removed from most indoor public places, apart from in retail, public transport and health and care settings. The legal requirement to wear face coverings in all remaining settings could be lifted by the end of March.

2/11/2022,"Same old Arsenal. This may have been their first game for two-and-a-half weeks, a few days of which they spent in Dubai, but they ended it with a fourth red card in six matches. If ever there was an episode that epitomised what threatens to undermine Mikel Arteta’s attempt to restore Arsenal to the Champions League, it arrived with 21 minutes left to play. Wolves, for all of their good intent, were at arm’s length, but then Gabriel Martinelli picked up two yellow cards in a matter of seconds – the first for obstructing a throw-in and the second for a hot-headed trip on Chiquinho – and the visitors were reduced to 10 men. It ensured a nervy crescendo for an Arsenal side that looked comfortable after opening up a first-half lead through Gabriel.  Wolves made life difficult in the closing stages but could not find an equaliser. Ben White cleared off the line after Raúl Jimenez clawed a ball back into the box and Aaron Ramsdale tipped a Leander Dendoncker header on to the roof his net. Bruno Lage was livid, punching the air and kicking the perfectly-landscaped ground of his home dugout as the substitute Fábio Silva elected to cross rather than shoot five minutes into second-half stoppage time. After a dry and all-round miserable January – Arsenal picked up three red cards and were sent packing in both domestic cup competitions – Arteta recognised the need to reignite their season, especially given Wolves are among those in the conversation for a top-four berth. Thomas Partey returned to the base of the Arsenal midfield alongside Granit Xhaka, himself back from a ban, and Cédric Soares at right-back, allowing White to partner Gabriel in the heart of defence. White had Arsenal’s first real glimpse of goal. Martin Ødegaard slid in Bukayo Saka and the latter cut the ball back for White, who roamed into the box, but Conor Coady blocked his first-time shot. Until then, a Wolves defence that welcomed back Romain Saiss – whose shirt collar was embroidered with the name of Rayan Awram, who tragically lost his life in northern Morocco last week –appeared typically comfortable; only Manchester City have conceded fewer top-flight goals. A couple of minutes later Soares curled a delicious cross in from the right but Alexandre Lacazette failed to make any contact at the front post. Arsenal had to make do with a corner, won by Martinelli, who enjoyed a couple of electrifying solo runs in a first half that wriggled away from Wolves. Martinelli’s in-swinging corner was not dealt with, only half-cleared to White, whose header maintained the heat in Wolves’ six-yard box. The Wolves goalkeeper, José Pedro Malheiro de Sa, tried to clear but inadvertently collided with Lacazette, allowing the Arsenal striker to flick the ball on and Gabriel tapped in from close range. Arteta liked what he was seeing, applauding on the touchline and, at one point, cajoled four players – Ødegaard, Martinelli, Soares and Kieran Tierney – to crowd out Daniel Podence, who had caused some early problems for Arsenal. Wolves were without João Moutinho because of a calf injury but his midfield sidekick, Rúben Neves, sent in a teasing cross for Dendoncker after Podence switched possession. Partey was alert to it but the ball bobbled off his right knee and via Dendoncker’s shoulder before flying into Ramsdale’s grasp. Nelson Semedo dropped a shot wide just before the interval and Jimenez sent a tame header straight at Ramsdale. Bruno Lage was then bouncing in his technical area after Wolves failed to capitalise on another opening as they outwitted Arsenal with a quick free-kick and Trincão chopped inside Martinelli, only to overcook his cross. Wolves’ final ball letting them down proved a recurring theme, as attacks fizzled out. Dendoncker was guilty of sending in a cross that was easy prey for Ramsdale and then Podence, much to the ire of his team-mates, drove over from more than 30 yards out. Trincão nutmegged Gabriel and worked his way to the edge of the box but his cross was cut out and Lage was cussing when White diverted a Podence shot wide after clever play by Semedo. Wolves were frustrated, particularly with what they deemed to be chronic time wasting by the visitors, of which Gabriel seemed to be the chief culprit. Ramsdale turned to the Sir Jack Hayward Stand and smiled as he calmly beat the Wolves press but little did he know that things were about to get uncomfortable. Martinelli’s dismissal turned this game into attack versus defence, but Arsenal prevailed.",Sport/Football,Gabriel bundles Arsenal past Wolves despite Martinelli’s remarkable red card,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/10/wolves-arsenal-premier-league-match-report
2/11/2022,"Liverpool may be in distant pursuit of Manchester City but the chase goes on, thanks to a player whose chances of overhauling the leader in the scoring stakes may be equally remote. Mohamed Salah could go to Africa for a month and retain a sizeable advantage in the race for the Golden Boot but as he made his comeback in a cameo, Diogo Jota struck twice to ensure Brendan Rodgers’ return to Anfield was a less happy affair. This was not Leicester’s worst result of the week but the manner of Jota’s goals underlined City’s defensive deficiencies and, but for Kasper Schmeichel’s heroics, it might have been a thrashing. Faced with a choice of introducing the new or turning back to the familiar, Jürgen Klopp opted to give Luis Díaz a full debut. The returning Salah was a substitute, perhaps more tired and trusted than tried and trusted after playing extra-time in four matches with Egypt. Klopp nearly got immediate vindication: but for a well-judged intervention from Daniel Amartey, Díaz might have struck in the first minute. The Colombian nevertheless looked at home straight away. A thrillingly direct dribbler who seems to have an extra gear looks a natural Klopp player.  Rodgers had made swingeing changes to the side embarrassed by Nottingham Forest in the FA Cup. Youri Tielemans, the captain on Sunday, was benched, along with Harvey Barnes and Caglar Soyuncu. Rodgers reunited the midfielders Wilfred Ndidi and Amartey at the heart of his defence. Just after Christmas, they became the only centre-back duo to prevent Liverpool from scoring in the Premier League but hopes of a sequel only lasted half an hour. But counterattacking menace brought Leicester their December win and almost led courtesy of a similar move. James Maddison latched on to Trent Alexander-Arnold’s loose pass, played a one-two with Ademola Lookman and advanced to unleash a rising shot that Alisson tipped over the bar. That apart, Leicester were content to soak up pressure. Klopp had predicted Rodgers would reprise his tactic of using a diamond midfield. He did not, settling instead for two banks of four. Liverpool’s attempt to break them down encompassed a particularly courageous effort from Andy Robertson who, in trying to convert Alexander-Arnold’s cross, instead collided with the post. Such bravery was scarcely necessary. The breakthrough came in familiar fashion for both sides. Liverpool had already scored the most goals from set-pieces. Leicester joined Crystal Palace at the top of the table for dead-ball concessions when Alexander-Arnold whipped a corner in, Ndidi left Virgil van Dijk completely unmarked and, while Schmeichel did brilliantly to save his header, Jota swept in the rebound. A second almost arrived in rather more spectacular fashion. With Schmeichel grounded after punching Robertson’s cross away, Thiago Alcãntara marked his first start for seven weeks with an audacious overhead kick from 18 yards. It bounced narrowly wide. An ever busier Schmeichel was required to stop two efforts from Roberto Firmino before the interval and one from Jota straight after, the Portuguese gliding clear to aim a shot for the far corner, plus parrying a deflected cross from Robertson. The Leicester captain had made a string of saves when Liverpool lost at the King Power Stadium and was in similarly defiant mood in the rematch. Amartey joined in the resistance, turning Díaz’s drive past the post. The decibel level for Liverpool’s series of shots, however, was rather lower than when Salah was brought on for a first Anfield appearance of 2022. With the Afcon winner Sadio Mané unavailable — Klopp reported he was still sleeping — the majority present could at least enjoy the fact the losing finalist had returned to Anfield sooner. Rodgers also rolled the dice, sending for Tielemans and Kelechi Iheanacho, though retaining his safety-first shape. Salah set about carrying on where he left off before he left for Cameroon by launching an assault on the Leicester goal. He could have had a hat-trick inside five minutes. First he wriggled away from two defenders for a shot from an acute angle that Schmeichel blocked. When he fooled Ndidi with a cute dummy and sprinted clear from the centre circle, the overworked goalkeeper read an attempt to dink a shot over him. Then a curler thudded against the bar. Schmeichel then denied Díaz a first Liverpool goal with a brilliant stop when Salah released his new team-mate. Instead, Jota belatedly sealed victory after Leicester twice gave the ball away and Joël Matip picked him out. Now Liverpool are only nine points behind the other City.",Sport/Football,Diogo Jota double sinks Leicester to maintain Liverpool’s title pursuit,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/feb/10/liverpool-leicester-premier-league-match-report
