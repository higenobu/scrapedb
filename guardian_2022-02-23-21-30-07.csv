2/23/2022,"Vladimir Putin has said Russia will recognise the territorial claims of its two proxy states in east Ukraine, and has ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory, in a sharp escalation of already high tensions.  The move follows days of warnings by the US and others of the possibility of an imminent Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 22 February a Reuters witness saw columns of military vehicles including tanks and APCs on the outskirts of Donetsk, the capital of one of the territories claimed by Russia: Over the past few months Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric has also grown more belligerent. Putin has demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine will never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he is unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity has done little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long seen as the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers have stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by ally China, have concluded. Scores of battalion tactical groups, the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army consisting of around 800-1,000 troops, have been put in place near the borders of Ukraine in both Russia and latterly Belarus. As of 18 February the US estimated that Russia had between 169,000 and 190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas of Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before Putin’s announcement that he was sending in troops. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment has since grown. Nato has warned that Russian forces in Belarus could reach 30,000, including Speznaz special operations forces, SU-35 fighter jets, S-400 air defence systems and Iskander missiles, which can carry nuclear weapons, and have a range of 500km. Half of Russia’s air force is now deployed near Ukraine, according to western estimates, and Russian warships have been conducting training exercises in the Black Sea. This footage release by the Russian MOD shows a Ka-27PS helicopter taking off and landing on the deck of a frigate during exercises on 22 February: These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year: Satellite photographs also show increased deployments in Novoozernoye in western Crimea. The US estimates 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. This image from 18 February shows deployments including armour, helicopters and field hospitals in Novoozernoye: Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to what the UK defence secretary described as potential launch locations. Putin’s decision to formally recognise the territorial claims of the self-proclaimed republics of Donetsk and Luhansk allows him to justify a further invasion of Ukraine beyond the existing of line of contact. This in turn could be the prelude to a broader conflict. A further invasion could take place on multiple axes, with Russian forces trying to encircle Ukraine’s military in the east of the country, though western intelligence agencies believe the most likely goal of a Russian offensive would be to surround Kyiv and force regime change. Belarus is considered the simplest invasion route to Ukraine’s capital as it would allow Russian forces to cross the large Dniepr river in friendly territory and attack from the west. This runs counter to the thinking in Ukraine as of late January that a focused attack in the east was the most likely scenario. On 21 January Ukrainian military intelligence said that since the beginning of the month Moscow had supplied separatists in eastern Ukraine with additional tanks, self-propelled artillery, mortars and more than 7,000 tons of fuel. A map released by Ukrainian military intelligence in November showed a worst-case scenario: Russian forces crossing the Ukrainian border from the east and attacking from annexed Crimea, as well as launching an amphibious assault on Odessa with support from Russian soldiers in Transnistria and troops sent in from Belarus. Any invasion by Russia into Ukraine will pit the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land and in particular in air and at sea, although the Ukrainians would be defending their homeland. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement, which observers say is close to collapse. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s often repeated demands is a guarantee that Ukraine never joins Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Europe’s most divisive energy project, Nord Stream 2 bypasses the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It has faced resistance within the European Union, and from the United States as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increases Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denies Ukraine transit fees and makes it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",News/World news,The Ukraine-Russia crisis explained: a complete visual guide,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/the-ukraine-russia-crisis-explained-a-complete-visual-guide
2/23/2022,"When Harry Stamper sets off a bomb to save planet Earth in the film Armageddon, his life flashes before his eyes. Now research has revealed tantalising clues that such recall may not be Hollywood hyperbole. An international team of scientists has reported an unexpected situation in which they recorded the brain activity of an 87-year-old patient as he died.  The man had been admitted to a hospital emergency department after a fall that resulted in a bleed in the brain, and subsequently deteriorated. When doctors carried out an electroencephalography (EEG), they discovered the patient had developed epilepsy. However, during the EEG recordings he had experienced a heart attack and died. The team says analysis of recordings of the 30 seconds before and after the man’s heart stopped beating suggest that in his final moments he experienced changes in different types of brain waves, including alpha and gamma brain waves. The team says the findings suggest that the brain’s activity gradually declines, and that interaction between different types of brain wave continues after the blood stops flowing in the brain. But, the researchers add, it also raises an intriguing possibility. “Given that cross-coupling between alpha and gamma activity is involved in cognitive processes and memory recall in healthy subjects, it is intriguing to speculate that such activity could support a last ‘recall of life’ that may take place in the near-death state,” the team writes in the journal Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience. However, the findings are based on the recordings from just one person, and the researchers also urge caution, noting among other factors that traumatic brain injuries and white matter damage can affect brain waves, while activity of networks in the brain can be affected by anticonvulsant medication such as that given to the patient. Nonetheless, the researchers say the results could have important implications. “These findings challenge our understanding of when exactly life ends and generate important subsequent questions, such as those related to the timing of organ donation,” said Dr Ajmal Zemmar, a neurosurgeon at the University of Louisville, US, and a co-author of the study. Prof Anil Seth, a neuroscientist at the University of Sussex who was not involved in the research, said the data was “pretty unique” noting ethically it is not possible to plan the collection of such recordings. But, he added, questions remain. “The study extends previous work from about 10 years ago showing characteristic ‘bursts’ of brain activity in rodents following cardiac arrest, but before complete cessation of brain activity,” he said. “This new study, showing similar findings in a dying human, is both moving and fascinating, but whether the recorded activity underlies any particular kind of subjective experience – whether so-called ‘near death experiences’, or impressions of life flashing before ones eyes – is impossible to say, and will likely remain so.”",News/Science,Does life flash before your eyes?

2/23/2022,"We are a hardcore fundamentalist family on Pancake Day. For most of the year, fluffy American-style pancakes are our go-to five-minute weekend breakfast. But these do not pass muster on Pancake Day. In our house, Shrove Tuesday is a day of crepes, lemon and sugar and aggressively enforced applause whenever I successfully flip one. I don’t expect the whole world to adhere to my pancake orthodoxy, so here are 10 brazenly experimental pancakes for you to try out.  You cannot make a savoury pancake half-heartedly. You must leap in with both feet. Especially if you cook up something like Joe Trivelli’s savoy pancakes. A conscious attempt to blend pancakes with bubble and squeak, they contain mashed potato and boiled cabbage. The end results are dangerously close to being farls but, eaten straight from the pan, are delicious enough to trounce such quibbling. Serve your stack topped with a fried egg. From a 2015 Guardian Readers’ Recipe Swap list, ElleZumbido’s recipe for cheese, thyme and pecan pancakes borders on the ridiculous. Containing an unholy mixture of cheddar, camembert and creme de Saint Agur, the combined cheesiness only slightly mitigated by the addition of honey and toasted pecans, these pancakes seem precision-honed to give you nightmares. As ElleZumbido puts it: “These pancakes are not for the faint-hearted.” As you might expect, Yotam Ottolenghi seizes the opportunity to turn the pancake concept on its head. Riffing on the German dish flaedlesuppe, his lamb broth with pancake “noodles” lets the crepes act as a bulking agent for soup. This is a very time-intensive recipe – to get the lamb to properly fall off the bone, you need to cook it for close to three hours – but the results are well worth the investment. Once the broth is ready, make some pancakes, roll them, slice them and chuck them in at the last minute. The greatest pancake restaurant in the world is, without question, Kompressor in Tallinn, Estonia. When the money is short and the mood is low, you’re guaranteed to leave full and happy. Kompressor’s menu ranges from the conventional (ham and cheese; cheese and tomato) but isn’t afraid to take risks. Enter the herring pancake: vast, thick and (at about £4.60) incredibly cheap. Kompressor keeps its recipes close to its chest, but Culinary Choice’s herring pancake recipe makes a good fist of it. The pancakes are filled with chopped herring, boiled egg and onion with sour creme and dill. You will love this or massively not love it. If I veer from my preference for flat, thin Pancake Day pancakes, I do so with as much panache as possible. Japanese soufflé pancakes are things of absolute wonder – soft, light and tall enough to give you vertigo. As the Kirbie’s Cravings recipe explains, they’re an awful lot of work – you have to make a meringue mixture, fold in your pancake mix, pour into a greased muffin ring and carefully steam under a lid. But if you use Pancake Day as an opportunity to impress people, this is your only serious option. When I lived in Seoul and found myself reluctantly dragged on hikes up Bukhansan, by far the best part of the day was eating the pajeon that greeted me at the bottom of the mountain. A ridiculously hearty pancake, made with corn flour, plain flour and sparkling water, pajeon have seafood and spring onions cooked through them and are best served with a soy and rice vinegar dipping sauce. Most Asian supermarkets will have packets of pre-mixed pajeon powder, but making it from scratch is more fun. We’ll round off this Asian interlude with Good to Know’s recipe for Thai pancakes. They’re filled with a punchy mixture of noodles, curry paste, fish sauce, peanuts, prawns and lime juice, and are eaten dipped in sweet chilli sauce. The recipe stipulates readymade pancakes, but you know better than that. About five years ago, there was a fad for prosecco pancakes which, in hindsight, seems like pre-catastrophe decadence. However, I would argue that they’re still worth a go. This is partly because they are crepes at heart, and thus adhere to my authoritarian stance on Pancake Day. Second, they’re not as ostentatious as they sound. As Bubble Club’s recipe shows, adding prosecco to the batter lightens it, while making a prosecco syrup adds subtle sophistication. I’m not sure I can fully sanction Spoon University’s recipe for peanut butter pickle pancakes, but I’m going to share it. The base of the recipe is a fluffy American pancake. However, a disturbing combination of peanut butter, vanilla extract and a chopped gherkin is added to the mix. Is it good? I’m not brave enough to try, not least because it’s topped with a dribble of pickle juice. Finally, my God, there is the jaffa cake pancake. Another Good to Know idea, these are unbelievable. Make a fluffy pancake, spoon marmalade on top, then pour over melted dark chocolate and let it harden. You are left with something that looks like a jaffa cake, tastes a bit like a jaffa cake and defies all known Pancake Day conventions.",Lifestyle/Food,"Flipping marvellous! 10 delicious – and surprising – pancake recipes, from jaffa cake to peanut butter and gherkin",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/feb/23/flipping-marvellous-10-delicious-and-surprising-pancake-recipes-from-jaffa-cake-to-peanut-butter-and-gherkin
2/23/2022,"A court in Japan has awarded damages for the first time to people who were forcibly sterilised under a now-defunct eugenics law designed to prevent the births of “inferior children”. The Osaka high court overturned a lower court decision and ordered the government to pay a combined ¥27.5m (£175,600) to the three plaintiffs, who are in their 70s and 80s. It described the law, which was abolished in 1996, as “inhumane”.  Courts hearing similar cases have declared that the practice was unconstitutional, but rejected damages claims, saying the 20-year statute of limitations had expired. A lower court had rejected the three plaintiffs’ demand for that reason in 2020 – a ruling the Osaka high court judge said “grossly violates the spirit of justice and fairness”. Japan’s government apologised and awarded compensation to thousands of people in 2019, but the victims’ lawyers said the one-off offer of ¥3.2m did not reflect the suffering the victims had experienced. To date, the government has compensated fewer than 1,000 victims under the scheme, according to the Kyodo news agency. The plaintiffs’ lawyer, Tamano Tsujikawa, said his clients – a married couple with hearing difficulties and a woman with an intellectual disability – had “moved mountains” by communicating their anguish to the judge. “I am happy our claim was accepted,” the woman, who was forcibly sterilised in 1965, said after the verdict, according to public broadcaster NHK, which did not name her. “But the sorrow of having to go through the operation is still with me even now,” she said. Victims and their families welcomed the verdict. “This ruling stands by the victims,” the sister-in-law of a plaintiff in a separate suit in Sendai, north-east Japan, told Kyodo. Saburo Kita, a representative of a group of victims and their families, told the news agency: “Our lives were completely destroyed. This is not about money. With this verdict, I want the government to bow in front of all of the victims and apologise.” Between 1948 and 1996, about 16,500 people, mostly women with disabilities, were operated on without their consent under the law, which aimed to “prevent the birth of poor-quality descendants … and to protect the life and health of the mother”. About 8,000 other people gave their consent – almost certainly under pressure – while almost 60,000 women had abortions because of hereditary illnesses, according to media reports. The eugenics law was abolished in 1996. The health ministry will review the case before deciding whether to appeal, government officials said. The health minister, Shigeyuki Goto, described the verdict as “very tough” for the government.",News/World news,Japan court awards damages to victims of forced sterilisation for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/japan-court-awards-damages-victims-forced-sterilisation-first-time-eugenics-law
2/23/2022,"A play that opens with a woman downing vodka from a Mooncup is hard to come by. Splintered, written and directed by Emily Aboud, is a fantastic night of festivity and foolery. A charismatic trio – Chanté Faucher, Melissa Saint and Alice Vilanculo – are our teachers. “Welcome to Splintered everyone,” they shout. “Are you ready to come out?” Collectively, they educate us on the life of queer women in the Caribbean, reasoning that the homophobia embedded in their culture is founded in the legacy of colonialism. A mix of cabaret, drama and verbatim interviews, this blazing hybrid-form introduces us to their real stories. “Everything you see will be truthful,” the emcees swear.  Fast-paced and brimming with energy, this endlessly political show never stops being playful. In a gloriously queer twist on the song Cell Block Tango from Kander and Ebb’s Chicago, they click in time and whisper “relatable, gay, content”, while narrating the first moment they realised their sexualities. Even when their tales are stained by sadness and shame, it remains a comedy about joy. An expert in merging history lessons with humour, Aboud has created an audience-embracing celebration of the origins of Caribbean carnival. With the sequined costumes designed by Hazel Low and the dramatic accompaniment of the music from Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, the defiantly flamboyant spirit of the festival is deeply woven into every directorial decision. A final voiceover of a queer woman, unable to come out of hiding in Trinidad and Tobago, hits us with a shot of reality. You have to resist and rebel, the emcees say.

2/23/2022,"For what has become his final feature film, director Roger Michell made this sweet-natured and genial comedy in the spirit of Ealing, which bobs up like a ping pong ball on a water-fountain. It is based on the true story of Kempton Bunton, the Newcastle bus driver who in 1965 was had up at the Old Bailey for stealing Goya’s portrait of the Duke of Wellington from London’s National Gallery. The mystery of its disappearance had so electrified the media that there was even a gag about it in the James Bond film Dr No, using a copy personally painted by the legendary production designer Ken Adam, which was itself stolen. Maybe there should be a film about that as well. The court heard this was Bunton’s protest at government misuse of taxpayers’ money (the painting had been saved for the nation at some cost) and to publicise his demand for pensioners to be given free TV licences. (This film features the usual “historical coda” sentences over the closing credits, and one sentimentally records that free TV licences for the over-75s were finally introduced in 2000. But no mention of these being taken away again in 2020.)  If this was actually an Ealing picture, Stanley Holloway might have taken the lead role; as it is, Jim Broadbent plays the cussed and bloody-minded Bunton, a pipe-smoking individualist, autodidact and working man: JB Priestley without the establishment cachet or the university degree. He writes dozens of unpublished novels and unproduced plays, emotionally driven by the tragic death of his daughter, and is briefly imprisoned for refusing to pay his licence on the grounds that he has removed the cathode that allows his set to receive the BBC. (It should be said that there is something a little bit Brexity about him.) His exasperated but loving wife Dorothy is played by Helen Mirren, who gives her all to this slightly underwritten role – at one stage knitting so fiercely that the needles clash like duellists’ sabres. His loyal, decent son Jackie is played by Fionn Whitehead and Jackie’s brother Kenny – imagined here as a bit of a ne’er-do-well – is played by Jack Bandeira. Finally, Bunton makes a trip to London to petition for his cause, a path that takes him to the National Gallery. The screenplay, co-written by Richard Bean and Clive Coleman, may not be 100% historically accurate – could you make a “food order” of fish and chips in a pub in the early 60s? – but it amusingly shows how the police and gallery authorities, anxious to minimise their embarrassment, insisted this audacious crime had to be the work of a sophisticated international criminal gang. And when Bunton’s flowery anonymous notes finally come to light revealing him to be the culprit, the Tory home secretary Rab Butler (robustly played by Richard McCabe) snorts at his rhyming of “fortitude” and “sportitude” and says: “The man’s a bloody poet! Perhaps we can lock WH Auden up at last!” The story of Bunton and the Duke’s portrait is very unusual for a high-concept Britpic in that the true story has a ready-made two-part plot, revealing a mystery you didn’t know was there. There is a second act still to come just before the end, a narrative sting in the tail that is adroitly concealed in the structuring and editing. Broadbent’s performance satisfyingly shows both the public and the private man to be the same: the stubborn eccentric and the individualist who drives Dorothy up the wall, and the born standup comic who in court gets laughs from the jury and the press gallery. There is a fair bit of sentimentality here, but an awful lot of affection and energy as well.  The Duke is released on 25 February in cinemas.",Arts/Film,The Duke review – Jim Broadbent steals show in warm-hearted 60s-set crime caper,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/23/the-duke-review-jim-broadbent-historical-comedy-roger-michell
2/23/2022,"In 1997 Wales voted in favour of devolution by a margin of 50.3%, one of the narrowest victories in British electoral history. Two areas in the country that carried the yes vote were Carmarthenshire and the south Wales valleys, both locations with their own recognisable identities. Carmarthen was the first constituency in Wales to elect a Plaid Cymru MP, the party’s leader Gwynfor Evans, in 1966. Many of the county’s inhabitants regarded Carmarthenshire as part of Y Fro Cymraeg, the Welsh-speaking heartland. The valleys, with its historical tradition of workers’ institutes and mutualism was no less a heartland, one where English was spoken more frequently than the Welsh language, Cymraeg. In each instance a place strongly associated with a distinct form of Welshness voted in favour of devolution. My history of Wales, Brittle With Relics, concludes with the vote in favour of devolution and begins 35 years earlier, with a radio speech that warned Cymraeg would become extinct unless some form of radical, extra-parliamentary action was undertaken. It examines the tensions and arguments within Wales over what constituted Welsh identity during the period and the manner in which these arguments were buffeted by economic and political forces beyond the country’s control.  Today in Wales we are again engaged in an involved conversation about our future. It is a conversation we are finally having on something approaching our own terms. The following books helped me understand how we might distinguish a Welsh form of self-determination. They would all generously oil the wheels of our current national debate. 1. Poems by Lynette Roberts (1944)Of Welsh descent, Roberts was born in Argentina and settled in the village of Llanybri at the age of 30. The years spent away from the country enabled Roberts to write poems steeped in Wales’s language and landscape, while imagining a new form of Welsh identity. Poem from Llanbryni was written in the style of the Welsh invitational poem to her fellow poet Alun Lewis, then serving and shortly to die in Burma. It describes the meal she will cook for Lewis using ingredients taken from the hedgerow and her garden: “At noon-dayI will offer you a choice bowl of cawlServed with a ‘lover’s’ spoon and a chopped sprayOf leeks or savori fach, not used now” Later in the poem, Roberts suggests she and Lewis should conclude their day by raising “our heritage”. It is a heritage composed equally of simple food and a national character that, Roberts implies, is hers and Lewis’s to determine. 2. An Acre of Land by RS Thomas (1952)The title of Brittle With Relics is taken from Thomas’s Welsh Landscape, which begins with the much-quoted lines: “To live in Wales is to be consciousAt dusk of the spilled bloodThat went into the making of the wild sky.” Thomas’s greatest gift to Wales was this flint-eyed rejection of the self-deprecation with which the Welsh are still caricatured, in favour of an austere stoicism. As he writes in Welsh History: “We were a people, and are so yet.When we have finished quarrelling for crumbsUnder the table, or gnawing the bonesOf a dead culture, we will ariseAnd greet each other in a new dawn.” 3. The Small Mine by Menna Gallie (1962)The Welsh Industrial Novel is frequently the Welsh Industrial Accident Novel. The plot of The Small Mine revolves around the death of a young man working in a private colliery in what was, in 1962, an otherwise nationalised industry. With little sentimentality, Gallie examines the effect of the tragedy on the valleys mining community of the fictitious village of Cilhendre, particularly on the lives and rigorously determined roles of the village’s women. Their resilience and survival skills anticipate the response of the support groups formed during the miners’ strike, two decades later. 4. Between Worlds: A Queer Boy from the Valleys by Jeffrey Weeks (2021)The south Wales valleys are also a location in Weeks’ memoir. As a child during the 1950s and 60s, he admires the supportive neighbourliness and tradition of radicalism in his native Rhondda. Weeks is also aware that his sexuality – “a deadly secret” – would inevitably render him an outcast and produce feelings of shame in himself and his family. Like many of his generation, his departure from Wales was facilitated by higher education: “I left the Rhondda just before my 19th birthday … as a queer boy from the Rhondda I had to flee its intense embrace in order to become myself.” By addressing the psychological boundaries placed around close-knit communities, Weeks made it less likely that young people would feel the necessity to leave areas such as the valleys due to their sexuality. 5. The Welsh Extremist by Ned Thomas (1971)Written in English, The Welsh Extremist examines the social energy animating the Cymraeg-speaking areas of Wales during the late 1960s and early 1970s that coalesced into a dynamic and committed protest movement. In 1971, Ned Thomas surveyed “a society that is drained of its own best talent (and) begins to resent every incursion … the land bought for the sake of the trout stream by the fishing syndicate from the Midland city, the buyers of holiday cottages who price the local young couples out.” Half a century later, Wales remains blighted by similar conditions, ill-informed opinions about Cymraeg and ever more powerful market forces. 6. When Was Wales? by Gwyn Alf Williams (1985)In Williams’ memorable phrase, Wales has “survived in crisis”. When Was Wales? detects in the nation a form of amnesia: “Half-memories, folklore … fantasy are rampant. We are a people with plenty of traditions but no historical memory.” Energetic, charismatic and popular, Williams died in 1995 and did not live to witness devolution. Should his doubtless sparkling-eyed ghost attend a Wales football match today, Williams would be greatly enamoured of the bilingual, socially progressive community that constitutes many contemporary Welsh football supporter networks. 7. The Owl Service by Alan Garner (1967)Garner stayed in a holiday home belonging to friends of his wife to research this magical and eerie book for young adults. The Owl Service is a reworking of the last episode of the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi, Math fab Mathonwy, the story of Blodeuwedd – a girl made from flowers, condemned to participate in a love triangle, before undergoing transformation into an owl. Published coincidentally in the psychedelic summer of 1967, The Owl Service is a vivid and hallucinatory story, loyal to its roots among the darkness of Welsh mythology. 8. Sugar and Slate by Charlotte Williams (2002)In this memoir named after the two materials mined by the families of her Guyanese (father) and Welsh-speaking, Gwynedd (mother’s) heritage, Charlotte Williams examines her experience of being Black and Welsh. With great dexterity she also invites the reader to consider several of the received ideas about Wales’s role in colonialism, along with the tendency for Wales to be regarded as one of England’s first colonies. The result is a book that speaks to how a contemporary, multicultural Wales addresses its history. 9. I’r Gad edited by Arwel Vittle (2013)Named after a song by the protest singer and politician Dafydd Iwan, I’r Gad, is a collection of photographs that document the civil disobedience, initiated from the 1960s to the 1990s, to ensure the survival of Cymraeg and lives lived through Cymraeg in Wales. For the non-Welsh speaker, this book is the perfect introduction to the Welsh language movement. Much of the activity it captures was the work of Cymdeithas yr laith Gymraeg (The Welsh Language Society), whose successful campaigns for a Welsh television channel and a Welsh Language Act, among many others, secured and enriched the culture of Wales. 10. The Matter of Wales by Jan Morris (1984)Until her death in 2020, Morris was one of Wales’s greatest literary ambassadors. In this centuries-spanning overview of Welsh history, she is clear-sighted in her analysis – locating recurring faults in the country’s administration and a malevolent energy in the Black Mountains – but it is her boundless love for this small nation that illuminates the text. And Wales loved this generous, remarkable woman in return. Brittle With Relics: A History of Wales 1962-97 by Richard King is published by Faber.

2/23/2022,"Pollo alla cacciatore, or huntsman’s chicken (let us gloss over what kind of hunter comes home with a chicken), is more of a general concept than a specific recipe; as Marcella Hazan explains: “Since there has always been a hunter in nearly every Italian household, every Italian cook prepares a dish with a claim to that description.” Nevertheless, it’s a classic whatever meat you use. Prep 25 minCook 45 minServes 4  Flour, to dustSalt and pepper4 chicken legs, divided into thighs and drumsticks (see step 1)1 knob butter2 tbsp olive oil2 whole garlic heads1 carrot1 stick celery1 small bunch fresh rosemary½ glass white wine (ie, about 75ml)250ml decent chicken stock100g tinned plum tomatoes in juice, roughly chopped (see step 6) Though I like legs, you could use a whole chicken, jointed, or indeed just thighs or drumsticks, if you prefer; be warned, though, that breasts alone are likely to get quite dry. Remove the skin, if you dislike it, though if you’re substituting game bird pieces, which tend towards the lean, I’d suggest leaving it on and potentially adding a little more oil to the pan. Cover a small plate with flour (any sort will do) and season generously. Heat the butter and oil in a large, heavy-based casserole (for which you have a lid) on a medium-high heat. (Alternatively, use a frying pan and transfer the stew to a saucepan in step 7.) Roll the chicken in flour to coat. Fry the chicken in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan, because that will cause the meat to steam rather than fry, until nicely browned all over, then remove from the pan and set aside. While the chicken is cooking, cut the garlic heads in half horizontally and peel and cut the carrot and celery into fairly fine dice. Put the diced vegetables, halved garlic heads (skin and all) and rosemary in the casserole, turn down the heat slightly and fry, stirring regularly, for a few minutes, until beginning to soften and colour; add a little more oil if the veg looks likely to catch and burn. Turn the heat back up a little, pour in the wine, then scrape the bottom of the pan to dislodge any crusty bits of flour. Bring to a simmer, then leave to bubble away until well reduced – there should be only a spoonful or two left. (Note: you can use red wine, vermouth or dry sherry, if you prefer.) Stir in the stock and tomatoes, and bring up to a simmer; if using whole tinned tomatoes, roughly mash them with a fork to break them up a bit. In summer, you could use good, ripe, fresh tomatoes instead, grated on the large holes of a box grater to remove the skins. Put the chicken back in the pan, pushing the pieces down into the sauce. Once the sauce is bubbling away again, cover tightly, turn down the heat and leave to cook quietly for about 45 minutes, or until the meat is falling from the bone. (If using smaller birds, check after 30 minutes.) If the sauce is still fairly liquid once the meat is done – which is likely if you’ve reduced the cooking time to account for smaller game birds – take out the meat, cover to keep warm, then turn up the heat and leave the sauce to bubble away until thickened. Either way, season to taste once you’re happy with the consistency. You may wish to strip the meat off the bones and stir it back into the sauce before serving to small children or the less dextrous, though otherwise I wouldn’t bother. I like this with polenta and a green salad, but mashed potato or buttered rice and steamed vegetables would also be fine accompaniments.

2/23/2022,"Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, the commanders in chief of the Russian air force and Black Sea fleet, leading state “propagandists” and 351 Duma deputies are expected to be targeted in EU sanctions announced later on Wednesday. The measures, which have to be signed off by EU foreign ministers, would go further than those announced by the US and a significant distance beyond Boris Johnson’s Russia sanctions.  If approved, the EU will impose asset freezes and travel bans on 23 people, three banks and a notorious internet “troll factory” in St Petersburg, in response to Russian president Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the self-proclaimed republics in Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. The bloc is also expected to sanction 351 members of the Russian state Duma that voted for recognition of the two territories. The Russian government will also see further restrictions on its ability to raise money on EU financial markets. EU officials are drawing up measures to ban trade between the two Russian-controlled territories in eastern Ukraine, mirroring earlier sanctions on Crimea in 2014. “Everyone seems on board for the adoption of sanctions,” an EU diplomat said. EU capitals have a few hours to send comments, with ministers expected to approve the sanctions at 3pm CET. At the top of the sanctions list is Shoigu, because he is “ultimately responsible for any military action against Ukraine”, states the draft list seen by the Guardian. He is joined by Anton Vaino, Putin’s chief of staff, who “plays an active role in decision making”, as well as Igor Osipov, the commander in chief of the Black Sea Fleet, and Sergei Surovikin, commander in chief of Russian Aerospace Forces. Other top officials include the deputy prime minister and chair of state-owned VTB bank, Dmitry Grigorenko, and Igor Shuvalov, the chair of Russia’s state development bank, VEB, which plays an important role in funding its defence sector. The EU is also targeting Russian “propagandists”, including the foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova and head of the RT channel, Margarita Simonyan, both known for their strident anti-western rhetoric. Vladimir Solovyov, the pro-Kremlin presenter of the Russia One channel, also features. Other notable figures include Yevgeny Prigozhin, described in US sanctions as the founder and unofficial head of the Wagner mercenary group, which is already subject to EU sanctions for its role in sending forces into conflicts in west Africa. Prigozhin, known as Putin’s chef, finances the Internet Research Agency, which has also been added to the EU sanctions list. Based in St Petersburg, the IRA is better known as the “troll factory”, where bloggers work around the clock to flood the global internet with pro-Putin and anti-western views. Prigozhin’s mother and wife, who own companies with links to him, are also on the draft list. The sanctioned banks are Bank Rossiya, believed by EU and western officials to be the personal bank for Putin and many of his officials, as well as Promsvyazbank and Vnesheconombank, both considered by EU officials to be instructed personally by the Russian president, with a key role in financing Russia’s defence sector. EU leaders have signalled further sanctions could follow in the coming days. “Expect some more discussions on the broader big bang sanctions package later this week,” said the EU official.",News/World news,EU poised to announce wide-ranging sanctions on Russia over Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/eu-poised-to-announce-wide-ranging-sanctions-on-russia-over-ukraine
2/23/2022,"Ukraine has advised its estimated 3 million citizens living in Russia to leave the country, in the latest signal that Kyiv believes Moscow may be planning an invasion. In a statement on Wednesday, the Ukrainian foreign ministry urged its citizens to refrain from travel to Russia and for those already in the country to leave as soon as possible.  “Due to the increased Russian aggression against Ukraine, which, among other things, may lead to a significant restriction of the ability to provide consular assistance on the territory of the Russian Federation, the ministry of foreign affairs recommends that Ukrainian citizens refrain from any travel to the Russian Federation, and those who are in this country immediately leave its territory,” the ministry statement said. It also warned that it would have limited resources to help those Ukrainians who remained in Russia in case of a major diplomatic rupture. “We emphasise that ignoring their recommendations will significantly complicate ensuring proper protection of Ukrainian citizens in the Russian Federation,” the note read. Ukrainians make up the largest diaspora community in Russia, where many have family members and travel to work. An estimated 3 million Ukrainian citizens live in Russia, according to a speech Vladimir Putin made in 2019. Separately, the National Security and Defence Council has asked parliament to impose a state of emergency throughout Ukraine, except for Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts – regions that include Russian-controlled territories – where one has already been in place for many years. The council held a long meeting on Tuesday morning, after Russia began moving troops across the border into the separatist-held territories it recognised on Monday, and the US announced that the invasion of Ukraine it had been warning about for weeks had begun. Oleksiy Danilov, the secretary of the council, told journalists after the meeting that the state of emergency allowed the government to bring in controls including restrictions on movement, and curfews. However, curfews are not currently expected to be brought in, and would be imposed only in case of increased Russian aggression, he said. He also confirmed that the country was calling up the first 36,000 military reservists. The country has nearly half a million veterans with frontline experience in the east, so potentially still has a large pool of fighters it could call up. On Wednesday, Putin delivered a video address in connection with the Defender of the Fatherland Day, a national holiday recognising members of the military and on which most Russian men receive presents. In the speech, he praised the battle-readiness of Russia’s military, which has 190,000 soldiers on the borders with Ukraine according to western estimates. “Our country is always open for direct and honest dialogue, for the search for diplomatic solutions to the most complex problems,” Putin said. But he added: “The interests of Russia, the security of our citizens, are non-negotiable for us.” The remarks do little to allay concerns that Russia is preparing itself for a strike against Ukraine. On Tuesday evening, Putin received formal authorisation from the Federation Council to deploy his military abroad and said that he would recognise the land claims of the separatist territories in south-east Ukraine, raising the chances of a war in the near future. He has called for talks between Kyiv and the Russian-controlled territories, negotiations that Ukraine has always called unacceptable because it views them as Russian proxy states. And in another worrying sign, Russia has announced that it will evacuate its diplomats from Ukraine to “protect their lives and safety”. “In the current circumstances, our first priority is to take care of Russian diplomats and employees of the embassy and consulates general,” the foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday evening, saying that it was necessary due to rising tensions. Ukrainian officials have urged western officials to strike hard with sanctions before any Russian attack, believing that would help deter the Kremlin from sending its troops further into Ukraine. “To stop Putin from further aggression, we call on partners to impose more sanctions on Russia now,” wrote the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba. “First decisive steps were taken yesterday, and we are grateful for them. Now the pressure needs to step up to stop Putin. Hit his economy and cronies. Hit more. Hit hard. Hit now.” The EU was expected to approve its sanctions package on Wednesday. The 27-member bloc is approving personal sanctions against top Russian officials, including the Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, and the economy minister, Maxim Reshetnikov. Another government official reportedly on the list is Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. It will also target top Russian state media figures such as RT head Margarita Simonyan and television host Vladimir Solovyov, who has owned property in Italy, according to opposition politician Alexei Navalny.",News/World news,Ukraine urges its citizens to leave Russia immediately,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/23/ukraine-urges-its-citizens-to-leave-russia-immediately
2/23/2022,"Just after last week’s edition of this newsletter went out, Spotify bought two small technology companies. Chartable and Podsights, both founded and headquartered in New York, are hardly household names: with around 50 employees between them, according to estimates from analysts Crunchbase, they’re the sort of acquisitions that large companies make on a regular basis, and often go unnoticed by anyone but industry watchers. But the purchases, both made for undisclosed sums, help explain why the company is so eager to stand firm in the face of criticism from the likes of Neil Young and Joni Mitchell over its broader podcasting strategy – and, specifically, its spending of an estimated $200m on acquiring exclusive rights to the Joe Rogan podcast. First, the acquisitions themselves. The Verge’s Ashley Carman reports:  Both Podsights and Chartable allow podcasters and networks to include tags in their shows that are used to track who listened, if they heard an ad, and whether they took action upon hearing it. Spotify says it plans to use Podsights’ technology outside podcasting and will bring it to the “full scope of the Spotify platform, including audio ads within music, video ads, and display ads.” The Chartable acquisition appears to be more directed toward podcasters themselves rather than advertisers, particularly because of its technology like SmartLinks [which tracks where clicks to podcasts have come from]. “These tools will make it easier for publishers to turn audience insights into action and expand their listenership while ultimately growing their businesses,” Spotify writes. In other words, both companies make tools that turn podcast advertising into something a bit more like web advertising. Podcast adverts are something of a cliche at this point: meal delivery kits, direct-to-consumer mattresses, and web hosting services abound. That’s not (just) because those companies are huge fans of supporting independent media, though. Instead, it’s because buying and running adverts on podcasts has historically been an expensive, analogue affair, that involves one-to-one relationships with a plethora of small publishers and creators, all to publish adverts with little-to-no ability to track anything beyond the absolute broadest metrics possible. That means the “customer acquisition cost” of podcast advertising is extraordinarily high, and so it has typically only paid off for those industries where it’s worth paying a lot of money for each new customer: ones with recurring revenue or big-ticket items. From an advertiser’s point of view, there are inefficiencies throughout the system. Buying adverts is hard, because of the fragmented nature of podcast production; targeting audiences is hard, because of the lack of meaningful analytics available through the decentralised ecosystem; and tracking purchases is hard, because of the difficulty of linking a particular call to action to any individual response. Enter Spotify. What the company is bringing to the table for advertisers is obvious enough. When you listen to a podcast on Spotify, you’re not just downloading an MP3 from a server and playing it on a generic app of your choice – you’re streaming straight from Spotify’s servers, with your listening linked directly to your account and all the commensurate profiling that brings with it. Spotify can sell ads on behalf of podcasters, target those ads in a far more granular way than most podcasting apps, and easily roll out technical features – “tap here to buy”, for instance – as advertisers see fit. But the company faces a chicken-and-egg problem. Audiences won’t switch to listening to podcasts on Spotify without a hefty push, and podcasters won’t switch if the audiences aren’t there. Which is why Spotify is willing to torch its relationships with some of the biggest names in music over Joe Rogan. A lot of musicians accurately described the conflict as one of money, not morals, but missed where the money really lies. Yes, every time you listen to a song on Spotify, you cost the company money: it pays royalties per stream, and the perfect Spotify music fan is someone who pays every month and never opens the app. And yes, every time you listen to Joe Rogan on Spotify, you make the company money: the podcast still has adverts in it, earning payments based on audience size, but Spotify’s deal with the former MMA commentator is reportedly a flat-fee deal. That trade-off is small-fry, though, compared to the long-term point of deals like Rogan’s, which is to turn the platform into the home of podcasts. By buying exclusives upfront, Spotify breaks the chicken-and-egg problem that hampers its efforts to turn podcast advertising from a profitable niche into a core tranche of the industry. The goal isn’t, as the New York Times puts it, to build Spotify into the Netflix of podcasts – it’s to build Spotify into the YouTube of podcasts. And bizarrely, the company is building towards that goal almost unopposed. Apple, whose built-in Podcasts app is still the market leader, has all but abandoned the medium it effectively created. Its desultory launch of paid-for podcasts in late 2021 was notable more for temporarily breaking its own podcast store than it is for the small number of shows that have taken it up on the offer. Amazon is building an impressive roster of audio exclusives at Audible, but its end goal is more clearly a Netflix-style model. And the roster of indie apps and networks that make up the long-tail of the podcasting industry lack the resources and coordination to put up much of a fight. There are exceptions. Spotify’s clear push for market dominance helps explain the BBC’s decision, earlier this month, to pull a number of its podcasts from public directories and make them available exclusively on the BBC Sounds app. “The world of audio listening is constantly changing, and the global tech giants are more routinely publishing content exclusively on their platforms”, the BBC said in a statement. “We want to make sure people can easily find new things from the BBC and can’t rely on other platforms, who have their own exclusive content and a global catalogue to promote, to do this for us.” The move was, and is, controversial. As former Guardian technology editor Charles Arthur put it, “you don’t need a special TV to watch BBC TV; you don’t need a special radio to listen to BBC radio”. And yet there is clearly a level of dominance at which it would be the right call: you don’t need a special TV to watch the BBC, but if the BBC ended up effectively exclusive to Sky through market concentration, something would have gone badly wrong. Regardless of whether Spotify succeeds or fails in its efforts, the push feels like the beginning of the end for one of the last sections of the internet to exist independently of the major technology platforms. Just as the rise of social media usurped blogging, the success of YouTube centralised video creation, and, yes, the creation of Spotify itself upended the MP3-based era of online music fandom, podcasts in their current form feel on the edge of an existential change. It’s hard to see how Spotify’s efforts can be successfully fought except through others, like the BBC, retrenching to their own walled gardens, and while a world with twenty podcasting apps is probably better than a world with just one, it would be the end of an era. From one industry on the cusp of platform assimilation to another in its final throes. This week, Amazon completed its eight-year-long integration of digital comics platform Comixology, which it acquired in the heady days of 2014. By the time the acquisition was finalised, Comixology had already cemented its position as the market leader. A white-label app for Marvel Comics, launched alongside the iPad by Steve Jobs himself, had helped catapult it into the mainstream, and just three years later it boasted a selection that included all the major American publishers, and a wide and growing selection of European and Japanese comics as well. Initially, Amazon seemed content to run Comixology at arms length. Its one prominent intervention was an early salvo in the wars over Apple’s App Store monopoly, when Amazon removed the ability to buy comics in-app in order to avoid the 30% fee charged by the store. Now, though, that has changed. The “new” Comixology has launched, promising full integration with Amazon’s Kindle platform, and it has gone … poorly. The update removed the ability for international users to subscribe to titles (an important feature for a periodical medium), broke every historic link to store pages, cut royalty rates for self-publishers, deleted the ability to download copies of your purchased comics to read on other apps, broke the online comics reader, and replaced a store designed from the ground-up for comic books with a mildly edited version of the main Amazon website. The shift feels existential for digital comics: if Amazon doesn’t fix the glaring oversights rapidly, then consumers will likely turn to piracy, taking the industry right back to the status quo of a decade ago. And yet, the turnover for the entire North American comics industry was just north of $1bn last year – barely a fifth of a per cent of Amazon’s revenue for the same period. For digital comics creators, the day Comixology was shut down could be the most consequential moment of their careers; for Amazon, it was just Thursday.

2/23/2022,"A kennel struck by a meteorite, a hunk of Mars and other examples of the “oldest matter humankind can touch” are expected to be sold for millions of pounds, as Christie’s holds its annual sale of rare and unusual meteorites. Included in the 66 lots on “Deep Impact: Martian, Lunar and other Rare Meteorites” is a dog house hit by a meteorite which crashed through the tin roof in April 2019 in Aguas Zarcas, Costa Rica. Expected to sell for as much as £220,000, it has a seven-inch hole which “marks where the meteorite punctured the roof”, according to the catalogue.  Its resident, a German shepherd named Roky, survived unharmed, according to James Hyslop, head of the science and natural history department at Christie’s. “To value all the items in the auction, I work to the four Ss – size, shape, science and story,” he told the BBC. “The story and its provenance play a very important role in determining the value. My first question when I was offered the dog shed for auction was, ‘Was Roky OK?’ I’m pleased to report that other than now being ‘sans’ dog shed, he’s doing just fine.” The auction house is also expecting keen interest in a 15g fragment of the meteorite that fell over the Cotswold town of Winchcombe last year, which could sell for up to £50,000 – more than 70 times the value of its weight in gold and become of the largest pieces ever to be held in private hands. The item on sale is just a fragment of the Winchcombe meteorite – the most important meteorite ever to be recovered in the UK – more than 90% of its remnants is now housed in the UK’s national collection, curated by London’s Natural History Museum. Other items include “rocks that have been jettisoned by larger meteorite impacts on the moon or on Mars”, the astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson told Reuters. “These rocks escaped, those bodies wandered through space, some of which landed here on Earth.” He added: “You might go your whole life without ever touching a meteorite, but there are people who have devoted their entire careers to finding them in the wild, and they often go up for sale either to merchants or at an auction. So, if you want a piece of the universe other than Earth, they’re available to you.” A further lot includes more than 100 tiny shards from a meteoroid that exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk in 2013, causing a dazzling light display streak of light as the 20-metre-wide space rock hurtled into the skies over the city and began to tear apart at an altitude of 28 miles. The highest price is expected to go to the third largest Mars rock to land on Earth.
