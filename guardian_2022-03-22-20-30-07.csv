3/22/2022,"Ukraine’s government has beseeched Vladimir Putin to let civilians leave the devastated city of Mariupol as a convoy of 21 buses carrying 1,114 evacuees set off on a tense escape through territory occupied by Russian forces. The convoy of mainly women and children, escorted by Ukraine’s emergency services, faces a 125-mile journey northwest from Berdyansk, a village on the outskirts of Mariupol, to the city of Zaporizhzhia. The city council in Mariupol said in a statement that Russian forces had “destroyed almost 80% of the city’s infrastructure in 22 days, of which 30% can no longer be rebuilt”. The fate of those inside an art school flattened on Sunday and a theatre targeted four days earlier remains unclear. “Mariupol residents are in terrible conditions and are overcoming new challenges every day,” the city council said. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, appealed to Russia to allow humanitarian supplies into the city and to let civilians leave. “We demand the opening of a humanitarian corridor for civilians,” she said. The local authorities in Zaporizhzhia said they were preparing to receive the evacuated families with “food, medical and psychological support, as well as resettlement assistance”. Between 100,000 and 200,000 people remain trapped in Mariupol where people have been living in dire conditions without water, electricity and heating for weeks. Ukraine’s government has defied an ultimatum by the Russian military for its forces to “lay down arms” by 5am Moscow time (2am GMT) on Monday in return for humanitarian relief. Lyudmila Denisova, Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman, said that on Monday Russian forces had fired on evacuation buses from Mariupol, a strategically important target for President Putin, and that four children had been taken to hospital. She said that as of 8am BST on Tuesday, 117 children had died in the war and more than 155 children had been injured. “It is impossible to establish the actual number of dead and wounded children due to the fact that the occupying forces are actively fighting in Ukrainian cities,” Denisova added. “In the Kharkiv region, a Russian tank shot down a car with a family of two children. The family shouted that they were civilians, waving a white flag, but in vain. Parents and a nine-year-old girl were killed and a 17-year-old boy was injured. “As a result of attack of the village of Konstantinovka of the Nikolaev area houses were destroyed, under their blockages the burnt bodies of three people, among which the seven-year-old child are found. On March 21, 2022, the occupiers fired on evacuation buses with children from Mariupol. Four children were taken to hospital.” The Russian government denies shelling civilians. Mariupol is seen as key to securing a Russian corridor between the separatist Donbas region and illegally annexed Crimea. It is also home to the largest trading port in the Azov Sea from which Ukraine exports grain, iron and steel, and heavy machinery. A Ukrainian MP, Anton Gerashchenko, claimed that the siege of the city was being led by Col Gen Mikhail Mizintsev, a favourite of Putin, who was said to be responsible for Russian operations in Syria. Mizintsev has been the head of the National Center for Defense Management of the Russian Federation since December 2014 and has held the post of Col Gen since 2017. The Ukrainian military claimed on Tuesday that Russian forces have stockpiles of ammunition and food that will last for “no more than three days”. Officials said the situation was similar with fuel. It also claimed that about 300 Russia servicemen refused to carry out orders in the Okhtyrka district of the Sumy region. The claims have not been independently verified. On Monday night, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy again urged direct talks with Putin, saying: “Without this meeting it is impossible to fully understand what they are ready for in order to stop the war.” He also said his country will never bow to ultimatums from Russia and cities directly under attack, including the capital, Kyiv, and Mariupol and Kharkiv would not accept Russian occupation.",News/World news,Ukraine begs Putin to let civilians escape ruins of Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/22/ukraine-begs-putin-civilians-escape-ruins-mariupol-russia
3/22/2022,"Maybe you had to be there. There is something extravagant and irresistible about the idea of an old-fashioned cultural evening of musical and spoken-word performance. Hollywood legend Bill Murray does the droll literary readings and occasionally some awful singing, and he’s joined musically by his friends: cellist Jan Vogler and violinist Mira Wang (married to Vogler), with Vanessa Perez on the piano. James Fenimore Cooper, Hemingway and James Thurber are among those being read and Gershwin and Schubert among those performed. This is the filmed record of the final night of this show’s world tour on the Acropolis stage in Athens: their curated performance being a sprightly, tongue-in-cheek homage to civilisation itself. It’s an elegant, eccentric evening in many ways and maybe only Murray’s participation could have made it happen or sold tickets. To me, the audio mix sounded off, so that Murray’s vocals were often all but inaudible against the accompaniment, but maybe it sounded just fine live. His singing, especially in the stirring Scottish ballads, is heartfelt, though probably best heard with a glass or two of malt under your belt. Occasionally we were close to Florence Foster Jenkins territory – that is, the high-society warbler portrayed by Meryl Streep. But the moment where Murray steps downstage to tango with Wang is startling, and rather stylish on the part of both dancers. The best touch comes after Murray has performed a lengthy reading from Cooper and then admits that the audience may be bored and wondering if it’s not too late to duck out and get some moussaka. To be honest, that moussaka feeling is never that far away. The uniqueness of the event staves off the hunger pangs.  New Worlds: The Cradle of Civilisation is released on 22 March in cinemas.",Arts/Film,"New Worlds: The Cradle of Civilization review – Bill Murray’s elegant, eccentric concert film",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/22/new-worlds-the-cradle-of-civilization-review-bill-murrays-elegant-eccentric-concert-film
3/22/2022,"As strange hands searched her body and pulled back her hair to check if it was a wig, Judis looked at the faces of the Ukrainian border guards and felt fear and despair. “Ukrainian border guards undress you and touch you everywhere,” Judis says. “You can see on their faces they’re wondering ‘what are you?’ like you’re some kind of animal or something.” Judis is a transgender woman whose birth certificate defines her as female. Legally, there is no reason why she should not be allowed to pass with the thousands of women who are crossing Ukrainian borders to safety every day. Yet, on 12 March at about 4am, after a long and humiliating search, border guards determined she was a man and prevented her passage into Poland. When Ukraine imposed martial law on 24 February, all men aged between 18 and 60 were banned from leaving the country. Since then, it is estimated that hundreds of Ukrainian trans people have attempted to cross the border. The Guardian has been told by activists and aid workers that, despite their legal status as women, dozens have been mistreated and pushed back at the borders, with many fearing for their lives in the event that Russia’s transphobic regime takes over. According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, Ukraine ranks 39th out of 49 European countries for its overall treatment of LGBTQ+ people. Gay marriage is not allowed in the country, the Christian Orthodox Church considers homosexuality a sin and there are no anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTQ+ people. Since 2017, trans people in Ukraine have been legally recognised, but must undergo extensive psychiatric observation and a lengthy bureaucratic process before their gender can be reflected on formal documents. Caught up in this complex process, thousands of Ukrainian trans people had no personal identity document or certificate when war broke out. “Martial law says all males are obliged to serve in the military, so they can’t leave the country,” says Olena Shevchenko, 39, a human rights defender and the chair of Insight, a Ukrainian LGBTQ+ organisation and one of the few public organisations in the country that works with trans people. “Technically, the law applies to trans people as well, including both certified trans men and trans women who had not changed their documents. But it sounds like Ukrainian border guards are preventing even trans people with a valid certificate reflecting their new gender from leaving Ukraine, and nobody knows why.” Judis is from Svatove, in the Luhansk region, which is controlled by Moscow-backed separatists; she fled to Kyiv before Russian forces took her home town. “As soon as I arrived in a village near the capital, my grandma’s house in Svatove was destroyed by a missile,” she says. “[After I left] I had no money and lived in a basement in a village on the outskirts of Kyiv. One day, a rocket hit about 150 metres from the house I was living in. Since then, I have had nightmares about how my limbs were blown off by a bomb.” In their haste to leave bombed villages, thousands of Ukrainians did not stop to gather up documents such as passports, or had never applied for one before. Recognising this difficulty and the urgent need to help people travel to safety once the Russian shelling began, the Ukrainian government instructed officials to recognise any ID certificate or document – original or photocopy – at borders. But as soon as Judis arrived at the border crossing last week, two guards stopped her and asked her to follow them to a room beside the customs office, where they physically examined her. “Afterwards, one of the guards said, ‘you’re a guy, so get the hell out of here’, and told me I should be grateful they didn’t call the police, even though I have a legally valid document that states I am female. “‘Go to the war’, they replied, adding that more than 3 million people had already fled the country and they weren’t going to let me out.” Alice, 24, a trans woman from Brovary, a town near Kyiv, recounted a similar experience. She and her wife, Helen, a 21-year-old who identifies as non-binary, were stopped by border guards during an attempt to cross into Poland. “They took us to a building near the border crossing,” recounts Alice. “There were three officers in the room. They told us to take off our jackets. They checked our hands, arms, checked my neck to see if I had an Adam’s apple. They touched my breasts. After examining us, border guards told us we were men. We tried to explain our situation but they didn’t care.” LGBTQ+ associations and human rights defenders are warning that, since the beginning of the invasion, trans people are running out of hormones because of pharmacy closures and lack of medicines across the country. “If you stop taking hormones suddenly, it is extremely harmful to your health,” says Alice. Rain Dove Dubilewski and Bernard Vaernes work for Safebow, an organisation helping to evacuate vulnerable people to safety. They were with Alice and Judis when they attempted to cross into Poland. “This is the moment where we need to show that there are people suffering, not only from the war, but because of sexism and transphobia, and yet [those at risk] cannot leave,” says Vaernes. Vaernes says that Russia’s discriminatory and hostile approach to LGBTQ+ rights is terrifying Ukraine’s trans community. In 2013, a “gay propaganda” law was introduced in Russia, making it illegal to promote gay rights. President Vladimir Putin has described gender fluidity as “a crime against humanity”. “All the trans people I have talked to in Ukraine are afraid of Russia,’’ Vaernes says. A few days before the invasion, US ambassador to the UN, Bathsheba Nell Crocker, warned in a letter of Russia’s plan to continue human rights abuses in the parts of Ukraine it already occupies. “These acts (killings, kidnappings/forced disappearances, unjust detentions and the use of torture) would likely target those who oppose Russian actions, including vulnerable populations such as religious and ethnic minorities and LGBTQI+ persons,” Crocker wrote. Soon after war broke out, the UN urged Ukraine to take a “compassionate and humane” approach to the enforcement of martial law after multiple reports of Ukrainian men defying orders to stay and attempting to flee into neighbouring countries. “I want to be free to do what I want in life,” says Judis. “I will try again to cross the border because it’s my right to leave and to live. And I will not remain silent. I will not be held prisoner.”",News/Global development,‘I will not be held prisoner’: the trans women turned back at Ukraine’s borders,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/22/i-will-not-be-held-prisoner-the-trans-women-turned-back-at-ukraines-borders
3/22/2022,"“Catfishing” sounds like an exciting hobby, but language can sometimes conceal the insidious nature of abuse. Perpetrators reel in victims by deceiving and manipulating them, pretending to be someone else and preying on their vulnerabilities to create emotional dependency. Then, when they have been duped into a relationship, they extract something from them – money or emotional pain. At least one in five people surveyed by BetMinded last year said they have been the victim of catfishing Financial gain is often the driving force behind online dating scams. In the first quarter of 2021, romance fraud cost UK dating app users more than £73.9m according to Action Fraud, with online dating scams up a staggering 40% since the pandemic. A man was jailed for 12 months for lying about his identity and scamming two women out of out of more than £345,000. However, money isn’t always the driving force behind catfishing. Sometimes these relationships are predicated on power and control. This is where UK law falls short. These are incidents of grooming and coercive control and should be seen through the lens of intimate partner violence. The state doesn’t prosecute catfishers for lying about who they are (their name, marital status, profession, address and so on) or for the untold amounts of psychological suffering caused. Police are certainly not equipped to deal with sophisticated catfishers and vulnerable victims. People who have fallen prey to catfishers have little to no recourse to seek justice. This was seen very clearly in the podcast Sweet Bobby in which Kirat Assi described her relationship with the titular man, a charismatic doctor whom she spent hours speaking with each day (albeit they never met in person). But Bobby was not who he said he was – he was in fact Assi’s female cousin, Simran Bhogal, who had stolen the identity of the real Bobby. The purpose of this catfishing was not to extract money from Assi, but seemingly to make her believe she was in an authentic, romantic relationship. But why? Assi described being controlled by Bobby as he monitored her movements and dictated her everyday life choices. She described the relationship as having a profound effect on her mental and physical health. If this had of been a straightforward case of two authentic people in a relationship it would surely have screamed coercive control, which has been a criminal offence since 2015. Coercive behaviour is a pattern of acts to threaten, humiliate, intimidate, harm and punish a victim. Controlling behaviour means a pattern of behaviour to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from their support network and exploiting their capacities for personal gain. So why is catfishing treated any differently when most cases have the same elements of control and abuse as in relationships between two “real” people? In this case, Bhogal deprived Assi of the means needed for independence, regulated her everyday behaviour to the extent that she was isolated, and trapped her in a make-believe relationship. However, the police said no crime had been committed. The police were locked into traditional ideas of abuse only being present in offline relationships between authentic partners rather than recognising that online relationships through catfishing can also constitute coercive control. In another case, Anna Rowe met a man on Tinder and after a 14-month relationship she discovered his profile was fake and he was married. In a petition signed by over 50,000 people calling for catfishing to be criminalised, she said that the perpetrator “took advantage of my trust and took away my right to choose. Had I known, I would never have consented to a sexual relationship”. This is a powerful statement. The consequences of catfishing are so devastating that he took away her right to consent to sex. Assi did not give up on pursuit of justice. She reached a settlement in a civil case against Bhogal for harassment, misuse of private information and data protection breaches. But it should never have been left to a victim of abuse to pursue her perpetrator in the civil courts. There is a duty on the state to hold perpetrators accountable for their abuse. Because of the state’s failure to criminalise catfishing, Assi had no choice but to embark on costly and time-consuming litigation without the same guarantees of anonymity as in the criminal courts, just to get a semblance of justice. But is money or a private, perfectly scripted apology really justice when the perpetrator carries on without a criminal record? Even when victims claim financial payouts, they don’t always receive the money owed to them. I represented a woman who had been deceived and manipulated by a charming man online who scammed her out of her life savings; she was left financially destitute. While she won her claim in the civil courts, recouping her money was always going to be a losing battle because he claimed not to have a penny to his name. People’s motivations for catfishing vary, but they have one thing in common – they cause victims irreparable emotional harm. Catfishing must become a specific criminal offence. Perpetrators need to be brought to justice for their deception, lies, manipulation and abuse that ruins people’s lives. It would send out a strong message to victims that the law will protect them and to perpetrators that they will be held accountable. But first, let’s start by calling it exactly what it is – control and exploitation, not catfishing.

3/22/2022,"Its original broadcast was postponed by a nervous Channel 4, it led to questions in the House of Commons and to a (Labour) culture secretary professing herself “shocked and appalled” on the 10 O’Clock News. It is also “one of the greatest comedies ever shown on television,” says David Walliams, who on Sunday night hosted a screening of a film about the making of Chris Morris’s legendary series Brass Eye – 25 years old this year. Oxide Ghosts: The Brass Eye Tapes splices together off-cuts and outtakes from the show, and is made by Brass Eye’s director, Michael Cumming, who excavated the material from his own chest of floppy discs and VHS tapes. It’s touring now, and for Brass Eye fans – that’s me! – it’s a must-see. Why? Because it reveals the broadcast series – six short episodes only, plus the notorious “Paedogeddon” special – as just the tip of an iceberg of astonishing material. Scenes such as the West End musical about Peter Sutcliffe and the footage of Morris with a spacehopper on his head scoring made-up drugs on a street corner were often prime cuts of much longer sequences, shown here. Then there are whole unseen items, every bit as harsh/funny as the broadcast material – like the “Lady Parliament” sketch, in which Morris convenes an all-female panel to adjudicate on animal cruelty, then bamboozles and patronises the panel to a hasty conclusion. But you can also enjoy Oxide Ghosts for a peep behind the veil that tends to conceal the show’s reclusive star. There are flashes of how he persuaded his celebrity stooges to appear on the programme – or failed to, in the case of Jeffrey Archer. A sense arises of the risks to which its creators were exposed when making the show, as Morris fashions an impromptu stab-proof vest from a Vogue magazine, and as Reggie Kray commissions a heavy to visit the production office after Morris pranked him on a phone call to Maidstone jail. Then there’s the corpsing, which can’t help but humanise an artist whose human side is more zealously guarded than the crown jewels. Here, Morris giggles at the list of animals he’s improvising while in character as a livestock supplier to British MPs. He giggles when an elephant pisses over his studio floor. And he breaks his daytime TV presenter character to giggle at one of the sickliest moments of the series, when he’s interviewing a fictional teenage girl who has been sexually abused by her uncle. “Was he,” asks Morris, unctuous concern and self-regard vying for the spotlight, “as handsome as me?” Oof. But then there are so many “oof” moments – when you can’t believe Morris’s rent-a-quote celebs are actually speaking the nonsense he feeds them; or moments of cruelty or obscenity that you marvel Morris got away with, even (or perhaps especially) when viewed at 25 years’ distance. We’re more delicate now than in the 90s – this is not a series made for the era of self-care and the safe space. In a post-screening conversation with Walliams, Cumming discusses the scenes Morris might not venture were the show made today. A sketch about a Holocaust board game was mentioned – although it ended up on the cutting-room floor anyway. The series’ rape jokes and conspicuous interest in gay sex feel ickier to me a quarter century on. Then there’s the subliminal single-frame expletive directed at Channel 4’s then chief exec, the telly grandee Michael Grade – which Cumming apologises for tonight, because Grade, he admits, was bolder in programming and defending the show than they gave him credit for. But Brass Eye’s brutality is the point: it’s a bonfire of proprieties. (Cumming cited Pete ’n’ Dud’s Derek and Clive albums as an influence.) You take it in that spirit, or not at all. Its genius – alongside the rampant silliness, the Edward Lear-like linguistic flamboyance, the great performances – is to be in appalling taste on the one hand, and driven by a palpable moral scorn on the other. Scorn at the pompous inanities of the infotainment culture that was still dawning in 1997, when social media was but a twinkle in Mark Zuckerberg’s eye. Scorn at the cult of celebrity that suggests no charitable cause is worthwhile unless fronted by a C-list personality. (One of the pleasures of rewatching Brass Eye is to be reminded how swiftly such people – your Tamara Beckwiths, your Caesar the Geezers – return to obscurity.) Inevitably, Cumming’s Q&A tended towards the question: could Brass Eye happen today? Its director doubts it: the internet has changed everything, including the likelihood (give or take the work of Sacha Baron Cohen, Brass Eye’s most obvious inheritor) that a show this audacious could ever premiere directly on network TV. It’s also a show of its time, when perspective was still possible on the interplay of media and celebrity or the flattening effect of rolling news. Nowadays, that’s just the air we breathe. Brass Eye takes a torch to it all, and to whatever bridges still connected Morris to a career in TV comedy. Artists that wild don’t come along often – and when they do, they’re seldom given their own TV show. It happened, once – and Oxide Ghosts gives us a great chance to celebrate it.

3/22/2022,"Post office operators who helped uncover the Horizon IT scandal will be able to apply to a new compensation scheme, the chancellor has announced. The IT system installed by the Post Office and supplied by Fujitsu falsely suggested there were cash shortfalls, leading to 736 unsafe convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting in one of the biggest miscarriages of justice in British legal history. On Tuesday, Rishi Sunak said a compensation scheme would be set up in the coming months targeted at the workers who brought and won the landmark high court case against the Post Office over the failings. The 2019 ruling paved the way for millions of pounds of future payouts and led to the court of appeal quashing the convictions of workers who were wrongly accused of committing crimes. Despite winning nearly £43m in compensation in 2019, the group was left financially disadvantaged after having to pay significant legal costs based on a “no win, no fee” agreement with Therium – the company that funded its litigation. Due to the terms of their legal agreement each operator received a fraction of the settlement, equating to about £20,000 each. Their action meant they were ineligible to apply to the Historical Shortfall Scheme (HSS) which was set up to by the Post Office after the scandal to compensate workers who had to personally cover shortfalls in their branch’s accounts caused by the Horizon IT. The new scheme will ensure that those who uncovered the injustice receive the same level of compensation as those who claimed through the HSS, the government said. Sunak said: “The Horizon IT dispute has had a devastating impact on postmasters and their families, with many losing their livelihoods or being wrongly convicted for crimes they didn’t commit. “Without the efforts of these postmasters, this terrible injustice may have never been uncovered so it is only right that they are compensated fully and fairly. “That is why we have set up this new compensation scheme for those who played a crucial role bringing this scandal to light, which I hope provides a measure of comfort. The scheme comes after the government announced a separate scheme last year to provide funding for full and final settlements for eligible post office operators who have had their Horizon-related conviction overturned, with those eligible to receive an interim payment of up to £100,000 each. The Treasury said more details of the new scheme, including how people can submit compensation claims, will be set out by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy in due course.",News/Business,Post Office IT scandal: compensation scheme launched for victims,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/compensation-scheme-launched-post-office-horizon-it-scandal
3/22/2022,"The owner of B&Q and Screwfix is handing workers a pay rise as the company’s boss forecast that demand for energy-saving kit and the shift to working from home would keep fuelling the DIY boom. Pay for B&Q workers will increase by 6.5% to £9.80 an hour while Screwfix is increasing minimum staff pay by 5.4% to £9.70 an hour from 1 April, putting both chains just ahead of the new legal minimum of £9.50 which starts next month. Their parent company, Kingfisher, is the latest retail company to announce a significant pay rise for workers, amid heavy competition for staff, the increase in the legal minimum wage and a strong rise in sales and profits. The retailer announced pretax profit of £1bn for the first time in the year to 31 January – a third up on the previous year and a threshold passed by only a handful of UK retailers ever – as sales rose almost 7% to £13.2bn, fuelled by a burst of home improvement during pandemic lockdowns. Families refitted spare rooms as offices or space for adult children and refurbished gardens for outdoor entertaining to reduce their Covid risk. Thierry Garnier, the Kingfisher chief executive, said he expected the DIY boom to roll on amid “strong supportive trends” including more working from home, a relatively strong housing market and “a lot of demand for energy saving” because of higher gas and fuel prices. “Home improvement is not a bad place to be in a crisis,” he said, saying that trading since the year end had been resilient with sales up 16% on pre-pandemic levels with strong orders for kitchen makeovers. He added that he hoped the government would put forward new plans to help support families to install more energy efficiency measures to offset higher gas and electricity bills caused by a global surge in energy prices. “UK homes are relatively poorly insulated,” he said. B&Q is to test out a service that will “diagnose and fit energy efficiency solutions”, such as insulation and heating management tools, to cater to demand, while Screwfix is selling solar panels and heat pumps. The group is opening 80 more Screwfix outlets over the coming year, up from 70 over the past year, with the aim of reaching a total of 1,000, up from about 790 at present. It is also experimenting with franchise outlets in the Middle East and expanding an online DIY marketplace, which will enable brands to sell direct to B&Q customers. However, Kingfisher said it would be cutting costs by trimming the size of 40 stores in the UK and France by up to 30% over the coming decade, including four B&Q stores this year, and by installing more self-checkouts and self-scanning systems. Despite the pay rise, the group’s hourly pay rates sit below those of many rival retailers including Aldi, Lidl, Marks & Spencer & Sainsbury’s. Garnier warned that inflation would continue to dog the market throughout 2022 with a constant challenge from the cost and availability of shipping containers, while suppliers were struggling to keep pace with demand for garden products and building materials. Despite the problems, Garnier said availability of products was now at about normal levels ahead of the busy Easter season and about half the group’s products were now own-label, offering a cheaper alternative to well-known brands. The group has removed some Russian-made products from its shelves but had no direct impact from the war in Ukraine after selling its Castorama chain there in 2020. Garnier said Kingfisher’s businesses in Poland and Romania continued to trade strongly despite the war in their eastern neighbour.",News/Business,B&Q and Screwfix staff to get pay rise as DIY boom continues,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/22/bq-screwfix-staff-pay-rise-diy-kingfisher
