1/31/2022,"Donald Trump said Saturday if he was reelected, he'd consider pardons for January 6 defendants. Sen. Lindsey Graham said Sunday it was ""inappropriate"" and could embolden other violent groups. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said Graham ""pretends to be a friend to President Trump."" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Sunday harshly criticized Sen. Lindsey Graham after he called the former President Donald Trump's comments about Capitol riot defendants ""inappropriate."" At a rally in Texas on Saturday, Trump said he would consider pardons for people who were charged in the January 6 attack on the Capitol if he decides to run and wins in 2024. ""We will treat them fairly,"" he said. ""And if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons."" So far 761 people have been charged in the Capitol riot, with counts that include entering restricted grounds, disorderly conduct, and assaulting police officers, among others. During an appearance Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation, Graham was asked about the comments and called them ""inappropriate."" ""I don't want to send any signal that it was OK to defile the Capitol,"" the South Carolina Republican said, adding: ""There are other groups with causes that may want to go down the violent path if these people get pardoned."" Graham has consistently called for the prosecution of people who attacked the Capitol during the insurrection. Greene, Republican from Georgia and staunch supporter of Trump, blasted Graham in a long post on her Gab account, airing a list of grievances. ""Lindsey Graham has done nothing about J6,"" Greene began. She has previously visited Capitol riot defendants in jail and has complained about their living conditions. In her post, she accused Graham of doing nothing for them. ""Instead of actually doing something about the great injustice happening to pretrial Americans awaiting their day in court, Lindsey Graham turns his head to their abuse, votes for Joe Biden's nominees, votes for Joe Biden's Infrastructure bill, and then pretends to be a friend to President Trump,"" she wrote.

""Aren't we all sick and tired of those kind of 'friends,'"" she added. Representatives for Graham and Greene did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

1/31/2022,"By Fabian Cambero SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean protesters marched against immigration and crime in the Andean country's far north on Sunday, with some violent factions destroying belongings from migrant camps in the streets amid growing tension in the region over border controls. Photos showed protesters, many carrying Chilean flags, breaking up tent structures and bedding in the northern city of Iquique and putting it into a big pile, an echo of angry protests in September last year when camps were burned. Despite pandemic restrictions in recent years, many migrants from Venezuela and elsewhere have kept trying to reach Chile, one of the wealthiest countries in the region, which has been rocked in recent years by protests over entrenched inequality. ""This can't go on,"" read one protest banner from Sunday's march in the coastal city by several thousand people, who were complaining about what they called a spike in illegal immigration and an increase in crime. Local media reported that a group of protesters had attacked one migrant man. Videos on social networks showed the man lying on the ground surrounded by police officers while protesters, waving Chilean flags and holding saucepans, shouted at him. The call to protest came after a group of Venezuelan migrants recently attacked police officers at a checkpoint, for which they were detained. Protesters on social media also called for strike action in the city over the situation. Migration and crime were a big voter concern in presidential elections late last year, which were won by Gabriel Boric, 35, a leftist lawmaker and former student protest leader who comes into office in March.
