2/18/2022,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California became the first state to formally shift to an “endemic” approach to the coronavirus with Gov. Gavin Newsom's announcement Thursday of a plan that emphasizes prevention and quick reaction to outbreaks over mandated masking and business shutdowns. The milestone, nearly two years in the making, envisions a return to a more normal existence with the help of a variety of initiatives and billions in new spending to more quickly spot surges or variants, add health care workers, stockpile tests and push back against false claims and other misinformation. “We are moving past the crisis phase into a phase where we will work to live with this virus,"" he said during a news conference from a state warehouse brimming with pandemic supplies in Fontana, east of Los Angeles. The first-term Democrat, who last year survived a recall election driven by critics of his governance during the pandemic, promised the state's nearly 40 million residents that as the omicron surge fades, “we’re going to keep them safe and we’re going to stay on top of this."" A disease reaches the endemic stage when the virus still exists in a community but becomes manageable as immunity builds. But there will be no definitive turn of the switch, the Democratic governor said, unlike the case with Wednesday’s lifting of the state’s indoor masking requirements or an announcement coming Feb. 28 of when precisely schoolchildren can stop wearing face coverings. And there will be no immediate lifting of the dozens of remaining executive emergency orders that have helped run the state since Newsom imposed the nation’s first statewide stay-home order in March 2020. “This pandemic won’t have a defined end. There’s no finish line,” Newsom said. The World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and with omicron fading in many parts of the world some countries have begun planning for the endemic stage. But no state has taken the step Newsom did and offered a detailed forward-looking plan. Republicans have been frequent critics of Newsom's handling of the coronavirus and were quick to disparage his latest effort. State GOP Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson called it “an extra-large helping of word salad"" and renewed the call to “follow the lead of other blue states and end his state of emergency or lift his school mask mandate."" Newsom's plan sets specific goals, such as stockpiling 75 million masks, establishing the infrastructure to provide up to 200,000 vaccinations and 500,000 tests a day in the event of an outbreak, and adding 3,000 medical workers within three weeks in surge areas. Newsom’s administration came up with a shorthand acronym to capsulize key elements of its new approach: SMARTER. The letters stand for Shots, Masks, Awareness, Readiness, Testing, Education and Rx, a reference to improving treatments for COVID-19. Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, an epidemiologist at the University of Southern California, said while some may argue these should have come sooner, he believes “the timing is right on."" “Surveillance, testing, vaccination and treatment make the context very different and make it appropriate to shift our response from a pandemic response of trying to do everything possible, to a more rational response to try to implement things that we have strong evidence that work,” Klausner said. The plan includes increased monitoring of virus remnants in wastewater to watch for the first signs of a surge. Masks won't be required but will be encouraged in many settings. If a higher level of the virus is detected, health officials will determine if it is a new variant. If so, state and federal officials have a goal to within 30 days determine if it responds to existing tests, treatments and immunities from vaccines or prior infections. California’s health secretary, Dr. Mark Ghaly, said one of the goals is to avoid business closures and other far-reaching mandates. However, he said the state's requirement that schoolchildren be vaccinated against coronavirus by fall remains in effect. The plan includes new education, including “myth-buster videos” to fight misinformation and disinformation and help interpret ever-evolving precautions for a confused public whiplashed by safeguards that seemingly shift by the day and vary across county lines. In coordination with the federal government, it calls for a first-in-the-nation study of the pandemic’s direct and indirect impacts long-term on both people and communities. All this will cost billions, much of it already outlined in the pandemic response package Newsom sought as part of his budget last month. That includes $1.9 million that  lawmakers already approved  to boost staffing at hospitals and increase coronavirus testing and vaccine distribution, as well as existing money and anticipated federal funds. His proposed budget also includes $1.7 billion to beef up the state’s health care workforce, with more investment in increased laboratory testing capacity, data collection and outbreak investigation. Newsom, who has faced criticism for sometimes failing to follow his own rules,  defended keeping in place some of his executive emergency orders, which he said most recently have allowed the state to quickly bring in temporary medical workers and to quickly distribute more than 13 million home test kits to schools. Those orders have dwindled from 561 to fewer than 100 in recent months, he said, and his administration is working with legislative leaders to eventually make them unnecessary.",Health/Associated Press,California adopts nation's 1st 'endemic' virus policy,https://news.yahoo.com/california-adopts-nations-first-endemic-050706315.html
2/18/2022,"By Darya Korsunskaya and Andrey Ostroukh MOSCOW (Reuters) -Possible western sanctions against Russian banks will lead to a spike in market volatility but Russia will be able to withstand restrictions thanks to abundant reserves, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday. U.S. and European officials are finalising an extensive package of penalties should Russia invade Ukraine. Moscow has repeatedly denied it has such a plan. Such sanctions could target major Russian banks and its energy sector but will not include banning Russia from the SWIFT financial system, according to U.S. and European officials. Siluanov said sanctions against Russian banks would be ""unpleasant"" but the state will make sure that all deposits with banks, all transactions, including in foreign currencies, are secured. ""Thank god we have enough forex liquidity and enough forex reserves,"" Siluanov told reporters. ""They say we have a financial shield in the form of gold and forex reserves, budget surplus and [budget] rule, low debt."" If new sanctions target Russian energy companies, Russia would be ready to re-route its supplies to other markets, Siluanov said. Russia has been living under financial and economic sanctions since 2014 when the West attempted to punish it for annexing Crimea and for its role in the military conflict in Ukraine. Restrictions prompted banks and companies to reduce dependence on global debt markets, while Russia focused on replenishing reserves and developing its own financial systems as alternative to SWIFT or Visa and MasterCard. Siluanov said Russia will be able to switch to other financial systems if it is cut off from SWIFT. ""We expect the country's financial system to continue to focus inwards as part of the ""Fortress Russia"" strategy and advance digital and fintech sovereignty,"" the Institute of International Finance. Siluanov said possible restrictions on buying of Russian debt would be ""unpleasant but not fatal"" for Russia, which had nearly $635 billion in gold and forex reserves as of early February. The minister said Russia had no plans to revise its 2022 borrowing plan worth 3.3 trillion roubles ($44 billion), preferring to raise funds via OFZ bonds with fixed coupons, while also offering bonds with floating-rate coupons. Once the current situation calms down, Russia will consider testing foreign demand for Russian Eurobonds, Siluanov said.

2/18/2022,"Getty Images Several months after revealing she'd been left ""permanently deformed"" by a fat-freezing procedure called CoolSculpting, model Linda Evangelista is opening up further about the physical and emotional pain she's endured since her initial session back in August 2015. In a new interview with People, Evangelista is sharing photos of the rare — but serious — side effect she says she experienced as a direct result of CoolSculpting, stating that she can no longer live in ""hiding and shame"" after five years of retreating from the public eye. While minimally-invasive, ""lunch break"" cosmetic treatments have been on the rise, no doubt in large part due to social media and decreased stigma surrounding treatments in recent years, they aren't without risk, as Evangelista is now highlighting. Along with sharing photos of her affected areas, the model is revealing exactly what happened after a series of seven CoolSculpting sessions from her dermatologist between August 2015 and February 2016. Within three months of her treatments, Evangelista says she noticed bulges at her chin, thighs, and bra area that began to harden and numb completely, reports People. She stopped eating and increased exercising, believing she ""was doing something wrong"" and gaining weight instead of losing it. In June 2016 and receiving a diagnosis of a rare condition called paradoxical adipose hyperplasia (PAH), according to the story. When PAH occurs, the fat cells frozen during the treatment actually grow bigger instead of shrinking. Essentially, CoolSculpting and similar procedures work by freezing and shrinking the fat cells in adipose tissue (fatty tissue). But in rare cases, like Evangelista's, the opposite can occur, causing the treated fatty tissue to thicken, expand, and harden. Since the first documented case of PAH in 2014, researchers have estimated that as many as one in 138 patients may experience this post-treatment outcome. (Related: Can We Please Stop Talking About ""Belly Fat""?) Studies have shown that liposuction surgery can sometimes help minimize the effects, but in Evangelista's case, two subsequent corrective full-body liposuction surgeries and an intense recovery process did not help, according to the People story. She now lives with ""hard protrusions"" on various parts of her body. ""If I walk without a girdle in a dress, I will have chafing to the point of almost bleeding. Because it's not like soft fat rubbing, it's like hard fat rubbing,"" she says in the interview. Evangelista first opened up about her experience on Instagram last September, sharing that she'd been ""brutally disfigured by Zeltiq's CoolSculpting procedure which did the opposite of what it promised."" She continued, ""It increased, not decreased, my fat cells and left me permanently deformed even after undergoing two painful, unsuccessful, corrective surgeries. I have been left, as the media has described, 'unrecognizable.'"" (Related: Linda Evangelista Says CoolSculpting Left Her 'Permanently Deformed') You've probably heard about the buzzy procedure, which is a non-invasive form of fat-reduction known as cryolipolysis that became the first FDA-cleared treatment of this kind in 2010. It's worth noting that FDA-cleared is not the same as FDA-approved. Something that's FDA-cleared has been proven to be ""substantially equivalent"" to an already cleared or approved product on the market, while FDA-approved means that the agency has determined that the ""benefits of the product outweigh the known risks for the intended use."" (Related: Does CoolSculpting Really Work — And Is It Worth It?) Her decades-long modeling career has been sidelined due to the effects of the CoolSculpting, and she's now suing parent brand Zeltiq for damages due to her experiences. As for why she's speaking out now, ""I can't live like this anymore, in hiding and shame,"" she tells People. ""I just couldn't live in this pain any longer."" Shape reached out to CoolSculpting for comment but did not hear back by the time of publishing. Though Evangelista no longer looks in the mirror she hopes ""I can shed myself of some of the shame and help other people who are in the same situation as me,"" she tells the magazine. She continues, ""Why do we feel the need to do these things [to our bodies]? I always knew I would age. And I know that there are things a body goes through. But I just didn't think I would look like this.""",Health/Shape,Linda Evangelista Shared Photos to Show How CoolSculpting Left Her 'Disfigured',https://news.yahoo.com/linda-evangelista-shared-photos-show-184204275.html
