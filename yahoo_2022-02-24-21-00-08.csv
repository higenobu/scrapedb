2/24/2022,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The chief of the German army vented his frustration over what he sees as the long-running neglect of military readiness in his country in an unusual public rant a few hours after Russia invaded Ukraine, adding that the army was in bad shape. Russian forces invaded Ukraine by land, air and sea on Thursday, confirming the worst fears of the West with the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two. ""In my 41th year of peace-time service, I would not have thought that I would have to experience a war,"" Lieutenant General Alfons Mais said on LinkedIn on Thursday. ""And the Bundeswehr, the army which I have the honour to command, is standing there more or less empty-handed. The options we can offer the government in support of the alliance are extremely limited."" Commentators on LinkedIn praised Mais for his ""brutally honest"" words, many of them backing his veiled criticism of consecutive German governments that have been blamed for not fulfilling NATO's targets for military spending. Germany in January offered to supply 5,000 military helmets to Ukraine to help defend against possible invasion - an offer Kyiv mayor and former world champion boxer Vitali Klitschko dismissed as ""a joke"". ""We have all seen it coming but were not able to get through with our arguments to draw the consequences after (Russia's) annexation of Crimea. This does not feel good. I am fed up with it,"" Mais said in his post. NATO territory had so far not come under direct threat, he said, but Germany's partners in Eastern Europe were feeling constantly rising pressure. ""When, if not now, is the moment to put the Afghanistan mission structurally and with regard to our equipment behind us and overhaul our posture?"" Mais said. ""Otherwise, we will not be able to successfully fulfil our constitutional duty and our obligations in the alliance."" German forces were drastically scaled down after the end of the Cold War, and later trained mainly for missions such as in Afghanistan where the adversary was poorly equipped and not an armed force with the most modern weapons. A spokesman for the German army declined to elaborate on Mais' criticism. ""We have nothing to add to the remarks of the chief of the army on LinkedIn at this moment.""

2/24/2022,"China on Thursday told its citizens in Ukraine to ""stay at home"" or display the national flag. The announcement from the Chinese embassy came the same day Russia attacked Ukraine. Other nations have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine or to be prepared to evacuate. In the hours after Russia launched an attack on Ukraine, the Chinese embassy in Ukraine advised Chinese nationals there to ""stay at home"" or to display the Chinese flag on their cars if they have to go outside. ""Social order is chaotic and out of control, especially when there are periods of serious unrest in the city,"" the embassy wrote in a safety reminder on Thursday. ""It is best to stay at home and away from windows and glass to avoid accidental injury,"" the statement continued. The embassy told citizens that if they have to travel by car, they should take note of where to refuel and should ""affix the Chinese flag at a prominent spot on your car."" Thousands of cars were spotted leaving Kyiv on Thursday morning. In its reminder, the embassy also encouraged Chinese nationals in the country to help each other, suggesting that wealthier Chinese businessmen or Chinese citizens more familiar with Ukraine should offer assistance to the more inexperienced, such as traveling students. The notice did not tell Chinese citizens to evacuate the country. In contrast, other countries have been advising their citizens to leave Ukraine or be ready to evacuate as explosions were heard from Kyiv to the eastern city of Kharkiv, and as Russian tanks were reported to have crossed the border from Belarus and occupied Crimea. The South Korean embassy strongly urged its citizens to prepare to leave Ukraine just before Russian President Vladimir Putin made a surprise announcement on Thursday morning that Russia would launch a ""special military action"" against Ukraine, CNN reported. Other nations such as the US, UK, Japan, and Israel have for days or even weeks told their citizens to evacuate the country as fears of Russia's invasion grew. The embassy's advisory comes as a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry on Thursday refused to describe Russia's attack as an ""invasion"" and called for tensions to de-escalate, The New York Times reported. On Tuesday, the state-owned media outlet Horizon News appeared to have accidentally published a memo instructing Chinese media not to publish anything ""not positive to Russia or positive to the West.""
