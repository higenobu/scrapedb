2/27/2022,"The Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine has played through a filter of propaganda here in Moscow, where the authorities appear concerned that ordinary Russians will be disgusted by scenes of missiles striking Kyiv and have sought to cut off the public from that uncomfortable truth. To do so, the Russian government has taken extraordinary steps by throttling Facebook and threatening to shut independent media outlets such as TV Rain and the newspaper Novaya Gazeta, which published an edition in Russian and Ukrainian this week with the banner headline “Russia is bombing Ukraine”. The media have been told to use only official government sources for their reports and not to use certain words to describe the operation. According to the Latvian-based Russian news website Meduza, the words in question are: “Attack, invasion, war.” The restrictions are a window on how Russia wants to control the picture of its invasion of Ukraine to its own citizens and the unpopular steps, such as slowing and potentially cutting off access to Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, the Kremlin is willing to take. Dmitry Muratov, the editor of Novaya Gazeta, had told the Observer he would defy demands by Roskomnadzor, the media watchdog, for his newspaper to self-censor, saying he would rely only on his own newsroom and his special correspondents. Editors at other independent media have said the same. “Propaganda is like radiation,” said Muratov. “And it has touched many here.” For Russians watching TV, Saturday began like any other: chat shows, some old movies, or a programme about renovating your dacha. But by the afternoon, it had kicked into high gear, with pundits on debate shows either downplaying or outright denying that an invasion was taking place. Viewers of Russian television last week might think that their country was only involved in a small operation in south-east Ukraine, and that the Ukrainian government was seeking to provoke a larger war. “I just watched the Russian news specially and I have to say that if I had only watched that then my picture of the world would be completely different,” said Tatyana Stanovaya, the founder of the analysts R.Politik. “I think it’s entirely possible I would support Putin and his military operation.” The divide has played out strangely in public. In a queue at Sberbank just hours after Putin announced the military operation last week, one woman said loudly that she’d been told by a friend in Kharkiv that “Russia’s bombing us.” Others turned to her angrily, as one responded dismissively: “I haven’t heard anything about that.” All were waiting to exchange roubles for dollars, aware that Russia was about to be hammered by sanctions and that the currency was losing its value at pace. But it can still get worse: in an extraordinary address on Friday evening, Vladimir Putin called on Ukrainian forces to overthrow their government, indicating that his ultimate goal is regime change. “It seems that it will be easier for us to come to an agreement than with this gang of drug addicts and neo-Nazis,” he said. Military analysts see increased movements of heavy weaponry, including rocket artillery, that could point toward Russia attempting an all-out assault on Kyiv, one that would likely lead to higher numbers of dead and wounded. Russia’s ministry of defence ordered all its units to advance on Saturday evening, according to the Interfax news agency. That effort will likely be accompanied by greater Kremlin pressure on the burgeoning anti-war movement in Russia, where activists, including some from Russia’s elite, have spoken out against a war they describe as an act of fratricide. Ilya Krasilshchik, a former media editor and publisher and then head of a popular online food delivery service, said that he hadn’t even bothered to listen to Putin’s announcement of a “special operation” because it was too “revolting”. “I listened to [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy instead,” he said. “As someone said: ‘It’s been a long time since anyone spoke to the Russian people with that kind of love.’” The Ukrainian president on Saturday spoke directly to the Russian people, thanking those who protested for their opposition to the war. He specifically mentioned prominent Russians like Muratov and the blogger Yury Dud, saying that Ukrainians had heard their effort. “Stop those who lie,” said Zelenskiy. “They lie to us. They lie to you. And they are lying to the whole world. We need to stop this war.” There is little likelihood that any protests will change Kremlin policy, which appears to be hardening in preparation for a bigger push on Kyiv. But the split in elite support for the operation indicates that this will be much different from Crimea, where public support was widely seen as about 85%. By contrast, the Levada Centre, an independent polling agency, reported last week that only 45% of Russians supported recognising the Russian-controlled territories in south-east Ukraine. Far fewer are believed to support a full-scale war against Ukraine. Many of those Russians protesting against the war expressed feelings of anger, complicity, shame, and fear at the road the country was heading down. “It’s mixed feelings of anger, fury, shame, you don’t know what to feel,” said Krasilshchik. “Your world is falling apart on all fronts. It’s falling apart from within because you understand your reality is going to be completely different. It means everything. Ethical questions, questions about how you are going to live. “But secondly you realise that at this moment there are people who feel far worse because they are being bombed. My problems… don’t mean anything compared with the problems Ukrainians feel right now. “And thirdly you can’t even share these feelings because for the whole world you’re a pariah and true evil. And your passport is the passport of the aggressor. You don’t even know where to start.” Krasilshchik, who has attended protests for more than 15 years, noted that Putin’s problems which had affected the country were quickly becoming those of the whole world. “I am sure that we are guilty,” said Krasilshchik. “But I don’t understand at what moment we could have done anything differently.” Many on both sides view this as a point of no return. Ilya Barabanov, a Russian reporter who has covered the war in Ukraine for the BBC, wrote in a first-person article he felt similarly to how a German living in Kyiv must have felt on the first day of the second world war. None of his friends had said anything bad to him but a question nagged at him. “When my reporting trip comes to an end, and when the horror of war subsides, how will I be able to return home, to Russia, to my country, that has done this to Ukraine today?” he said.",News/World news,‘Don’t call it a war’ – propaganda filters the truth about Ukraine on Russian media,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/26/propaganda-filters-truth-ukraine-war-russian-media
2/27/2022,"It was not always straightforward or particularly pretty but England’s Six Nations title hopes are still afloat. Six penalties from Marcus Smith, a burgled 43rd-minute try by Alex Dombrandt and some last quarter defensive grit were just enough to see off a spirited Wales on a cool, still evening in south-west London, with Ben Youngs’s record-breaking 115th cap for his country adding to the overall sense of red rose satisfaction. But let’s be honest. The comfortable France win in Edinburgh earlier in the day again put a lot of what we witnessed, particularly in the first half, into stark perspective. A Six Nations season always contains a few snakes and ladders but not many would currently put many euros on Les Bleus or Ireland failing to finish ahead of England in the final table. That is not to say England were poor, just that the game was a couple of notches down on France’s effort at Murrayfield. The last half-hour was enjoyably frantic, with two Wales tries in seven minutes by Josh Adams and Nick Tompkins, but it needed to be fun to make up for a scrappy first half that struggled to match the soaring setting or the clearest of late February blue skies. England, though, have lost two games at home in the Six Nations in the past 10 years – beaten only by Ireland in 2018 and Scotland in 2021 – and there continue to be signs of a decent side trying to get out. Once again Smith was in energetic ringmaster mode, his hitch-kicking sense of adventure always a potential threat. His half-back partner, Harry Randall, also buzzed around promisingly and we will never know what difference a fit Manu Tuilagi might have made. After careful consideration Eddie Jones had decided to fill his Tuilagi-sized hole with Elliot Daly rather than Joe Marchant, reuniting the combination of Daly and Henry Slade. Without Tuilagi to add some pre-set cement to the mix, would there be enough collective solidity? Just about was the final answer but better sides than Wales will pose more demanding questions. The same will be true at the breakdown against Ireland and France, even if England some joy on the floor here. Wales conceded five ruck penalties in the entire game in Cardiff 12 months ago; inside the first 15 minutes of this match they conceded four. England took grateful advantage, Smith slotting two confident early penalties after a good jackal from Maro Itoje and an off-feet misjudgment from Taine Basham. Wales, though, were soon causing problems at the other end. Only a botched lineout wasted a highly promising position deep in England’s 22 and then Alex Cuthbert, winning his 50th cap, galloped through a couple of tackles and might have created a try had he looked up and seen the unmarked Josh Adams lurking out to his left. It was a costly decision, with Wales subsequently penalised for holding on and the momentum shifting back England’s way. The visitors were suddenly under the cosh, hanging on for dear life in front of their own posts. When Liam Williams was sent to the sin-bin for interfering with England’s ball close to the line and Owen Watkin and Tomas Francis departed for head injury assessments, it seemed as if England might have their neighbours snookered. To Wales’s considerable relief a scrum penalty relieved the pressure and the early departure of a limping Luke Cowan-Dickie also forced the hosts to reset slightly. A knock-on by Max Malins offered Wales the chance to launch a thrilling counterattack with scrum-half Tomos Williams displaying the handling skills of a pro basketballer to set Cuthbert away again. England needed another catalyst to stir them back into life and it arrived in the form of a thumping Tom Curry tackle that led directly to another penalty. This time Smith, having pushed a previous penalty effort narrowly wide, nailed the three-pointer and a 9-0 lead was a fair reflection of a scrappy but hotly contested match. The sweet left feet of Daly, enjoying a decent game at 13, and Slade also kept Wales pinned back with angled kicks to touch, the Exeter man earned his side a 50:22 throw-in five metres out with one particularly lovely strike. It did not bear immediate scoreboard fruit but with Smith and Randall keeping the defence guessing another prolonged spell of England pressure produced a further three points just before the interval. Wales needed the breather, having had to make almost twice as many tackles as their opponents, but within three minutes of the restart the game effectively slipped away from them. Ryan Elias’s throw in his own 22 sailed right over the top to a rampaging Dombrandt who surged past Cuthbert and was adjudged to have touched the ball down at full stretch despite the last-ditch intervention of Taulupe Faletau. Wales were left to complain Adam Beard had been tugged down in the lineout but with Sam Simmonds having appeared at half-time in place of Curry surely there was no way England were going to blow a 17-0 lead. Or was there? With nothing to lose Wales picked up the pace and Williams’s fine miss pass put Adams over on the left. Then Tompkins picked a nice line and Dan Biggar’s conversion reduced the deficit to five points with 19 minutes left. To the relief of Youngs, and England, it proved the high-water mark of the rising crimson tide.",Sport/Sport,England rely on Marcus Smith accuracy to hold off Wales’s second-half charge,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/26/england-wales-six-nations-rugby-union-match-report
2/27/2022,"You’ve all seen it now. The small, mean, vicious yet weirdly blank eyes. The stubby stabbing fingers that jab as he humiliates his underlings, making them shake with fear. The joy he takes in sadism. It’s almost comedy villain stuff. But cliches exist for a reason. And we need to stop kidding ourselves about Putin – and start taking steps to deal with him. For decades we’ve wanted to avoid the challenge. Not so much appease as just hope he goes away. It’s a headache having to face up to the blunt fact that Putin is trying to utterly change the world. His aims are impossible to ignore now. The Kremlin’s foreign policy thinktanks are already churning out articles about how his invasion of Ukraine means the start of a “multipolar world”. Ignore the geopolitical PR. All multipolar means here is emboldened fascism. Before the political scientists among you get all carried away debating endlessly what “fascism” means let me explain my terms. I mean Orwell’s boot stamping endlessly on people’s faces. I mean the underlying psychology that shines through in the violence that suffuses all of Putin’s language. Just last week, to give one small example, as Putin spoke with Macron, the Russian president casually invoked a Russian rape joke about Sleeping Beauty to explain what he would soon do to Ukraine. Conflating Ukraine and Sleeping Beauty, he gleefully put himself in the role of the rapist: “Whether you like it or not my beauty, you will need to put up with all I do to you.” (It rhymes in Russian.) I mean the way he uses grievance narratives, always complaining how the world has put him down. There are many people – minorities, the economically disadvantaged – who bear righteous grievance. But when the world’s richest man, a blatant bully, does it, it means something else. The German psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, in his great study of the Nazi mind, described how for the Nazis claiming they were victims was really a way to excuse how they would victimise others. It’s the same for Putin. His regime is, on the surface, nothing like the Nazis. Russia has its own totalitarian traditions to tap into. But the underlying mindset is the same. Even his claims to Russia’s “spheres of influence” are more about his state of mind than international relations. The issue here is not about rational security demands which can be defined in negotiations and balanced with the security concerns of others – not least Ukraine. Putin’s sphere of influence waxes and wanes. It can mean the Russosphere, the 100 million or so Russian speakers who live beyond Russia’s borders, many in the EU. It can mean the mystical idea of a “single people” that encompasses Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. It can denote much of central Europe, the countries which, according to Russia’s foreign affairs ministry, were “orphaned” by the end of the USSR and now, it’s implied, need to return to the suffocating embrace of Moscow. Henry Dicks, the psychoanalyst who studied Nazi soldiers during the second world war, came to the conclusion that Hitler’s idea of Lebensraum, the land (much of it in Ukraine) Germans claimed belonged to them, was not just a geopolitical idea but a sign of a psychology that was so steeped in humiliation it grabbed things outside itself to sate its sense of endless inadequacy. Like an angry infant that doesn’t understand its own borders, grabbing things beyond it and screaming “mine!” This is the endless cycle in these regimes: a culture of humiliation; a sense of inadequacy; aggression. But let’s not over-focus on the Nazis – that always makes us feel good because we fought them. Putin reminds us of the worst about ourselves as well. The day the invasion launched, at the UN, it was the representatives from Kenya and Ghana who grasped the meaning of what was going on the quickest, comparing Ukraine to their own colonial legacy. “We must complete our recovery from the embers of dead empires in a way that does not plunge us back into new forms of domination and oppression,” said Kenya’s permanent representative. It might be comforting to think of Putin as merely a throwback to the past – but his ambition is for his worldview to dominate the future, and his mindset to be normalised. He does not think parochially. He is already threatening Finland and Sweden. His theory is to attack his great adversaries – the EU, Britain and America – in any way he can to keep us weak and clear his way. He has been doing it for years by making Europe addicted to his energy, Britain to his corruption, everyone intimidated by his assassinations. For decades we tried to tell ourselves this was just an inconvenience, that ultimately he just wanted a stake in a world, or at least a transatlantic space, where wars were over. He didn’t see it that way. His political and economic warfare will now increase – to pave the way for more kinetic wars. Today this is all focused on one place: Ukraine. Which Putin is invading, bombing, murdering with impunity. He claims Ukrainians don’t exist as an independent people – so it’s OK to murder them. His plan is to install a puppet government and then execute any dissidents. But Ukrainians aren’t puppets. Ukrainians very much exist. This is the great achilles heel in Putin’s worldview. He is the arch conspiracy theorist: and for conspiracy theorists people are all puppets, moved around great chess boards. He doesn’t understand that people have volition. Sean Penn, the actor turned film-maker who is in the capital Kyiv shooting a documentary, summed it up thus: “Ukraine is at the tip of the spear for the democratic embrace of dreams. If we allow it to fight alone, our soul as America is lost.” “Democracy”; “dreams”; “soul”: these are big words. So overused in political speech I sometimes struggle to know what they signify. Ukrainians are giving them meaning again. They are fighting and dying for a new democracy to make people in rich, old democracies remember what democracy is all about. Many of these Ukrainians are my friends, relatives, colleagues, loved ones. I was born in Kyiv – though from childhood I grew up in London – and much of my work is there. They’ve all chosen to remain and take up arms. Over the last years we’ve all been researching Ukrainian identity together. We’ve found that what unites Ukrainians is the resilience and resourcefulness to survive endless hardships: a people who have got through the oppressions of Russian tsars; Stalin’s enforced famine; the second world war (where most of the fighting was in Ukraine); Nazi occupation; Chernobyl; the revolution of dignity … and now this. My friends are taking up arms, and when I message them are miles more calm, resolute and focused than I am, typing away in a Nato country and praying for the best. Watching Putin’s invasion on television can make one feel quite powerless. Putin wants the whole world to witness his aggression, to grind in the point there’s nothing that can stop him. What can we, sitting in Britain, do to join the fight? Plenty. For starters, we can all help to support now by pressuring our governments, and raising funds ourselves, to do the following smattering of urgent causes. First: Ukraine has a right to zones safe from bombing and missile attack. According to the responsibility to protect (R2P) doctrine the international community has a duty to provide appropriate diplomatic, humanitarian and if necessary military means to help protect populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. Creating such safe zones would be a start, though what every Ukrainian is pleading for is to protect their skies with no fly zones, and help them against one of the largest air forces in the world. Meanwhile people need water, blankets, food, fuel and helmets. The army needs anti-tank and anti-aircraft weapons. Though sanctions are starting, we need to hit the money behind Putin’s war machine much harder. Sanction the central bank and state-owned banks, the wallets Putin uses to finance his imperial adventures. Freeze the western assets and visas of Putin’s oligarchs and their families who help finance his war. But these tiny moves are just the start of what is needed. For the EU it will mean weaning itself quickly off Russian energy. For the UK it will mean reforming our rotten financial sector and stop being, in the journalist Oliver Bullough’s killer phrase, “butlers to the world”: that would be real sovereignty. And for Nato members beyond America it will mean getting ready to spend much more on arms. Putin thinks we won’t go through with any changes because all our talk of “democracy” and “values” are just bunk. As he announced the invasion of Ukraine, his prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, scoffed that the west would soon give up on sanctions because we are dependent upon Russia. We may have taken Putin for a comedy villain – he’s betting that we’re the joke.

2/27/2022,"For believers in fate, the narrative arc of Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja’s story is about to reach its peak. Out of Australia’s men’s Test team for more than two years, the 35-year-old Pakistan-born batter forced his way back into the starting XI with twin centuries in this year’s Sydney Ashes Test. It was a match he was only playing in because Travis Head, ahead of him for the No 5 batting spot, had tested positive for Covid. Now, Khawaja is on his way back to the country of his birth as part of the first Australia tour to Pakistan in 24 years. “I’m not that much of a narcissist that I believe that there’s an agenda with fate,” says Khawaja, shortly before Australia’s departure. “There’s nothing saying that all this happened just so that I could go back to Pakistan. But I am a God-believing man and I do believe that fate comes from God. According to sources inside Cricket Australia, Khawaja has been an important sounding board for those in the team with questions about Pakistan, a country many of his teammates are visiting for the first time. “Maybe this was meant to be, and I was meant to be on this tour – that is, if I don’t get Covid, I don’t want to count my chickens too early!” laughs Khawaja. “But as long as everything goes fine, fate or no fate, it’s worked out really well. From where I was a year ago, outside of the team, nowhere to be seen, to be here now, it’s almost worked out perfectly.” Having first forced his way into the Test team on the back of a stellar domestic season in 2011 to become the first Muslim man to win an Australian Test cap, it was Khawaja’s domestic form, captaining Queensland to last year’s Sheffield Shield title, which has once again forced him back into contention. Now a father, a husband, a state captain and a more settled mind than the young, at times brash, cricketer who first wore the baggy green, Khawaja is confident of the reception he and Australia’s cricketers will receive on arrival in Pakistan. “We’ve always had great support from Pakistan,” says Khawaja, who was born in Islamabad, where the first Test takes place on March 4, but emigrated to Australia with his family at the age of just five. Of his wider family who still live in Pakistan, most live in Karachi, the venue for the second Test on March 12. “I’m not sure how many of them will be turning up, to be honest. I’m sure we’ll get some ticket requests closer to the date. But from all over the subcontinent I’ve always had great support. Even from the subcontinental Australians living over here [in Australia]. I don’t think it will be too different, I think they’ll still support me, but they’ll also be hoping that we get absolutely smashed. After speculation Australian players might opt out of the tour over security concerns, following the cancellation of England and New Zealand’s tours to the country last year, head men’s selector George Bailey confirmed instead last month that no player had made themselves unavailable for the three-test/ three-ODI/ one T20 series. “I wasn’t really involved in anything behind the scenes,” says Khawaja, who was elected onto the Australian Cricketers’ Association board last year. “But Cricket Australia and the ACA, they did all the hard work. I was obviously quite vocal. Not so much directly to individuals, more so just about where we were in Australian cricket, what we could do about giving back. In terms of security, I was always along the lines of, well, if Cricket Australia is saying that it’s safe for us to go and everything’s alright, then it probably is. “I think it helped that representatives from the ACA and Cricket Australia actually went on the ground, they did their due diligence,” continues Khawaja. “They didn’t do it from afar. And when they came back they said that it was really good, it was unbelievable over there, it far exceeded what they had thought. That was a big stepping stone in the whole thing.” As well as his own role, Khawaja also revealed the major part past Australian cricketers have played in ensuring a full-strength Australian side goes to Pakistan. “Shane Watson has been massive,” says Khawaja. “As ACA President, he’s been very vocal in terms of all of his experience in Pakistan [playing in the Pakistan Super League] and how good it’s been. Actually, it’s been the same talking to a lot of the older players too, who have been in Pakistan, including a few guys who played in the [Australia] A series over there. “Talking to Darren Lehmann and other guys who have been to Pakistan before, they have had nothing but great experiences. To hear that, at the end of the day, it gives you a bit of confidence.”",Sport/Sport,Stars align for Khawaja to ‘give back’ on historic Pakistan tour,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/27/stars-align-for-khawaja-to-give-back-on-historic-pakistan-tour
2/27/2022,"Children under the age of five are not yet able to be vaccinated against Covid leaving some parents worried their younger children could catch the virus from older siblings who have returned to school. Less than 50% of children aged five to 11 have received their first vaccine dose. But it is hoped child vaccination rates will be bolstered by Australia becoming the first country to approve the Moderna vaccine for children aged six and over. Pfizer continues to be available to children aged five and over. But will children under five ever be eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine? How many doses will be enough for children? And is a first-dose rate of less than 50% in the five to 11-year-old age group enough to protect the most vulnerable? Australia’s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has not yet received an application from any pharmaceutical company to extend the use of any approved Covid vaccine to children under five. If an application is made, it will need to include data from clinical trials to demonstrate the vaccine is safe and effective in this age group. A spokesperson from the TGA said any such application “will be evaluated by the TGA with the greatest priority”. Pfizer has clinical studies under way in the US of its Covid vaccine in children aged from six months to four years old, with results due in April. The Pfizer dosage for anyone aged 12 and above is 30 micrograms a dose, while children aged five to 12 receive 10 micrograms a dose. In the Pfizer trial for children under five, two doses of three micrograms were given. In December, Pfizer said it was changing the design of the trial to include a third dose. This was because while the three micrograms dosage for six-month to two-year-olds produced an immune response as effective as that seen in children aged five and up, the same dosage generated an inferior immune response in the two to five-year-old age group. If a vaccine for children under five is eventually registered by the TGA, the health department will seek final advice and approval from its independent panel of vaccination experts, Atagi. This is an important step because Atagi will carefully consider the relevant risks, benefits and uncertainties of the evidence, from the clinical trials and any real-world use of the vaccine in this age group that may become available over time. In Australia, the vaccination rollout for children aged five to 11 started on 10 January. But in England, children in the same age group will not be offered the Covid vaccine until April. For now, England is focusing its vaccination efforts on immunocompromised children aged five to 11 and adolescents. The rollout for children in England is being described as “non-urgent” by health officials compared with its rollout for older children and adults. In Australia, increasing the vaccine uptake in the five to 11-year-old group is being treated with more urgency. The US has been pushing for vaccination of five to 11-year-olds since October. More than seven million children in the age group have safely received doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the US. There are unique contexts in each country that regulators consider, including what proportion of the population is vaccinated or has already had Covid, the variants circulating and the proportion of vulnerable people vaccinated or at risk. The World Health Organization advises countries to consider the individual and population-level benefits of immunising children and adolescents according to their own epidemiological and social contexts. The UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) had previously taken the view that it may be unethical to vaccinate children in order to protect others, given children do not normally serious symptoms from Covid-19, but can very rarely experience serious but treatable vaccine side-effects. JCVI previously said that although the health gains from vaccinating children are greater than the risks, “the margin of benefit is considered too small” to support broad child vaccination on health grounds alone. This advice changed in February when JCVI recommended non-urgent vaccination of children to protect against rare cases of severe illness, in advance of a potential future coronavirus wave. However, the experts emphasised that vaccination of the five to 11 age group may not be recommended in the future. In Australia, regulators took the view that vaccinating children would probably directly benefit all in the community through decreased infection and severe disease, while also having indirect benefits through reduced transmission and reduced disruption to schooling, sports and other organised activities. In Australia those aged five and over who have an immunocompromised condition are already advised to receive a third dose. The TGA has not received an application to extend the use of any Covid-19 vaccine as a booster for those aged under 16 more generally. But the Royal Australian College of Physicians president-elect and paediatrician, Dr Jacqueline Small, said the two-dose vaccination course generates a strong immune response in young people. “It is too early to tell how long immunity will last in children aged under 16 years and what benefit booster doses would provide,” Small said. “However, there is some suggestion [two doses] may be longer lasting than in adults. It is vitally important that the current focus on Covid vaccination not displace existing vaccinations as recommended in National Immunisation Program Schedule. There are growing concerns that other health care interventions, including other childhood vaccinations, are being neglected through the pandemic. “Data also shows that severe disease or death was significantly lower in adolescents who had received two doses of vaccine compared those who were unvaccinated.” Small said the best protection for children under five, until a vaccine is available, is for adults and older children to be vaccinated. Other public health measures, including hand hygiene, social distancing, cough and sneeze etiquette and mask wearing also help prevent infection during significant community transmission. “It is important that children attend school and participate in other activities that are important for their health and development,” she said. “We know that Covid-19 infection in children generally involves no symptoms or causes a brief illness with mild symptoms.” Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Fiona Russell, a paediatrician and professor at the University of Melbourne, said even if a child has already been infected, vaccination is recommended if they are eligible. “Recent data has shown evidence of prior infection recently jumped from 55% to 97% in eight to 11-year-olds in the UK within a few weeks during the Omicron outbreak, indicating just how fast and transmissible this variant is,” she said. While hospitalisations from Omicron are rare, they do occur in about three in 100,000 children, according to data from the Netherlands and US during their virus peaks. “About one in 3,000 go on to develop a treatable multi-system inflammatory condition after the acute infection,” Russell said. “Reinfections occur. These things are vaccine-preventable, so vaccination is recommended. “No parent would want their child to be a statistic.”",News/Australia news,Explainer: when will Covid vaccines be available for children under five?,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/27/explainer-when-will-covid-vaccines-be-available-for-children-under-five

But the more I deprived myself of something, the more I craved it,” he says. In one go, he might end up eating a couple of packets of biscuits or a whole big bag of chips. “You’re not conscious of the quantity that you’re eating, you just want to keep eating.

He would “come out of it” when he had run out of food, get interrupted or because he had got to the point where he simply could not eat any more. “It’s something that you would only do when nobody’s around, or in secret when you think nobody can tell that that’s happening.” Throughout his life, says Ikin, he would hear different versions of the same question: “Why don’t you just stop?” And yet, he didn’t think he had a problem with food. “I knew I had some sort of psychological problem, but I would never imagine that I could have an eating disorder.” It took until his early 30s for Sam to receive a diagnosis: he had binge eating disorder (BED), the most common, and perhaps least understood, eating disorder. BED is an illness that drives people to consume unusually large amounts of food in one go frequently and consistently over a period of time. Similar to those who suffer from bulimia nervosa, people living with BED feel they can’t stop themselves from eating. But unlike bulimia nervosa, BED is not associated with compensatory behaviour such as excessive exercise, vomiting or taking laxatives. It is not limited to people who are overweight or obese, but is more common in that group. Ikin says BED is often mistaken for a pleasurable spree, an indulgence. It is associated with laziness, he says, and lack of self-discipline. “A binge isn’t a pleasurable experience,” he says. “It’s a mindless experience where your hand moves backwards and forwards from your mouth and back to the food. In the end, you feel awful. You look at all the empty packets, all of the evidence, and the first thing that sets in is shame. The shame part is huge.” He would try to hide it, binge in secret where he could, “try to fit a binge in between going shopping or things like that”. With kids in the house, he would want to eat all the junk food and hide it from them, too. “Bingeing is awful,” he says. The disorder has pervaded his whole life, from the day-to-day inconveniences of being overweight to facing societal expectations and judgment. “You can’t fly in aeroplanes comfortably, you can’t buy a suit off the rack, you can’t even go into some shops without being looked at like you’re a leper,” he says. In Australia, 47% of all people with an eating disorder have BED, compared with 3% living with anorexia nervosa, 12% with bulimia nervosa and 38% other eating disorders. It is as common in men as it is in women. In total, eating disorders affect around one million Australians. Binge eating was officially recognised as a disorder by the American Psychiatric Association only in 2013 and remains less commonly understood than other eating disorders and under-diagnosed by health professionals. In Australia, less than two in five people with BED access medical care, and the pandemic may have made things even worse. “Binge eating is often unrecognised because we can’t say how people may look,” says Dr Jane Miskovic-Wheatley, the research stream lead at the InsideOut Institute at the University of Sydney. She says most people with BED might be within their normal weight range or overweight, as the majority of the Australian population are. Historically, the first medical reports about eating disorders described young, white, thin women. This image has stuck in the collective consciousness, leading to biased medical research and diagnostic criteria. “It’s pervasive, even among academics and health professionals,” says Dr Deborah Mitchison, an NHMRC research fellow at the Translational Health Research Institute at Western Sydney University. These “historical blindspots” have prevented researchers from learning about how an eating disorder looks in a man or someone with a larger body, she says. A diagnosis for BED can take years, even decades, and too often, all medical professionals have to offer their patients is a “eat less, exercise more” message, Mitchison says. “That is too simplistic. They actually have a psychological disorder, and it’s not being picked up.” As with other eating disorders, there are various factors which may lead to someone develop binge eating disorder, ranging from environmental, social and cultural issues to genetics and an individual’s own thoughts and feelings. There are also reported links with depression and anxiety. A recent review from the Florey Institute and University of Melbourne found there are a range of biological differences between men and women that trigger binge eating, including hormones, stress and neural circuitry. For Ikin, an episode could be trigged by an urge towards the extremes. “If I’m having a crap day, if I’m very upset, that might trigger a binge. But it also happens sometimes when I’m feeling good, and I can’t explain it,” he says. “You want to augment the emotions that you’re having - whether it’s positive or negative you want to take it to the extreme.” The World Health Organization predicted a mental health pandemic after Covid, and research is increasingly corroborating this prediction. A survey by the InsideOut Institute released last month revealed an escalation in eating disorder symptoms during the first major Covid wave in Australia and a widespread failure to access treatment. Sixty-six per cent of respondents reported an increase in binge eating compared with before the pandemic. Other disordered eating behaviours increased starkly too, with 74% of participants reporting increased food restriction. “The biggest element of the pandemic that had a negative impact on people with lived experience of eating disorders was a change in daily routine,” says Miskovic-Wheatley, who led the study. That included not being able to engage with their family and friends, maintain a balanced lifestyle and access medical care. The survey unveiled alarmingly low diagnosis and treatment rates, says Miskovic-Wheatley. Despite nearly all responders (96%) reporting experiencing active eating disorder symptoms, only half engaged in treatment. During the past two years, psychotherapists have been inundated with requests from past and new patients. Waiting times for an appointment have protracted up to 12 months. “Such long lists can be quite off-putting for many people,” says psychologist and PhD student at the InsideOut Institute Sarah Barakat. Barakat says there are three main barriers people with BED face in accessing treatment. The most significant is cost. From November 2019, people with eating disorders can access up to 40 psychological sessions with a mental health provider and up to 20 sessions with a dietitian every calendar year with a referral from their GP. But eating disorder specialists’ rates can be high, and the out-of-pocket fee after the Medicare rebate remains unaffordable for most, Barakat says. Then, there is a geographical barrier. The vast majority of specialist services for eating disorders are concentrated in large metropolitan areas. Access to care in outskirts, rural and remote regions can be inadequate and, in many cases, nonexistent. The third hurdle is the shame associated with the disorder. “There’s still a high level of stigma and embarrassment around eating behaviours,” says Barakat. “People who have binge eating disorder are much less likely to seek care.” She says fewer than than 40% of people with BED access professional help. She is now running a randomised control trial to assess the efficacy of a self-help treatment program based on cognitive behaviour therapy and delivered entirely via a digital platform. She hopes the e-therapy will overcome those barriers, making treatments more affordable and accessible for those who don’t live in the city. “It also offers a step into the treatment world that is not overwhelming or confronting for the patient, who has the opportunity to have more privacy and anonymity.” There is a huge need to talk about binge eating disorder to break the stigma still attached to it, says Ikin. Now in his 40s, he has learned to cope with his illness by planning his meals scrupulously and dissociating food from his emotions with the help of his therapist. “I think I’m on the right track now,” he says. “People are starting to understand and destigmatise mental illness like depression, anxiety and even OCD, while around eating disorders there is still a lot of stigmas and lack of understanding. “I used to lie about it all the time,” he says. Now that he has opened up about his illness, he feels freer to be himself and can benefit from support from his family and friends. “It’s good not to be hiding anymore.” In Australia, the Butterfly Foundation is on 1800 33 4673.

2/27/2022,"Truth is meant to be the first casualty of war, but in Britain the ability to tell the truth about Russia was gunned down before Putin ordered his armies to advance. You need to write about Russian power to understand fully the anger and shame plutocratic censorship brings. Anger because Britain is our country, and claims to be a free country, and yet foreign oligarchs can manipulate the truth here as surely as Putin can in Russia. Shame because we cannot perform the first duty of journalists and speak in plain English without our newspapers accepting the risk of staggering legal costs. In the safe space of the House of Commons, Labour MP Chris Bryant quoted from leaked government documents, which stated Roman Abramovich should be watched because of “his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices”. God help anyone who says as much outside when the government has not put him on its sanctions list. Bear the costs of challenging wealth in mind when you wonder how London became a centre of corruption. Anglo-Saxon law brings class justice rather than real justice. The verdicts of individual judges are not to blame – whatever their faults, they do not take bribes. But the price of reaching a verdict is so high that few dare run the risk of being left with the bill. A system can be rigged even if the people in charge of it are honest, and there is institutional prejudice in the English justice system in favour of wealth that is as pervasive as institutional racism in the police. Let one example stand for thousands. The Parisian intellectual Nicolas Tenzer tweeted that the French equivalents of George Galloway and Nigel Farage acted as the Kremlin’s “useful idiots” when they appeared on Putin’s propaganda channel RT. RT sued, claiming that not only had Tenzer libelled the station but that he was guilty of an “encroachment on the dignity” of its journalists – as if security guards did not strip its hacks of dignity every time they went to work. Naturally, the French courts found against RT. Astonishingly to anyone involved in the struggles for free speech in the UK, the cost of the case was just €10,000 (£8,400). Compare that with the price of writing about the Putin regime in the UK. In January 2021, after Putin’s agents had poisoned him but before he was jailed, the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny praised Catherine Belton’s Putin’s People. It is indeed the book of the moment, which shows how KGB men created the world’s most dangerous rogue state. Abramovich, three other Russian billionaires and Putin’s energy company Rosneft sued. The case was trivial. Belton’s publishers HarperCollins settled it agreeing to make changes to the text most readers wouldn’t notice. Yet although it never went to a full hearing, the case, it was revealed to me, cost HarperCollins £1.5m – 178 times the price of the libel trial in France. In effect, HarperCollins was fined a small fortune for publishing an anti-Putin book by the English legal system. You may not care about journalists when it is the police’s job to arrest the corrupt. “Our” rich man’s law ensures, however, that the police have pretty much given up. The government introduced unexplained wealth orders in 2018 as a “full-spectrum” assault on illicit wealth being laundered through the property market. It did not realise that the fantastically wealthy could hire London’s best lawyers, who are more than a match for the barristers the state can afford. When the National Crime Agency lost a case against the family of Rakhat Aliyev, a former deputy chief of the Kazakh state security service, it had to pay £1.5m in legal costs, which seems to be becoming a standard charge in the high court. Its annual budget for tracking down money launderers was all but wiped out. The story of the world in the 21st century is of a rise in the power of dictatorial states and their accomplices and the collapse in the power of democratically accountable police forces and journalists who are meant to combat them. If we were capable of feeling shame at the misery that Britain’s corruption inflicts on the world, we would radically reform the law. We would move closer to a continental legal system. We would make judging a career in its own right and phase out the recruitment of judges from the ranks of barristers and solicitors, who appear to think obscene costs are reasonable. We would stop selling English law as a luxury service in the global marketplace and say its first duty should be to meet the needs of the people of this country. And we would impose limits on the fees the lawyers of the super rich can charge in the high court. As it is, I suspect nothing will happen. Aside from Private Eye and a handful of patriotic MPs, no one highlights how a section of legal London profits from Russian billionaires. The lawyers who went for Catherine Belton included Hugh Tomlinson, who is on the board of Hugh Grant’s Hacked Off, which says it wants to hold “power to account”, not act as its servant, and Geraldine Proudler, who until recently was on the board of the Scott Trust, which regulates us here at the Guardian and Observer and ensures we maintain the highest ethical standards. Get off your high horse, lawyers tell me when I raise an eyebrow. Everyone would do the same if they had the chance. And if not everyone, then many would and do. It’s not only lawyers who simper pieties about respecting human rights while slipping wads of oligarchical cash into their pockets. Politicians, footballers, estate agents, private school head teachers, hedge fund managers, bankers, art gallery owners and whole sections of the professional class are hooked on dirty money. The Treasury opposes every anti-corruption measure because, I suspect, it sees their dependence clearly. It regards the British economy with deep pessimism. It notes the poor quality of our managers and entrepreneurs, and the self-inflicted wound of Brexit, and concludes that dirty money is better than no money. As Russian tanks roll across Europe, a true cause for anger and shame is that at no point have we had a public debate about whether we want a future where we are living off immoral earnings and are so frightened of immoral lawyers we no longer dare describe what this country has become.

2/27/2022,"It is feeding time at the Tolga bat hospital on the Atherton Tablelands, in the hills west of Cairns. Garlands of sliced apples, pears and rockmelon festoon the feeding shelter. High above us, flying foxes are watching, their eyes bright with interest, their ears swivelling like radar dishes. They clamber down and bury their faces in this all-you-can-eat fruit salad. Never have bats been more relatable. I am on a guided tour of the Queensland hospital led by its founder, Jenny Maclean. The hospital is set on two hectares of land tucked into forested hills. As we stroll among the impossible green of tropical foliage, riflebirds – inky males with iridescent bibs, and females in cinnamon and nutmeg – rustle through the trees. Somewhere in the distance, sulphur-crested cockatoos shriek their arrival, but the most prominent sounds are the chatter and trills of flying foxes. Jenny began her work with bats in 1990. Her first patients were two baby spectacled flying foxes, orphaned when their mothers were killed by tick paralysis. Thirty years later, the hospital cares for 1,000 bats a year. The facilities include a nursery, a six-metre-high flight cage, an area shared between recuperating adults and pups transitioning from nursery to flight cage, and an enclosure for tiny insect-eating microbats. About half of the flying foxes that pass through the hospital are orphaned pups. Brought in between October and December, at the peak of tick season, they are housed in the nursery and then released in groups from February to March, when old enough to care for themselves. Now that the youngsters are on their way to join the wild colony at the Tolga Scrub, the quiet nursery building is being used as a research lab by visiting scientists. Last season was a good one for flying foxes, Jenny tells us. The number of orphans was well down. In the previous year, 250 babies had been brought into the nursery. During times of heat stress on the coast, when searing daytime temperatures kill adults in the trees, that number can double. Although the pups are seasonal, the hospital sees a steady intake of other patients. Many have suffered injuries from barbed wire fences, almost invisible at night. The hospital works with local landholders to make their fences more wildlife-friendly. Focusing on “hotspots” where bats regularly become snagged on barbed wire has reduced the number of collisions. The largest contingent at the hospital is of endangered spectacled flying foxes, easily recognised by the rings around their eyes and peach-coloured fur across neck and shoulders. Clustered with them are black flying foxes with dark chocolate mantles. The little red flying foxes hang out together. Flying foxes are important pollinators. Some gum trees pump up nectar production at night to attract them to the flowers. In turn, bats carry pollen between trees. This relationship is a vital part of forest ecosystems. Not all of the hospital’s patients are as big and boisterous as the flying foxes. In the microbat enclosure we are introduced to Lady Di, a diadem leaf-nosed bat. She is small and round with huge ears, tiny eyes and a lot of self-assurance. Unlike flying foxes, which use vision to find their way around, Lady Di understands her world through sound. She emits high-pitched calls and interprets their echoes to get an idea of her surroundings. The calls are inaudible to us, so Jenny uses a bat detector app to translate the ultrasound into lower frequencies. Pulses appear on the screen as Lady Di explores the world from her perch. She seems as curious about us as we are about her. Some of the hospital’s bats have become internet favourites. For a few weeks, Jinx, a baby eastern tube-nosed bat, was the star of the hospital’s Instagram account. Jinx is now back in the rainforest, but another tube-nosed bat is recovering at the hospital. One of my favourite species, tube-noses have bug eyes and snorkel nostrils, and their wings are dappled yellow like spots of sunlight on leaves. This upside-down world of bats is weird and fascinating. This article includes content provided by Instagram.

Later, when I go for an evening walk, the path is littered with sprays of eucalyptus flowers snipped off by mischievous cockatoos. Overhead, a flying fox is silhouetted against the darkening sky. On measured wingbeats, it heads towards the forest to feed on the flowers the cockatoos have missed. It is easy to overlook the work of these bats because they do it all in the dark. The Tolga bat hospital at 134 Carrington Road, Atherton, is 90 minutes’ drive from Cairns via the Kennedy Highway or Gillies Range Road.

2/27/2022,"On her first day in an exciting new job, Mzia walked in to find a small “Breville style” coffee machine placed on a computer desk in the reception. Next to the machine was a container of long-life milk. Mzia looked at the small Breville machine and told a senior manager: “This is not a commercial machine.” It was, according to evidence aired at the disability royal commission, hardly what she needed to provide “barista training” at the BusyBeans “coffee school”. The BusyBeans program won awards, was later spruiked by the NDIS as a grants success story, and Mzia said the way it was advertised meant she had been thrilled about the opportunity. “I was gobsmacked,” she told the inquiry of what she walked into. “I thought it would be a lot more set up.” The royal commission this week examined the disability employment services (Des) program, a $1bn-a-year federal government scheme in which private companies and non-profits are paid to place people with disability into work. It once again touched on a long-standing criticism of the system: that privatised providers can refer the jobseekers on their books to jobs or training courses run by a related entity. For each placement, the job agency gets an “outcome” payment from the government. They get further payments if the person stays in the job or course, hitting certain weekly benchmarks. The employer, meanwhile, might get wage subsidies from the government to cover the cost of the new workers. And the programs they run – supported employment or training – might garner government grants. Yet, according to a recent report commissioned by the government and obtained by Guardian Australia under freedom of information laws, genuine employment outcomes are underwhelming. The royal commission this week focused on one “region” of BusyBeans coffee schools, a program established by health services company Rehab Management in March 2019. It heard a related entity, AimBig, was a Des provider that referred jobseekers on its books to the BusyBeans program. Among them was Mzia, who lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and hadn’t been in a permanent job in 25 years. Under the BusyBeans model, people with disability – either paid, in part using about government wage subsidies, or unpaid interns – learned to make coffee with trainers like Mzia. They served as in-house baristas for workers at AimBig and Rehab Management offices or other external businesses or worked in a “café environment”. Mzia had lengthy experience in casual hospitality jobs and was adept at making coffee, but she had no formal qualifications. There was no induction or training when she started the job, Mzia told the inquiry. And at her site at least, the inquiry heard, there often weren’t enough people in the office to make coffee for. This meant the participants – who were autistic or had moderate intellectual disabilities – would be “stuck in the office five hours a day, three days a week, just standing in the front of the Breville machine”, the hearing was told. And it heard there were no documents or training manuals to outline how BusyBeans would train participants – people on the autism spectrum and with “moderate” intellectual disability. That was until November 2019, when Rehab Management adopted materials Mzia had created herself. Asked why there were no training documents, a AimBig senior manager, Matthew Ting, told the inquiry BusyBeans was intended to be “hands on” and “definitely not accredited training”. Mzia told the royal commission she found the BusyBeans job herself but was asked to sign a form saying AimBig had found the job for her. Later, she said she was asked to interview potential BusyBeans participants from AimBig’s caseload of jobseekers. And she alleged she felt pressured into putting them forward even if they were not suitable. The inquiry heard the company did not believe there was a conflict of interest between these roles as employment agency and employer. Fronting the commission on its third day of hearing on Friday, Marcella Romero, the chief executive of Arriba Group, the holding company for AimBig and Rehab Management, apologised to Mzia. “We did not live our ‘people’ value in that instance,” she said. Romero said in a media statement that the program had placed “people with a disability into stable ongoing employment” and that she was “proud” of its results. “I acknowledge that BusyBeans program experienced certain challenges in the early stages of the program,” she said. “We will continue to take the feedback from participants onboard and continue to make improvements to the program, which will include appropriately considering how to implement any recommendations that may emerge from the disability royal commission.” Romero said the company would “hope to explore how we may be able to re-establish the program in future”. Despite the free flow of government payments, Ting said the BusyBeans program lost the company money. Romero noted BusyBeans employees were paid “real” wages, unlike so-called “sheltered workshops”, known as Australian Disability Enterprises, where people with disability can legally be paid a few dollars an hour. Ting also disputed that workers were generally let go after 26 weeks, a key benchmark that triggers a substantial government payment. He pointed to one AimBig promotional video showing a “cafe” set-up, which he said showed the program had expanded and improved, compared to the situation at Mzia’s site. Other promotional material available online shows trainees using commercial coffee machines. Despite her complaints, the situation was vastly different at Mzia’s “coffee school”, the inquiry heard. She told the inquiry that participants would need to carry a bucket of hot water across the office space to a kitchenette because the coffee training area did not have a sink. In October 2019, Mzia was found to need three months of stress leave by her doctor. She briefly returned to work in January, but said she quit in March 2020 after her requests for a position description were not met. “The uncertainty was impacting my health,” she said. Shortly after, BusyBeans was suspended due to Covid. After only 12 months in operation, the federal government had paid $874,832 in “outcome payments”, more than $111,000 in wage subsidies and a $313,000 grant to establish several “coffee schools”. By then, there were 167 paid participants and 38 “unpaid work experience” participants. Mzia told the royal commission the experience had left her with a “broken heart” and a “broken life”. “I do not want anyone to go through an abusive, badly structured system of Centrelink and … job providers and these companies that say they are going to support people with disability,” she said. “Because what you see on the outside, I tell you, is not what’s happening on the inside.” The inquiry continues. Mzia is a pseudonym provided by the royal commission.

2/27/2022,"Extreme weather has buffeted Australia’s east coast over the past few days, with five people dying in floods in Queensland and New South Wales. Records show that Sydney has experienced its wettest summer in 30 years, and the most humid in a decade. The current La Niña weather pattern is typically associated with increased rainfall across northern and eastern Australia. But in New South Wales, La Niña isn’t the only reason for the continuing heavy rainfall – so why has summer been so dreary and muggy? As of 8pm on Friday, Sydney had recorded 570mm of rain over December, January and February, according to Weatherzone data. It is the highest seasonal total in three decades, since the summer of 1991–92, which had a total rainfall of 665mm. Ben Domensino, a meteorologist at Weatherzone, says the monthly average for February is typically in the vicinity of 120mm. “We’ve had more than a month’s rain just in the last 48 hours,” he said on Thursday. In 164 years of records, Domensino said there were only 21 summers when Sydney had recorded more than half a metre of rain. Preliminary data showed the city was also experiencing its most humid summer since 2011-12, Domensino said. The finding was based on the differences between two measures – “dry-bulb temperature” (the true air temperature) and “wet-bulb temperature” (which is measured by a thermometer covered in a water-moistened cloth). Relative humidity – the amount of moisture in the air at a given temperature – has also been higher. The average relative humidity at 9am in Sydney in February this year has been 82%, compared to a historical average of 74%. The same reading at 3pm has been 68%, compared to a historical average of 64%. “We are talking five to 10 percentage points above average,” Domensino said, emphasising that relative humidity does not take temperature into account. In cooler air, the same amount of water vapour results in a higher relative humidity than at warmer temperatures. The wet and humid summer is partly attributable to the current La Niña. But Domensino said every La Niña is different in terms of how it impacts Australia. “Even weak La Niñas can cause very wet summers in Australia and strong La Niñas don’t necessarily correlate with rainfall,” he said. “We have had stronger La Niñas in the past, including the back-to-back La Niñas that occurred in 2010 to 2012. “The rainfall in Sydney from this summer is heavier than we saw during the 2010 to 2012 La Niña event.” For Sydney and other parts of NSW, there’s also a separate phenomenon at play: unusually warm sea surface temperatures in the Tasman Sea, off Australia’s east coast. “When you’ve got warm surface temperatures it causes more evaporation – it puts more moisture in the atmosphere and then that fuels rainfall,” Domensino said. For NSW, the wet conditions are likely to continue into autumn, as the marine heatwave in the Tasman Sea persists. “The models are suggesting that we are more likely than not going to see above-average rain in March for eastern New South Wales. In April, that signal is still there as well,” Domensino said. He added that in Queensland, where sea surface temperatures off the central Queensland coast and over the southern Coral Sea have been closer to average, La Niña was likely to be the dominant climate driver. According to the Bureau of Meteorology’s latest climate outlook, released on Thursday: “March to May rainfall is likely to be above median for large areas of Australia.” Dr Nina Ridder, a research associate at the University of NSW’s Climate Change Research Centre, said “already with climate change, we see more heavy rainfall events, and the rainfall events themselves become more intense”. The centre’s climate models show global warming will lead to more heavy rainfall events, even in areas that are on average drier than normal. “That has a lot to do with the ability of the atmosphere to hold more water when it is warmer,” Ridder said. “For each degree that the atmosphere warms, it can hold about 7% more water vapour.” The extent of flooding this summer has been “a lot higher than what we would have expected”, she added. “That is because we already had a La Niña last year … all the soils [are saturated] and water reservoirs are full, basically.”",News/Australia news,"Rain, rain, go away: how long will NSW and Queensland’s record wet and humid weather last?",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/27/rain-rain-go-away-how-long-will-nsw-and-queenslands-record-wet-and-humid-weather-last
2/27/2022,"It was 259 days ago that Mathias Jensen came on for Denmark against Finland at the Euros, replacing Christian Eriksen, who had been carried away on a stretcher an hour and three-quarters earlier having suffered a cardiac arrest. That substitution was leant poignancy by its banality, an ordinary act in extraordinary circumstances. What nobody realised then was that it was a substitution that would echo forward as well as back: it was Jensen who went off on Saturday as Eriksen made his return to football, the sort of coincidence that hints at wider patterns and things that are meant to be. “If you take away the result, I’m one happy man,” said Eriksen. “To go through what I’ve been through, being back is a wonderful feeling. It’s been very special since day one. Brentford have taken good care of me. Everyone’s been really happy about it and everyone’s been really helpful.” Just as Denmark’s defeat to Finland last June felt almost irrelevant, so another setback for Brentford paled beside Eriksen’s return. For him, this was a day of mixed relief and celebration, for all he spoke of the need not to be “naive” about the defeat. “Everyone is here,” he said. “My family, my parents, my kids, my mother-in-law and some doctors who have been helping me back and forth. What they’ve been through is even tougher than what I’ve been through.” What felt especially horrifying about what happened in Copenhagen was how ordinary it all appeared. A bright day, a pristine pitch, two sets of fans optimistic with the possibilities of a new tournament, but there, in a corner, screened by his teammates, a stricken Eriksen who, in his own words, “was gone from this world for five minutes”. Et in arcadia ego. If there was a sense that day that death lurks even in the brightest, most positive atmospheres, there was a feeling on Saturday that hope can also exist in the everyday environment of a relegation battle played out in a low February sun. Football can be a horrible game at times, played in a constant fug of tribal anger, but there are also occasions on which it is upliftingly sentimental. Everybody – Brentford fans troubled by their slump in form, Newcastle fans revelling in their longest unbeaten run in 11 years – rose to salute Eriksen’s return. In the immediate aftermath of his collapse, all that mattered was whether he lived or died. Details came in scraps of rumours. A photographer had seen him raise a hand as he was taken away on a stretcher. A doctor had raised an optimistic thumb. A spokesman from the nearby hospital said he was critical but stable. Then his manager told a Danish radio station that Eriksen was out of immediate danger and talking to his wife and father. That he might play again at the time was not even a consideration. But Eriksen has been able to return thanks to the Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) he had fitted a few days after his collapse. A slim device a little over two inches long, the ICD can send an electrical impulse to the heart if required. Until relatively recently, people with ICDs were advised not to undertake exercise more strenuous than a brisk walk, but a Yale University study revealed that, although 10% of the 440 athletes they researched required a shock while participating in sport, the ICD worked in every case and none suffered any ill-effects. Eriksen had to leave Inter because the regulations of the Italian Football Federation will not allow players with ICDs to play, although a number of players, most notably Ajax’s Daley Blind, have successfully played with ICDs. Although it would be unfair to expect too much, Brentford could be the beneficiaries. There were a couple of neat passes but also some moments of ponderousness and occasions when his touch failed him. But that’s only natural; any player returning after almost nine months out would take time to rediscover their form. There is little doubt Brentford, who have scored four goals in their past eight games, need his creativity. Eriksen knows how far he still has to go. Having got over the enormous hurdle of getting back on the pitch, his aim now, he said, is “first of all to get the feeling and touch back, that football feeling – and to help Brentford stay in the Premier League.”",Sport/Football,Christian Eriksen returns to a fond ovation and a wonderful coincidence,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/feb/26/christian-eriksen-brentford-football-return-fond-ovation-wonderful-coincidence
2/27/2022,"The search for consistency goes on for Scotland, and the agony of it was writ large across the demeanour and words of Stuart Hogg after their 36-17 humbling at home to France. “It’s a horrible feeling,” the Scotland captain said. “I’m not going to lie. We want to be able to give a true reflection of ourselves and what we’re about. At times we showed that, but just not enough.” Scotland were enterprising in the first half, albeit after falling two tries behind within a little more than 10 minutes of kick-off, but they let slip a couple of golden opportunities, the most glaring when Hogg himself spilled a long pass just before half-time. “I’m gutted with that one,” he said. “I let one go, which could have changed the whole momentum of the game. It’s something I’m absolutely devastated with. It is what it is. For us it’s about hard truths, hard lessons about where we’re at as a team. France took their opportunities and that’s the difference in the scoreline right now. It’s absolutely horrible.” Hogg’s fumble before half-time was a turning point but the real story was the quality of France, who were ruthless with their finishing. Gregor Townsend rates them as the strongest France team he has faced as coach of Scotland. “We know their strengths, but it’s their ability to turn good ball into tries. Their backline is strong, and the scrum-half obviously is a very good player. But the thing that stands out is their front five, their ability to carry and keep the ball alive. They’re very clinical close to the tryline. A massive tradition of French rugby is the way the players react to space. They’re up there with the All Blacks as being the best at exploiting that turnover ball.” More ominous still for the rest of the championship is the way France seemed to take this resounding win in their stride. Raphaël Ibañez, the team manager, almost shrugged when asked to rate it. “We all think it was a pretty good performance,” he said. “The team responded well. It was our first away game in this Six Nations. For the team it’s just another step towards the Six Nations. We know we still have room for improvement.” One other notable feature of France’s win was the vocal contribution of their travelling fans. “There had been a long, long period without winning matches,” said Antoine Dupont, purveyor of yet another scintillating display, “and now we haven’t won the tournament for 12 years. We have to be careful not to be complacent and to remain very rigorous, very demanding, so that we can go on giving the most of ourselves for the supporters.”",Sport/Sport,‘Horrible feeling’: Stuart Hogg laments hard truths in Scotland defeat,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/26/horrible-feeling-stuart-hogg-laments-hard-truths-in-scotland-defeat
