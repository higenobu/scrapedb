3/19/2022,"By Daren Butler ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan opened a massive suspension bridge across Turkey's Dardanelles Strait on Friday, the latest in a series of major infrastructure projects which he has prioritised during his two decades in power. Connecting Turkey's European and Asian shores, the 1915 Canakkale Bridge was built by Turkish and South Korean firms with an investment of 2.5 billion euros ($2.8 billion). It has the longest main span - the distance between the two towers - of any suspension bridge in the world. Such mega projects have been central to Erdogan's achievements since his AK Party first came to power in 2002, including a new Istanbul airport, rail and road tunnels beneath Istanbul's Bosphorus strait, and a bridge over it. ""These works will continue to provide profit for the state for many years,"" Erdogan said at an opening ceremony on the anniversary of a 1915 Ottoman naval victory against French and British forces in the Dardanelles during World War One. ""These projects have a large share in putting our country ahead in investment, workforce and exports,"" he said. Last year he launched what he previously called his ""crazy project"": a $15 billion canal in Istanbul intended to relieve pressure on the busy Bosphorus Strait. However critics have questioned the project's viability given Turkey's economic woes, environmental risks and public opposition. COSTLY Ahead of national elections scheduled for 2023, opinion polls have shown a slide in the popularity of Erdogan and his AK Party, boosting the opposition's prospects of ousting him. The main opposition CHP has criticised the potential cost of the bridge to the public purse, with media reports saying the build-operate-transfer agreement includes an annual payment guarantee of 380 million euros ($420 million) to the operators or a total 6 billion euros over the duration of the accord. Erdogan said the price for passenger vehicles to use the bridge would be 200 lira ($13.50). Work on the Dardanelles bridge project was launched in March 2017, with more than 5,000 workers involved in the construction. The 2,023 metre (1.25 mile) length of its midspan is an allusion to the Turkish Republic's 100th anniversary in 2023. It is the fourth bridge linking the European and Asian shores in Turkey, alongside the three built in Istanbul. Its towers are 318 metres (347.8 yards) high and the total length of the bridge is 4.6 km (2.9 miles) including the approach viaducts. Until now, vehicles travelling between Anatolia and the Gallipoli peninsula had to cross the Dardanelles in a one-hour ferry journey, which including waiting time amounted to as much as five hours. The journey will now take around six minutes.

3/19/2022,"After Donald Trump praised Russian despot Vladimir Putin’s mobilization of troops along the Ukrainian border and subsequent invasion of Ukraine, someone apparently got in his ear this week and convinced the former reality TV host to change his tune, saying, “I think Putin has changed. It’s a very sad thing for the world. He’s very much changed.” “At least he still has Kim Jong Un, I guess,” cracked Jimmy Kimmel on his late-night show Wednesday evening. Then the comedian went after Trump surrogate Lara Trump—“whose credentials when it comes to politics are ‘I married Eric,’” cracked Kimmel—who’s been making the media rounds attacking President Biden. “[She] was on Fox News last night to lash out at Joe Biden and put those big new lips she has on daddy-in-law’s ass,” Kimmel continued. (There are many more worthwhile things to mock than her looks, which seems like a low blow.) John Oliver Drags Disney to Hell Over ‘Don’t Say Gay’ Bill Kimmel then threw to a clip of Lara on Fox News saying, “What I’d love to know is: What is Joe Biden’s platform? What is his stump speech to the American people? What is his list of accomplishments that he can rattle off for Americans, you know, like Donald Trump, who had to put an entire website together because we couldn’t keep track of all of his accomplishments?” “Oh, that’s why he did it? I thought it was ’cause he got kicked off all the other websites,” fired back Kimmel. Read more at The Daily Beast. Get the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

3/19/2022,"Exactly 10 years ago, I was teaching a semester of economics at LCC International University in Klaipeda, Lithuania. LCC attracts students from all over the world, but especially students who hail from the former Soviet bloc countries. In my classes were students from Russia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Moldova, Kazakhstan and as far away as Nigeria. The eastern European students had been born about the time the old Soviet Union collapsed, and their parents had grown up and lived under Bolshevik domination. Their grandparents and great-grandparents, at least those who had lived to tell about it, had suffered greatly from World War II and its aftermath. One course, International Economic Relations, was a requirement of graduating business majors. In this class, it goes almost without saying, the significance of the United States in the world’s economic systems was front and center, and the conversation went well beyond pure economics. There was a general feeling of mild resentment among students that the United States presumed to be the policeman to the world. Who were we to throw our weight around? I pointed out, as if they needed to be reminded, that in the generations immediately preceding them, when America was isolationist and left the rest of the world to its own devices, the catastrophe of Hitler and Stalin had destroyed millions of lives and made miserable the lives of most of the survivors. I was surprised at some of the reactions. The consensus was those bad, old days were over. Europe was peaceful. Nobody was going to run over their neighbors any more. It was a new and better world. Their naivete and sunny optimism, I pointed out, flew in the face of 6,000 years of recorded history. Why now should the world be any different? At that point a few students, females as I recall, did worry what might happen if the U.S. stopped policing the world. I cannot specifically remember if they were Ukrainians. It was 2012 in the middle of the Obama administration, and America was in the process of withdrawing from many of its involvements started under Bush, the aftermath of 9/11, Iraq, Afghanistan and nation building. President Barack Obama, caught on a hot mic, famously told the outgoing president of Russia that he would have more “flexibility” in relations with Putin after he was re-elected. After two years of this “flexibility,” Putin took over Crimea and also started slicing off parts of eastern Ukraine. What was that to us? Ukraine was a corrupt place — corruption became a habit under Bolshevism. That’s how many people survived. As I observed in Lithuania, Europe can be a tribal place with long-simmering ethnic and nationalist tensions, so business as usual and nothing for us to get concerned about. No matter how necessary, there are a number of drawbacks to policing. From small towns to major cities, to a nation, policing is dangerous. Cops die, soldiers die. Policing costs money — lots of money. U.S. law enforcement costs over $200 billion a year: with military spending — a trillion dollars per year. There is also a certain negative frisson when in the presence of heavily armed uniformed persons who could, under the right circumstances, shoot you. The politics of “defund the police” makes a certain amount of sense, but the result of that over the past few years has been a spike in crime and disorder. Most people don’t like riots, even if they are “mostly peaceful.” President Joe Biden, in his State of the Union address, recognizing a sure political loser, stated it was time to “fund the police.” If Biden can abandon a bad policy in this country, can he abandon a bad policy with respect to the rest of the world? It is a sad fact, both here and around the world, bad actors will prey upon the weak and defenseless. We’ve made some awful policy decisions, and the Ukrainians are paying the price. Unless we decide to shoulder our, admittedly unwanted, responsibilities, Ukrainians won't be the last.
