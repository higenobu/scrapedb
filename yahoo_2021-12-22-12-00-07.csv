12/22/2021,"BOSTON (AP) — A Harvard University professor charged with hiding his ties to a Chinese-run recruitment program was found guilty on all counts Tuesday. Charles Lieber, 62, the former chair of Harvard’s department of chemistry and chemical biology, had pleaded not guilty to two counts of filing false tax returns, two counts of making false statements, and two counts of failing to file reports for a foreign bank account in China. The jury deliberated for about two hours and 45 minutes before announcing the verdict following five days of testimony in Boston federal court. Lieber’s defense attorney Marc Mukasey had argued that prosecutors lacked proof of the charges. He maintained that investigators didn’t keep any record of their interviews with Lieber prior to his arrest. He argued that prosecutors would be unable to prove that Lieber acted “knowingly, intentionally, or willfully, or that he made any material false statement.” Mukasey also stressed Lieber wasn't charged with illegally transferring any technology or proprietary information to China. Prosecutors argued that Lieber, who was arrested in January, knowingly hid his involvement in China’s Thousand Talents Plan — a program designed to recruit people with knowledge of foreign technology and intellectual property to China — to protect his career and reputation. Lieber denied his involvement during inquiries from U.S. authorities, including the National Institutes of Health, which had provided him with millions of dollars in research funding, prosecutors said. Lieber also concealed his income from the Chinese program, including $50,000 a month from the Wuhan University of Technology, up to $158,000 in living expenses and more than $1.5 million in grants, according to prosecutors. In exchange, they say, Lieber agreed to publish articles, organize international conferences and apply for patents on behalf of the Chinese university. The case is among the highest profile to come from the U.S. Department of Justice’s so-called “China Initiative.” The effort launched in 2018 to curb economic espionage from China has faced criticism that it harms academic research and amounts to racial profiling of Chinese researchers. Hundreds of faculty members at Stanford, Yale, Berkeley, Princeton, Temple and other prominent colleges have signed onto letters to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland calling on him to end the initiative. The academics say the effort compromises the nation’s competitiveness in research and technology and has had a chilling effect on recruiting foreign scholars. The letters also complain the investigations have disproportionally targeted researchers of Chinese origin. Lieber has been on paid administrative leave from Harvard since being arrested in January 2020.",U.S./Associated Press,Harvard professor found guilty of hiding ties to China,https://news.yahoo.com/harvard-professor-found-guilty-hiding-003242174.html
12/22/2021,"DC police officer Michael Fanone was beaten unconscious by rioters at the Capitol on January 6. He resigned Monday and will leave the department on December 31, The Washington Post reported. Fanone, who made extensive media appearances, is due to join CNN as an on-air contributor in 2022. The DC Metropolitan Police police officer beaten by Capitol rioters resigned on Monday, The Washington Post reported. He is due to take up a new job at CNN as an on-air contributor. Michael Fanone was knocked unconscious and badly injured in the attack at the Capitol and later appeared on cable news shows to warn of what he called the threat to democracy posed by people like the rioters. Fanone, who says he now suffers with PTSD, recounted the attack in detail during his testimony in July before Congress' January 6 commission. He said he was ""grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country."" He said his badge and equipment were stolen and he heard his attackers shout: ""Kill him with his own gun."" A still from Fanone's bodycam, included by the Justice Department in court filings, showed Fanone being mobbed by men. The circled man, Thomas Sibick, is accused of attacking Fanone and stealing his badge. In one memorable appearance not long after January 6, Fanone discussed the rioters who helped protect him when others wanted to harm him, giving them the message: ""Thank you, but fuck you for being there."" On Monday, Fanone told The Post he resigned and would become a contributor for CNN on law-enforcement issues in the new year. Brain Stelter, CNN's chief media correspondent, tweeted Monday that the network had confirmed the appointment. Fanone's appearances in Congress and on cable news drew scorn from his colleagues, he told The Post. ""Clearly there are some members of our department who feel their oath is to Donald Trump and not to the Constitution,"" Fanone said. ""I no longer felt like I could trust my fellow officers and decided it was time to make a change."" Fanone, who has been a police officer for two decades, returned to limited duty for the first time in September after several months of absence, The Post said. His last day as a police officer is due to be December 31. Fanone said that on his return he was assigned to a division that analyzes statistics, ignoring his preference to work at a training academy. He told the Post that he felt his commanders were trying to hide him from colleagues who disapproved of his media profile. Fanone told the newspaper there are now only two current DC police officers he counts as friends.
