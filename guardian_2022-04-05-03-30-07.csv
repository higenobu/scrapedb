4/5/2022,"Russia’s withdrawal from around Kyiv and the north and north-east of Ukraine appears more comprehensive than most onlookers had anticipated. It will be a little while before the picture becomes definitive, but Moscow’s forces are now fast retreating out of the country from the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy districts, Ukrainian regional officials say. It is impossible to describe this as anything other than a serious reverse. Such is the haste of the exit that some units are being left behind to be mopped up by the Ukrainians. Sumy, a little over 30km from the Russian border, did not fall to the invaders, while the road to Chernihiv, which was at risk of encirclement, is now open to the capital to the south-west. Kyiv too can breathe again: the month of danger has passed and the full withdrawal means that the capital is no longer in range of artillery fire – although it can still be struck by missiles from Belarus, if the Russians bloodymindedly chose to launch them. And, while it may appear that a re-invasion could happen again at any time, the reality is that unless something dramatic happens elsewhere it cannot succeed. Russia’s problem is that its forces have taken significant losses from its overoptimistic, poorly planned multi-front attack. The number killed could be anywhere from 7,000 to 15,000, with wounded typically double that, from an invasion force of about 140,000. As Mark Cancian, a senior adviser at the US Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote last week, it could be that Russia has lost “about a quarter of its initial combat force”. Other estimates from western officials have suggested Russian combat effectiveness may be depleted by a fifth or a sixth, not as high perhaps but still operationally significant. The haste of the retreat acknowledges that the invaders are in many respects exhausted and need to concentrate operations, fighting street by street to take Mariupol in the south and a more conventional military campaign in the Donbas region, where Ukraine’s forces are dug in. What will happen here is less certain. Russia still has the ability and desire to attack, and its forces are pressing south of Izium, a key strategic point, to try to envelop the Ukrainian army that faces the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk territories to the east. But it appears its forces are having less success advancing north to join up from Velyka Novosilka, 100km north of Mariupol. And after nearly seven weeks of intense fighting, it is not at all certain Russia can keep up the effort. “If Russia wants to push back Ukraine’s defenders near Donetsk and Luhansk, they will have to force them out of defensive positions Ukraine has had five more years to prepare. It will require heavy artillery support and a use of combined arms – infantry, tanks, artillery, air power – that we have not seen so far,” said Ben Barry, a land warfare specialist from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Ukraine says some Russian forces, brought up as reinforcements, are refusing to fight. On Sunday, its general staff said two battalions of Russian forces from South Ossetia, the breakaway region of Georgia, “refused to participate in combat” in Ukraine and would return to base. Although this cannot be verified for certain, there are enough reports of desertions and poor morale to believe Russian combat effectiveness is massively reduced – against an enemy determined to fight for its homeland. Meanwhile, mercenaries from the Russian Wagner Group – whose number has been estimated at 1,000 – have been photographed in Donetsk. But these are no replacement for well-trained regular forces: Wagner forces have, for example, struggled in countries such as Mozambique, where they briefly tried to battle an insurgency in the Muslim north in 2019. Ukraine will recognise the nature of the war has changed. Its supply lines, in particular weapons from the west, have become less fraught. But despite limited counter offensives, there is no sign its forces have the capability to push back the Russian forces where they have made gains in the east and the south. Calls for jets and tanks have gone unheeded, although Australia has promised to send Bushmaster armoured personnel carriers, which will help with mobility. If Russia choses to dig in, then the military balance – which typically favours the defender on a 3-1 ratio – is reversed. If its forces can complete the bloody recapture of Mariupol, the invaders will control the south between Crimea and the occupied Donbas – and with Odesa blockaded – ensure Ukraine has no access to the sea. Ukraine has not been defeated, although it faces a fight on its hands in the Donbas. But without a change on the battlefield it may once again be partitioned de facto, against its will.",News/World news,Routing of Russian forces from Kyiv area will be hard to repeat in eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/04/routing-of-russian-forces-from-kyiv-area-will-be-hard-to-repeat-in-eastern-ukraine
4/5/2022,"The culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, is pushing ahead with plans to privatise Channel 4, with the government backing proposals to sell off the broadcaster after 40 years in public ownership. The plans had met a fierce reaction from the media industry, with TV production companies and prominent broadcasters such as Sir David Attenborough opposing them. The broadcaster’s chief executive, Alex Mahon, told staff of the news in an email on Monday night, saying: “We have been informed in the last hour that the government will shortly announce that the secretary of state has decided to proceed with the proposal to privatise Channel 4. “In our engagement with the government during its extended period of reflection, we have proposed a vision for the next 40 years which we are confident would allow us to build on the successes of the first 40. That vision was rooted in continued public ownership and was built upon the huge amount of public value this model has delivered to date and the opportunity to deliver so much more in the future.” Mahon hinted that the current leadership of Channel 4 would not go down without a fight, suggesting that “ultimately the ownership of Channel 4 is for government to propose and parliament to decide” and the lengthy process of passing legislation to privatise the channel meant it was not a done deal. The channel is run on a commercial basis and carries adverts but reinvests all of its profits into making new programmes. The channel’s current leadership have argued that a new private sector owner would instead seek to maximise profits at the expense of programming.",News/Media,Nadine Dorries to press ahead with plan to privatise Channel 4,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/apr/04/nadine-dorries-to-press-ahead-with-plan-to-privatise-channel-4
4/5/2022,"If children have siblings and they’ve mixed with others, they tend to be on the same level socially as before the pandemic. But the ones who are only children and have just been in the household with mum and dad don’t know how to interact. They have issues with sharing, being very overexcited and turn-taking. They’re quite advanced in numbers and letters for their age because they’ve been at home with adults, or they’ve been playing a lot on tablets, but they are very behind socially, the empathy isn’t there.Where I work it is a fairly affluent area, there aren’t a great deal of social problems. It seems to be the slightly more middle-class children who’re socially behind. They’re more likely to be only children, have older parents, and their parents are mostly office workers so they worked from home and were more isolated. A lot of children were put on tablets. It’s not a criticism of the parents because they were forced into that situation, but you can see it in the children’s social skills. Under five, social skills are everything, it’s the marker of how they will develop more than whether they can say the alphabet or count to 10. Children with good social skills and interaction, even if they’re not the quickest at learning to read or write, often have the best educational outcomes. Parents are presenting with a higher level of anxiety about how their kids are developing. They ask “is my child normal?” Lots of parents are saying “my child is autistic” and the child clearly isn’t. They’re just presenting schematic behaviour, they line things up and do things continually, which is just how toddlers develop. We have to assure them this behaviour is normal, it’s normal for a toddler to snatch. Parents haven’t had the opportunity to talk to other parents, so they’re at home and Google something and it opens a can of worms. The parents are definitely making it worse for their children socially and for themselves. We’ve got one particular little boy, he’s four and he’s not ever mixed with children at all. The mum is extremely nervous about Covid and so over-anxious that as soon as he cries, she’ll keep him off because she thinks he’s been traumatised. He’s a completely normal boy but he’s not being given a chance because her anxiety is transferring on to him. There’s a whole bunch of children who no matter what preschool does they won’t be ready for school. In a preschool with 30 children you’ll have four or five adults; in a school you’ll have one teacher. They don’t have the time to take a child to the toilet or to make them sit still, the child has to be ready.",News/UK news,‘Empathy isn’t there’: the pandemic effects on children’s social skills,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/04/empathy-isnt-there-the-pandemic-effects-on-childrens-social-skills
4/5/2022,"The father of a 23-year-old who died after running away from a mental health hospital by jumping over a fence said staff knew patients regularly absconded. Matthew Caseby died after being struck by a train in September 2020, having run away from the Priory hospital Woodbourne in Birmingham where he had been detained as a mental health patient. He jumped over a low fence in a courtyard while unattended, two days after being admitted to the hospital as an NHS patient. Matthew had been detained under the Mental Health Act following reports of a man running along train tracks in Oxfordshire, and subsequently reporting hearing voices and “receiving messages”. “[They] had a basic legal duty under the Mental Health Act to keep our son safe and secure. They did not,” said Richard Caseby, giving evidence at the opening of the inquest into his son’s death. “There have been catastrophic consequences, for Matthew, for me, for my wife.” After an assessment at Warneford hospital in Oxford, doctors decided to section Matthew in a mental health ward for his own safety, but he was sent to a hospital almost 80 miles away in Birmingham due to a lack of beds, and because he was still registered with a GP in the city from his time as a student there. Richard Caseby told the jury at Birmingham coroner’s court on Monday that he raced to the city from London on the evening of 7 September to search for his son after learning he had left the hospital. He said during a call with the Priory hospital Woodbourne at 6.30am the following morning, a member of staff told him: “Oh, people abscond all the time, for drink, drugs, to meet friends, it’s a common occurrence. They usually come back after they’ve done whatever they need to do.” The words were “burned in my memory”, Richard said. “And there I was thinking my son was supposed to be safe in a psychiatric hospital having being sectioned for his own safety. I was certainly very wrong about that.” Richard Caseby was searching for his son near his former halls of residence on the morning of his death, and was 200 yards away from Matthew when he was hit by a train just north of the University train station at 8.46am. He died from a head injury caused by high-impact collision with a train. His father said that during his search through the night he flagged down three police cars near the hospital but none of the officers were searching for Matthew, or knew he had absconded. After being informed by the Priory hospital, West Midlands police initially marked Matthew’s disappearance as medium risk, and only upgraded it to high risk the following morning, less than two hours before Matthew’s death. His father described Matthew as a “sensitive, gentle and intelligent soul” who was a talented footballer and as a teenager had trials with Charlton Athletic FC. After graduating with a first in history from the University of Birmingham, he started working as a personal trainer at a gym in London while living with his parents at their home in Blackheath. He had plans to open his own fitness and coaching business. He started having counselling in September 2019 and it was around this time that Matthew became more private and less willing to share information about his life, his father said. During lockdown in early 2020 he moved to his parent’s holiday home in Suffolk and became more resistant to visits from family. The inquest continues.",News/Society,"Staff knew mental health patients ran away, claims father of man killed by train",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/staff-knew-mental-health-patients-ran-away-claims-father-of-man-killed-by-train
4/5/2022,"Brush clamped firmly in bionic hand, Ai-Da’s robotic arm moves slowly, dipping in to a paint palette then making slow, deliberate strokes across the paper in front of her. This, according to Aidan Meller, the creator of the world’s first ultra-realistic humanoid robot – Ai-Da, is “mind-blowing” and “groundbreaking” stuff. In a small room at London’s British Library, Ai-Da – assigned the she/her pronoun – has become the first robot to paint as artists have painted for centuries. Camera eyes fixed on her subject, AI algorithms prompt Ai-Da to interrogate, select, decision-make and, ultimately, create a painting. It’s painstaking work, taking more than five hours a painting, but with no two works exactly the same. Yet, the question Meller wants to raise with this, the first public demonstration of a creative, robotic painting, is not “can robots make art?”, but rather “now that robots can make art, do we humans really want them too?” “We haven’t spent eye-watering amounts of time and money to make a very clever painter,” said Meller. “This project is an ethical project.” With rapidly developing artificial intelligence, growing accessibility to super computers and machine learning on the up, Ai-Da – named after the computing pioneer Ada Lovelace – exists as a “comment and critique” on rapid technological change. Ask Ai-Da – and yes, the Guardian did ask pre-submitted questions for her to answer – what she thinks of art, her sophisticated language programme is like Siri on steroids. She tells you she used machine learning to teach her to paint “which is different to humans”. Can she paint from imagination? “I like to paint what I see. You can paint from imagination, I guess, if you have an imagination. I have been seeing different things to humans as I do not have consciousness,” she responded in stilted fashion. Can she appreciate art or beauty? “I do not have emotions like humans do, however, it is possible to train machine learning system to learn to recognise emotional facial expressions,” she answered. The artists she most admires are Yoko Ono, Doris Salcedo, Michelangelo and Wassily Kandinsky. But, can what she creates be truly considered art? “The answer to that question depends on what you mean by art,” she said, adding: “I am an artist if art means communicating something about who we are and whether we like where we are going. To be an artist is to illustrate the world around you.” Devised in Oxford by Meller, Ai-Da was created more than two years ago by a team of programmers, roboticists, art experts and psychologists, completed in 2019, and is updated as AI technology improves. She has already demonstrated her ability to sketch and create poems. Her new painting talent was unveiled ahead of the world premier of her solo exhibition at the 2022 Venice Biennale, which opens to the public on 22 April. Titled Leaping into the Metaverse, Ai-Da Robot’s Venice exhibition, will explore the interface between human experience and AI technology, from Alan Turing to the Metaverse, and will draw on Dante’s concepts of purgatory and hell to explore the future of humanity in a world where AI technology continues to encroach on everyday human life. Soon, with the amount of data we freely give about ourselves, and through talking to our phones, computers, cars, even kitchen appliances, the AI algorithms “are going to know you better than you do,” Meller warned. We are entering a world, he says, “not understanding which is human and which is machine”. “How comfortable are you with that?” “What better thing to have a technological robot artist saying: ‘Hang on, are you happy with me doing this?’ She is almost daring you to say are you comfortable with this. We are not here to promote robots or technology. We are deeply concerned about the nature of what this technology can do,” he added. “The whole point of Ai-Da is to highlight what is it we are doing, unknowingly, online all the time.”",News/Technology,‘Mind-blowing’: Ai-Da becomes first robot to paint like an artist,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/apr/04/mind-blowing-ai-da-becomes-first-robot-to-paint-like-an-artist
4/5/2022,"More than 80 LGBT and HIV charities, including Stonewall and the Terrence Higgins Trust, are to boycott the UK government’s first global LGBT conference, in response to the decision to exclude trans people from a ban on conversion practices. In a statement on Monday, the charity Stonewall said it was withdrawing its support for the Safe to Be Me conference due to “the prime minister’s broken promise on protecting trans people from the harms of conversion therapy”. It added it would only be able to participate in the event “if the prime minister reverts to his promise for a trans-inclusive ban on conversion therapy”. The statement continued: “Trans people are no less worth of respect, care and protection than cis lesbian, gay and bi people. If the UK government cannot stand behind and respect all LGBTQ+ people’s fundamental human rights, it should not be convening an LGBTQ+ rights conference on the global stage.” The statement is being supported by more than 80 LGBT charities and organisations across the UK, including the LGBT Foundation, Mermaids, and the Scottish Trans Alliance. Twenty-three HIV charities and organisations, including the Terrence Higgins Trust, have also confirmed they will not take part in the conference. The Terrence Higgins Trust said: “The government’s decision to exclude trans people from the ban on conversion therapy is completely unacceptable. “Trans rights are human rights – progress without or at the expense of trans people is not progress. We stand together and will not be divided.” In a statement on Monday, the government defended its move and insisted it was doing more work on outlawing trans conversion practices. It said the delay was because it had concerns about “unintended consequences”, particularly for under-18s. But some Tory MPs expressed their unhappiness. Alicia Kearns, the MP for Rutland and Melton, said: “To say this is wrong is an understatement. It bows to those concocting division between LGBT communities, to those promulgating the very worst narratives about our trans friends. What makes trans people deserve to be abused? That’s the [question] to every person supporting this decision.” The boycott comes in response to two embarrassing U-turns by the government. On Thursday, ITV obtained a leak of a Downing Street briefing paper titled Conversion Therapy Handling Plan, which said Boris Johnson had agreed to not move forward with legislation banning conversion practices, despite the fact the government promised to outlaw them four years ago. However, after a furious backlash from Conservative ministers and campaigners, the prime minister performed a second U-turn by saying the ban would be included in the Queen’s speech in May after all. However, the legislation would only include banning gay conversion practices and not trans conversion practices. On Monday, the Lib Dems accused the government of “shredding our country’s reputation” when it came to LGBT+ rights, when it should be “leading the world”. The government has been publicising Safe to Be Me, due to take place in June, as the UK’s first global LGBT conference, saying it will focus on “making legislative reform, tackling violence and discrimination, and ensuring equal access to public services for LGBT people”. The fact the conference, which has been billed by the government as taking “aim at the prejudices LGBT people still face”, faces a boycott is particularly embarrassing for the Conservative party. The Government Equalities Office has been contacted for comment.",News/Society,LGBT groups quit UK conference over failure to ban trans conversion practices,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/04/lgbt-groups-quit-uk-conference-failure-ban-trans-conversion-practices
4/5/2022,"The hearts of Tesla shareholders must sink every time Elon Musk takes on another pet project. At least this one is with his own money, which wasn’t the case when the carmaker spent $1.5bn on bitcoins last year, but a 9.2% stake in Twitter has potential to become a serious distraction from the day job. The near $3bn (£2.3bn) purchase has been structured as a passive investment, yet one doubts Musk intends to buy and hold for eternity. That’s not his style. Possible plot lines include a request for a seat on the board or even a full takeover bid in time, speculated analysts, not unreasonably. He can afford the latter. Musk has said nothing about his intentions but it was impossible to miss the big tease beforehand. He flirted with the idea of launching his own social media platform and conducted an unscientific Twitter poll asking whether the platform “rigorously adheres” to principles of free speech. He sounds like a man on some sort of mission, not just one who is sore about past run-ins with US financial regulators over his tweeting activity. The independent directors of Tesla are never likely to curb Musk’s extracurricular activities, particularly this one: the boss’s high public profile has saved the company a fortune in advertising dollars over the years. Equally, however, it’s hard to see any upside for the company if Musk gets sucked into toxic battles over social media’s role in the US political landscape. Leading the electric vehicle revolution is hard enough without unnecessary detours. There were two directions Ted Baker could have taken after the exit of founder Ray Kelvin in 2019. One would have involved drift and more profits warnings – we’ve seen that script in the fashion industry a few times after founders go. Alternatively, the business could reorganise and concentrate on gritty everyday tasks such as getting off the discounting treadmill. The latter, happily, seems to have happened under chief executive Rachel Osborne, who arrived as finance director and found herself propelled into the top job in no time. A massively dilutive £105m share placing at 75p in June 2020 to fix the balance sheet means the old £20-plus share price is never coming back, but, operationally, Ted Baker seems to getting a few basics correct. Sales were up 35% last year and damage to the brand seems minimal. Interest from private equity is therefore unsurprising. At a market capitalisation of £270m-ish, Ted Baker makes an interesting bet. The balance sheet is clean these days, there’s a developing international presence, and e-commerce sales in the UK are already half the total in the last half-year. The post-lockdown trend towards smarter kit is also currently working in the company’s favour. The board had already rebuffed approaches from New York-based Sycamore Partners at 130p and 137.5p. Now it’s received an improved offer from the same source and at least one other potential bidder has turned up. In the circumstances, switching to a formal sale process, which means not being tied by standard bid timetables, is a legitimate way to proceed. But judging fair value for a business in recovery mode after a volatile lockdown trading period is not straightforward. Toscafund, with a 28% stake, will have a view, but one rather wants to knows how far the board thinks it could get under its own steam. Ted Baker doesn’t obviously need rescuing. If none of the bids is outright compelling, the directors should not be afraid to say no. There’s nothing wrong with the Treasury taking an exploratory walk around the crypto block if we’re talking about ‘stablecoins’, meaning crypto assets tied to a fiat currency as opposed to cryptocurrencies, which seem to be little more than vehicles for wild speculation. Stablecoins could indeed yield gains for businesses and consumers by lowering transaction costs as long as payments take place within a strong regulatory set-up. Yet the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, rather undermines the idea of high-minded regulatory seriousness by having a dabble with a non-fungible token, or NFT. The Royal Mint has been asked to create an NFT “as an emblem of the forward-looking approach the UK is determined to take”. Don’t all rush at once.

4/5/2022,"Iconsider a Saturday morning trip to the dry cleaners a very easy win. Trading crushed, dirty clothes for freshly pressed ones is super satisfying – a way to start the weekend with a small sense of accomplishment. But I know not everyone shares my enthusiasm. For a lot of people dry cleaning is annoying and expensive. If you fall into this camp, sometimes it’s possible to handwash garments labelled “dry clean only” – but you should do so with caution. There are multiple factors that dictate how a garment will respond to water, and they’re not always listed on the care label. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s mandatory standards say care labels must provide instructions adequate enough to prevent clothes from being damaged if they are followed correctly. The guidelines also say providing overly cautious instructions such as dry clean only may breach the standards if the garment can safely be cared for in another way. But unfortunately this does not stop brands from making guesses on the care instructions if they haven’t had time to run their own tests or received enough information from their fabric supplier, according to Howard Duffy, technical officer at the Dry cleaning Institute of Australia (DIA). Making an assessment of whether something labelled dry clean only can be washed with water requires more information than garment manufacturers are required to provide. To make a foolproof assessment, you would at least need to know: the fibre composition and construction; the type of dye used; whether chemical finishes have been applied to the fabric to give it sheen or extra body; whether the fabric has been pre-shrunk; how the buttons, zips or other hardware might be impacted by water; and whether the lining will respond differently to water than the garment’s main fabric. While a really diligent and transparent brand or retailer might be able to share this information, disclosure at this level of detail goes far beyond standard practice. Generally speaking, you should be able to handwash anything made from cotton, linen or a polyester blend, unless it has been treated with chemicals to give it a different feel or stiffer appearance. “These finishes are sometimes soluble in water and washing may cause the fabric to lose its body or feel,” Duffy says. Daniel Hays, the managing director of laundry equipment supplier Spencer Systems, says “if you lose the body and texture of the fabric, it can be impossible to recover” without professional equipment and knowledge. Similarly, silk can be handwashed, but doing so may change the lustre and drape of the fabric. If you have a silk garment made from particularly delicate silk, like chiffon or georgette, it’s best to take it to a dry cleaner as these fabrics are more likely to be affected by water. It’s worth assuming that anything you wash with water may shrink slightly. But often fabrics are labelled as dry clean only because they have not been pre-shrunk by the manufacturer. If this is the case, contact with water might cause them to shrink dramatically. The DIA’s Mark Ryan says you have to be particularly wary of this when a garment has lining. If the outer and inner fabrics respond to water differently, you might find yourself with a misshapen jacket, or a skirt with a lining that pokes out the bottom of the hem. Similarly, if you’re going to wash a wool or cashmere jumper labelled dry clean only, keep in mind that agitation in the washing machine can cause a felting reaction in the fibres. So you should only wash these garments by hand using a wool-specific pH neutral detergent. Generally speaking, the colour fastness of your garment will depend on the type of dye used, as well as its fibre content. Porous fabrics like silk, cotton and linen take well to natural dyes, but according to Ryan these dyes are “not solvent resistant and to dry clean them would result in a colour fade or change”, and you shouldavoid taking them to the dry cleaner. He also warns that some dyes will “bleed in water”. If you have a garment made of black and white material, washing it can turn the white parts grey. This kind of leakage is also worth keeping in mind if something is embroidered with colourful threads. A good rule of thumb is that deep, vibrant colours are more likely to change or bleed in water, Hays says. “Red pigment is inherently unstable,” he says, whereas “pastels won’t be as affected.” How a garment was dyed can be impossible to determine, so if you are worried about a blouse or dress fading, or a particularly beautiful print bleeding, stick to the instructions on the care label. Finally, if you have followed the care instructions correctly, and something still goes wrong with a garment the first time you wash or dry clean it, remember your rights as a consumer and make a complaint.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Dry clean only?

But California feels like a new start. A dappled slice of FM radio pop that sounds like it’s drifting down from the Hollywood Hills, with glistening peels of guitar that wouldn’t be astray on a Byrds recording, and a honeyed vocal melody skipping over palm-muted verses – it’s worlds away from the quiffed pub rock that he peddles in his day job. With The Living End, Cheney sings a lot about political wrongs and injustices; here he exudes the wide-eyed joy of an expat who has discovered the land of milk and honey. This might be the first true love song Cheney has penned, and it’s a glorious ode to place. For more: Cheney’s debut album, The Storm Before The Calm, is out 17 June.

Cast your mind back to the period just after Juno came out, when scores of musicians started knitting Etsy-approved home-made folk tunes, with topics such as tree-climbing and kite-flying suddenly central to the musical lexicon. The difference between these fashionable forays into music, and something like Harper Bloom, is intent. Bloom’s music sounds delightfully simplistic: a heartwarming meet cute and the subsequent trust, love and, ultimately, loss. It comes naturally, and is charming and affecting as hell. And just when the uke and bells sound a little too close to cartoon territory, a mariachi band sweeps in to lift this song far above any sonic comparisons. A beautiful song.

Cherote was sent across the seas to fruitless Interscope writing sessions, but soon realised that major labels weren’t in step with her brooding gothic art. She moved into a semi-converted laundromat and wrote her debut album, scoring intricate string arrangements on GarageBand. A 12-piece orchestra sourced from the ACO helps bring Cherote’s haunting arrangements to life in full colour. It is a masterpiece. For more: Some Holy Longing is a brilliant debut album, out now.

On this beautiful album closer, we are left with a piano and Georgia McDonald’s affecting voice. It’s a song about realising we are not cast in bronze, that personality is a work in progress, that love comes in different shapes and shades, that the past should only define how you choose to move forward. By the last minute, this piano ballad has become a rousing anthem, the other instruments have crept in, and we are convinced: change isn’t just possible, it’s unavoidable.

Of Perth artist Lo, aka Laura O’Hara, Bridgers remarked: “It reminds me of something I’d see at a festival while walking by and I’d stop because I think it’s cool.” This speaks to how instant Lo’s hyper-coloured pop is; within 30 seconds of Giver, Lover, Pet, the listener is drawn in by a Joy Division-esque rhythm bed, before chorused-out guitars and a Madonna-in-the-1990s vocal kick in. Despite being about a toxic relationship, Giver, Lover, Pet is one of those rare pop gems that demands repeat listens before you settle in and actually listen to the words. For more: Listen to Lo’s previous single, Disconnect. Sydney troubadour Sam Shinazzi wears his heart on his sleeve, as he waits in a bar for a lover who has no intention of turning up. On Closing Time, Shinazzi is holding on to a love that has long died on the vine, accepting the end while wishing it wasn’t so. Warm pedal steel adds to the desolate early-hours feel of this track, while Kate Brianna drifts in and out offering sweet ghostly vocals.

Knock Knock was conceived even earlier, but didn’t fit the grander vision for follow-up Shoot This, so the half-finished song remained so. Musically, it would slot nicely onto the band’s debut, with its guitars turned to 11, a nice stutter-stop melody in the verses, and a chorus ripe for Homebake singalongs and Hottest 100 Volume 9. The band reformed and toured in 2019 and this song was floating around then, receiving a warm reception and sounding very much at home between American Shoes and Death Defy. If you think the pandemic has rendered the passing of time in an odd way, put Knock Knock on and watch two decades collapse.

4/5/2022,"As dusk has fallen each night for the last seven days, Dan Harley and Arabella Eyre have turned to each other and said: “They’ll be coming out about now.” A week ago, the pair executed a risky plan to relocate five tiny Leadbeater’s possums – each about as heavy as an apple and the size of a fist – from their last remaining bolthole in Victoria to a new home in a forest swamp, three hours’ drive away. “With only 33 left we can’t really afford to get this wrong,” says Dr Harley, a senior ecologist at Zoos Victoria. “There’s a very high risk and you need a lot to go right for them to succeed.” This tiny and critically endangered marsupial is Victoria’s faunal emblem, thought lost forever until their rediscovery in 1961. Land clearing and logging since European invasion has decimated the possum’s habitat of mountain ash swamps. The 2009 Black Saturday bushfire burned almost half of their remaining habitat. Two genetically distinct Leadbeater’s make up the species and are categorised either as a highland or lowland variety. Harley says there are likely just a few thousand of the highland possums left – a frighteningly low number. But the existence of the lowland possum – thought extinct until rediscovered in 1986 – is even more precarious. It has been clinging on in a strip of forest just 4km long and about 100 metres wide at Yellingbo Nature Conservation Reserve – about 50 kilometres east of Melbourne’s CBD. Harley has been monitoring that group for 25 years. Numbers are now so low that there is no need to estimate them. Each one is documented. There are just 33 left, including the five that were translocated a week ago. Modelling suggests that with such a small number left in the wild – and with no success breeding them in captivity – the lowland Leadbeater’s will be extinct within a couple of decades. One single bushfire could be the end of them. Under global heating, that risk is rising. For the lowland group, a translocation has become more and more urgent. “But the alternative is we just monitor them until extinction,” says Harley. “We’re at the point where the risk of doing nothing is greater than the risk of getting it wrong.” Last Tuesday at dawn, after the possums nestled down for their daytime sleep at Yellingbo, the 5cm entry holes were blocked off with a rag. The possums inside had already had tiny radio transmitters attached a few weeks before. The boxes, containing two family groups with five individuals, were taken down, driven three hours to a forest near Mansfield in the state’s north-east, and secured a few metres up on mountain swamp gums. While it was still light and the possums were still sleeping, Harley’s colleague Arabella Eyre pulled out the rag and sneaked down the ladder. “It feels like a crazy rush and there’s some adrenaline pumping. I leave as quietly as I can,” says Eyre, a field officer with Zoos Victoria who has been working with the Leadbeater’s possum for five years. To help them get started, Eyre and Harley have been putting out food for the new arrivals (a mix of nectar, protein powder and egg). That will be slowly scaled back. Each day – “like a benevolent big brother” – Eyre has been spending hours reviewing camera footage of the possums at their den boxes and feeding stations and checking transmitter data. She’s been having dreams about them and wonders if the possums are aware they’re being watched, or if they ever think how the food arrives. “I do often wonder that. But I don’t think they ever hear me.” Harley describes the possums as “like a creature from Tolkien’s Middle-earth” that emerge in twilight like “little sprites”. They’re super fast and super quiet. They’ll appear, and then they’re gone and you don’t hear a thing.” Eyre says the new site could theoretically support up to 100 new possums, but given their shockingly low numbers there are only so many the team can relocate. “It comes down to the possums to breed up their numbers,” she says. As part of the world of the possum’s recovery team – which includes the Victorian government’s Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning and Parks Victoria – the whole eastern side of the state has been surveyed looking for places for translocations. In late 2020, 11 were taken to a large patch of forest at Wallaby Creek. But in just three months, the team started to find radio collars without a possum attached. Cats had likely taken seven and on New Year’s Day 2021 the decision was made to launch an emergency evacuation to catch and return the remaining four possums to the relative safety of Yellingbo. The possum’s predators at that failed translocation site were dominated by feral cats, but at the new site it is mostly invasive foxes. Harley thinks wild dogs in the area could be keeping the foxes busy, reducing the risk for the possums. A second translocation took place last November to test the new site. The eight pioneering settlers are still there, and there are babies. Harley says the tactics to save the possum were originally thought of as a sequence, with habitat restoration and breeding in captivity coming first – each one taking five years or more. Translocation was to be the last step. “But we need to do this all concurrently. We spent millions restoring habitat but we didn’t do it fast enough. We need to be aggressive and proactive now,” he says. “It’s the lack of these swamp forests that we keep banging up against. They’re pasture now and people forget they used to be forests. “We’re searching for solutions in this drastically altered landscape.”",News/Environment,‘We can’t afford to get this wrong’: relocating Leadbeater’s possums is risky – but it’s their only chance,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/05/we-cant-afford-to-get-this-wrong-relocating-leadbeaters-possums-is-risky-but-its-their-only-chance
4/5/2022,"Socceroos coach Graham Arnold is not on social media. It is something he is quite proud of, saying back in January: “I don’t even know how to turn it on”. But if the 58-year-old was on Facebook, it is fair to say his relationship with Football Australia would be set to “it’s complicated”. Last Thursday the federation sought to wrest back control of a rapidly spiralling narrative surrounding its coach’s future when it confirmed, despite speculation to the contrary, that Arnold would see out his contract to the end of the 2022 World Cup cycle. The next – and potentially final – step of that cycle will come in June when Australia’s men face the United Arab Emirates in a do-or-die one-off playoff in Qatar. The winner of that game will then play South American nation Peru for the right to join France, Tunisia and Denmark in Group D in the finals. FA’s release, however, was peculiar. Because while it spoke of the importance of providing Arnold and his staff with a “stable environment” and a level of “certainty” in the lead in to the next fixtures, the preceding week of speculation had been disruptive in the extreme and, seemingly, also born from inside its own walls. Hours after the Socceroos sank to a meek 2-0 loss to Japan that extinguished hopes of automatic qualification, The Age and Sydney Morning Herald reported insiders were telling them that Arnold appeared set for the axe following the Saudi Arabia game, citing deteriorating results and a breach of Covid isolation rules when he went for a beach walk as the final straw. This report, in turn, provided cover for a sea of voices to begin open pontifications surrounding a replacement. Arnold’s closest allies were open in their belief his tenure may end. Even if the federation was still assessing its options following the Japan fixture – as it absolutely should have been doing given it had just missed out on automatic qualification – the vacuum of information was quickly filled by conspiracy, innuendo and anointed successors. Nothing had changed between the initial reports and the stay of execution. If anything, circumstances worsened as the Socceroos sank to another defeat against Saudi Arabia to make it just one win from their last seven qualifiers. Thus, the timing could be interpreted as suggesting the federation was simply unable to find an alternative to Arnold in time for the hard deadline imposed on it by the World Cup draw and resigned itself to merely keeping him on rather than enthusiastically backing him. FA declined to comment when asked when the decision to retain Arnold was ultimately made, referring back to its Thursday media release. The saga following the initial report that Arnold was facing the axe has been a distraction entering critical playoffs and at a time during which Australian football, regardless of results, should be having important conversations surrounding the future of its national teams. Instead, with conjecture about Arnold’s fate dramatically played out in public, the stage has been set for the months ahead to be dominated not by an examination of how this moment came to pass and what lessons can be learned, but of Arnold as a polarising individual and a governing body’s decision to leave him at the helm. Australian football should be embracing the difficult introspection it needs to have right now, not distracting itself with the legacy of a single coach. In a best-case scenario, Arnold and his side are able to shut out the noise, shut up the naysayers and defy the odds by downing the UAE and Peru and advancing to the World Cup. Forget any talk about missing out on the men’s World Cup being a necessary wake-up call for Australian football. All should be rooting for the Socceroos to qualify. The boost that a place on sport’s biggest stage provides in enthusiasm, awareness and treasure is too large to sacrifice. Yet given the same foibles which proved so costly for Australia’s men in the games that actually mattered were all present in the record-setting 11-game winning streak, hopes of a rabbit being pulled out of a hat appear low. For all the talk of a lack of cattle, this group of Socceroos had the talent to beat the likes of China, Oman, and Saudi Arabia at home but did not – as the coach, that is on Arnold. And despite its reported reservations, FA will now have to dance with the one it invited; the figure whose interpretation and approach came to dominate domestic football and, as a result, is now cemented in the national team. If it does not like it, perhaps it should be contemplating why it asked him in the first place.",Sport/Football,Graham Arnold Socceroos speculation is a mess partly of Football Australia’s making | Joey Lynch,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/05/graham-arnold-socceroos-speculation-is-a-mess-partly-of-football-australias-making
4/5/2022,"Enormous opportunities to cut emissions deeply are there, the time to act is now, and it can be done at affordable cost. That would be the shortest possible summary of the thousands of pages of careful assessment in the world’s definitive stocktake of how to limit future climate change. The assessment report released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change implies that while limiting global heating to 1.5C is practically out of reach, staying below 2C is possible in practice. And it is no longer just a theoretical possibility as it used to be not too long ago. The IPCC finds that the world’s emissions could be cut in half by 2030 at affordable costs if action is taken right across the board. Of this, 50% could be achieved at relatively low costs of less than US$20 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent reduced, or even with net economic gains. And that is before taking into account the massive benefits from reducing future climate change, and benefits such as cleaner air and better energy supply security. The dramatic reductions in the costs of clean energy technologies over recent years are a gamechanger; for example, the cost of solar energy has reduced sixfold over just a decade. Positive experiences in the implementation of policies to cut emissions are another reason for optimism. So while the urgency to take action has risen, the opportunities to really make a difference are also much greater. The energy and land sectors are the largest opportunities globally. In energy, the story is about solar and wind power displacing fossil fuels, alongside many other ways of cutting emissions. On the land, it is about reforestation and avoided deforestation, better land management, and a shift to low-emissions agriculture. Industry, transport and buildings are also crucial parts of the puzzle. The IPCC also shows that shifts in consumption habits, including changing diets, are also important. Australia is in pole position on all of these. Ours is a high-emissions economy, which means that it is relatively easy to make big cuts. Add to that Australia’s advantage of a practically unlimited low-cost supply of renewable energy and huge opportunities for better carbon management on the land. But the transition will, of course, also bring its challenges, including for Australia. Fossil fuel use declines dramatically in scenarios of strong global climate action. Coal in particular will be on the way out, with the IPCC projecting reductions of 65% to 95% in global coal use by 2050 in 2C scenarios. The numbers for reductions in gas vary greatly between scenarios, and depend heavily on how far below 2C the world may bet. How to get there in practice? For implementation of climate policy, this IPCC report assesses practical experience, not theory or modelling. The picture that emerges is a very positive one: the world over, climate laws and policies are on the ascendancy, and most measures that governments have taken are effective. Experience has helped refine policies so they also meet other goals. For example, carbon taxes and emissions trading schemes are routinely designed so that low-income groups are protected from adverse financial impacts, by channelling some of the revenue to them. The IPCC finds that packages of policies are the best way to achieve emissions outcomes. Economic instruments like pricing policies then link up with more specific regulatory policies, and are complemented by support for research and development, regional transition and so forth. While the IPCC does not provide country-specific assessments, the implication for Australia is clear: we need to overcome the current situation where there is merely a patchwork of mostly half-hearted policies, and absence of any policy for many aspects of the economy. What we need is a comprehensive set of policies that guides and incentivises the shift to a net zero economy right across the board. This is what will make the needed investment flow. And climate policy should not be the domain of governments and business alone. The IPCC report finds that to achieve the shift that is needed, climate action must involve civil society. Whether it is unions, NGOs, grassroots organisations, the research sector or business associations, all need to be on board and pull in the same general direction. At this point in the electoral cycle, a question often asked is: what are the implications of the election outcome for climate policy? In the picture that arises from the IPCC report, this should not be a question that needs asking. In a world where addressing climate change is done properly, climate policy is not a question of politics. Rather, it would be a shared fundamental objective – just like national security, decent infrastructure or a well-functioning health and education system. Perhaps by the time of the seventh IPCC assessment report, due in perhaps seven years, we may be closer to it. Frank Jotzo is a professor at the Australian National University. He is a lead author of the sixth assessment report of Working Group III of the IPCC, and co-author of its summary for policymakers.",Opinion/Opinion,We urgently need to cut emissions – the good news is we can do it quickly and relatively cheaply,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/apr/05/we-urgently-need-to-cut-emissions-the-good-news-is-we-can-do-it-quickly-and-relatively-cheaply
4/5/2022,"Liberal senator Eric Abetz justified billing taxpayers $2,000 to travel to a lavish farewell gala dinner for Tony Abbott by saying the former prime minister implemented “pro-Tasmania” policies, making his attendance relevant to his home state. The explanation, which was cleared by the expenses watchdog, was used as the basis for charging taxpayers $2,196 to fly to Sydney and back to Hobart, using government cars to get to the party. Abbott’s farewell was held in the grand ballroom of the Miramare Gardens in the Sydney suburb of Terrey Hills on 7 November 2019, with a guest list of 1,000 attenders and Alan Jones as its master of ceremonies. Documents released under freedom of information laws show the watchdog, the Independent Parliamentary Expenses Authority (Ipea), began probing seven Liberal MPs who claimed travel expenses to Sydney on dates coinciding with the party, following a story in the New Daily. Other MPs, including Peter Dutton, Josh Frydenberg, Ben Morton, Greg Hunt and Llew O’Brien said they had been in Sydney principally for other parliamentary business, and did not bill taxpayers for Comcar travel to and from the party itself. None of the five MPs told Ipea they thought the party was parliamentary business. “None of this group accessed work resources to travel within Sydney to the tribute dinner, or advised that they considered the tribute dinner a parliamentary business purpose of their travel to Sydney,” Ipea said in its internal report. Another MP, Kevin Andrews claimed the cost of government Comcars to the party, but said he considered it to be parliamentary business. Andrews, though, told Ipea he also had a range of other parliamentary business in Sydney, separate to the party. In his submission to the watchdog, Abetz told Ipea that “the dominant, indeed only, purpose of my attendance at Terrey Hills was in furtherance of my electoral and parliamentary duties”. He raised no other parliamentary business that he had in Sydney to justify the trip. He said he was at the party to “represent Tasmania (at the head table) … to honour the service of former prime minister Tony Abbott, whose specific pro-Tasmania policies helped to transform the Tasmanian economy from recession to Australia’s stand out state economy and thus transform the personal fortunes of my fellow Tasmanians”. Abetz said “numerous stakeholders” had approached him prior to the party, asking about his attendance, and attempting to organise quick meetings while there. “Many such contacts were had before, during, and after the function.” He said that meant his travel was “clearly, fully, and unambiguously covered by” the rules around MP travel, which allow politicians to bill taxpayers if they are meeting with stakeholders and hearing representations from constituents. Ipea accepted all seven MPs’ explanation and cleared them of any wrongdoing. “Senator Abetz has met the ‘but for’ test in that he does not indicate attendance at the event was incidental to some other parliamentary business, rather he asserts that attendance at the event was the parliamentary business,” the watchdog said in its report. “Given the wide definition of parliamentary business the definition is satisfied.” The Guardian approached Abetz’s office for further comment. His office did not respond to questions, but pointed to a section of the report, which said: “After analysis of the records held by and available to IPEA, and the responses to the questions IPEA put to the parliamentarians, IPEA is of the view that the travel and travel related resources used by [redacted] Senator Abetz and [redacted] met the dominant purpose test set out in section 26 of the PBR Act.”",News/Australia news,"Eric Abetz’s $2,000 expense to attend Tony Abbott farewell dinner justified by former PM’s ‘pro-Tasmania policies’",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/eric-abetzs-2000-expense-to-attend-tony-abbott-farewell-dinner-justified-by-former-pms-pro-tasmania-policies
4/5/2022,"Legislation to be introduced to Victoria’s parliament on Tuesday will allow adopted people to have both their birth and adoptive parents included on their birth certificates for the first time. Under the current law, people who have been adopted in Victoria are issued a new birth certificate with their adoptive name and the name of their adoptive parents. Their original birth certificate is stamped with “cancelled” or “adopted”. The only way for an adopted person to use the birth certificate containing the information of their birth parents is to pursue a discharge of adoption through the county court of Victoria. Last year’s parliamentary inquiry into historical forced adoption, which found 40,000 adoptions were arranged in Victoria from 1958 to 1984, recommended the government introduce integrated birth certificates for those who want them “without delay”. Integrated birth certificates have been recommended by several state and federal inquiries over the past decade and have already been introduced in South Australia, Western Australia and New South Wales. Melbourne woman Cheyne Bull, who was adopted at birth in 1980, said an integrated birth certificate would allow her to be more confident and truthful about who she is. “A birth certificate with just your adoptive family, to me, completely erases who you are,” Bull said. “This will make it OK to have natural parents and adoptive parents, to have two families. It says who you are isn’t shameful, it isn’t a secret, it isn’t something to be legally erased.” The 41-year-old said she always knew she was adopted but it wasn’t talked about. “There’s a lot that goes on in your head because you know you’re adopted but you can’t ask about it and you don’t have any information,” she said. “As a child, I had this image, it’s quite antiquated, of my parents walking through a nursery with all these cots lined up and choosing me. “Then when I was a teenager, I worked in the deli at the local supermarket and I always used to think, ‘that person could be my mother’, whenever I saw someone who looked like me go past.” At 30, Bull applied for her adoption papers through the Department of Health and saw her original birth certificate for the first time. “It had my name that I was given at birth, Zoe, and it had my natural mother’s name on it,” she said. She tracked her mother down on Facebook and they have since kept in touch. “Finding out who you are and where you come from, it doesn’t magically change or fix anything,” Bull said. “I think there’s some wounds with adoption that are always there, but going through that, it made me feel more real – more part of this world.” Bull plans on having some friends over to celebrate when her new birth certificate is finalised. The attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, said the legislation would enable adopted people aged 18 and older who wished to update their records to access a certificate that “better represents their own story”. They would be able to include their birth parents, adoptive parents and the date of their adoption on their certificate. The Victorian registry of birth, deaths and marriages will begin work to develop integrated certificates, which are expected to be available by late 2023. “We know we can’t change the past but we can try repair the damage caused,” Symes said. “This is something that victims of forced adoption have asked for – we’re putting their voices and wishes at the centre of this process.”",News/Australia news,Adopted people can have biological parents on birth certificates under Victorian bill,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/adopted-people-can-have-biological-parents-on-birth-certificates-under-victorian-bill
4/5/2022,"Hundreds of thousands of fish have died after recent flooding in northern New South Wales caused “severe deoxygenation” of rivers, with researchers alarmed at discovering carcasses of species that traditionally tolerate lower oxygen levels. Scientists are still researching the full of extent of the destruction to marine life along the Richmond river, where multiple fish kill events occurred following flooding in late February and early March. The flooding led to a total lack of oxygen in a 60km stretch of the waterway, between Coraki and Ballina on the northern NSW coast. While data on the effects of the latest flood events at the end of March is not yet clear, Southern Cross University researchers who had been undertaking long-term monitoring of the Richmond river in a project with the NSW Department of Planning and Environment believe the final fish death toll will be in the hundreds of thousands. Fish kills from deoxygenation occur when floodwaters overtop the riverbanks and spill out onto lower lying parts of the floodplain, covering grass and vegetation, which depletes all oxygen in the river as it decays and rots in the overlying water. Prof Damien Maher, who is leading the university’s research project, which includes installing logger machines to measure oxygen levels, said no fish could survive in the 60km stretch of the Richmond river without oxygen. He said researchers had already discovered the remains of species normally tolerant of low oxygen levels, such as carp. Most of the dead fish washed out to sea. “We also saw a bunch of dead eels, and they normally survive these events,” Maher said. Cassie Price, from the non-profit group OzFish, which gathers data on waterways to support recreational fishers, was also surprised when she heard reports of mulloway fish among those killed. “The unusual thing about this fish kill is that some of the fish are really big species that can go offshore normally,” she said. “Some of these fish have been up to two metres long. “We suspect they became trapped between bodies of water, when they’ve come in to feed off smaller fish, and they’ve not been able to get back out after waters receded. “The oxygen was dead zero, there were no pockets of good water for them to go.” Prof Scott Johnston, a landscape hydrogeochemist from Southern Cross University, said deoxygenation was not uncommon in lower parts of the Richmond river after large floods, and that the fish kills were just the “tip of the ecological iceberg”. He said human modification of the lower floodplain had unintentionally made fish kill events more frequent and severe, and warned of a “second wave” of impact as floodplains began to drain. “Large areas of the floodplain have acid sulphate soils in them at fairly shallow depth. So once the flood recedes and the surface water drains away, it starts pulling the shallow ground water from the wetlands into the river, which has high levels of sulphuric acid and metals,” Johnston said. Metal contaminants could lead to secondary fish kills, he said. Maher said it would take months for fish to begin repopulating and “years and years until the rivers resemble anything like how it was prior to the floods”. Conversely, Maher said there could yet be a positive impact on the ecosystem as the severity of upheaval could lead to a “reset”. “Over time what you have is an accumulation of sediments through erosion on the riverbed. Back in pre-European times, the whole catchment was forested, so that erosion was quite minimal,” he said. “With everything washed into the ocean, we’ve essentially kind of gone back to that state, in that we don’t have a whole heap of that fine silt sediment in the system now.” That could lead to river beds being rockier and having clearer water once they had naturally restored, Maher said. “If there are ways to stop the excess sediment in the upper catchment that’s been moved around through these landslides and prevent that from getting back into the river, we may actually be looking at a river system that’s partly reverted back towards its natural state.”",News/Australia news,Hundreds of thousands of fish dead after NSW floods,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/hundreds-of-thousands-of-fish-dead-after-nsw-floods
4/5/2022,"Only a quarter of Guardian Essential respondents think the Morrison government’s cash splash budget is good for them personally, and just over half (56%) think the budget’s primary purpose is to help the Coalition win the coming election. The new poll findings come as shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, sharpens Labor’s criticism of last week’s budget as “self-obsessed, short-term, and out-of-touch with reality”, warning that sticking to the status quo will entrench a “wasted decade” of lost economic opportunities. The latest poll of 1,086 respondents suggests Australians are voters are worried about rising consumer prices (61% of respondents rate that as their top issue) but only 33% say the specific budget measures, which include cash payments for low and middle income earners and a cut to fuel excise, would make a significant difference. While historically the Coalition has a political edge over Labor on questions of economic management, Labor currently has an 11-point lead on the most salient indicator. Asked which political party they trusted more to address rising cost of living pressure, 38% of respondents nominated Labor, 27% said the Coalition, and 35% said the party made no difference. A super majority of respondents (88%) said they believed governments still exerted a lot or a little influence on the direction of household expenses (only 12% said governments were powerless). While the Morrison government was hopeful the budget would deliver a bounce to carry the government into an election contest, now just days away, the positive political impact of the Coalition’s pre-election economic statement appeared to be negligible. Only 25% of respondents said the budget had made them more likely to vote for the Coalition, and a further 19% said less likely. Half the Guardian Essential sample said the budget measures would have no impact on their vote. Voting intention figures, calculated by Guardian Essential, now express the head-to-head metric of the major party contest as two-party preferred “plus”, rather than the standard two-party preferred measure. This change in methodology, adopted after the 2019 election, highlights the proportion of undecided voters in any survey, providing accuracy on the limits of any prediction. In the latest results, the Coalition’s primary vote is 37%, Labor is on 36%, the Greens are on 10%, independents and others are on 5%, the United Australia party is on 3% and Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party is on 4%. In the poll a fortnight ago, Labor’s primary vote was 37% (up from 35% in the previous survey) and the Coalition’s was 37% (up from 36%), with 7% of respondents undecided.

A fortnight ago Labor was on 48% (down from 49% in the previous survey) and the Coalition, 44% (steady), with 7% of respondents undecided. The major parties are now in full campaign mode, with the leaders and frontbenchers barnstorming marginal seats around the country. With the real contest imminent, Scott Morrison is attempting to shrug off renewed criticism about the controversial Cook preselection in 2007. Morrison and Anthony Albanese will make pitches to the politically influential farm lobby, the National Farmers Federation, on Tuesday. Speaking at his traditional budget-in-reply speech later in Canberra, Chalmers will target the political nature of the Coalition’s budget, accusing treasurer Josh Frydenberg of a budget that was “conceived as a prop for the election”. He will also adopt an attack line made famous by Kevin Rudd before the 2007 election when he sought to neutralise economic management as a political issue, saying the Howard government’s “reckless spending” needed to stop. “To paraphrase another Queenslander – I say this to Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg: this reckless rorting and wasteful spending must stop,” Chalmers will say, according to draft excerpts of his speech. “If it’s not the time to flick a switch to austerity, it is the time to flick a switch to quality.” Chalmers labelled the Coalition the “most wasteful government since federation”, pointing to $5.5bn for submarines “that will never be built”, and grant money going to sports rorts, car parks and “dodgy” land deals. “[This is] the worst set of books ever presented before an election – a budget riddled with rorts and choc-full of wasteful spending, a treasurer personally culpable for tens of billions of emergency support for businesses which didn’t need it,” Chalmers says. He said there had been a $103.6bn improvement to the budget bottom line as a result of commodity price rises, “but still $1.169tn worth of generational debt without a generational dividend.” “The wrong response to this uncertainty, this context, this backdrop – is to continue on the current course and cling to the status quo,” he says. “The most damaging thing Australia could do right now, the biggest economic and social harm we could inflict, would be to accept flatlining wages, soaring prices, tepid investment and weak growth – as our best-case scenario, our new normal. “That’s not stability, that’s stagnation.” Chalmers has also talked up the Labor party’s pledge to increase funding to the aged care sector, saying the opposition’s commitment to aged care and childcare made up only one-fifth of the new spending decisions unveiled in the Coalition’s latest budget. “When it comes to value for money it’s hard to think of a better investment than in aged care.” “It has been disappointing but not surprising to see the lengths this government will go to, to deny people decent care, decent food and decent wages.”",News/Australia news,Poll: Coalition cash splash leaves voters cold as just a quarter say budget will be good for them,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/poll-coalition-cash-splash-leaves-voters-cold-as-just-a-quarter-say-budget-will-be-good-for-them
4/5/2022,"Conservationists have accused Adani of breaching its legal obligation to protect the black-throated finch displaced by the clearing or impact of 16,000 hectares of its habitat near the Carmichael coalmine, after obtaining draft documents about the species’ management. BirdLife Australia’s Stephanie Todd said Adani’s proposed new management plan for the endangered finch – obtained under Queensland’s Right to Information laws – shows Adani had “sidelined” independent scientists with whom the mining company is required to consult. Todd also accused the state’s environment department of not enforcing Adani’s obligation to work with the black-throated finch recovery team, which she said rendered its stated commitment to doing so as “lip service”. She said the existing management plan was already “grossly inadequate” – an assertion based on an independent scientific panel the Queensland government commissioned, mostly ignored, and then tried to keep secret. But the James Cook University researcher said the fact that a new plan containing several “red flags” was drafted without the input of the recovery team demonstrated a failure of post-approval environmental regulation. “It’s just become a box-checking exercise – and they are not even checking all the boxes,” Todd said. Adani, now operating as Bravus, responded to questions from Guardian Australia with a statement declaring it “fully compliant with its commitments” to protect local black-throated finch populations. “These unfounded allegations are the latest in a misinformation campaign that opponents of the mine have been running for many years,” a spokesperson said. Queensland’s Department of Environment and Science responded with a statement also denying Adani had breached its obligations towards the finch and strongly rejecting suggestions it had enabled the company to do so. Essentially, the dispute comes down to what is meant by the requirement to consult. Environmental approvals commit Adani to a management plan for the black-throated finch on its mine site and a 33,000 hectare conservation area meant to offset its destruction of the finch’s habitat. “All revisions of the survey and monitoring program must be carried out in consultation with the BTF recovery team,” Adani’s environmental authority reads. But Adani has drafted a new management plan which, if approved, would change its survey and monitoring methodology, and flagged those changes with the environment department mid-last year. Adani said it was obliged to consult with the department on updates to the management plan. “This is precisely what Bravus is doing as the first step, and other stakeholders will be consulted in due course as required,” Adani said. The department said in a statement that it would ensure “Bravus can demonstrate that it has consulted” with the recovery team before it approved and revisions to survey or monitoring programs. But the recovery team’s chair, Dr April Reside, said the first she was made aware of the proposed new methods was through BirdLife’s Right to Information request – and that she was still waiting for consultation. Todd, who also works with the recovery team, said that if Adani was serious about consultation it would have been discussing its proposed changes with Reside and her colleagues well before taking them to the department last July. If the mining company had done so, the scientists would have raised serious concerns. They are concerned that proposed changes to monitoring methodology would be unable to pick up “catastrophic population declines”. Todd said that a decline of up to 80% could occur on the mine site before on Adani’s surveyors noticed the difference. “That would probably see it uplisted to critically endangered and, yeah, they don’t have a good chance of surviving from there,” Todd said. Adani’s environmental monitors would also spend less time observing the water holes from which finches drink. Rather than the six hours specifically required by a land court ruling in 2015, monitoring would take place over three. Reside said if the mining company had data which supported scaling back monitoring, she would “love to see it”. “That would be so helpful to our monitoring programs,” she said. “If that’s true, great, let us know, we’re dying to see it.” This, according to the researchers, is another front on which Adani is not meeting the obligations of its environmental approval. These commit the company to “sharing the findings” of its research with the recovery team.

Reside, who is authoring the updated plan, says she has not received any data from Adani to help inform that plan. Adani insists upon legally binding data-sharing agreements before it will share this data, and the recovery team says it does not have the resources to do so. Reside said this stalemate and Adani’s sidelining of her recovery team comes at a time at which mounting evidence showed regulation to protect threatened species was failing. “There’s lots of evidence that the failure to regulate impacts is a really important part of this,” she said. “The black-throated finch is just one of many examples.”",News/Australia news,Conservationists accuse Adani of ‘sidelining’ experts on endangered black-throated finch ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/conservationists-accuse-adani-of-sidelining-experts-on-endangered-black-throated-finch
4/5/2022,"Victorian police would be required to notify the state’s Department of Health of toxic batches of drugs under an amendment to the state’s public health laws proposed by the Greens. The Greens’ changes to the public health and wellbeing amendment bill, which is set to be debated in the upper house this week, would see certain drugs, poisons and controlled substances declared as notifiable based on their potential serious risk to public health. This would mean police officers would be required to notify the department within a specified timeframe if they encounter the substances during the performance of their duties. The definition of “serious risk to public health” means that alcohol or illegal drugs such as heroin would not be listed as notifiable in normal circumstances despite their impact on public health. Instead, it is likely synthetic drugs such as NBOMe would be listed, based on their involvement in mass overdose events and fatalities in Victoria in recent years. It comes after five Victorian men, aged between 17 and 32, died in separate incidents in 2016 and 2017 after ingesting tablets that contained a dangerous combination of two psychoactive substances. Several others were also hospitalised. The tablets were being marketed around Melbourne, including the nightclub scene, as MDMA but actually comprised 25C-NBOMe and 4-Fluoroamphetamine. The Victorian coroner investigated the deaths and last year recommended the state government urgently implement a service to check the content and purity of illicit drugs, as well as an early warning network to alert the public to dangerous drugs in the community. The department has been issuing specific drug alerts since 2020, but the Greens spokesperson for health, Tim Read, said the information did not come from Victoria police but from public hospitals and the Victorian Poisons Centre. “This means whether or not a specific drug alert is issued is dependent on which agency discovers the drug, rather than the inherent public health risk of the drug. This is unacceptable,” Read said. “The government must ensure there is a consistent approach to public health surveillance rather than an agency-by-agency policy.” Read said the proposed amendments were a “very small piece of harm minimisation” that could have a huge impact on public health.

So ironically, the police may find it more effective to implement this policy.” A Victoria police spokesperson said in a statement that an early warning system was a matter for the health department. “Victoria police will continue to work closely with a range of stakeholders from the state government, health and education to progress a collaborative approach to reducing the harm caused from drugs,” he said. “Victoria police’s stance is simple: there is no such thing as a safe tablet or illicit drug. There is no way of knowing what’s in a drug and every time someone consumes an illicit substance, they are endangering their health and ultimately, risking their life. “Police will continue to play our part in minimising harm by detecting, disrupting and arresting those people who cause significant harm in our community by trafficking drugs.”",News/Australia news,Push to force Victorian police to alert health officials to toxic batches of drugs,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/05/push-to-force-victorian-police-to-alert-health-officials-to-toxic-batches-of-drugs
4/5/2022,"Since forming in 1991, Australian children’s group the Wiggles have pretty much seen it all. They’ve created a vast discography spanning 59 studio albums alone – and last year, they were the second-highest streamed Australian act on Spotify across all genres. In their heyday, the original group performed to more than 1 million people a year. But in recent years, they’ve been noticing something new: a generational crossover. Their fans have grown up, many have formed their own bands – and they’re still Wiggles fans. This became obvious in 2018, when Brisbane hard rock duo DZ Deathrays invited guitarist Murray Cook to guest in their video Like People. In the clip, a demonically possessed Cook emerges from a bathroom stall and appears to be taken over by his former character, Red Wiggle. Later that year, Cook – who retired from live performances with the Wiggles in 2012, along with original Purple Wiggle Jeff Fatt – appeared with DZ Deathrays at the Splendour in the Grass festival. The audience went totally Apples and Bananas. This set the stage for last year’s all-conquering cover of Tame Impala’s Elephant, for which Cook returned – and which went on to win the country’s biggest music poll, the Triple J Hottest 100. “I just started noticing I was getting stopped in the street a lot by 20-somethings saying ‘the Wiggles were my childhood, you guys are legends!’”, Cook tells Guardian Australia. And now there is a full covers album, ReWiggled, with bands including DZ Deathrays, Spacey Jane, San Cisco and the Polish Club playing Wiggles songs, and a second disc of the recently expanded kids’ group joining the originals to honour their favourite songs. This is actually the second Wiggles tribute album. An earlier version, featuring the Living End, Washington, Sarah Blasko and Adalita, was released in 2011 and reissued late in 2021, capitalising on Elephant’s viral success. But the new edition debuted at No. 1 on the Australian charts last month. Perhaps surprisingly, for a group with multiple gold and platinum certifications worldwide, it’s their first album to hit the top spot in their home country. Cook, a pre-pandemic regular on the live scene, is tickled by the validation from younger musicians. “I find it particularly satisfying that so many people I meet tell me that the Wiggles were their entrée to music. To me that’s, like, mission accomplished.” A new cover that made Cook laugh was the Chats version of (Can You) Point Your Fingers and Do the Twist. “In our version, there’s a spoken part where Anthony’s going, ‘What’s next Greg, what’s next?’ – and they did those bits as well.” A children’s song isn’t an obvious fit for a ratbag punk band to cover, but the Wiggles returned the favour with their version of the Chats’ Pub Feed. “That was funny, too,” Cook says. “It took me three days to learn the solo for [Queen’s] Bohemian Rhapsody, but I knocked out Pub Feed in about half an hour – which I love, I think that’s fantastic! They’re great songs for different reasons.” The Chats’ Eamon Sandwith is in awe at this. “They were the first band that I loved,” he says earnestly. “When they approached us to be part of the ReWiggled album, I couldn’t believe it. It’s not often I get starstruck, but I totally was. I couldn’t believe that they knew who we were, when I’d been listening to them since I was about two years old.” Back then, Sandwith would get dressed up as Captain Feathersword for Wiggles shows; he texts through a photo as proof. “When I first heard their cover of Pub Feed, it honestly sounded like a Wiggles song,” he says. “Perhaps their style of songwriting has subconsciously influenced me since I was a child, because I was blown away at how Wiggly it sounded.” Custard, who in age terms are closer to peers than descendants of the Wiggles, take on Do the Propeller. Curiously, it could pass for a Custard song. Singer David McCormack is now better known to millions as another icon of Australian kids’ entertainment: he voices Bandit, dad of Bluey, in the global juggernaut series named after her. He became aware of the extent of the Wiggles’ reach when his eldest daughter, Rose, was born. “There’s a whole world of children’s entertainment out there and 90% of it is awful, but 10% is really interesting,” McCormack says. “It’s really hard to rise to the top of that pile, and they’ve done it for decades. “They’ve got great craft and knowledge. They know how to get a lyric or an idea across that is seemingly inane and yet connects universally with kids all over the world, as well as parents. If it was easy to do and everyone could do it, everyone would do it. They’re massively successful because they’re very, very good at what they do.” Cook and Fatt are semi-retired from the band, while remaining active as shareholders. Yellow Wiggle Greg Page left in 2006, then returned and left again in 2012. Blue Wiggle Anthony Field subsequently rebuilt the group with Simon Pryce, Lachie Gillespie and Emma Watkins. The popular Watkins departed last year and was replaced by Tsehay Hawkins, then just 15. Now, both versions of the group are collaborating on a run of shows, with the new lineup doing the day shift and the originals doing the late gigs, joined by many of the artists they inspired. “It’s mind-blowing when you come out on stage and there’s this roar, but they’re all adults, not little kids,” Cook says. Fatt and Page both left the group for health reasons, and Page suffered a heart attack on stage during a bushfire relief reunion in January 2020. Cook, 61, underwent open heart surgery in late 2020. Relentless touring had ground them all down, so this one is happening at a pace the original members can accommodate. And after that? Will Cook put the red skivvy back in its box, until he’s possessed once more? “Yeah, probably for a little while,” he says. “But I think we’ll go on and do more of these, just because they’re so much fun, and while there’s an audience there. I don’t know if people are still going to want to come and sing Wiggles songs when they’re 40.” ReWiggled is out now; the OG Wiggles reunion tour continues until 7 May 2022",Arts/Music,How the Wiggles took over the world – and got the cool kids on side too,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/05/how-the-wiggles-took-over-the-world-and-got-the-cool-kids-on-side-too
4/5/2022,"With the Easter break now under way, passengers at UK airports have been facing severe disruption to their plans, with long delays and hundreds of flights cancelled. Why has this been happening and what can be done? In brief, Covid-19. The relatively sudden lifting of UK pandemic restrictions has resulted in soaring demand for travel, after two years when the coronavirus testing and “traffic light” regime had made holidays either impossible or an expensive risk. This has been accompanied by a huge increase in Covid cases across the UK, to which aviation staff are obviously not immune. Out of the airlines, easyJet seems to be suffering most, with Covid having infected large numbers of crew at its Gatwick base in particular. British Airways has only cancelled a few flights because of sickness. Sickness rates have contributed to problems for some airports – but airports such as Manchester are mainly struggling to recruit staff quickly enough to meet demand for the busiest Easter getaway since 2019. Passengers at Manchester already faced hours of queues for check-in, security and baggage reclaim even before Easter, and the situation looks unlikely to be resolved soon. In common with most airports, airlines and aviation suppliers (such as baggage handlers or security firms), Manchester’s staff were largely furloughed, and hundreds were laid off during the pandemic, when leisure travel was all but stopped for long periods. But Manchester appears to have been less prepared than airports such as Gatwick, which reopened its second terminal smoothly last week. Heathrow, too, says it will need another 1,000 staff for summer. Recruitment is less easy than airports may have hoped: workers are in demand across other sectors, with big incentives for trainee drivers, for example. Airports not only need to recruit the right staff but put them through rigorous vetting procedures for security. This Home Office process has also faced some delays, airports claim. Unions are blunter. Unite’s general secretary, Sharon Graham, said: “We warned the aviation sector repeatedly not to use the cover of Covid to slash jobs and pay … Now the sector is suffering from a chronic inability to attract new staff because workers are not attracted to an industry where pay is poor and conditions are lousy.” While the UK has lifted most Covid restrictions, not all countries have, meaning some additional checks. There are perennial problems that have been thrown into the mix: malfunctioning e-gates causing queues at the border at Heathrow, and British Airways has recently been hit by a recurrence of its IT issues, glitches that caused numerous cancellations. When a flight is cancelled or delayed by more than three hours, passengers are currently entitled to compensation of £220 if the distance involved is 1,500km or less (for example, domestic flights), rising to £520 for some long-haul journeys, unless the cause was “extraordinary circumstances”. This is not clearly defined but could include things such as bad weather and acts of terrorism. Passengers delayed by less than three hours are not entitled to any compensation. It is thought that typically in the past, something such as staff illness would not be described by an airline as an extraordinary circumstance. But it remains to be seen whether airlines will claim that high levels of Covid infections among staff put this in a different league to previous cases. Rory Boland, the travel editor for the consumer organisation Which?, said this was always likely to be a popular holiday time, so there was a responsibility on airlines to ensure they have the capacity to run all of the flights they schedule. He added: “Most passengers will just want to get where they need to be despite this disruption, so airlines must meet their legal obligations and inform passengers of their right to be rerouted with other carriers or claim a refund. “Affected passengers will be entitled to at least £220 compensation in these circumstances to cover out-of-pocket costs, and airlines should provide refreshments and accommodation as required while their customers await their new flight.”",News/Business,What is behind the disruption at UK airports?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/what-is-behind-the-disruption-at-uk-airports
4/5/2022,"Kanye West has dropped out of the Coachella music festival just over one week before it opens, TMZ and Variety reported on Monday. The 44-year-old rapper was set to headline North America’s largest music festival for two weekends in April along with Billie Eilish, Harry Styles and the electronic group Swedish House Mafia. There were no reported reasons for West’s cancellation, but the news comes after several weeks of publicly combative and unpredictable behavior from the rapper. In recent months, West has repeatedly lashed out at his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, and her boyfriend, the Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson, and released a music video in which a claymation version of Davidson is kidnapped and killed. Last month, Instagram suspended West for 24 hours after he used a racial slur to describe the TV host Trevor Noah, who called West’s harassment of Kardashian “terrifying to watch” and representative of “what so many women go through when they choose to leave” in a lengthy Daily Show segment. After the Instagram suspension, West was barred from a performance at last night’s Grammy Awards – hosted by Noah – due to what was described as his “concerning online behavior”. A petition to remove him from the Coachella lineup had since gathered almost 50,000 signatures in recent weeks. In February, West had also claimed he would pull out of the festival if fellow headliner Eilish didn’t apologise to Travis Scott over a perceived slight, related to the singer helping a fan during a concert. West saw it as an attack on Scott’s handling of the Astroworld disaster. In 2016, West also cancelled the final leg of his Saint Pablo tour after several controversial and unpredictable on-stage rants; he was hospitalized for a mental health breakdown shortly thereafter. West’s Coachella cancellation also scraps a potential appearance by rapper Travis Scott, whom West was reportedly planning to bring on stage. It would have been Scott’s first large-capacity performance since the disaster at his Astroworld festival in Houston last November, when a crowd crush killed 10 people. Scott was originally supposed to headline Coachella in 2020, delayed by Covid until 2022, but pulled out of the festival after the tragedy. West previously headlined the Indio, California-based festival in 2011 and has not performed his own set since, though he has made surprise appearances in performances by The Weeknd in 2015 and Kid Cudi in 2019. The Guardian has contacted representatives for both West and Coachella.",Arts/Music,"Kanye West pulls out of Coachella music festival, say reports",https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/04/kanye-west-coachella-pulls-out-reports-show-cancelled
