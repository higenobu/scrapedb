1/20/2022,"Boris Johnson faced a defection and a demand to quit from one of his most senior MPs during a dramatic day in Westminster, with even allies of the prime minister warning the current situation cannot go on. David Davis caused shockwaves when he told Johnson in the Commons: “In the name of God go.” Less than an hour earlier, Christian Wakeford, MP for Bury South, quit the Conservatives and joined Labour in fury at the Downing Street parties scandal.  The prime minister vowed to battle on in No 10 and his supporters insisted he now had the breathing space for a fightback, with many MPs awaiting the outcome of the Sue Gray inquiry. But Johnson faces a growing clamour from Tory backbenchers to buy their support in any confidence vote by ditching a £12bn-a-year tax rise this spring. National insurance contributions are due to increase from April to fund health and social care and any U-turn could risk a showdown with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak. Johnson managed to get through the day without a confidence vote being triggered. Tory MPs estimated that as many as 30 letters may now have been submitted out of the 54 required, with more expected to come in after Gray, a senior civil servant, delivers her finding on alleged rule-breaking in Downing Street next week. The rebellion has so far been led publicly by disillusioned 2019-intake MPs worried about the plunge in support in their seats. But sources said the next wave of letters was likely to come in from “One Nation” Conservatives from the centrist wing of the party if the Gray report is sufficiently damning of Johnson’s conduct. Tory MPs said Johnson was not out of the woods, with two ministers describing the current situation as a “shit show”. One minister said he was reserving judgment until after the Gray findings but the prime minister did not have “carte blanche” to continue in post. The decision of many colleagues about whether to continue backing the prime minister may hinge on whether they think he will seriously harm the party’s chances in the local elections, he added. Numerous Tory MPs described to the Guardian a deluge of angry letters from constituents, ranging from 250 to 2,000 in one case – surpassing the anger at the lockdown-busting trips of the former No 10 aide Dominic Cummings. Johnson held meetings with MPs on Wednesday in an effort to persuade them to hold off from submitting no confidence letters and tried to curry favour with his backbenchers by announcing an end to Covid regulations in England. However, backbenchers said he would need to do more and many remain undecided about whether he should continue in the job. One senior MP who is strongly supporting the prime minister said if he was to survive he would need new senior staff in No 10 to “put him in a straitjacket”. The MP also advised a new “cabinet enforcer”, a reshuffle to remove disloyal cabinet members and a move to address the cost of living crisis by ditching the rise in national insurance contributions. “Is he mortally wounded? That is the question. He is wounded. But if anyone can turn this around, he can,” he said. A cabinet minister tried to claim Wakeford’s move had a “unifying” effect among Tories and could “draw a line under the whole thing” – but another said the prime minister’s position remained “precarious”. Senior Labour sources said they were in touch with other “very unhappy” Tory MPs about the prospect of potentially joining the Conservatives, which would be a further serious blow to the prime minister’s authority. The defection happened just before a chaotic prime minister’s questions, with Wakeford crossing the floor to sit with Labour and blaming Johnson’s own “disgraceful” conduct. After a fierce set of exchanges between Johnson and Keir Starmer, the Labour leader said: “Doesn’t the country deserve so much better than this out-of-touch, out-of-control, out-of-ideas and soon to be out-of-office prime minister?” There was then silence in the Commons as Davis rose to tell Johnson that he had spent weeks defending him from “angry constituents” but that repeated reports about lockdown-breaching parties were too much. The former Brexit secretary and leadership contender said: “I expect my leaders to shoulder the responsibility for the actions they take. Yesterday he did the opposite of that. So I will remind him of a quotation which may be familiar to his ear, Leopold Amery to Neville Chamberlain: ‘You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go.’” Asked by the Guardian afterwards what had motivated him to make an intervention, Davis said Johnson’s interview to Sky News on Tuesday was “not what I expect from a leader”. “Up until now I had been supporting him … but it’s not leadership,” he said. “Yesterday’s interview was an attempt to escape responsibility, not to shoulder it. And that is a test of leadership.” Junior colleagues are understood to have been pressing Davis to make a statement publicly calling for the prime minister to go, saying the situation needed a “big figure” to intervene. Johnson insisted in the Commons that he had no intention of resigning, while his press secretary afterwards told reporters that he would fight to carry on if any confidence ballot is triggered. The prime minister also revealed that Gray’s report is likely to be published early next week amid speculation it could come this week. With the party’s limbo continuing until then, many Tory backbenchers sounded despairing about the ongoing situation. “Where are the leaders? Where are the strategists to navigate our way through this?” said Tory MP and former minister Tobias Ellwood. “Instead we have this blue on blue.” ",News/Politics,Boris Johnson faces growing demands to quit from Tory backbenchers,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/boris-johnson-faces-growing-demands-to-quit-from-tory-backbenchers
1/20/2022,"MPs arrived sore-headed and sleepless into Westminster on Wednesday, many anticipating an imminent vote of no confidence in the prime minister. The opposition were already giddy. “I couldn’t sleep last night,” one Labour MP said. “But my office manager joked: ‘If you don’t go to sleep, Graham Brady won’t come.’” Some rebel Tories had stayed late at the members-only Carlton Club, suspicious of being spied on amid their plotting. An indignant Nadine Dorries, who was there with her special adviser, said it was only for a long-planned work dinner. Other veteran MPs – no friends of Boris Johnson – had stayed up late too, but in their case to call colleagues to urge caution.  “We must hold our nerve,” one longtime critic of the prime minister said. “There is nothing worse than a wounded prime minister limping on. If these greenhorns trigger it too soon then he will be able to argue – quite rightly – that the inquiry [by the civil servant Sue Gray into Downing Street parties] has not been heard and that he deserves to stay on.” Another said of those submitting no-confidence letters: “They’re jumping sub judice. It’s impossible to control this.” For the first time in months, the target of Tory anger on Wednesday morning was not their leader but their newly elected colleagues who convened for the so-called pork pie putsch in Alicia Kearns’s office on Tuesday night. Even those who agreed with their assessment seemed affronted. “These people are clearly getting a lot of aggro in their inboxes and they don’t know how to handle it [but] lots of those constituents would never vote for them,” one MP said. “They’re like captives who haven’t been properly socialised [during the pandemic]; they think they should all be ministers already.” Another former minister said: “My letter hasn’t gone in yet but it might after Sue Gray submits. Until then I don’t have a case to put to other colleagues. The last thing any of us want to do is look like an idiot, like Jacob Rees-Mogg did when he waved that letter about Theresa May.” Some of the anger was aimed at Kearns directly. “It’s all very well for her, she’s got a 20,000 majority,” a fellow 2019-intake MP said. “It’s obviously pissed a lot of people off.” In Keir Starmer’s office, aides were also jumpy about whether their big reveal – the defecting Tory MP Christian Wakeford – would hold his nerve. Wakeford had met Starmer in his office on Monday night as his fellow MPs also met in secret to plot Johnson’s end. The defection news dropped as MPs squeezed through the chamber doors into the House of Commons before Boris Johnson’s painful hour of prime minister’s questions. Wakeford was crossing the floor. “CHRISTIAN?!” MP Anthony Browne messaged in the 2019ers’ WhatsApp group. Before things could deteriorate, Aaron Bell was swift, removing Wakeford from the group. In the aftermath, after Wakeford sat behind the Labour leader in his union jack face mask, whips said he had become agitated after a difficult conversation on Tuesday night, his Bury South seat under threat from boundary changes. “It would have been a straight fight with Dehenna Davison,” one MP said of the fellow 2019er. “Often this is self-interest at the end of the day.” Johnson’s allies, including a full-throated Conor Burns, roared in PMQs to give him support. Other 2019 MPs also yelled enthusiastically, Jacob Young slapping his thighs and jabbing fingers at Starmer. May, the most recent leader to understand the pressure Johnson is now under, sat stony-faced. At one point, Johnson was so animated that Rishi Sunak tugged the prime minister’s jacket to get him to sit back down. But the defection was not the only moment of drama in PMQs. David Davis, standing slowly to savour the moment and sounding at first as if he might defend Johnson instead boomed: “In the name of God, go!” at a blindsided prime minister. But as with Wakeford, it seemed to have a galvanising effect in the opposite direction to the one intended. “Cromwell!” one frontbencher snarled at Davis as he left. No colleagues patted him on the back or nodded in approval after he gave his verdict. Davis told assembled journalists that Johnson’s interview on Tuesday, where he appeared to suggest he did not understand his own rules, had tipped him over the edge. But, he caveated, he himself had not put in a no-confidence letter. A cabinet minister hurrying past said that Wakeford’s departure had been an unlikely boost to Johnson. “It’s brought us together, if anything.” Asked about Davis, they shrugged: so what? Jonathan Gullis, the 2019 MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, claimed colleagues were now being persuaded to withdraw letters, though he could not name any. Passing a similar discussion between Tory MPs in the next corridor, a Labour MP shrugged: “Do you think we give a fuck if he goes today or at the next election? The longer the better.” But two ministers said they were cautious about accepting the spin from whips that Wakeford had saved Johnson. “He’s not out of the woods and he certainly doesn’t have carte blanche from me. It’s a shitshow in there [No 10]. We are heading to losing a lot of good councillors in May.” Another MP said the last 48 hours had convinced Johnson he needed a proper operation to defend him – a shadow whipping operation led by his old friend Burns. “He really did not take this seriously until Conor said, look boss, do you want me to make some calls? But now they are at least out there, making the argument.” At the very least, Johnson is at the mercy of his MPs’ demands, many agitating for a cabinet reshuffle and the cancellation of the national insurance rise. But one senior Tory said the last 12 hours had also given some colleagues pause for thought about the alternatives to Johnson. “Who are we going to put in his place? There is no plan. When we spent 12 months discussing Theresa May’s demise, you don’t do it overnight, there was a strategy and an obvious successor. And it wasn’t because we got a few nasty letters from constituents.” Another said they were also in despair about any possible successor. “Sunak’s interview yesterday was deranged. Liz [Truss] is clearly a risk. Who is it now?”",News/Politics,A day of anger and defection keeps the partygate scandal boiling,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/a-day-of-anger-and-defection-keeps-the-partygate-scandal-boiling
1/20/2022,"Israel’s minister of public security has expressed his firm support for the country’s police force after allegations it used NSO Group’s controversial Pegasus software to spy on Israeli citizens. In an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday, Omer Barlev, the cabinet minister with responsibility for policing, denied claims made this week by Hebrew-language financial daily Calculist that the phones of people who led protests against former premier Benjamin Netanyahu had been hacked into or surveilled by police.  “It’s not true, what was mentioned in the newspaper. But [the technology] isn’t the issue. The issue is whether the police got legal permission from a judge to use it,” he said. “The right to protest is a basic right, it’s not a crime. It’s not that the police wanted to listen to the phones of people who were involved in riots and they went to the judge, and the judge didn’t give permission. The police didn’t even ask even once to do that.” Barlev qualified, however, that the ministry’s next steps on the matter would be determined by the preliminary assessment of attorney general Avichai Mandelblit. “I am waiting to hear what Mandelblit will say. After that, if I am not 98% convinced – because there’s no such thing as 100% convinced – I will think about how to deal with it,” he said. A consortium of 17 media outlets, including the Guardian, revealed last year that Pegasus, an Israeli-made surveillance product that can turn a mobile phone into a pocket spying device, had been sold to repressive governments worldwide and used to spy on human rights activists, journalists and lawyers, as well as government officials and heads of state. Israel says it has since tightened rules on the export of cyberweapons, and NSO was blacklisted by the US in November. The Israeli state and private firms have developed sophisticated surveillance systems to monitor the activities of people in the occupied Palestinian territories, where Israel implements military law. Senior NSO officials had previously said, however, that its software was not authorised for use against Israeli and US telephone numbers. The article in Calculist on Tuesday alleged that the police used Pegasus against citizens at the forefront of protests against Netanyahu last year, when he was still prime minister, as well as mayors and former government employees. According to the report, the surveillance was carried out without court supervision and without monitoring how the data was used. The claims were denied by the police service. In a statement released by NSO after the report, the company reiterated its longstanding claim that it had no input into how its clients used its spyware. A separate report in the daily Haaretz, based on an invoice seen by the paper, suggested the Israeli police was invoiced by NSO group for 2.7m shekels (£635,000) in 2013, apparently for a basic version of the programme. NSO would neither confirm nor deny it sold technologies to Israeli police. The allegations prompted outrage across Israel’s political spectrum and led to promises of a “full investigation” from justice minister Gideon Sa’ar. The State Comptroller’s office also said it was looking into the matter. On Wednesday, the Ynet news website followed up with claims that Pegasus was used for investigations in the corruption case of Likud party Knesset member David Bitan. While the majority of the new allegations correlate with the tenure of Israel’s previous government, Barlev, a Netanyahu critic who took office as part of a new government that ousted him in June, said he believed he had been “told the truth” by the police over whether they had used Pegasus on Israeli citizens. “There might always be an exceptional case, that one or two try to go around the rules and do something that is illegal. So first of all, if this happened, it’s illegal. And secondly, this is what is being checked. “If what happened is really what was described in the newspaper, it’s unforgivable.” Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, an expert at the Israel Democracy Institute thinktank, said: “You can’t really ask for a court order authorising Pegasus” because Israeli law does not currently permit such invasive surveillance of its citizens. “It is now clear that the current Protection of Privacy Law is not equipped to cope with today’s reality,” she told Agence France-Presse.",News/World news,Israeli minister defends police over alleged Pegasus spying,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/israeli-minister-defends-police-over-alleged-pegasus-spying
1/20/2022,"Good morning. Australia’s Covid response turns “from purposeful to parody”, a leading epidemiologist calls for blood testing to assess full spread of the Omicron strain, and conservative British MPs urge their own PM to go. A Sydney woman suffering spinal muscular atrophy has spent $1,300 on rapid antigen tests in order to ensure that her carers won’t represent a risk to her contracting Covid-19. Carolyn Campbell-McLean says the NDIS won’t cover the cost of RATs for people who live in their own homes. The 47-year-old is unable to get out bed, shower or go to the toilet without carer support. She hasn’t left the home she shares with her husband since 15 December due to the surge of Omicron cases.  A leading epidemiologist has called for widespread blood testing to help understand the full extent of Omicron’s spread across Australia, as case numbers continue to spiral, with nearly 80,000 new infections and 67 deaths recorded on Wednesday. Seroprevalence surveys were conducted in 2020 and 2021, and a fresh round could help more accurately determine rates of immunity within the broader community. Meanwhile, the sharp rise in infections has sparked a surging demand for pulse oximeters – devices used to measure the rate of oxygen in the bloodstream – which can help alert as to the potential severity of a coronavirus infection. And as the hospital system continues to strain under the Covid demand, Peter Hannam writes the prioritising of economics over medical advice represents “the moment Australia’s response to Covid turned from purposeful to a parody”. Boris Johnson is facing intense pressure to resign as UK prime minister, with a senior leader from within his own party echoing advice given to Neville Chamberlain, urging Johnson: “in the name of God, go”. Former Brexit secretary David Davis told media “I expect my leaders to shoulder the responsibility for the actions they take. Yesterday [Johnson] did the opposite of that”. Johnson has been dogged by a series of missteps in recent months, but his attempts to explain away revelations that he attended a party at 10 Downing St during lockdown have seen his standing plummet, with one Tory MP defecting to the opposition Labour party. Australia’s reliance on foreign satellites could have dire consequences for domestic security, scientists from the Australian Academy of Science have warned, with defence planning and food production currently heavily reliant on data from foreign-owned satellites.

Relative to the start of the Covid pandemic the job market is looking quite rosy for many young Australians. But a significant factor in this is the absence of hundreds of thousands of overseas backpackers which is why the prime minister is on a push to entice them back to Australia, Greg Jericho explains. “While the labour force figures and other economic data are yet to return to normal, what must not return is the plethora of wage theft and abuse directed to those here on short-term visas, all done in the name of curing labour shortages.” Yoga, a cup of hot milk, mindfulness – there are a plethora of theories about how to help yourself prepare for a good night’s sleep. But as Maddie Thomas writes, a simpler, and more effective solution may have been staring at us, all along: the humble book. “In 2009 the University of Sussex conducted research that found reading a book reduced stress levels by 68%, outperforming other activities like going for a walk or having a cup of tea.” You only need to do so for six minutes, the research argues, but if you happen to read longer you might also work through that bedside pile.

1/20/2022,"Boris Johnson’s decision to remove all plan B measures in England – and to signal the end of the legal requirement to self-isolate – comes as the Omicron surge in the UK appears to have peaked. The move means compulsory mask wearing in shops and on public transport, guidance to work from home and vaccine certificates will be scrapped in England next week, with the need to self-isolate lapsing on 24 March if not before.  What impact will this have on the epidemic? One question scientists have yet to nail is the extent to which different factors are driving infections down. High levels of immunity due to vaccines, boosters and runaway infections play a big role, but that protection is more effective against hospitalisation and death than against catching the virus. Another major force that has shaped the Omicron wave is people’s behaviour, which extends far beyond plan B. Monitoring by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) showed this week that people reduced their contacts throughout the autumn and have kept them low in December and January, with adults reporting fewer than three contacts a day. There is plenty of room for socialising, and infections, to bound back. Many epidemiologists expect infections will pick up again in England. Modelling from the University of Warwick suggests that such a rise could drive an “exit wave” of hospitalisations in April and May. Admissions are unlikely to reach the levels hit this winter, but one concern is that the rise in cases could coincide with waning booster immunity in older and more vulnerable people. Hospitalisations are not the only issue: there is still huge uncertainty around how much Omicron will increase the prevalence of long Covid. Behaviour has helped Omicron peak in other ways, too. In the run-up to Christmas, routine lateral flow testing became widespread and a large proportion of reported cases were detected that way. If people interpret falling cases as the end of the crisis – and scrapping the legal requirement for self-isolation might encourage that view – they may pose a greater risk to others. “I suspect this has been one of the most important contributors to the Omicron wave being smaller than predicted,” said Prof Mark Woolhouse, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Edinburgh University. “This is particularly important for anyone planning a contact with a vulnerable person and will remain so for the foreseeable future, in my view.” While cases are falling at the UK level, the picture is mixed nationally and regionally. It is unclear whether infections are falling in Northern Ireland, or in north-east and south-west England, for example. Going into the spring, more fine-grained data is going to be crucial to reveal whether Omicron is holding on, or has begun to rise again, in particular areas. “We shouldn’t be looking at averages any more,” said Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at LSHTM and a member of the Independent Sage group. “There are still a hell of a lot of people not vaccinated in the UK. There are parts of the country where a lot of people are living in very difficult circumstances, with overcrowding and all the conditions where the virus spreads, and I am very worried about that.” How Covid persists in different age groups will also be important to monitor. As of last week, infections were falling in all age groups in England except children aged two to 11 – the unvaccinated young – prompting concerns about Covid in schools. Boris Johnson’s announcement means that from Thursday staff and pupils in schools in England will not be required to wear masks in classrooms. They will continue to wear them in communal areas until next Thursday, and where there are significant outbreaks public health directors can recommend a return to face masks. Face coverings have been a source of growing dispute in schools, as heads have struggled to enforce the latest government advice. Many school leaders will be glad to see them go but there is concern in the sector that the announcement is premature with cases still high in some areas. “Removing measures such as masks in schools is crazy,” said Prof Stephen Reicher, a behavioural scientist at the University of St Andrews who advises Sage and Independent Sage. “This has much more to do with appeasing those who might otherwise be writing to the 1922 Committee [to try to oust the prime minister].” Behavioural scientists have shown throughout the crisis, and in previous pandemics, that people act according to the risk they perceive. Telling people they will no longer have to self-isolate sends a message that “it’s all over”, said Reicher. “This will impact all behaviours including – critically – the need to get vaccinated and boosted. The government’s approach will undermine even the steps they still acknowledge are important.”",News/Politics,Removal of Covid rules in UK risks premature signal of victory,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/removal-of-covid-rules-in-uk-risks-premature-signal-of-victory
1/20/2022,"In the days when he combined the job of Tory MP with editing the Spectator magazine, Boris Johnson was forced to go to Liverpool to apologise following the publication of a gratuitously offensive editorial about the city. Later, revealing his true feelings, he derided the episode as “Operation Scouse-grovel”. But the faux-contrition did the trick. In his biography of Mr Johnson, the journalist Andrew Gimson writes: “The Liverpool debacle did no lasting damage. It amused a great number of people and made him even more famous.” Faced with a nation’s outrage during a public health crisis, Mr Johnson appears to have believed he could get away with a similarly disingenuous approach. Unable to deny that he attended a lockdown-breaking drinks party in the garden of Downing Street, the prime minister has issued grovelling apologies while deploying sophistry to evade the consequences of his actions. His latest self-exculpatory move – made during an abject interview with Sky television – was to suggest that no one in No 10 warned him that the May 2020 party broke Covid rules. The language chosen was deliberately specific, failing to rule out warnings of a more general kind; but in essence Mr Johnson asked the country to swallow the idea that he was the only person in Downing Street who did not understand what was taking place on 20 May. It is a proposition so shamelessly implausible that one senses that even Mr Johnson does not expect it to be believed.  The question thus becomes what the Conservative party intends to do about a leader who has brought the government into disrepute, and betrayed the nation’s trust at a time of crisis. In the House of Commons on Wednesday, the senior Tory MP David Davis echoed the words used to dispatch a previous Tory prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, in 1940, telling Mr Johnson: “In the name of God, go.” It was an appropriate message for a prime minister whose cavalier approach to the lockdown rules he himself set confirms an unfitness for office. The defection of a northern Tory MP to Labour also testified to the extent to which Mr Johnson’s authority is draining away. But while the prime minister’s behaviour has succeeded in uniting MPs from different party factions against him, there is disunity over how to proceed. Some MPs, particularly among the 2019 election intake, favour moving to a vote of no confidence and a possible leadership contest immediately; others wish to wait to hear Sue Gray’s report on the Downing Street parties before acting. Those with ambitions to succeed Mr Johnson as prime minister, such as the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, and the foreign secretary, Liz Truss, would doubtless prefer more time to prepare their challenge. This internal division and indecision is currently allowing the prime minister to survive from day to day. Despite plunging poll ratings and a shot reputation, Mr Johnson clearly remains determined to brazen out “partygate” if he possibly can, hoping that Wednesday’s lifting of Covid plan B restrictions will help his cause. As he staggers on, populist policy is being made on the hoof – from bashing the BBC to deploying the Royal Navy to confront migrants – in an attempt to shore up Mr Johnson’s position. It is a dismal, unsustainable state of affairs: a prime minister whose attempts to evade responsibility for his actions have not worked sits tight and hopes for the best; a party that has been too long in power calculates how to hold on to it once he has gone. As Britain faces the headwinds of a cost of living crisis, and attempts to navigate a successful exit from the Covid pandemic, it requires a prime minister it can respect and, at a basic level, trust. It does not have one.",Opinion/Opinion,The Guardian view on Boris Johnson and ‘partygate’: all played out | Editorial,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/19/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-and-partygate-all-played-out
1/20/2022,"The economic news this week is stark. Inflation has hit a 30-year high and the average British worker is entering their third drop in real wages in a decade. But what’s really sobering is that the worst is still to come. Next month, the regulator Ofgem announces the maximum price for heating bills, and energy company bosses are already warning that they will almost certainly be double last winter’s levels. The new price cap kicks in from April, at just the point that national insurance goes up alongside council tax increases in many boroughs, and there’s a stealth rise in income tax. If government ministers think they’re unpopular now, they should check back once voters are paying what economists estimate as an extra £1,200 a year for the average household. Without immediate state action, the human fallout of all of this will be severe. Two big points need to be borne in mind: first, when basics are shooting up in price, households cannot put off their purchases or buy something cheaper. You either switch the heating on or not; you either have enough food or you go hungry. Second, although prices are going up for everyone, not all families have the same financial buffer against this storm. As it is, debt charities are already warning of many more people trying to borrow to keep on top of their bills. Fuel poverty looks almost certain to shoot up.  What should be done immediately has been sketched out by Labour’s Rachel Reeves: a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, with the proceeds going towards the least well-off to help with bills. Labour is also proposing scrapping VAT on fuel bills for a few months, which makes better sense politically than it does in policy terms. The amount households save would be small and financial support should be better targeted. In any case, it would not be a surprise to see the business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, steal one or both of these ideas. What he should also do, but won’t, is restore the £20 cut from universal credit and increase benefits, which are not going up in line with prices. Still, Labour should continue to press the government on this policy. Much more of a mistake would be for Whitehall to hand money to utility firms, as has been suggested: that hands money to shareholders rather than to households. Over the longer term, the state needs to build up a much bigger renewables base so that the UK is less dependent on international oil and gas markets. What doesn’t help is for the Bank of England to raise interest rates again, as looks likely. There is no evidence of workers pushing for higher wages, but there are already signs of companies raising their prices in line with their material costs. A quarter-point increase in the base rate will do nothing to prevent that, nor will it curb fluctuations on international oil markets. All it does is signal a certain complacency on Threadneedle Street about the prospects for the UK economy, which are not that rosy.

1/20/2022,"A US Senate candidate from Louisiana has shared a campaign video in which he smokes marijuana in an effort to “destigmatize” its use and raise awareness about racial justice. Gary Chambers Jr, a 37-year-old Democrat and social justice advocate from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, is shown seated outdoors in a chair, taking puffs from a blunt.  “My first campaign ad, ‘37 Seconds.’ #JustLikeMe,” Chambers tweeted on Tuesday in a caption for the ad, which has spread widely on social media. In it, he recites arrest statistics of Black Americans and marijuana possession. “Every 37 seconds, someone is arrested for possession of marijuana. Since 2010, police have arrested an estimated 7.3 million Americans for violating marijuana laws,” Chambers says, to the sound effect of a ticking clock. “Black people are four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana laws than white people.” He adds: “States waste $3.7bn enforcing marijuana laws every year. Most of the people police are arresting aren’t dealers, but rather people with small amounts of pot, just like me.” Writing about the campaign video, Chambers said: “I hope this ad works not only to destigmatize the use of marijuana, but also forces a new conversation that creates the pathway to legalize this beneficial drug, and forgive those who were arrested due to outdated ideology.” In a statement to CNN, he elaborated that it was “long past due that politicians stop pretending to be better or different than the people they represent”, adding: “Some parts of the country are fighting opioid addictions and creating millionaires and better schools from the marijuana industry. Others are creating felonies and destroyed families. I can’t stand for that.’” According to Chambers’ campaign, the ad was shot over the weekend in New Orleans, a city that just recently passed a law to decriminalize marijuana possession. The city council also added a blanket pardon for marijuana possession convictions dating back to 2010, which the council members said would apply to about 10,000 old cases. Last June, the Louisiana governor, John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, signed a bill into law that reduces the penalty for possessing small amounts of marijuana, and at the beginning of this month lawmakers legalized the “smokable” form of medical marijuana under certain conditions. Chambers is seeking to challenge Republican senator John Kennedy, a staunch conservative and Donald Trump ally, in November’s all-party primary.",News/US news,Louisiana Senate candidate goes viral for smoking marijuana in campaign ad,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/19/louisiana-senate-candidate-gary-chambers-jr-marijuana-campaign-ad
1/20/2022,"The “pork pie putsch”, named in reference to Alicia Kearns, the Melton Mowbray MP allegedly seeking to topple Boris Johnson, is part of a long tradition of British political conspiracy. It is the lot of a modern British prime minister not just to govern, but to survive relentless internal intrigue, some hatched in Midlands curry houses, some in Commons tearooms, and some in country houses or on the boundaries of a Test match at Lord’s.  Some plots come into the open at the moment the conspirators planned, others are unmasked prematurely by party whips delighted that early exposure will prove fatal. Some surprisingly succeed, such as the ousting of Margaret Thatcher, while others, such as the one launched by two former cabinet ministers in 2009 against Gordon Brown, evaporate the day they are launched. But the extent to which plots can preoccupy Downing Street is hard to exaggerate. Harold Wilson, often for good reason, was preoccupied by conspiracies to oust him. Lord Marsh, then a court favourite, recalled when he was summoned to the Downing Street flat: “You would sit there for an hour or so and then you would be questioned closely about plots and what Desmond Donnelly or Austen Albu were up to. He distrusted everybody.” Wilson became so paranoid that he planted stories that Roy Jenkins, Jim Callaghan, and Anthony Crosland had attended a conspiratorial weekend in July 1966 at Ann Fleming’s house in Sevenhampton. Jenkins had indeed been at the house (“in moments of crisis people are caught in characteristic poses”, as Susan Crosland described it), but no other Labour politician had. Such was Wilson’s determination to reveal plots that dissident cells were structured in the parliamentary party on the model of a liberation army. An inner group of nine or 10 MPs was charged with forming a constellation of a smaller group. The dissidents’ gathering of intelligence – over secretive drinks – often sounded more efficient than the reality, according to one of them, David Marquand. He recalled: “When the inner group met, we used to say things like, ‘I have spoken to two and don’t know about the rest’, and somebody would write down Bloggs Unknown. It was all quite ridiculous.” At a May Day rally at the Royal Festival Hall in 1969, Wilson finally confronted the plotters, saying: “I know what is going on.” His biographer, Ben Pimlott, wrote: “There was audible intake of breath as the audience feared some paranoid rambling,” but instead Wilson said to laughter: “I am going on. Your government is going on.” He told the plotters and defeatists to “climb into bed and pull the blankets over their heads and not hinder the rest of us”. The prize for most ineffective plot was one mounted by Margaret Hodge and Geoff Hoon to oust Gordon Brown, known as the “great goose plot” owing to it being hatched in Hodge’s Suffolk country house over roast goose. Others dubbed it the “pashmina plot” owing to its middle-class origins. It lasted a few hours and had all the momentum of a clamped car. Hoon, defence secretary during the Iraq war, had been planning to oust Brown since November 2009, some say because Brown had not offered him a plum job as a European commissioner. Only six months earlier, in 2009, James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary, had walked out of cabinet hoping to trigger a revolt, including by his friend David Miliband. The Hoon plot, also discussed with Patricia Hewitt at Gandhi’s, an Indian restaurant in London, got off to a shaky start when Hoon’s office mistakenly sent a mysterious blank email to Labour MPs at 10.59am. An apology followed and the real coup email was issued at 12.26pm – just as prime minister’s questions ended, a poor moment since Brown had put on a particularly effective performance. They called for the leadership issue to be resolved “once and for all”. Promised heavyweight cabinet support, only silence and then derision followed. Hoon, asked on Newsnight that night whether if he had been Brutus, Caesar would have survived, said: “I am afraid he would.” The hoped for “Et tu, Harriet?” never came. Another ill-executed plot was against Tony Blair, by Tom Watson, a defence minister and one of Brown’s acolytes. It emerged that the day before Watson delivered a letter calling for Blair to resign he had been in Brown’s house in Scotland. Watson claimed he had been staying at a luxury golf resort in St Andrews and, being in the area, popped into the chancellor’s house to deliver (and watch) some Postman Pat videos with Brown’s young son. Watson’s explanation became even less sustainable when it emerged he had been in a curry house in Wolverhampton with a group of ringleaders the night before the journey to Scotland. The “balti house” or “curry house conspiracy” was revealed when the Mail on Sunday discovered the MPs had signed the owner’s visitors’ book – leaving glowing reviews and incontrovertible evidence they had dined together. Until more recent times, the Conservative party tried to behead its leaders with dignity. Harold Macmillan was “persuaded to retire” by the legendary men in grey suits after he suffered a curable prostate problem. He complained of 20 malcontents. “Some few will be content with the success they have had in the assassination of their leader and will not care very much who the successor is.” But by the end of his prime ministership, he cut a lonely figure, reportedly taking refuge in West End clubs to an almost pathological extent: Pratt’s, Athenaeum, Buck’s, Guards, the Beefsteak, the Turf, the Carlton. A member of Pratt’s calling in one evening in the 1960s inquired if anyone was there that night. “Nobody at all, sir, only the prime minister.” John Major in 1995 was blessed by his challenger being John Redwood, who gathered the courage to take up Major’s back-me or sack-me challenge in a conversation at Lord’s cricket ground. The European Research Group that prematurely tried to oust Theresa May in a 2019 vote of no confidence largely operated in the open in a madhouse parliament. Some cabinet ministers were more discreet, operating as the “pizza plot”, a group of five. Although they never secured their objective, May’s defeat, they did manage to force her to say she would be gone by the next election.",News/Politics,Pork pie putsch and curry coup: the history of Downing Street plots,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/pork-pie-putsch-and-curry-coup-the-history-of-downing-street-plots
