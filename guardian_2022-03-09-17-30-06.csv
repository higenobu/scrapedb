3/9/2022,"The outcome of Zoe Daniel’s campaign’s challenge against a Victorian council ban on supporters putting up signs in their yards before the federal election has been called will have ramifications for the entire state, the judge hearing the case says. The independent candidate for Goldstein’s campaign manager, Keith Badger, has challenged a ruling by Bayside city council earlier this month that signs cannot be erected until within three months of an election. State bylaws say signs may only be displayed for 14 days after an event or three months in total. The council backflipped on an earlier ruling after Liberal incumbent MP, Tim Wilson, pointed out the highly unlikely scenario of an election being held as late as 3 September, meaning signs could not be put up until 3 June. The Daniel campaign has pointed out that other councils have interpreted this law differently, and signs are allowed in other electorates, including the neighbouring electorate of Kooyong, held by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. Justice John Dixon noted in a hearing on Wednesday that his decision would affect what was allowed in those other electorates. “Whatever I determine in relation to this has a full effect across the state of Victoria,” he said, noting he had seen signs in his own suburb the previous night. “It really doesn’t matter what other councils have done. They don’t even need to be on notice about this but the consequence would be the decision was made to issue the declaration or not issue the declaration in Mr Badger’s favour will have implications across the state,” he said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Counsel acting for the Daniel campaign, Jonathan Evans, argued that the sign is not advertising the event of the election, but Daniel as a candidate, and wouldn’t be covered by the law for event signage. Evans argued that it was “absurd” to apply the laws to small signs that can be affixed to trees or the fence of someone’s home, given it would mean that signs protesting the climate crisis or war in Ukraine could also be covered by the law. The campaign has argued if the bylaws do cover such signs, then it should accommodate the implied freedom of political expression. Dixon noted that holding a half Senate election separate from the House of Representatives – the only way to avoid a May federal election – would be “in the terms of political journalists that would be suicide” . He said that is entirely the discretion of the prime minister but there remains uncertainty around when it will be held, making it harder to wrap a “political event” in with religious or cultural events which have a set date known well in advance. Evans noted that writs for the election can be issued with as little as 33 days notice, meaning if the council’s interpretation of the law holds, the Daniel campaign would only be able to put up signs for 47 days, giving the incumbent – who they argue is better known in the electorate – an advantage. Counsel for Bayside council, Emrys Nekvapil, argued the rules were designed to protect the “visual amenity” of the area. “Signs have a particular capacity to change the visual landscape. And so it’s not surprising in that sense that they are regulated by the planning law of this state,” he said. Nekvapil argued the signs were promoting an event, that is, the upcoming election for the federal seat of Goldstein. Dixon reserved his judgment, and the council took an undertaking not to enforce the current rule in the meantime.",News/Australia news,"Zoe Daniel’s court challenge over sign ban ‘will have ramifications for the entire state’, says judge",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/zoe-daniels-court-challenge-over-sign-ban-will-have-ramifications-for-the-entire-state-says-judge
3/9/2022,"“Has a goalkeeper ever received a red card for time-wasting?” wonders Bogdan Kotarlic. Adi Zakamowicz wastes no times in answering this one. “Yes, it happened pretty recently. In this season’s edition of Israel’s Toto Cup (our version of the Carabao Cup), in a match against Hapoel Hadera on 21 August 2021, goalkeeper Danny Amos of Maccabi Netanya was given a second yellow card for time-wasting in the 92nd minute, after he received a first yellow for time-wasting in the 85th minute. Therefore, a red card was shown to Amos, and full-back Karem Jaber replaced him in goal for the last minutes of added time, keeping the score at 2-0 in favour of Maccabi Netanya.” Another goalkeeper who received his marching orders for running down the clock was Iván Cuéllar while at Leganés. Daniel Bickermann writes: “In 2020 Cuéllar received his second yellow and thus a red card in the 93rd minute of their 0-0 draw with Atlético Madrid. Since Leganés had already used up all their substitutes, left-back Jonathan Silva put on the green jersey for the remaining seconds.” And if we go off-piste somewhat, Daniel adds: “Schalke manager David Wagner got a very controversial straight red in extra-time for time-wasting during a cup game against Hertha Berlin, when he seemingly helped up Hertha’s Jordan Torunarigha after he crashed into the Schalke bench. After a VAR review, the referee gave Wagner a red card and explained he was preventing a fast continuation of play.” We have plucked out a couple of examples involving fun and games in South America. There was controversy on 4 January 1977 when the Uruguayan referee Héctor Rodriguez sent off Ecuador’s goalkeeper Carlos Delgado for time-wasting five minutes into the second half against … Uruguay, who were trailing 1-0 in a friendly. Uruguay equalised soon after before Rodriguez went card-crazy, sending off another three Ecuador players in the 78th minute as they made clear their grievance before the match was abandoned amid a melee. And there was chaos in an Ecuadorian top-flight match on 1 November 2014 when Barcelona’s keeper Máximo Banguera was given a second yellow for time-wasting as early as the 42nd minute. As the substitute goalkeeper Damian Lanza was waiting to replace him, he made baseless accusations against the referee which led to him being sent off before he had even come on. Cue a mass brawl which needed riot police. The match restarted and Barcelona’s nine men did well to lose only 2-1 as two outfield players took turns in goal for the remaining 48 minutes. “The Carabao Cup final featured 22 penalties in the shootout, of which 21 were scored and one was missed,” notes Athena Blight. “Has there ever been a longer shootout where not a single penalty was saved?” “On 4 February 2006, the Africa Cup of Nations quarter-final between Cameroon and Ivory Coast went to penalties,” writes Chris Fowler. “Even the goalkeepers scored, before one of the first penalties of the second time around was missed. So the sequence was 22 scored, one missed or 23 penalties without, as far as I can remember, anyone missing.” We’ve looked into this and discovered that Samuel Eto’o was the Cameroon player who shanked the 23rd penalty over, allowing Didier Drogba to fire home the winning spot-kick. But David Cartwright believes the record for the number of consecutive shoot-our penalties scored before one was missed took place in the Hampshire Senior Cup. “It is thought that 29 were taken in a game between between Brockenhurst and Andover Town on 9 October 2013. Brockenhurst won 15-14.” We have video of the shootout, in which Andover’s Claudio Herbert saw his kick – the 30th – saved. Although this may be a record, there was a save eventually, so the example from above better answers Athena’s question. “I make it about three minutes and 40 seconds between Sébastien Haller’s own goal and his goal against Benfica,” tweets Nayson. “What’s the smallest gap between a player scoring at both ends of the pitch?” There are many members of the “scored at both ends” club but finding a player who has done it quicker than the Ajax striker did is tricky. Robert Davies wrote in with a player who matched Haller’s three minutes, but we can’t confirm whether he was faster or slower. Either way, it was an eventful match for Walsall’s Conor Wilkinson in the 3-3 draw with Newport on 1 January this year. Here’s the rundown: 52 min: Came on as sub53 min: Scored with first touch56 min: Scored own goal90+5min: Scored equaliser We also remember Troy Deeney going from hero to villain within three minutes when he equalised for Watford against Manchester United in the 87th minute in November 2015, before putting through his own net in the 90th. And a doff of the cap to Tammy Abraham, who scored a hat-trick for Chelsea before adding an own goal 14 minutes later during their 5-2 win over Wolves in 2019. “Your article from 6 February 2013 asked about the biggest away following at a football ground,” writes Ross Taylor … “I would like to offer Truro City v Torquay United in the Conference South from 2019. Truro were groundsharing at Torquay’s Plainmoor, resulting in a mere 200-mile round trip for home games. As a result, they were averaging fewer than 200 at home, with a low of 86 against Hemel Hempstead in October 2018. When they met on New Year’s Day 2019 at Plainmoor for Truro’s designated home match, the crowd was 2,812, made up of 2,760 Torquay ‘away’ fans and 52 Truro ‘home’ fans, or 98.1% away fans.” “Spurs v Pompey saw six players playing against their old club – Jermain Defoe, Peter Crouch and Niko Kranjcar for Spurs, plus Michael Brown, Younes Kaboul and Kevin-Prince Boateng for Pompey,” noted Eliot Crowe in October 2009. “Is this a record?” We headed to the League of Ireland for the answer. “Having almost gone bust in 2008 Drogheda United ended up throwing together a cheap squad for the 2009 season,” wrote Sean DeLoughrey. “They signed no fewer than seven of the squad players released by promotion-winning local rivals Dundalk. Drogheda already had two ex-Dundalk players. When the Louth rivals met Drogheda started with six ex-Dundalk players (Steve Williams, Robbie Clarke, Jamie Duffy, Paul Shiels, David O’Connor, Robbie Martin) and two further ex-Dundalk players (Ian Ryan and Robbie Farrell) came off the bench. Dundalk featured former Drogheda player Declan O’Brien for a total of nine players playing against their former team. Dundalk won 3-0.” “When was the last time a manager in the English top flight was relegated and then kept their job until they brought the same club back up?” wonders Anthony McGlennon. Wonder what the least number of appearances for a club has resulted in a testimonial? Must be a back up goalkeeper surely?Come on @TheKnowledge_GU you’ll know. “A lot of questions go unanswered,” begins Eugene Francis. “I feel this will be one: has a goalkeeper ever taken a corner?” Have any player-managers subbed themselves on and gone on to score a decisive goal (equaliser or winner?) “Given that the player of the match is usually announced around the 89th minute, what is the worst-ever performance of one after the announcement has been made,” wonders Andrew Chambers.

3/9/2022,"Sky Vegas has been fined £1.2m for sending free casino “spins” to recovering addicts during the industry’s annual Safer Gambling Week. The fine comes at a sensitive time for the British gambling industry, which has been at pains to show it has improved its attitude to social responsibility. The government is in the midst of a landmark review of how the sector is regulated, with proposals due to be published in a white paper expected within weeks. Yet major brands have been hit with a series of penalties for failing to protect vulnerable people in recent weeks. 888 Casino, which is in the process of buying William Hill’s UK assets, was fined £9.4m last week over multiple failings that led to customers racking up huge losses during the depths of the Covid pandemic. BetVictor was fined £2m in February for failures in fairness, money-laundering controls and social responsibility. The new fine for Sky Vegas, owned by the global gambling firm Flutter, comes after it sent a promotional offer of “Bet £5 get 100 free spins” to 41,395 customers who had voluntarily self-excluded from gambling in an effort to stop. A further 249,159 customers who had unsubscribed from the operator’s marketing emails also received the promotion. “Here at Sky Vegas, we love the unexpected,” one marketing email read. “That’s right. Simply opt in, spend £5 and claim your 100 free spins. The best part? Whatever you win is yours to keep – that’s the fun in fair!” The promotional message featured graphics of slot machines and the slogan: “Entertainment like no other.” The incident, revealed by the Guardian in November last year, led addicts to warn that receiving such messages could have triggered a relapse. Andrew Rhodes, the Gambling Commission’s chief executive, said: “Self-excluded customers are likely to be suffering gambling harm and should absolutely not be sent direct marketing that could tempt them back into gambling. “We would advise all operators to learn from Sky Betting & Gaming’s costly errors and ensure their systems are robust enough to always prevent the self-excluded, and those who have clearly rejected marketing, from receiving promotional material. “This latest fine would have been a lot higher had Sky Betting & Gaming allowed any of the self-excluded customers to actually gamble, failed to cooperate, and not taken decisive action aimed at preventing a repeat.” Conor Grant, the chief executive of Flutter UK and Ireland, said the company “takes its responsibility to protect customers extremely seriously but on this occasion we did not do enough”. He added: “As soon as the error was identified, we ceased communications until the fault could be rectified, notified regulators and apologised to the affected customers. We also conducted a thorough investigation into what went wrong, the results of which were provided to regulators, and have put in place measures to ensure that this cannot happen again. We accept the Gambling Commission’s findings and once again apologise to those customers who we let down.”",News/Society,Sky Vegas fined £1.2m for sending free casino ‘spins’ to recovering addicts,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/mar/09/sky-vegas-fined-for-sending-free-casino-spins-to-recovering-addicts
3/9/2022,"Environmental groups have linked the beaching of three whales in Corfu to seismic testing for oil and gas in the waters off the Greek island. Two Cuvier’s beaked whales were found stranded at Arillas and Agios Gordios beaches on the west of the island on 20 February. A third beaked whale ran ashore on Agios Gordios beach the day after. “It took dozens of volunteers over five hours using rudimentary ropes to hoist the whales back in the sea,” said local vet Nastazia Koronaki, who helped coordinate the rescue efforts. Beached whales are not unknown in Greece, but for three healthy whales to be stranded on the same coastline within such a short space of time is unusual, said Koronaki. While it has not been established what caused the whales to become stranded, environmental groups suspect the beachings were connected to SW Cook, a ship commissioned by oil company Hellenic Petroleum, which has been conducting testing in the Ionian Sea off the Corfu coastline. This region includes the Hellenic trench and the Ionian Sea archipelago, which have been designated important marine mammal areas. Seismic testing is a method of oil and gas exploration that involves continuously blasting the seafloor with airguns to map the fossil fuels below. These blasts can reach more than 250 decibels. The effect of these sound levels on marine mammals is “like a bomb repeatedly going off in their home every 10 seconds – a home they can’t flee”, according to US non-profit the National Resources Defense Council. Research has linked seismic testing to a range of negative impacts in marine animals, including hearing impairment, difficulties with feeding and interference with communication. In beaked whales, which are deep divers, studies have found links between seismic testing and decompression sickness. The whale beachings were “probably only the tip of the iceberg,” said Nicolas Entrup, director of international relations at the non-profit OceanCare. “Many more animals, and not only whales, may have been harmed. Animals exposed to this intense sound may get killed and sink to the bottom of the sea.” Last month, the two environmental organisations, along with other non-profits, wrote to the Greek prime minister calling for a halt to seismic testing until the cause of the whale beachings can be established. Greenpeace also sent its ship, Rainbow Warrior III, to monitor SW Cook. According to reports, the seismic surveys were paused after the beachings and the SW Cook has now left Greece, said Dimitris Ibrahim, climate officer at WWF Greece. Hellenic Petroleum did not respond to requests for comment. The beachings have also raised awareness of the larger issue of oil and gas exploration in the Ionian Sea. Photos and videos of stranded whales spread quickly on social media and questions have been asked in parliament by Greece’s opposition Syriza party. A protest on Corfu brought together environmental activists and tourism industry workers. “People are really scared because we live from tourism, and this could destroy the local economy,” said Giannis Gasteratos, one of those protesting on the island. The Ionian Sea is notoriously deep and tectonically active, which could make any potential oil and gas extraction extremely risky. Even if oil and gas reserves were detected, Greece would not have the infrastructure to exploit them until about 2030, said Ibrahim. “It is crazy that we are even considering extracting fossil fuels that far in the future. It is disastrous from a climate standpoint and makes no sense in the context of the Paris agreement.” Environmental oversight in Greece has been “seriously degraded” over the past few years, Ibrahim said. All that is required for seismic testing is an environmental action plan, he said, “which is private, requires no approval by the state, no public consultation, and which the company is under no obligation to publish”. Kostis Grimanis, spokesperson for Greenpeace Greece, called the seismic surveys “a death sentence for many marine animals”. He added: “You shouldn’t be jeopardising the marine environment, especially for a country that uses its azure seas for tourism. Oil and gas need to remain in the seafloor and we have to invest in renewables.”",News/Environment,Stranding of three whales in Corfu raises alarm over seismic testing for fossil fuels,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/corfu-whales-stranded-seismic-testing-fossil-fuels
3/9/2022,"An Indigenous teenager is fighting for his life in a Darwin hospital after allegedly being shot at by a police officer six times during an incident in the Northern Territory city of Palmerston. Two officers attended a park in the suburb of Gray about 9am on Tuesday morning where they found the man allegedly armed with a spear, NT police said. Assistant commissioner Michael White alleged on Wednesday that the 19-year-old from Palmerston attempted to throw the weapon at police officers. White said the officers called on the man to drop the weapon, after which one officer pulled out a taser and the other fired six rounds of bullets. Both were wearing body cameras at the time of the incident. “At this stage, we’re not sure how many shots struck the person in hospital,” White said. “It will form a major part of the investigation as would the distance between the man and the officer at the time the shots were fired.” The man was taken to Darwin hospital where he underwent surgery. A hospital spokesperson said he remained in a critical condition on Wednesday afternoon. “We certainly know today that his condition has improved from his injuries and the work that the hospital has done to provide all the care necessary to him is nothing but exceptional,” White said. “We’re providing all assistance available to all members involved in the shooting – all members who responded to it and more broadly we’ve reached out to the family and are doing everything we can to engage with them … to ensure they have a full appreciation of what occurred.” White said a critical incident investigation had been launched into why the man was allegedly armed and the response of the officers. All oversight bodies had been briefed. The investigation will examine the use of force by officers, including what other options were considered or deployed. Investigators will liaise with the injured man’s family and the wider Indigenous community. White said at least 45 detectives were currently working on the investigation, door knocking and examining the scene of the incident with forensic analysis. Roads were closed around the scene of the shooting on Tuesday night, while on Wednesday morning the immediate area was cordoned off. White said police also worked with a school nearby to ensure all students returned home safely amid ongoing activity at the scene. “What occurred yesterday was a critical event where police used potentially lethal force to subdue a person,” White said. “Clearly that can cause angst in the community and we’re doing everything we can to ensure officer safety, the safety of our families and the community more broadly. “Police are doing everything they can to investigate it and get to the bottom of what occurred so we can assure the community this isn’t going to happen again.” A report released by the Australian Institute of Criminology last year found fatal police shootings were at a record high since documentation began in 1989-1990. The data showed there had been a 78% increase in fatal police shootings Australia-wide between 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. Of the 164 police shootings since 1989-1990, 10 victims were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander peeopl, representing 6.1% of incidents despite Indigenous people accounting for 3.3% of the Australian population. There have been 500 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths in custody in Australia since a royal commission aimed at preventing Indigenous deaths in the justice system was handed down in 1991.",News/Australia news,NT police say officer fired gun six times at Indigenous man allegedly armed with a spear,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/09/nt-police-say-officer-fired-gun-six-times-at-indigenous-man-allegedly-armed-with-a-spear
3/9/2022,"Only a few years ago the Uyghur minority in China was unknown to most people in the west. China’s record on human rights, however, was an open secret, albeit covered in a miasma of hypocrisy by foreign governments intent on expanding their trading opportunities. In the last few years the sites in Xinjiang province where the Uyghur Muslim people are detained have turned into something akin to concentration camps, with between 1 million and 3 million prisoners; the evidence points to a planned programme to erase an entire ethnic identity. Recent years have seen more and more evidence of atrocities against the Uyghurs. As well as mass internment, there are accounts of forced labour, torture, death, disappearances, and the removal of children from their parents to orphanages in order to “de-racinate” them. Satellite and drone evidence has shown that mosques and Muslim burial grounds have been demolished. There are reliable reports of rapes, and of camp doctors sterilising Uyghur women. In 2020 the Jamestown Foundation released a report analysing Chinese government documents, including family planning records, which showed that between 2015 and 2018 forced sterilisations and abortions decreased the birthrate in two of the largest Uyghur prefectures by 84%. We Uyghurs Have No Say comprises a set of essays and articles by the economist and social commentator described by some as “China’s Mandela”, Ilham Tohti, written before he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014. They include a number preserved by dissidents after the website on which they were published was shut down. In his writings, he explains that discrimination against the Uyghur people is not a recent phenomenon, but nor was it always so. Although he is no champion of “command and control” government, he argues that in the period when there was a planned economy, resources were distributed more fairly and equally, creating a positive sense of equality among ethnic groups. The constitution of 1982 and a protective law introduced in 1984 made Xinjiang the Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), allowing its inhabitants to preserve their own written and spoken language, their customs, traditions and religious freedom, and giving them the right to hold key positions in local government. Tohti’s view is that rapid marketisation from the early 2000s destroyed all that potential for the creation of a multi-ethnic society. It brought turbo-charged economic development, accompanied by an influx of Han Chinese migrants and the deliberate marginalisation of Uyghur people. Here was China’s own “left behind” population. In 1949, Han made up 6.7% of the Xinjiang population – by 2008 it was about 40%. Local people have reaped few of the benefits of economic development, and suffer redundancy, poverty and homelessness. The power differential has made it difficult for Uyghurs to find work, which has led to an increase in ethnic opposition to the state and what Tohti calls a tendency towards “splittism” or a yearning for self-determination. The Washington-based Uyghur Human Rights Project has identified 435 Uyghur intellectuals – doctors, poets, journalists and professors – who are currently detained in the camps. Potential community leadership has been crushed. At the same time, the Chinese government’s ideology under President Xi Jinping has increasingly emphasised atheism, introduced intensive hi-tech surveillance throughout China, further centralised state power and engineered a growing Han ethno-nationalism, all of which run counter to the promises of autonomy in the constitution. Tohti, who is clearly a substantial moral figure, tried through his writings to warn the Chinese Communist party of the consequences of leaving a whole ethnic group behind, and failing to respect their human rights and their right to their own identity. He was always clear about his opposition to violence and extremist acts, but his efforts to foster dialogue only led to repeated detentions. In 2014 he was charged with separatism, which led to his life sentence. The Chinese have moved from denying the existence of internment camps to claiming that their purpose is vocational training. They now say that they are part of a counter-terrorism programme to de-radicalise Muslim extremists. Nathan Sales, the former US state department coordinator for counter-terrorism, was clear the camps have nothing to do with terrorism. “Instead, what is going on is … the waging of war on religion … trying to stamp out the ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious identities of the people,” he said. There is little to prevent the camps becoming death camps – yet the international response, even from Muslim-majority countries, has been abysmal. This is partly because more than 70 nations have accepted development funds from China as part of its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative. Indebtedness creates silence. But the UK is not in this position. We just want trade in cheap goods. The genocide convention places a duty on states to prevent genocide; we are not supposed to wait until it takes place. Last December an independent tribunal chaired by Geoffrey Nice QC heard searing, probative evidence and decided that a genocide is in progress.With other parliamentarians, I have raised the issue of the crimes being committed against the Uyghurs and tried to introduce amendments into trade legislation and other acts of parliament. We called for the use of targeted sanctions against Chinese operatives who bear responsibility for these atrocities. This led to the Chinese government imposing sanctions on seven of us and all our family members. I have no summer house on the Yangtze or Chinese investments, so the impact is not great for me personally, but what it showed was that China minds when its human rights record is exposed. Through his writings, Tohti tries to give the Uyghurs a voice. It is a tragic story that speaks volumes about the UK’s current retreat from international law. The government’s repeated mantra is that only a designated court of law should decide whether a genocide is taking place. As a result, China enjoys impunity for grievous crimes. The comparison of Ilham Tohti to Nelson Mandela rings true as regards his moral courage and the absence of bitterness displayed in his writings. Despite the suffering of his people and his own imprisonment, he bears no hatred for the Han population who are pawns in a divisive state strategy. This book, representing rescued fragments of his thought, fills many gaps in our understanding of how we have got to this desperate place. The Uyghur may have no say. We do.

3/9/2022,"For Svitlana Krakovska, Ukraine’s leading climate scientist, it was meant to be the week where eight years of work culminated in a landmark UN report exposing the havoc the climate crisis is causing the world. But then the bombs started to crunch into Kyiv. Krakovska, the head of a delegation of 11 Ukrainian scientists, struggled to help finalize the vast Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report ahead of its release on 28 February even as Russian forces launched their invasion. “I told colleagues that as long as we have the internet and no bombs over our heads we will continue,” she said. But her team, scattered across the country, started to peel away – one had to rush to an air raid shelter in Kharkiv, others decided to flee completely, internet connections spluttered, one close friend of a delegate was killed in the fighting. International colleagues had to express their sympathies and press on with the report. Krakovska’s four children sheltered with her in their Kyiv home as a missile struck a nearby building, emitting an ear-splitting roar. A fire from a separate strike sent up a plume of smoke that blotted the sky. “This blitzkrieg by [Vladimir] Putin is unbelievable, it is terrorism against the Ukrainian people,” she said. Both the invasion and IPCC report crystallized for Krakovska the human, economic and geopolitical catastrophe of fossil fuels. About half of the world’s population is now acutely vulnerable to disasters stemming from the burning of fossil fuels, the IPCC report found, while Russia’s military might is underpinned by wealth garnered from the country’s vast oil and gas reserves. “I started to think about the parallels between climate change and this war and it’s clear that the roots of both these threats to humanity are found in fossil fuels,” said Krakovska. “Burning oil, gas and coal is causing warming and impacts we need to adapt to. And Russia sells these resources and uses the money to buy weapons. Other countries are dependent upon these fossil fuels, they don’t make themselves free of them. This is a fossil fuel war. It’s clear we cannot continue to live this way, it will destroy our civilization.” The IPCC report, described by António Guterres, the UN secretary general, as an “atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership”, is the most comprehensive catalogue yet of the consequences of global heating. Extreme heat and the spread of disease is killing people around the world, about 12 million people are being displaced by floods and droughts each year and the viability of food-producing land is shrinking. But it is the conflict in Ukraine that has caused western governments to hastily attempt to untangle themselves from a reliance upon Russian oil and gas. The EU, which gets about 40% of its gas supply from Russia, is working on a plan to rapidly upscale renewable energy, bolster energy efficiency measures and build liquified natural gas terminals to receive gas from other countries. Joe Biden, meanwhile, has relented to pressure from US lawmakers to ban imports of Russian oil. The ban, the US president said on Tuesday, will deliver a “powerful blow to Putin’s war machine. We will not be part of subsidizing Putin’s war.” Biden said the US will work with Europe on a long-term plan to phase out Russian oil and gas. The halting of imports was urged in an emotional appeal to members of Congress by Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, and is backed by a bipartisan majority of lawmakers. “It’s basically foolish for us to keep buying products and giving money to Putin to be able to use against the Ukrainian people,” said Joe Manchin, the centrist Democratic senator. Others see the ban as a moment to decisively break from fossil fuels altogether. “This moment is a clarion call for the urgent need to transition to domestic clean energy so that we are never again complicit in fossil-fueled conflict,” said Ed Markey, a progressive Democratic senator who was a driving force behind the Green New Deal agenda. But in a stark demonstration of how deeply embedded fossil fuels remain in decision making, Biden’s administration has awkwardly attempted to extol its efforts to confront the climate crisis while also boasting that the US is now drilling more oil than even under Donald Trump to show it is cognizant of public anguish over rising gasoline prices, a perennial political headache for presidents. “We don’t have a strategic interest in reducing the global supply of energy,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said last week. “That would raise prices at the gas pump for the American people, around the world, because it would reduce the supply available.” While the US takes a relatively small amount of oil from Russia – only about 3% of all oil imports – experts say it is telling that an administration vocal about the need to reduce fossil fuels has found it difficult to cut itself from its dependency on oil and gas. “It’s a crude oversimplification to call this a fossil fuel war, that’s a little too glib,” said Jonathan Elkind, an expert in energy policy at Columbia University and a former energy adviser to Barack Obama’s administration. “But it’s an undeniable reality that Russia gets a significant share of its revenues from oil and gas and that America’s gasoline habitat contributes towards the global demand for 100m barrels of oil each day. “Do we want to find ourselves 10 years from now where we’ve bent the curve on oil consumption and emissions towards decarbonization, or do we want to sit there and think ‘where did the last 10 years go?’ If the US isn’t a part of the solution we will put in peril our influence on the world stage and the fate of everyone, both here and around the globe.” While Europe belatedly attempts to wean itself off Russian gas, efforts to phase down fossil fuels in the US have faltered. Biden’s legislative plan to drastically ramp up renewable energy is moribund in Congress, largely thanks to Manchin, while the conservative-leaning supreme court is mulling whether to weaken the administration’s ability to regulate coal-fired power plants. The invasion of Ukraine has also triggered a push by the US oil and gas industry and its allies in Congress to loosen regulations to allow more domestic drilling. Manchin, chair of the Senate energy committee, has said that delaying new gas pipelines when “Putin is actively and effectively using energy as an economic and political weapon against our allies is just beyond the pale”. Even Elon Musk, founder of the electric vehicle company Telsa, has said that “we need to increase oil and gas output immediately. Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures.” The White House has pointed out that the industry is already sitting on a huge number of idle drilling leases – a total of 9,000 unused permits covering 26m acres of American public land – while environmentalists argue the crisis highlights the dangers of being at the mercy of a volatile global oil price, now near an all-time high, rather than shifting towards solar, wind and other sources of clean energy. “The fossil fuel industry’s so-called solution to this crisis is nothing more than a recipe to enable fossil-fueled fascists like Vladimir Putin for years to come,” said Jamal Raad, executive director of Evergreen Action. “As long as our economy is dependent on fossil fuels, we will be at the mercy of petro-dictators who wield their influence on global energy prices like a weapon. “American-made clean energy is affordable, reliable and free from the volatility of oil and gas markets. The best way to weaken Putin’s grip on the global energy market is to get America off of fossil fuels.” In Kyiv, Krakovska has said that she will stay in her home city as the Russian army advances, having declined offers to relocate to foreign research institutions. “I know that’s what Putin wants, for us to flee Ukraine so they can have our beautiful country,” she said. “I have told scientists in other countries I will collaborate with them, but from an independent and free Ukraine. I couldn’t be in another place knowing that Kyiv was in the hands of those barbarians.”",News/Environment,‘This is a fossil fuel war’: Ukraine’s top climate scientist speaks out,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/09/ukraine-climate-scientist-russia-invasion-fossil-fuels
