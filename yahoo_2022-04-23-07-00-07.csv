Earlier this week, a mysterious flying whirlpool was spotted over the Maunakea Observatories in Hawaii. While many speculated about whether it was a UFO or a wormhole, astronomers have offered another explanation.

The legendary Chom Chom Roller pet hair remover is down to just $25 Dr. Marco Langbroek, a technical advisor at the Leiden University astronomy department says the spiral-shaped flying whirlpool isn’t a UFO. Instead, it’s the post-deorbit-burn fuel vent from the upper stage of a SpaceX rocket launched that same day. The rocket in question launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Dr. Langbroek, who is also an author at the SatTrackCam blog, says the deorbit of the rocket’s upper stage hit over the Pacific Ocean. The spiral flying whirlpool is a characteristic mark of the rocket’s post-deorbit burn. While the identity of the mysterious flying whirlpool isn’t exciting as if it was a UFO, it’s still an intriguing site. To see the de-orbit-burn creating such a spectacular spiral is yet another reminder of just how amazing our recent pushes into space have been. This particular rocket was used to launch a NROL-85 spacecraft, which is a spy satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office. While the flying whirlpool sighting is exciting, it’s not really a UFO. As such, while it might look mysterious at first, the anomaly is completely normal. Still, there is something exciting about the prospect of a UFO creating such an effect. Many people spend years of their lives looking for signs that alien life has come to Earth. We’ve previously seen reports of supposed UFOs submerged in the ocean. This isn’t the first time people have mistaken SpaceX debris for a UFO, either. Back in 2021, a UFO spotting over Washington turned out to just be debris from a SpaceX Starlink launch. Of course, stories like that of the debris and the mysterious flying whirlpool don’t negate some of the more intriguing ones out there. Like, for example, the US Navy confirming that it has spotted unidentifiable objects flying around in Earth’s airspace. Now, were these objects alien in nature? That’s unclear. There’s just not enough information to properly determine that. However, much like the flying whirlpool that was spotted over Hawaii, these objects appear to defy Earth’s laws of flight. As such, many are still scratching their heads about the possibilities of what they could be. Looking for more space news? Check out this 4 billion-year-old comet hurtling into our solar system.

4/23/2022,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene contradicted multiple statements she's made on the 2020 election. Under oath on Friday, she denied wanting Congress to vote against certifying Biden as the 2020 election winner. On multiple previous occasions, Greene said Congress shouldn't have recognized Biden's victory. Despite multiple previous statements to the contrary, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia testified under oath in court on Friday that she didn't actually come out against Congress certifying President Joe Biden as the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. Greene, who has pushed election conspiracy theories and was involved in the QAnon movement before denouncing it, was in court as the result of a civil complaint from registered voters in her district seeking to disqualify her from the ballot in November. One of the notable exchanges from Greene's testimony came when the opposing counsel asked if it was her ""personal opinion"" that Congress should have voted against certifying Biden as the winner. ""No, that's not accurate,"" Greene replied. —Acyn (@Acyn) April 22, 2022 Just two days before the January 6 insurrection, though, Greene promised at a Trump rally that she would refuse to ""certify fraudulent electoral college votes"" for the incoming president. In an earlier video, she also explicitly told her followers that there could not be a peaceful transfer of power because Biden ""did not win this election."" ""You can't allow it to just transfer power 'peacefully' like Joe Biden wants, and allow him to become our president. Because he did not win this election. It's being stolen and the evidence is there,"" Greene said. —Scott Dworkin (@funder) February 4, 2021 Friday's question left Greene some wiggle room by being focused on her personal opinion over a specific date range, but her answer contradicts what she had been saying publicly around the time of the elector certification vote that was interrupted by the deadly Capitol riot.

4/23/2022,"The United States has spent roughly $3.4 billion on sending military assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded on Feb. 24. The latest $800 million package, unveiled in mid-March, includes funds earmarked to gift Kyiv a brand-new line of drones that have never been deployed in combat before. The Phoenix Ghost, an unmanned aerial vehicle, was partly designed with Ukraine in mind, the Pentagon says. “[The drone] was developed for a set of requirements that very closely match what the Ukrainians need right now in Donbas,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters on Thursday, referring to the Eastern region of Ukraine, where Russia has focused its assault. Previously, a different Pentagon official had implied the Phoenix Ghost was created specifically for Ukraine, but Kirby walked back those comments, stating that the drone had been in development long before Russian President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion. “You’re not going to have 120 on your shelves if you just started [building] them on the 24th of February,” Kirby said, noting the U.S. will send 121 units of the drone to Ukraine. The drone has been developed by the California-based AEVEX Aerospace—a secretive company that says it provides “full-spectrum airborne intelligence solutions.” Kirby said he had “no idea” how the drone got its name—which does seem like a misnomer because, unlike a phoenix, the drone will not rise again. The unmanned aerial vehicle is designed to be flown only once. The Phoenix Ghost is similar to “switchblade” drones—also known as “kamikaze drones” or “loitering munitions”—the U.S. has already delivered to Ukraine in that it doesn’t fire on an enemy from a far distance. Instead, such drones hang in the air before crashing into their target and detonating an anti-armor warhead on impact. “[The Phoenix Ghost] like almost all unmanned aerial systems, of course, has optics. So it can also be used to give you a sight picture of what it’s seeing, of course, but its principal focus is attack,” Kirby said, adding that the drone is designed to “deliver a punch.” Drones have proved a pivotal weapon in Ukraine’s resistance against Russian invasion. One Turkish-designed drone, the Bayraktar TB2, has been so successful in launching attacks against Russian tanks and missile bases that when the Armed Forces of Ukraine asked a soldier to write a folk song to rally morale, the soldier rapped about the Turkish drone.

4/23/2022,"Sergey Protosenya was found dead in Spain alongside his wife and daughter on Tuesday, police said. Novatek, his former company, cast doubt on a working police theory that Protosenya killed his family and then himself. Novatek said he was a ""wonderful family man"" and slammed ""speculations"" on his death. The former company of a Russian oligarch found dead in Spain along with his wife and child has cast doubt on a prevailing police theory that the deaths were a murder-suicide. Sergey Protosenya was found hanging in an apartment in Lloret de Mar, a seaside town in Catalonia, Spain, Spanish TV channel Telecinco reported. His wife and daughter were also found dead with stab wounds in the same apartment, the outlet reported. Murder-suicide is the primary working theory of the Mossos D'Esquadra, the Catalan police body investigating the deaths, a spokesperson from Lloret De Mar's town hall told Insider. The Mossos did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. ""Secrecy World"" author Jake Bernstein explains how the super-wealthy hide billions using tax havens and shell companies. In a Thursday statement, Novatek, a major Russian natural gas producer, appeared to suggest that the idea that its former employee could be responsible for the deaths bears ""no relation to reality."" ""Sergey Protosenya ... established himself as an outstanding person and a wonderful family man, a strong professional who made a considerable contribution to the formation and development of the Company,"" it said. ""Unfortunately, speculations have emerged in the media about this topic, but we are convinced that these speculations bear no relation to reality."" Novatek referred Insider to this statement without further comment when asked whether it was referring to the idea that Protosenya could be responsible for the deaths. When approached by Insider with the town hall's confirmation that the police were considering the murder-suicide theory, which would put the matter outside of media speculation, the Novatek spokesperson said this was a question for the Mossos. The Mossos said in a Tuesday statement that it was alerted to the deaths of three people in Lloret De Mar on Tuesday, without naming the victims. A Mossos spokesperson referred to this statement when Insider asked for comment on Protosenya. Though Protosenya's body was found with a bloodied knife and an ax nearby, there were no bloodstains on his person and no suicide note, Spanish outlet El Punta Vui reported, without citing sources. El Punta Vui also reported on Thursday that murder-suicide was the police's primary theory for the deaths. On this basis, the town hall organized a minute's silence on Wednesday in memory of the woman and girl who died, its spokesperson said. Two local equalities ministers, Tània Verge and Irene Montero, also called for unity against gender-based violence, Spanish newspaper La Vangurdia reported. Protosenya served on Novatek's management board between 1997 and 2015, the company said. He was retired at the time of his death, and had amassed a fortune of around $440 million, La Vanguardia reported, citing sources close to the family. Catalan police are currently combing the Protosenya family's phone records and security footage from the home, El Punta Vui reported. The discovery of the Protosenya family's deaths came a day after another Russian oligarch with connections to the energy industry, Vladislav Avayev, was found dead along with his wife and child in his Moscow apartment. Avayev was the former vice president of Gazprombank and was found dead from gunshot wounds, as were his wife and daughter, on Monday, the Russian state-run news agency Tass reported. There is no evidence of a connection between the cases, whose similarities have nonetheless sparked intense international interest.

4/23/2022,"STORY: Drawn by rumors on social media, queues of hopeful men have been forming outside the Russian embassy in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa. Their hope? To enlist to fight for Russia in Ukraine. What began as a trickle of volunteers swelled over two weeks to scores, two neighborhood residents told Reuters. Among them was 40-year-old security guard Biniam Woldetsadik - a retired soldier. ""The reason I want to go to Russia is not to fight Ukraine but because I am not benefiting from my country. I'd rather be a national of a different country."" There is no evidence that any Ethiopians have been sent to Ukraine, nor is it clear if any ever will be. On Tuesday, Reuters reporters saw several hundred men registering with Ethiopian security guards outside the embassy. The guards recorded their names and asked for proof of military service. By Wednesday, the number had dwindled to around 20. The Russian embassy did not respond to questions from Reuters about whether Russia was deploying Ethiopian volunteers to Ukraine. It issued a statement on Tuesday saying that the Ethiopians who showed up outside the embassy were well-wishers expressing ""solidarity and support for the Russian Federation."" The Ethiopian foreign ministry welcomed the Russian statement for what it called ""refuting the unfounded reports of recruitment for the Russian Armed Forces"" but did not respond to Reuters questions. Neither did the Russian foreign ministry. Many parts of Ethiopia are riven by conflict and annual inflation hovers around 30%. Men in the queue said they'd been drawn by rumors of monetary incentives on social media and the possibility of work in Russia after the war. Such as trader Leta Kibru. ""I am willing to leave Ethiopia to support the Russian government in whatever way I can. I want to go and fight along Russians now and in future."" He said he had heard about a $2,000 payout from friends who had registered before him. Two others in the queues this week said they had seen posts on Facebook saying the embassy was signing up recruits. Reuters was not able to find any posts on the subject from official sources or confirm any such offer. Ethiopia has called on all sides in the war to exercise restraint. It did not vote on a U.N. General Assembly resolution condemning the February 24 invasion of Ukraine which Russia calls a ""special operation"".

4/23/2022,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) — The work of an investigator looking into the 2020 presidential election in Wisconsin generated fresh criticism Thursday after newly posted documents included a memo describing one elections worker as “probably” a Democrat in part because she loves nature and “has a weird nose ring.” Also on Thursday, a judge ordered Michael Gableman to stop deleting records, the latest legal defeat for the former state Supreme Court justice. Gableman has released two interim reports on the election won by President Joe Biden and has suggested the GOP-controlled Legislature look into decertifying his victory. Republican leaders including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who hired Gableman, have repeatedly said they have no intention of trying to decertify the win. Gableman's reports have not included evidence to back up the false claims that Donald Trump won Wisconsin in 2020. A recently posted unsigned document on Gableman's website, titled “cross pollinators,” details his probe into public employees who work in elections. That memo contends that a geographic information system analyst for Milwaukee is “probably” a Democrat because she plays video games, “has a weird nose ring,” sometimes colors her hair, “loves nature and snakes” and lives with a boyfriend but is not married to him. Other documents posted on Gableman’s website misspell the name of Vos, who hired him, as “Voss.” The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel first reported on the documents. “It is bizarre,” state Sen. Kathy Bernier, a Republican who leads the Senate Elections Committee, said of the memo. “It is speculative. It is stereotypical. It’s not something I would expect out of a conservative’s position.” Bernier, who has long been critical of Gableman’s investigation, said he is on a “partisan crusade and he’s harming Republicans in the process.” “There’s something wrong with him,” she said. Gableman did not immediately return a message seeking comment. Biden’s win over Trump by nearly 21,000 votes has withstood recounts, independent audits and reviews and numerous lawsuits. Still, Vos ordered the review by Gableman last summer under pressure from Trump and others who falsely contend the election was stolen. Gableman's work is mired in lawsuits, including three brought by the liberal watchdog group American Oversight. It filed numerous open records requests seeking documents primarily from Vos and Gableman. Vos has been found in contempt  in one case for failing to turn over records. Dane County Circuit Judge Frank Remington on Thursday issued an order in another of those lawsuits, telling Gableman “not to delete or destroy any record that is or may be responsive” to the group's open records requests. Remington made the order after Gableman's attorney told American Oversight that it “routinely deletes documents and text messages that are not of use to the investigation.” The nonpartisan Legislative Council, attorneys who advise the Legislature, said in October that deleting such records, even by a state contractor like Gableman, is a violation of Wisconsin law. Gableman's attorney, James Bopp, has argued in court filings that the record retention law does not pertain to contractors. Bopp did not immediately return a message seeking comment Thursday. Bopp said in the April 8 letter to American Oversight that all responsive records have been turned over and once the investigation is complete, all materials will be made public. Bopp said that Gableman's office routinely evaluates documents, including text messages and emails, to determine whether the record is of use to the ongoing probe. Those determined to be relevant are retained and the others are deleted, Bopp said. American Oversight adviser Melanie Sloan faulted Gableman's office for deleting the records. “If this investigation was above board, the Office of Special Counsel would have maintained and released records of its work required by law,"" Sloan said. ""Instead, it is fighting tooth and nail to hide its work from the public. This inquiry is nothing more than an attempt to prop up conspiracy theories and undermine free and fair elections.” Gableman's contract runs through the end of April, but he has indicated in recent interviews that he does not expect it to be extended. Remington in March  released more than 700 pages of documents from Gableman, records the judge said did not support conclusions made in Gableman’s latest report or that showed there has been much of an investigation at all.",U.S./Associated Press,Judge orders Wisconsin investigator to stop deleting records,https://news.yahoo.com/judge-orders-wisconsin-investigator-stop-183717047.html
