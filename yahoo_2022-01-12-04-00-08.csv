1/12/2022,"The Chinese singer Wang Yiren from the K-pop group “Everglow” received backlash from South Korean fans after favoring traditional Chinese etiquette over the Korean New Year’s tradition of bowing to greet fans in Seoul.

The controversial gesture

Wang, the lead dancer and vocalist of the K-pop group, remained standing as she did a Chinese salute making a fist and a palm while her fellow members knelt down in a traditional Korean gesture to greet and express their gratitude to their audience at an event on Jan. 2.

The Chinese state-run Global Times describes the act of kneeling down, which young people have historically used to pay respects towards elder generations, as a “servile” gesture in the modern Chinese culture. In South Korea, however, the gesture is still widely practiced as part of New Year’s celebrations to signify gratitude.

Chinese fan reactions

Many of Wang’s Chinese fans commended her for remaining rooted in her Chinese culture.

“Wang has set a good example for Chinese stars developing their career overseas, which is still keeping with Chinese etiquette and spreading Chinese culture abroad,"" a Sina Weibo user wrote, as translated by the Global Times.

""Wang just went to South Korea for work, not to become a South Korean,” Beijing cultural critic Shi Wenxue also said. “She pursues her career in the country by spending a lot of effort in singing and dancing, which shows her love of K-pop culture. However, this does not mean she has to follow all South Korean culture. 'To seek harmony in diversity' is the principle of our cultural coexistence.""

South Korean fan reactions

However, many South Korean fans criticized the singer online for ignoring the customs of the country. According to the South China Morning Post, many of the comments called on the K-pop star to “Stop making Korean money” and to “Go back to China.”

“All this shows that the Chinese are arrogant and have no respect or consideration for other cultures,” one person wrote on Allkpop.

“I think it's fine if Yiren wants to express her individuality as a Chinese but if she's the only one doing it while everyone else is literally by her feet, it comes off somewhat insensitive to the very country that has welcomed you to promote in,” another person commented. “That’s like the equivalent of an icon walking into a room and everyone getting up to applaud besides you just because you don't care about them.”

Wang’s temporary break

Wang and her management company Yue Hua Entertainment have not commented on the controversial incident; however, the talent agency announced the K-pop star’s temporary break on Monday to visit her family in China.

“Yiren has to go back to China from mid-January till the end of February due to her academic status, so she will be taking a break there for a while to spend time with her family, whom she hasn’t seen in a long time because of Covid-19,” the company stated.

“Everglow will continue their domestic activities with five members, and carry out their schedule as planned,” they added.

1/12/2022,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to hear the appeal of a woman who left home in Alabama to join the Islamic State terror group, but then decided she wanted to return to the United States. The justices declined without comment on Monday to consider the appeal of Hoda Muthana, who was born in New Jersey in October 1994 to a diplomat from Yemen and grew up in Alabama near Birmingham.  Muthana left the U.S. to join the Islamic State in 2014, apparently after becoming radicalized online.  While she was overseas the government determined she was not a U.S. citizen and revoked her passport, citing her father's status as a diplomat at the time of her birth. Her family sued to enable her return to the United States. A federal judge ruled in 2019 that the U.S. government correctly determined Muthana wasn't a U.S. citizen despite her birth in the country. Children of diplomats aren't entitled to birthright citizenship. The family’s lawyers appealed, arguing that her father’s status as a diplomat assigned to the U.N. had ended before her birth, making her automatically a citizen. Muthana surrendered to U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces as Islamic State fighters were losing the last of their self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria and going to refugee camps.  Muthana said she regretted her decision to join the group and wanted to return to the U.S. with her toddler child, the son of a man she met while living with the group. The man later died. Her current whereabouts aren't clear. Family attorney Christina Jump of the Constitutional Law Center for Muslims in America did not immediately return an email seeking comment Tuesday. The decision to revoke her passport was made under former President Barack Obama. The case gained widespread attention as former President Donald Trump tweeted about it, saying he had directed the secretary of state not to allow her back into the country.",U.S./Associated Press,Supreme Court denies appeal of regretful Islamic State bride,https://news.yahoo.com/supreme-court-denies-appeal-regretful-165140676.html
1/12/2022,"A Starbucks store manager who was fired after a barista allegedly spit into the drink of a Park Ridge police officer is suing the coffee chain, saying she was wrongly punished for her handling of the incident. Kelly Hansen-Grosman was store manager at the Park Ridge Starbucks in 2019 when barista Kevin Trejo was transferred to the store and placed under her supervision, according to the lawsuit, filed Jan. 6 in Superior Court in Bergen County. Around July 2, 2020, a supervisor told Hansen-Grosman of a rumor that Trejo had spit into the drink of a law enforcement officer during the shop's “Grab and Go” drink service, and Hansen-Grosman immediately began an investigation, she says in her complaint. She interviewed ''each employee of Starbucks’ Park Ridge Store, all of whom denied having any knowledge about Trejo spitting into a law enforcement officer’s drink,'' according to the complaint. Trejo, of Westwood, was ultimately arrested by Park Ridge police on July 20, 2020, and charged with assaulting a law enforcement officer. Trejo was ""no longer an employee"" as of July 21, 2020, Starbucks told NorthJersey.com But before the arrest, Hansen-Grosman says she felt ""uncomfortable"" firing Trejo because there was an open investigation into an earlier claim by Trejo that he had been the target of discrimination by another Starbucks employee. Hansen-Grossman says in her complaint that when she was made aware of the police investigation, she pledged her full cooperation. A Starbucks director who said he was concerned that workers might have been dishonest when investigated internally told Hansen-Grosman to fire Trejo and meet with the Park Ridge Police Department, according to the complaint. After her meeting with police, Hansen-Grosman alleges, she endured retaliation for whistleblowing and discrimination on the basis of her attention deficit disorder, and, she says, Michael Scott, her regional director, accused her of being incapable of managing the Park Ridge store. State news: NJ school mask mandate will continue for 'foreseeable future,' Gov. Phil Murphy says According to her complaint, Scott asked to see text messages on Hansen-Grosman's personal cellphone regarding the time of the meeting with the Park Ridge Police Department and police union representatives, but then grabbed the phone out of her hand and proceeded to scroll through her text messages. “I was made to feel like I did something wrong with how I reached out to the Police Department, but I was given no direction or guidelines from anyone about how to connect,"" Hansen-Grosman alleges. She was fired in January 2021. Hansen-Grosman says she began at Starbucks in 2000 as a barista in California and rose through the ranks. In her suit she describes a stellar career, with accolades for customer service, including an award from Starbucks in 2017 and recognition from Rep. Josh Gottheimer for Outstanding Customer Service to the Community. Jay Go Guasch, a Starbucks representative, said, “We care deeply about the experience every partner has while wearing the green apron, but with respect to our partners we are unable to comment further on private employment matters and pending litigation.” Hansen-Grosman is seeking monetary compensation including back pay. She also wants Starbucks District Manager Matthew Phillips and Regional Director Michael Scott, who are named in the suit, to participate in additional harassment training and anti-discrimination training. The criminal complaint against Trejo has not gone to trial. He faces charges of assaulting a law enforcement officer, tampering and creating a hazardous condition. Starbucks operates more than 32,000 coffee stores, including about 18,354 in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Shaylah Brown is a local reporter for NorthJersey.com.
