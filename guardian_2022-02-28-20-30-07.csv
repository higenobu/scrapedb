2/28/2022,"Facebook and Instagram have taken down a disinformation network targeting people in Ukraine, as their owner announced it was blocking access to Kremlin-backed media organisations in the country. Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta said it had uncovered a “relatively small” network of about 40 accounts, pages and groups on the two social media platforms. The network ran websites posing as independent news entities and created fake personas across social media including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Telegram as well as Odnoklassniki and VK in Russia, Meta added. In a blogpost, Nathaniel Gleicher and David Agranovich, Meta’s head of security policy and director of threat disruption respectively, said the networks were run from Russia and Ukraine. “They were operated from Russia and Ukraine and targeted people in Ukraine across multiple social media platforms and through their own websites. We took down this operation, blocked their domains from being shared on our platform, and shared information with other tech platforms, researchers and governments.” The post added that the network had a small presence, with 4,000 Facebook accounts following one of more of its pages and fewer than 500 accounts following one or more of its Instagram accounts. Fake personas created by the network included Kyiv-based professionals purporting to be news editors, a former aviation engineer and a hydrography expert. The network operated a handful of sites purporting to be independent news organisations, which claimed the west was betraying Ukraine and that Ukraine was a failed state. Meta said the network had links to another network it disabled in April 2020 that was connected to connected to individuals in Russia, the Donbas region in Ukraine and two media organisations in Crimea that have since been sanctioned by the US government. The post also detailed the use of a Russia and Belarus-linked hacking campaign known as Ghostwriter, in which social media accounts are hacked and used to spread disinformation. Meta said Ukrainian military and public figures had been targeted and there had been attempts to make their Facebook accounts host YouTube videos claiming to show Ukrainian soldiers surrendering. “We’ve taken steps to secure accounts that we believe were targeted by this threat actor and, when we can, to alert the users that they had been targeted,” wrote Gleicher and Agranovich. Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said the company had blocked several accounts in Ukraine including those of some Russian state media organisations. We have been in contact with the Government of Ukraine, and at their request we have also restricted access to several accounts in Ukraine, including those belonging to some Russian state media organizations. Clegg added that the company was reviewing “other” government requests to block Russian state media on its platforms. Meta’s move came as Lithuania issued a statement with Poland and other Baltic states asking Twitter, Facebook, Google and YouTube to suspend the accounts of the Russian and Belarus political leadership as well as government institutions and state-owned media in those countries. Netblocks, which tracks internet traffic shutdowns, said access to Twitter and Facebook was being restricted across Russia. On Friday, Russia’s state communications watchdog announced it was imposing “partial” restrictions on accessing Facebook as it accused the platform of censoring state media content. “The Twitter and Facebook restrictions in Russia are significant, impacting major internet providers and effectively slowing down the platforms to the point that content doesn’t load and the services are difficult or impossible to use,” said Netblocks. Clegg said on Twitter on Sunday that the Russian government was “throttling our platform” but the company would not restrict access to Facebook and Instagram in Russia. “We believe turning off our services would silence important expression at a crucial time,” Clegg wrote.",News/Technology,Facebook takes down disinformation network targeting Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/feb/28/facebook-takes-down-disinformation-network-targeting-ukraine-meta-instagram
2/28/2022,"Countries around the world have imposed an unprecedented array of economic and other sanctions on Russia after Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, targeting its finance, energy and military-industrial sectors as well as individuals and sporting events. Here are some of the measures adopted by the US, EU and UK, with countries including Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand all taking similar steps: The EU, US, UK and Canada have agreed to “prevent the Russian central bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions”. The EU has since said it is banning all transactions with the institution, which has €640bn in reserves, in an effort to “paralyse its assets”. The Russian state has been in effect banned from raising sovereign debt in the UK and elsewhere and shares of Russian state-owned entities may no longer be listed on EU stock exchanges. A range of Russian banks – their names have not yet been announced – are also being cut out of the Swift international payments system by the EU, US, UK and Canada. Brussels has said this will “stop them from operating worldwide, and effectively block Russian exports and imports”. The US has placed Russia’s top 10 financial institutions, representing about 80% of the country’s banking sector, under restrictions, including cutting off the biggest – Sberbank, which accounts for about 30% of Russian banking – and its subsidiaries from conducting transactions through the US system. The assets of many other Russian banks, including VTB, the country’s second largest, Bank Rossiya and Promsvyazbank, have also been hit with strict asset freezes and/or new business restrictions in the EU, UK, US and elsewhere. The foreign assets of the Russian president, his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, have been frozen in the EU, US and UK, as have those of the FSB security head, Alexander Bortnikov, the armed forces chief, Valery Gerasimov, and members of the Kremlin’s security council. The EU has imposed sanctions on all 351 members of Russia’s parliament, the Duma; the US and UK are punishing selected members as are Australia, Japan and New Zealand. More than a dozen billionaire oligarchs with ties to Putin’s regime, including Andrey Patrushev (oil company Rosneft), Petr Fradkov (Promsvyazbank), Yury Slyusar (United Aircraft), Boris Rotenberg (gas pipeline company SMP), Denis Bortnikov (VTB bank) and Kirill Shamalov, ex-husband of Putin’s daughter Katarina, are on asset freeze and travel ban lists around the world. The US is also sanctioning top state-owned bank executives from VTB and Sberbank. Canada and Australia have also imposed sanctions on multiple oligarchs. The UK has imposed a £50,000 limit on bank accounts held by Russian nationals in the UK), and the EU a limit of €100,000 in EU banks. Russian airlines and private jets have been progressively banned from UK and EU airspace and the US is considering similar action but has yet to make a final decision. Aeroflot has said it will cancel all flights to European destinations; multiple European airlines have said they are halting routes to Russia. The US has in effect banned the Russian energy company Gazprom, the oil pipeline company Transneft, and the power company RusHydro, as well as the country’s biggest freight, rail and telecoms companies, from its credit markets. The EU has introduced a ban on exports of aircraft and aviation parts to Russia, as well as exports of hi-tech goods including semiconductors, computers, telecoms and information security equipment and sensors. UK and EU-based companies are also banned from exporting to a wide range of Russian defence, naval, transport and communications companies, including the infamous Internet Research Agency troll farm in St Petersburg. The Uefa Champions League final has been removed from St Petersburg to Paris. Fifa has said Russia’s World Cup playoff against Poland next month must be played at a neutral venue with no spectators, flags or national anthem, and Russia must play as “Football Union of Russia (RFU)”. Poland and other countries have already said they will not play Russia and further Fifa sanctions seem likely. The Formula One grand prix and all World Cup skiing events in Russia have been cancelled.

2/28/2022,"The owner of the fast fashion brand Primark said that group profits will bounce back above pre-Covid levels in its first half, but sales at its UK retail chain still remain 9% below 2019 levels. Associated British Foods, which also owns brands including Twinings and Ovaltine as well as a sugar business, said that it expects total sales and operating profits to be strongly ahead of the equivalent period in 2021. Primark sales for the first half are expected to be more than 60% ahead of last year. The company said that the impact of the surging costs of raw materials, and supply chain problems, at its Primark operation have been mostly balanced by cutting store operating costs and a favourable exchange rate with the US dollar. In January, the fast fashion retailer announced that it is cutting 400 management-level jobs at its retail stores. ABF said that it is attempting to offset the rising cost of raw materials, commodities, energy and in the supply chain across its three food businesses through cost savings and price increases. “Actions on price inevitably lag input cost inflation,” the company said. “As a result, we expect some margin reduction in these three businesses at the half year but expect our plans to deliver a recovery in the run-rate of these margins by the financial year end.” ABF said its net cash position had increased to £1.5bn from £705m the previous year, when store closures cost it more than £600m. There was an extra boost from the sale of autumn and winter inventory brought forward from the previous year. “All of our stores are trading and remained open throughout the half year, except for short periods of store closures in Austria and the Netherlands,” said the company, which operates a network of almost 600 shops, including 191 in the UK. “The pressure of disruption to the supply chain experienced in the autumn has continued to alleviate despite some delays in dispatch and slightly longer lead times.” The company said that its colourful spring/summer collections have met a “positive initial reaction” from shoppers, with luggage and swimwear selling well in recent weeks as the public gears up for a summer holiday boom. “Despite another bump in the road in the lead-up to Christmas arising from the Omicron variant, for the most part the store estate was open during the period and the trading update mirrors what has previously been seen when the shackles are removed at Primark,” said Richard Hunter, the head of markets at Interactive Investor. “Primark’s return to form is a welcome development for the group, particularly since in better times it accounts for around half of group revenues.” However, the company warned that continued inflationary pressure may affect profits. “With our stock purchases largely committed for the second half of the financial year, we expect some reduction in the operating profit margin from that achieved in the first half reflecting further inflationary pressures,” it said.

2/28/2022,"Good morning. The rouble crashed more than 40% after trading began today amid unprecedented international sanctions against Russia’s financial system over Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s central bank more than doubled interest rates to 20%, and banned foreigners from selling local securities, in an effort to protect its currency and economy. The news came as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, told the British prime minister that the next 24 hours would be “crucial” for his country and amid reports that a column of Russian tanks was heading for the capital. Meanwhile, a US official believes Belarus is preparing to send soldiers into Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion. The Washington Post spoke to an unnamed US administration official on Sunday evening who said the deployment could begin as soon as today. Is the US doing anything more to help? Yes. The US stepped up the flow of weapons to Ukraine, announcing on Sunday it would send Stinger missiles as part of a package approved by the White House. What about the UN? A rare emergency special session of the UN general assembly is due to be held today in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, marking the first time in 40 years the security council has made such a request. Is there any chance of a ceasefire? Ukraine has agreed to send a delegation to meet Russian representatives on the border with Belarus, which would be the two sides’ first public contact since war erupted. Zelenskiy said he was not confident that any progress would be made, but that he would try. The supreme court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson should be placed “beyond politics”, the politician who extracted Joe Biden’s politically priceless promise to instal the first Black woman on the court said on Sunday. Some Republicans have complained that nominations should not be made on grounds of race or gender – ignoring promises to put women on the court acted on by Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump. James Clyburn, the South Carolina congressman and House Democratic whip whose endorsement propelled Biden to the presidential nomination and produced his promise to pick a Black woman, appeared yesterday on CBS’s Face the Nation. He said he hoped “that all my Republican friends will look upon” the nomination of Jackson as being “beyond politics”. Why would it be such a big deal with Jackson gets approved? Of 115 supreme court justices, 108 have been white men. Two have been Black men, five women. But is she qualified? She definitely seems to be. In fact, Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas, has pointed out that Jackson has more trial experience than four current justices combined – including the chief, John Roberts. In a new memoir, the former US attorney general William Barr says Donald Trump must not be the Republican candidate for president in 2024. The man he served between 2019 and 2020, Barr writes, has “shown he has neither the temperament nor persuasive powers to provide the kind of positive leadership that is needed”. Trump, Barr says, has surrounded himself with “sycophants” and “whack jobs from outside the government, who fed him a steady diet of comforting but unsupported conspiracy theories”. Trump hinted again on Saturday that he intends to run in 2024. He did not immediately comment on Barr’s analysis. When will Barr’s book be out? His book, One Damn Thing After Another: Memoirs of an Attorney General, will be published on 8 March, its title taken from a description of the job by Ed Levi, appointed by Gerald Ford after the Watergate scandal. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar, members of Congress who spoke at a white nationalist event in Florida this week, are “morons” with no place in the Republican party, Mitt Romney said on Sunday. “I have to think anybody that would sit down with white nationalists and speak at their conference was certainly missing a few IQ points,” he said. The Russian star conductor Valery Gergiev has been dropped by his management over his close ties to Vladimir Putin as he faces a looming deadline to publicly denounce the Russian president or lose yet another role in his rapidly crumbling career, with Munich Philharmonic poised to fire him next. At least 368,000 people have already fled their homes in Ukraine, according to the UN refugee agency, and more than 4.5 million more could follow if the fighting spreads, Ukrainian authorities have said, with reports of tens of thousands on the move within the country itself. The number of new people getting vaccinated in America has steadily declined in recent months, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data. But doctors emphasize that the virus remains a threat in the US and that people who are not vaccinated are at greater risk of become severely ill or dying. Two days before his first State of the Union address, with war raging in Ukraine and inflation rising at home, Joe Biden’s approval rating hit a new low in a major US poll. The survey from the Washington Post and ABC News put Biden’s approval rating at 37%. The fivethirtyeight.com poll average pegs his approval rating at 40.8% overall. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, told ABC’s This Week that Biden would acknowledge challenges but also project optimism when he speaks to Congress and the nation at the Capitol on Tuesday night. It is 10 years since she helped launch possibly the biggest global protest movement in history. But then came controversy as huge sums of money flowed in. Patrisse Cullors describes how her childhood inspired her activism – and the hurt she has suffered. “I was thrust into a global spotlight, but at the end of the day I’m a local community organiser. I can sustain local organising work. I think being the face of a global movement was turning me into something I didn’t want to be. I didn’t want to be a shark. I don’t have the emotional bandwidth,” she tells Nesrine Malik. The impacts of the climate crisis are proving much worse than predicted, and governments must act more urgently to adapt to them or face global disaster, the UK president of the UN climate talks has warned on the eve of a landmark new scientific assessment of the climate. Alok Sharma, who led the Cop26 climate summit last year, said: “The changes in the climate we are seeing today are affecting us much sooner and are greater than we originally thought. The impacts on our daily lives will be increasingly severe and stark.” All eight Slovenian MEPs have weighed in to a ding-dong in a small town in northern Italy, calling on the European Commission to act to “protect traditions” after an Italian judge silenced a church’s bells. For some in Dolina, a town with a minority Slovene community close to Italy’s border with Slovenia, the bells of Sant’Ulderico church were essential to the rhythm of their day. For others, the “loud and excessive” ringing was a bane, leading to a petition that in turn led a judge in nearby Trieste to remove the bells in an unprecedented ruling.

2/28/2022,"Granting a petition by several states and coal companies, the supreme court on 28 February will address what appears to be a technical legal question: does the Environmental Protection Agency have authority to calculate Co2 emissions targets for power plants based on mitigation techniques involving steps “beyond the fence-line” of individual plants? In truth, the matter the court is considering implicates –and imperils – the federal government’s power to fashion flexible solutions not only to global heating but to all manner of complex problems. The stakes are higher still: by ruling on the case at all, the court usurps power constitutionally entrusted to government’s politically accountable branches. Article 3 of the constitution limits federal courts to deciding concrete “cases and controversies” about the rights of individual parties. Yet this “case” involves neither a concrete dispute nor the specific rights of any of the challengers. Instead, it’s akin to an exam question about the options theoretically available to a federal agency to address a grave problem. In answering that hypothetical question, the court will have arrogated to itself an unprecedented, open-ended power to reshape the nation’s social and economic landscape – far in excess of its legitimate authority, as the foundational case Marbury v. Madison put it, to “declare what the law is”. The court has avoided such a wide-ranging role ever since our founding, when Chief Justice Jay refused President George Washington’s 1793 request for legal advice about America’s obligations under treaties with France and Britain, concluding that issuing such an “advisory opinion” to guide the nation’s foreign policy would exceed the court’s constitutionally assigned power. The underlying axiom is neither liberal nor conservative but universal. As Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the court just last term, “federal courts decide only ‘the rights of individuals’ [and] do not possess a roving commission to publicly opine on every legal question.” The role the court is poised to play in West Virginia v. EPA is more breathtaking still. It stands ready not just to “publicly opine” on a broad legal question but to bind the entire federal government to its answer, restricting the range of policies the EPA –under President Joe Biden and future presidents – can even consider to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and tackle climate change. Issuing any such “super advisory opinion” would seize the power to set regulatory policy itself – a perversion of separation of powers unthinkable just a few years ago. Yet, as its recent onrush of breaks with precedent, procedure and prudence to achieve the ultra-conservative majority’s policy preferences on abortion, public health and voting rights demonstrate, today’s court flouts all institutional bounds. As it charges ahead, what remains of the court’s legitimacy, the constitution’s allocation of decision-making authority, and the planet’s future all hang in the balance. How did we get here? In 1970, Congress passed the Clean Air Act, empowering the new EPA to regulate dangerous pollutants like carbon dioxide to make our air safer; indeed, after the supreme court’s 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, the act requires EPA to seek lower Co2 emissions. One section tasks EPA with identifying the “best system of emissions reduction” that’s feasible to reduce Co2 from existing power plants, the largest category of stationary emitters. In 2015, to meet American commitments under the Paris Climate Accords, President Barack Obama’s EPA promulgated the Clean Power Plan – an ambitious plan to shrink power sector emissions by more than 30%. It hinged on a central notion: the CAA’s “best system” language didn’t contemplate only reductions individual plants could achieve by themselves, but authorized EPA to consider reductions the entire electrical grid might achieve by working as an integrated whole. Thus, EPA could design, as its “best system”, a scheme in which power companies reduced emissions by substituting cleaner energy like renewables and natural gas for dirtier coal – a tactic known as “generation shifting”. The plan was challenged on numerous legal grounds. Some insisted EPA could not so broadly construe the statutory word “system”, a claim difficult to square with the foundational doctrine of “Chevron deference,” under which courts defer to any “reasonable” agency interpretation of an “ambiguous” term like “system”. The senior author of this column challenged EPA’s plan on the narrower basis that EPA had rested its legislative authority on nonexistent power to choose which of two versions of the CAA Congress had enacted. In any event, the supreme court stayed the plan’s implementation in 2016 while the DC circuit sorted out its legality. When Donald Trump was elected president months later, he sought to repeal the CPP. His EPA could have done so by just changing its preferred policy or legal interpretation, as supreme court doctrine readily permits agencies to do. But the Trump administration wanted more: to permanently foreclose any remotely similar plan. So it based its repeal on the mind-boggling theory that CAA’s text unambiguously barred not only CPP, but any system of emissions reduction that couldn’t be entirely effectuated within the “fence-lines” of stand-alone power plants. That interpretation barred not only generation shifting, but also far less controversial techniques like biomass co-firing (mixing biological material into portions of what coal plants burn for energy). This extreme reading was belied both by the basic functioning of our integrated, unitary power grid, and by previous EPA and supreme court interpretations of all relevant language. If the increasingly reactionary federal judiciary upheld that strained construction as mandatory, it would be locked in until Congress enacted a new regulatory framework. Realistically, that might mean forever. Buttressing its twisted textual reading, Trump’s EPA invoked the “major questions doctrine” – an altogether amorphous weapon the court recently invented to strike the Center for Disease Control’s eviction moratorium and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s workplace vaccine-or-test mandate. Its premise is radical: wherever a court deems an agency’s policy choice to have resolved a “major question”, it must nullify that choice unless Congress, in enacting the relevant statute, anticipated the precise question and unmistakably authorized the agency’s precise answer. That doctrine licenses judges to strike down whatever policy they disfavor – and invites agencies to opportunistically disclaim any regulatory authority they’d prefer not to exercise. It’s also inconsistent with the fact that contemporary social problems are too complex and interwoven with changing circumstances for Congress to predict every policy answer with technical precision, requiring that it legislate in broad terms and task expert agencies with filling in the details. Routinely applying the “major questions doctrine” might thus nihalistically nuke federal power to solve nearly any important problem. Trump’s EPA did just that in repealing CPP, proclaiming itself categorically powerless to consider any “beyond the fence-line” emissions reduction systems because CAA either unambiguously precluded such consideration or failed unambiguously to empower such consideration, as the “major question” doctrine supposedly demanded. Dozens of environmental groups and blue states challenged the repeal in court, and a day before Biden assumed office, the DC circuit held Trump’s interpretation not the only permissible reading of the text and struck down the repeal as legally flawed. Although CPP might have “snapped back” into force, the DC circuit stayed its judgment until Biden’s EPA could formulate a new rule. Given intervening legal developments – and years of rapid change in the power sector that achieved CPP’s emissions targets through free-market behavior – the agency had prudently asked for time to promulgate an entirely new rule. This was a big win for the coal companies and CPP’s red-state opponents; with both the rule and its replacement stayed, no applicable regulation exists. None. When Biden’s EPA suggests a new rule, it will be immediately reviewable in federal court. Until then, CPP’s opponents have their wish: less federal Co2 regulation – in fact, none at all. In every sense, the dispute has become moot until EPA proposes a new rule imposing actual obligations on the states and companies. Unsatisfied with that temporary victory, the states and coal companies filed several petitions asking the supreme court to hear the case and permanently lock in Trump’s defenestration of EPA’s authority – lest they be injured by what Biden’s EPA might someday propose if the court doesn’t proactively clip the agency’s wings. Given that no regulations currently apply, no clever framing can disguise the obvious: they’re asking the court for a “super advisory opinion”, prematurely answering an abstract question to preemptively bind an ideologically opposite administration before it has a chance to govern. Equally worrying, several of the briefs urge the court to adopt extraordinarily broad understandings of when and how the “major questions” doctrine applies; to entirely overturn Chevron, one of the court’s most deeply entrenched precedents; and to gut nearly the entire CAA by reviving the long-dormant “non-delegation doctrine” – last employed by the ultra-conservative Lochner-era court to frustrate the New Deal in the 1930s. A super advisory opinion in this case has the potential not only to gut EPA’s power to regulate pollution and climate, but also to severely blunt the regulatory authority of nearly the entire federal government. As one of us has written elsewhere, “law’s constraints are no match for power’s voracious appetite.” To an unaccountable tribunal of life-tenured, ideologically inclined justices, no doctrine presents an enforceable barrier to impulses of the most blatantly partisan variety. But hope is not yet lost. As the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia often emphasized, the ourt retains a “special obligation” to re-evaluate its own authority and to dismiss cases whenever jurisdictional defects are discovered. To hear this case, four justices sufficed; perhaps five others will recognize what centuries of precedent make clear: the court should dismiss the case and wait until an actual EPA regulation creates a concrete, live dispute. We can still urge and cautiously hope for that prudent approach; all the justices “are, in the end, masters of their craft and know that their power requires them to act as lawyers”.

2/28/2022,"As a statement of continuing intent, it speaks volumes for Uproar – Wales’s new music ensemble launched in 2018 by conductor Michael Rafferty – that in the group’s current tour, he is taking them into repertory championed by elite groups such as France’s Ensemble Intercontemporain and USA’s International Contemporary Ensemble (ICE). Chinese, New York-based Du Yun was a co-founder of ICE. Her musical imagination crisscrosses the boundaries of cultural expression, and Uproar’s performance of her piece Impeccable Quake, with its shades of jazz and the wah-wah of electric guitar, reflected well Du Yun’s irrepressible vibrancy. Uproar’s current tour takes its title, Scenes from the Street, from the theme of Unsuk Chin’s Gougalon, prompted by memories of street theatre in her native South Korea. In the Dora Stoutzker Hall’s fine acoustic, Chin’s brilliant instrumental textures with the infinite variety of percussion instruments emerged with such clarity as to dazzle the ear. A special shout here for percussionists Julian Warburton and James Harrison, meticulous throughout, who got their limelight moment in Episode Between Bottles and Cans, their mallets hitting the colourful array of actual bottles and cans of varying pitches. But a large part of Uproar’s raison d’être is commissioning work from composers who are Welsh or working in Wales. There were three such new pieces here, already premiered in Bangor’s New Music festival, and using roughly the same personnel as the Chin and Du Yun: 17 to 19 instruments. Joseph Davies’s Collider references both the Cern Hadron particle accelerator and the absence of the everyday collisions of busy people going about their lives. Strings lamented for the latter, but it was the motoric drive, with its striking bustle and rhythmic pulsing which carried the piece to its upbeat conclusion. Carlijn Metselaar’s Forest Bathing was a gentle foil to this, inspired by the Japanese practice of shinrin yoku, finding wellbeing by being among trees. Quietly unhurried and atmospheric, the piece’s use of low instruments – cello, bass clarinet, contrabassoon and double-bass – to carry the darkly meandering melodic lines added a strong feeling of groundedness. Guto Pryderi Puw’s apparently lighthearted Popping Candy disguised a serious engagement with qualities of sound. Exploring the pops and fizz that ensue when the carbonated candy of the title (also known as Space Dust or Pop Rocks) collides with moisture in the mouth, the piece toyed enticingly with brittle cracks and skittering phrases. In its final phase, players used the sweet packets as micro maracas, then tossed the contents into their mouths to create almost imperceptible tiny explosions, while changing their pitches by moving and contorting their facial muscles.

2/28/2022,"Catastrophic flooding on the scale of the disaster hitting Queensland and New South Wales is becoming more likely as the planet heats due to greenhouse gas emissions, climate scientists have warned. The latest major assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) found global warming caused by humans was causing dangerous and widespread disruption, with many effects expected to be more severe than predicted. In Australia, it said extreme events exacerbated by emissions – heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and fires – were causing death, injury and financial and emotional stress. Their impacts were “cascading and compounding” across nature, society and the economy. There was “very high confidence” that some natural systems had already experienced irreversible change. Examples included extensive coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef, the loss of giant kelp forests in the country’s south-east and the extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys, a mammal that lost its habitat to sea level rise and storm surges. Prof Mark Howden, ​​vice-chair of the IPCC working group behind the report and director of the ANU Institute for Climate, Energy and Disaster Solutions, said the evidence showed “climate change impacts are here, they matter, they are mostly negative but, if implemented, adaptation can take the edge off them”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “The latest IPCC report makes one thing crystal clear – adaptation policy, finance and practice have to be stepped up urgently if our systems are to keep pace with climate change,” he said. “Simply put, adaptation is key to maintaining our health, our industries and our environment.” On the floods that have killed eight people and caused extraordinary property damage in south-east Queensland and northern New South Wales, Howden said it was not possible to say a particular extreme event was caused by rising emissions without an attribution study. However, he said the climate crisis was “embedded in this event” as inflated ocean and atmospheric temperatures increased the intensity of major storms. “It’s more likely you’re going to see this in the future with climate change because of the warmer atmosphere, and the ability to hold more moisture in the warmer atmosphere,” he said. It would lead to “heavier rainfall when it falls”. “The frequency may not change, but the strength of [storms] will change and that will increase the variability of climate in Australia, particularly in the north-east and down through the south-east,” he said. Prof Brendan Mackey, the coordinating lead author of an Australia-New Zealand chapter in the report and director of the Griffith University Climate Action Beacon, agreed. “One of the clear projections is an increase in the intensity of heavy rainfall events,” he said. Mackey said the report identified nine major climate risks facing Oceania: The loss and degradation of coral reefs and the biodiversity that relied on them due to ocean warming and heatwaves. Loss of alpine biodiversity due a reduction in snow. Collapse of southern Australian forests due to hotter and drier conditions and an increased number of fires. Loss of kelp forests due to warming, heatwaves and overgrazing by fish and urchins that move south as the ocean warms. Loss of low-lying coastal areas due to sea level rise. Disruption in agricultural production and increased stress in rural communities in the south-west, south and east of the country as it becomes hotter and drier. Rise in people and wildlife dying and becoming ill due to heatwaves. Cascading and compounding impacts on cities and towns, infrastructure and supply chains due to bushfires, floods, droughts, heatwaves, storms and sea level rise. Inability of institutions and government systems to manage climate risks. The report released on Monday is the second part of the IPCC’s latest major assessment, drawing on thousands of peer-reviewed scientific papers. The first part examined the physical science of climate change. The second part focused on the impacts of the crisis and the ability to adapt to inevitable change. It found there were options to limit the impacts if there was proper planning, but progress on adaptation was uneven due to problems including a lack of consistent policy direction, fear of litigation and concern about upfront costs. Prof Kathryn Bowen, from the University of Melbourne’s Melbourne Climate Futures and a lead author on the report, said it underlined the importance of considering the “intricate and fundamental links between humans, ecosystems and society”. She highlighted the IPCC’s new focus on cascading and compounding effects – for example, the severe drought of last decade, which was followed by the black summer bushfires, which was followed in some parts of the country by floods. “The impacts of these climate hazards affect our ability to recover, as often there is little time between their onset,” she said. She said rapid transformations were needed to ensure that Australian society developed “in a way that is climate resilient and sustainable”. It said it included ensuring there was universal access to primary healthcare, including mental health care. “Many risks for human health and wellbeing could be reduced, and some potentially avoided, if we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen our adaptation responses,” she said.

2/28/2022,"Climate breakdown is accelerating rapidly, many of the impacts will be more severe than predicted and there is only a narrow chance left of avoiding its worst ravages, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said. Even at current levels, human actions in heating the climate are causing dangerous and widespread disruption, threatening devastation to swathes of the natural world and rendering many areas unliveable, according to the landmark report published on Monday. “The scientific evidence is unequivocal: climate change is a threat to human wellbeing and the health of the planet,” said Hans-Otto Pörtner, a co-chair of working group 2 of the IPCC. “Any further delay in concerted global action will miss a brief and rapidly closing window to secure a liveable future.” In what some scientists termed “the bleakest warning yet”, the summary report from the global authority on climate science says droughts, floods, heatwaves and other extreme weather are accelerating and wreaking increasing damage. Allowing global temperatures to increase by more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as looks likely on current trends in greenhouse gas emissions, would result in some “irreversible” impacts. These include the melting of ice caps and glaciers, and a cascading effect whereby wildfires, the die-off of trees, the drying of peatlands and the thawing of permafrost release additional carbon emissions, amplifying the warming further. António Guterres, the UN secretary general, said: “I have seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like this. Today’s IPCC report is an atlas of human suffering and a damning indictment of failed climate leadership.” John Kerry, the US special presidential envoy for climate, said the report “paints a dire picture of the impacts already occurring because of a warmer world and the terrible risks to our planet if we continue to ignore science. We have seen the increase in climate-fuelled extreme events, and the damage that is left behind – lives lost and livelihoods ruined. The question at this point is not whether we can altogether avoid the crisis – it is whether we can avoid the worst consequences.” The report says: Everywhere is affected, with no inhabited region escaping dire impacts from rising temperatures and increasingly extreme weather. About half the global population – between 3.3 billion and 3.6 billion people – live in areas “highly vulnerable” to climate change. Millions of people face food and water shortages owing to climate change, even at current levels of heating. Mass die-offs of species, from trees to corals, are already under way. 1.5C above pre-industrial levels constitutes a “critical level” beyond which the impacts of the climate crisis accelerate strongly and some become irreversible. Coastal areas around the globe, and small, low-lying islands, face inundation at temperature rises of more than 1.5C. Key ecosystems are losing their ability to absorb carbon dioxide, turning them from carbon sinks to carbon sources. Some countries have agreed to conserve 30% of the Earth’s land, but conserving half may be necessary to restore the ability of natural ecosystems to cope with the damage wreaked on them. This is the second part of the IPCC’s latest assessment report, an updated, comprehensive review of global knowledge of the climate, which has been seven years in the making and draws on the peer-reviewed work of thousands of scientists. The assessment report is the sixth since the IPCC was first convened by the UN in 1988, and may be the last to be published while there is still some chance of avoiding the worst. A first instalment, by the IPCC’s working group 1, published last August, on the physical science of climate change, said the climate crisis was “unequivocally” caused by human actions, resulting in changes that were “unprecedented”, with some becoming “irreversible”. This second part, by working group 2, deals with the impacts of climate breakdown, sets out areas where the world is most vulnerable, and details how we can try to adapt and protect against some of the impacts. A third section, due in April, will cover ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and the final part, in October, will summarise these lessons for governments meeting in Egypt for the UN Cop27 climate summit. Small islands will be among those worst affected. Walton Webson, an ambassador of Antigua and Barbuda and the chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, called the findings “cataclysmic”. He urged the UN to convene a special session to consider action. “We are continuing to head for a precipice – we say our eyes are open to the risks, but when you look at global emissions, if anything we are accelerating towards the cliff edge. We are not seeing the action from the big emitters that is required to get emissions down in this critical decade – this means halving emissions by 2030 at the latest. It is clear that time is slipping away from us.” Governments in other parts of the world could help their people to adapt to some of the impacts of the climate crisis, the report says, by building flood defences, helping farmers to grow different crops, or building more resilient infrastructure. But the authors say the capacity of the world to adapt to the impacts will diminish rapidly the further temperatures rise, quickly reaching “hard” limits beyond which adaptation would be impossible. The climate crisis also has the power to worsen problems such as hunger, ill-health and poverty, the report makes clear. Dave Reay, the director of Edinburgh Climate Change Institute at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Like taking a wrecking ball to a set of global dominoes, climate change in the 21st century threatens to destroy the foundations of food and water security, smash onwards through the fragile structures of human and ecosystem health, and ultimately shake the very pillars of human civilisation.” The report plays down fears of conflicts arising from the climate crisis, finding that “displacement” and “involuntary migration” of people would ensue but that “non-climatic factors are the dominant drivers of existing intrastate violent conflicts”. But Jeffrey Kargel, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in the US, said: “The current warfare activity in eastern Europe, though not attributable to climate change, is a further caution about how human tensions and international relations and geopolitics could become inflamed as climate change impacts hit nations in ways that they are ill-prepared to handle.”",News/Environment,IPCC issues ‘bleakest warning yet’ on impacts of climate breakdown,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/feb/28/ipcc-issues-bleakest-warning-yet-impacts-climate-breakdown
2/28/2022,"“I didn’t know which type you wanted, so I bought both,” is a wonderful sentence. Vincenzo put two neat, white packets on the counter, along with the bread, crackers and strawberry yoghurt. I love opening cheese – especially blue cheese, the bellowing scent rushing up your nose, fantastic and intrusive. The gorgonzola dolce had stuck to the paper, so it needed to be tasted. The gorgonzola piccante was a celebration of ageing and veins. The dog went nuts. To make gorgonzola, full fat, pasteurized cow’s milk is heated with rennet. Gorgonzola also requires the addition of lactic ferments, yeast and most importantly, penicillium roqueforti – microscopic mould spores. The heat causes coagulation and the milk separates into whey (which drains away) and curds, which are cut and pressed into cylinders. Then comes la prima salatura – the first salting – when the forms are immersed in large vats of warm brine for 24 hours. Then there is another pause before the second salting, the length of which depends on the type of gorgonzola being made. Next comes the ageing room and steel needles. By injecting the cheese with the latter, oxygen is introduced and meets the mould spores. This causes what’s known as the nascita dell’erborinatura – the birth of marbling, natural growth of mould in the form of veins, with their unmistakable and volatile, fruit-metal-ammonia flavour. The enzyme activity also develops the colour, texture and flavour of the cheese generally. Again, the length of time depends on the type of gorgonzola: 50-60 days of ageing produces gorgonzola dolce, which has a soft, soured-cream flavour and just a few light veins; 80 days and beyond, meanwhile, produces the richer, firmer, possibly crumblier and certainly more varicose-veined gorgonzola piccante. Depending on your taste, you can use either dolce or piccante for potato, pumpkin, sage and gorgonzola, which is inspired by a dish served at a homely and exceptional osteria called Iotto in Campagnano di Roma. You want about 75-100g gorgonzola per person if it is a main dish (for two), and 50g a head if it’s a side dish (to feed four). Potato, pumpkin, sage and gorgonzola is, I think, a heavenly combination of flavours: four strong ingredients that can’t stop complimenting each other. It is also an easygoing dish, so even though I have given quantities, please adjust the proportions as you like; more potato than pumpkin, the amount of cheese … Though one thing I would encourage you to keep generous is the sage, which is very much an ingredient here, not a garnish. It lends its musty-lemon flavour to the other ingredients and bakes into brittle crisps, a brilliant match for the sweet pumpkin and rich cheese. Sausages, unsurprisingly, go extremely well with this, as do grilled pork chops and roast chicken. I imagine it would work with rice or couscous, too. It also stands alone, as a lovely main course, with a well-dressed green leaf and herb salad, and more cheese after.

2/28/2022,"What do you write after winning the Booker prize? A fine problem to have, to be sure, yet the question of how to follow success – of whether to stick or twist, creatively speaking – hardly seems simple, at least to judge by the number of writers yet to publish another novel since winning.Post-Booker paralysis hasn’t been an issue for the Jamaican novelist Marlon James, now more than 1,000 pages deep into an ongoing trilogy. After winning in 2015 with his third book, A Brief History of Seven Killings, about the attempted assassination of Bob Marley, he thought of writing a “quiet, literary” narrative about Jamaicans in New York; instead came 2019’s Black Leopard, Red Wolf, a gore-slathered fantasy epic in a mythical ancient Africa of warring kingdoms, roamed by a ragtag band of superpower-boosted antiheroes, including a 300-year-old witch, Sogolon, hunting down a swarm of child-murdering demons.A gruelling, invigorating reading experience rife with contradictions, it widened the horizons of swords-and-sorcery narratives while presenting a lurid vision of Africa to rival anything in the imperialist make-believe of H Rider Haggard. It was hard not to wonder if the fluid sexuality of the central characters, combined with the story’s late-arriving anti-patriarchal thrust, somehow served to green light the excesses of its expletive-laden, groin-fixated splatterfest. Hard not to suspect, too, that the relentless chopping-and-fucking emphasis served as counterweight to a literary artist’s anxiety about writing a book whose ambitions lay not only in decolonising the fantasy genre but also in recapturing the heady rush of devouring Star Wars novelisations and X-Men comics in his youth. Moon Witch, Spider King, the second instalment, dials down, just a touch, the gut-clenching grotesquerie that characterised the first book. For the most part, it’s an origin story fleshing out Sogolon’s emotional stake in the search for a dead child with which the earlier book began. The action unfolds as a kind of nomadic picaresque centred on her flight from her downtrodden girlhood, in which salvation repeatedly heralds a new form of captivity, whether she’s on the run from her abusive brothers or the royal court where, as a servant, she gets a backstairs view of a succession drama she unwittingly fuels thanks to her lethal telekinetic ability to blow people up from inside, used inadvertently to fend off the predatory head of the household she’s taken into after escaping a brothel.Like its predecessor, this is a long book, scaled to satisfy the genre’s typically pig-out portions, yet with an uncompromising prose style that shuns easy-reading propulsion. Despite the unglossed vocabulary, the novel’s diction tends to be relatively straightforward: in a childbirth scene, for instance, we read that “everything is wet wet wet and red red red” (typically, we’re also shown “the afterbirth in the corner luring flies”). The difficulty lies more in the book’s enviable confidence that we’ll be able to grasp, say, who’s speaking without the narrative making it crystal-clear, or James’s relaxed attitude to (for example) using three different names for the same character in a single paragraph. The result is that a chronic fog, strobe-lit by regular flashes of sex and violence, overlays the big picture weirdness, tricky enough in itself to keep track of, with dreams and occasional interludes in an airborne city mixing with a ground-floor reality that isn’t exactly humdrum, to say the least. In that childbirth scene – a mid-book swerve into domestic marital drama – Sogolon gives birth to “lion cubs”, and she’s not talking figuratively; as she points out, in this world “a shape shifter is nothing strange... and anyway my middle brother used to fuck a snake”.In short, there’s a huge amount going on, and yet the novel’s habit of never staying any place long, combined with its studied indeterminacy about what’s actually happening – Sogolon might be 170 years old, not 300, and isn’t, it turns out, even called Sogolon – serves as an extreme test of stamina. Repeated boss-level clashes with a memory-wiping demigod, the Aesi, don’t come clearly enough into definition to generate real suspense, and despite a lengthy dramatis personae, the book’s only substantial relationship involves Keme, the half-lion father of Sogolon’s aforementioned cubs. By far the most impactful scene involves the frenzied bouts of coupling that ensue after one of their brood is felled in a raid by demons; when Keme wildly beckons a surviving child to come and watch him and Sogolon in the act of making another sibling, it’s a troublingly strange moment with an authentic psychological frisson, rare in a novel intent on baser thrills.All the same, anyone who stays the course through all this probably won’t want to miss the final instalment to come: a swerve into horror, apparently. On the basis of what’s already been published, that ought to make us shudder in more ways than one – perhaps with a tinge of anticipation, too, for that peaceful novel about Jamaicans in New York.

2/28/2022,"The California agency that serves as a last resort for crime survivors and families of crime victims in need of financial support gave out nearly $6m less in the first year of the pandemic than it did in the year before, an analysis of the agency’s annual reports reveals, with compensation declining for all major types of crime apart from homicides. The rise in homicide compensations reflect the stark uptick in gun violence during the pandemic, a rise whose impact has been most acutely felt by Black and Latino Americans. But the decline in overall payments renews questions about gaps in the program that advocates say make it difficult for those in need to collect compensation. California’s victim compensation board (CalVCB) paid out over $52m between 1 July 2020 and 30 June 2021 to crime victims in the state, according to the agency’s annual reports. The vast majority of the money allotted, over $40m, was paid out to victims of assault, homicide and child abuse. Payments to family members of murder victims rose by $2m compared with the year before, data shows. But compensation to victims of other types of crimes declined across the board. The program saw a sharp decline in applications for compensation,data indicates, with 40,600 claims submitted, 10,000 less than the year before. The board also denied 900 more applications in 2020 than 2019, according to CalVCB’s statistics. Heather Jones, a representative for the board, pointed to the pandemic hampering their outreach efforts as the reason behind the drop in applications in a statement to the Guardian. But even before the pandemic, officials and advocates argued CalVCB was in need of reform. A recent memo by California’s state committee on revision of the penal code, a state group formed in 2020 to comb through California’s legal system and recommend changes that would improve equity and efficiency, highlighted some of the longstanding shortcomings of the program. California created its victim compensation program in 1965, the first state to do so in the US. The program is mainly funded by restitution – money someone is ordered to pay after being convicted of a crime – and is used to help victims pay for funerals, medical bills and income loss if they take time off of work. A reimbursement is only granted once someone exhausts payments from sources like workers’ compensation benefits or a civil lawsuit settlement. If someone proves that they don’t have any insurance or way to pay for a funeral or hospital stay, they may qualify for an upfront emergency payment. But among the requirements to receive compensation is cooperation with police, a non-starter for some families living in communities that are both most impacted by gun violence and over-policing and mass incarceration. Families of victims also can’t claim compensation if the victim, according to police, was involved in the crime or had gang ties. Advocates argue that such conditions make claims over dependent on police officers’ account of an incident. And while applicants can appeal a denial, they have to come up with their own evidence that can prove their cooperation with police and that their loved one was not responsible for their own slaying. In Alameda county, where Oakland is located, a 2020 grand jury investigation found that Black applicants were more than twice as likely to be denied for non-cooperation than white victims. Red tape and lack of outreach not only puts an additional strain on grieving families, it can also keep the cycle of violence going, said Jasmine Hardison, coordinator of the Khadafy Washington Project, a homicide response program through Oakland’s Youth Alive!, a non-profit violence prevention and youth development organization. Support funds can make a massive difference in the lives of victims and their families, Hardison said. “People who are on the lower side of the socioeconomic scale have to rely on these resources to pay for hospital expenses,” she said. “Often we find that people don’t have life insurance, they’re in subsidized housing and they may be working full time, but they’re still falling below the poverty line. Finances can add another traumatic layer to the scenario,” she explained. In 2021, the average cost of a funeral in the US was over $7,800, about $500 higher than it was five years ago, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. And if the person survives their gunshot wounds, they and their families have to shoulder potentially tens of thousands of dollars in surgeries, physical therapy and home renovations if someone’s mobility is impacted by their injuries. At the same time, the pandemic has exacerbated unemployment and housing insecurity, factors that drive gun violence among lower-income Black and Latino residents and add layers of stress onto already fragile communities. By the time the state’s 2020 fiscal year began in July, the loss of schools, jobs and youth centers was being felt by lower income Black and Latino residents and reflected in a gradual increase in killings that would last through 2021 in cities like Oakland and Los Angeles. Hardison’s own son, 21-year-old David McDaniel was shot and killed in 2016. Through support from the Khadafy Washington Project she was able to get victim compensation and long term services to help her deal with the trauma, support she said was vital since she was unable to work for two years after her son was killed. She took up her new role in late 2020, collecting victims’ belongings from police, picking out caskets and walking families through the victim compensation process. About half of the people she meets aren’t aware of the state’s victim’s compensation, Hardison said, and those who do know before meeting her find out from neighbors who have also been impacted by violence. “More hurt people will hurt people,” Hardison said about the decline in payouts. “There’s still this stigma about who is and isn’t a victim, and families have to suffer because of that,” she said.",News/US news,"California’s victim compensation doled out $6m less in 2020, revealing gaps in crucial program",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/28/californias-victim-compensation-less-funds-2020-program-gaps
2/28/2022,"“A liveable and sustainable future for all”. It is the very last words of the new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that spell out what is at stake. In short, it is everything. The damage from global heating is already hitting hard. The comprehensive IPCC assessment, which is based on 34,000 studies, documents “widespread and pervasive” impacts on people and the natural world from increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, storms and floods. Some impacts are now irreversible. Heat is killing more people, drought is killing more trees and warming oceans are killing more coral reefs, the nurseries of the oceans. But without action, worse is coming, the report said, and faster than scientists had thought. The new report analyses the impacts of the climate crisis and how humanity can adapt, in addition to slashing emissions. The good news is that a liveable future remains within grasp – just. But the window of opportunity for action is “brief and rapidly closing”. The response from UN secretary-general António Guterres was stark: “Delay is death.” But tackling climate impacts alone will not work. The IPCC sets out in the strongest terms to date that the climate crisis is inseparable from the biodiversity crisis and the poverty and inequality suffered by billions of people. Given this scope, and with a liveable future on the line, the assessment could be seen as one of the most important in human history. It was produced by more than 1,000 physical and social scientists and unanimously approved by the governments of 195 nations. “I have seen many scientific reports in my time, but nothing like this,” said Guterres. Laurence Tubiana, at the European Climate Foundation and one of the architects of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, said the report was “brutal” and “there can be no more excuses” for inaction. Already, 3.5 billion people are highly vulnerable to climate impacts and half the world’s population suffers severe water shortages at some point each year, the report said. One in three people are exposed to deadly heat stress, and this is projected to increase to 50% to 75% by the end of the century. Half a million more people are at risk of serious flooding every year, and a billion living on coasts will be exposed by 2050, the report said. Rising temperatures and rainfall are increasing the spread of diseases in people, such as dengue fever, and in crops, livestock and wildlife. Even if the world keeps heating below 1.6C by 2100 – and we are already at 1.1C – then 8% of today’s farmland will become climatically unsuitable, just after the global population has peaked above 9 billion. Severe stunting could affect 1 million children in Africa alone. If global heating continues and little adaptation is put in place, 183 million more people are projected to go hungry by 2050. The ability to produce food relies on the water, soils and pollination provided by a healthy natural world, and the report said protection of wild places and wildlife is fundamental to coping with the climate crisis. But animals and plants are being exposed to climatic conditions not experienced for tens of thousands of years. Half of the studied species have already been forced to move and many face extinction. Maintaining the resilience of nature at a global scale depends on the conservation of 30% to 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater and oceans, the IPCC report said. Today, less than 15% of land, 21% of freshwater and 8% of oceans are protected areas, and some regions, like the Amazon, have switched from storing carbon to emitting it. The IPCC report is also crystal clear that adapting to the climate crisis is as much a social problem as a scientific one. The best way to give effective and lasting protection from climate chaos is through action that addresses “inequities such as those based on gender, ethnicity, disability, age, location and income”. “Targeting a climate resilient, sustainable world involves fundamental changes to how society functions, including changes to underlying values, world-views, ideologies, social structures, political and economic systems, and power relationships,” the report’s authors said in an accompanying document. “This may feel overwhelming at first, but the world is changing anyway – climate-resilient development offers us ways to drive change to improve wellbeing for all.” The report warned that climate “losses and damages” are “strongly concentrated among the poorest vulnerable populations”, who have done least to cause the problem. That is a significant phrase, echoing the “loss and damage” for which low-income nations are demanding compensation from rich nations, and which will be a key issue at the next UN climate summit in Egypt in November. Madeleine Diouf Sarr, the chair of the Least Developed Countries at the UN climate talks, said: “I read this report with a great deal of fear and sadness, but not surprise. It’s very clear to us that no amount of adaptation can compensate for failing to limit warming to 1.5C.” However, the regional analysis in the IPCC report demonstrates that the climate crisis affects everyone. In North America, it warns of increasing deaths and physical and mental illness due to greater extreme weather, from storms to wildfires. In Europe, “substantive agricultural production losses are projected for most areas over the 21st century”. Australia faces “increases in heat-related mortality and morbidity for people and wildlife”, while “destruction” lies in wait for small island settlements. In central and south America, “severe health effects due to increasing epidemics” are anticipated, particularly from diseases spread by insects and other animals. Among the most populous continents, one of Asia’s greatest risks is flooding, and Africa is haunted by hunger as climate impacts hit farmers. The IPCC message that hope remains is measured: “Near-term actions that limit global warming to close to 1.5°C would substantially reduce projected losses and damages related to climate change in human systems and ecosystems, but cannot eliminate them all.” Some low-lying areas appear doomed already. The report also noted that “losses and damages escalate with every increment of global warming”, meaning every action to cut emissions or adapt matters. Adaptation is heavily underfunded, the IPCC said, but investment now is far cheaper than acting later. Among the adaptation measures the IPCC cites are restoring wetlands to protect against flooding, greening the world’s fast-growing cities to cool them, and using trees to shade crops and livestock. The IPCC scientists said the end of the century is less than a lifetime away, with a child born today being 78 years old in 2100: “Actions taken now will have a profound effect on the quality of our children’s lives.” The future is in the decisions we make today, said Christiana Figueres, former UN climate chief and now at the Global Optimism group: “We can prevent and protect ourselves from extreme weather, famines, health problems and more by cutting emissions and investing in adaptation strategies. The science and the solutions are clear. It’s up to us how we shape the future.”",News/Environment,"This climate crisis report asks: what is at stake?
