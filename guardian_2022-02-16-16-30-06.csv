2/16/2022,"Marko Štambuk arrived at Belgrade district prison on a Monday morning in late January, only to be told his client was no longer inside. “Immediately I knew something had happened,” he said. Štambuk, a lawyer, had spent the previous Friday frantically obtaining an injunction from the European court of human rights (ECHR) demanding Serbian authorities halt the extradition of his client, Ahmed Jaafar Mohamed Ali, a Bahraini dissident. This banned the Serbian authorities from extraditing Ali until late February, and warned them that doing so would constitute a rare breach of the European convention on human rights.  After a frantic search, Štambuk discovered that two Serbian police officers had taken Ali from the prison to Belgrade airport that morning at 4am, and handed him to Bahraini officials on the tarmac. Just after 5am, Ali was flown directly to Manama on a charter flight operated by Royal Jet, a luxury airline headed by a member of the Abu Dhabi ruling family and part-owned by Presidential Flight, the company responsible for transporting members of the Abu Dhabi government. “The shock was intense,” said Štambuk, taken aback by Serbia’s decision to go ahead with the extradition. “He was sent back to Bahrain, I don’t know what will happen to him. If he’s sentenced to life in prison again, I don’t assume he will survive for much longer,” he said. Bahrain considered Ali a high-value suspect, convicting him in absentia on three separate counts of terrorism in 2013 and 2015. Ali, a labour activist, insisted he was innocent in a letter to a Serbian court, writing that he could prove that he was not in Bahrain at the time the alleged offences occurred. “I don’t have any relation [sic] with the case,” he pleaded. Ali’s case shows how anti-democratic regimes are increasingly able to target exiled dissidents, exporting their domestic crackdown on dissent. His extradition also provoked questions about the role of Interpol, amid mounting concerns about abuse of the policing organisation’s “red notice” system intended to flag criminals overseas. The high-profile extradition also represents the first case of its kind under the Interpol presidency of Emirati security official Ahmed Naser Al-Raisi, accused of involvement in torture by former detainees. Interpol is a supranational police force that provides investigational support to member countries, notably through information sharing within its red notice system. Bahrain’s interior ministry described Ali’s capture from Serbia as a “joint operation”, with Interpol, while its public prosecution later said that Ali was “extradited from Serbia with the help of Interpol”. A spokesperson for Interpol emphasised that its general secretariat, based in Lyon, was not informed of Ali’s extradition, and that responsibility for the operation fell to Interpol’s National Central Bureaus, or NCBs, the domestic point of contact for Interpol in each member country. “The return of fugitives and wanted persons is a bilateral matter between member countries and the Interpol general secretariat is not involved in this process,” the spokesperson said. “Interpol’s general secretariat cannot instruct NCBs on whether to arrest an individual or refrain from doing so, whether to engage in extradition proceedings, etc. Such decisions are exclusively within the discretion of the competent national authorities of member countries.” Interpol’s role in Ali’s extradition remains uncertain. “In a clear effort to legitimise this illegal extradition, Bahrain has portrayed this as a cooperative operation with Interpol. This is a serious manipulation and abuse of international policing, which has destroyed the life of a dissident. This case is indicative of the inherently flawed nature of Interpol’s broken red notice system which has for too long been left vulnerable and open to abuse,” said Sayed Alwadaei of the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy. Whatever role Interpol ultimately played in Ali’s extradition, his arrest in Belgrade last November was a direct result of an Interpol red notice against him issued in 2015. Ali soon found himself on a journey through the Serbian court system towards extradition to Bahrain, with few opportunities to convince the Serbian authorities of the risks he faced. “The red notice was the starting point for him, for this entire story,” said Štambuk. “In all cases that I’ve worked on, whether asylum or extradition, the red notice is always the starting point.” Interpol issues an estimated 10,000 red notices each year, according to criminal justice watchdog Fair Trials, who wrote to Interpol’s general secretariat in 2017 to warn that Bahrain’s use of the red notice system to target dissidents “could amount to a violation of Interpol’s constitutional rules on political neutrality and human rights”. Ali’s red notice, issued in 2015, likely occurred up to a year before Interpol established what a spokesperson described as a specialised taskforce to screen requests from member countries before publication. The taskforce comprises a team of up to 40 people, but little else is known about the screening process. When Ali’s lawyers contacted the Commission for the Control of Interpol’s Files (CCF) in 2019, a separate body which reviews data contained in red notices, the CCF told them to “contact the relevant national authorities” in Bahrain concerning accusations against him. “We don’t doubt that the abuses of the red notice system are a minority of the total,” said Bruno Min of Fair Trials. “But if for example Interpol were able to say that they reject a certain number of red notices per year, you could be satisfied that the screening process actually works. At the moment they’re not giving us that kind of information.” The Bahraini authorities accuse Ali of multiple terrorism-related charges, including bomb-making and complicity in the murder of three policemen, including one from the UAE. Rights groups say that similar charges are often levelled at protesters who took part in anti-government protests in 2011, and many such as Ali fled in the intervening years. Three other men also accused of murdering police officials in the same case were executed in 2017, after a trial where UN observers accused Bahraini officials of extracting false confessions using torture. One later labelled the executions “extrajudicial killings” based on an “unfair trial and flimsy evidence”. As Ali’s case moved through the Serbian justice system, he wrote three letters to the courts in an attempt to convince them of the risks he faced if extradited. “I fear for my life and the wellbeing of my family,” he wrote last December, telling them that he had come to Serbia to seek asylum hoping that they would be safe. He was intimately aware of the risks, having described the torture he had endured almost a decade earlier in Bahrain to Human Rights Watch. But the red notice left him unable to shake the accusation that he was a wanted criminal. On 18 January, Serbia’s justice ministry approved Ali’s extradition order to the Gulf state. This came after a year of increasingly warm relations between the two countries, including the first state visit by a Serbian president when Aleksandar Vučić flew to the Bahraini capital Manama in March last year and “committed to further deepening political and economic ties between Serbia and the Kingdom of Bahrain”. “I absolutely believe that the [Serbian] government resolves extradition cases in different ways depending on which countries they’re working with, and not thinking about the life of the person involved,” said Sonja Tošković of the Belgrade Centre for Human Rights, who pointed to multiple international conventions banning extradition to countries where detainees risk abuse. “You’re playing with human life. It’s devastating,” she said. The Guardian understands that the judge overseeing Ali’s case received a call from the Serbian interior ministry the day before his extradition. An interior ministry official told the judge that Interpol understood a temporary injunction had been issued by the European Court of Human Rights, intended to stall Ali’s extradition until late February. The interior ministry official wanted to know how to proceed with the case, and whether they had permission to remove Ali from prison in Belgrade. The judge penned a memo to transfer the decision about whether to extradite Ali to the justice ministry, in line with procedure. Time was of the essence: the private jet to collect Ali had landed at Belgrade seven minutes before the judge received the call, having left Abu Dhabi for Manama and flown to Belgrade the same day. Serbian authorities were later forced to explain to the ECHR why they chose to ignore the interim measure, and violate the convention on human rights. In a statement, they said the extradition went ahead as “a consequence of a short time between the issuance of the interim measure to the time of the extradition of the applicant”. “Serbia and Interpol have effectively destroyed Ahmed’s life with this illegal extradition,” said Alwadaei. “They acted in clear violation of international laws. Serbia breached its international obligations. Once more, Interpol has allowed itself to be abused by an authoritarian regime.” A coalition of rights groups also wrote to Royal Jet to demand answers about why it had allowed airline to be used to extradite a dissident. “We fear that by using your company’s aircrafts to carry out Mr Ali’s wrongful extradition, you may have played an active role in violating the ECHR’s interim measures and article 3 of the UN Convention against Torture,” they said. The Serbian justice ministry, the UAE foreign ministry and Royal Jet did not respond to requests for comment. Bahraini authorities previously told the Guardian that Ali faced no risk of mistreatment on return home, and referred further questions to a recent statement by public prosecutors. This states that “the Public Prosecution sought the death penalty for the accused,” but the court upheld Ali’s three life sentences and added a fourth. Alwadaei and Min are among those calling for Interpol to examine its handling of Ali’s case in order to prevent similar problems in future. An Interpol spokesperson said the general secretariat “is constantly reviewing, assessing and updating its procedures to ensure the greatest level of integrity in the system, and trust in its work”, when asked if the case could provoke any internal review.",News/Global development,‘Illegal’ extradition of Bahraini dissident from Serbia calls Interpol’s role into question,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/16/extradition-of-bahraini-dissident-from-serbia-calls-interpol-role-into-question
2/16/2022,"The International Olympic Committee has dismissed claims that a double standard was applied to US sprinter Sha’Carri Richardson compared to Russian skater Kamila Valieva after both tested positive for a banned drug. Richardson missed last year’s summer Games in Tokyo after receiving a 30-day ban for smoking cannabis, a drug few believe is performance enhancing, saying she had done so to relieve the pain she felt over the recent death of her mother.  Meanwhile on Monday the court of arbitration for sport has allowed Valieva to continue to compete at the Winter Games in Beijing despite it emerging that the 15-year-old Russian had tested positive for the angina drug trimetazidine, a more serious offence. Earlier this week Richardson had suggested that the colour of her skin was behind the discrepancy, adding: “Can we get a solid answer on the difference of her situation and mine? The only difference I see is I’m a black young lady.” Others have suggested that the IOC has been soft on Russia compared to the US. However IOC spokesman Mark Adams insisted that that was not the case. “You can’t talk about double standards in relation to Russian and American athletes, each case is individual,” he added. “Richardson’s positive doping test was discovered on 19 June, and the result was received before the start of the Olympics. She was suspended for a month. There is nothing in common between these two cases.” In its ruling, Cas said banning Valieva “would cause her irreparable harm” and she took her place in the women’s skating competition, where she leads at the halfway stage. However Cas’s ruling was solely on whether the teenager can compete again in Beijing and she could still be banned from competition over the failed test in the coming weeks. Adams also confirmed that an asterisk would be placed against the women’s figure skating competition until the conclusion of Valieva’s doping case. “This Games, which has not concluded, concerns an issue in December,” he said. “ She is in the centre of a lot of speculation. It must be very tough for her. We of course are in touch with the team, her welfare is the team’s first priority, and obviously we are very careful of that but there’s only so much that we can do.”",Sport/Sport,IOC deny Richardson’s accusations of double standards over Valieva,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/16/ioc-deny-richardsons-accusations-of-double-standards-over-valieva

2/16/2022,"Idiscovered I was pregnant unexpectedly, in November 2019. My body quickly began to make it clear that my experience was not going to match society’s dominant image of a glowing, happy and relaxed pregnancy. After almost five months of constant nausea – which felt as if I was trying to hide my worst hangover every single day – I hit what I thought was rock bottom. I turned to Google for an answer to my question: “Is it normal to feel miserable when you’re pregnant?” and realised that I ticked all the boxes for antenatal depression. There was a slight sense of relief that I wasn’t the first person to feel like this. But the problem felt too big for me to deal with, and too jarring with what was expected – happiness and smiles – for me to seek any help. In March, the nausea finally began to subside, and that was enough for me to shrug off my suspicions of depression. I returned to my weekly dance class and was hopeful I could finally get back to being me. Then, on 23 March, we entered lockdown. I spent the next three months seeing virtually no one apart from my partner. I wandered around Tottenham Marshes and managed two garden meet-ups with my mum.  In the summer, when I was 35 weeks pregnant, I went to a routine checkup, and was told that my baby’s heart rate was too high. The appointment was at the Tottenham Hotspur stadium – they had moved the antenatal unit out of North Middlesex university hospital to try to limit the spread of Covid infections. The midwives told me they were sending me to the hospital for further checks and there was a small chance the baby would have to be born that day. I offered to walk. They exchanged looks and insisted I go in an ambulance. I always assume I’ll be fine, in all situations. I have been conditioned to believe I am a robust person who can shake off illness, pain and discomfort. I am mixed-race and grew up in a small, predominantly white seaside town and I am 6ft tall; the delicate female narrative was not applied to me. I am strong. I was raised by a strong woman to be a strong woman. So, in the ambulance, while the paramedics were taking my details, I was on the phone to my partner reassuring him: “It’ll be fine and I’ll be home shortly.” I’m sure the paramedics knew I wouldn’t be home shortly. The baby’s heart rate was checked again. A consultant told me the baby was ill, they didn’t know what was wrong and they needed him out as soon as possible. I phoned my partner back and as soon as he said hello, my “strong woman” facade fell to the floor. I couldn’t speak. Tears stuck in my throat. The midwife explained to him that I needed an emergency caesarean section and he should come as quickly as he could. My baby was born within the hour. I saw him for about 30 seconds, and marvelled at the beautifully long eyelashes escaping from his closed eyes, then he was taken to the neonatal ward. Because of Covid, only one parent at a time was allowed to visit the baby. We did shifts; mine were the longest for many reasons that didn’t need to be vocalised. There was no chance our family could come to the hospital, or our home. So I was strong again. We were fortunate: our gorgeous boy came home 10 days later. My health visitor came round two days after, and that was the last I heard from her. No one ever answered when I rang – the number I’d been given for the community midwife always rang out. Covid meant that my personal support network was taken away, but I hadn’t been prepared for the professional support network to disappear too. Then came the third lockdown of Christmas 2020. The limited connection I had with my family and friends was torn away, again. And with it went my ability to cope. By the time February 2021 came around, I felt as if I had nothing left to give. One day, I sat on my bed knowing I had to get up and make the baby some lunch; he was about seven months old, but I couldn’t move. My whole body felt so heavy, I was a dead weight. I knew I had to go to the baby in the living room but I couldn’t get up. I just couldn’t face it any more. The obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) that I had silently lived with since I was a teenager had become unmanageable. I knew I hadn’t been OK for a long time. I hadn’t managed to shrug off my depression because that’s not how it works. I glossed over it, but for the first time in my life it wasn’t working. The feeling was getting worse and it was interfering with my ability to be a mother; it was destroying my relationship with my partner; it was eating away at me. I phoned my GP and explained that I thought I had postnatal depression. I was referred for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). The sessions gave me the space to talk about my OCD for the first time, and opened my eyes to the fact that I have always struggled with anxiety, and that I don’t have to try to gloss over it. They taught me that I had to undo my way of thinking about stressful situations. I had to realise it wasn’t healthy, but harmful. Like any journey of self-learning, it’s a process. Having a baby in a pandemic nearly broke me. I had to learn not only how to be a mother, but how to rebuild myself. But, on reflection, it’s not just me who could benefit from some rethinking. If we as a society are more open to the nuances and realities of pregnancy, women will put less pressure on themselves to live up to unrealistic expectations. They may then seek the help they need sooner. Marshall’s GP referred her to IAPT for talking therapy and CBT.

2/16/2022,"Lateral flow tests (LFTs) are an increasing part of our everyday lives. But for some individuals, a persistent clash with their PCR test results is undermining their confidence in the system. The Guardian has been contacted by hundreds of people who have repeatedly tested positive on lateral flow devices (LFDs), but whose confirmatory PCR tests have been relentlessly negative.  Amy Lewis’s son Josh, nine, has tested positive on LFTs six times in the past eight months. “The biggest implication was that we were supposed to go to Guernsey to see my family for Christmas, but we decided not to go, because [of the testing requirements]. We couldn’t put Josh through the emotional upheaval of that,” said Lewis, from Bristol. “What has been frustrating is the lack of recognition that this is an issue, or that it might be possible.” Anna Brading of Reading received a warning from her son’s headteacher, because he had missed so much school as a result of having to self-isolate. “We have no way of telling when he actually gets Covid and I have vulnerable family members that we want to see,” she said. Barbara Mann, 35, of Monmouth, believes her LFTs may be detecting some other virus. “There are always two lines, sometimes the second is faint, sometimes strong,” she said. “It seems to depend if I’m feeling under the weather or not.” Scientists stressed that, because no test is 100% accurate, some contradictory results should be expected – but for those with multiple conflicting results, something else could be going on. “It is important that we get to the bottom of this to resolve the uncertainty for the people whose lives are being thrown into confusion by these seemingly erroneous results,” said Dr Kit Yates, a mathematical biologist at the University of Bath. So, what are the possible explanations? With so many LFTs and PCR tests being done at the moment, some people will get a run of false positives and false negatives, even though the statistical probability of this is low. “The main reason people may get a mismatch between a LFT and PCR is likely to do with the sensitivity and specificity of the tests,” said Irene Petersen, a professor of epidemiology and health informatics at UCL. “In short, when we have a high prevalence of Covid, as we do right now, it is much more likely that a positive LFT is correct than a negative PCR test is correct.” Nevertheless, the chances of people randomly testing positive on multiple lateral flow tests over long periods of time and without symptoms is extremely low, said Yates. “Consistent false negatives – perhaps due to poor swabbing technique – would be easier to explain away, but not false positives.” In October, UKHSA suspended PCR testing at a laboratory in Wolverhampton after an investigation into reports of people receiving negative PCR results after a positive LFT. “Hopefully that isn’t happening again,” said Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology, at the University of Reading. Another possibility is that the swab collected for the PCR test was inadequate, or that by the time the PCR test was taken, the infection had gone away. The simplest technical explanation would be some kind of interference in the assay – similar to reports of schoolchildren pouring orange juice or cola on their LFTs to fake a positive Covid test. “It’s thought that acid or acidic solutions can cause the antibodies in the test which detect Covid to clump together, which may appear to give a positive result,” Yates said. “One potential hypothesis, therefore, is that these false positive could be related to people’s diets. This is why the tests suggest you don’t take them until at least 30 minutes after eating.” Cross-reactivity with other circulating coronaviruses could also be a possibility, Yates said. “These are all just hypotheses though. In reality we will need to undertake a more detailed study to understand why some people consistently light up lateral flow tests.” Because different manufacturers use different reagents in their test kits, some kits may be more susceptible to this problem than others, Edwards suggested. Indeed, many Guardian readers claim to only test positive on certain brands of LFT – particularly FlowFlex kits. A UKHSA spokesperson said: “All lateral flow devices used by NHS test and trace have gone through rigorous validation and are proven to be highly effective at detecting Covid-19 in those that are infectious.” Even so, Edwards pointed out that such studies involve testing a certain number of samples under a defined set of conditions: “It does not really reflect the accuracy of the product in real life, and it is not designed to do that.” For any diagnostic test, there are likely to be outliers who produce unusual results: “It could be something as simple as maybe some people have acidic saliva or something like that,” Edwards said. Petersen stressed that from a public health perspective, such cases are likely to be so rare as to be inconsequential for the overall validity of the tests. “We should remember that millions of people are testing, and on the whole these tests are working, and people should trust the results,” she said. A UKHSA spokesperson said: “[We] constantly monitor performance of LFDs in use and investigate any issues where appropriate.” They advised people to report any problems with tests via the “give feedback or report harm” section of the gov.uk website.",News/World news,Covid tests: how can people be positive on lateral flow and negative on PCRs?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/covid-tests-how-can-people-be-positive-on-lateral-flow-and-negative-on-pcrs
2/16/2022,"In his day, the 19th-century fugitive from slavery Moses Roper was a well-known public figure who toured Britain and Ireland telling gripped and shocked audiences about his horrific experiences in Florida. Today he is largely overlooked but, two Newcastle University academics argue, the important story of this fascinating man represents a “lost opportunity” for the British abolition movement to have helped end slavery in the US earlier.  Bruce Baker, a reader in American history, said it was surprising how little attention had been paid to Roper, given he was a pioneer. “Historians haven’t really paid a lot of attention to Roper, even though he was the first fugitive slave to lecture in the cause of abolition in Britain and Ireland.” Baker and his colleague Fionnghuala Sweeney, a reader in American and Black Atlantic Literatures, have now published a paper in an academic journal and are working on a full biography of Roper. They aim to rescue him from obscurity, painting a picture of a radical, driven man ruined by the British abolition movement that turned against him. Roper fled enslavement in Florida in 1834 and, fearing for his safety, made his way to Britain, where he was supported by churchmen and abolitionists. They helped fund his education and in 1837 he published the first edition of his Narrative of the Adventures and Escape of Moses Roper from American Slavery. He gave his first solo public lecture at Howard Street Chapel in Sheffield in April 1838. Later that year in Leicester, he told his audience: “You have heard the slave-holders’ story 250 years ago. Now, I think, it is time for the slaves to speak.” He lectured in villages, towns and cities across Britain and Ireland and was generally well received. But not always. The Hampshire Advertiser accused him of exaggerating the violence he suffered for effect saying no one could have inflicted as many lashes as Roper said he received. Roper, bristling, “offered to prove, on the person of the editor … that he could inflict 500 lashes … without resting”. Baker and Sweeney say: “There is no evidence that Roper’s offer was taken up.” By 1839 Roper had updated his Narrative three times, had married a British woman, and appeared to be in a good place. Baker said: “This should have been a prime moment for the British abolitionist movement to refocus its attention on ending slavery in America, with the testimony of someone who had actually experienced slavery to help push this forward, but for various reasons this does not happen.” The main reason was a falling out with a London pastor called Thomas Price, who had expected Roper to become a missionary and teach children in Africa. Price was not impressed by Roper’s career as an author and lecturer, condemning it in one published letter as a “permanent system of genteel begging”. The row had ruinous consequences for Roper, who was pushed to the margins at a critical time. It represented, said Baker, a lost opportunity for the abolition movement. “It does seem that had Roper been supported by the abolition movement in an organised way, there might have been more political pressure to do something about slavery, especially with the power of the British empire behind it. “The few years that are lost are an important time, because events are under way in North America that then, in some ways, overtake the abolition movement.” There could have been “different political opportunities had there been more of a welcome, more of a platform for black abolitionists”. Until Price’s letter, Roper had been earning a sizeable amount from book sales. Suddenly he began to lose money and feared going to prison. The Roper family moved from London to Wales and later emigrated to Canada, before returning to Wales. He died, back in the US, in 1891. ‘I Am Not a Beggar’: Moses Roper, Black Witness and the Lost Opportunity of British Abolitionism is published in the journal Slavery and Abolition.",News/World news,‘Lost opportunity’: fugitive slave ruined by 19th-century British abolitionists ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/16/moses-roper-fugitive-from-slavery-cast-aside-british-abolitionists
2/16/2022,"As a student doctor, there are a few well-loved texts that are a little different from our required reading. Sometimes, it’s these books, TV shows or films that inspired us to consider medicine as a career in the first place. Grey’s Anatomy and Call the Midwife, medical dramas with their fingers firmly on the pulse, are common reference points. Call the Midwife has brought complex health and social issues to life, from vaccination programmes to illegal abortions. Grey’s Anatomy depicts the drama of the operating theatre (not least when a patient is brought in with a bomb inside them). And my copy of Your Life in My Hands by Dr Rachel Clarke is dogeared from being passed around so many times. But Adam Kay’s grim, darkly funny memoir about life as a junior doctor, This is Going to Hurt, stands out. I read it when I applied to study medicine, then again in my first year, and then again in November 2021 after my first placement. It was recommended by a friend as a way to get a feel for working in the NHS, and I was left shocked but intrigued. It felt like a friend trying to tell you how horrible and hard their job is, all the while doing their best not to put you off. So when the TV adaptation was released, I knew I’d be hooked.  It wasn’t my first time seeing harrowing cases of placental abruptions and cord prolapses play out in a drama – I’ve had my fair share from religiously watching 11 seasons of Call the Midwife. However, seeing it depicted in a time period closer to mine was extremely vivid and, at times, horrifying. It reminded me of the reality of what was to come, and made me wonder if I was ready for it. Being covered in body fluids, faced with staff shortages, working day and night shifts back to back on little sleep – I felt as if I was watching my future, courtesy of the BBC. A future that, to be honest, I was beginning to question. For me, the storyline of the student doctor Shruti showed the very best and very worst of working in medicine. We see her start off on the back foot as a nervous junior doctor, eager to impress as she builds a friendship with Dr Kay. She faces racism from patients because of the colour of her skin. Yet while her abilities as a doctor grow, she also begins to burn out. The breaking point is a night shift, where we see her turn into a confident doctor in unimaginable circumstances, yet struggle to cope with the intensity of the situation. The picture Kay painted was of a chronically underfunded and understaffed NHS in the mid-2000s. Since then, Covid-19 has added a whole new set of pressures and challenges – from staff giving more to the job then they get back, to watching the government let the NHS down while clapping for them at the same time. So if working in the NHS is full of doom and gloom even without a pandemic, as Kay suggests, why do we dedicate five (or six) years at university, followed by years of training until we reach a senior position? Why do we opt for a career where one day, someone’s life will, very literally, be in our hands – and often under difficult circumstances? It’s difficult to pinpoint what keeps me going, but I know it includes wanting to make my parents proud, and the small moments that make the slog worthwhile. I remember helping out with taking bloods and doing examinations while on my placement at a GP’s surgery earlier this year. I didn’t do anything very groundbreaking as I’m still a second-year student, but the deep sense of satisfaction I felt as I left to get the train home stayed with me for a long time. In This is Going to Hurt, it was the small moments that showed how much NHS staff can make a difference – like the relationship between Dr Kay and an older patient. She has uterine prolapse, which is normally treated in a clinic – but after sensing her discomfort, Dr Kay decided to treat her at the bedside while chatting with her, giving her the privacy and comfort that she wanted. Sometimes, going an extra mile can make a huge difference. I see the same thing when I’m on placement on the ward. Doctors and nurses go out of their way to make patients feel comfortable, from making them a cup of tea to just listening to their worries. I also try not to lose sight of the fact that it’s a huge honour to be studying medicine. At the same time, it’s important to be realistic about what’s to come. Otherwise, it really is going to hurt.

2/16/2022,"There are three things that make me unreasonably irritated while watching TV. The first is when the person on screen hangs up the phone without any acknowledgment that the conversation is over. Nobody does that in real life. It’s sociopathic! The second is when people put their suitcase on their bed to pack or unpack (this is extremely common on reality TV). “Do you know where that suitcase has been?” I yell at the telly whenever my eyeballs are confronted with such smut. “There’s a 99.99% chance you now have faecal matter and rat urine on your sheets, you filthy animal!” Continuing that theme, my third pet peeve is when TV characters lounge on their beds with shoes on. I’m not a hygiene freak – I’ll happily eat food that has fallen on the floor even after the five-second rule has passed: I’ve always believed that a little bit of dirt a day keeps the doctor away. But I have my limits, and the idea of street shoes on a bed makes me gag. This obviously also applies to real life: I don’t care who you are, you are not setting foot in my house with shoes on. (And before you bring pets into this, let me state for the record that I wash my dog’s paws after a walk: he’s a good clean boy). Anyway, I’m not going to bother going into all the statistics about how there are apparently 421,000 units of bacteria on the outside of an average shoe, or how 93% of shoes will have poo on them after a month of normal use. I am not going to bother trying to argue this topic because, unlike most issues in life, there is no room for debate here: only a barbarian wears outdoor shoes indoors.  Clearly, I’m not alone in thinking this. Every week the internet chooses something to get collectively apocalyptical about and last week’s theme, as my fellow Twitter addicts will know, was shoes. You can blame the Wall Street Journal for starting the fuss. They published a piece they clearly hoped would go viral titled Here’s Why I’ll Be Keeping My Shoes on in Your Shoeless Home. To be clear: the article was supposed to be lighthearted. But a key tenet of modern life is that 98% of people do not read beyond the headline (congratulations to you for making it this far), nor do they read between the lines. And, to be fair, the piece was lighthearted in a deliberately irritating way. It was the semantic equivalent of someone jabbing you repeatedly with their index finger while going “jokejokejokejokejoke” and hoping for a reaction. And it certainly achieved that. Someone called it “imperialist” (not me, although that is definitely something I would say). Someone else called it a “hate crime”. And an overwhelming number of people suggested that only a white-presenting person could have written such a piece. Dear white people reading this, I’m going to say this as delicately as possible but I’m afraid you have something of a reputation when it comes to cleanliness. Last year, for example, there was a heated online debate about white people not washing their legs in the shower. This followed on from a debate, instigated by a white person, about whether swimming counts as bathing. Then there are all the rich white celebrities who love boasting about how they don’t like washing themselves (Jake Gyllenhaal), their kids (Ashton Kutcher), or their clothes (Stella McCartney). When you are a non-white person who has to deal with stereotypes about “dirty foreigners” it can be grating, to say the least, to see privileged white people revel in being disgusting. But, you know what? I’m not going into the racialised aspects of hygiene discourse here. Instead, I would like to ask a member of the white community to come forward and condemn the grotesque actions of some of your wearing-boots-inside brethren. If white people want to be good allies, it’s time to take a stand! But not in your dirty shoes, obviously.

2/16/2022,"“These prosecutors are rummaging in my closets, hoping to find skeletons. But all they will find are my beautiful clothes.” So says the fictional Marija Popa, adapting an infamous phrase from Imelda Marcos, the former first lady of the Philippines, as she prepares to stand trial for her late husband’s crimes. Popa is the anti-heroine of The Dictator’s Wife, a debut novel by a young British Indian writer, Freya Berry, that explores how tyrants deploy glamorous spouses to soften their image: velvet gloves to their iron fists.  The book poses an important question: to what extent should such women be judged as complicit in their husbands’ regimes? They are often survivors of brutal patriarchy and lack genuine political power. But do they, too, have blood on their hands? When we encounter Popa in the novel, she has endured the murder of her husband Constantin, a keen student of Hitler’s charisma who enriched himself at the expense of impoverished Yanussia, a fictional eastern European country. Now the former actor and businesswoman is defiant as she faces a possible conviction and death sentence. The story is narrated by Laura Lăzărescu, a young London lawyer working on the case and starstruck by this enigmatic “black widow”. “It was true: you could not take your eyes off her,” Lăzărescu says. “It allowed her husband to get on with what he enjoyed, namely recruiting foreign ministers as spies, stealing US military secrets and extracting his country’s wealth, while she was everything and nothing. You could not measure her influence on any known scale, but it was there, like dark matter.” The mesmerised narrator wonders aloud about the impact of these women, raising issues not too detached from ones we might ask about our own, real-life dictators’ wives. Why does the media fawn over their closets and philanthropic habits? And does the fixation on the glamour help disguise the darkness of their husbands’ deeds? In a Zoom interview from a bedroom at her parents’ home in Bristol, Berry lists sources of inspiration for the fictional Popa, including Asma al-Assad of Syria, Elena Ceaușescu of Romania and Eva Perón of Argentina among a few. Popa’s trial is partly based on that of Marcos who, after the death of President Ferdinand Marcos, sat in a black mourning dress and collapsed from grief. More counterintuitively during our 50-minute conversation, the author also name-checks US first ladies Jill Biden, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump as inspirations – a cast that implies the dynamics of power, performance and sexism at issue in The Dictator’s Wife are not as unique to autocracies as the west would like to tell itself. “It’s a man’s world but these women are married to the men who make this world. I wanted to explore that duality because they’re at the eye of power but it’s slightly off to the left. They’re not paid. Their role often isn’t clear,” Berry says. “I read a line about Evita [Perón’s nickname]. Was she ‘the standard bearer of the poor’ or was she ‘the woman with the whip’? Probably neither. There are these emblematic names, ‘first lady’ or ‘steel butterfly’ or ‘mother of the nation’,” says Berry – intimating that the very institution of the first lady’s office is made to sugar the image of the “man in charge”. “No one knows what goes on behind closed doors. These are private people in public roles, a personal relationship writ into statesmanship,” Berry clarifies. “I just felt like the last time I really read about a fictional dictator’s wife was probably Lady Macbeth and I thought maybe it could do with a second look.” Now 30 and based in London, Berry worked as a financial and political journalist at Reuters before becoming an author. She reported on the US presidential election in 2016 after joining the Mail Online, where her observations of the rise of Donald Trump with Melania Trump at his side planted the seed of the novel. She recalls: “We’re run by more basic impulses than we like to admit and a beautiful woman standing to one side apparently agreeing with everything you say is usually an asset, whether we like it or not. It does soften someone and whitewash them at the same time.” That seed was watered by a Saturday Night Live sketch, not about Melania Trump but Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka. It was a parody perfume advert for “Complicit: the fragrance for the woman who could stop all this – but won’t”. Reportedly stung by the bit, which starred Scarlett Johansson, Ivanka Trump told CBS News: “If being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact then I’m complicit.” Berry quit the newsroom and travelled to eastern Europe for three months of research. She began in Romania and immediately found herself in the midst of a street protest with hundreds of thousands of people calling for the government’s resignation. A visit to the grand Ceausescu Palace in Bucharest conjured ghosts of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu and what was known as a “conjugal dictatorship” before their unceremoniously swift trial and execution. “It’s the personality cults versus the quite brutish figures that they actually were,” Berry remarks. “Elena liked to present herself as a scientist but couldn’t recognise basic chemistry formulas. That didn’t stop her getting an honorary doctorate from the Royal Society of Chemistry; there’s a campaign at the moment to get her stripped of them.” Berry read about another striking example in the Middle East: Asma al-Assad, wife of Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad, now widely considered a war criminal. In 2011 she was featured on the cover of Vogue magazine with the headline “A Rose in the Desert”, and a fawning profile that began: “Asma al-Assad is glamorous, young and very chic – the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies.” It continued: “She’s a rare combination: a thin, long-limbed beauty with a trained analytic mind who dresses with cunning understatement. Paris Match calls her ‘the element of light in a country full of shadow zones’. She is the first lady of Syria.” Assad appears to have almost a cast a spell on the profile writer, Berry observes. “Personal magnetism and charm is very hard to fight against. You look over here and you don’t look at the extrajudicial killings over there.” It is an intriguing prism through which to consider Melania Knauss, a Slovenian model who came to America married Donald Trump in 2005. With his election a decade later, she became only the second foreign-born first lady in American history – and one of the most divisive. To some, she was a bird trapped in a gilded cage, initially refusing to move to the White House, defiantly pushing Trump’s hand away and deserving of pity, hence the social media hashtag “#FreeMelania”. To others, she was a sphinx-like enabler whose silence was violence: every time she appeared at Trump’s side, she was normalising his assault on democracy. Then there were her strange gestures such as wearing a Zara jacket with “I Really Don’t Care. Do U?” written across the back or unveiling a creepy “forest” of cone-shaped crimson trees for the White House’s Christmas decorations. Both were the stuff of social media meme dreams. Mary Jordan, a biographer of Melania Trump, found her more ambitious and knowing – more like Donald Trump – than is often assumed. Berry comments: “She’s very good at disappearing, even when she’s right there, behind her sunglasses.” She points to an analysis of Melania Trump’s Instagram feed, which found that the only animal picture she posted was of a hermit crab, “which is just metaphorically excellent”, says Berry. Berry adds: “The thing about Melania is she only speaks when she wants to. She says nothing most of the time but it doesn’t mean she doesn’t say anything. She has the pussy-bow blouse and Zara jacket. She does say things when she wants to.” First ladies’ fashion choices are scrutinised in ways that would be unthinkable for their besuited husbands beyond their choice of tie colour. Conversely, not much ink has been spilled on the wardrobe choices of Doug Emhoff, second gentleman and spouse of Vice-President Kamala Harris. At one point in The Dictator’s Wife, Popa insists: “My clothes, my jewellery, they are my amulets. My protection.” The narrator adds: “Protection. Survival. She spoke the language of the hunted, yet who was her hunter?” So can fashion be an armour of sorts? Berry thinks so: “The way that these women can speak is with fashion. It’s patronised and belittled and often rightly dismissed as sexist but it is a language and it is something that is recognised and weaponised by these by these women.” She cites the recent news of Melania Trump launching a non-fungible token (NFT) – a watercolour depicting her eyes. “She called it ‘an amulet to inspire’ and I thought that was actually a perfect representation of Melania’s time in power because it’s a thing, but it’s not a thing. It’s not something you can touch. It’s a representation, an empty emblem, a hollow image, and that felt like a microcosm of her time as first lady,” explains Berry. If you want to look at the influence of a first lady’s style, look no further than Vogue, says Berry, , pointing to the image-making moment of Jill Biden’s first cover on the high fashion magazine. The 70-year-old is seen smiling, wearing a floral-patterned blue dress, leaning against a White House balcony – a wholesome contrast to Melania Trump’s opulent couture. “Same with Michelle Obama on the cover of [her memoir] Becoming,” adds Berry. “She’s in white and she’s got her shoulder bare and she’s leaning in – it’s all this feminine flowing hair, a seductive but maternal, nurturing image, whereas Barack’s obviously in a suit and looking impressive in black and white. So it goes.” In her heyday Popa, we are told, introduced an all-female staff to her factory long before “girl power” became a rallying cry. She palled around with Ronald Reagan, Paul Newman and Saddam Hussein, and was a particular favourite of the British queen. She is described as “a hypnotic blend of Joan of Arc and Imelda Marcos; both goddess and she-devil, princess and tyrant, martyr and uber-bitch”. Did Berry develop sympathy for dictators’ wives in writing Popa’s character? “How do you make your way in a man’s world? If you can’t have power yourself, you have to go adjacent to it. These women are playing for the highest stakes. If they lose power, sometimes they’re executed. It’s this bitter tooth-and-nail fight for survival while also maintaining serene perfection and femininity,” she says. “Imelda’s quite hard not to like, no matter what you think of her pretty dubious politics. So I did feel an unnerving amount of sympathy, which you have to as a novelist: you can’t just go in with that hardheaded, judgmental approach. I wanted my character, Maria, to be ambiguous, this enchanting spider at the novel’s heart. I wanted you to be a bit seduced by Maria at the same time as being probably a bit repelled or afraid of her.”  The Dictator’s Wife is published by Headline Review, and is available on Book Depository from 17 February.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Velvet gloves to iron fists: how complicit are the wives of dictators?,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/16/the-dictators-wife-novel-freya-berry
2/16/2022,"‘The Souq El Blat is the heartbeat of the medina,” proclaims Mourad Boughanmi, a medicinal herb seller in this historic quarter of Tunis. Indeed, for centuries, its herbs have sustained the bodies of people living here. Bundles of wild thyme, sage, poppy, garlic and eucalyptus have lined the walls of this shadowy souq for at least 700 years. When Covid-19 entered Tunisia in early 2020, some herbalists say demand for plant medicine grew , with greater numbers wanting to strengthen their immune systems naturally. But customs are changing, and without any state support this trade has become endangered.  Five thousand years ago the Sumerians of Mesopotamia documented the health-enhancing properties of wild plants. These early texts articulated the ancient practice of herbalism, where ecology, biology and chemistry meet. In the ensuing millennia, medicinal herbs have been picked and prepared to help with a number of ailments. In the cavernous shops of Souq El Blat, this trade lives on. Chowki El Fout in his herb shop in Souq El Blat Down Rue Bacha Hamba, Tawfiq Ben Yacoub, a herb dealer with a passion for art, history and music, has a shop with the chaotic feel of an artist’s studio: it is filled with flasks, bottles, paintings, bags of old herbs and the sweet smell of incense. He tells his story over the quiet fuzz of a radio as bleating mopeds pass by. As a boy, he would hike with his Libyan father in the green mountains near Benghazi, where he learned about medicinal herbs. He tells how 10th-century Tunisian physician Ibn al-Jazzar advanced herbal medicine in Tunisia and across north Africa. After the Islamic golden age, Ben Yacoub says, medicine stagnated across the Muslim world compared with Europe, because of weaker institutionalised scholarship. “We lost knowledge of this science when we lost the scripts,” he says. “Today our children learn about Ibn al-Jazzar, but as history rather than for scientific training.” Clockwise from top: wild thyme, fresh green almonds, dried esfand, also known as harmal, and garlic. Many of the herbalists apply a holistic, intuitive approach to healing Nearby, in his shop next to the Khilwiya Bilhassan mosque, Chowki El Fout is another herb dealer who sees his vocation as a strand in Tunisia’s rich and complex history. El Fout says it was the Ottoman Turks who really established herbal medicine here, from the 16th to the 18th centuries. He views his practice as part of Tunisia’s heritage. “Just as we have heritage in clothes and language, so we have herbal medicine. It is something we need to keep.” Yet with the rise of pharmaceutical medicine, these herbalists can appear artisanal. They also lack outside support. Being marginalised in this way is frustrating for herbal doctor Samir Ben Youssef, who inherited his father’s business and has treated patients in Souq El Blat for 20 years. Herbalist Samir Ben Youssef, who fears the trade will soon disappear “A hundred years ago, this whole road as far as the mosque [Al-Zaytuna] was lined with herboristes,” he says. “There was a whole chain of people who went to gather the herbs. But young people today don’t want to work in this trade any more. And the elders don’t want to pass on their knowledge. So it will disappear.” There are some younger herbalists, such as Yacine Ben Moussa, who is in his 30s and believes that modernity offers advantages. “Before I only worked with herbs that grow in Tunisia,” he says. “Now, with the internet, I can Google things and order foreign herbs online.” Among the shelves of plant medicines, which include cloves, anise and chia seeds, he shows me a framed certificate of phytotherapy from an academy of complementary medicine. Left: a stall crammed with traditional remedies; right: peacock feathers, hair colour and turtle carcasses for sale As Samir Ben Youssef intimated, however, the reputation of herb dealers may present a problem. They are associated with black magic. Many of the shops sell turtle carcasses as lucky charms. Some allegedly sell crushed iguana and hedgehog carcasses. One gave me a bag of cowrie shells and black nigella seeds to ward off the evil eye. Despite its secularism, spiritual belief still heavily influences Tunisian society. In medicine, while Tunisia has largely adopted western practices, the relationship between spirituality and healing lives on. This broader view of medicine – which herbalists span – has arguably helped to sustain a more holistic, intuitive approach to healing. Left: scents and beauty products on sale near the seventh-century Zaytuna mosque; right: a man outside the mosque As I leave the medina, taking in the smells of leather and jasmine perfume from a succession of shops, I pass the porticoed entrance of the seventh-century Zaytuna mosque. My head is alive with thoughts of the people once employed in gathering the plants and seeds from around the country to heal the sick. They would find wormwood, for diabetic ailments, among the craggy rocks of the southern Jebel Oust mountains. This is important: it reminds people that most medicine is essentially drawn from the living or organic world, a basic fact that may be lost to many consumers of western medication. This is not to discredit western medicine – its importance, for billions of people, is undeniable. But it is to remember that humbling, even sacred aspect of medicine: that much of what heals us can be found in nature.",Lifestyle/Travel,The herbalists of Tunis medina: on borrowed thyme – a photo essay,https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2022/feb/16/the-herbalists-of-tunis-medina-on-borrowed-thyme-a-photo-essay
2/16/2022,"I am chair of a voluntary organisation, Bromsgrove and Redditch Welcome Refugees. One of our Syrian refugees, brought here under the government’s “vulnerable persons relocation scheme” three years ago, has been let down by Ryanair. Last May he was accepted on a cabin crew training course with the airline, with support from Worcestershire county council. He had previously submitted his Home Office travel document and the council was assured when it checked it that it was valid. Eight months later, the day before the in-class training began, he was told in a two-line email that he was being “removed” from the course as he did not have a full UK passport. By then he had spent more than £1,000 on course requirements, completed the online training, and terminated his contract with his employer.  The passport issue should have been obvious when he submitted it in March 2021. Working as cabin crew had been his dream job as he builds a new life. This has been a severe setback and left him in debt. Ryanair has refused to refund him or the council any money, or even apologise.YR, Bromsgrove This is a painful case that could so easily have been avoided. The young Syrian and the council appear to have been confused about the legal status of a Home Office travel document, which looks similar to a UK passport, while the recruitment agency that signed him up has been woefully remiss. Ryanair cabin crew candidates are processed and trained by Crewlink, whose website states that applicants for UK jobs must have an “unrestricted right to live and work in the UK” and be in possession either of a UK passport or settled status. Your refugee has been granted leave to remain, which allows him to live and work in the UK for five years before becoming eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain. Settled status is only granted to EU nationals. It’s worrying, for all sorts of reasons, that Crewlink didn’t notice the permit he’d submitted wasn’t valid before signing him up. It appears the problem was spotted by a Ryanair employee at the end of October. Ryanair tells me he had confirmed he held a valid EU/UK passport in a virtual assessment in February 2021, but stated that his travel document was invalid for the job requirements. “Regrettably this anomaly was not identified until he started the first day of his training,” it says. “Crewlink should have clarified this issue much earlier.” Crewlink did not respond to requests for a comment. However, within four days of my contact, and three months after ejecting him, it has apologised and offered £240 in “goodwill”. The sum covers less than a quarter of his expenses, let alone the income lost from the supermarket job he gave up and the emotional fallout of the rejection. Worcestershire county council says it has been “liaising with the airline company to understand the reasons behind their decision”. Email your.problems@observer.co.uk.

2/16/2022,"A masterplan for a UK-wide traffic and barrier-free national cycling and walking network (NCN) suitable for “a sensible 12-year-old travelling alone” is to be launched on Wednesday. The ambitious plan would link most settlements of 10,000 people or more, and would make travel easier for wheelchair users, who can face multiple hurdles, while growing and improving the existing 12,786-mile network to reach all corners of the UK.  However, there are concerns that at the current rate of progress – Sustrans, the charity that manages the network, will complete 416 miles of improvements by 2023, and has removed just 315 of 16,000 barriers – the goal of a barrier-free network could take another 150 years. The charity owns only 2% of the network, much of which is on public roads, and its latest report into the state of the current NCN shows how far there is still to go. Only a third of the NCN is currently traffic-free. A third (33%) is classed by Sustrans as very poor, 61% good and only 2% very good. Xavier Brice, Sustrans’ CEO, told the Guardian: “The idea of the National Cycle Network isn’t to, for example, replace the need for fully segregated high-volume cycle lanes in cities and towns, or to replace the need for neighbourhoods that are pleasant and easy to move around without a car. This is a strategic arterial core network. “It’s about more than cycling. It’s about mobility scooters, wheelchairs, pushchairs, and in some places, horse riding as well.” Brice said the recent founding of Active Travel England, a non-executive body to deliver on the government’s walking and cycling goals, will mean more consistent funding, as well as enforcement of standards that don’t discriminate against disabled cyclists or wheelchair users. On average, 800 fences and chicanes need to be removed per year to meet a barrierless target of 2040. Brice said that while “in an ideal world, we’d just get the angle grinders and remove them all … people will often believe that they’re there for good reason”, such as to prevent off-road motorbikers illegally using the paths. “The fundamental point that we mustn’t lose sight of is: these barriers are discriminatory; they discriminate against wheelchairs, and mobility scooters and adapted trikes, people out with buggies, and therefore they need to go,” he said. The charity argues that by providing safe, accessible cycling, walking and horse-riding links the NCN can help the UK meet its physical activity, climate change and active travel targets. Usage grew by 19%, or 121m trips, in 2020 as people used green spaces for their daily exercise during the pandemic, with 6% of users in 2020 new or returning to cycling. This despite the fact Sustrans removed 3,733 miles, or a quarter of the network, in 2020 that no longer met the charity’s goals of “paths for everyone”. The masterplan map draws straight lines between settlements of 10,000 or more people, including reconnecting and improving missing sections. The next step, by June 2023, will be to set out a strategy for every mile of the network – including identifying new traffic-free sections and creating “quiet ways” on existing roads, with speed limits of 20mph in urban areas, 40mph in rural areas. This is using a process similar to one produced in identifying new London cycling routes. Sustrans calls the NCN a “national asset … on the doorstep of millions of people”, and wants it to be accessible to everyone.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Cycling charity launches ambitious plan to boost UK-wide path network,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/feb/16/cycling-charity-launches-ambitious-plan-to-boost-uk-wide-path-network
2/16/2022,"Lego is launching a £100m competition to find solutions that will make a positive impact on the lives of children in response to what the toymaker said was a “global early childhood emergency”. The Lego Foundation – the non-profit arm that owns 25% of the Danish company – is offering the 900m Danish kroner (£100m or $140m) prize fund to help children “in crisis” and address the loss of access to services and support, accelerated by the pandemic.  Between March 2020 and February 2021, 167 million children in 196 countries lost access to early childhood care and education services, according to the World Bank. The pandemic closed childcare and early education facilities, meaning caregivers took on the sole responsibility for meeting all their child’s developmental needs. “Parents struggling to keep a roof over their heads, stressed, working from home, perhaps managing more than one child, have understandably had less time,” said Prof Paul Ramchandani, a child psychiatrist and the leader of the University of Cambridge’s research into the role of play in child development. “But the most important thing for children’s healthy brain development is engagement with an adult,” says Ramchandani, “so we’re seeing that children’s social and emotional learning has stalled.” Two recent studies found that cognitive development in early childhood was declining, with babies born during the pandemic down 22 points in IQ, and the loss more pronounced for children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. “We’re living in a world where early childhood development is at crisis point,” said Anne-Birgitte Albrectsen, the CEO of the Lego Foundation. “It hasn’t had the investment or the political attention that it deserves. So to mark the Lego brand’s 90th anniversary, we’re making a statement.” Albrectsen hopes that the “Build a World of Play Challenge” fund will attract proposals addressing emergency issues as well as forward-looking projects. “It could be a tech innovation that will improve the health of families with young children, or a plan to make cities safer, greener, more sustainable, more playful; or ideas for reducing stress amongst caregivers; or help with equal access to education for girls, or for children with disabilities, or for neurodiverse children.” The Lego Foundation will assess each entry for impact, feasibility, sustainability and bearing on the community and plan to work closely with successful grantees. Five entries with ideas for the biggest impact will receive grants, with three receiving 200m DKK each (£22.6m) and two awarded 100m DKK each. In addition, the 10 finalists will receive 6.5m DKK each to strengthen their plans and build a team to implement their innovation. Less than 3% of all humanitarian aid is invested in education, with just a fraction of this in early education, said Sherrie Rollins Westin, the president of Sesame Workshop, the non-profit educational organisation behind Sesame Street. “We thought at first that children weren’t as vulnerable to Covid 19, at least in terms of the disease. But as time’s gone on, we’ve seen just how much the pandemic impacts children,” she said. “For a large proportion of the under-fives, it’s all they’ve ever known.” The Lego Foundation is already a significant investor in early childhood philanthropy, according to OECD reports, reaching 62 countries. So why not quietly continue? “Because this is a crisis,” said Albrectsen, “if we give money to the usual suspects, we won’t make such an impact.” Westin said the foundation’s new prize was “audacious philanthropy”. She added: “In the humanitarian space, the attention of Lego’s investment will attract other investment – highlighting the void, and creating an opportunity to make a real difference.”",News/Society,Lego offers £100m to find innovations tackling ‘global childhood crisis’ ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/feb/16/lego-offers-100m-to-find-innovations-tackling-global-childhood-crisis
2/16/2022,"Hello and welcome. I’m Warren Murray and this is the right place for you to be.  News of Prince Andrew’s settlement of the sex assault case filed against him by Virginia Giuffre has been met with silence by Buckingham Palace. The out-of-court settlement in the US civil case means the Duke of York makes no admission of guilt over claims by Giuffre that he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17 – allegations he has repeatedly denied. There has been no official comment from the Queen, who last month sought to distance the monarchy from the fallout when she stripped Prince Andrew of his royal patronages, honorary military titles and any official use of his HRH title. US attorneys representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein hailed the settlement. Giuffre’s lawyer had previously insisted she wanted the case heard in court and that she would be unlikely to accept a “purely financial settlement”. Andrew has now agreed to make a “substantial donation” to a charity supporting victims’ rights. He makes no admission of liability. In settlement documents submitted to a civil court in New York, Andrew commends Giuffre’s bravery and accepts that she “suffered as an established victim of abuse”. He said he regrets his association with Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in a jail cell after he was arrested for sex trafficking girls. The document states that Andrew will demonstrate this “by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims”. The text further outlines how Giuffre will dismiss the case once she receives the settlement. Starmer hits the road – Workers are entitled to ask for a pay rise considering the pandemic and cost-of-living crisis, Keir Starmer has said. The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, called this month for wage “restraint”, warning that rises would fuel inflation. Starmer has hit back: “It’s very difficult to universally say to people – you are not entitled to even ask for a pay rise,” he said. Official figures are expected to confirm on Wednesday an inflation rate of close to 5.4% in January – the highest level in three decades. In an interview with the Guardian, Starmer has said dozens of Conservative MPs contacted him expressing dismay at Boris Johnson’s false claim he had failed to prosecute the child abuser Jimmy Savile. Starmer said the public’s verdict on Johnson and “partygate” was likely to be the same whatever the Met’s conclusion. “There aren’t many members of the public that don’t think that Boris Johnson was involved in parties,” he said, accusing Johnson of wanting to “degrade the rules and drag everybody down with it”. It is recess in parliament and Starmer is spending most of it in the north of England and the Midlands: Sunderland, Burnley, Erdington.

The stage-managed manoeuvre unfolded on Tuesday as Putin claimed a “partial” withdrawal of Russian forces from the Ukrainian border – a claim that is being met with some expert scepticism. Putin has said he will not immediately recognise the two Russian-controlled so-called republics in Ukraine, but he is likely to wield that option as a bargaining chip as he continues to demand security guarantees from the west. Joe Biden has warned the American people he cannot “pretend this will be painless” for them if Russia invades Ukraine and they would feel it at the petrol pump.

Reweaving history – A monumental but fragile masterpiece depicting a 17th-century naval battle in silk and wool is the subject of an urgent crowdfunding appeal to complete its conservation. Royal Museums Greenwich needs to raise an extra £15,000 from the public in the next 28 days to save The Burning of the Royal James at the Battle of Solebay, 28 May 1672. The tapestry was commissioned by Charles II and designed by the father and son team Willem van de Velde the Elder and Younger. It depicts the Royal James engulfed in flames with tiny figures pitching themselves into the waves to escape the blazing ship. Cherubim battling with sea monsters decorate its borders. The first phase of conservation was completed last year in Belgium. It is now with specialist conservators in the UK. The appeal is being made through Art Happens with Art Fund, a crowdfunding platform for museums and galleries.

Glee’s Jane Lynch talks alcoholism, ambition and the return of Mrs Maisel. Pep Guardiola declared Manchester City’s 5-0 demolition of Sporting the “dream result” but insisted his team can play even better after they emphatically put one foot into the Champions League quarter-finals. It was not so positive for the Portuguese champions, who were outclassed in their first Champions League knockout match since 2009. Suddenly there was Kylian Mbappé once again. With 45 seconds left, just when it looked as if victory had evaded a Paris Saint-Germain side that could have won this match against Real Madrid a lot earlier and three times over, he delivered the solution that they had sought all night. After 588 minutes of football and 47 days, the great drought is over. Cristiano Ronaldo, the scorer of more goals than anyone in the history of football, scored a goal, his first of 2022 and his first as a 37‑year‑old. It came against Brighton, and in the process a serial Champions League winner put Manchester United in the position to return to the European elite. In Beijing, at the halfway stage of the women’s Winter Olympics single skating competition, Kamila Valieva leads and goes into Thursday’s free skating programme as a huge favourite for gold. The tragedy for her is that her positive test for a banned substance means the chances of an Olympic medal around her neck hang increasingly by a sequin’s thread.
