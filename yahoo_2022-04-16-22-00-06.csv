4/16/2022,"Jennifer Abruzzo is the general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board, a key labor law role. One of her big initiatives is targeting companies that make employees sit through anti-union meetings. She's also pushing for doctrine that would make it easier for workers to join a union. Jennifer Abruzzo is quietly shaking up the state of labor in America. Abruzzo is the general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). She's the first woman to hold the role, occupying a key perch for guiding labor law in the country and how it's enacted. Her appointment marked one of President Joe Biden's first actions in his quest to be the ""most pro-union President leading the most pro-union administration in American history."" According to Bloomberg Law, mere minutes after he was sworn in, Biden dismissed former Trump-appointed general counsel Peter Robb. It was a rare move, since incoming presidents usually let predecessors' appointees finish out their terms, as The Washington Post reports, and one that pro-worker labor groups immediately heralded. Biden ended up tapping Abruzzo, an NLRB veteran who was serving as counsel for the Communication Workers of America. ""Since I've gotten back in July, there's been a lot of things on my mind in terms of what we should tackle, whether it be Trump board precedent — with which I completely disagree,"" Abruzzo told Insider. Her goal, she said, is ""to protect, enforce, and educate."" And she's doing so one memo at a time. Her latest target: Captive audience meetings. Right now, as workers across the country try to unionize, many of them might end up in mandatory anti-union meetings hosted by management. Those are called ""captive audience"" meetings, and they're popular among bosses. According to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute, from 1999 to 2003, nearly 90% of employers facing union drives had workers attend captive audience meetings — and the majority of them held them weekly during union campaigns. ""Workers are typically subject to a significant number of captive audiences,"" Abruzzo said. Even if employers don't make illegal statements during the meetings, ""it does have a coercive impact."" ""Workers don't feel that they can leave, even though they have the right to refrain from listening to speech — just as much as they have the right to listen to it — because of the very real fear of retaliation,"" Abruzzo said. For instance, David Isiah Thomas, an Amazon worker in Bessemer, Alabama, filed complaints with the NLRB saying that after Thomas questioned a manager during a captive audience meeting, he ""observed the employer's agent circling his work area for no other purpose than to watch him."" But that could all change soon. In a memo to NLRB directors and officers, Abruzzo said she was going to ""urge the Board to reconsider such precedent and find mandatory meetings of this sort unlawful."" It would be a seismic shift for a commonly-employed tactic, and one that workers at Starbucks and Amazon have said they've attended. Insider's Katherine Long reported that some workers at the Bessmer, Alabama-based Amazon warehouse were swayed against the union after captive audience meetings and anti-union texts. Workers can be disciplined or discharged if they don't show up to captive audience meetings, or leave early. Abruzzo said that ""safeguards"" can be established by assuring that attendance is voluntary, and that workers won't have any action taken against them for refraining. The EPI report found that discharges for union activity have risen. ""What we really are trying to do is prevent that implicit threat, if not explicit, and the fear that it inspires on these economically dependent employees, which I consider to be the epitome of coercion,"" Abruzzo said. There's already pushback from business: Sean Redmond, the vice president for labor policy at the right-leaning US Chamber of Commerce, wrote that if Abruzzo's proposal was accepted, ""it would deliberately muzzle employers"" and ""impede free speech."" On Monday, according to a Twitter thread from Abruzzo's office, she submitted a brief urging the board to reinstate the Joy Silk doctrine. That's an older standard that essentially says if workers have formed a union — and that the majority of them support it — employers should have to bargain with them, unless they ""good faith doubt"" that the majority of workers are onboard. Currently, employers can opt to either voluntarily recognize their workers' union, or compel them to vote in a formal NLRB election. In essence, as Fast Company reports, it would make it a lot easier for workers to join a union — something that contrasts with continually declining union membership, even as approval for unions reaches 68%, according to Gallup. That's all happening as the NLRB comes up against budget constraints amid a wave of interest in unions. The agency said it saw the number of union representation petitions skyrocket by 57% from October to March, as well as the number of unfair labor practice charges. But its budget has remained the same for the last nine years, and staffing has shrunk by 39% in the last decade. Field agents, who are on the frontlines of the NLRB's work, have seen their staff shrink by half. ""During my predecessor's time, there was very little, if any, backfilling,"" Abruzzo said, adding: ""We definitely need a budget in order to get more employees, particularly in the field."" At the end of the day, ""we are all about encouraging collective bargaining,"" Abruzzo said. ""That is our Congressional mandate: To encourage collective bargaining, to promote industrial stability and productive labor management relations, to protect workers' rights to freely associate, and to engage in other activity to improve their lot in life,"" she said. ""So that's what we are all about.""

4/16/2022,"Fox News's Sean Hannity asked Donald Trump if Russia's actions in Ukraine were ""evil."" Trump replied by criticizing NATO, which he described as a ""paper tiger."" The former president has long expressed admiration for Vladimir Putin and avoided direct criticisms of him. Former President Donald Trump criticized NATO when asked about Russia's ""evil"" actions in Ukraine. In an interview with the former president on Wednesday, Fox News host Sean Hannity asked him about ""war crimes and atrocities"" being committed by Russia ""from Bucha to Mariupol."" ""We have mass graves. We have innocent civilians being slaughtered in the streets. We have entire neighborhoods leveled,"" Hannity said. ""Do you believe this is evil in our time?"" Trump avoided directly answering the question and instead criticized NATO. ""I think in 100 years, people are going to look back, and they're going to say how did we stand back, and NATO stand back, which in many ways I've called a paper tiger,"" Trump said. —Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) April 14, 2022 The former president claimed he ""rebuilt NATO"" and criticized member states at length for not spending as much as the US. During his time in office, Trump repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the alliance and pressured other member states to increase defense spending. In the interview with Fox, Trump also repeated his claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if he was still president. ""When I look at what's happening, it never would have happened under the Trump administration,"" Trump said. ""I knew Putin very well, almost as well as I know you, Sean,"" Trump told his long-time friend Hannity. ""I will tell you. We talked about it. We talked about it a lot. He did want Ukraine, but I said you're not going into Ukraine."" In the interview, Trump did refer to Russia's actions in Ukraine as ""genocide,"" echoing language used by President Joe Biden. However, he stopped short of directly criticizing Putin or characterizing Russia's actions as evil. It is not the first time Hannity has directly asked the former president to describe Putin and Russia's actions as ""evil."" In a March 10 interview, just weeks after the invasion of Ukraine, Hannity asked Trump: ""I think you also recognize that [Putin] is evil, do you not?"" Trump again avoided answering, replying: ""This doesn't seem to be the same Putin that I was dealing with."" The former president has long expressed admiration for Putin, often describing the Russian president as ""smart"" and praising his war strategy as ""genius"" in the early days of the invasion. He has regularly criticized NATO and US allies while boasting about his good relationships with authoritarian leaders such as Putin. On Thursday, MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell commented that Trump appears to not have the ""moral clarity"" of Sean Hannity, in rare praise of the Fox News host. ""Donald Trump said nothing. He said a couple of hundred words that included NATO, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, NATO becoming rich, he said something really insulting about Chuck Todd—but he did not dare to say one insulting word about Vladimir Putin,"" O'Donnell said.

4/16/2022,"By David Morgan and Doina Chiacu WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The Republican National Committee voted unanimously on Thursday to withdraw from the Commission on Presidential Debates, saying the group that has run the debates for decades was biased and refused to enact reforms. ""We are going to find newer, better debate platforms to ensure that future nominees are not forced to go through the biased CPD in order to make their case to the American people,"" the committee's chairperson, Ronna McDaniel, said in a statement. The RNC's action requires Republican candidates to agree in writing to appear only in primary and general election debates sanctioned by the committee. The nonprofit commission, founded in 1987 to codify the debates as a permanent part of presidential elections, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It was unclear what format future RNC-backed debates would take or whether they would take place as often as in recent decades. The move, which followed months of wrangling between the RNC and the commission, will potentially deprive voters of seeing Republican and Democratic candidates on the same stage. Millions of Americans usually watch the presidential debates, and many viewers say they help them make up their minds about whom to vote for, according to research by the Pew Research Center. The Democratic National Committee, the RNC's counterpart for President Joe Biden's party, accused Republicans of trying to hide from voters. ""Voters can count on hearing from President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris, who are proud of their records,"" DNC chairperson Jaime Harrison said in a statement. The RNC's decision follows grievances aired by former President Donald Trump and other Republicans about the timing of debates, debate formats and the selection of moderators. Defenders of the debates say they are an important element of the democratic process, but critics say they have become television spectacles in which viewers learn little about the candidates' policies. Trump refused to participate in what was supposed to be the second of three debates with Biden in 2020, after the commission switched it to a virtual contest following Trump's COVID-19 infection. The RNC said the commission ""refused to enact simple and commonsense reforms.""

4/16/2022,"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams cannot immediately begin raising and spending unlimited campaign contributions under a state law passed last year because she is not yet her party's nominee, a federal judge ruled Thursday. Abrams and her One Georgia committee filed a lawsuit last month challenging the constitutionality of the new law, which allows certain top elected officials and party nominees to create “leadership committees” that can raise campaign funds without limits. But they also asked the judge to order the state ethics commission not to take any action against them if they continue to raise money before the primary next month. “This Court will not rewrite Georgia law to enable One Georgia to stand in the same shoes as a leadership committee that, in Plaintiffs' view, is operating in violation of the First Amendment,” U.S. District Judge Mark Cohen wrote in his order. Abrams' campaign manager Lauren Groh-Wargo said after the ruling that it's even more important now for supporters to donate directly to the campaign. The law allows the governor and lieutenant governor, opposing major party nominees, and both party caucuses in the state House and Senate to form leadership committees. Unlike traditional political action committees, they are allowed to coordinate with a candidate's campaign. Leadership committees can also collect unlimited contributions, while candidates for statewide office cannot collect more than $7,600 from an individual donor for a primary or general election and $4,500 for a runoff election. The lawsuit noted that the new law allows Republican Gov. Brian Kemp to raise unlimited funds while Abrams is constrained by the contribution limits. Abrams is the only Democrat who qualified to run for governor, which means she is effectively the party's nominee, her lawyers argued. State party chair U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams submitted a sworn statement saying that Abrams is the party's nominee. But state law is unambiguous in requiring a candidate to be selected in a primary election to be considered the nominee, Cohen wrote. Georgia's primary election is set for May 24. Abrams and her committee could have followed the path chosen earlier this year by former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, who is challenging Kemp in the Republican primary. Perdue sought to stop Kemp's leadership committee Georgians First from soliciting or receiving contributions and to stop it from spending money to promote his reelection. Cohen ruled in February that Kemp could not spend any more money from the committee on his primary campaign. But he said the committee could continue to receive contributions and spend money in support of other public officials in accordance with campaign finance laws. Kemp has appealed the ruling. Cohen wrote that Abrams and her committee chose an “untenable option” by asking to be allowed to raise unlimited funds under a law that they contend is unconstitutional. He also rejected the attempt to prevent a Georgia state agency from enforcing a law that says a nominee for governor is chosen in a primary. Cohen's ruling was not a surprise. He was clearly skeptical of Abrams' requests at a hearing earlier this week.",Politics/Associated Press,Judge denies Abrams bid to seek unlimited contributions,https://news.yahoo.com/judge-denies-abrams-bid-seek-222538921.html
