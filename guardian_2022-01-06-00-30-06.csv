1/6/2022,"Italy is returning a fragment belonging to the Parthenon’s eastern frieze to Greece in a breakthrough deal that could renew pressure on Britain to repatriate the 2,500-year-old Parthenon marbles removed by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century. The marble fragment, which depicts the foot of a goddess, either Peitho or Artemis, peeking out from beneath an elaborate tunic, is currently held at the Antonino Salinas Regional Archaeological Museum in Palermo, Sicily. It was originally bought by the University of Palermo from the widow of Robert Fagan, the British consul for Sicily and Malta, after his death in 1816.  The artefact is being returned on a four-year loan as part of a cultural exchange agreement between Sicily and Greece, with the intention for the loan period to be extended by a further four years. However, the move back to Greece could eventually become permanent. In return, the Acropolis Museum in Athens will loan the Palermo museum a 5th-century BC headless statue of the goddess Athena, as well as an 8th-century BC amphora. The deal, which includes an exchange of cultural initiatives between the two museums, comes after several years of negotiations between Sicilian and Greek authorities. “Sending back to the context of its origins a small, but significant, fragment belonging to the Parthenon has a very strong symbolic value,” said Sicily’s culture chief, Alberto Samonà. “It is also a response to the international debate [about the Parthenon artefacts]. But I don’t want to get into that debate. For us, this is a gesture of friendship – Greece and Sicily are two areas of the Mediterranean that share a common story.” The fragment was loaned to Greece in 2002 and in 2008. Samonà said the latest transfer could become permanent, but that it would be up to the Italian culture ministry to take the measures needed to make that happen. It is not known how Fagan, an amateur archaeologist, acquired the fragment, although one theory suggests it might have been given to him by Elgin, the British aristocrat who excavated the bulk of the ancient Parthenon marbles between 1801 and 1804 before selling them to the British Museum in 1816, where the artefacts are currently on display. Greece has long fought for the marbles to be repatriated from the UK. In November, the Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, demanded that Britain return the marbles to Greece, while at the same time offering to loan some Greek historical treasures to the British Museum. In response, Downing Street said returning the marbles was a matter for the British Museum. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, had previously said the marbles would remain in Britain, arguing that they were legally acquired.",Arts/Art and design,Italy returns Parthenon fragment to Greece amid UK row over marbles ,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/jan/05/italy-returns-parthenon-marbles-fragment-greece-uk-row
1/6/2022,"It is perhaps the biggest American star to visit Preston in years. A “spectacular” shaggy-crested belted kingfisher has drawn several thousand people to a nature reserve in Lancashire for one of the bird’s few recorded UK sightings in more than 100 years. The North American bird usually migrates to Mexico or the Caribbean for winter but is thought to have ended up in Preston after getting blown across the ocean by an Atlantic storm.  Nick Moran, of the British Trust for Ornithology, said it was only the fifth recorded sighting of a belted kingfisher in the UK since 1908 – and the first “truly twitchable” one in years because of the length of its stay. The striking-looking bird was first spotted in October but has drawn interest from birdwatchers across the country after seemingly taking up residence at Brockholes nature reserve in Preston. George Shannon, who recorded one of its earliest sightings, said he was blown away when the belted kingfisher landed in front of him: “I got my binoculars on it and genuinely couldn’t believe the image I was seeing. I thought ‘it’s a belted kingfisher but it can’t possibly be a belted kingfisher’. My heart was pounding out of my chest.” It is only the second time since 1908 that a belted kingfisher has been recorded in the UK outside Cornwall or the Isles of Scilly, where they usually make landfall. Tony Baker, a local site manager at the RSPB, said he went to see the bird before Christmas along with 300 to 400 keen birdwatchers – but estimates it will have been seen by “several thousand” people by now. “A lot of birdwatchers become very interested in chasing rarities and adding new species to their life lists and this is one of those that turns up very, very rarely so it generates an enormous amount of excitement,” he said. “Apart from the fact it’s very rare, it’s also a fairly spectacular species that everybody can appreciate. It’s a terrific thing to see.”",News/Environment,Rare kingfisher sighting in Preston draws thousands,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/05/rare-kingfisher-sighting-in-preston-draws-thousands
1/6/2022,"Aston Villa want to sign Philippe Coutinho on loan from Barcelona and have contacted the Brazilian’s agent with a view to negotiating a deal. Coutinho is ready to leave the Camp Nou and Villa are understood to be one of three Premier League suitors. The 29-year-old joined Barcelona from Liverpool for an initial £106m in January 2018 but the move has not worked out and he spent the 2019-20 season on loan at Bayern Munich.  Coutinho, who can operate as a wide player or attacking midfielder, has started only five games this season, the most recent of those a month ago. He tested positive for Covid last week but was said by Barcelona to be in good health. The Brazil international had a highly successful five and a half seasons in the Premier League with Liverpool and Villa believe they could get him to spark again. Barcelona have made attempts to sell him since summer 2019 without finding a buyer. Steven Gerrard, a teammate of Coutinho while the pair were at Liverpool, is expected to be backed in his first transfer window in charge of Villa.

1/6/2022,"If you find news websites too overwhelming, too fast and too full of distractions then this might be the solution: a recreation of the BBC’s Ceefax service featuring up-to-date headlines, an accurate weather map and the latest stock market prices. Nathan Dane, 20, has spent the last six years building a simulation of the BBC’s defunct text-based information service. It takes in data from the BBC’s existing website and repurposes it in the distinctively blocky font that was ubiquitous on television sets during the 1980s and 1990s.  “It’s as close a recreation as I can make it,” said Dane from his home in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, where he has a separate screen at his desk for showing news headlines from his recreation of Ceefax. “I do find it really useful myself. If I’m sitting in work eating my lunch I can just stick that on and get up to date. You’re not flicking about between websites – you have all the information you need on a page but without all the distraction.” At its peak, tens of millions of Britons used BBC Ceefax and its commercial equivalent, Teletext, to check news headlines, find travel information or wait an infuriatingly long time for a quiz answer to be revealed. Individual stories were often split across multiple pages, meaning it could take minutes to fully comprehend an article if you were unlucky enough to load halfway through a piece. Only a few sentences of text fitted on each screen, forcing writers to develop the skills to produce concise stories. But the limitations and slowness of a system designed in 1974 may be increasingly attractive in a world of unlimited choice, while the cluttered advertising-heavy designs of many modern websites have made people nostalgic for the simplicity of Ceefax. The BBC closed the original Ceefax service as part of the transition to digital television broadcasts, with Northern Ireland being the last region of the UK to lose access. “We had Ceefax in this part of the world until 2012, which is probably the only reason I remember it,” said Dane, who works for a digital signage company. “I have a great interest in all the old broadcast-TV type stuff. It’s really the service that I remember looking through when I was wee.” Dane’s recreation features a weather map (page 401) based on data from the Met Office that accurately recreates the current forecast on a map of the UK using the limited Ceefax colour palette. The Premier League football table (page 324) is up to date. A selection of national, foreign and local stories can be accessed through the headlines section (page 101). Some fans have also set up YouTube streams looping through Ceefax pages with muzak in the background, recreating the way the BBC used to fill overnight schedules on its channels. The small but thriving online Teletext community, which is centred on a group on the chat service Discord, already helps run a separate long-running service called Teefax – although it does not use the same BBC styling. There are also dozens of teletext artists who challenge themselves to use the limited colour palette. One of them, Dan Farriond, said: “It’s a great gateway because it’s very simple, it’s built on 1970s technology, it’s simple to get your head around technology-wise. It’s the pure aesthetic of it and the simplicity. You only have a limited number of colours. A lot of the design decisions are made for you.” Dane, who runs his Ceefax server from his home, said his service was remarkably stable. When Facebook went offline in November he proudly tweeted a story about Mark Zuckerberg’s company with the caption: “Ceefax, however, remains unaffected.”",News/Media,Text appeal: Ceefax recreated by 20-year-old Northern Irish man,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/05/text-appeal-ceefax-recreated-by-20-year-old-northern-irish-man
1/6/2022,"In the 1970s I lived in SoHo in New York, which is not far from the Bowery, but the two districts were like separate universes. SoHo was full of artists and creative types but the Bowery was known as the place where you ended up when you were at the bottom of the barrel. There were a lot of flophouses and a lot of alcoholism and drug use. It was the darkest place in New York City for a long time. The Bowery Mission is a Christian rescue centre for homeless people. Only men are allowed to stay overnight but it feeds anybody. I used to go there around Thanksgiving and Christmas time to help serve dinner. The face-to-face contact and interactions I had with people meant that I always felt a real connection with them, and it also made me grateful for what I had in my own life.  In the 1990s there was a lot of focus on homelessness in New York City and money and public attention were put towards trying to end it. And then, in the early 2000s, the interest faded. It’s not that the problem went away – on the contrary – but for some reason we weren’t talking about it any more. That bothered me, so I thought to myself: what can I do? I figured as a photographer I could create something that brings a little attention to these people and their situation. So I contacted the Bowery Mission and asked to do some portraits of the centre’s regular users. They gave me a room upstairs to work in. If you want to get a meal at the Bowery Mission, you have to also attend a religious service. So I’d wait until people had eaten and listened to the sermon and were chilled out and relaxed and only then would I approach to ask if I could photograph them. I needed to be very careful because in a lot of ways these people are very fragile, but I was also surprised by how much – had I not known they were homeless – I would have never guessed their circumstances. My plan was to focus on faces and eyes, because we so often walk down the street and see somebody and we don’t want to actually look at them or engage. Not to sound corny but I was interested in trying to get into their story and their soul. I was interested when couples arrived at the centre as it was clear that they lived together on the streets. These guys were such a great pair. When they smiled, I was like: that’s the picture. I shot with something called an Octabank, which is like a gigantic umbrella that’s about six feet wide and means that the whole face is beautifully lit. It’s more often used in fashion photography. A lot of pictures of homeless people are really sad. I didn’t want to do that. There is some joy in these people, and that’s what I wanted to show. That’s why I lit it the way I did. And from the poses I wanted to get the depth of feeling of them as humans but I also wanted to get over the fact that you would hang with some of these people – they’re cool! I choose deliberately not to publish their names out of consideration for their privacy and because I wanted to focus on the faces and humanity of the people captured in the moment in the project. With these two it was clear that they had each other, and that was pretty much it in their lives at that point. I wanted to give a sense of what their relationship felt like. I was trying to get them to centre themselves in front of the camera, and just be who they were and not try to do anything special or performative. Many of us are only a couple of steps away from something like homelessness. I was feeling helpless about a situation in my city that I thought was terrible and a life condition I saw every day when I walked out of my door. The worse the situation becomes the more it is normalised and your sense of helplessness is eventually numbed. I exhibited the work in the Mission headquarters in Midtown. We blew up eight or nine of the photographs to around 6ft by 4ft. You’re looking at these huge eyes and faces and the impact of having all those pictures in one room was pretty overwhelming. I think they felt really special having all the lights and cameras and attention on them when doing this project. I hope that feeling lasted for a while.

1/6/2022,"One in 15 people in England had Covid last week, rising to one in 10 in London, official figures have revealed. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, an estimated 3,270,800 people in England, or about 6% of the population on average, had Covid in the week ending 31 December. The week before the figure was about one in 25, or 4% of the population on average.  Infection levels also rose in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the most recent week, with the latest estimates suggesting that about one in 20 in the former two countries had Covid in the week ending 31 December, and about one in 25 for the latter. In the week before the figure was about one in 40 for all three countries. For all countries in the UK, Omicron is now the dominant coronavirus variant. The results reveal infection levels in England differ by age and region although they have risen across the board: levels were highest in those aged from school year 12 to 24 years old, at about one in 10 people in this age group. However, levels were almost as high in other age groups including those aged two to school year 6 and those aged 25 to 34 where about one in 15 were estimated to have had Covid in the most recent week. By contrast the figure was about one in 45 for those aged 70 and over. In terms of regions in England, London had the highest infection levels, with about one in 10 estimated to have had Covid in the most recent week. However the team note there are hints the situation may be shifting. “In the last few days of 2021, the trend in the percentage testing positive was uncertain for those in London who are secondary school ages and those aged 25 to 49 years, which may mean that infections are no longer increasing among these ages in London, but it is currently too early to suggest if this is a continuing change in trend,” the team write. The lowest levels of infection were found in the south-west, where one in 30 are estimated to have had Covid in the week ending 31 December. “We continue to see infections across the UK increase, with Omicron now the dominant variant across all four nations,” said Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey. “There are early signs of a potential slowing of infections in London in the days before New Year’s Eve. However, it is too early to suggest this is a change in trend overall.”",News/World news,"One in 15 people in England had Covid last week, ONS data shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/covid-england-ons-data-one-in-15-infected
1/6/2022,"Nicola Sturgeon has cut Scotland’s self-isolation period from 10 to seven days, after sustained pressure from businesses and opposition parties to address soaring staff absences. The first minister has softened her government’s highly cautious stance on the 10-day isolation period after data from hospitals suggested the Omicron variant was less medically severe than feared.  Sturgeon also confirmed Scotland would adopt a new rule on taking PCR tests announced in England earlier on Wednesday, to cut the number of PCR tests being taken unnecessarily and conserve supplies. She said the requirement for someone with a positive lateral flow test to immediately book a PCR would be dropped, as long as they did not have symptoms. That new rule will come into force on Thursday 6 January, rather than 11 January as in England. Ministers in England and in Wales cut self-isolation to a week in December after deciding the impact of extended self-isolation on public services and businesses was not outweighed by Omicron’s risk to health and critical care services. In a recalled session of the Scottish parliament, Sturgeon told MSPs people could end their self-isolation after seven days if they had no fever and had had two negative lateral flow tests. Close contacts will not be expected to self-isolate if they are fully vaccinated, have no symptoms and record negative tests every day for seven days, under the new rules, which take effect from midnight on Wednesday. She acknowledged the new rules were “more proportionate and sustainable and less restrictive”. Sturgeon’s move came after Scottish hospitals said their services were under significant strain because of staff absences. ScotRail, the main rail operator, cut hundreds of trains this month and began operating a reduced timetable owing to staff shortages. Hospitality companies and retailers have struggled to stay open, and complained bitterly about the impact on their businesses. While Scotland has recorded its highest-ever Covid infections – 20,217 on Monday, a figure partly inflated by results delayed by the holiday weekend – rates of critical illness have remained stable. There were 1,223 people with Covid in hospital on Wednesday, more than double the number seven days ago, but the number in intensive care has remained stable, at about 52 or 53 people a day. Ministers have not stated whether these patients were in hospital because of Covid or were found to be Covid-positive after admission, or for another reason. Sturgeon told MSPs that five more people had died after a positive Covid test, taking the total number of deaths under that measure in Scotland to 9,872. The latest Office for National Statistics survey data suggested that one in 20 Scots had had Omicron last week, a figure similar to the rates in many English regions. The rate before Christmas was one in 40. “The proportion of people with Covid is likely to be even higher than that now, a few days later – and I would anticipate that we will see continued growth in the level of infection as work and school resume after the holiday period,” Sturgeon said. “In short, Covid is significantly more widespread now than at any stage in the pandemic so far, and will almost certainly become even more so in days to come. This, of course, has extremely serious implications for the NHS and social care. But it also has a severe and increasing impact on the economy and other critical services.”",News/UK news,Scotland cuts Covid self-isolation period from 10 to seven days,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/05/scotland-cuts-covid-self-isolation-period-from-10-to-seven-days
