5/19/2022,"Regional communities are concerned they will have to travel for hours to cast their vote on Saturday, as the Australian Electoral Commission makes a last-ditch effort to fill staffing gaps so polling places can open. The administration of this year’s election has been hampered by labour shortages, which have been compounded by further staffing shortages due to Covid, with 90 workers calling in sick with the virus within 24 hours in Hobart. The AEC said in the past day more than 5,000 people had signed up to work on polling day in the electorates in Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland that were facing staff shortages. “The new registrations mean some of the locations we identified yesterday are no longer of critical concern but others are still falling short and, given the current environment, there could be new areas of concern arise,” digital engagement director at AEC Evan Ekin-Smyth said. “However, the impact will be limited. We will have the absolute vast majority of the 7,000 polling places we operate across the nation on election day open and operating as per usual.” The AEC said it was doing everything it could to ensure every polling place was staffed on Saturday, including approaching the Australian defence force to enlist the help of the reserves, police and emergency services personnel. There has been a last-minute callout for workers over social media and public servants are being urged to help out, with rules around holding another job waived so they can take part. It was expected that 76 booths across regional and remote Australia would not open on Saturday, although that number has become unclear. The key seats of concern were: Capricornia, Flynn, Kennedy and Leichhardt in Queensland, Barker and Grey in SA, and Durack and O’Connor in WA. In some of those electorates, community members were racing to find their own staff to work. Dianne Const and her husband run the roadhouse in King Lake, a small farming town in the eastern region of WA. When she heard that the polling booth might not open this week, she put her hand up. “There’s another lady working – she’s going to be at Newdegate, at Lake Magenta and King Lake – but she can’t be in three places at once. I said if you need someone, let me know and I’ll come and help,” Const said. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “I’m happy to be able to do it for them.” Const has been in contact with another community member, trying to organise for her to work with them. They need one more to open, and they are “not 100% sure” if they will get there. She said the town would have about 100 voters, and if the polling booth doesn’t open in King Lake, everyone will have to drive 50 minutes to the next one. “This is what happens in the bush and with Covid it’s worse. It’s been a huge problem,” Const said. Over in South Australia, Cass Munro runs the Lyrup general store. With a population of about 500, Munro said the community would be “disappointed” if the booth didn’t open. “When you’re running a business, it’ll take 30 mins travel time, then you have to line up and vote and get ticked off,” she said. “It could be an hour-long journey, and there’ll be more congestion because the outlying areas will all be going in.” Munro said the town’s oldest resident, a 96-year-old man, had been into the store that morning talking about it, concerned about taking the drive. “It’s a bit disappointing. I can see the place right now. Last time we voted for state election it took me 13 minutes to walk down, vote and walk back,” Munro said. Liberal MP for Capricornia Michelle Landry said it was “extremely disappointing” that some booths in her electorate might be closed and that she was especially concerned for elderly residents. “This will mean that residents in these communities may have to travel over an hour to their nearest polling booth,” Landry said. There are also concerns that Indigenous communities will be affected by the closures. The First Nations campaign director at GetUp, Amy Gordon, said it would amount “to voter suppression”. “The affected electorates have the highest Aboriginal votes in the country, and plans should have been in place to make sure their polling booths were fully staffed,” Gordon said. “Our local volunteers on the ground in the Cape York peninsula this week have seen how people really want to have a say on issues like remote housing, health in communities and cultural heritage.” The AEC said the vast majority of the nation’s planned 7,000 polling places will be open. “People are taking advantage of the options the Australian election system makes available – pre-poll, postal, remote mobile votes, couriered overseas votes, in-person overseas votes and even telephone voting are all being utilised by those eligible to do so,” Ekin-Smyth said. “For those areas of concern, people are putting their hand up to help deliver democracy in their community, which is great, but we need more.”",News/Australia news,Some voters in regional Australia could face hours-long drives to cast their federal election vote,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/some-voters-in-regional-australia-could-face-hours-long-drives-to-cast-their-federal-election-vote
5/19/2022,"There are plenty of people who say they can tell you what makes the All Blacks great. New Zealand’s rugby team support a cottage industry of articles, books, seminars and podcasts explaining their success. Exactly how their cricket side got to be the best in the world, though, when they have a smaller budget and player base than almost any other Test-playing nation, is a harder question to answer. Not least because so many of the people who were involved along the way seem so reluctant to talk about it at any length. So the England and Wales Cricket Board, and its new managing director, Rob Key, brought in Brendon McCullum to let them in on the secret. On Wednesday Key explained that “the biggest thing” McCullum had going for him when they decided to make him England’s new Test coach was “the fact that he’s done this with New Zealand”, adding: “He was the catalyst for the change in New Zealand cricket, and it made him someone that was just so attractive in that position.” Whenever anyone does map out the story of New Zealand’s route to the World Test Championship, they usually start with McCullum and the meeting he held with Mike Hesson and a couple of other coaches after the team were bowled out for 45 in his first game in charge, at Cape Town in 2013. McCullum later described it as “ground zero”. They spoke about the players they wanted to pick, the staff they wanted to hire and the way they wanted to play, which, they agreed, was radically different from how they had been going about it. So they, and the rest of the team, came up with a list of principles they wanted to live by. You still hear Kane Williamson talking about them today. He describes them as “simple values which are important to our group and to all Kiwis, and which we want to commit to day-in day-out”. McCullum is not going to be able to do exactly that for England; he will need Ben Stokes to define the team’s identity in the same way he did for New Zealand, but you can be sure some of the traits will be pretty similar. “Brendon’s pretty clear,” Key said. “He wants batsmen whose default position is to look to score runs, who can transfer pressure back on to the bowler when needed, but who also have the fortitude and temperament to be able to soak up pressure when that’s required, too. “Bowlers who can look to take wickets and are prepared to change their plans to make sure they get each batsman out. And fielders who chase the ball hard to the boundary each time. And that’s it. That’s the philosophy we think will turn us into a winning Test match team.” “The bet”, as Key calls it, is that this way of thinking is going to get more out of the same group of players who struggled in the past couple of years. Which is one reason why this first Test squad feels so familiar and so much of it (injuries and one or two famous old bowlers aside) is so similar to the one they picked in the West Indies. “I said at the start of my first press conference that I think there are some seriously talented cricketers in this country, and we just need to unlock them and get them playing to the best of their ability,” Key said. “I’m backing Brendon and Ben to have a clear vision for the way we want to play to do that.” Eventually, Key said, every red-ball player in England will have a clear idea of how the Test team are going to play. “We’re going to try and get that through right the way down the system so people understand what’s required.” He compares it with what happened in white-ball cricket. “It’s not really about the 11 players, it’s about the philosophy and the way they play. It’s a little bit of what we want in Test cricket, not in terms of playing shots, but in that it’s so clear how they want to go about playing cricket and that has filtered down through our system into county cricket, so there’s a whole production line of batsmen coming through that play in that style.” There is a lot to like in all this, even if you think Dom Sibley, or Rory Burns, might be a better bet as an opener, that Matt Parkinson should have been picked instead of Jack Leach, or that it’s asking too much of Ollie Pope to make him bat at No 3. There’s an appealing simplicity to Key’s idea that if you start with the right coach and captain then everything else will follow. And given the men he has picked it would not be surprising if there was an uptick in the team’s results. Beyond that, though, there has to be a caveat. There are bigger, and more complicated, problems in English cricket than can be fixed by any of this. Good as the McCullum story is, there was, unsurprisingly, a lot more to what happened in New Zealand than what was agreed in that team meeting. Like the way they overhauled their domestic pay structure, the close links between NZC and their six first-class districts, the work they did to relay their domestic pitches back at the start of the last decade. The ECB has an opportunity to address some of its own structural issues in its ongoing reviews into red‑ball cricket, racism in the game and the wider culture of the sport. In the long term, a lot more will depend on whether it can get decisions right, too.",Sport/Sport,McCullum brings appealing simplicity but English cricket has structural problems | Andy Bull,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2022/may/19/brendon-mccullum-england-cricket
5/19/2022,"We were disappointed to read remarks made by Amir Khan this week. The boxing great chose the moment of his retirement to take a swipe at young British Asians in sport – and footballers in particular. He said they give up too easy and fall back on “excuses”. He said their diet is “appalling” and made up mainly of curries. Perhaps these were throwaway comments, but they perpetuate a myth and they need to be addressed. We work together as part of the Asian Inclusion Scheme (Aims) at the Professional Footballers’ Association. One of us is a lawyer, the other a former player and coach, but we both love football and want to see more players of South Asian heritage in the game. We also see every week the commitment young players and their parents are putting into making that a reality. At a recent Aims event at St George’s Park we had 100 young elite players and 200 parents stay a night away from home in order to raise awareness of what it might take to make the grade. These are players who spend all their free time training and parents who will drive the length and breadth of the country to support that. Nobody here is making excuses. As for the diet, it’s the same stuff we were hearing 30 years ago and a claim that has no empirical or scientific basis. A South Asian diet has not stopped Pakistani players from dominating the stamina-intensive sport of squash or Indian stars from reaching the top of international cricket. Kids in the UK, meanwhile, are eating a diet comparable to those of their black and white peers. Everyone loves pizza. The issue of a more balanced diet is something for everyone to think about, and at Aims we share nutritional information with parents from all cultures. Information and understanding are key. The statistics with regards to South Asian representation in professional football speak for themselves: 7% of the population has 0.45% of players within the game. Something has been going wrong for a long time and the main problem has been one of structural discrimination. The architecture of football is set up in such a way that to get on, you have to be part of a network. If you look at the grassroots level you have “feeder” clubs: teams with ties to academies who are passing on talent. If you don’t know who they are and you’re not involved in those networks then you won’t be able to get into the system. Up until recently South Asian parents have not been familiar with the architecture and haven’t known how the networks operate. We think that is changing. The community has become part of the landscape and initiatives that have been undertaken help people to start plugging in. The numbers of South Asians within the system have increased. But there is a second hurdle once you are in the system too; the unconscious bias we all hold that shapes our perceptions of others. We can see how stereotypes linger about people from the remarks made by the chairman of Middlesex County Cricket Club in the wake of the Azeem Rafiq scandal. Mike O’Farrell told a parliamentary committee that “football and rugby [is] much more attractive to the Afro-Caribbean community” while Asian players won’t “commit the same time” to succeed in cricket because they “prefer to go into other educational fields”. We heard similar from the former Football Association chair Greg Clarke in remarks that led to his resignation in 2020. This is why Amir Khan’s remarks are so dispiriting: because they perpetuate stereotypes. They are images that are out of date because the picture on the ground has changed. Football clubs want players who are talented and bright. We have players within the Aims programme who are academy scholars and sitting not only their BTecs but A-levels too. Because of Brexit, football clubs are having to move away from recruiting young talent in Europe. They are concentrating more on the talent on their doorstep, and the South Asian community is ready to engage. Families are now educated about the networks and ready to access them. From Hamza Choudhury and Dilan Markanday to Zidane Iqbal an absence of role models is changing. There’s that subconscious bias, but it too will be whittled away in time. We are not alone in being invested in the game and coming with solutions. Things will change and we have no doubt that South Asian players will feature in our nation’s contribution to the most popular sport on the planet.

5/19/2022,"As another nailbiting, squeaky‑bum Premier League season nears its end, the veteran referees Mike Dean, Jon Moss and Martin Atkinson are hanging up their boots. Here, Big Brother-style, are their best and worst bits. Premier League debut Leicester City v Southampton, 2000 Games 559 Red cards 114 Yellow cards 2,026 Most controversial decision Showing West Ham’s Sofiane Feghouli a straight red for an innocuous 50-50 challenge with Manchester United’s Phil Jones – a decision described by pundit Niall Quinn as “rank bad refereeing” and later overturned. It’s only right to start with the most controversial of our retiree‑referees, something he would no doubt appreciate, as there’s no lack of ego where Dean is concerned. Dean has the dubious honour of being roundly disparaged by pretty much all fans, but he might argue the adage that if you’re not pissing someone off then you’re doing something wrong. It’s very easy to piss Dean off: he hands out cards with the abandon of a leaflet-thrusting religious zealot on Oxford Street. He has been a Premier League referee since 2000 – that’s 559 matches and counting – and in that time he has issued an unprecedented 114 red cards and an almost unbelievable 2,026 yellows, awarding 184 penalties. Those figures, as you might imagine, are well clear of other officials in the league. But flourishing cards isn’t all for which Dean is known: there are the high-jinks, as when he hid the match ball from the hat‑trick‑scoring Sergio Agüero, and the showboating stepovers. It should come as no surprise then that “Deano” is a former ballroom dancing champion. (I would put money on a future Strictly Come Dancing appearance.) He has also pioneered the ostentatious “no-look booking”, like a whistle‑toting version of Roberto Firmino. There’s an argument that Dean has made the game livelier because it’s great to have a theatrical pantomime villain to boo. But there’s also the argument that nobody forks out for a ticket to see the referee, nor to sit through endless stoppages so, maybe, you know, cool it. But refereeing is an often thankless task and, appearing on That Peter Crouch Podcast, Dean told of how, for 16 years, he would get up at 3am, go to his job slaughtering 140,000 chickens in a factory on the Wirral (strong vibes of Margi Clarke in Letter to Brezhnev) then on to his part-time refereeing job in the afternoon. That’s the kind of dedication which won’t get the plaudits of a teenage Mo Salah’s nine hours spent on 10 different buses en route to training, but is nonetheless impressive. Perhaps the most pervasive rumour about Dean is that he is a Spurs fan (he’s actually a diehard Tranmere supporter) thanks to two infamous incidents where it very much looked like he was celebrating Tottenham goals during matches he was officiating. First there was the hop, skip and jump after a Louis Saha strike in a 2012 north London derby (after Dean had played an advantage), then the outstretched arms after a 2015 Mousa Dembélé goal against Aston Villa. (Dean has since clarified that what he was celebrating was, essentially, his own genius decision-making, which is peak Dean.) Arsenal fans’ particular animus against him once resulted in 100,000 of them signing a petition to get him banned from the game. Throwback to the time Mike Dean hid the ball from hat trick hero Sergio Aguero 😂Happy Birthday to a Premier League legend! 👏 pic.twitter.com/vaCS0RzUK9 It isn’t just fans who have beef with Dean, though; he’s irritated plenty of players and pundits. Sky Sports’ Alan Smith accurately assessed that Dean “wants to be the centre of attention” and Gary Lineker, Martin Keown, Stephen Hunt, Alan Shearer and a host of others have let their feelings be known over some of his performances. Other Dean highlights (or lowlights) include that time Louis van Gaal threw himself to the ground in a mock-dive when trying to sway Dean, who was acting as fourth official. Dean isn’t done annoying people just yet – he’s said to be taking a full‑time spot at Stockley Park, and he’s already served as a VAR official before now. Premier League debut Blackpool v Birmingham City, 2011 Games 274 Red cards 39 Yellow cards 892 Most controversial decision In a season which will once again be decided by the slimmest of margins, Moss was roundly criticised for awarding Manchester City a possibly title-deciding penalty when the ball hit Wolves’ João Moutinho’s armpit. Moss is a lower-profile official than Dean, but he hasn’t escaped his own accusations of arrogance – and he has certainly caused his own headlines. In a trigger-happy 2014 game between Manchester City and Tottenham, Moss awarded no fewer than four penalties – only two of which could be objectively considered definite (or, in current parlance, “clear and obvious”). A couple of years ago Moss was investigated – and then backed – by the Football Association after telling the Bournemouth player Dan Gosling: “I’m not the reason you are in relegation trouble – you are!” Tellingly, however, Moss did not deny the remark, but he was cleared on the basis that it was “a very challenging game for Jon and his officials”. On a lighter note, Moss was good-naturedly but mercilessly mocked for having his nickname, “Mossy”, embroidered on the boots he wore for the FA Cup semi‑final. Ally McCoist laughed: “I’m not having ‘Mossy’ written on his boots, I’m not having it. If you’re David Beckham I’m having it all day, but he shouldn’t be doing it!” Referee John Moss has 'Mossy' on embroidered on his boots 👀Discuss... pic.twitter.com/QSEDMqxbyo Perhaps Moss’s second-most embarrassing moment was when a pitchside microphone picked up him saying to his assistant Eddie Smart in the 87th minute of a Liverpool v Spurs fixture: “I’ve got no idea whether Lovren’s touched the ball to be honest with you … I’m giving the penalty.” Which doesn’t seem like particularly sound decision-making and led to Jürgen Klopp declaring in his press conference that his honest opinion of what transpired would lead to “the biggest fine in the world”. In another game featuring Liverpool the Aston Villa manager, Steven Gerrard, was not happy with Moss’s performance and, told Moss was retiring this season, responded cuttingly with: “Good.” Off the pitch Moss has, somewhat surprisingly, established his own record store in Leeds, describing his youth as: “Spending [my] student grant on records … playing football Saturday morning, then Saturday afternoon go round the record shops.” What does he stock? Joy Division, the Beatles and Tracy Chapman. Gerrard, one assumes, will not be paying a visit. Premier League debut Crystal Palace v Manchester City, 2004 Games 461 Red cards 67 Yellow cards 1,485 Most controversial decision Not a single decision, but Atkinson was “given a break” after a poor performance throughout a Chelsea v Burnley game in 2015. Atkinson has been officiating in the Premier League since 2004, but he actually started as a professional referee as a 16-year-old. The confessed Leeds United fan has had much beef with fierce Leeds rivals Manchester United over the years, due to accusations of anti-United bias during their matches. During an infamous 2009 match against Chelsea, Wayne Rooney muttered “12 men” to the camera, referring to his opinion that Atkinson was favouring Chelsea. According to Alex Ferguson, Atkinson’s performance was “why people lose faith in refereeing”. But perhaps Atkinson’s nemesis is fellow former referee Mark Clattenburg, who once detailed the “war” between the two. According to Clattenburg: “We never got on. We were playing five-a-side in the gym. I caught him with a tackle. He threw a punch, and I threw a punch back.” Atkinson was also caught snubbing a Leighton Baines handshake at the end of an Everton v Arsenal fixture – although nobody has been able to work out why. But one player he did like – telling one interviewer he “really got on with him” – was Arsenal’s Tomas Rosicky. Upon finishing his onfield career, Atkinson will join Moss in taking up a position at the PGMOL, guiding the new generation of officials.",Sport/Football,"The highs, the lows, the reds and yellows: farewell Mike, Martin and Mossy | Hannah Jane Parkinson",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/19/the-highs-the-lows-the-reds-and-yellows-farewell-mike-martin-and-mossy
5/19/2022,"Labor says the party’s decision to post $7.4bn in higher deficits than forecast over the next four years was not “made lightly”, but the spending is necessary to grow the economy. As he released the costings on Thursday, the shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said Labor had been through the budget carefully to identify savings to offset most of its proposed spending, which it has emphasised will help boost productivity. The party said its measures will tally $7.4bn more than what was outlined in the pre‑election economic and fiscal outlook, while the government has pledged to improve the budget balance by $1bn, giving an $8.4bn difference. Labor’s biggest revenue measures include a $3bn cut to public service spending on contractors, $3bn gained through extending Australian Tax Office compliance measures, almost $2bn from a crackdown on multinational tax avoidance and $560m through a new competition policy that imposes large fines for anti-competitive behaviour. It will also scrap two government programs to save $750m and abolish a 10% discount for upfront payment of Higher Education Contribution Scheme (Hecs) fees to save $150m. Chalmers said that while there was potential for more savings once it was in government on areas such as the national disability insurance scheme, the party had decided the extra spending “was absolutely crucial” to growing the economy in the right way and had been “rigorous” in its assessment of savings. “We have gone through very carefully every bit of spending from the government, every bit of proposed spending from us, so we don’t take these decisions lightly,” Chalmers said. “We feel that the budget would be weaker without investing in crucial economic policies like childcare, cleaner and cheaper energy and trade. And so we’ve made that judgment not lightly, but in the interest of the economy into the future, because we want to make these decisions based on economics, not politics.” Labor’s most expensive policies include its $5bn childcare policy, $2.5bn for aged care, $1bn for its powering Australia policy, $800m for fee free Tafe, and $750m extra for Medicare. Chalmers said the investments were worth doing. “If you start from the basis of what’s best for the economy is best for the budget, then these investments are absolutely necessary and we’re proud of them.” The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, slammed the party’s costings as a “farce”, saying Labor had not been submitted its spending measures to the Parliamentary Budget Office. “Labor’s own admission in Labor’s own document is every year, debt is higher under Labor, deficits are higher under Labor and taxes are higher under Labor,” he said. “Their attempt today at releasing their costings was a farce because there was no independent verification of their policy costings.” The government’s revised costings revealed a $1bn improvement to the budget bottom line based on $3.3bn in spending cuts in the public service, including a $2.7bn saving as a result of an increase to the efficiency dividend. The government’s figures show cumulative deficits over the next four years totalling $223bn. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, defended releasing the party’s costings on the Thursday before the election, which was the same time as the Coalition released its costings in 2010, 2013 and 2019. When asked how he could be sure that Labor’s additional spending would not further stoke inflationary pressures, Albanese said Labor was focused on improving productivity. “The measures that we’re aiming at here, whether it’s childcare, whether it’s clean energy, or skills and training, are precisely aimed at that,” he said. “That’s why we have prioritised those investments.” But Frydenberg said there were doubts about how the extra spending could lead to inflationary pressures and higher interest rates. On Thursday, figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed Australia’s unemployment rate had fallen to a 50-year low of 3.9%, prompting Morrison to say the jobless rate was the government’s most important task.",News/Australia news,Labor defends $7.4bn increase in deficit to fund election promises,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/may/19/labor-defends-74bn-increase-in-deficit-to-fund-election-promises
5/19/2022,"To be a musician is to learn to live with paradox. That is the conclusion that Jeremy Denk, a first-rank American concert pianist, has come to after more than 40 years of work on his playing. In classical music, there are always more details to be fine-tuned and technical challenges to be overcome, but the obsession with total mastery can also be what keeps you from obtaining it. Denk’s mentor, the Hungarian-American pianist György Sebők, once told his pupil that his big problem was that he was a perfectionist – even though everything about his musical education was aimed at making him so. The true musician must accept that they cannot win, then, but keep trying anyway. Denk’s credentials are impeccable: in addition to being awarded a MacArthur fellowship (or “genius grant”), he has toured the world, plays regularly at Carnegie Hall in New York, and topped the Billboard classical chart with his recording of Bach’s Goldberg Variations. In 2014, his take on Beethoven’s final piano sonata was chosen by Radio 3’s Building a Library as the best recording made to date on a modern piano. Reviewer David Owen Norris declared Denk “a modern pianist who knows all the old stuff” and who can deliver an authentic performance in the manner of a skilled orator: dramatic, compelling, but not hammy. When such a prodigious talent in another field takes to writing books, though, the discerning reader is right to be wary. “How I made it” memoirs in classical music tend to fall into one of two categories: the cheesy, often ghostwritten story of glossy success; and the against-the-odds tale of the cool outsider who broke all the rules, refused to wear a bow tie on stage, but still hit the big time in the end. Neither is especially joyful or enlightening to read. Every Good Boy Does Fine, Denk’s tale of his journey from his first piano lessons in New Jersey at the age of six to the completion of his doctorate in piano performance at the Juilliard school in his 30s, is an exception to this rule. It began life in 2013 as an article for the New Yorker, and has now been expanded into an elegant, frank and well-structured memoir that entirely resists cliche. The book’s subtitle is A Love Story, in Music Lessons. Denk uses his progress through the musical education system to provide a framework for a broader coming-of-age narrative, in which he becomes comfortable with different kinds of love: for music, for family, for friends, for romantic partners. He starts lessons with a neighbourhood teacher after his parents receive a warning at school that young Jeremy is likely to get into “emotional trouble” unless they find an outlet for his pent-up feelings. He quickly outgrows these lessons and is passed on to another, more serious, instructor, and then another and another. One of his more influential early tutors, William Leland, kept a meticulous journal for the young Jeremy in which he wrote feedback during each lesson and set homework for the next. Instead of the star stickers usually deployed by music teachers, William drew little cartoons, tailoring them to the message he wanted to convey. In good weeks, the stars beamed with pride or wore haloes; in bad ones, poor Jeremy was denied a star at all and instead received a drawing of a disappointed-looking slug or centipede. Years later, phrases from this notebook still plague Denk as he sits down to give concerts. As charming as the drawings were – reproductions of them and other musical annotations from his childhood are sprinkled throughout the book – the criticisms they embodied stuck. Denk is at his best as he relates the intimate details of striving to be better at something as confoundingly difficult as advanced classical piano. There is a deep joy to be found in repetition, in outgrowing the material you work on and encountering new pieces you have yet to grow into. Practising an instrument is, at times, just a painstaking process of reasoning with one’s own muscles until they will perform unlikely-seeming movements without thought. Brain and body fight each other over finger positions and movements. In one instance, Denk describes the process of mastering a tiny seven-note sequence in Brahms’s Second Piano Concerto after having strained his fingers as “ping-ponging between mind and muscle” and “smoothing out the lumps, as if piano playing were making mashed potatoes”. To make music that sounds like it is as easy as thought or desire, it is necessary to sweat and scrape and make some very ugly mistakes – and then make them again. As he documents his own progression up the ranks of classical music, Denk also weaves in gentle stories of his family and how his early love of music both pulled them together and made him feel set apart. He describes the “too holy, too radioactive” experience of listening to Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante on cassette for the first time at the age of 12 and immediately wanting to throw open his bedroom door to share what he’d heard with his parents. But fear that he will be made fun of quickly checks the impulse: his father will tease him, his brother will think he is showing off, his mother will ask him to do a chore instead. So he sits on the floor and listens alone. One of the most refreshing things about Denk’s writing is his relaxed approach to the music itself. There is no unnecessary complexity or pretension in the way he writes about Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and the rest. He doesn’t shy away from using musical terminology, but deploys little hand-drawn diagrams and extracts from scores to make it absolutely clear what he is describing. The result is a light, informative tone that will be readable for both diehard classical music fans and complete newcomers alike. It’s a rare feat. Instead of a bibliography, the book has an annotated playlist for anyone curious to listen during or after reading, which is a nice touch. Perhaps this account’s greatest achievement, though, is that it makes the reader care about Denk beyond his talent for playing the piano. After documenting all the years of determination and pain it took for him to master the great composers, it is for his happiness, rather than his success, that we are rooting. At 32, his doctorate finally out of the way, he locks eyes with someone he likes and realises that he didn’t need to come out because he “was already way, way out”. That summer of glorious first love is everything the most passionate music has ever promised him: “I think I played the piano; I just don’t remember,” he writes.
