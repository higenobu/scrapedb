2/27/2022,"Mike Lindell erupted at CBS journalist Robert Costa over his questions about a 2021 White House meeting. Lindell refused to tell Costa who drafted the election documents where ""martial law"" was mentioned. The MyPillow CEO has been one of the highest-profile proponents of Trump's debunked election claims. MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell on Saturday erupted at the CBS News correspondent Robert Costa after being questioned about the details of documents that were seen at the White House regarding the 2020 presidential election. The incident occurred at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Florida soon after Costa — who cowrote the book ""Peril"" with veteran journalist Bob Woodward — pressed Lindell over the attorneys who drafted the election-related documents that were shown to mention the words ""martial law."" While at CPAC, Costa tried to follow up on a story published last year in The New York Times by reporter Maggie Haberman about the January meeting between then-President Donald Trump and Lindell at the White House. In the article, Haberman detailed that Sidney Powell — the election conspiracy theorist who has continued to allege voter fraud in the 2020 contest despite a lack of evidence — was also mentioned in the notes. Despite repeated attempts, the names of the lawyers who drafted the papers remained unknown, and Costa approached Lindell to find out the missing piece of information. —Robert Costa (@costareports) February 26, 2022 When Costa asked Lindell who drafted the papers, he responded: ""That's none of your business. A bunch of lawyers did. I never read them."" Lindell then laced into a range of debunked conspiracy theories involving Dominion Voting Systems. The businessman said that he ""never"" discussed the issue of martial law with Trump, and then told Costa ""to go back watching your old rotten news."" Lindell then started yelling at Costa and deriding him as a ""traitor,"" prompting others to jump into the mix. ""You're a traitor!"" Lindell said. ""This is old news you're regurgitating."" Lindell, one of Trump's staunchest supporters, continues to travel the country to speak with activists and push the unfounded allegations of voter fraud that the former president himself still perpetuates among the Republican faithful.

2/27/2022,"A clear majority of Americans think Vladimir Putin would not have ordered the Russian invasion of Ukraine had Donald Trump still been in the White House, according to a new poll. Related: Tucker Carlson leads rightwing charge to blame everyone but Putin The poll, by the Harvard Center for American Political Studies (Caps)-Harris, found that 62% of those surveyed believed Putin would not have sent troops into Ukraine with Trump in the White House. In partisan terms, the survey found that 85% of Republicans and 38% of Democrats held the view. The poll, conducted on Wednesday and Thursday this week among 2,026 registered voters, found that 59% said Putin only ordered the invasion because he saw weakness in Joe Biden. Forty-one percent said the US president was not a factor in Putin’s decision. Republicans in Congress have attacked Biden for perceived weakness in the face of autocratic leaders abroad. Party figures have been less keen to discuss Trump’s expressions of admiration for Putin during the Ukraine crisis. The Harvard study’s findings broadly buttressed a Fox News poll, carried out before Russia invaded, that found more Republicans had a negative view of Biden than of Putin and more Democrats had a negative view of Trump than of the Russian leader. That study said 92% of Republicans had a negative view of Biden while 81% had a negative view of Putin. Among Democrats, 87% had a negative view of Trump and 85% a negative view of Putin.

2/27/2022,"Two years ago, at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, any Covid tests were hard to come by. While it’s proven to be challenging to find a testing site at peak travel times, there’s no denying that they’re definitely easier to get your hands on than they were in 2020. And back then, who would have thought you might be able to take a test at home by now, in addition to having various vaccine options? The holiday season and start of the new year brought a headache of long waits at Covid testing sites and a shortage of available home tests for purchase as people sought to protect their friends and family from infections, especially with the rise of the Omicron variant. This was frustrating for many, as the last thing any of us need is additional stress as we still try to navigate this thing in the safest way possible, right? Last month also brought the ability for any U.S. household to obtain four free tests from the government. Whether you hopefully took advantage of that and signed up to receive your mini-stash, or stocked up from wherever else you could buy them, you’re probably closely guarding them until you need them (i.e. when you’re about to travel, or if you’re experiencing any Covid symptoms). Something that may or may not have crossed your mind, however, is if you’re storing them properly. Turns out there is a right way to do this. Here’s the lowdown on what you need to know to keep your home tests in prime condition as you save them for when you truly need them. Temperature changes are the main culprit that can negatively affect the validity of Covid tests, and extreme temperature changes specifically can degrade the chemicals within the solution needed to run the test, explains Suneet Singh, M.D., an emergency medicine physician and medical director at CareHive Health in Austin, Texas. “This, in turn, can affect the accuracy of the results because the validity of results are placed into question when improper storage and handling issues arise,” he says. According to Dr. Singh, Covid tests should be stored at room temperature to avoid diminishing their overall accuracy. “The overall acceptable range tends to be 35 to 86 degrees, but be sure to check the information provided by the manufacturer specific to the test you have,” he explains. “If your tests happen to go out of this range for up to a day, your tests may still work, but the validity of the test, especially if negative, will be in question.” When storing your tests, you should avoid keeping them in any area that is prone to fluctuations in temperature, Dr. Singh says. For example, bathroom shelves might not be a good idea if the area steams up when someone is taking a shower. Similarly, an area that is exposed to direct sunlight would also not be your best bet, either. Opt for a cool, dark place like pantry or kitchen cupboard shelves, or in a bedroom or closet, over a bathroom or light-filled space. According to Dr. Singh, you should go ahead and toss your tests in the trash if they’ve spent longer than a day outside of the acceptable temperature range described above. “For tests that have been kept in a non-optimal location but it has been less than one day, it is recommended to return the test to a climate-controlled area that is at room temperature,” he says. “But again, the results of these tests may not be as accurate compared to tests that have always remained at a suitable temperature.” You’ll likely also want to restock your stash to store them accordingly in the future. In any case, if you’re experiencing symptoms, stay home and maintain distance from others until you start to feel better. If you test negative with a potentially faulty test, hopefully you can obtain a new at-home one or visit a testing site, but do your best to protect others in the meantime.
