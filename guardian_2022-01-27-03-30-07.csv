1/27/2022,"Online grocery specialist Ocado has developed robots which it says will enable cheaper, faster deliveries and help with labour shortages by requiring fewer staff in its warehouses. Tim Steiner, the chief executive of Ocado, said the new technology was a “game changer” that would enable the group’s retail partners to automate picking in smaller local warehouses and provide a “compelling immediacy proposition” that could take on the likes of Getir, Deliveroo and GoPuff, the fast-track food couriers which have grown rapidly during the pandemic.  A robotic picking arm, expected to be introduced in new and some existing warehouses from the end of this year, could reduce the need for workers to pick and pack groceries into shoppers’ bags by up to half initially, and 80% longer term. Another new system, which will automatically pack totes of groceries destined for shoppers homes into crates ready to be loaded onto vans, will reduce labour costs by 30% and could replace manual labour entirely in this role. Steiner said the new technologies were “transformational in the market and really drive our innovation forward” in a way that would “shatter the existing rules of the industry”. He said: “All companies we are working with are having challenges employing enough people to work.” He said most warehouses were still not at full capacity, and so new technology would mean that workers could be redeployed from certain jobs to others and he did not expect waves of redundancies. Ocado has also designed a new lighter and cheaper version of its grocery picking robots which buzz about on top of a cubic grid known as “the hive” which stores products ready for distribution. The 600 series robots will be five times lighter than their predecessors so that they can work on more lightweight grid systems in smaller warehouses around the world. Steiner said as the systems would not require specially built warehouses, unlike its current grid system, so Ocado’s technology could be set up more quickly for its clients, which include Marks & Spencer in the UK and Kroger in the US. With over half of their parts 3D printed, the robots can also be more easily made around the world. These robots are intended to be combined with new software systems that will enable local delivery vans to be loaded more quickly, mixing orders made less than an hour before they set off with those made the night before. That will enable quick deliveries to be made much more efficiently. Software will also link up smaller warehouses to create a system where products delivered to one can be shared between several locations to help improve efficiency. Steiner said Ocado envisioned providing “a service that could have a supermarket range s of 10.000 to 15,000 products available in the time frame of a rapid delivery could provide at the same price of a Sainsbury Local [convenience store]”.",News/Business,"Ocado develops robots to enable faster, cheaper deliveries",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/26/ocado-develops-robots-to-enable-faster-cheaper-deliveries
1/27/2022,"Britain and other Nato allies are considering a request from the US to deploy hundreds more troops to support member countries in eastern Europe in advance of any Russian invasion or attack on Ukraine. UK defence sources indicated that the US wanted contributions to help reinforce Nato’s eastern flank, from the Baltic states to Romania and Bulgaria in the south, as the Ukraine crisis continues.  Any extra British troop deployment would probably involve a few hundred personnel in the Baltic region. The UK already leads a Nato battlegroup in Estonia with 900 personnel, and it has 150 based in Poland under a US command. It is one of a number of options being considered by the UK in a rapidly evolving response to the Russian buildup of forces on the borders of Ukraine. Analysts estimate that as many 125,000 troops have now massed near the country’s borders. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, said on Wednesday that the UK was considering how it could contribute to increased deterrence across land, sea, air and cyberspace, as he visited Nato’s headquarters in Brussels. “The US has asked us, and we are considering it,” a defence source said. A day earlier, Boris Johnson told MPs: “If Russia invades Ukraine, we would look to contribute to any new Nato deployments to protect our allies in Europe.” But the latest discussions go further. Earlier this week the US put 8,500 troops on heightened alert for deployment to Europe if Russia invades Ukraine, while France indicated it was willing to move soldiers to Romania under Nato command. Wallace was engaged in a series of visits in Europe, visiting his Dutch and German counterparts as well as Nato. A key focus, he said, was to press Berlin to support tougher sanctions on Russia if it were to attack. “What we want from Germany, as the biggest economy in Europe, is a stronger signal on sanctions,” the defence minister said to journalists travelling with him, reflecting UK concerns that Berlin is worried about the impact of Russia cutting off the export of gas to Europe in retaliation. On Tuesday Johnson told MPs that Britain had to “encourage our friends” – a veiled reference to Germany – to sign up to “a tough package of economic sanctions” despite the fact that they had a “heavy dependence … on Russian gas”. On Tuesday night it emerged that the US was making plans to find alternative supplies of gas for Europe if the flow from Russia is cut. Germany depends on Russian gas for about a third of its supply; the UK about 3%, according to Johnson.",News/World news,UK and Nato allies consider US request to send more troops to eastern Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/uk-and-nato-allies-consider-us-request-to-send-more-troops-to-eastern-europe
1/27/2022,"The head of the BBC has insisted “it is not for one person to decide the funding model” of the corporation, in a swipe at the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries. Dorries confirmed last week that the licence fee would be frozen for two years, remaining at £159 until April 2024, after which it would rise in line with inflation for four years. The announcement was made in a Sunday newspaper and on Twitter.  Addressing the public accounts committee on Wednesday, Tim Davie, the BBC director general, said the announcement had taken him by surprise, but he had been “expecting an agreement within the next few days”. He said he had been disappointed by the announcement and it would leave the BBC with a funding gap of £285m by 2027. However, he was pleased the corporation would have “six years of certainty”. He said that after that there would be a “process” with a public consultation to decide future funding models. “I don’t think it’s for one person to decide the funding model of the BBC. We need to go through that properly. And I think the licence fee has proven itself to be very strong in what it delivers.” Davie said there was “a lot to play for and a lot at jeopardy,” and he praised the corporation’s unique model. He said the BBC was important for democracyand for its commercial and economic value. “There is a lot made at the BBC that flows out [to the broader economy]. We are accountable, and obsessed with household value … I worry if we dismantle this then it is a disservice to culture and democracy but also the economic health of our creative industries,” he said. Davie gave a projection on the hole that the licence fee settlement has blown in the BBC’s finances, telling MPs the corporation had a “£1.4bn challenge” over the next six years. After the freezing of the licence fee was announced last week, Davie told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme there was “no doubt” the deal would affect the broadcaster’s frontline output. He argued for a publicly backed model for the organisation, in the face of recent suggestions from the Conservative government that the future of its funding was up for discussion. Revealing that the settlement would leave a £285m gap in funding by 2027, Davie said: “We are disappointed, we would have like to have seen an inflation rise throughout the period. We’ve got four out of six years and on we go. I would say having certainty of income for six years – as you know the media market is moving so fast – is very material to us. “Our estimate is – and just to set this clearly for everyone – by the year end 2027, the licence fee income will be about £4.2bn, based on our assumptions around inflation. Obviously guessing games around inflation are difficult. We know this settlement … gives a £285m gap at the end of the period.”",News/Media,BBC boss takes swipe at Nadine Dorries over BBC funding,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/jan/26/bbc-boss-takes-swipe-at-nadine-dorries-over-bbc-funding
1/27/2022,"Afghans who worked for the British but were not able to get on flights out of Kabul said the revelation that Boris Johnson appears to have personally approved the evacuation of animals last August added to their pain and despair. “People have died in Afghanistan, because of their connections to the UK, but the prime minister was just allowing animals to get out of there,” said Asif*, a senior adviser to British aid projects for several years. “It is like a joke. I see now that animals have a higher value than us.”  His pregnant wife was shot by Taliban gunmen who raided their home in autumn 2021. She died in hospital days later from her injuries. Despite years of service, and support from his former employer, he was told he was ineligible for refuge in the UK because he was a contractor rather than a direct employee. He has fled Afghanistan and is now living in a mosque in a neighbouring country, but the Taliban threatened his brother, demanding that he reveal where Asif was hiding. “We are human beings living here like animals, while they are rescuing animals from Afghanistan. It’s very painful,” Asif said. Abdullah*, a British embassy security guard who worked for GardaWorld in a management role, said he remembered waiting at the airport gate beside vans full of dogs. “They got clearance, and we didn’t. We were there at the same day, waiting at the same gate,” he said. “We’ve talked about it a lot – all the guards were very angry – they gave priority to dogs over guards who had spent years serving the British government. Our buses were full of women and children – none of us got through. It was such a bad day for us.” About 180 colleagues had been told they would make one of the last evacuation flights, but their departure was halted when Islamic State bombed an airport entrance. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) made a clear commitment that all GardaWorld staff would be allowed to travel to the UK, but this has not happened. “We’re still here waiting. Since the embassy closed, we don’t have jobs, we don’t have money to buy food. It’s been minus 15 in Kabul, and some of us don’t have money to buy a kilo of wood to heat our homes,” Abdullah said. “We’ve been told that GardaWorld staff will be eligible for evacuation under a new scheme, but we’re still waiting. We really hope that the British government will prioritise us now.” Asif and Abdullah’s stories formed part of the Guardian’s Afghanistan: the left behind project. The series featured the stories of those who were trapped, in Afghanistan or in limbo as they searched for safe haven, fearing for their lives from Taliban attacks or through hunger because they could not work. *Names have been changed to protect anonymity",News/World news,‘It’s a joke’: left-behind Afghans despair at dog rescue revelations,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/its-a-joke-left-behind-afghans-despair-at-dog-rescue-revelations
1/27/2022,"An 11-year-old schoolboy who was struggling with his homework was referred to the Prevent counter-radicalisation programme after a fellow pupil reported him saying during a fire drill that he wished his school would burn down. The boy is deemed to be vulnerable and is on the school’s special educational needs register owing to suffering from anxiety after witnessing domestic violence in the family home at the age of four and having to move to a safe house for a year with his mother and sibling. The boy is Muslim and of Asian heritage.  The boy’s mother, herself a teacher at a different school in the area in the north of England, condemned the decision to refer the boy. She told the Guardian: “Being a brown, Muslim, Asian boy does not make you a terrorist.” The mother said her son was suffering due to the childhood trauma he had experienced. She said the comment made by her son, while unacceptable, was an isolated one and she had discussed with him alternative ways to relieve the stress he was experiencing at school. There was no evidence, in documents about an investigation into the matter by the school, that the boy was in contact with or supported any extremist groups that could put him at risk of radicalisation, nor of a pattern of behaviour that could cause concern at school and trigger such a referral. “Prevent guidance place clear emphasis on appropriateness and proportionality,” she said. Although the Prevent officer decided swiftly not to take the complaint further, the boy’s details were automatically added to the counter-terror policing database, where they are routinely held for six years. The mother made a complaint to her son’s school about the fact she was not informed that the boy’s teachers had interviewed him about the claim he had spoken about his wish for his school to burn down, a comment reported to staff by another pupil whose younger sibling reportedly heard the boy make the remark. An investigation by the school into the mother’s complaint recommended that an apology be made over the failure to inform her about the Prevent referral. It is understood the school made the referral after consulting a local police officer, who advised it to make the referral. The Prevent officer who received the complaint very speedily closed the case and said the matter would not be investigated further. “I was told by the Prevent officer that the matter would not be taken any further as it looked like the matter related to ‘an 11-year-old boy struggling with school’, the mother said. “My son had become so unhappy and stressed about the demands placed on him relating to homework.” However, she said she had to fight to get her son’s name removed from the counter-terrorism policing database, which he had been added to even though he was just 11, had no criminal record, and the Prevent referral had been swiftly closed. “I’ve achieved a partial victory because the police have agreed to remove his name from their database but I am seeking further information from his files which are held by the Home Office,” she said. A Home Office spokesperson said: “Prevent is a safeguarding programme helping people to turn away from radicalisation. Prevent referral data is only held temporarily by the police, and parents or carers can request for it to be deleted sooner, where appropriate. “All data is kept completely confidential, other than where a serious security risk emerges. Information and guidance on the use of, and access to, the central Prevent referral database is owned by the police and not by the Home Office.”",News/UK news,"Anger over referral of vulnerable boy, 11, to counter-radicalisation scheme",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/26/anger-over-referral-of-vulnerable-boy-11-to-counter-radicalisation-scheme
1/27/2022,"Polly Toynbee (The verdict is in: George Osborne’s help-to-buy scheme has been an utter disaster, 25 January) further exposes the lie behind the government’s policies, that by encouraging private home ownership we will solve the housing crisis. Her article confirms that the origins of the crisis are in the right-to-buy policies of the 80s, compounded by the refusal to allow the proceeds to fund new council stock and dismantling the Fair Rent Act. The housing crisis results from failing to meet the housing “needs” of those unable to afford a mortgage. Help to buy simply boosted the market demand for private housing. But if that achieved little in helping those in real housing need, how much more morally reprehensible is it that we now subsidise private landlords and their buy-to-let mortgages to the tune of £22bn a year in the form of housing benefit? It is at this level because those without access to affordable social housing cannot pay private rents set to cover the cost of a mortgage and provide the owner with a return. This is revenue expenditure that could be better used to support much-needed public services. The government will only address the housing crisis by investing significant capital over a long period of time in new social housing and seeing it as an infrastructure investment that will produce both a capital asset and an income stream to the public sector, ultimately reducing the demand and therefore the cost of private rented housing. Surely this is what levelling up should be all about?Mike LambertAldham, Essex   Polly Toynbee’s idea for a hypothecated tax on unearned property wealth, with presumably the rate of capital gains tax being increased to match that of income tax, and to be spent directly on council housing, is excellent, but more needs to be done to help tenants in the private sector immediately. That would require local councils being given additional funding to enable more property inspections to take place, and power to remove letting licences from rogue landlords. Rent caps have to be established and applied in all areas, evictions paused for a year, and housing benefit thoroughly reviewed. How ludicrous to have a system whereby a landlord can increase a tenant’s rent in the knowledge that the benefit system will cover the extra.Bernie EvansLiverpool  In an otherwise excellent article, Polly Toynbee fails to list buy-to-let mortgages as a further reason for rising prices and the difficulties faced by younger people wishing to buy their own home. While my middle-class friends buy several houses each as a way of subsidising their incomes or pensions through rent, so the share of houses available to young people is severely reduced and prices rise.Moira SykesManchester  There is another side to the picture Polly Toynbee paints. I own one house for rent, which I have always maintained to a very high standard. Last March, my tenant stopped paying any rent and says quite openly that he will stay there until I evict him, knowing full well that I must obtain a court order to do so. Covid regulations prevented me from filing court papers until early September, and five months later I am still awaiting a date for the hearing. Protection of tenants from bad landlords is fine, but let us also have some protection for landlords being cheated by unscrupulous tenants.Name and address supplied  Have an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

1/27/2022,"Jonathan Liew’s article (Sportswashing is associated with certain countries – why not Israel?, 24 January) stated that Israel uses sport as a “tool of repression”. I wonder what Bibars Natcho, the Muslim captain of the Israeli football team, would think about this statement; or the Sports in Service of Peace programme which enables Israeli and Palestinian children to play together to promote coexistence, and who participated in the Argentina-Uruguay match. While Israel may not be renowned as a sporting powerhouse, on a human level, sport is clearly an invaluable tool for promoting cooperation between peoples. According to the article, even Israelis engaging in sport is considered illegitimate. So we, Israelis, cannot do anything. Even our contributions to the international community are deemed illegitimate. Pinkwashing, greenwashing, vaccinewashing – even a peace agreement with Arab countries receives similar accusations. This is particularly dangerous, implying that Israel is not a state like any other, whose contribution to the world can be celebrated. This week marks the greatest catastrophe to the Jewish people, and it is 73 years since the UN recognised the Jewish people’s right to self-determination in Israel.

1/27/2022,"In a tiny motel at the back of a Wellington garden, a group of lodgers with shiny cigar-shaped bodies and spiny legs are making themselves at home. A male is bunking in with his harem of females, their bodies huddled together, a wiry mashup of legs and antennae. Once a fortnight the motel’s owner, Holly Neill, briefly opens the door to peer into the perspex window and check on her tenants, each time experiencing the thrill of being able to spy on the shy, strange creatures inside. They are not paying guests and nor are these ordinary motels, but rather human-made houses for one of New Zealand’s most beloved insects – the wētā. Increasingly, wētā motels are popping up in gardens as New Zealanders begin to embrace the bugs in their backyards – something that may also give the endangered species a chance at survival.  Forests, grasslands, caves and alpine terrains once crawled with wētā, but their populations have suffered with the introduction of foreign pests and increasing habitat decline due to dairy farming. Sixteen of New Zealand’s wētā species are at risk and the rest are classified as threatened or endangered. The largest species, the giant wētā (or wētāpunga), once abundant across parts of the North Island, is now found only on Hauturu-o-Toi (Little Barrier Island), a pest-free sanctuary off the east coast. The Mahoenui giant wētā, feared extinct until it was rediscovered in 1962, exists only in a patch of King Country gorse. “I think people hold them in high regard and it’s almost a point of pride to have wētā in the garden,” says Neill, a keen conservationist and wildlife photographer. “It adds another dimension of appreciation of nature if you’re including the small, more secretive bugs that come out at night.” Wētā belong to the same group of insects as crickets and grasshoppers, and there are between 70 and 100 species of wētā endemic to New Zealand. They are wingless and nocturnal, and some, including the wētāpunga, are among the heaviest insects in the world – comparable to the weight of a sparrow. Neill installed two wētā motels on native kānuka trunks at the back of her Raumati Beach garden just over a year ago, after discovering the motels at “loads of different sanctuaries”. Within three months she had her first guests. At one point she opened a motel to find a wētā, a native cockroach and a bumblebee in the same chamber. “I felt like I was interrupting a bug meeting,” Neill laughs. When she first moved into the property, the garden was overrun with agapanthus plants and weeds, where she found just three spiders lurking. She cleared it, set traps for predators, planted native trees and installed the motels. “I was shocked at how barren it was and then, since doing this, all the rooms are full [of wētā]. It shows quite a rapid change.” The motels are made of non-treated wood and are designed to have entrance and exit tunnels large enough for the wētā to crawl into but small enough that a mouse cannot. To attract wētā, they must be dark during the day. “If you were to split a log and look at what they naturally do, it’s pretty similar to that,” says Steve Rawson of Swiss Wood Technicians. He began making wētā homes in 2016 for the Department of Conservation, and in 2018 started selling them to the public, becoming one of many small retailers or community groups now doing so. Sales have plodded along, but in the lead-up to last Christmas, they sold roughly 40 motels – double that of the year prior. “We’ve noticed a real increase in sales, especially in the Wellington area,” Rawson says, something he credits to education programmes at Wellington’s urban sanctuary Zealandia. “Before that, I think a lot of people would look at wētā and think ‘Yuck, I don’t want to go near them’, but they are actually amazing creatures and they are not that horrifying at all.” The motels (sometimes called hotels or condos) were originally conceived as a research aide around 1994 by Massey University ecologist and wētā expert Steve Trewick – a scientist so dedicated to the insect, that a tree wētā, the Hemideina trewicki, was named after him. Trewick was trying to ascertain the distribution of wētā in the environment – a difficult task when dealing with a secretive, nocturnal creature – when he discovered two species sharing a dead tree trunk. “From that observation, I said, well, let’s just make our own versions of that because then we can open them up and see how many males or females are present.” A growth in higher education and deepening awareness of conservation problems could be prompting more interest in wētā and how to care for them, says Warren Chinn, an invertebrate ecologist at the Department of Conservation. “I would also say that social media and the internet has been an extraordinary boon to consciousness of conservation values. “These things have become really successful – the animal doesn’t know that it’s artificial, they just know that it’s suitable.” The motels are “undoubtedly” helpful for wētā populations, particularly in urban environments, Trewick adds, and the growth in understanding biodiversity, and caring for it, has knock-on effects for boosting other species. But the crossover of wētā motels into private backyards achieves more than helping protect wētā populations; they are also sating the curiosity of creepy-crawly fans. “I think that the most useful thing about the motels is that people see that there is much more to the biology of our planet than they would otherwise see. Most New Zealand biology is out and about at night. It’s a window on the world,” Trewick says. They are fascinating creatures to observe, Chinn adds: “If you open up the doors on the big ones … there is a density of these monsters and their great prickly legs. That is delightfully horrific.”",News/World news,‘Delightfully horrific’: wētā motels proliferate as New Zealand falls in love with the giant insect,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/27/delightfully-horrific-weta-motels-proliferate-as-new-zealand-falls-in-love-with-the-giant-insect
1/27/2022,"Gone are the days where the only backdrop to the Dubai Desert Classic is the city’s famous skyline. As a number of the world’s top golfers prepared for the 34th staging of this event, all discussion surrounded the Saudi International. Next week’s event will offer $15m in appearance fees and has become the sport’s bete noire as Saudi Arabia continues with its pursuit of a super league. Under that plan, hotly contested by the European and PGA Tours, 14 events – mainly US-based – would see players paid in telephone numbers simply for involvement. Phil Mickelson and Bryson DeChambeau have been routinely linked with the breakaway.  Rory McIlroy made his lack of interest in all things Saudi perfectly plain long ago. He speaks from afar in this context. The Northern Irishman defends the right of high-profile colleagues to go to Riyadh next week but believes lofty appearance payments can distort sport. “It’s the competitive integrity, to me,” McIlroy said. “That’s one of the biggest issues here. How hard are guys going to compete when they know that they are guaranteed whatever the money is?” McIlroy is uneasy with the notion of Saudi money automatically equalling bad money. He cites Uber as an example of a widely used company backed by Saudi’s public investment fund. Yet in professional terms, McIlroy views the potential to be a poster boy for a nation castigated for human rights abuses as not worth any cheque. “I like being my own boss,” said the four-times major winner. “I don’t want to be told what to do. I don’t want to be told where to show up, when to show up, you have so many events, you have to travel here. It’s nice to feel like taking a couple weeks off and doing that. That’s the nice thing.” One key complication with the Saudi International is that it was once the domain of the European Tour. At that point, golfers were encouraged to attend. Many signed multi-year deals to do so. There is player annoyance attached to that. “I understand the position of the Tours,” said Sergio García, who will play both this week and next. “At the same time, they have to understand all of us, too. We’re trying to achieve things, not only for myself but for my family. I’ve been a member of the European Tour for 23 years and I’ve done a lot of things to make that happen. I’ve put a lot of mileage in my body.” Asked whether existing tours should let golfers choose where they play, García said: “Probably that would be the best thing for golf. When you get banned from playing, or whatever, it hurts the game. People want to see us play all around the world and enjoy us wherever we go so I hope that won’t be a problem.” Paul Casey will join García in Saudi. The Englishman – the defending champion at the Desert Classic – remains an interesting case as an ambassador for Unicef. Casey is adamant his appearances in Saudi can be a force for good. “It’s a very difficult thing to try to communicate what happens in our golf space with revenues and how much is played for and players’ feelings towards what their share should be,” Casey said. “It’s a very difficult thing to communicate to the general public, because you look at the numbers [and they are] incredible. It’s a delicate topic and I tend to not talk about money.” Which will not stop others from doing precisely that.",Sport/Sport,Saudi elephant in room overshadows Dubai Desert Classic buildup,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/26/saudi-elephant-in-room-overshadows-dubai-desert-classic-buildup
1/27/2022,"Leading Democrats have written to Joe Biden appealing to him to stick to his promise to reduce the US reliance on nuclear weapons for its defence and to revive arms control. The letter, signed by 55 senators and representatives, was sent on Wednesday while the White House was making final decisions on the US nuclear posture review (NPR), amid reports that Biden will make only minor adjustments to the vast nuclear modernisation plans inherited from his predecessors.  “Your NPR represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ensure that US nuclear doctrine reflects your recognition that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,” the letter said. During the election campaign, Biden said the US “does not need new nuclear weapons” and pledged that his administration would “work to maintain a strong, credible deterrent while reducing our reliance and excessive expenditure on nuclear weapons”. The campaign also said it would make deterring and responding to a nuclear attack the sole purpose of the US nuclear arsenal. The current nuclear posture envisages its potential use against a range of threats, including an overwhelming cyber-attack. Despite Biden’s campaign rhetoric, an advocate for restraint in nuclear weapon modernisation and arms control was removed last year from her Pentagon post overseeing the drafting of the NPR, after a campaign against her by hawks in the defence department and in Congress. The draft NPR produced by the Pentagon is believed to be a conservative document, endorsing the existing modernisation plans, expected to cost well over $1tn. Meanwhile, allies led by France have lobbied the Biden administration not to introduce a “sole purpose” policy, concerned about the global pressure it would bring on them to change their own doctrines. The White House insists that the president will have the last word in shaping the policy. The Democrats behind the letter urged Biden to make the “sole purpose” policy part of the NPR and to scrap two new weapon variants introduced by Trump: a low-yield warhead for Trident missiles, and a planned nuclear sea-launched cruise missile, saying the moves “would further signal that the United States believes that deterrence, not war-fighting, is the sole purpose of nuclear weapons”. “Your forthcoming NPR should reflect your administration’s views, not embrace President Trump’s nuclear weapons programs,” the letter said. It was written by the two leading voices in the Senate for arms control, Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley, and their co-chairs of the Nuclear Weapons and Arms Control Working Group from the House, Donald Beyer and John Garamendi. Failure to change the status quo would fuel a cold war-style arms race with Russia and China, the letter warned, arguing: “A clean break with President Trump’s policies can send a strong signal to Russia and China that the United States believes restraint and nuclear arms reduction are measures of a country’s great power status, not nuclear weapons overkill.”",News/World news,Democrats urge Biden to keep pledge to limit nuclear weapons,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/biden-democrats-white-house-nuclear-weapons

1/27/2022,"Russia has forward-deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and even short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine’s borders.  Russia’s rhetoric has also grown more belligerent. Vladimir Putin has demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine will never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he is not likely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity has done little to dampen tensions. Putin is also short on time. His troops cannot remain out of garrison indefinitely. By late winter he will probably have to launch an attack or draw down his forces in what would look like a retreat. In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. Since then low-level fighting has continued along the front, and both sides have accused the other of violating the agreement, which observers say is close to collapse. Russia no longer wants to maintain the status quo and is looking for another way to assert control over Ukraine. As of 26 January, about 66 battalion tactical groups, the smallest operational unit in Moscow’s army, were estimated to be in place near the border. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived in spring 2021, when Russia put an estimated 110,000 troops with tanks and other heavy weaponry near the border. Russia returned some, but not all, of its troops to base in May after Putin secured a summit with Joe Biden. This assessment from December shows some of the main deployments as of late 2021: One of the largest forces to remain since May comes from the 41st Combined Arms Army, which is headquartered in Novosibirsk almost 2,000 miles away. Stationed at the Pogonovo training area south of Voronezh since spring, some of the 41st CAA forces have moved to Yelnya, a town in the Smolensk region closer to Belarus. The equipment includes motorised infantry, main battle tanks, rocket artillery and Iskander short-range ballistic missiles comprising an estimated six or seven BTGs, according to an estimate by the independent defence analyst Konrad Muzyka. Tanks, motorised infantry and rocket artillery from the 1st Guards Tank Army headquartered in the Moscow region have been moved to the Pogonovo training area, according to Muzyka’s estimates. Satellite images taken from above Pogonovo and Yelnya depict the arrival of more equipment between November 2021 and January 2022. Other recent movements show motor rifle brigades from the 49th Combined Arms Army moving towards Crimea. Artillery and air-defence assets from the 58th Combined Arms Army have also been spotted in satellite photographs taken from above Novoozerne in western Crimea. There are also units permanently deployed near Ukraine from the 8th and 20th Combined Arms Armies. And Ukraine estimates tens of thousands of troops are stationed in the Russian-backed separatist territories of Donetsk and Luhansk. Over the new year Russia has moved tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises set to take place from 10-20 February. The deployment is substantial and unusual. A map released by Ukrainian military intelligence in November showed a worst-case scenario: Russian forces crossing the Ukrainian border from the east and attacking from annexed Crimea, as well as launching an amphibious assault on Odessa with support from Russian soldiers in Transnistria and troops sent in from Belarus. Some aspects of the plan, such as offensives from the east and via Crimea, already appear possible. Others, such as an attack from Belarus, appear to factor in troops that have not yet arrived in the region. The thinking in Ukraine as of late January was that a focused attack in the east is the most likely scenario. On 21 January Ukrainian military intelligence said that since the beginning of the month Moscow had supplied separatists in eastern Ukraine with additional tanks, self-propelled artillery, mortars and more than 7,000 tons of fuel. The Kremlin has been actively recruiting mercenaries at centres inside the Russian Federation, the agency added. These unofficial soldiers go through “intensive training courses” before being smuggled across the Russian border to occupied Donetsk and Luhansk, it said. Russia’s armed forces have been present covertly in separatist areas since 2014, according to the Ukrainian government. They could openly enter the conflict and then attempt to break through Ukrainian lines, amid a general intensification of hostilities. The potential economic blowback of any new fighting would be enormous as the US and its allies are promising “significant and severe” sanctions in the event of an attack. Russia could still seek concessions from the west in negotiations while maintaining its troops along the border for a credible threat of escalation. Putin has said he believes high tensions are useful for Russia. Nevertheless, analysts say that without a clear diplomatic victory, any drawdown could look like a defeat. A potential window for any offensive in the Donbas would be after 4 February, when Putin is due to attend the opening of the winter olympics in Beijing and to meet the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Military exercises in Belarus are due to finish on 20 February, the most obvious moment for an offensive operation. The completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany via the Baltic Sea gives both sides an economic weapon. The pipeline would allow Russia to send gas to Europe without going through Ukraine, meaning Moscow could pile pressure on Kyiv without the risk that Kyiv would cut the gas supply route in retaliation. Ukraine has lobbied furiously against the project, saying it undermines its national security. However, the pipeline, which has become a pet project of Putin’s, has not yet come online, and western governments have signalled that in the case of invasion, that may never happen.",News/World news,Russia-Ukraine crisis: where are Putin’s troops and what are his options?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-ukraine-crisis-putin-troops-visual-guide-explainer
1/27/2022,"My mother, Ruth Silvestre, who has died aged 92, was a cabaret singer in the 1950s and 60s. Later she turned to writing books, including three, known as the Sunflower Trilogy, about the summers she spent away from the UK in the south west of France. Ruth was born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, to Dorothy (nee Harmsworth), a nanny, and Bill Simmonds, an engineer. A scholarship to Basingstoke high school gave her the good fortune to meet an inspirational music teacher and, as she would later write, “from then on music always seemed as essential as breathing to me”.  Moving to London in 1947, she did teacher training at Goldsmiths College (now Goldsmiths, University of London), where she met Michael Grater, a fellow student, whom she married in 1952. There she also took singing lessons with the former opera singer Catherine Rosser, who became a firm friend. A singing spot at Balsam’s restaurant in Mayfair was such a success that she decided to concentrate her efforts on cabaret, using the stage name Ruth Silvestre. A regular on the after dinner circuit in the 50s and 60s, she was able to sing in many languages, including Italian, French, Yiddish and Hebrew. In 1960 she appeared on stage as Fan-Tan Fanny and also Kama Saki in the Flower Drum Song musical at the Palace theatre in London, and in 1968 played the lead role of Aldonza in Man of La Mancha at the Piccadilly. Afterwards she continued with cabaret engagements, seasonal work on cruise ships and occasional stage performances. There were also small roles on TV and in films, including, coincidentally, in Peter Yates’s film version of Man of La Mancha. Out of the limelight Ruth was generous with her time and talents. She joined Xenia Field’s “Old Lags” prison entertainers, was a trustee of the Cara Aids Trust and gave home schooling to children who had fallen outside the educational system. In 1976 she and Michael bought a derelict farmhouse in the south-west of France which they restored, and where long summers were shared with an eclectic mix of family, friends and locals. Diaries from this adventure led to the writing of the Sunflower Trilogy: A House in the Sunflowers (1996), Reflections of Sunflowers (2004) and A Harvest of Sunflowers (2010). Later she wrote a series of children’s books, Tom (1989), The Old Woman Who Lived in a Roundabout (1993), Henry to the Rescue (1994) and the Secret in the Storm (1995), as well as a historical account of the murder of the actor William Terriss (Final Performance, 2009). Ruth served as a committee member of the Concert Artistes Association and celebrated her 90th birthday at its club with a cabaret dinner, giving a robust performance of Maybe It’s Because I’m a Londoner. Michael died in 2003. Ruth is survived by her sons – my brother, Matthew, and me – and grandchildren, Thomas and Elliot.",Arts/Stage,Ruth Silvestre obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/26/ruth-silvestre-obituary
1/27/2022,"France’s Socialist party presidential candidate, Anne Hidalgo, has vowed to continue her campaign despite indications she has no chance of getting through to the second round of the contest in April. While political analysts and opinion pollsters have written her off, Hidalgo, who is mayor of Paris, said she remained the left’s best hope of leading France. She said it was too late to heal bitter divisions in the left, accusing rivals, including the Greens, of missing an historic chance to join forces.  Another five years of Emmanuel Macron would leave France in a dangerously “deplorable” state, she said. “It will be ungovernable. It will be unmanageable. He has not understood the French. He has not understood the country. He sees the French as infants: there’s him and a country of children who are waiting for the divine word.” In an exclusive interview with the Guardian and two European newspapers, Hidalgo also questioned the validity of the much-publicised “people’s primary”, an unofficial popular vote to designate a preferred left-wing presidential candidate that opens on 27 January and runs until Sunday. Almost 450,000 people have signed up to take part but the main left-wing candidates, Hidalgo, the Green party’s Yannick Jadot, and Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the hard-left La France Insoumise, refused to take part. Only the former Socialist justice minister Christiane Taubira, who threw her hat into the presidential election ring 11 days ago, has said she will respect the result. “Whatever the result of the vote, Mélenchon will say, I continue; Jadot will say, I continue; I will say, I continue. The primaire populaire will follow its course but it will have no consequence on my candidacy,” Hidalgo said. Opinion polls have Hidalgo trailing badly with about 3% of intentions to vote, a disastrous score that would leave the Socialist party (PS) in an existential crisis. Any candidates scoring less than 5% of the polled vote in the first round will not have their campaign expenses reimbursed by the taxpayer, making it even more difficult for the party to fund candidates in the general election that follows. In an editorial, Le Monde described the PS as a “dead star”. “The presidential candidate [Hidalgo] is paying the price for the slow decay of a Socialist party that is now a shadow of its former self with barely 22,000 members,” it wrote. “Anne Hidalgo is not entirely to blame for her underperformance in the presidential election polls, which put her under the 5% required for the campaign expenses to be reimbursed.” Polls currently show Macron likely to be re-elected after facing Marine Le Pen of the far-right Rassemblement Nationale (National rally) or the mainstream right Les Républicains’ candidate Valérie Pécresse in the second round in April. The hard-right candidate Éric Zemmour is in fourth place followed by Mélenchon, Jadot and Hidalgo. Hidalgo hit back at the polling indications. “I am not at 3%,” she said, although she could not give a figure for her support. “I am confident the dynamic can be changed because the actual campaign hasn’t yet started. Emmanuel Macron has not yet declared he is standing and we don’t yet have all the candidates at the starting line. When it kicks off a lot of things will happen very quickly,” she said. “Let’s wait for the result of the election in April. Don’t tell me what the result will be today because the opinion polls say this or that. “I’ve been invited on to television programmes and wondered what the hell I was doing there. All they wanted to talk about was the polls, the polls, the polls, while at the same time there were articles explaining how polls were done and how opinion was being largely fabricated by those polls. “People told me the problem with the polls was that I wasn’t talking about what really interests the French like immigration and integration, but the French tell me their real concerns are about their spending power, their children’s future, their worries about health … while all they hear in the media is about Zemmour.” Émeric Bréhier, director of the Observatoire de la vie politique of the left-leaning Jean-Jaurès foundation and a lecturer at the Bordeaux Institute of Political Studies, said he believed the 2022 election was lost for the Socialist party. “It’s too late for the party to make a mark on this election. Each candidate on the left is swimming in their own lane and none of them wants to budge an inch. The Socialist party is in trouble and has been for several years. I can’t see at this stage how we can get out of that,” he said. Hidalgo agreed the French left had lost its “compass” and needed to reunite voters behind her 70-point social democrat programme. She said the PS had performed strongly in local elections in 2020 and 2021, and had a reservoir of loyal grassroots support across France. Her biggest regret she said, was Jadot’s refusal to take part in a leftwing primary to select a candidate at the end of 2021. “A primary would have allowed us to put the debate back on to our subjects – the ecological, social and democratic crisis – and address the French, especially those of the left, about the subjects that interest them and show that no, the left is not dead,” she said. “We could have shown what we stand for, what are our differences and what brings us together. It was a big personal risk for me but I said I would accept the result of that vote. It was a historic chance for the left to do this, but they refused. Now it’s not possible.” She added: “Never, never can Mélenchon or Jadot win the second round. If the left has any chance of winning it’s with me … only I am capable of reuniting from the centre left to the centre right.”",News/World news,Anne Hidalgo vows to stay in race for French presidency despite dismal polls,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/anne-hidalgo-vows-to-stay-in-french-presidency-race-despite-low-polling
1/27/2022,"More than 1,300 reports of needle spiking have been made to UK police forces in less than six months, MPs have heard. Jason Harwin, the National Police Chiefs Council’s drugs lead, told a home affairs committee inquiry into spiking that police forces had received 1,382 reports of drug spiking using needles since September, compared with 1,903 crimes that could be linked to spiking in 2019.  Forces were aware of 14 secondary offences, such as sexual assault or theft, potentially linked to needle spiking, he added. Harwin, the Lincolnshire police deputy chief constable, called needle spiking “a new phenomenon” and said forces receiving an unprecedented volume of calls. Universities and student unions were also raising concerns with police, he said. “Students [are] saying ‘we are really worried about going into the night-time economy because these things are happening to our friends and colleagues’. We’ve not seen that before, the scale of that before,” he said. Dr Adrian Boyle, the head of emergency medicine for the NHS, previously told the inquiry there was “no hard, reliable data on the prevalence of spiking at the moment”, and said that in the majority of cases where people attended emergency departments with concerns about having been spiked, tests found no sedative drugs. Dean Ames, the forensic drugs operations manager at the Metropolitan police, told the inquiry on Monday that analysis of 100 toxicology samples undertaken by the Met had found “a small number of positive suspected spiking incidents to date”. About 30% of the samples contained a “controlled drug”, which could include prescribed medicines. After prescribed and self-administered drugs had been accounted for, the force had found one suspected spiking incident involving the sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine, another sample that included a chemical found in magic mushrooms, and a third containing GHB, which the committee separately heard was a viscous liquid that would be difficult to inject. Joy Allen, the Durham police and crime commissioner, said that between October and December the force recorded 82 spiking incidences, with 25 related to injections. “It’s a significant number and demonstrates the trend,” she said, adding that a “staggering” number of people who were spiked did not feel comfortable reporting it. Harwin said none of the cases of reported needle spiking had yet resulted in a prosecution, and police recognised that was “not enough”. Forces had to do more to stop offenders, make them realise they are committing a serious offence and change their behaviour, he said. Victims or witnesses of spiking can share their experiences through the committee’s public survey, which is open until 31 January.",News/UK news,"Needle spiking reports to UK police exceed 1,300 in six months",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/26/needle-spiking-reports-to-uk-police-exceed-1300-in-six-months
1/27/2022,"Police in Berlin have been authorised to crack down on protesters wearing badges resembling the yellow “Judenstern” (Jews’ star) and other symbols associated with the Nazi era at demonstrations against vaccine mandates or other pandemic restrictions. According to an internal update by the Berlin police antisemitism commissioner, first reported by the newspaper BZ Berlin, “the use of adapted ‘Jewish stars’ at gatherings can now be assumed to be a fundamental disturbance of public peace”.  Police in the German capital have been instructed to document, remove and confiscate the yellow star badges, which some German vaccine sceptics have taken to wearing with the superimposed words “ungeimpft” (“unvaccinated”) in order to draw a parallel between modern governments’ treatment of those who decline to take a jab against Covid-19 and the systematic stigmatisation of Jewish citizens in the Nazi era. The police’s internal memo clarifies that wearing the blue and white Star of David, classified as a purely religious symbol, remains legal at demonstrations. In addition, police are also instructed to take action against other analogies that trivialise the Holocaust, which are to be classified as forms of “secondary antisemitism”. The guidelines follow a ruling by a Berlin district court that came into effect last October, when a 56-year-old man was sentenced to “incitement to hatred” over a Facebook post that showed the yellow star imprinted with the words “ungeimpft”. In a possible sign that Berlin is already acting on the guidelines, a woman wearing a placard with the words “stop this genocide” was filmed being detained by police at a rally against Covid-19 vaccine mandates outside the Bundestag on Wednesday afternoon. Berlin police said its officers had briefly detained a woman and taken her details on suspicion of incitement to hatred, the concept in German criminal law that also relates to Holocaust denial. The woman’s placard also referenced Vera Sharav, a US-based Holocaust survivor who has campaigned against some practices of the biomedical industry, including vaccines for children. Inside the German parliament, delegates were for the first time on Wednesday debating a universal vaccine mandate, which some politicians argue will be a necessary tool to stop further resurgences of the virus. About 73% of Germany’s population is considered fully vaccinated against Covid-19. While the government has positioned itself in favour of a mandate, some parliamentarians from the three governing parties are opposed, while others, including Germany’s justice minister, Marco Buschmann, argued in favour of following Italy’s path in requiring only those aged over 50 to take the jab.",News/World news,Germany to crack down on Covid protesters in yellow star badges,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/26/germany-to-crack-down-on-covid-protesters-in-yellow-star-badges
1/27/2022,"My friend Ninon Leader, who has died aged 88, was a many-sided scholar and broadcaster. From 1978 until 1993, living in London, she was senior programme organiser at the Hungarian section of the BBC World Service. During these years, her radio series The Brits: A User’s Guide was a great success both in Britain and in Hungary. She wrote a book about the London she loved to explore, published in 2012 as Londonban Van, Hej, Sok Számos Utca… (There are Many Streets in London…), with the drawings of Mátyás Sárközi.  Ninon was born in Budapest, Hungary, into a Jewish family, and survived the second world war on false papers in hiding. Her father, Imre Neményi, was a journalist, who died doing forced labour under the Nazis, so for a couple of years she was in an orphans’ home. The Scottish Mission where she hid was run by her godmother, the heroic charity worker Jane Haining, who in 1944 was deported by the Nazis and murdered in Auschwitz/Birkenau. I first met Ninon, who was then married to the poet Endre Kövesi, in the youth section of the Hungarian Writers’ Union, but we became friends only later while studying Hungarian language and literature at ELTE (Budapest University) in the mid-1950s. Ninon won numerous poetry reciting competitions at the university thanks to her clear, expressive voice and impressive presentation. Though already graduated, she took part in the revolution of October 1956 started by the students, and had to flee Hungary after its brutal suppression by the Soviet army. Like many Hungarians of the same generation, after arriving in Britain, Ninon obtained a research scholarship to study, in her case at Girton College, Cambridge, where she received a doctorate in 1961. She had married Eliot Leader, a Cambridge physicist, in 1959, her first marriage having ended in divorce, and travelled with him to the University of California at Berkeley where she taught Hungarian literature from 1962 to 1965. Her doctoral thesis, Hungarian Classical Ballads and Their Folklore, published by Cambridge University Press in 1967 (and reissued in 2011) received many favourable reviews. On returning from the US, Ninon received a research fellowship at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and for some years taught Hungarian there. It was when she and her family moved to London in the 1970s that she joined the Hungarian section of the BBC and became its senior programme organiser for nearly two decades. Ninon was a most likable person, with a wonderful sense of humour who would invariably end her telephone calls with a new joke or an old anecdote. She kept her cheerfulness as well as her intellectual alertness to the very end of her life.

1/27/2022,"The Six Nations chief executive, Ben Morel, has denied that Italy’s dismal recent record is damaging the credibility of the tournament and kept the door shut on South Africa joining Europe’s premier rugby event. Speaking at the launch of the 2022 men’s edition, which begins a week on Saturday, Morel rejected the idea of promotion and relegation in the Six Nations, but said the organisation is instead putting “all our resources” into plans for a new event within existing international windows.  Italy’s last victory came against Scotland in 2015 and they endured a torrid campaign last year, with five heavy defeats accruing a points difference of minus–184. Morel, however, insisted that they deserve their place. “They’ve got young talent and they’re performing well at the Under-20s regularly,” he said. “The conversion to the senior team has been their struggle. They’re putting a lot more resources behind it, and we’ve got all the faith in their management. “This is a year they’ve got three away games [in France, Ireland and Wales], so we need to be mindful, but they’ve got a young, exciting team. They know what they need to do. I don’t believe there’s a question of credibility [for the tournament].” Asked if promotion and relegation had been considered, Morel said: “No. It’s not on the current agenda. But we understand there needs to be a pathway for emerging nations to elite rugby.” It is not just emerging nations, such as Japan, that have been mentioned as potential entrants: the world champions South Africa have also been linked with a place at European rugby’s top table. But Morel said he remains “extremely cautious on the topic” of expansion. The priority is to agree significant changes to the existing international calendar, and that conversations are “active” with World Rugby and unions about a structured tournament beginning in 2024, after next year’s Rugby World Cup. “In order to give a stronger pathway to the emerging nations, whoever they may be in the north or southern hemisphere, there could be some adaptation to the July or the November windows,” Morel said. “That could give more competitive matches to those unions … to give them the experience that they need to get to that level. I think a priority right now would be to have a more structured July and November. “Our current strategic priority is we experienced a really successful Autumn Nations Series … we believe that we could enhance the sporting narrative and give every game a meaning and a link, hopefully culminating in some sort of final weekend. “In order for this to happen post-World Cup timing, we’d need to have this finalised before the summer. So these conversations are active. [There are] a lot of people to discuss it with, a lot of consultation … hopefully a good common solution can be identified.

1/27/2022,"Nothing is more radical in fashion than an even slightly rounded thigh or tummy. At Paris haute couture fashion week, Valentino challenged the catwalk’s last taboo by using models whose bodies were mostly close to average size, rather than super skinny. With the elegant understatement for which his dresses are known, designer Pierpaolo Piccioli observed simply that he “thought it was time for a change.” The enduring hegemony of the size zero ideal in fashion has been obscured by the trend for using one or two token ‘plus size’ models in a show – often dressed in longer, looser garments than their slender colleagues, lest their flesh offend. Here, by contrast, leather-look satin hugged normal-sized curves, and sharp thigh-high splits in silk faille skirt flashed glimpses of soft thigh. Bustier dress met skin with a hint of softly oozing flesh, rather than with the clang of zipper against shoulderblade.  Fashion has trailed behind culture in clinging rigidly to model proportions unchanged in a century. Valentino looked dreamier than ever on more relatable bodies which showed off Piccioli’s skill as a couturier – a factor that will, perhaps, prompt other designers to follow suit. “The message does not change in its purpose, which is to convey beauty, but in its welcoming expression,” said the designer. Haute couture, where dresses are made to order with six figure pricetags, is a unlikely conduit for the winds of modernity, but Piccioli believes that the symbolism of diversity in fashion’s highest echelon is powerful. In five years he has revolutionised what was once a bastion of patrician glamour into one of fashion’s more progressive names. A house forged in the image of its permatanned founder Valentino Garavani, who dressed Jackie Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor and had a sofa installed on his private jet for his beloved pugs, now stands for inclusivity. This show’s casting “reflects the richness and diversity of the contemporary world and …an idea of beauty that is not absolute,” Piccioli said. Two years ago, when a Valentino couture catwalk featured a cast of 65 models, 43 of whom were black, Piccioli said that “although [couture] celebrates uniqueness, which is a synonym for diversity, it has always meant to be [sic] for white people.” He told Vogue that in the context of rising anti-immigration feeling in his native Italy “to have a Roman brand represented by Black beauty goes against all the xenophobia in Italy.” This week’s Paris haute couture shows have seen a near return to live events, although with smaller audiences due to there being few visitors from Asia. However, the run up to New York fashion week, which begins in two weeks, has been hit by announcements of delays. Tom Ford, whose show had been scheduled for the closing night of the New York shows, has cancelled the event, citing Covid-related delays. “We have struggled internally over the past month with many of our staff out with Covid in our design studio and atelier in Los Angeles as well as in our factories in Italy … [we] are faced with the sad fact that we will simply not have a completed collection in time.” Designer Thom Browne also cited manufacturing delays as a factor in the postponement of his show from February’s fashion week to an April date adjacent to the Met Gala, New York’s most star-studded annual fashion party.",Lifestyle/Fashion,Piccioli challenges catwalk’s last taboo by casting Valentino show with models of average size,https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2022/jan/26/piccioli-challenges-catwalks-last-taboo-by-casting-valentino-show-with-models-of-average-size
