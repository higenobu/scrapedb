2/2/2022,"Employers must do more to tackle the “flexible-working stigma” faced by men if they are to avoid a two-tiered workforce as people return to offices, academics and business leaders have warned. “If you have a lot more women working from home while men come back into the office it could not only be a squandered opportunity, but actually exacerbate problems of gender equality,” said Holly Birkett, the co-director o the Equal Parenting Project at the University of Birmingham.  Sarah Forbes, who co-runs the project, added: “Organisations that simply say flexible working is for all ignore the perceived barriers preventing men from applying and the flexibility stigma they face – messages need to be developed to actually target men.” Grant*, who works in financial services, has struggled to work flexibily enough to also look after his three children every other week. “It’s a challenge to have the conversation at work around part-time working as a dad. The return to the office and commute times are an added worry,” he said. Recent research from the Chartered Management Institute found that, post-pandemic, 90% of men and 87% of women wanted to continue to work remotely at least one day a week. “It’s by far the most popular benefit used to attract and retain employees no matter what their sex, even topping above-market salaries,” said the CMI chief executive, Ann Francke. “Employers who encourage greater flexibility will have an edge in gaining greater access to talent in a tight labour market.” Last year, research from the Fatherhood Institute found that 76% of partnered fathers hoped to work more flexibly in the future, with 63% hoping to work more from home. But research from the Fawcett Society in 2016 found fathers’ requests for flexible working were refused at almost twice the rate of mothers’, while Working Families found that fathers were also twice as likely as mothers to think asking for flexible working would damage their careers. Dr Jasmine Kelland, a lecturer in human resource studies at the Plymouth Business School, said her research showed men face a “father forfeit” – and were less likely to gain part-time work and more likely to be judged negatively for requesting it. In her research, managers were asked to assess four fictitious candidates for “workplace commitment”, “hireability” “promotability” and “perceived competence” – care-giving fathers were rated lower than care-giving mothers in every category, in part-time and full-time roles. “I found fathers who changed their working hours for caregiving faced mockery, were viewed as idle, faced social exclusion and were viewed with suspicion,” Kelland said, with one senior manager stating that requests would be met with “piss-taking”, including the idea the man was “a bit of a wuss, she rules the roost, wears the trousers”. “It’s not a joke, it’s not funny and we have to call it out,” she said. “We also need senior men role-modelling, perhaps saying they are going to pick up their kids then go back to work – we need to make that socially acceptable.” Some discrimination may be less obvious. Conrad*, who works in marketing, recalled that when he asked about going part-time after his second child he was told that he was “doing so well” and it would damage his career, while the request of a female colleague was supported. “I was left thinking that if I’d been a mother I would have been treated differently,” he said. Divorced fathers with rigid care schedules were desperate for more flexibility, said Michael Lewkowicz, from Families Need Fathers. “Employers need to make clear that they value and respect their employees’ family lives – and that applies to mothers and fathers,” he said. Adrienne Burgess, joint CEO at the Fatherhood Institute. said: “If employers continue to discriminate against fathers, they will vote with their feet and look for better, more flexible roles.” Iain Wilson is one of them – a foster carer to a girl with disabilities, he moved to work at Independent Living Fund Scotland because of its flexible working policies. “When I asked for flexible work at the local authority I worked at I was made to feel like an alien, but now I work for a truly flexible employer. I work extremely hard but I can work around my family – I don’t know what I would have done without it.”",News/Global development,Firms told to tackle ‘flexible-working stigma’ faced by men,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/feb/02/firms-told-to-tackle-flexible-working-stigma-faced-by-men
2/2/2022,"A Rastafarian woman who sat naked in a police cell for three hours has been given £45,000 damages after she successfully sued a police force for wrongful arrest. Yvonne Farrell told BBC Newsnight she was humiliated following her arrest by Hertfordshire police. The force has admitted it “didn’t get everything right on this occasion”.  The compensation award comes after an official report revealed shocking details of Metropolitan police officers sharing messages about hitting and raping women, as well as the deaths of black babies and the Holocaust. The Independent Office for Police Conduct said the hateful and offensive remarks were part of a Met culture that needed to be rooted out. Last week, it emerged the Met had apologised and paid compensation to an academic for “sexist, derogatory and unacceptable language” used by officers about her when she was strip-searched. Farrell was arrested after she sat on her partner’s car in Stevenage when a tow truck arrived to take it away in August 2018, the BBC reported. She refused to give her name at the police station and was taken to a cell, where she was asked to remove her clothing and was provided with a replacement “crop top and hot pants”. “I’m a 50-plus-year-old woman and a Rastafarian. Where are they going, giving me those items of clothing? I called them back and I said: ‘Listen, this is not suitable clothing. I need something long to cover,’” she told the BBC in an interview from her new home in the Caribbean. Farrell said officers said they were taking her clothes because she would not tell them who she was. “[They said] ‘We don’t know anything about you, so you can harm yourself. So with that, we’re going to take your clothes.’ That was the excuse that they gave. It’s not good enough.” Farrell said the officers should have respected her religion, which states that Rasta women should dress modestly, and given her appropriate clothing. Hertfordshire police’s professional standards department initially rejected Farrell’s complaint. She then enlisted the help of solicitor Iain Gould, who specialises in claims against the police. The force apologised for the way Farrell was treated and agreed to pay her £45,000 damages. But it did not address her claim that she had been forced to take her clothes off. In a letter, Michelle Dunn, deputy chief constable of Hertfordshire police, said: “I accept that you should not have been arrested. I am extremely sorry for any injuries that you suffered as a result of the actions of Hertfordshire police. On this occasion we got it wrong. I apologise unreservedly.” Hertfordshire police told the BBC in a statement: “The fair treatment of people detained in custody in Hertfordshire is very important. Following a review of the circumstances we accepted that, regrettably, we didn’t get everything right on this occasion four years ago. We were in regular contact with the complainant’s legal team throughout and the force agreed to settle the matter in recognition of the distress caused. The matter was settled amicably.”",News/UK news,Police apologise for wrongful arrest of Rastafarian woman left naked in cell,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/police-apologise-after-rastafarian-woman-left-naked-in-cell-after-wrongful-arrest
2/2/2022,"The home secretary, Priti Patel, has said Emmanuel Macron is wrong to say the UK’s immigration policy is encouraging people to risk their lives crossing the Channel from France. The French president has said Britain’s migration system favours clandestine migration and does not allow for asylum seekers to seek legal ways into the country.  Asked about the comments by the Labour MP Diane Abbott while appearing before parliament’s home affairs select committee on Wednesday, Patel said: “Macron’s comments are wrong. They’re absolutely wrong.” She said: “The entire French government – both the interior minister and President Macron – are fully aware through the very good work, actually, that our ambassador in Paris and her team does, in terms of number one:, the cooperation that we have to have with France to combat the dangerous and unnecessary crossings, dealing with illegal migration, but also working with like-minded partners across Europe. So, those comments are just wrong.” Macron has said he will step up the pressure on Boris Johnson to establish a legal route to Britain for asylum seekers. The president, who is seeking re-election, said current rules encouraged illegal migration and did not allow for asylum seekers to seek lawful ways into the country, pushing people to attempt the treacherous crossing instead. “The British continue to have a system from the 1980s which manages economic immigration through hypocrisy. There is no legal immigration route,” he said. “The British must articulate their needs in terms of the economy and reopen a path to legal asylum requests. We are going to step up the pressure.” Tension between the French and UK governments has increased since the sinking of a dinghy in November last year led to the deaths of 27 people, with both countries placing the blame on the other. Questioned by MPs about the reported use of Royal Navy vessels to stop people travelling across the Channel by boats, Patel said the role of the armed forces had not yet been established, and talks about their role had been ongoing since mid-January. Patel also told the committee that the government was looking into making spiking a specific criminal offence, but she said not to “expect an announcement tomorrow” as there was work to be done to understand the phenomenon and its prevalence. “I have asked my officials to look into what we know thus far with NPCC [the National Police Chiefs Council], how we can pursue offenders, but also how we can – and you’ll know that there are already a list of offences in terms of drugs that can be applied – but how we can prepare a specific criminal offence to target spiking directly,” she said. “So we are looking into this, absolutely, so we are working towards that, but it doesn’t mean tomorrow.” Referring to revelations of misogyny, racism and homophobia among officers at Charing Cross police station, Patel said it “shows a failure of leadership in some quarters”. She said confidence in the Met police had been shaken by a series of revelations in recent years, including that one of its officers was responsible for the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. “We have seen now too many times, too many instances where in policing we just see … the most appalling behaviours, the most appalling conduct,” she said, adding that she would not rule out holding further inquiries into policing conduct.",News/UK news,Priti Patel says Macron ‘absolutely wrong’ over Channel crossings,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/02/priti-patel-says-macron-absolutely-wrong-over-channel-crossings
2/2/2022,"Larb, also transcribed as larp, lap, laap, laarp and laab, is a dish that doesn’t fit easily into western boxes. A highly seasoned mixture of chopped meat, fish, tofu or mushrooms – Thai food writer Leela Punyaratabandhu clarifies that laab “is a verb denoting the mincing of meat” – that, as fellow Thai food writer Kay Plunkett-Hogge observes, can “also be referred to as a salad by virtue of its being served frequently in lettuce leaves”. It’s not even strictly Thai, though the travel hub of south-east Asia is where most Brits are likely to have come across it; a speciality of the north, it’s said to have originated with the Tai people, and variations on the dish are also found in Laos, Myanmar and south-western China. The one you’re most likely to be familiar with, though, is laarp isaan, from the north-eastern Thai region of the same name: as Punyaratabandhu explains, “the way lap is made varies from province to province, and it is hard to nail down a normative version – if there is one. But this version is the most common in Bangkok and at Thai restaurants outside Thailand. It also happens to be one of the simplest.”  Almost all the recipes I try make it clear that almost any meat will do; as Plunkett-Hogge says in her book Baan, “feel free to substitute the duck with pork, chicken or rabbit … firm tofu can also be used, as can mushrooms for non-meat eaters”. I try pork (lean is generally specified), chicken, duck and tofu, and can confirm they’re all great blank canvasses for the seasonings. But my testers and I found the chicken breast I used in Punyaratabandhu’s recipe a bit dry, so although the meat should ideally be fairly lean (it’s not cooked long enough for the fat to melt), I suspect thigh, or a mixture of the two, might be a better choice if you opt for chicken. Most recipes call for ground or minced meat, with only David Thompson specifying that it should be hand-chopped – the celebrated Australian-born chef tells Marina O’Loughlin that one should do this “just before cooking, so it doesn’t get a chance to oxidise, and you don’t get a bloody, messy mix”. Plunkett-Hogge, who sends me a video of a Karen elephant mahout chopping buffalo meat with an impressive-looking blade, says she likes to “hand-chop when I can – the meat should have a nice mouth-feel and a bit of texture. But my attitude is that the dish is so good that you can use what you can get. Most of my pals buy mince from the local supermarket or butcher. I don’t like a lot of gristle or lumps, but some do.” I also prefer the slightly larger pieces you get when you chop rather than grind meat, but if you’d prefer to buy mince, go for it. If you use tofu, I’d recommend frying it in neutral oil on a medium-high heat until golden, rather than deploying the “ruan” technique “of cooking ground meat in some water”, which Pailin Chongchitnant of the Hot Thai Kitchen blog and channel suggests came about because Isaan is a “very poor part of Thailand, and … water is cheaper than oil, so if you can make something cook in water instead of oil, then why not?” Happily, this also leaves the meat juicy, instead of greasy, as Serious Eats’ J Kenji López-Alt found the fried variety, while poaching, he says, robs the meat of some of its flavour. He describes ruan, which fries the meat in a small volume of liquid, as “the best of both worlds”. My testers and I like the way he adds a little fish sauce to the pan, so the meat absorbs some of the intensely savoury flavour that’s a key note of the dish as a whole. Often described as a salad, as Plunkett-Hogge makes clear, this is more down to the accompaniments than to the core ingredients, though she does tell me she likes her larb heavy on the shallots. These are perhaps the most common addition, usually finely sliced and raw, but I like the way Chongchitnant adds them to the hot pan to wilt. López-Alt fries his until crisp, while Thompson also mashes charred shallots into the mixture to give his version a slightly smoky back note. We find that the punchy heat of the raw variety (little red shallots are fierier than pink ones, but both will do) works best with the other pungent flavours at play here, but if you’d like a little more sweetness, you could go off piste and add crisp shallots as a garnish. Chongchitnant, López-Alt and Thompson all add spring onions, too, and the latter fried garlic as well, but I’m going to keep things simple and stick with just the one allium, because I’d like to taste the meat. Punyaratabandhu starts her dish with toasted galangal, which has a peppery, slightly bitter, aromatic flavour, while Plunkett-Hogge adds the more delicately perfumed lemongrass. Both are fine additions, if you have them, but neither feels as if they make or break the dish, unlike the sharp shallots or fresh herbs, which, as López-Alt notes, “play a major role” here. Mint and coriander are most usual, with López-Alt also suggesting basil. A recipe from the Rosa’s Thai Cafe chain includes dill, which is a little left-field, perhaps, but easier to get hold of than the sawtooth coriander or Vietnamese mint called for by Thompson, which prove elusive even after a tour of London’s south-east Asian specialists. If soapy coriander and sweet mint are good enough for Punyaratabandhu, however, they’re good enough for me. Punyaratabandhu informs readers of her book Simple Thai Food that larb should be “predominantly sour, then salty” – something echoed by Plunkett-Hogge, who describes its flavour profile as “sharp, hot and salty”. This means lots of fish sauce and lime juice, but not sugar – or at least not more than a pinch. The two tablespoons of palm sugar in the Serious Eats version reminds me of Plunkett-Hogge’s plea that the dish “should not be sweet. This is a huge bugbear of mine with Thai food – sugar has crept in where in should not be. Isaan food is sharp, hot, sour, salty – it’s a super-hot climate and you want those flavours.” That heat comes from ground dried bird’s eye chillies. López-Alt cautions that the quality of the chillies is of utmost importance: “I’ve seen recipes that call for simply using dried red chilli flakes, but they lack the dusky, smoky and sweet-hot flavour of Thai-style dried ground chilli.” Fortunately, they’re fairly readily available in their whole form, and can be ground and added to taste. Finally, we come to khao khua, or glutinous rice powder, an ingredient that sounds intimidating, but is literally sticky rice toasted in a dry pan and then smashed to smithereens in a mortar – in Chongchitnant’s opinion, “without this, it’s not a laap”. The ground rice adds a nutty, faintly bitter flavour and an interesting grittiness and, though it’s available readymade, it is much better prepared at home: as Chongchitnant notes, the aroma is “very fleeting”, so it’s worth making only as much as you need. Larb should be served warm or at room temperature with a mixture of crunchy fresh vegetables (lettuce leaves, cucumber sticks, raw beans or cabbage) and steamed sticky rice. You could top it with fresh chillies and crunchy crumbled pork scratchings, as López-Alt recommends, but I think you’d be wasting time you could be spending eating.

2/2/2022,"As the lights dim and the noise booms around her Caroline Dubois will walk to the professional ring for the first time with her trainer Shane McGuigan on Saturday night in Cardiff. Her debut in front of a packed and fevered crowd will continue one of the most intriguing collaborations in British boxing. Dubois, who has just turned 21, is the most promising young female fighter in the country while McGuigan, still only 33, has established himself among the world’s best trainers. Her fight against Vaida Masiokaite, a Lithuanian journeywoman who has already had 20 pro bouts, is third on a bill headlined by the grudge match between Liam Williams and Chris Eubank Jr. It is yet another significant boost for women’s boxing that the chief support features Claressa Shields, the formidable American, and will be preceded by Dubois’ highly anticipated entry into the professional ranks.  Boxing is finally back in Britain, after the sport has been in lockdown since Christmas, and female fighters will play a more prominent role than ever in 2022. On 30 April, Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano will headline the first promotion that is likely to make both boxers more than $1m each as they meet at Madison Square Garden. Today we are a long way from New York in an engagingly stark boxing club which adjoins Leyton cricket ground in east London. All nine of McGuigan’s stable of fighters – including the world champion cruiserweight Lawrence Okolie and Caroline’s brother, the heavyweight Daniel Dubois – are here. It is a cold and murky Tuesday but, inside, the gym hums with purpose and resolve. As other fighters stretch, skip or hit the heavy bags dangling from the high ceiling, McGuigan wraps Dubois’ hands with care. She will soon spar with Hannah Rankin, an experienced 31-year-old who recently won the vacant WBA super-welterweight world title. But there is little doubt that the coming star is the prodigiously talented Dubois. When he still worked at the BBC, Mike Costello, the renowned boxing commentator, said: “I’m tempted to call Caroline Dubois the best female boxer I’ve ever seen.” Dubois was only 17 then and, four years on, her confidence is obvious. “Yeah, Hannah is well known,” she says of her sparring partner. “I’ve sparred with her twice before and I did very well against her. It’s important because I’ve been sparring boys and now we do the fine tuning with girls like Hannah.” Dubois’s first senior amateur competition was just last year when she beat the venerable Mira Potkonen who had defeated Taylor at the 2016 Olympic Games. Dubois sealed her own Olympic qualification and travelled to Tokyo last August with high hopes of winning the gold medal. After two convincing victories, she narrowly missed out on a medal when losing a tight decision in the quarter-finals. “I was very upset and angry with myself and I wanted to avenge it [at the Paris Olympics],” Dubois says. “The GB coaches said: ‘Stay with us. It’s not long until 2024.’ But when I came home my dad was like: ‘You won the Youth Olympics and you’ve got a European silver medal and boxed at the Olympics. You’ve done enough as an amateur. Now do your learning as a pro.’ It took some thinking but it was the right choice to turn pro and learn with Shane.” McGuigan helped build the careers of outstanding world champions in Carl Frampton and Josh Taylor, and has a deep and profound knowledge of boxing. He stresses the sheer talent of Dubois while explaining how much she has improved since she joined his gym. “She is super-super-talented but we’ve had to make Caroline aware that this is a high-tempo sport. She’s got all the skill in the world and loves to pick her shots but at the top level you have to work super-hard to draw the lead and the counter. “But I’ve seen a huge improvement since she began training here because they don’t teach technique up there [at the GB National base in Sheffield]. They don’t tell you how to punch properly. Caroline’s right-footed and right-handed. Her base was all wrong and she was spending all the time on the right side. That sets her up for a jab on the right hook, but she had no backhand. Since we’ve changed her stance, she’s getting hit less and she’s hitting a lot harder. I’m super-excited. “The one thing that worried me in the Olympics was that girls were able to push her back and bully her a little. She has done lots of sparring with boys and she needs that pressure. She’s so talented that if she’s not being matched in terms of skill, she feels she can do anything. But it’s different when a physically strong young lad is pushing you back. He’s making it horrible because you’re hitting him with good shots and he is not backing away. “But in sparring they’re using big 14-ounce gloves and he’s wearing a head guard. When she is in the pro ring she will be boxing with eight-ounce gloves and she will hurt her opponents. So it’s important she doesn’t get discouraged because we’re conditioning her to meet the elite in women’s boxing. We’ll start with her challenging for a lightweight title but, if we do it properly and she keeps working hard, I believe she will become a multi-weight world champion.” McGuigan used to train Chantelle Cameron, who is now the WBC and IBF light-welterweight champion. He makes a striking comparison with Dubois. “I worked with Chantelle and she became the IBO lightweight world champion and then we parted ways. But the difference in their skill level is remarkable because Caroline has so much more ability. Chantelle is very tough, durable and determined and she can punch. So can Caroline, but Chantelle joined me as a fully fledged woman. She had been in the GB squad a long time and was in her mid-20s. Caroline’s still only a baby. You don’t usually get that strength until you’ve filled into your physique. “I’m much more excited about training Caroline because I knew every fight Chantelle had was going to be quite hard-fought. Caroline has the skill set to make things easier at the top. Katie Taylor can also make fights easy because she is so skilled. She doesn’t sometimes because Katie loves a tear-up. But, like Katie, Caroline has that X factor, that wow factor. You watch her sparring sometimes and go: ‘Hang on a sec!’ It’s amazing because she’s got so much skill.” Does he expect Dubois to be fighting for a world title in the next two years? “Probably sooner. She genuinely can whack so she’ll get quite a few girls out there early. But it’s about saying: ‘What happens when you’re matched for skill? How do you hold up after six rounds?’ Those four rounds are the ones that win or lose championship fights. If she can get comfortable during the hard fights she will be very special. It’s about conditioning and experience but she’s a clever girl and gets boxing. We’ll know for certain after three or four fights how fast we move.” Dubois says: “I’m learning new stuff every day from Shane and I’m getting fitter and stronger and sharper. For this fight I’ll be pretty good but for the next one I want to get better. And for the one after that I’ll be even better.” On Saturday night she will be boxing before Shield. “It’s going to be crazy and interesting. I’ve never met Claressa so it would be good to see her and have a little chat because she’s a great fighter. You watch so many world champions in female boxing and you’re like: ‘No, they’re not that great.’ But then you get Claressa Shields, Amanda Serrano and Katie Taylor. Those two, Amanda and Katie, will give us a great fight.” Does Dubois also believe that, in a few years, she will fight at this exalted level: “Definitely,” she exclaims, her face lighting up with a dazzling smile. She and McGuigan come from two large and well-known boxing families. Shane’s father, Barry, is the former world champion featherweight who united warring factions in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles in the 1980s. Thirty years later Barry and his three sons set up their own promotional company with Shane, still in his 20s, training Frampton and Taylor to multiple world titles. An acrimonious fallout with those fighters was dwarfed by the death of Shane’s sister, Danika, who was lost to cancer in 2019. “I’m still processing it,” McGuigan says, “because such a loss doesn’t sink in instantly. But you’ve got to enjoy life in the moment. I always used to look ahead and think: ‘In five years I’ll be here, in 10 years I’ll be there.’ I’ve now been in this game 11 years. I’ve had world champions but it’s been a very tough couple of years. If I hadn’t had boxing I’d be in a very bad way.” McGuigan sinks his head against the wall in an empty changing room at the back of the gym. “I just wish I’d had more time with Danika at the end but I had big fights then – like preparing Luke Campbell for Vasyl Lomachenko. I didn’t understand the severity of it all because we lost Danika just five weeks after the diagnosis. I remember coming from the gym and she’d already lapsed into a coma. That’s my only resentment. “Danika had leukaemia when she was a little girl and we all went up and said goodbye to her. Can you imagine saying goodbye to your sister at the age of nine? But she just made an unbelievable turnaround and got better. Since then everything else is a blessing. Losing her at 33, which is now my age, was terrible. But you need to reflect on those amazing memories we had together.” An unconventional background distinguishes the Dubois family because Caroline’s father, Dave, has brought up his seven youngest children largely on his own and often opted for home-schooling. Caroline and three of her brothers, most notably Daniel, attracted interest for their considerable boxing potential only for painful defeats to offer reminders that nothing in life ever runs totally smoothly. After his loss to Joe Joyce in November 2020, when he suffered a worrying eye injury, Daniel is thriving again under McGuigan. Caroline’s enthusiasm, meanwhile, burns inside her just days from her debut. She laughs when I ask her if she has already sorted out the light-hearted stuff like her nickname and ring walk. “I’m probably going for the generic ‘Sweet Caroline’.” Is she actually going to walk out to the old Neil Diamond chestnut that is played at every British boxing promotion? “Oh, I don’t know. I suppose it’s a good song for what it represents. It’s just not on my playlist. My dad is saying I should use it for my debut.” Dubois looks up excitedly when I mention Pernell “Sweet Pea” Whitaker, the master boxer from the 1980s and 90s. “Exactly,” she exclaims. “People who have got good boxing ability are real sweet. But all that matters is going in there and fighting. That’s what I am going to do.”",Sport/Sport,"Caroline Dubois and Shane McGuigan: ‘She has that X factor, that wow factor’",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/02/caroline-dubois-and-shane-mcguigan-she-has-that-x-factor-that-wow-factor-boxing
2/2/2022,"The Six Nations is not just about the rugby. For some the pilgrimages to Europe’s great capitals alongside old friends are the biggest draw, with the match itself a mere bonus. For others it is just as special in their local pub or at home with their extended family. It is this annual wave of communal joy that distinguishes the championship from all the other televisual wallpaper out there. Every now and again, though, the planets align and the quality of the actual games overtakes all else. This year could be one of those classic examples. Consider the runners and riders. Weather permitting, France, Ireland, Scotland and England are all hoping to pose a sharper attacking threat than 12 months ago with Wales, as defending champions, unlikely to retreat into their shells either.  A tournament for the ages, consequently, is a possibility. France have their deepest, most exciting squad in years. Ireland have also just come off an autumn triumph over New Zealand and have some impressive new talent. Scotland, it is generally agreed, have not been better placed in the professional era. England are short of some familiar names but retain mighty ambitions. And last season Wales registered more tries than they have ever scored in a Six Nations campaign. Even Italy are perking up at age-group level, with happier days hopefully ahead. Hence why the 2022 Six Nations is the subject of even greater anticipation than usual. Memories of last year’s fizzing edition remain fresh and, unlike 12 months ago, supporters are back to reboot the tournament’s soul. Even more crucially, the game is changing, with less emphasis on attrition and more on proactive intent. Ruck speed is now the buzz tactical phrase on everyone’s lips. With referees likely to be hotter than ever on teams looking to slow the ball down illegally, it explains why every side has been recalibrating their approach. There was a time, for example, when Ireland simply preferred vice-like efficiency, squeezing and pressurising their opponents and giving them nothing. Increasingly – and credit to Andy Farrell for encouraging it – they want to up the tempo and create more themselves. If Leinster are any guide, they will also be fit enough to make it happen. Will it be Johnny Sexton’s last stand? You suspect the 36-year-old will be desperate to make it count either way. The evocative documentary about Ireland’s great out-halves which aired on Sunday night was a timely reminder of the fine traditions of the green No 10 shirt, from Jackie Kyle and Ollie Campbell to Tony Ward and Ronan O’Gara, and Sexton’s desire still runs as deep as any of them. Along with the most seasoned tactician, the Irish also have the best scrum in the competition. They still, even so, have to go to Paris and London and win. Tick those boxes and a grand slam would surely follow. Slightly more likely is a see-sawing scramble and a three-way title race entering the final straight. Luck will play some part but so will old-fashioned endeavour. Yes, Wales scored plenty of tries but despite finishing bottom of the class for metres made, carries and defenders beaten they still became champions courtesy of a solid scrum and lineout and making more tackles than anyone else. Which is why, above and beyond the specific names on the team sheet, this season’s winners will be the team able to strike the best balance between ambition and the accuracy of their basics. There is now an even greater onus on teams to threaten off first phase and no shortage of magicians – Finn Russell, Marcus Smith, Romain Ntamack – to conjure something gloriously unexpected. Remember Ntamack’s break out from behind his own line against the All Blacks in the autumn? Expect more of it, because teams are realising that striking hard and fast against flat-footed opponents can yield more reward than plodding through 25-plus phases. The 50:22 rule also helps and getting held up over the try line also no longer means an attacking five-metre scrum. It makes smart cross-kicks or quick-witted taps ever more valuable. In that regard, France have the best scrum-half in the world and some of the most lethal finishers. All that is now stopping Les Bleus from becoming an absolute global powerhouse is themselves: inner confidence is very often the difference between a decent side and a great one. Between them, though, Shaun Edwards, Raphaël Ibañez and Fabien Galthié know what a winning culture looks like. France will finish in the top two at least. Poor old injury-hit England? In the end it is less about who plays as how they play. When he axed several of his Saracens stalwarts, Eddie Jones was not only distancing himself from them as individuals but as a collective philosophy. Now the aim is to take the game to the opposition more urgently, with attack coach Martin Gleeson having made a visible difference. If Smith is going to start at 10 – and he surely must – it makes sense to embrace some of Harlequins’ joie de vivre as well. Then again, when did any Six Nations ever unfold precisely to order? It is relatively easy, for instance, to imagine Scotland reaching the last weekend unbeaten, only to fall agonisingly short in Dublin. Ireland’s title prospects would then hinge on the grand finale in Paris between France and England and, potentially, a narrow points difference calculation. Super Saturday?

2/2/2022,"Beleaguered leftwing politicians across Europe will doubtlessly be looking at last weekend’s general elections in Portugal and taking notes. In a surprise outcome, the centre-left Socialist party (PS) won a historic absolute majority, taking 117 of the 230 seats in parliament. Despite polls on the eve of the election suggesting that there would be a possible tie, the centre-right opposition party, the PSD, was routed. The political map in Portugal is now painted almost entirely red. Portugal is something of a European outlier. Its economic recovery from the crises of the early 2010s was praised worldwide, with growth at one point exceeding the eurozone average. While most countries in Europe struggled to keep their coronavirus infections under control, it was becoming a world leader in terms of vaccinations – almost 90% of the population is double-jabbed. And, unlike other countries that elected leftwing governments in 2015, Portugal has enjoyed political stability, with the Socialists at the helm ever since.  So what did last weekend’s results tell us? On the right, there has been a splintering of affiliations between the weakened veteran PSD; the far-right Chega (meaning: Enough); and the freshly minted, pro-business Liberal Initiative (IL). For the first time in Portugal’s modern democratic history, the rightwing Christian Democrats, once the third largest party in parliament, did not return a single MP. On the left the house won big, with António Costa, the prime minister, cannibalising much of the usually more radical electorate, leaving only morsels for the likes of the Communist party and the anticapitalist Left Bloc. One lesson from these results is that the painful austerity years after the 2008 banking crisis have not been forgotten. For the centre-right PSD, in government at the time, this is still a cross to bear. Its attempt to tactically appeal to the left at times did not work. Portugal is a country where the left still has strong roots in ordinary people’s lives, where trade unions rally behind the Communist party and millennials rally behind eco-socialist forces, meaning “working-class conservatism” doesn’t have much traction. For social democrats and soft socialists such as Costa, this was a particularly sweet victory, given the circumstances. The PS had been in power since 2015, but it was hampered by the politicking that comes with minority government – depending officially or in practice on an agreement with the far left. So when the Communists and the Left Bloc started grumbling last year over levels of public investment at a time of social crisis, Costa knew this was his chance to go for broke. He could lose it all, but he could also win big and ditch his radical hangers-on. After six years of yearning, the prime minister got his wish. There may indeed be a lesson there for sister parties across Europe. The Labour party under Keir Starmer, for instance, could learn something from Costa about cooperating with the far left, at least until electoral victory is assured. For the communists and radicals, the election was a harsh learning experience. They discovered that you can cooperate with the centre to gain power, but once there, you need to carve out a distinct identity, which they failed to do – and ended up paying the price. But the gravest lesson from these elections concerns the creeping success of the far right. The third largest political force in Portugal – a country with a proud antifascist history, where the dictatorship was toppled in a bloodless socialist revolution in 1974 – is now the Chega. It returned one loudmouthed and churlish MP in 2019. When parliament returns in mid-February, it will have a group of 12. That’s a dozen lawmakers representing a party whose leader has repeatedly sought to demonise the Roma minority and whose representatives have been associated with nostalgia for the Salazar dictatorship and have a record of making inflammatory comments relating to race. It’s an age-old lesson, really. Any oxygen given to the far right is dangerous. The normalisation of a far-right discourse through national television, daily newspapers and by the commentariat, even if for the sake of contradicting talking points, often only serves to lend momentum. In a country that nearly 50 years ago stamped the far right out of power, it is particularly chastening and disturbing to see its modern-day equivalents return to the São Bento palace, where parliament sits. For all the sweet relief that the Socialist party may be feeling, the rise of Chega is a reminder that complacency is never an option.

2/2/2022,"Vodafone’s chief executive has confirmed he is in talks with rivals in its biggest markets to strike deals with “speed and resolve”, as the telecoms company seeks to respond to calls for a business shake-up from the new activist investor Cevian. Nick Read, who has argued that the European telecoms industry must consolidate to create more profitable businesses that are more attractive to investors, confirmed the mobile operator was speaking to rivals in the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain.  The chief executive has struck 19 deals since being appointed chief executive three years ago, a tempo that he said he intended to keep up, in his first comments since Europe’s largest activist shareholder was revealed to have taken a stake in Vodafone. “There has been media speculation about merger and acquisition activity in specific European markets,” said Read. “We feel the UK needs to consolidate to give [us] industrial scale so we can improve returns. “We are active on a number of fronts and seeing good engagement from our counterparties, which confirms that we have a series of potential opportunities to shape the business with stronger assets in healthier markets and unlock value for our shareholders. We are approaching consolidation with speed and resolve.” Vodafone has been linked with a string of potential deals including a takeover or merger with Three UK as well as counterparts in Germany, Spain and Italy. “I look at markets where I see a strong case for consolidation without the need for punitive remedies, Those markets [are] Spain, Italy, the UK and now Portugal. Those four markets are the largest opportunity with a good and solid rationale,” he said. “We are engaged with multiple parties in multiple markets. We will remain open-minded and pragmatic to work through the opportunities at pace.” Vodafone also controls 82% of Vantage Towers, its European mobile tower network floated last year, which Read confirmed was in talks with similar businesses owned by Germany’s Deutsche Telekom and France’s Orange. “Bringing that combination together would make a European champion in towers. That would underpin infrastructure for the digital decade Europe wants to achieve,” he said. Swedish-headquartered Cevian, known for taking longer-term positions to turn around businesses without taking aggressive action, is seeking a consolidation of the sprawling £34bn Vodafone empire to focus on its most profitable markets and inject more telecoms experience at board level. “We do not comment on who is on our share register if it is not at a disclosable level,” he said. “But we have a regular dialogue with our large and small shareholders. I have looked at speculation [about what Cevian wants], to me everyone is confirming we are doing the right things.” Vodafone’s shares rose almost 3% in early trading on Wednesday as investors warmed to the company’s mostly positive results, during which the company added 152,000 customers in the UK and reached almost 1 million fixed broadband customers, as its business benefited from Black Friday and strong iPhone sales. The company will receive a revenue boost this year from the return of roaming charges for British travellers heading to Europe.",News/Business,Vodafone confirms consolidation talks with European rivals,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/02/vodafone-confirms-consolidation-talks-european-rivals-takeover-merger
2/2/2022,"Cookies are one of the many questionable pacts we have made online, where privacy is exchanged for convenience without being entirely sure about the consequences. As with so many arrangements involving our data, this deal is being rewritten under the gaze of regulators. Last week Google issued an update on how it is replacing cookies on its Chrome browser, which is important because two-thirds of web browsing around the world is on Chrome.  Put simply, a cookie is a text file that is dropped into your browser by a website when you visit it. In the UK and EU, you are asked to consent to multiple cookies when you click on a site (and yes it’s worth checking just how many cookies you agree to take on when you give your consent). The new head of the UK’s data watchdog, John Edwards, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme last week – on international data privacy day – that he is no fan of the consent-clicking process. “That’s not a very effective way of rebalancing the power relationship between consumers and companies that profit from consumers’ data,” he said. Cookie monsters Cookies identify individual users so the website can record all kinds of things about your activity. Some of this info is helpful, like whether you have logged in to the site before, so you don’t have to constantly enter your user name and password every time you visit in the future. This sort of thing is known as a first party cookie. However, there are types of this technology known as third party cookies that facilitate the storing of information (like your browsing history and your location) by commercial partners – often marketing or advertising businesses – that might make you slightly more uncomfortable. If you check the cookie consent box on any website, you will be surprised at the number of advertising and marketing-related cookies. Third party cookies, through agreements with multiple publishers and websites, are able to create a profile of individual users and serve targeted adverts to you while you browse across multiple websites. Like other news publishers, the Guardian asks readers if it can use cookies, for purposes such as measuring how often readers visit and use our site, and showing readers personalised ads. In what appears to be a win for privacy advocates and a blow to publishers, advertisers and the intermediaries that facilitate personalised ads across the web, third party cookies are being phased out across the board. This is in part due to pressure from regulators and pro-privacy laws like GDPR. Apple and Mozilla have blocked third party cookies on their Safari and Firefox browsers and Google is doing the same on Chrome by 2023. Leaving the FLoC behind Google is replacing third party cookies with a set of technologies called a privacy sandbox and last week it announced it was changing one of the key proposals. The initial plan was to bundle people into groups (cohorts) with similar interests based on their browsing habits and allow advertisers to serve ads to those groups. This was called FLoC, for Federated Learning of Cohorts. After feedback from the industry, which included warnings that individuals could still be identified as they browsed across the web under the FLoC system, Google is now proposing a different system. It is called Topics, in which the Chrome browser notes your top interests for that week based on your browsing history and registers them in the browser (like a cookie would) under broad categories like “fitness” or “travel”, which are limited in number. Advertisers and publishers are able to access this data via a browser API, which is a feed of information that they can tap into. Then when users visit a site that has signed up to the system, three of the user’s “topics” of interest are shared with the site and its advertisers, allowing the site to serve ads that reflect the user’s interest in, for instance, rock music or cars. Google said the topics will not include sensitive categories such as gender or race and the system will allow users to see the topics, remove any they don’t like or disable the feature completely. The topics are deleted every three weeks. In the UK the Competition and Markets Authority and the Information Commissioner’s Office are looking at the proposals, from a competition and privacy perspective (ie are there disadvantages for Google’s rivals in provision of online adverts and will users’ data be abused). Rivals are also concerned that Google, which has said other parts of its business like YouTube will adhere to these changes, still has a basic advantage through the sheer amount of existing data it has on users. Vinay Goel, the Google product director in charge of the sandbox project, says: “We have developed these new proposals in the open, seeking feedback at every step to ensure that they work for everyone, without preferential treatment or advantage to Google’s advertising products or to Google’s own sites.” According to the Open Rights Group, which campaigns for people’s digital rights, Google’s new proposals signal an end to the data gold rush under third party cookies. “Conducting behavioural profiling in the browser could constitute an alternative to the existing data-free-for-all model, where your browsing activities are broadcasted to thousands of unknown intermediaries,” says Mariano delli Santi, legal and policy officer at ORG. However, the ORG remains concerned over several issues including the lack of a default opt-in stance, which would see a browser omitted from the scheme unless they chose to be included. This is still behavioural profiling, says the ORG. Goel adds: “We started the Privacy Sandbox initiative to improve web privacy for users, and Topics will allow for users to have greater control over relevant ads without sharing sensitive details such as gender or race.” Nobody’s happy – so everybody wins It is a big change for the digital advertising industry. Farhad Divecha, managing director of UK digital marketing agency Accuracast, wonders if the shift will satisfy anyone. “Privacy advocates are going to feel that this is still not quite enough, because there’s reasons why this is still tracking behaviour. And on the flip side, advertisers are going to say you’re taking away stuff from me. And you’re taking away my ability to target specifically whom I want to be reaching.” Paul Banister, chief strategy officer at US digital ad management firm Cafe Media, says the momentum nonetheless is with privacy. “I think the pendulum has swung pretty far towards privacy here.” But he adds: “because it’s easier to understand the topics system, hopefully it will be more something that users feel good about. And if users are happier with the outcome that is better for advertisers, because it makes people more supportive of what their data is being used for.” This could be just the beginning – as internet users become more aware of that trade off between privacy and convenience, and regulators continue to challenge the marketing industry upon which much of big tech profits rely, the pendulum could swing further.

2/2/2022,"My friend Robin Le Mesurier, who has died aged 68 from cancer, was a rock guitarist best known for his work with Sir Rod Stewart and the French actor and singer Johnny Hallyday. The son of two of Britain’s most well-known actors, John Le Mesurier and Hattie Jacques, Robin described his 1960s childhood in his birthplace of Earl’s Court, London, as “charmed, bohemian but also chaotic”. Woken up in the middle of the night by the likes of Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers, as well as various jazz musicians jamming loudly in the house, didn’t seem out of the ordinary. “To me, visitors such as Kenneth Williams, Joan Sims and Harry Secombe were just friends and colleagues of Mum and Dad,” he said.  Schooldays were not his happiest: he attended Sussex House prep school in London, where he described himself as being “completely out of place”, and then Westminster City grammar school, where he was bullied for having a famous mother. Given his first guitar at the age of nine, he cut his first single for EMI at the age of 16, and was then offered a place at the Royal College of Music. But the lure of rock’n’roll won out over classical music. His first band, Reign, opened for bands such as Genesis and the Kinks, and for a year in the 70s he became a Womble – until a drugs bust ended his career as the furry Wellington. Robin’s next band, Air Supply, was booked as support for Rod Stewart’s US tour in 1977, and his guitar-playing made such an impression on Stewart that in 1981 he was asked to join his band – a move that led him to settle permanently in Los Angeles. “I’ve had many wonderful and creative guitarists in my band, but Robin was always just a cut above,” said Stewart. “He was a beautiful, soulful lead, driving rhythms like a locomotive, and an unforgettable stage presence.” From 1994 Robin worked with Hallyday, becoming his musical director until Hallyday’s death in 2017. Robin was also a founder member, with Bernie Taupin and the guitarist Jim Cregan, of the band Farm Dogs. I got to know Robin while working with him on his autobiography, and despite a history of rock’n’roll antics in which hotel rooms were trashed and copious amounts of drugs and drink were taken, he possessed a gentle, dry wit, and remained the sweetest and politest of men. His good manners were instilled in him from an early age by his parents, and were there with him always. I was with Robin one day when we went to see Hallyday in Los Angeles. They had known each other for 20 years and described themselves as “brothers”. Yet when we arrived ten minutes before our appointed time, Robin insisted that we stay in the car as “it would be impolite to arrive early”. Robin is survived by his wife, Jules, whom he married in 1999.",Arts/Music,Robin Le Mesurier obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/feb/02/robin-le-mesurier-obituary

2/2/2022,"Gabriel Byrne’s 2020 book Walking With Ghosts covers common territory for an actor’s memoir, recalling entranced first trips to the cinema, personal encounters with heavyweight movie stars and waiting in the wings on Broadway. Its arc, too, is familiar: rags to riches to ruinous addiction – in this case to alcohol at the height of his 90s fame. What sets the book apart is Byrne’s evocative and elegiac, often sensuous prose, particularly when detailing his childhood and what his father called the “theatre of the street” unfolding daily in his Dublin neighbourhood. This theatrical performance based on the memoir brings Byrne back to the Dublin stage for the first time since 1978, when he appeared at the Gaiety in Brendan Behan’s Borstal Boy. Behan himself passes through – seen on a bus by four-year-old Byrne – and Byrne also imitates his idol, Richard Burton, who he starred alongside in a TV miniseries about Wagner.  But Byrne’s aim is not to share trivia about The Usual Suspects or Miller’s Crossing or any of the Hollywood thrillers that boasted his glowering but crumpled presence, with the glint in his eye often as sharp as his suits. It’s not that he’s short of colour – this is a guy who played Satan on a millennium’s eve rampage in New York opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in End of Days. Instead Byrne is here to offer thumbnail sketches of the ghosts – whether family, friends or the long-gone film icons of his childhood – who have stayed with the actor into his eighth decade. The book interweaves episodes from across Byrne’s life, many lines using the familiar “I remember” creative-writing prompt. If the memoir reinforces the notion that we never shake off our childhood self, and that memories can be unresolvable, that impressionistic approach has been ironed out for this show, directed by Lonny Price and presented by Landmark Productions and Lovano. The result never quite captivates like the book. It has a more chronological timeline, and there is a rather straightforward sound design by Sinéad Diskin typified by waves and gulls for Byrne’s journey across the Irish sea to enter an English seminary aged 11. Against the gilded concentric frames of Sinéad McKenna’s elegant set, Byrne moves from desk to bench to bar stool to recount and enact episodes. The humour is often gentle but sometimes overegged: a neighbour with “new teeth like a row of fridges” is glimpsed memorably on the page but that simile is less vivid when the woman is also imitated. Byrne is a beautiful writer and some of the other details he conjures need space to linger. But he is also a wonderful physical comedian, evoking another neighbour whose gait resembled treading on mattresses. Most powerfully, Byrne affectionately adopts the voices of his mother and father, who provide the show with its best one-liners. He was the eldest of six children: how did they ever fit into the ramshackle home, he wonders, and later recalls the sensation of stepping for the first time on to carpet when he visits a fancy hotel with his mum. He is adept at capturing the constant bewilderments of childhood, artfully blurring it into a befuddlement of older age. The puzzles of a religious youth are particularly well drawn. (On the sacrament: how does God get into the wafer? And does he come out in your number two?) That blend of curiosity and confusion is a constant. Was this really me, Byrne seems to ask. Are these memories mine? There are other constants throughout his life: shame, isolation, worthlessness but also a benevolence that even sees him pity, while not forgive, the priest who abused him as a child when he tracks him down in later life. Byrne finds a sense of belonging – after stints as a plumber and a dishwasher – through the theatre, depicting the warmth while also puncturing the pomposity he encounters in his first forays into am-dram. The memoir recounted his first romances but the grand passion in this stage version is, fittingly, for acting itself. As he recreates his first cinema trip with his grandmother, we see laughter, fear and above all bliss spread across his face and he is a child again. At the Gaiety theatre, Dublin, until 6 February.

2/2/2022,"Exposure to a single nasal droplet is sufficient to become infected with Covid-19, according to a landmark trial in which healthy volunteers were intentionally given a dose of the virus. The trial, the first to have monitored people during the entire course of infection, also found that people typically develop symptoms very quickly – on average, within two days of encountering the virus – and are most infectious five days into the infection. The study was carried out using a strain of the virus before the Alpha, Delta and Omicron variants emerged.  The trial’s chief investigator, Prof Christopher Chiu, of Imperial College London, said: “Our study reveals some very interesting clinical insights, particularly around the short incubation period of the virus, extremely high viral shedding from the nose, as well as the utility of lateral flow tests, with potential implications for public health.” The findings, published on Springer Nature’s pre-print server, and which have not yet been peer-reviewed, detail the outcomes in 36 healthy, young participants with no immunity to the virus. The volunteers were monitored at a specialist unit at the Royal Free hospital in London, and experienced no severe symptoms. The study found that the infection first appears in the throat and that infectious virus peaks about five days into infection, by which point the nose has a much higher viral load than the throat. The study also suggested that lateral flow tests are a reassuringly reliable indicator of whether infectious virus is present. Swabbing the nose and throat makes it more likely to detect infections during the first few days, the work suggests. “We found that overall, lateral flow tests correlate very well with the presence of infectious virus,” said Chiu. “Even though in the first day or two they may be less sensitive, if you use them correctly and repeatedly, and act on them if they read positive, this will have a major impact on interrupting viral spread.” The team say the trial paves the way for future challenge studies that could help accelerate the development of the next generation of vaccines and antiviral drugs. Prof Sir Jonathan Van-Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, said: “Scientifically, these studies offer real advantage because the timing of exposure to the virus is always known exactly, therefore things like the interval between exposure and the profile of virus shedding can be accurately described. This important study has provided further key data on Covid-19 and how it spreads, which is invaluable in learning more about this novel virus, so we can fine-tune our response.”",News/World news,Exposure to one nasal droplet enough for Covid infection – study,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/02/exposure-to-one-nasal-droplet-enough-for-covid-infection-study
2/2/2022,"My friend Min Marks, who has died aged 100, was a communist activist and wartime Bletchley Park associate. She and her husband, Jack, were associated with virtually every peace movement, anti-racism and anti-fascist campaign in Leeds for more than 70 years. Despite her sturdy communist affiliations, Min was ecumenical in her attitude to political campaigns, happily working with all who shared the objective in view. She and Jack were essentially secular Jews and their support of the Palestinian cause inevitably brought difficulties with some members of the Leeds Jewish community. Min also cultivated a wide array of friends and was a convivial host.  She was born in Leeds, to Isaac Druyan, a presser, and his second wife, Rachel (nee Israel), and attended Allerton high school in the city. During the second world war Min volunteered for the ATS (Auxiliary Territorial Service) and became an intercept operator, taking down encrypted German morse code messages that were then sent to Bletchley Park to be decoded. She is included on the roll of honour there, and is also commemorated on its “codebreakers’ wall”. She became highly skilled at morse code and retained the ability to read it until late in life. Min married Jack in Leeds in 1946 and thereafter they were both active in the city’s Young Communist League. Unlike a number of Leeds party colleagues, they remained in the Communist Party of Great Britain following the Soviet regime’s crushing of the Hungarian party’s revolt against the rigidity of Stalinist control, saying that the communist cause was more important than any individual’s deviation from it. Min deplored the UK party’s 1991 decision to disband, and she and Jack then put their efforts into supporting the Communist party’s daily newspaper, the Morning Star, which had been able to continue independently. Min worked for many years for the social and market research company RSL as an interviewer, trainer and area supervisor, only retiring when she was well into her 70s. She was also a fundraiser for a number of charities, particularly the Yorkshire PHAB (Physically Handicapped and Able Bodied), who put her and Jack’s names on one of their PHAB minibuses. Jack died in 2017.

2/2/2022,"My father, Ian Robertson, who has died aged 85, was a passionate educator, family man and raconteur. Eleven years after qualifying as a teacher he became principal lecturer in chemistry at Jordanhill College of Education in Glasgow and soon after that a Scottish schools inspector, becoming the national specialist for chemistry. Widely published, he worked tirelessly to improve primary and secondary education in Scotland. Bombing, dogfights and V1 bombs marked his early years in Sheerness on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. The son of Donald, a glass factory manager and veteran of both world wars, and Vera (nee Neame), a nurse and housewife, Ian moved with his family to Fife in 1945, where he pestered the local fishermen to teach him what they knew. In his wee boat, the MYOB (Mind Your Own Business), he caught mackerel; while at school at George Watson’s college in Edinburgh, he started fly-fishing. From the Tweed, he went on to summers as a gillie on the Oykel, earning enough to run his first car.  The passion for fishing almost derailed his academic career, though, surprising many, he gained a degree in chemistry at Edinburgh University in 1958. University led to teaching, radical politics, and Phyl Cameron, a fellow student, whom he married in April 1959. A week later Ian began his first job, at Ross High in the mining town of Tranent, east of Edinburgh. His teaching style, white rat on shoulder, was highly successful; he absolutely refused to use corporal punishment and believed anyone could learn. They did. Four years later he became principal teacher in chemistry at Madras college in St Andrews. There, he piloted a new approach to teaching the subject; the endless hours paid off, with his pupils coming 1st, 2nd and 4th out of 600 entrants in that year’s O-Grade chemistry. He worked for the Scottish Examination Board, delivered in-service chemistry courses for teachers, was the Scottish representative on the council of the Association for Science Education, chair of the Education Research Committee, and sat on the British Committee in Chemical Education. In 1967 he won a year-long Shell fellowship to University College London, decamping with the family to London. In 1970 he was appointed to Jordanhill College of Education (now part of the University of Strathclyde); then joined HM Scottish Schools Inspectorate in 1974, becoming district inspector for Glasgow in 1980 and eventually staff inspector for the Borders, Dumfries and Galloway in 1990. Alongside his work, he built a dinghy, walked and talked with Phyl and their German shepherd dogs, bred Siamese cats, puppy-walked for Guide Dogs, laboured on refugee housing in Austria, and took his entire family camping to Russia. After a brush with cancer in 1996, he retired. A lifetime blood donor, passionate gardener, art enthusiast and family historian, he persecuted his children with the Guardian quick crossword, doing it every day until his death, and was fiendishly good at sudoku puzzles. He tirelessly cared for Phyl until her death from dementia in 2020. He is survived by his children, Kate, Peter and me, and by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",News/Education,Ian Robertson obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/02/ian-robertson-obituary

Prema was sister to Molly and Mon, and went to All Saints girls’ boarding school in Nainital, in the foothills of the Himalayas, where she was taught by missionaries.  The family moved to Mombasa, Kenya, in 1956 when her father became regional manager, eastern Africa, at the Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council. Prema then attended Kenya high school for girls in Nairobi when the family moved to the capital, later gaining a degree in fine art from University College, Nairobi. In 1966, her beloved father was killed in a car accident. The whole family was in the car. This had a lasting impact on Prema’s outlook on life, causing an underlying anxiety that a similar fate would befall those she loved. Despite this, and with the help of my father, she never let it hold her children back. She would remind us of our culture, but also encourage us to assimilate to life in the UK while we were growing up. In the 70s, Prema taught fine art and English in Nairobi to boys many of whom ran over long distances to get to school. In later years, she would comment while watching the Olympics that she had taught grammar to some of the Kenyan athletes. She met Thomas Varughese in Nairobi in 1972, and they married that year. Perhaps it was destiny as there was only one character difference in their Morris Minor number plates. In 1979, when my sister, Mohini, was five and I was three, we moved to Croydon in south London. Prema stepped off the aeroplane in a sari and thin cardigan to be greeted by cold, rainy April weather. From around 1980 until 1987, she started working at a heraldry company where she researched, created and illustrated family coats of arms. Her love of art pervaded all parts of her life. She excelled in still life and botanical painting and drawing, as well as painting landscapes inspired by her travels abroad. Family was everything to Mum. She treated my sister’s husband, Jason, and my husband, Justin, like her own sons. Her cooking was at the centre of every family feast and was one of the ways she showed her love. For her last birthday, the grandchildren secretly collated and illustrated all of Mum’s famous recipes as a printed book: Ammi’s Yummy Recipes, Made With Love. Her artistic talent was also realised in the beauty of her garden – she would spend hours each day tending to it, carefully considering the planting, colour palette and textures. Prema is survived by Thomas, Mohini and me, and her grandchildren, Sachin, Ashwin, Anjali and Mani.",News/Education,Elizabeth Varughese obituary,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/feb/02/elizabeth-varughese-obituary
2/2/2022,"Was he garrulous? Did he wear a topcoat? Did he hanker after renown? Such questions we ask ourselves about the deceased great, trying in our forlorn way to identify with them, some point of contact, some malady, some caprice that brings us and them closer. Such questions are not satisfactorily answered in works of fiction, writers being by necessity conjurors, ex-lovers are unreliable, friends overreaching, enemies bilious, so the closest we can get to a legendary figure is from letters. Letters are like the lines on a face, testimonial. In this case they are the access to the man that encased the mind, which housed the genius of James Joyce. In his youth he was suspicious, contemptuous, unaccommodating. He saw his countrymen as being made up of yahoos, adulterous priests and sly deceitful women. He classed it as “the venereal condition of the Irish”. Like the wild geese he had a mind to go elsewhere. He wanted to be continentalised. He liked the vineyards. He had a dream of Paris, and a craze for languages. In literature his heroes were Cardinal Newman and Henrik Ibsen. To Ibsen he wrote, “Your work on Earth draws to a close and you are near the silence. It is growing dark for you.” He was 19 at that time. Young men do not usually know such things unless there is already on them the shadow of their future. There was on him. He descended into blindness. He was beset by glaucoma, cataract, iris complaint, dissolution of the retina. He is said to have had 25 eye operations. His nerves were like the twitterings of wrens. His brain pandemoniacal as he resorted to aspirin, iodine, scopolamine.  Religious motifs may have dogged him and Latin words and hades and Potsdam and melancolores and Atrahora and the Portuguese for devil but he remained a plain-spoken man. In a tart and almost vulnerable rejoinder he was driven to point out to his aunt that receiving a copy of Ulysses was not like receiving a pound of chops and he urged her to seize it back from whatever hooligan had swizzled her out of it, under the name of borrowing. His mind was forever computing. In the next letter, or the letter following, he plied her with questions. Had such and such a house ivy on its seafront wall, how many steps were there down to the sea, could a man climb over a certain railing into Eccles Street without injuring himself. To him words were not only literature but numerals, digits, things that when he strung them together in his wild, prodigious way, took on another light, another lustre, and were the litany of his lapsed Catholic soul. He liked hymnbooks and tittle-tattle and all tongues to be welded in together. The English he strove for was pidgin, cockney, Irish, Bowery, mythological and biblical. To avoid being cloying, or run the risk of being literary he always prefaced his incandescent phrases with a joke. When asking Italo Svevo to collect a briefcase, he first described it with surgical accuracy, its oilskin cloth, the approximate weight, the approximate measurement and the protrusion which struck him as having a likeness to a nun’s belly. Then he added, “In this briefcase I placed the written symbols of the languid lights which occasionally flashed across my soul.” Only by giving a pedestrian complexion to the whole thing could he communicate his real feeling, his depth. Love! Love makes dotards of us all. It is a solace to know that he sublimely fell into those traps. No detachment, no grand phrases but raging boiling lust and suspiciousness and doubt. His love object, and a lasting one, Nora Barnacle, was from Galway, the city of his tribal name. They left “Stepmother Eireann” in October 1904 to embark on a life of penury, obstacle and adventure. Their first stop was the naval city of Pola, where Joyce taught in a Berlitz school, revelled in the milieu of several languages, and regularly held court in the taverns. Meanwhile, in some rented room, sick for home, Nora moped, was ridiculed by his co-professors, often threatening to leave him, yet never did. On a brief visit to Dublin, with the ludicrous intention of opening a cinema, Joyce’s passion for Nora was reignited and set down in a torrent of intemperate letters. Could he be smacked by her, or better still flogged? Could he be her child? Could she be his mother? Desire and shame, shame and desire. His own words for his own feelings were that they were mad and dirty. He attended to his own talent, not in the interest of bombast or self-aggrandisement, but rather like a faithful watchman. He had the fixity of the great and therefore no need of vanity. He estimated that three shillings would be a reasonable price for Ulysses. A tiresome book, he admitted. At the same time he was dogged by fear that the printing house would be burnt down or that some untoward catastrophe would happen. He assisted Miss Beach in wrapping the copies, he autographed the deluxe editions, he wrote to influential people, he hawked packages to the post office. He knew that the illustrati would change their minds many a time before settling down to a final opinion and that many another would know as much about it as the parliamentary side of his arse. It was for the safety and wellbeing of his family that his profound heart was laid bare. He had two children, Giorgio and Lucia, and believed that some mysterious malady had befallen them when they were small. Lucia wanted to be a dancer and then an illustrator, but did not succeed at either. Fathers and daughters. That clandestine clench. In her 20s, she felt a failure. First apathy, then slithering into speech that echoed the “baulkspeech” of Finnegans Wake, so that he named her his “Inspiratrice”. She became violent, especially towards her mother. Finally the specialists and doctors persuaded him that she had passed the line of demarcation and would have to be put in some institution. She hated her incarcerations, said Jung was a fat man, trying to steal her soul, set fire to several of these premises, whereupon Joyce and Nora had to find another sanatorium in Austria or Germany or Switzerland. Joyce, who built constellations through language, was helpless to cure her. Towards the end of his life there came a thaw, a melting. He was bowed to, at the opera. But it was not fame that caused him to mellow so, surely it was growth. He called on people, sent greetings, telegrams, entertained guests with his clear tenor tones. He sent Yeats an autographed copy of Work in Progress and said that if Mrs Yeats cared to unsew the first pages of Ulysses he would happily sign it for them. He sent Pomes Penyeach to the library at Galway University. They had a special reading desk made and he was delighted that his book, with Lucia’s letterings, was on display for all the ex-hooligans to see. He had come to a height. When war broke out, Joyce and Nora had to leave Paris for neutral Switzerland. The undertaking had in it all the bungle and grinding perversity of a Kafka fable. Worse, he could not, though he tried indefatigably, secure a permit for Lucia’s release from a Maison de Santé in Brittany. A lonely figure with an eye patch in a long overcoat, he was to be seen walking around sidestreets in Zurich with a stick, stones in his pocket to drive off marauding dogs. Finiche. No more. A fadograph of yesteryear. In January, he was struck down with pains that could only be relieved by morphine and next day, writhing like a fish, he was carried to the Red Cross hospital. There he was diagnosed with a perforated duodenal ulcer that had been his undiagnosed companion for years and was operated upon immediately. Later, transfusions of blood were supplied by two soldiers from Neuchâtel, a region known for the wine he had so frequently relished. Nora was advised to go back to their lodgings, believing the worst was over. He was just bordering on 60. After some few hours, he fell into a coma and died. It was 13 January 1941 – 13 being a number that he had always regarded as unsuitable for travel. It is hard not to believe in immortality, considering the untimely death of dear Mr Joyce.
