2/12/2022,"Former Trump White House communications director Alyssa Farah says her father boycotted her wedding over her criticism of the former president, who she blamed for inciting the deadly U.S. Capitol riot. On Friday’s broadcast of “The View,” Farah said her conservative figure father Joseph and her step-mother refused to attend her nuptials in November because of “political differences after I spoke out against President Trump.” Farah resigned from her role in December 2020, a month after Trump’s loss to rival Joe Biden which the ex-president has never officially accepted. “After three and a half incredible years, I will be leaving the White House to pursue new opportunities,” Farah said at the time. “I am deeply proud of the incredible things we were able to accomplish to make our country stronger, safer and more secure.” Her tone on Trump changed following the Jan. 6 insurrection, however, which earned her the cold shoulder from her own dad. “The answer was simple,” said Farah, who also served as a spokesperson for the Pentagon and former Vice President Mike Pence. “Like, I love them. They were welcome to be there on my end. But if they didn’t want to be there, why would I interrupt my special day by trying to have them there?” Asked if her father was in the MAGA “cult,” Farah replied: “Unfortunately. I mean, listen, the MAGA strength runs really far and deep.” But, “I enjoyed my wedding,” she added. “I got to be with my new family.” Should toxic family members be banned from weddings? #TheView co-hosts and guest co-host @Alyssafarah Griffin weigh in. https://t.co/cVclFZyKV0pic.twitter.com/2wZLraAEks — The View (@TheView) February 12, 2022 This article originally appeared on HuffPost and has been updated.

2/12/2022,"Manchin and Rubio announced the PIPES Act, a bipartisan bill, in a press release on Friday. It comes after the announcement of a federal grant for harm reduction services related to drug use. Earlier this week, the White House and HHS denied the funding would go towards crack pipes. Sens. Joe Manchin and Marco Rubio introduced a bipartisan bill on Friday that would block federal funds from being used to buy and distribute tools used to take drugs, like crack pipes and syringes. The Preventing Illicit Paraphernalia for Exchange Systems Act, or PIPES Act, was announced by Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, and Rubio, a Republican from Florida, in a press release. ""Every American and West Virginian has been impacted by the drug epidemic that has killed over 101,000 Americans from April 2020 to April 2021,"" Manchin said. ""While this is a heartbreaking issue that must be fully addressed by the federal government, using taxpayer funds to buy paraphernalia for those struggling with substance use disorder is not the solution."" ""Everyone knows someone who has struggled with addiction, and unfortunately, many have lost a loved one from the disease,"" Rubio said, adding: ""We need to do more, but sending drug paraphernalia to addicts is not the answer."" The PIPES Act would ban federal funds from being used to buy needles or syringes for the injection of an illegal substance, the press release said. It also said there would be an exception in the case of ""a significant risk of hepatitis infection or HIV outbreak due to injection drug use."" The bill also maintains federal funds can't be used to buy or distribute pipes used for smoking illegal drugs. The bill comes after the Department of Health and Human Services announced in December a $30 million grant for harm reduction services that focuses on preventing overdose deaths and reducing health risks associated with drug use. Such services include providing sterile syringes, safe-smoking kits, and overdose-prevention kits. Fox News seized on the grant this week, with hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity pushing the claim that taxpayer dollars were being used to buy crack pipes. White House press secretary Jen Psaki responded on Wednesday, telling reporters crack pipes were ""never a part"" of the safe smoking kits. She said such kits may include ""alcohol swabs, lip balm, other materials to promote hygiene and reduce the transmission of diseases like HIV and hepatitis."" HHS also issued a statement Wednesday that said: ""No federal funding will be used directly or through subsequent reimbursement of grantees to put pipes in safe smoking kits."" Prior to introducing the PIPES Act, Manchin and other senators also sent a letter to HHS on Thursday asking about the grant program. The letter states that some harm reduction groups include pipes in their safe smoking kits, citing two Canada-based groups, Toward the Heart and Interior Health. It also said the HHS grant does not explicitly prohibit the funds from being used on pipes. HHS did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.

2/12/2022,"Donald Trump was so “mind-numbingly incompetent” about protecting classified information that White House staffers were “legitimately scared” about ever turning it over to him, a former Trump administration official said on MSNBC’s “Deadline White House” Friday. “It’s not just that he criticized [Hillary] Clinton and then did something similar. He did something vastly worse on multiple occasions, so much so that we were scared — legitimately scared — to take sensitive classified information into the Oval Office and tell the president of the United States about it,” said Miles Taylor, who served as chief of staff to the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “That’s how bad it was,” he added. “We would talk about it before we would go in when we got certain briefs — can we talk to the president about this? — because there was a worry he would leak information to the public, to foreign adversaries.” At one point, as Trump sat among a group of reporters, “he had classified information on his desk, and he grabbed it and held it up and waved it in the air to brag about how he gets really important information,” Taylor recalled. “I mean, our jaws hit the floor.” There was a also photographer in the room at the time, said Taylor. Fortunately, the journalists “didn’t capture the highly sensitive classified information that Donald Trump grabbed with his fist and waved in the air. But that’s how reckless this man was with that type of information,” he added. Taylor painted the horrifying picture after he was asked how Trump’s treatment of important information compared to Clinton’s. Trump viciously attacked Clinton during his first campaign for president for using a private email server for work while she was secretary of state. Her behavior was so egregious, an outraged Trump claimed, that she should have been “locked up.” She was cleared of any wrongdoing. Trump repeatedly ripped up documents while he was in the Oval Office in apparent brazen violation of the Presidential Records Acts requiring that they be saved. He also absconded with several boxes of documents — including information marked “classified” — when he left the White House. Check out the full interview with Taylor in the video clip up top.
