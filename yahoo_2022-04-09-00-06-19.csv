4/9/2022,"As the second quarter of 2022 gets into full swing, investors have to navigate through several contradictory currents. Inflation remains stubbornly high, and with the Russo-Ukraine war and renewed Chinese lockdowns, it will get no help on the supply chain front. But March’s jobs numbers were encouraging, indicating that employment has almost returned to its pre-pandemic levels. And the Federal Reserve has begun its policy switch, from easy money to an anti-inflationary tightening stance. Writing from Oppenheimer, chief investment strategist John Stoltzfus asks the main question: “With the Fed in inflation-fighting mode, the question is not will they hike, but by how much?” So far, after the first bump of 25 basis points, indications are for 4 to 5 more hikes this year, each of 25 to 50 basis points. We should expect the Feds funds rate to reach approximately 2% to 2.5% by year’s end. But probably not much higher, according to Stoltzfus. “From our perch on the market radar screen it looks to us that the Fed’s efforts to curb inflation in the months and quarters ahead will likely be more akin to pumping the brakes to slow the US economy rather than pulling the emergency brake and risk sending the economy and the markets through the proverbial windshield. Jerome Powell in our view has in no way signaled that he’d care to risk a recession by tightening too hard or too fast,” Stoltzfus wrote. If that does turn out to be the case, then investors should expect conditions at least somewhat conducive to growth. Meanwhile, the Oppenheimer stock analysts are busy picking out stocks that meet an intriguing profile: they crashed, and crashed hard, when the markets fell in the early part of the year, but still show a latent potential for a rebound. We’ve used the TipRanks database to pull up the details on three of them which, according to the Oppenheimer views, could soar 100% or more in the coming months. Let’s dig into the details, and get the whole story. Lightning eMotors (ZEV) We’ll start in the electric vehicle (EV) sector, where Lightning eMotors has staked out positions in two separate niches. The company approaches EVs through both vehicle drive systems and the electric charging station network. In addition, Lightning eMotors doesn’t try to build whole vehicles; rather, it builds the electric motors and power trains needed to operate existing chassis designs as EVs, and even offers EV conversion packages for existing gasoline vehicles. The company markets its products and services to vehicle manufacturers and fleet operators, especially in the commercial and urban transport niches. 2021 was a difficult year for Lightning eMotors. The supply chain problems cut into the number of available chassis, by limited manufacturers’ ability to produce and deliver them, and Lightning has had difficulty securing enough supply to meet demand for its electric vehicles. The company has worked to meet the challenge by expanding its non-chassis dependent products – vehicle conversions and charging station infrastructure – but both avenues require time. For the present, the company reported 4Q21 revenues below expectations. The top line came in at $4.2 million for the quarter, up 13% year-over-year but well below the forecast of $5.3 million. The company attributed the miss to delays in chassis deliveries from 3rd party producers, and acknowledged that the delays are likely to continue into the latter half of this year. As a result, in its guidance, Lightning has pushed approximately $7 million in 1Q22 potential revenue into upcoming quarters. The upshot of all of this is that Lightning’s shares are down significantly, having lost 56% over the last 12 months. In one indication of the company’s strength, and ability to counter the downward pressure on share prices, Lightning announced last month a partnership with Forest River – the large manufacturer of RVs, commercial vehicles, and urban busses – for the conversion of shuttle busses and delivery vans from gasoline to electric. The partnership will cover over 50,000 FR vehicles across the US. This project builds on existing collaborations between Lightning and Forest River. It also complements Lightning’s existing production backlog, which is currently valued at $169.3 million. Taking a holistic view of Lightning eMotors, Oppenheimer’s 5-star analyst Colin Rusch sees plenty of potential, writing: “We expect ZEV to the benefit from of its internal chassis ramp specifically because its purpose built design optimizes battery location eliminating weight and assembly complexity. We believe this offering will aid volumes along with cost structure and vehicle performance. We are also encouraged by ZEV's expanded relationship with Forrest River to offer retrofit buses, which we believe can further aid growth along with its standalone powertrain offering."" ""While revenue ramp has been pushed out due to supply chain headwinds, we believe ZEV is one of the few companies successfully making medium duty vehicles, which we expect it to leverage into a sustainable share position,” the analyst summed up. Everything that ZEV has going for it convinced Rusch to leave his Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating as is. Along with the call, he keeps the price target at $15, suggesting ~231% upside potential. (To watch Rusch’s track record, click here) It turns out that other analysts also have high hopes. With 4 Buy ratings, the word on the Street is that this stock, which currently going for $4.36 apiece, is a Strong Buy. In addition, the $11 average price target puts the upside potential at ~152%. (See ZEV stock forecast on TipRanks) Asana (ASAN) The second stock we’ll look at is a software firm, offering a range of product management and team collaboration tools and apps. Asana’s products are available through mobile and web versions, and are used to manage, organize, and track both individual and collective work projects. The real ‘added value’ here is the system’s applicability to both office and home working environments, a clear advantage for today’s white-collar environment when so many workers are connecting from wide-spread locations. The quality of the company’s product – and the high demand – can both be discerned in the company’s recent revenues. Asana has released 7 quarterly reports since going public in 2019, and has put up 6 consecutive sequential revenue gains. The last report, for 4Q of fiscal year 2022, showed $111.9 million at the top line, for a year-over-year gain of 64%. Earnings came in at a net loss of 25 cents, in line with the last five quarters. Asana’s shares peaked this past November, and since then have fallen 74%. A large part of that drop has come recently – the stock dropped 27% of its value just in March of this year. It’s a company with a strong product in high demand, seeing plenty of revenue growth, so the fall in share value raised the question, What gives? The answer may lie in the forward guidance. Management pointed toward fiscal 1Q23 sales numbers between $114.5 million and $115.5 million, which would represent ~50% y/y growth, a clear slowdown from the published Q4 result. Also, the guided Q1 net loss, at approximately 35.5 cents per share, is significantly deeper than the 26.5 cent net loss that analysts had expected. In his comments on this stock, Oppenheimer’s Ittai Kidron, a ‘Top 25’ analyst per TipRanks, sees the company’s continued growth as the key factor in the long haul, even with the predicted slowdown. He writes: “Asana's strong quarter and steady sales execution reinforce our belief that it can successfully drive user growth and enterprise adoption over time. That said, we expect investors to take a cautious view of the aggressive near-term investment. While mindful of near-term volatility, we're comfortable buying with a long-term focus given the large TAM…” Based on all of the above, Kidron stays with the bulls, reiterating an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating and $85 price target. Investors could be pocketing a gain of 133%, should this target be met in the twelve months ahead. (To watch Kidron’s track record, click here) Asana has decent support amongst Kidron's colleagues. ASAN's Moderate Buy consensus rating is based on 8 Buys, 3 Holds and 1 Sell. The stock’s average price target of $57.83 and current trading price of $37.3 combine to give an upside of ~59% for the next 12 months. (See ASAN stock forecast on TipRanks) Immuneering (IMRX) We’ll wrap up this list with a preclinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. Immuneering is pursuing a novel approach in cancer treatment, developing new drugs with short half-lives to limit toxicity effects. The drug candidates under development are designed to disrupt the abnormal activation of the MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways that permit tumors to metastasize while evading the patient’s immune system. By creating less toxic therapeutic agents, Immuneering hopes to introduce a new class of anti-cancer drugs useful in broad patient populations. All of this costs money, and Immuneering moved to raise capital through an IPO last summer. At the end of July, the company put 8.625 million shares on the market at $15 each, raising some $129.4 million gross proceeds from the sale. Since then, IMRX shares saw volatile trading in the late-summer and autumn months, and since the start of this year have fallen 56%. In its first few months as a public company, Immuneering has moved closer to the clinical trial stage. Its leading drug candidate, IMM-1-104, has shown a broad range of activity against a variety of tumors in preclinical animal studies, and the company expects to file the Investigative New Drug application with the FDA in 3Q22. The second drug candidate, IMM-6-415 is now entering the IND-enabling studies. This second candidate is designed to cause resistant tumors to develop sensitivity to select immunotherapies. Analyst Mark Breidenbach, in his note for Oppenheimer, sees the start of human trials later this year as the key factor for this company. “Immuneering’s lead program, a novel MEK inhibitor, has been rationally designed to overcome a key resistance mechanism in cancer cells while minimizing collateral damage to healthy tissues. Preclinical data suggest ‘104 can hold its own against FDA-approved drugs targeting the same pathway, but with potential for cleaner safety and applicability to a much broader patient population. With ‘104 advancing into the clinic this year, we see potential for serious value inflection in the next 12-to-18 months,” Breidenbach opined. Taking the above into consideration, Breidenbach rates IMRX an Outperform (i.e. Buy), and his $25 price target implies a robust upside of 253% over the coming months. (To watch Breidenbach’s track record, click here) It’s not only Oppenheimer that takes an upbeat view of this biopharma researcher; all three of the recent analyst reviews here are positive, making the Strong Buy consensus rating unanimous. The stock’s $33.67 average price target suggests a one-year upside of a whopping 379%.

4/9/2022,"LONDON (Reuters) - The macro-economic picture is deteriorating fast and could push the U.S. economy into recession as the Federal Reserve tightens its monetary policy to tame surging inflation, BofA strategists warned in a weekly research note. ""'Inflation shock' worsening, 'rates shock' just beginning, 'recession shock' coming"", BofA chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a note to clients, adding that in this context, cash, volatility, commodities and crypto currencies could outperform bonds and stocks. The Federal Reserve on Wednesday signalled it will likely start culling assets from its $9 trillion balance sheet at its meeting in early May and will do so at nearly twice the pace it did in its previous ""quantitative tightening"" exercise as it confronts inflation running at a four-decade high. A large majority of investors also expect the central bank to hike its key interest rate by 50 basis point. In terms of notable weekly flows, BofA said emerging market equity funds enjoyed the biggest inflow in ten weeks at $5.3 billion in the week to Wednesday while emerging market debt vehicles attracted $2.2 billion, their best week since September. It was also an eight week of outflows for European equities at $1.6 billion while U.S. stocks enjoyed their second week of inflows, adding $1.5 billion in the week to Wednesday. The analysis was based on EPFR data.

4/9/2022,"Most Americans have at least heard of a 401(k) plan, but there is another tax-advantaged workplace retirement plan out there - the 403(b). A 403(b) operates similarly to a 401(k), but is generally only available to public sector employees and some non-profit workers - including teachers, university employees and religious leaders. While in many ways a 403(b) works exactly like a 401(k), there has, up till now, been a key difference in the way required minimum distributions work once a saver gets to the withdrawal portion of his retirement journey. A new rule from the IRS, though, could change all that and tighten a potential loophole for those who saved in a 403(b) during their careers. If you have a 403(b), 401(k) or any other tax-advantaged retirement plan, consider getting the help of a financial advisor to make sure you're in compliance with all rules and regulations. 403(b) Definition A 403(b) plan is a tax-deferred workplace retirement plan, just like a 401(k) plan. It works very similarly to a 401(k). You put in money from your paycheck before taxes are taken out. It goes into your account and into a portfolio of investments you select. It is allowed to grow over the years, hopefully earning interest and capital gains. When you retire, you take distributions from your plan based on your monetary needs, and you pay taxes on the money then - when it is treated like regular income by the federal government. Some states fully tax retirement income, some tax it partially and others exempt it completely (and some states have no income tax at all, making it a moot point.) The biggest difference between the two plans comes down simply to who uses them. 401(k) plans tend to be for employees of private companies, while 403(b) plans are for public employees and non-profit workers. Required Minimum Distributions, Defined As noted above, money is put into a 403(b) before it is taxed. It is then allowed to grow tax-free until the saver starts withdrawing in retirement. To prevent the money from being kept tax-free for too long, the government requires money start being taken out when the plan participant turns 72. The exact required withdrawal can be determined using the chart on this page. Failure to take out the required minimum distribution each year can result in significant penalties, so it is important to be on top of what you have to take out each year. RMDs apply to most tax-advantaged accounts, including IRAs, 403(b) plans and 401(k) plans. They do not apply to Roth accounts, where taxes are paid before the money is invested. Proposed Rule Change Currently, the RMD rules apply to a person's 403(b) investments broadly. If a saver has multiple 403(b) contracts, he can take his entire RMD each year out of one contract, potentially allowing him to keep money in the most lucrative of his contracts. The new rule would require RMDs to be taken out of each contract a person has. This is how RMDs work for 401(k) plans, so this new rule would essentially be making 403(b) plans operate like other tax-advantaged plans. The rule is not finalized yet, and PlanSponsor notes that there is a lot of discussion in the industry about the impact it would have on the retirement world more broadly. The comment period on the rule goes until May 25. The Bottom Line A proposed new IRS rule would change the way RMDs work for 403(b) plans, requiring savers to take an RMD on each contract they have in their account rather than only taking from one. This rule isn't set in stone yet, but it could have big impacts on both savers and the retirement industry.

4/9/2022,"Warren Buffett’s long-term outlook on investments proved successful once again when Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) shares reached $500,000 last month, and have stayed above that level since. If there’s one thing that’s made Buffett one of the most successful investors in history, it’s his commitment to his strategy. A countless number of new investment techniques and algorithms have come and gone over the years, but Buffett has maintained his fairly simple strategy of picking solid companies and focusing on long-term growth while somehow ignoring the noise that sends most investors into a panic. It may seem odd that somebody with such a disciplined long-term approach to investing has no interest in purchasing real estate, especially since it's what vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Charles Munger used to build his fortune. There’s a Difference Between Buying Real Estate and Investing in Real Estate Buffett isn’t opposed to investing in real estate and has invested in several real estate investment trusts (REITs) over the years. However, he knows it makes little sense to get into the business of being a landlord. Buying and managing real estate is more of a business than it is an investment, and Buffett knows that his time is better spent choosing companies to invest in than it is running a real estate business. Real estate is a tough business and one that often needs to be scaled to comprise several properties in order to build significant wealth. Many individual investors get into real estate with the misconception that it’s a passive investment, and most eventually exit those properties once realizing what they’ve actually gotten into. Investing in real estate is a different story. Passive real estate investments allow investors to reap the rewards of this profitable asset class without taking on the management responsibilities. The FTSE Nareit All Equity REITs index has outperformed the S&P 500 in total returns during 13 out of the last 20 years, producing an average total annual return of 13.1% versus 11.1% for the S&P 500. Many investors that have turned to the private markets for passive real estate investments have averaged even greater returns. For instance, the real estate crowdfunding platform CrowdStreet has produced an average internal rate of return (IRR) of 18.5% for investors on its fully realized deals since 2014. Related: Real Estate Crowdfunding Returns Compared Passive investors even have the option to buy shares of individual rental properties now with as little as $100. The Jeff Bezos-backed real estate investment platform has fully funded 88 rental properties with a total value of over $35 million since its launch just over a year ago. Buying and managing real estate is a business with incredible profit potential, but it’s important to realize that it’s a business and not a passive investment. The returns realized through owning real estate are a direct result of the time, energy and money that goes into it. While that business has been the source of many great fortunes over the years, it’s just simply not a business that makes sense for most people.

4/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo had more banks than letters in his name before Avenue Capital Group founder Marc Lasry stepped in.

That shocked Lasry, who co-owns the Milwaukee team. “I spend a lot of time with them explaining where they should invest,” he said of his players on Thursday at the Bloomberg Wealth Summit in New York. “I’m like, Giannis, you can’t be having accounts at 50 different banks. Let me tell you something, if JPMorgan goes under, your little dinky banks are going to go under too. Let me explain what you should buy, you should buy U.S. Treasuries, you should buy this.” Antetokounmpo, 27, is nicknamed the “Greek Freak” because he was born in Greece and shows freakish athletic ability on the court. The country faced a sovereign-debt crisis in the early 2010s, which strained its banking system and left citizens worried their cash wasn’t safe. In a wide-ranging discussion with David Rubenstein, co-founder and co-chairman of Carlyle Group, Lasry said when he discovered his $550 million bid for the Bucks was $100 million more than the next-highest offer, he tried unsuccessfully to bring his lower. He isn’t buying any more basketball franchises because they’re too expensive -- but he did purchase a pickleball team for less than $1 million. His New York-based firm, which has about $12 billion in assets, has increasingly moved into the private lending business due to the lack of distressed debt in the market. He expects to see more companies run into trouble in the next two to three years than in the previous few. “When people come to me, they have issues,” he said. “They can’t borrow. Or they have assets but no cash flow.” Lasry, 62, said he’s also worried about the U.S. government’s ability to pay off its $30 trillion in debt without deflating the value of the dollar. “As rates move up, because of the debt we have, the cost of servicing that debt is so expensive, it’s going to be an issue,” he said. Lasry, who doesn’t normally wear socks but chose to on a rainy day in New York, doesn’t just dole out financial advice to Bucks players, but also meets them on the basketball court. He said he can win when they play “Horse,” but only if they play by “his rules.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek China’s $2.3 Trillion Infrastructure Plan Puts America’s to Shame The Bridgewater CEO Who Went Full MAGA This Is the Red-Hot Center of the Tightest Job Market Since WWII Apple Makes It Easy to Work Remotely (Unless You Work for Apple) Suddenly Short of Workers, U.S. Is Forced to Rethink Job Credentials ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•19 hours ago,Giannis Antetokounmpo Put His Money in 50 Banks Until Bucks Owner Helped Him Invest,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/giannis-antetokounmpo-put-money-50-194219920.html
4/9/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Don’t be fooled by the stock market’s rapid-fire reaction to the news. It’s just the beginning of the first real slog in years, one that will hand a comeuppance to passive investors who once thought the only way for prices to go was up. Most Read from Bloomberg Canada to Ban Foreigners From Buying Homes as Prices Soar Mocked as ‘Rubble’ by Biden, Russia’s Ruble Roars Back Putin Army Regroups for Ukraine Showdown After Invasion Setback Russia Sidesteps Sanctions to Supply Energy to Willing World If Stocks Don’t Fall, the Fed Needs to Force Them That’s the view of James Abate, whose Centre American Select Equity Fund (DHAMX) has beaten 97% of its peers during the past three years according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He says shares are getting less valuable due to rising interest rates and geopolitical angst. One possible outcome, as he sees it: a stock market that goes sideways for a year or more, swinging between spells of gains and losses. “I’m of the belief that we’re in the midst of a ‘time correction,’ where the market is still having to digest a transition away from a disinflationary, low-interest rate, low-risk premium type of environment,” Abate, 56, said in an interview. “If you are a momentum trader or a passive investor, it’s going to be a period of maximum frustration.” After peaking out on the first day of trading, the S&P 500 has fallen as much as 13%, marking one of the longest stretches of the past decade in which the market has dropped without bouncing back to a new record high. The last time the index spent more than a year without making a fresh peak was during the 2015-2016 oil crisis. Abate’s $300 million fund has returned 13% this year, in part thanks to a hedging position the firm added at the end of last year through put options on the Nasdaq 100. After taking profits on the trade in January, the fund has shied away from rolling out new hedges. The performance stands out in a year when many actively managed funds have struggled to navigate the latest bout of market turbulence. Read more: Active Funds Get Crushed After Falling in Love With Their Hedges The way Abate sees it, placing a proper price-earnings multiple on the broad market is getting tricky. With 10-year Treasury yields spiking, the S&P 500’s earnings yield -- a reciprocal of its P/E ratio -- has seen its premium shrink to the smallest in almost a year. Yet when adjusted for inflation expectations, stocks still look relatively cheap. The S&P 500 edged up slightly Thursday. Still, that doesn’t mean stocks are bound to go higher. Amid all the macroeconomic headwinds, investors are likely reluctant to pay up for stocks the way they used to. And at 20 times forecast earnings, the S&P 500 is still trading at a multiple that before the 2020 pandemic was higher than any time since the dot-com era. An adjustment “doesn’t necessarily mean that the indices are susceptible to a very sharp corrective phase, because I think a lot of the froth has come out of the market already,” said Abate. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the indices are at the same level that they are today, a year from now, but within a channel where we’re 10% higher or 10% lower as we kind of go sideways for a period of time.” Given the backdrop, the fund manager is now focused on picking the right stocks. Recently, he trimmed holdings in travel-related stocks and transportation companies, citing their inability to sustain the post-pandemic momentum in growth. Meanwhile, he added shares with high dividends as a buffer if the fund’s economically sensitive holdings such as energy producers falter. Broadly, with inflation running at a four-decade high, Abate favors companies that are able to pass on higher prices to customers. “People who are thinking that we’re going to go right back to this disinflationary environment, I think, are mistaken,” he said. “We really are in a major inflection point to the way the world has been for the prior five years, and people are still reluctant to embrace it. It’s why I think there’s plenty of opportunities.” (A previous version was corrected to fix the spelling of manager’s name.)

4/9/2022,"For older workers who retired and are considering a return to the workplace, the tight labor market is promising. “There's a wide gamut of opportunities that people pursue after retirement,” Kimberly Schneiderman, a career coach and Randstad RiseSmart senior practice development manager, recently told Yahoo Finance Live (video above). A key to landing a new position is to not get stuck in the past. Hiring managers aren’t interested in “a career obituary,” she said. With close to two open jobs for each of the 6 million unemployed workers that the Labor Department counted in February, older workers are in a more powerful position today than they’ve been in years to score a new job. Retirees looking for a new start need to be careful not to “just recite everything that we've done for the last 10, 20, or 30 years,” she said. “We really need to think about what we're going after next and how our experience aligns with the needs in that area.” Workers transitioning to a new field will have the advantage of re-deploying their skills and experience. “You might be able to use the transferable skills from the career that you've had into your new role,” she said. In February, 3% of retired workers made the decision to return to work, marking the highest percentage to date during the pandemic and a continuance of a movement that started in the spring of 2021, Nick Bunker, the director of economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, recently told Yahoo Money: “Even more retirees could come off the sidelines.” What’s spurring these older job seekers? “A lot of people decide to return to the workforce after retiring because they might be feeling unfulfilled in not working,” Schneiderman said. “Maybe they're annoying their spouse or a partner at home. Maybe they're finding that their hobbies just aren't as fun as they thought they were, or their family isn't as available as they thought they might be. Also, for some, it's all about finances.” There are some key questions retirees eager to return to the workforce should ask themselves, according to Schneiderman. First, they need to “reconsider what fulfillment is going to look like at this point in their lives,” she said. “They've probably enjoyed some aspects of that retirement time. They need to figure out what they don't want to lose completely as part of going back to work. Then, they need to consider, what does going back to work look like for them?” she said. “Is it within the field that they came out of? Is it something new? Are they going to choose to go into consulting? Or are they going to choose an encore career, such as teaching or other nonprofit or philanthropic type career paths?” The bottom line: “The important thing is that when people are going into a career path, no matter what it is and what the circumstances are, it's something that they're going to enjoy and can really see themselves doing and dedicating their time to each day.” Don’t set an expiration date for a comeback career Returning to work also requires a new mindset. This is not the same as embarking on a several decade climb up the career ladder in someone’s primary career. How long a one-time retiree stays in these encore career paths might be more predicated on when they left, or other factors such as health, according to Schneiderman. This stage has a different playbook. You might do something for a few years, and then move onto something else, or do a few different things at the same time.
