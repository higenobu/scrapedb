4/20/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- Sanctioned or unsanctioned, Russian billionaires face fresh hurdles after President Vladimir Putin dropped the curtain on the era of foreign stock listings.

That could force tycoons including Russia’s richest man, Vladimir Potanin, as well as steel billionaires Vladimir Lisin and Alexey Mordashov, to reconfigure the ownership structure of businesses they hold -- in part -- via overseas shares paying foreign-currency dividends. “Most companies and their main shareholders who had a listing or depositary receipts abroad won big from the financial freedoms and economic ties with the West,” said Anton Zatolokin, head of research at Otkritie Broker. “By destroying what took 30 years to build, they take a direct and indirect hit.” Few things in the late 1990s and 2000s showcased Russia’s rising economic clout and global financial integration better than the country’s biggest companies, like MMC Norilsk Nickel PJSC and Lukoil PJSC, registering depository receipt programs in New York, London and Frankfurt. From a peak of $17 billion in 2007 alone, Russian initial public offerings abroad have faltered in recent years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Such listings have raised only $6 billion in total since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, when international sanctions showed how vulnerable businesses were on foreign markets as geopolitics took a turn for the worse. Some tycoons seized on the slump in their companies’ share price to increase their positions. Lukoil Chairman Vagit Alekperov has regularly purchased depositary receipts from the market over the years, Bloomberg calculations show.

International sanctions have targeted tycoons, banks and even the country’s foreign reserves, while turning the nation’s listed companies into penny stocks in a matter of days. According to the amendments signed by Putin, trading in depositary receipts on foreign exchanges must stop 10 days after the bill is published. At the same time, the laws allows for special carve-outs if companies request permission to continue trading. Lisin’s NLMK PJSC said on Tuesday that it planned to file for a government permit to keep its GDRs listed in London, while oil company Tatneft PJSC said it was weighing its options, “including whether to apply for such permission,” according to a filing. Under the amended law, foreign holders of the cancelled depository receipts would receive ordinary shares that are placed on non-resident accounts in Russia. Since the invasion, capital controls ban foreigners from selling Russian securities, making it impossible for now to sell the ordinary stock and repatriate the proceeds. Even before the bill comes into force, JPMorgan & Chase had begun to allow holders of depositary receipts in Russian companies to cancel them, Reuters reported, citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter. Citigroup Inc. has opened books to cancel GDRs for En+ Group, which counts billionaire Oleg Deripaska as its largest shareholder, according to a company filing. “The rights of shareholders who believe in Russia and have invested in the Russian market for many years and who cannot hold Russian shares directly, are being hurt,” Lisin said in interview with Kommersant this month, commenting on the law. “They have nothing to do with politics, and there is a risk that their property rights will simply be lost.” (Adds NLMK, Tatneft in 10th paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Beijing Crackdown Derails Alibaba’s Bid for Amazon-Size Profit Alzheimer’s Trials Exclude Black Patients at ‘Astonishing’ Rate America’s Favorite Truck Is About to Test Tesla’s Dominance How Two Ex-Cops Cracked a $100 Million Maritime Mystery How Jack Dorsey Quit Twitter to Become Bitcoin’s Spiritual Leader ©2022 Bloomberg L.P.",Business/Bloomberg•7 hours ago,Putin Calls Time on Foreign Listings in Fresh Hit to Tycoons,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/putin-calls-time-foreign-listings-072239903.html
4/20/2022,"Reuters reported that demand for Paxlovid lagged estimates.  Pfizer’s coronavirus drug was expected to boost the company’s financial performance.  Earnings estimates have started to move lower, which is bearish for Pfizer shares.  Shares of Pfizer gained downside momentum after a Reuters report indicated that demand for the company’s antiviral drug Paxlovid was lower than previously expected. The report noted that factors like reduced testing and the spread of Omicron, which is believed to be less severe than Delta, contributed to the decline in demand for Paxlovid. Previously, markets thought that Paxlovid would be a material contributor to Pfizer’s bottom line. However, it looks that analysts will have to adjust their forecasts after the new report. Not surprisingly, Pfizer shares found themselves under pressure after the Reuters report was released. Analysts expect that Pfizer will report earnings of $7.23 per share in the current year and earnings of $5.69 per share in the next year, so the stock is trading at 9 forward P/E. It should be noted that analyst estimates have started to move lower in recent weeks as analysts began to adjust their demand forcasts for coronavirus vaccines and treatments. While Pfizer stock looks cheap at current valuation levels, it remains to be seen whether speculative traders will rush to buy the stock in the current situation. Earnings are expected to decline, and earnings estimates may move even lower in case sales of Paxlovid are weak as the Reuters report suggests. If analyst estimates continue to move lower in the upcoming weeks, Pfizer stock could find itself under more pressure and move closer to yearly lows near the $45.50 level.
