3/12/2022,"(Bloomberg) -- David Woo, the Wall Street contrarian who foresaw Donald Trump’s election in 2016 and how to profit from it, sees a much more dangerous world today with fewer investment options.

A cold war scenario in which the U.S. lost its global edge in technological innovation would also have implications for the dollar’s dominance in the global financial system, according to Woo, whose career has also included stints at Barclays Capital and the International Monetary Fund.

He reasons that there is little threat of inflation in China and the central bank is likely to ease monetary policy to bolster growth if needed. By contrast, the Federal Reserve is preparing to lift interest rates off zero when it meets next week as it embarks on a tightening cycle to curb inflation. Many fear it could tip economies into stagflation -- or even another recession -- just two years since the pandemic forced the deepest slump in decades. “I’m so worried because Covid was the first negative supply shock, now we’re getting the second negative supply shock,” Woo said. “The world has never had to deal with one negative supply shock in the last 20 years, let alone two, one after another.” (Adds detail on inflation call in final two paragraphs) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jeff Bezos Is Heading to Space and Partying on Earth While Amazon Faces a Host of Challenges Peloton Got Trapped in Its Trillion-Dollar Fantasy Putin Clings to Russia’s Market Economy as Sanctions Wind Back the Clock Putin’s Endgame Starts to Look Like Reducing Ukraine to Rubble ADHD Drugs Are Convenient To Get Online.

3/12/2022,"If you are an average investor, a cheaper stock price for Amazon (AMZN) could be just the moment you need to get into a growth company with major potential catalysts, analysts say. This week Amazon revealed a 20-for-1 stock split announcement. The company also uncorked a massive $10 billion stock buyback plan. Amazon's stock split is the fourth one in its history. The last split came in September 1999. If shareholders approve of the split, it will begin trading on the new basis on June 6. ""The stock split is important. It increases the accessibility to a broader array of investors and it does allow for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Academically, does it change the stock price? No, but it makes it more accessible and if you are included in the Dow index-based funds will have to own you. That creates demand for shares,"" said Wells Fargo tech analyst Brian Fitzgerald on Yahoo Finance Live. Shares of the e-commerce giant gained 5% on Thursday as traders cheered Amazon's stock split and new buyback. The stock tacked on another 1% in Friday's session. The stock has been among the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance platform the past 24-hours. Fitzgerald adds investors shouldn't overlook Amazon's buyback announcement either as it sends important clues on future profits. ""We think that the buyback is just further evidence of a sharper focus on profitability. Amazon undertook a significant investment cycle over the last two years to support the rapid expansion that happened during COVID. We believe that the investment intensity is downshifting to a more single digit basis,"" Fitzgerald said. Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.
