1/8/2022,"As director of the Massachusetts Highway Safety Division, Jeff Larason first noticed the two streaks of light from the window of his third-storey office. He would have been preparing for the day, nursing a morning coffee. He would watch as a cross formed on Stuart Street, Boston, at around 8am. It would hold for only a few minutes in the earliest spring weeks. The shape intrigued him, and he recognised its potential; alongside his main job, he had been photographing the streets of Boston for 40 years. Still, it took two years to get this shot.  Larason used his phone, which had a better zoom lens than his usual camera. “It was a lot of waiting, and watching people cross the street,” he recalls. “I didn’t mind. I’ve always been drawn to the way people hold themselves, and the story that tells. Do they have a bounce in their step? How are they holding their shoulders, tipping their head? How have the years of their life weighed on them?” The photo is entirely organic, the three men unaware of the serendipitous moment they’d created together. Recently, a building has gone up in the adjacent street. This dance of light has gone for ever. “But that’s the case with all street photography, and all light,” Larason says. “It’s transient. It’s there, and then it’s gone.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,"‘It was a lot of waiting, and watching people cross’: Jeff Larason’s best phone picture",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/08/it-was-a-lot-of-waiting-and-watching-people-cross-jeff-larasons-best-phone-picture
1/8/2022,"Many teachers across the US are resisting immediate school reopenings and asking for improved safety measures this month as a record number of Covid-19 cases have been recorded as a result of the spread of the Omicron variant. A few school districts have opted to restart school after the winter break remotely for the first week or two, while most others are grappling with tightening or reinstituting Covid-19 safety protocols.  Several teachers who spoke to the Guardian expressed concerns over severe staffing shortages, a lack of adequate and promised personal protective equipment, difficulties in accessing Covid testing and worsening overall working conditions. Rori Abernethy, a teacher in San Francisco, California, said teachers are being faced with severe staffing shortages that are forcing teachers to serve as substitutes during preparation time and are increasing their classroom sizes due to teachers and other staff retiring, resigning, or calling out sick. “This is the hardest teaching year I’ve had in 20 years,” said Abernethy. “Morale is low amongst teachers and it feels like the whole city is fighting over politics and no one cares about what teachers are going through in the classroom. If we do complain, people are cruel and tell us to quit or that we don’t care about kids.” She also noted staff and students haven’t received enough personal protective equipment such as proper masks, that Covid testing is difficult for teachers given stringent drop-off times and is not mandated or easily available for students, and that Covid sick leave for teachers expired at the end of 2021. According to Abernethy, four teachers at her school quit before winter break, and 25 staff were absent on the first day of school after the break, on 3 January, though student attendance was normal. There were 575,000 fewer local and state education employees in October 2021 than in February 2020. Before the pandemic, teacher shortages were widespread and growing throughout the US, while many public school buildings were crumbling, in dire need of repairs, proper upkeep or replacement. Retha Roblero, an elementary school teacher in Columbus, Ohio, participated in a safety strike on 3 January with other teachers who were working in their school building while students were remote, as part of the building had no working heat. Less than an hour after the strike began, teachers were permitted by the district to work remotely. “There’s no good answer,” said Roblero, about the choice between in-person or remote learning in response to Covid surges. “I want to be in person teaching every day. But I also don’t want to carry something or somebody else to carry something.” Alison Ross, a teacher for about 20 years based in the Atlanta, Georgia, area, resigned from her school district position in fall 2020 over a disregard for Covid protections as she is immunocompromised. She has been tutoring and teaching remotely part-time, while relying on savings, and is dismayed at the prospect of returning to a full-time position as the pandemic continues to spread in the US. “I feel like my livelihood was stolen from me,” said Ross. “We could afford N95 masks for everybody, we could afford good ventilation, we can afford paying teachers more and having smaller classes. These are all choices that as a society, our government has made. People just think that’s just how it has to be and that’s not how it has to be.” A teacher in Crested Butte, Colorado, who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation described a lack of testing options for staff and students, with long wait lines at testing sites and no at-home tests available. The teacher says staff have been reporting to work after testing positive and there’s a lack of transparency in contact tracing compared with previous periods during the pandemic. “We have been told that they simply do not have the staff or time to deal with it, so contact tracing is out the window,” the teacher said. “The morale is quite low because staff feel uncared for. I know several teachers with the mindset that we will all get it eventually so let’s just get it over with. As teachers, we’re the ones that take on the brunt of it to protect the kids.” Staffing shortages in their school district have also extended to a lack of school bus drivers, substitute teachers, cafeteria workers and a decline in student attendance. They already used up their Covid sick leave earlier this school year when they tested positive after their son caught it, despite being fully vaccinated. “To the general public and administration, it just feels that staff and student health doesn’t matter. We should have tested to return. No one wants to wear masks or go to school virtually, however now we may be forced to do so without a plan in place,” the teacher added. “I have been searching for jobs that are safer and value my family’s health and safety more. We feel so undervalued.” In New York City, teachers held a protest during the first school week in January over school reopenings and a lack of Covid safety measures for students and staff. “We’re concerned about not having a negative Covid result as a requirement for returning like other school districts and private schools had,” said Ronnie Almonte, a teacher at Bard High School Early College in Manhattan, who noted Bard College requires a negative test to return to the campus this spring. He also expressed concerns with the new Covid isolation guidelines, which decreased isolation days from 10 to five days. Teachers in Chicago voted to return to remote learning over lack of Covid safety measures, though Chicago public schools cancelled school and locked out teachers from electronic accounts in retaliation. Sarah Caswell, a science teacher in Philadelphia, argued the push to continue in-person school during a pandemic hasn’t accounted for the problems facing public education systems before the pandemic began, from overcrowding to excessive standardized testing and socio-economic disparities, with Covid further exposing those problems. “Morale is the absolute lowest that I’ve ever seen it,” said Caswell. “This goes from the top all the way down through the building administration. They expect that we’re going to treat families and students with grace and understand that everybody’s living through these crazy times and be supportive and encouraging, which is absolutely what we have to do and should be doing right now. But they don’t show the same grace with us.” In Philadelphia, 81 schools switched to remote learning with less than 24 hours notice, and Caswell noted that numerous staff at her school tested positive during the first day of school. “It’s this constant anxiety and stress,” added Caswell. “It’s just a lot of pressure from a lot of different directions and not a whole lot of compassion and grace. My belief is the academics will work their way out. Kids are resilient when you provide them with the right support, and instead we’re saying that we’re going to go back to what we’ve always done. That didn’t work before the pandemic, so why does it work now?”",News/Education,‘Morale is low’: US teachers push back on school reopenings amid Omicron wave,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/08/us-teachers-schools-omicron-staff-shortages-working-conditions-testing
1/8/2022,"Almaty, the commercial capital of Kazakhstan, is the kind of mirage that oil-rich nations so often produce. It has all the trappings of comfort and consumer excess: swanky shopping malls, luxury car dealerships, high-end hotels. This is the image of prosperity that the country’s rulers enjoy projecting to the world. For decades, Kazakhs have been encouraged to take out expensive loans to experience their share in the dream: to buy flats, cars and even holidays they can barely afford.  Beyond the limits of Almaty and the capital city, Nur-Sultan, however, the illusion begins to look threadbare. And the causes behind the protests currently gripping the central Asian nation come into focus. Average monthly salaries are less than £450 ($600). Police, doctors, teachers and all kinds of government workers supplement their meagre pay with bribes. In the distant west of this vast country, which is 11 times the size of the UK with about a quarter of its population, there is the arid Mangystau province, where most of Kazakhstan’s oil reserves lie. It’s where the unrest now gripping the country has its roots. The government is all about bringing in free-market rules and finally burying the vestiges of the command economy that prevailed when Kazakhstan was a Soviet republic. It was in that spirit that it gradually phased out subsidies for liquid petroleum gas, the fuel that many people in western Kazakhstan use to power their cars. On New Year’s Day, motorists awoke to find it would cost twice as much as the day before to fill their tanks. Demonstrations ensued. This sort of high-handedness smarts particularly acutely in the west of the country. Why, they wonder, when their regions contribute so much to the country’s wealth, is there so little investment in basic infrastructure? Why do foreign oil workers earn so much more than Kazakhs? Why doesn’t the government listen to the complaints of the people until they come out in numbers on the streets? This last question is key to understanding what is happening today. Kazakhstan’s government, like so many of its authoritarian counterparts, has chosen to wreck its feedback mechanism. It has parlayed considerable funds into a system known as the “state order”, funding media outlets – even those not belonging to the state – to convey news about the government’s policies with a cheery gloss. The few outlets trying to strike out and produce critical coverage face harassment and legal action. Some issues are absolutely off-limits. In October, one news outlet, Hola.kz, took the liberty of reporting stories made possible by the Pandora Papers leak relating to the former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev (he stepped aside in 2019, but was until this week believed to still wield considerable sway over the running of the country). The website was immediately blocked. The state claimed that it had not banned the website; it was back online 10 days later. Legislation adopted in 2010 made any coverage of Nazarbayev and his family deemed insulting, defamatory or overly invasive an offence worthy of imprisonment. This tight control creates frustration and masks evidence of deep social ills. Teen suicide is a huge problem, for instance. In 2008, Kazakhstan became one of the world’s worst places for suicide among 15- to 19-year-olds. Numbers came down in the decade that followed but sprang back up as the Covid-19 pandemic hit. It took a deadly fire in the city of Nur-Sultan, which killed five children from the same family in February 2019, for the government to refrain from sending in the police to bust up rallies of people demanding more help for low-income households. Even the Kazakh police did not have had the stomach to quell those protests as they normally do with even the smallest gatherings. One symptom of this malaise is that when protest seasons begin, they quickly broaden in scope. The residents of the western oil town of Zhanaozen came out on 2 January to demand lower fuel prices. Two days later, by the time people in Almaty, around 1,200 miles away, had hit the streets, the slogans had changed. Chants of “shal ket!” – Kazakh for “old man go!”, a reference to Nazarbayev – have become a mainstay in anti-government meetings. In a grim echo of uprisings in many other authoritarian nations, the exuberance quickly turned sour. Riot police swooped in with teargas and stun grenades to disperse the columns of peaceful demonstrators that marched to Almaty’s Republic Square. The message was clear: mass shows of dissent are not acceptable. And so a more violent contingent has now stepped into the breach. It is difficult to know what exactly is going on in the country since the government has turned off the internet, and telephones don’t work. Eyewitnesses in Almaty who have managed to get the word out have talked of sustained exchanges of gunfire right in the centre of the city. Authorities claim some gunmen tried to seize a television tower. Dozens of people, including at least 18 law enforcement officers, have been killed. The authorities on Friday described what was unfolding in Almaty as a sophisticated, well-prepared assault against Kazakhstan by an armed terrorist gang numbering in the thousands. “We’re dealing here with armed and trained bandits, both local and foreign,” the president, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, declared on TV. “We must destroy them. This will be done soon.” It is a mystery so far who these people are supposed to be. Tokayev has ominously now turned to raging against the media and civil society. It was the “so-called free media” and outside actors who had abetted and instigated the unrest, he claimed. The remarks portend more crackdowns and denials about the reality of hardship in Kazakhstan. The old illusion of free-market abundance and popular contentment has been spoiled, so the government will now have to work twice as hard to make the next one more convincing.

1/8/2022,"The Mississippi officials met in the heat of summer with a singular goal in mind: stopping Black people from voting.  “We came here to exclude the Negro,” said the convention’s president. “Nothing short of this will answer.” This conclave took place in 1890. But remarkably, approximately 130 years later, the laws they came up with are still blocking nearly 16% of Mississippi’s Black voting-age population from casting a ballot. The US stands alone as one of the few advanced countries that allow people convicted of felonies to be blocked from voting after they leave prison. The policy in Mississippi underscores how these laws, rooted in the explicit racism of the Jim Crow south, continue to have discriminatory consequences today. One of those affected is Roy Harness, a 67-year-old social worker, who may never be able to vote because of a crime committed decades ago. In the mid-1980s, he was convicted of forgery after he ran up a debt to a drug dealer and cashed a series of fake checks. He spent nearly two years in prison and hasn’t been back since. In recent years, Harness, who is also an army veteran, has been on a new path. He enrolled in college when he was 55 and got his bachelor’s degree when he was 63. He got a master’s degree in 2019. Now a full-time social worker, Harness keeps a shelf behind his desk filled with awards and accomplishments – a reminder to his clients of all they can accomplish. In 2013, he tried to register during a voter registration drive at his college, but saw on a pamphlet that forgery, the crime he had been convicted of decades earlier, was a disenfranchising crime in Mississippi. “It makes me feel bad. I’ve served my country, nation … got a degree and [I] still can’t vote, no matter what you do to prove yourself,” he said. Mississippi also makes it nearly impossible for anyone convicted of a felony to get their voting rights back. Fewer than 200 people have succeeded in restoring their voting rights in the last quarter century, the Guardian can reveal, based on newly obtained data. Now, Harness is involved in a new effort to change Mississippi’s law. After slavery ended in Mississippi, following the US civil war, newly enfranchised Black voters in the state were beginning to wield political power. In 1870, Mississippi sent Hiram Revels to the US senate, the first Black person to serve in the body. By 1890, the delegates who gathered for a constitutional convention in Jackson, the state capitol, were determined to blunt this trend. They faced a significant roadblock to their racist goal. The new 15th amendment to the US constitution explicitly prohibited states from preventing people from voting based on their race. And so the delegates came up with a plan that would effectively prevent Black people from voting without explicitly saying that was their intent. The delegates enacted a poll tax and literacy tests, measures that would become widespread across the south, as a way of keeping people from voting. But they also enacted a provision that disqualified people convicted of specific felonies from voting. The crimes they picked were those they believed, based on prejudices, Black people were more likely to commit. Bribery, burglary, theft, arson, bigamy and embezzlement were among the crimes that would cause someone to lose their voting rights. Robbery and murder were not.Mississippi continues to see the legacy of its efforts to shut Black voters out of the political process today. It has one of the highest concentrations of Black people in the country, yet has not elected a Black person to statewide office in well over a century. It was among the states with the lowest voter turnout in the US in 2020. Even though Black Mississippians comprise about one-third of eligible voters in the state, they account for more than half of the 235,152 people who can’t vote in the state because of a felony conviction, according to an estimate by the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice non-profit. Overall, more than one in 10 citizens of voting age can’t cast a ballot in Mississippi because of a felony conviction – the highest rate of disfranchisement in the US. And it is astonishingly difficult for those affected to get their right to vote restored. To vote again, people with disqualifying felonies in Mississippi must first convince a lawmaker to introduce a bill in the legislature on their behalf to restore their voting rights. In other words, they need their own, individualized piece of law. The bill must then pass both chambers of the legislature by two-thirds vote and be approved by the governor. Mississippi is the only state in the country where people convicted of felonies need to go through the legislature to get their voting rights back, said Christopher Uggen, a professor at the University of Minnesota who studies felon disfranchisement. The only other path to get one’s voting rights back is a gubernatorial pardon, which hasn’t been granted in Mississippi in nearly a decade. The process is the same one the delegates spelled out during the 1890 racist constitutional convention, where the felony disqualification rule was created. It was included as a safeguard to ensure that well-connected white Mississippians who committed one of the disenfranchising crimes had a way of gaining their voting rights back. Mississippi does not keep track of how many people successfully get their voting rights restored each year. But data compiled by Blake Feldman, a criminal justice researcher in Mississippi, shows it’s almost no one. Feldman began tallying the data in 2018 for the Southern Poverty Law Center, and has continued to track it since. Since 1997, an average of about seven people have been successful each year. In the 2021 legislative session, just two people made it through the process. There are no posted instructions anywhere online, said Hannah Williams, a research and policy analyst at MS Votes, a non-profit that works to expand voter access. Applicants must submit a paper form – there is no online option – to their lawmaker and convince them to vouch for them. After that, their fate is in the hands of lawmakers, who can reject an application for any reason. “There really isn’t a way to guarantee anything because the process doesn’t really make sense. There’s no information. You can’t go to a website. And to be honest, you can’t even call the capitol to get information, because they don’t really know what the process is,” she said. “Unless you know somebody that knows somebody that knows somebody who has their ear to the floor, you don’t know when you have to turn these applications in,” she added. Nick Bain, a Republican who chairs the Mississippi House judiciary committee, which oversees the bills for rights restoration, acknowledged the process was “convoluted”. Both chambers can set whatever criteria they want people to meet before they restore someone’s voting rights. Those criteria, which are not posted publicly, do not have to agree. “I do believe it’s patently unfair the way that we do the process. And maybe as a Republican, that may not be the Republican thinking on that,” he said. “We have a problem with consistency. The process, it’s by no means perfect. By no means is it efficient … But right now it’s the only process that we have.” While the law today continues to disproportionately affect African Americans, white Mississippians are affected too. Dennis Hopkins, a 46-year-old maintenance supervisor from Potts Camp, Mississippi, was convicted of grand larceny as a teenager in the 1990s, released from prison in 2001, and hasn’t been able to vote since. Because he was convicted of a felony when he was a teenager, he’s never been able to vote in his life. Even though he has raised nine children (he’s adopted several), become a local fire chief, and coached many school sports teams with hundreds of kids, he can’t vote. “I’m thinking ‘you sentenced me to four years in prison and you’re giving me a life sentence,’” he said. “I feel like I’m a branded man and I’m not equal to everybody else.” Harness and Hopkins are now the lead plaintiffs in two separate high-stakes federal lawsuits challenging Mississippi’s felon disfranchisement laws. One suit argues that the list of original disqualifying crimes unconstitutionally targeted Black people and therefore should be struck down. The second, filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center in 2018, also challenges the Mississippi policy and takes aim at the arcane restoration process. “The process is fundamentally arbitrary and inherently susceptible to discrimination,” lawyers wrote. “There is no oversight of any kind to ensure that legislators do not exercise their discretion to vote against a proposed suffrage bill on the basis of an individual’s race, religion, or political leanings.” Even though the core of Mississippi’s policy remains what was drafted during the 1890 convention, lawyers for the state have argued its discriminatory taint have been removed. There have been small tweaks to the law; voters chose to remove burglary disenfranchising crime in 1950 and added murder and rape in 1968. In February, the US court of appeals for the 5th circuit upheld Mississippi’s policy, writing that 20th-century tweaks to the law removed the discrimination written into it in 1890. But the court later agreed to re-hear the case, and there were oral arguments in September. A decision is expected in the coming months. In late October, both Harness and Hopkins traveled to the state capitol and appeared before a panel of lawmakers. They were there for a hearing convened by Bain, who wanted to explore new ways to fix the process for getting voting rights back. At the end of the hearing, one of the lawmakers approached Hopkins and offered to file a rights restoration bill on his behalf. Hopkins was unaware the process was even a possibility – he had been told there was no way for him to get his voting rights back. Still, he refused. “That’s not gonna help everyone else. I told them ‘no’ – I’d prefer not to do that,” he said. “I tell my kids how important the vote is … it shames me to tell them I can’t vote and here is why,” he said. “I know there’s a lot of people who say, “my vote doesn’t count. Well I beg to differ. It does count.” ",News/US news,The racist 1890 law that’s still blocking thousands of Black Americans from voting,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/08/us-1890-law-black-americans-voting
1/8/2022,"Evelyn Forde, the headteacher of Copthall school in north-west London and vice-president of the Association of School and College Leaders, shares her diary from the first week back at school in 2022 as she grapples with staff absences due to Covid and reassures students anxious about lost learning. Tuesday (4 January)First day back after the Christmas break. It’s a staff inset day, with Covid testing for three year groups. That first day of term is always filled with a mixture of excitement and nervousness. I arrive at 6.30am as I want to make sure everything is ready to welcome staff back, and to check that our testing centre is ready. We’re good to go, but then at 7am my cover manager tells me we have 13 staff absent.  Within this figure there are some long-term absences but the significant majority is made up of staff who are having to isolate because they tested positive for Covid. Towards the end of last term we were averaging 10-13 staff absent a day, but I had really hoped the start of the new term would be better. I’m worried how I’m going to run the school and the impact it will have on staff and student morale. It feels like we are going all the way back to square one. WednesdayA normal school day, with testing for the remaining two year groups. Did I mention that yesterday we had five students test positive for Covid in the test centre and a stack of emails from families telling us their daughters had tested positive? I work with my senior team to put a plan together to cover for absent staff and to ensure that we have everything in place for those students isolating so they can remote into their lessons on Thursday. The sense of doom prevails as the number of absent staff rises from 13 to 14 and the list of supply teachers gets longer. I’m worried about how I’m going to pay for the spiralling supply costs and everything else we had budgeted for. But I look for the silver lining as I greet students at the start of the day and walk the school. It’s one of the nicest parts of the job. I come upon three year 13 students who want to speak to me about their January BTec exams. They are really anxious about staff being absent and worried what will happen if they are off with Covid when they are meant to sit their exams and how this might impact on their grades. I offer reassurances that it will all be OK, because that’s what we do as heads, but I’m worried too. I do some follow-up work on exam guidance and a final check to see if we can cover any additional absences tomorrow. ThursdayThe staffing challenge continues. I arrive at 7am, the same time as my deputy, who comments: “Are we able to cover even with so many out?” I consider it a win when I realise we are stable with 13 staff out and one who has confirmed that she will come back tomorrow as her isolation period ends and she feels well enough to return. Hurrah! We still have to juggle cover for those staff who are too ill to remote in. It is definitely a challenge, but with only one day to go it feels as if we have coped reasonably well. I am also feeling positive that a call from a retired teacher yesterday offering to come in and teach will mean my students will have a specialist in front of them next week to cover a long-term absence. But I am a realist and know things could change at any time. We check our remote learning policy and verify that all students remember their log-in details. We are increasing our communication to parents to remind them that their daughters need to take a lateral flow test twice a week as I am worried that we could end up with huge swathes of students out. Today we had 11 confirmed Covid cases and 23 waiting for their results to come back. FridayFeels like we are turning a corner today with only (I say only!) eight staff out today. We’ve still got seven supply teachers in, so my meeting this morning with my finance director is going to be interesting. Confirmed cases of Covid among the student body has risen slightly, with 13 positive results and 26 now awaiting results, so the challenge of providing remote teaching will remain for some time to come. As I reflect on a week which began with hope and optimism only to find myself worrying whether we would be able to manage with such high staff absences, I feel as if while we have ended the week in a much better position, I’m still anxious about the weeks ahead and what that holds for schools and colleges. I listened to the radio while driving in this morning to hear that the armed forces have sent 200 personnel into NHS hospitals across in London to plug staff shortages and while we don’t have an army of retired teachers to plug our staff shortages, what has become evidently clear is that we are a profession that is agile, flexible and committed to making sure that we do our best to maintain teaching standards despite the challenges we face. Let’s see what Monday brings …",News/Education,A headteacher’s diary: ‘First day back and we have 13 staff absent’,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/08/a-headteachers-diary-first-day-back-and-we-have-13-staff-absent
1/8/2022,"Democrats were already facing a bleak landscape for this year’s midterm elections, with Joe Biden’s approval rating languishing in the low 40s and his party holding narrow majorities in both the House and the Senate. Now, with Senator Joe Manchin’s refusal to support the Build Back Better Act, the chances of Republicans regaining control of the House of Representatives, and possibly the Senate as well, appear higher than ever.  If Democrats cannot pass Biden’s signature legislation, which includes massive investments in childcare, healthcare and climate initiatives, their failure may convince enough voters to support Republicans in November. However, if Democrats try to move forward with a version of the bill that Manchin supports, as some strategists have suggested, the final product may not be as attractive to voters. Democrats’ unappealing options will probably aid Republicans, who were already favored to take back the House after the midterms. Historically, the president’s party loses House seats in midterm elections, and Republicans need to flip only five districts to regain the majority. The decennial redistricting process has aided House Republicans’ cause, as the party controls the governorship and the state legislature in 23 states, compared with 14 states for Democrats. That advantage has allowed Republicans to draw more favorable congressional maps in a number of crucial swing states. Democrats have also accused Republicans of using voting restrictions, which were approved by at least 19 states last year, to limit their supporters’ access to the ballot box. In the evenly divided Senate, Republicans need to gain just one seat to take control of the chamber. Rick Scott, who leads Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, has already said he expects the party to have “a hell of a year”. Democrats’ possible failure to pass the Build Back Better Act may further assist Republican candidates, as it could strengthen their argument to voters that the $1.75tn spending package is the wrong solution for families struggling to recover financially from the coronavirus pandemic. Emma Vaughn, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee, attacked the Democratic bill as a “reckless spending spree,” telling the Guardian, “Americans reject their failed agenda and Republicans will continue to fight for American workers and businesses.” But despite Manchin’s surprise announcement last month that he would not support the Build Back Better Act, the White House and Democratic congressional leaders are still voicing optimism about getting the bill passed. “We have a very slim majority in the Senate. That means you need every single senator from across the spectrum of the Democratic party agreeing to what a package looks like moving forward,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week. “We’re not naive about how challenging that is and how challenging it can be, but we feel good about the possibility of getting something done. What the final package looks like, I can’t outline that for you at this point in time.” However, just hours earlier, Manchin had insisted that there are no conversations happening between him and the White House. “I’m really not going to talk about Build Back Better any more because I think I’ve been very clear on that. There [are] no negotiations going on at this time,” Manchin told reporters on Capitol Hill. Manchin’s opposition to the bill has intensified concerns among Democratic leaders that many vulnerable members may lose reelection this year, as voters blame the party for failing to follow through on their campaign promises despite having full control of the White House and Congress. “Voters have shown time and again that they want a robust economic environment creating good opportunities to build a better life for themselves and their family,” said congressman Brad Schneider, chair of the political arm of the centrist New Democrat Coalition, the New Dem Action Fund. “At the end of the day, we have to show working families we’re responsive to their kitchen table concerns.” Some Democratic strategists have argued the party’s best option now is to work with Manchin to craft a version of the Build Back Better Act that he can support and then move forward with that proposal. “Mr Manchin said at various points that he could support a scaled-back bill that made long-term commitments to fewer priorities,” David Axelrod, a former adviser to Barack Obama, said in a recent New York Times column. “If, through a retooled Build Back Better Act, Mr Biden can achieve significant and durable progress on some major priorities that will benefit children and families for generations, Democrats would be wise to celebrate and tout those gains instead of complaining about what wasn’t possible.” Schneider echoed that argument, telling the Guardian, “Since the start of negotiations, New Dems have been advocating to do a select number of things better for longer, and we still believe that approach is the best path forward.” But a Manchin-approved version of the Build Back Better Act does not come without potential pitfalls. Manchin has raised concerns about the cost of the legislation and the impact on the national debt if all of its programs are made permanent. (Under the current version of the bill, many of its programs expire after a year or a few years.) The child tax credit, which was expanded under the coronavirus relief package signed by Biden last year, is particularly worrisome for deficit hawks. The current version of the Build Back Better bill calls for the expanded program to continue through 2022, at a cost of $185bn. However, if the expanded program is made permanent, as many Democrats would prefer, the 10-year cost of that policy would be $1.6tn, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Despite the cost of the policy, many Americans have come to rely on the monthly checks from the expanded child tax credit, and failing to extend the program could be disastrous for families’ budgets and Democrats’ electoral prospects. “If [Manchin] brings down the price tag below $1.75tn, if he cuts really popular things like the child tax credit especially or any of the pharma provisions, then that could be disastrous for Democrats,” said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. But Green argued there may be an upside to Manchin’s deficit concerns. If Manchin is determined to lower the national debt, it could provide an opening for progressives to advocate for revenue-raising proposals that they support, such as a tax on billionaires. “There’s actually a scenario where we raise $1.75tn and invest that money, and then on top of that implement a very popular billionaires tax, the majority of which goes toward debt reduction,” Green said. “What that would do is give Democrats this extremely popular talking point that we’re the ones who finally taxed billionaires.” Of course, that scenario will only be possible if Democrats are successful at bringing Manchin back to the negotiating table and actually getting a bill across the finish line. “Depending on how the negotiations go, Manchin’s current involvement could make things disastrous or very good for Democrats,” Green said. “It really depends on where things land.”",News/US news,Democrats could still salvage Build Back Better – and perhaps their midterm prospects ,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jan/08/build-back-better-democrats-midterms
1/8/2022,"Paul White, 35, Lancashire  In May 2018, I became leader of my local council, Pendle, in Lancashire. A year later, after nearly a decade in local politics, I quit. Alongside my council duties, I had been growing a business: milk and grocery delivery to 100,000 customers, locally and elsewhere in the country. I had a 3am milk round, so I’d be up before dawn delivering bottles, jumping on a train to Westminster after lunch to meet government ministers, and heading back to chair a council meeting that evening. My heart was constantly racing. Shortly before my election as leader, I’d been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy – heart failure. I’d been fitted with a pacemaker and defibrillator, and put on medication, but I’d torn up the doctor’s note, convinced I was too busy to take time off. I wasn’t bothered if my demanding life killed me. I was single and had no time for a family. After one 21-hour work day, towards the end of 2018, I told my mum I planned to quit; as soon as I uttered the words, I felt the weight lift. I moved to a barn conversion in Laneshawbridge, the Lancashire village I grew up in, and sold my stake in the business. For a while, I did nothing, which was an enormous and uncomfortable culture shift. Then I remembered dreams I’d harboured as a kid, when I’d draw maps of farms I wanted to own. I had studied rural enterprise at university, but the idea of working in agriculture got lost in business and politics. I’d kept an eye on the farming press and, in early 2021, still reeling from the pandemic, I spotted warnings of a turkey shortage at Christmas – a result of supply chain and labour issues stemming from Brexit. I rented an acre of woodland in the village, bought 200 turkey chicks for £2,000, and read up on how to rear them. I set up the business in three weeks, figuring I’d see a return in 20 weeks, when the local pubs and butchers were ready for their birds. Each day, I get up with my turkeys at dawn and close them in at dusk. I work alone, but I’ve learned a lot, educating myself on the job – the weird ways the turkeys react to noise, how much they eat, and how loud they are; farming with a hangover is a nightmare. I’ve rented 11 more acres and, this year, I’ll start a commercial flock of egg-laying chickens, then move on to sheep. When I was in politics, I thought it was the most important thing in the world. I was named Young Lancastrian of the Year in 2018, but, when I look back at photos, I seem grey, thin, ill. Now, I spend hours outdoors. I lead a walking group, and clock up even more miles with my dog. I tend to my turkeys by the river, and potter around the village talking to people. Before, my family were neglected. Now, my mum pops in for a brew after work, and I spend time with my baby niece. Practically, there are downsides to life on the farm: rain, animals die, and you have to be very smart to make a living from it: a £10 turkey chick can eventually sell for up to £90. Emotionally, it’s been hard to come to terms with the change. Handing over the keys to the town hall was a huge relief, yet I toy daily with going back – it feels like unfinished business. People who wanted my attention for years, whom I considered friends, disappeared. I’ve also found it hard to reconcile myself with the idea that I’m not contributing to the world or achieving in the same way: once you’ve tasted success, you feel compelled to fill your days with it. Now, I question if it’s OK for life to feel this simple. I suspect I will look for another endeavour alongside this one, but it will have to be just right. Everyone tells me how lucky I am to have made the leap. It is never going to make me rich in money but I think, in time, it could make me rich in happiness. Dawn Connor-Van der Horst, 49, Nijmegen, the Netherlands In the run-up to the Brexit referendum, the roads near our north Devon home were lined with red Vote Leave signs. I was strongly pro-remain and attended our local count on vote night. As the piles of paper grew, they confirmed my fears. In the early hours, I went home to my Dutch husband, Eric, and cried. Our sons, seven and 10, were in bed while we watched the result come through on TV. Eric turned to me and said: “I think we have to move.” By the end of 2017, we had left for the Netherlands. We never wanted to take the decision – nor could we have predicted how much we’d lose in the process. As a family, we identified strongly as European. We lived in the Netherlands when we were first married. When I fell pregnant and we moved home to Britain, it never felt like emigrating; we just rocked up and moved in. Leaving, a decade later, felt different, as if I didn’t belong in my own country. The entire campaign had been traumatic. I’d found myself in arguments with staff at nursery who held opposing views. Strangers had a go at my husband for speaking Dutch to our kids in the park. We ran a cycling business – organising biking holidays for tourists and cycle training in schools – and I remember one of our employees commenting, as we looked out over the rolling hills late in the campaign: “This country is too full, we need to leave.” There was anger and hatred on people’s faces. It was exhausting. We began to think about moving. We loved being European and wanted to be in the EU. Once we’d decided, we told close friends and gradually withdrew from our work and social lives. The hardest part was people who knew how hurt we felt and said nothing to comfort us. My husband lined up a job with a TV company, and we moved to Nijmegen, a city near the Dutch border with Germany. We were the first people in our new housing estate. The atmosphere felt cold; we all found it awful. Back in Devon, we had known our neighbours and fellow business owners. The boys had thrived in the village primary school, and enjoyed archery and surfing. After his first day of school in the Netherlands, my eldest son simply declared: “The horror.” The kids had never wanted to move, but I’d tried to make an adventure of it. I felt terrible for putting them in this position. My sister said that my youngest never smiled properly in the photos I sent. At his primary school, there was no allowance made for him being unable to speak Dutch. I tried to find them clubs, like they’d had at home, but it was difficult to make friends. I started teaching English, but I’d lost my support network – and as an adult, that’s hard to replace. My husband was relieved to slip back into a job he had done 10 years before. But four years in, our lives have shrunk and are much less interesting than they were. It isn’t that I wish we’d never moved – but there have been days when I’ve wished we’d never had to. I used to tell my children that they were still British and could go to a UK university. However, the rules are unclear and “Brexpat” campaign groups are now lobbying on behalf of teenagers who have been asked to pay international fees because they don’t attend British secondary schools, despite retaining citizenship. We’ve been back to the UK twice. What happened feels less personal than it did, but nothing has changed and I see no reason to return. We are not wanted there. We have grown accustomed to our smaller world. Materially, we are better off. We live in the biggest and best insulated house we’ve ever lived in, and have a new car for the first time. We’ve enjoyed holidays to Luxembourg and France. That’s the Europe I wanted on my doorstep. I still fight Brexit through campaign groups and social media. Trolls tell me I’ve moved and should shut up, but it’s not as if we walked off into the sunset. It’s sad to think of all that we built, and all that we lost. I’m reconciled with it – but it’s gone for ever. Raj Goodman-Anand, 39, Bangkok A few years ago, after my wife, Suvekchya, survived breast cancer, a therapist asked what my ideal life looked like. I was born in Kuwait, but was living in London. I said I wanted to live somewhere sunny again, near the sea, doing the job I love – but that I couldn’t. “Why not?” she asked me. When I broke it down, there was no real answer. I had moved to the UK at 18 and met Sue at university, in Brighton. We married in 2012, in Nepal, where she is from. In April 2016, she was given the cancer diagnosis. There were points where we didn’t know if she’d survive, and it changed our lives completely. It was the first time we’d realised our time was finite, that things change in a heartbeat. We didn’t want to miss a day, an hour. We made small changes. Sue turned vegan. I went from taking 280 flights in a year for work to making my entire company work remotely, long before Covid. Life was fun but fast-paced. The decision to sell up and leave was an accumulation of too many rainy London Sundays, £8 sandwiches, and days spent entering and leaving the office in the dark. When the pandemic hit, and followed by the birth of our daughter Raaya in September 2020, it cemented our ambition to get out and enjoy what we love: food, culture, travel. Instead of being stuck in our two-room apartment, we could keep the business going while working remotely from a beach with coconuts and beers. We left the UK on 30 January 2021 with our belongings packed into five bags. We sold our furniture, my beloved Brompton bike, and the wine, beers and artefacts I’d gathered on travels. Our UK friends and family were pretty shocked that we were doing it with a four-month-old baby; the only downside, now, is how much we miss them. We spent the first three months in Kathmandu with Sue’s family, trekking, eating great food and working flexible office hours. When Nepal introduced a lockdown and went on the red list, we extended our stay, spending two months indoors – but in contrast to our London lockdowns, we were living with family and had space. Travel restrictions prevented us flying directly to our next destination, Bangkok, so we spent a month in Albania. We rented Airbnbs in the capital, Tirana, then Sarandë on the coast, where the sea is turquoise. Arriving in Thailand was hard. Our daughter was quarantined for four days in a hospital room, because she had what turned out to be a false positive Covid test result, which was incredibly worrying. Really, though, that has been the only tough bit. There’s a rhythm to life here, now. We’ve rented an apartment, which will serve as a base to travel Asia. We hope to go to Malaysia, the Philippines, Japan – and I’d like to move to Latin America in the next five years. I spend mornings with the family, go to the gym, play paddle tennis or see friends. I start my working day about 3pm and break at 7pm, for a massage or some awesome Thai food, then I go back to work at 10pm for a couple more hours. Weekends are often spent at the beach. Meanwhile, the business has grown, partly because of the flexibility my staff and I enjoy. I know we will have to settle somewhere when my daughter starts school, but my idea of how that may look has changed. It wouldn’t have to be in the UK and it would no longer require me to work traditional office hours. Living the way we do has made me realise anything is possible. Raaya is growing up in a melting pot that is the entire world. And without cancer, our daughter, the pandemic, I’m certain we’d still be in London. Debbie Connolly, 58, Liverpool I had never been someone who could see a problem and not stop to help. I began fostering, in 2010, after volunteering with prisoners. I had been divorced for 11 years and was a single parent, raising my daughter, Megan, then 13. I was shocked by how many of the prisoners I worked with came from a care background. I saw the same pattern with homeless people, whom I would chat to and offer hot drinks when I was out shopping. I was eager to do something substantial to make a difference, so I made contact with a fostering charity, Tact. I knew that fostering would change our lives. As a lone carer, I would have to cut back on volunteering and my job, as a counsellor. It would also stop me doing some of the activities I used to enjoy, like going to the theatre, or out with friends. My daughter would also have to learn to share me with another child. First, we took in a teenage boy; then another after he left. When, in 2015, the charity asked if I’d take in a refugee, I knew it would be different, maybe harder, but I didn’t know what to expect. I was told there was a child from Eritrea. She had nearly drowned crossing the Mediterranean in a dinghy. She eventually arrived in Liverpool. In that moment, all I heard was that there was a child in need, and I said, “Yes.” Only later did I think about the language barrier, the culture shock, her trauma. Kokob arrived the next day, in the clothes she’d been wearing when she left Eritrea two years earlier; her shoes were two sizes too small. She looked terrified. She was about 13 – she had no paperwork, so she didn’t know when her birthday was; we began communicating through body language and expressions. Social workers placed her in a language school, with adult refugees, and I fought tooth and nail to get her into mainstream education. Within six months, she was speaking English, and opening up to me. My daughter was in her 20s and treated her like a sister. Kokob started calling me Mum and writing me Mother’s Day cards, which warmed my heart. She was never going to see her own mother again – I was the closest thing she had. I learned about her culture and diet, through books. I took up vegan cooking and found her an Eritrean church. I remember taking her to a restaurant for her birthday and discovering she’d never before celebrated one. A year after she arrived, I was asked to take in Ghidey, too – a 15-year-old boy, also from Eritrea. I’d never had a son, and he was affectionate and great at sport. He got on the refugee football team and then into Liverpool FC’s college. I felt immensely proud. Kokob and Ghidey were black children in a white family, but we never experienced racism. I’d walk into town with them both, holding hands, and we’d get the odd look, but mostly people smiled. One of Megan’s friends once asked, “How come Kokob doesn’t speak scouse?” Kokob was with me for four years, and Ghidey for three. They moved out as they approached 18. I invited them to stay, but they could receive better state support starting their independent lives young; now they both live near me. Fostering has been stressful at times. I suffer from fibromyalgia and osteoarthritis in my spine, so I had to consider my own health when faced with some challenging behaviour that comes from the trauma the children have endured. Even so, taking them in was the best change I ever made. When I think back, I’m struck by how nervous and vulnerable they were when they arrived, and how their confidence soared. Ghidey has a job, and Kokob is at college; she wants to be a chemist or a nurse. They still call me Mum and I think of them as my son and daughter. Kokob was at my wedding, last year, and at Megan’s two years ago. My husband, Andrew, has become an approved foster carer, too, so we can help more children in the future. Caring for refugee children gave me an appreciation of the things we take for granted – family, love, a nice home. Being able to make a difference in their lives has been humbling. Megan is 26 now. In job interviews, she tells people it is the most positive thing that has happened to her. It taught her empathy and gave her strength of character. A year ago, Kokob texted me out of the blue. She wrote: “I want to thank you for what you’ve done for me. You’ve given me so much. I love you.” That meant everything. Gino Scrigna, 31, Greater Manchester I was working 70-hour weeks in a concrete metropolis at the start of 2019. Every day, I commuted, by train and tram, into work where I managed teams of up to 50 people, serving thousands of delegates at Manchester’s convention centre. At home, my mind was constantly on my job. I convinced myself that things were good because I was putting money in the account, but I was so exhausted from working late nights, early mornings and weekends that my wife, Katy, was basically functioning as a single mother to our two children, then four and three. In June that year, my grandmother died, followed by my dad, three months later, both in Italy. Katy and I had been married for five years, and she was pregnant with our third child, but everything fell apart. The web broke. I spiralled into depression, gave up work and grew detached from people I loved. It was a wake-up call. I had grown up in South Africa and came to the UK at 21. My mum had left when I was three, making Dad my caregiver, but he had never spent time with me and had been emotionally unavailable. My only memories of him were as a workaholic. I had turned into him. If I didn’t change, my children would have no memories of days out or playing games with me, either. Katy made it clear I would lose them altogether. She’d been suggesting I change jobs for a while, and not long before Dad’s death, I’d answered an advert for a pizza chef, and got a job working in the woods at weekends. A guy, Adam, wanted someone to cook, on the back of a trailer, for walkers and local people on a beautiful seam of woodland near Cheshire. It was a way to earn some extra cash and try a different way of working. I enjoyed it, and I’d come home happier. When Dad died, I quit both my jobs and, by 2020, I’d run my family into debt. I hid it from Katy – everything was a mess. During the pandemic, I took a job in a scotch egg factory and, in summer 2020, picked up some hours serving gelato for Adam. By early 2021, his beautiful spot in the woods had become popular: all the time people spent outdoors during lockdowns had given it a boost. There was a coffee shack and tents, alongside the pizza oven, and hundreds of people were coming down at weekends. Adam offered me three days a week, and enough money to pay my bills. I left the factory, and made the forest my office. It was the change that Katy knew I needed. On Sundays, Katy and the kids – we have four now – come down, eat my pizzas and play all afternoon. On other days, they’re just 20 minutes away – waiting at the window for me to drive home and put them to bed. We have days out and play games together. I was conditioned to believe that the corporate world was the only way to stability. Now, I have emotional stability, and I’m working to break my generational curses. I wish the recognition had come easier – that I hadn’t had to make it all the way to the bottom to climb back up. But the alternative was a life with money in the bank and no family under my roof. It has been a steep learning curve. My life feels more balanced, and I spend my days in nature. My family doesn’t have the luxury of going on fancy holidays – but I can’t put a price on being in their lives.",Lifestyle/Life and style,Life after a great leap: lessons from people who dropped everything in search of happiness,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/08/life-after-a-great-leap-lessons-from-people-who-dropped-everything-in-search-of-happiness
1/8/2022,"Mark Rylance is dressed for rehearsals in loose black trousers and top, plus a puckish red knitted cap beneath which irrepressible tufts of dark hair sprout. His smile is wide, his face open, his dark eyebrows faintly saturnine – although heaven knows he can transform himself at will, creating Thomas Cromwell’s inward features and calculating mind, or Rooster Byron’s air of dangerous, Dionysian provocation. He was lucky during lockdown. Although theatres ground to a halt, film production was able to press ahead, and he made six – six! – films. First out was a student short (lucky students). Then there were a bunch of other things, including Don’t Look Up, which came out in December: a climate-crisis allegory about scientists trying to warn a heedless world of a massive comet about to hit Earth, with a ridiculously starry cast including Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep.  Here he is now, though, on his lunch break while he works in a deeply ungrand arts centre just south of the Thames in London. He is in rehearsals for a play called Dr Semmelweis that he has created with writer Stephen Brown. Tom Morris, he of War Horse, is directing. And Rylance couldn’t be happier. He has not worked on a play since Othello at the Globe in 2018. It has been the longest time he’s ever been out of a rehearsal room. “The first day here, oh God! It was so joyous to be in a room with other people. Theatre is so flexible and it’s so different from being an actor in a film. It’s a thousand times more enjoyable.” So speaks the actual winner of an Oscar. He won best supporting actor for his role in Steven Spielberg’s 2015 cold war drama Bridge of Spies, a role he was offered after “my friend Dan Day-Lewis brought Steven to see me doing Twelfth Night on Broadway. So, the first time I met Steven was in the basement of the Belasco theatre, where Houdini used to drop an elephant through a trapdoor into a tank of water to make it disappear.” A few weeks later, Spielberg offered him the part of the spy Rudolf Abel (to be fair, he’d tried to get him to be in Empire of the Sun in the 1980s, but Rylance turned him down). “It was a good part,” he says of Bridge of Spies. “And it got even better after Joel and Ethan Coen rewrote it. Looking at the two versions, it was like looking at the first and second quartos of Hamlet.” Throughout our conversation, he will refer to the world of movies – dining out with Joel Coen, exactly what it’s like working with Terrence Malick – as if it’s an amusing sideline, a hilarious hobby he has somehow stumbled into (“Really a funny fun thing,” he says lightly at one point). But film is not the point of his life; movies don’t do for him what the theatre does. Even working with Malick, playing Satan in the forthcoming The Way of the Wind, it’s not the same. It doesn’t have the same element of play, the same connection with an audience. Rylance, at this point in our conversation, suddenly takes on the role of Malick, leaping up to act out his directing technique for my benefit. Given that the famously publicity-shy Malick never does interviews and barely speaks in public, this is completely fascinating, and I can only apologise that the medium of print cannot do justice to Rylance-as-Malick’s breathy tenor as he conveys him darting around a cave in Malta with a GoPro camera, issuing instructions such as: “‘Ah, Mark, just take the script as a kind of indication of what you might say. Say whatever you want, really … Say: ‘God is beautiful’… No, say: ‘God is everywhere.’” The idea behind the play Rylance is rehearsing came after he read a brief, furious biography of Ignaz Semmelweis, written by Louis-Ferdinand Céline (the French novelist who became notorious for his antisemitic diatribes of the 1930s). Working as a doctor at the Vienna general hospital in the early 19th century, Semmelweis noticed that new mothers and babies had much less chance of dying from puerperal fever when they had been cared for by midwives and nurses than by doctors. Why? He eventually discovered that the doctors were attending to women almost in the same breath as conducting autopsies. If they thoroughly washed their hands, fatalities were drastically reduced. The trouble is, his discovery fell on deaf ears. He just wasn’t taken seriously. It would take Joseph Lister, Louis Pasteur and the use of microscopes to prove the existence of bacteria, 40 years later. The result, Rylance explains, was that “literally hundreds of thousands of women were killed accidentally by doctors. It’s an example of an incredible advancement in human understanding that doesn’t land.” Semmelweis, says Rylance, was “like the sharp knife in the drawer”; here he brandishes the available prop, an excellent wooden-handled, folding knife with which he’s attacking his salad. The doctor was, partly, his own enemy: he wasn’t a natural persuader; he was angry, impatient. The story isn’t as if written by Aeschylus, he tells me – the hero destroyed by a cruel fate – but more like something by Sophocles, the hero unwittingly complicit in his own downfall. Despite the fact that Rylance has been thinking about the play for years and that it was meant to premiere in the spring of 2020, the material – trust in scientific evidence and hand hygiene, for heaven’s sake – seems ridiculously prescient. Soon after Dr Semmelweis’s run at the Bristol Old Vic, Rylance will be on stage again, this time in London, with Jerusalem. The play by Jez Butterworth, directed by Ian Rickson, was a sensation when it premiered in 2009, running for 420 performances in London and on Broadway. A twisted pastoral marinated in the deep, dark mythology of England, it was an extraordinary piece of ensemble theatre lit up by Rylance’s central performance as the magnetic Johnny “Rooster” Byron, a character brimming with Falstaffian, punkish energies. It will be an event. Jerusalem is a “state-of-England” play, one that poked and prodded, albeit indirectly and allusively, at the politics of the time. It will mean something different again when it returns to a post-Brexit, austerity-hit, Covid-beset country. The original production was never filmed, except for archival purposes (“I’m not interested in filmed plays,” he admits). That means that for the past decade, Rylance’s performance has existed in the memory of those who saw it, which is the true essence of theatre: irreproducible. There was talk of turning it into a film, he says, but “I wouldn’t be interested in that. They’d have to get someone else to do that. It would be a dry bob, as some used to say.” (Later I find this phrase in a 19th-century Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, in which it is defined as “copulation without emission”.) For him, it’s all about being in the room with an audience. What made him want to go back to Jerusalem? Well, before TV and film, he says, actors used to return to their best parts, and tour them. If It’s a Wonderful Life had been a play, Jimmy Stewart would have reprised it endlessly, he reckons. Eugene O’Neill’s father, the actor James O’Neill, even called his summer house Monte Cristo Cottage after his most celebrated part, Edmond Dantès in The Count of Monte Cristo. “And if you’re lucky that will happen in your life as an actor, as it did with Jerusalem for me, and for Ian Rickson and Jez Butterworth, with the three of us moving into something that was greater than any one of us.” He would like to do it every decade. He is 61 now, and was 49 when the play premiered. Back then, in the first run, “I always said that I’d like to do it again in 10 years. I’d like to do it 10 years from now, if I can. I would like to do it at 71, and 81. I’d like to do it and see if it emerges into being something that’s more than just about that time when it hit so powerfully.” Micky Lay, the real person on whom Rooster was loosely based, now dead, was 74 when Rylance went to visit him in Pusey, Oxfordshire, proffering a bottle of whisky. “That was the second time: the first time he told me to fuck off, then I remembered that you always need to take a dragon a gift.” Most of the original cast has agreed to return, even those who had tiny parts, although the younger roles have been recast (the teenage characters needing to be played by young actors, plus some changes made to improve diversity, since times have moved on in other ways, too). Rylance was worried that Mackenzie Crook wouldn’t want to come back, but no, “he’s more fired up than I am”. He adds: “I had dinner with Ginger … ” – he uses Crook’s character’s name before correcting himself – “with Mackenzie the other night, the first time for maybe six or seven years, because he’s a very private gentleman. Ahhh, he’s a genius,” he says with disarming fondness, and chuckles. “I said to him: ‘It’ll be quite a moment when I say: ‘Morning Ginge,’ for the first time in front of people at the Apollo again.’” He is right. It will. Another anniversary is looming: this summer, it will be a decade since Rylance’s beloved stepdaughter, Nataasha van Kampen, died, aged just 28, of a suspected brain haemorrhage, on a flight from New York to London. Rylance had married her mother, the theatre composer Claire van Kampen, when Nataasha was very young; the whole family, including Chris van Kampen, Nataasha and her sister Juliet’s father, were very close. It was shortly before the London Olympics opening ceremony, which Rylance was supposed to begin with Shakespeare’s words from The Tempest, “The isle is full of noises …” Kenneth Branagh stepped into the breach. I ask him how he and his family are now. In the early, shocked days after her death, he tells me, they had an open house at their home in Herne Hill, south London: “Someone came who had lost a child 20 years before, and she said: ‘It never changes. This is it, it never gets better.’ And Juliet kicked Claire under the table, as if to say: ‘That’s not going to be us. There’s no way that ’Taasha would want us to stay in this absolute pit.’” It has, of course, been unspeakably hard. It was as if the family was a string quartet, he says, and they had suddenly lost a violinist; each of them had to learn to play the violin “and step in and play it” when needed, keeping Nataasha’s character, her spirit, her way of seeing the world close-held in the family. In fact, it was because she’d always been keen on his doing film work that Rylance started acting in more movies. “Though there’s not a day we wouldn’t wish her here, growing in the physical world, she feels both very far away and very, very near,” he says. “For me, love is stronger than death. And you know, we are very sad sometimes. But we’re also very happy sometimes, and we feel her come with us as much when we’re happy, if not more, than when we’re sad.” At a certain point during our conversation, I ask Rylance how he does it. How he acts, that is. Absurd question: you might as well ask a great chef how she cooks or a great soprano how she sings. But he answers seriously. He tells me about his teachers: Mike Alfreds who founded Shared Experience, and Philip Hedley, once artistic director of east London’s Theatre Royal, Stratford East. “They had digested Stanislavski, you had a real awakening of how you could layer and layer and develop things.” But it’s not quite that, he says. “What I am looking for is something that is moving. I am hunting for some engine … By now, at 61, I have discovered that my mind is really a helpful host into the room, but it’s not the cook.” There has to be something living, something playful, in the performance itself. And it comes partly, and powerfully, from the audience. He tells me about playing Hamlet at the Barbican in London with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1989. It was 5 June. He had seen the news: seen the footage of a man walking out in front of a line of tanks in Tiananmen Square, then stopping, right in their path. “And I remember coming on and saying: ‘The time is out of joint. O cursed spite, that ever I was born to set it right.’” In his imagination the auditorium itself, in that moment, became that line of tanks. “Or was it,” he wonders, “that a lot of people in the audience were also aware of that thought? That you might, at some point, find yourself in a time that’s out of joint, and be the one standing in front of the tank, stopping it?” Whatever it was, Rylance has a kind of extreme porousness that means worlds, not just words, can flow through him. And when he speaks those lines of Hamlet’s, I feel my stomach flip. It doesn’t matter how he does it. He just does. Dr Semmelweis is at the Bristol Old Vic from 20 January to 12 February.",Arts/Stage,Mark Rylance: ‘Theatre is a thousand times more enjoyable than film’,https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2022/jan/08/mark-rylance-theatre-is-a-thousand-more-times-enjoyable-than-film
