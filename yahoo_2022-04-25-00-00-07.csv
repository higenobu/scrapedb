4/25/2022,"Rep. Jamie Raskin said former VP Mike Pence's refusal to vacate the Capitol building was ""chilling."" During the Capitol riot, Pence's security agents tried to convince him to get into a car away from the premises. ""I'm not getting in the car,"" Pence told his lead security agent. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland said it was ""chilling"" to learn that former Vice President Mike Pence refused to leave the Capitol as insurrectionists stormed the building. During the January 6 insurrection last year, rioters, emboldened by former President Donald Trump, clashed with police and breached the Capitol building as lawmakers met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. Since the Capitol riot, lawmakers and law-enforcement officers have been coming forward to detail the trauma they say they experienced. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for example, said she thought she was going to be raped and killed. She said she and a staffer hid in the bathroom while a group of angry Trump supporters chanted her name. In the middle of the mayhem, it was previously reported that Pence, charged with leading the certification, refused to leave the Capitol. Secret Service agents swiftly escorted Pence into his ceremonial office, but they feared the rioters would shatter the room's glass windows. So they ""twice"" asked him to evacuate the building, according to an account of the events as reported by Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol D. Leonnig. ""I'm not leaving the Capitol,"" Pence said. He refused to get into an armored limousine. ""I trust you, Tim, but you're not driving the car,"" Pence told his lead security agent, Tim Giebels. ""If I get in that vehicle, you guys are taking off. I'm not getting in the car."" The moment stuck with Raskin, who serves on the House panel tasked with investigating the Capitol riot. Pence ""uttered what I think are the six most chilling words of this entire thing I've seen so far: 'I'm not getting in that car,'"" Raskin said earlier this week, according to NBC News. So far, more than 810 people have been charged in connection with the insurrection, according to Insider's database. In many cases, the FBI used social media posts to identify attendees. Leading up to the Capitol riot, Republican lawmakers plotted with Trump and his aides to stop Biden from taking the presidency, according to testimony from an aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. Raskin said the testimony brought forth before the panel will ""really blow the roof off the House."" Read the original article on Business Insider",Politics/Business Insider,Rep.

4/25/2022,"Racially motivated violence looks like the mass shootings that killed Xiaojie Tan, Daoyou Feng, Chung Park, Hyun Grant and Suncha Kim in Atlanta on March 16, 2021. Racially motivated violence also looks like suicide, which is defined as a deliberate act of self-directed violence in order to cause injury to oneself that results in death. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. When broken down by race, suicide is the first leading cause of death among Asian American young adults age 15-24. This is true of no other racial group in this age range in America. Despite this disparity, very little attention is paid by society and by gatekeeping institutions like academe and private and public funding agencies as to what causes suicidal behavior among racial minorities like Asian Americans. There is not enough research on how to prevent suicide among Asian Americans in particular. What makes this research more challenging to do is that Asian Americans are also the least likely racial group to seek and utilize mental health services. I am a doctoral candidate studying public health, with a focus on minority mental health disparities research. Here’s what I think is important to know about how violence, suicide and disparities all connect to affect Asian American lives. When an Asian American death occurs by suicide, it is not simply because that person experienced risk factors. Sure, the evidence suggests that the risk of a suicide attempt increases if there are easily accessible means such as guns in the home or if the person knows someone who died by suicide. But is that the full picture for Asian Americans, or even for other racial minorities? The truth is, the people who study suicide are still trying to come up with a profile of who is “at risk” in order to precisely predict, and ultimately prevent, suicidal behavior and death. Today, many research dollars go into the development of computer algorithms and genetic biomarkers to precisely calculate who is at risk. Will these methods do justice to the racialized experience of being Asian American in the U.S.? So the question now becomes: How can research scientists better understand and develop suicide prevention efforts that precisely address racial minorities like Asian Americans? To answer this question, there must first be research on Asian Americans to study. Unfortunately, the first, only and last study that assesses national epidemiological prevalence estimates of mental disorders in the Asian American community occurred and was published in the early 2000s, nearly two decades ago. Since these data were collected, the U.S. Asian population grew 72% by 2015, making Asians the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group, surpassing Hispanics. In my view, suicide among Asian Americans is a seriously unaddressed problem that could become endemic in a rapidly growing community with little to no direction on how to stop it. What if there was a way to scientifically account for racism as the fundamental cause of health disparities? The answer lies in understanding stigma. Stigmatized identity is arguably a universal phenomenon. People who are stigmatized are unwanted by society, negatively stereotyped, rejected and excluded, and ultimately othered. Asian Americans have experienced this kind of stigmatization institutionally since the early years of modern America as racial categorizations began to solidify. As America continues to racialize Asian Americans, it continues a legacy of structural violence and historical trauma. This means that anti-Asian violence exists within the very fabric of American society. It is this societal oppression and violence that becomes internalized into self-hatred, self-harm and ultimately the self-directed violence that is suicide. When it comes to being Asian in America, though, the story is incomplete with looking only at race. There are plenty of violently oppressive systems that Asian Americans face that pile on the risk of self-directed violence. These are intersecting in nature. It is the intersectionality, or cross-sections, of Asian American identity that must be closely investigated to uncover insights into suicide prevention for this incredibly diverse community. Being an immigrant and experiencing xenophobia, for example, is a dominant experience for many Asian Americans. Although many have lived in the United States for several generations, Asian Americans do account for a large portion of today’s adult second generation. Second-generation immigrants are people who are native-born citizens in the United States and have at least one parent who is foreign-born. What makes this important to know? Current trends indicate that the U.S. is explosively growing into an immigrant-rich nation. More than 36% of all Americans are projected to be of immigrant origin – that’s first- or second-generation – by 2050. By that time, the overwhelming majority – 93% – of the country’s working-age population will be of immigrant origin, too. Here’s the problem: Second-generation immigrants are considered an at-risk group for suicidal behavior and death by researchers across the world. Researchers aren’t fully sure why yet, and that’s why this research is so timely. Research takes decades to implement. It also takes decades to figure out the problem and how to address it. The public health scientists who work on disparities research are aware of the complex problems facing minority populations like Asian Americans. If there were an intervention to end racism and xenophobia, perhaps many Asian American lives would be saved both from homicide and suicide. The reality is that white supremacy runs so deep in America that even reversing racism would not undo the disparities in health outcomes such as suicide. This is because assimilation is “traumagenic.” That means the traumatic exposures of racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination hold the power to disrupt psychological and physiological functioning and alter genetic code for generations to come. Race-based traumatic stress holds the power to predispose entire populations, entire communities like Asian Americans, to self-directed violence. In my view, what is left to do is to work to change the norms of inclusion. It won’t take years of research to do that. Just start now. Act locally. Here’s a first step.

4/25/2022,"The crew of a superyacht dressed in designer clothes tossed by its owner, a worker said. The worker wrote in The Times of London that the owner ""never wears the same shirt twice."" ""Gleeful crew"" were ""scrubbing decks dressed in Armani cashmere jumpers,"" the worker said. A superyacht's crew dressed themselves in designer clothes that had been thrown away by its owner after he wore them just once, according to an industry insider. Writing in The Times of London, an anonymous worker with 20 years in the superyacht business told the tale of a superyacht owner ""who, much like the great tennis player Ivan Lendl, never wears the same shirt twice."" The worker said the owner ""couldn't understand the need for wardrobes in his master suite, stating, 'I buy it, I wear it, and I throw it away'."" They continued: ""It helped to explain why the gleeful crew aboard his yacht were scrubbing decks dressed in Armani cashmere jumpers."" The extravagances of superyacht owners have come to the fore after Western nations sanctioned Russian oligarchs over the Ukraine war. The sanctions seek to seize the trophy assets of oligarchs said to have ties to the Kremlin, including yachts, private jets, and luxury property. The superyacht worker writing in The Times also detailed the story of a crew that prepared fresh lobster for their yacht's owner every day, regardless of whether or not he was on board. Separately, a superyacht captain told The Guardian that employees aboard a wealthy Russian's superyacht were forced to take lie detector tests to prove they'd kept confidential information a secret. The employees were also banned from taking photos or making drawings of the superyacht, the captain said. Some oligarchs have had their yachts and private jets seized, while others have scrambled to escape sanctions. Last week, a Fijian high court granted an order to restrain a Russian oligarch's $325 million superyacht from leaving the island nation.
