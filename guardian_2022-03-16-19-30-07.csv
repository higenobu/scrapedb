3/16/2022,"Ghislaine Maxwell’s lawyers have said the juror who did not disclose childhood sexual abuse provided a dubious explanation for the omission as they once again requested a new trial. The juror, Scotty David, was questioned in court on 8 March about his lack of disclosure. David, who was Juror 50, told the judge, Alison Nathan, that he was distracted when he flew through a screening questionnaire for potential panelists. “The court has now heard from Juror 50 in his own words. If there is one thing we learned from Juror 50 at the hearing, it is this: he should never have been a member of this jury,” Maxwell’s lawyers said in their court papers. “Moreover, his answers to the court’s questions, which he gave after careful preparation by his attorney and under the protection of government-granted immunity, alternated between inconsistent, implausible, and contradictory, and at all times lacked credibility. “Juror 50’s explanation that he ‘flew through’ the questionnaire does not hold water, and his repeated after-the-fact assurances that the sexual abuse he suffered as a child did not affect his ability to be a fair and impartial juror were self-serving and simply not believable. “Like anyone in his position, Juror 50 does not want to be responsible for the retrial of Ghislaine Maxwell, so he attempted to give innocuous explanations for his false questionnaire responses and his decision to ‘tell his story’ to the international press following trial.” David said in court that his omission had been an “honest mistake” and he had not lied to serve on Maxwell’s jury. David was granted immunity to answer Nathan’s questions, having previously stated that he would invoke his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. “We had to be at the courthouse super early,” David told Nathan. “And I got here early and it took 45 minutes just to get through the security line.” When they finally got the questionnaires hours later, David heard “papers being ripped off the questionnaire packets” and people asking questions. “We just sat there for three hours. I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book,” David said. “I was sitting there, twiddling my thumbs, thinking about the breakup that just happened a few weeks prior and sitting in my feelings and not very focused.” A jury convicted Maxwell on 29 December of sex-trafficking and related charges for procuring girls – some as young as 14 – for the now-deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse. Maxwell maintains her innocence. Epstein, a convicted sex offender who once counted powerful people including Prince Andrew in his circle, was arrested in July 2019 for sex trafficking. He killed himself while awaiting trial in a New York federal jail. Maxwell’s watershed conviction was hurled into possible disarray following David’s post-trial interviews, in which he mentioned being sexually abused as a child. David said that he told his fellow jurors about this to help them understand facts from a victim’s point of view. David’s statements spurred controversy as potential jurors were queried about past abuse during jury selection. “Have you or a friend ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse or sexual assault?” was one such prompt on the questionnaire. After David’s comments emerged, prosecutors asked Nathan to conduct an inquiry into his statements, a request that was quickly echoed by Maxwell’s lawyers. Maxwell’s legal team has repeatedly asked for a new trial over David’s comments. In paperwork filed on Tuesday, prosecutors argued against a new trial, pointing to David’s insistence that he did not omit anything intentionally. Even if David had disclosed his past abuse, that would not have outright disqualified him from serving on the jury, they said. “After the thoughtful and thorough hearing held by this court, it is crystal clear that the defendant received a fair trial,” prosecutors wrote. “Juror 50’s sworn testimony at the hearing made evident that he did not deliberately lie in completing the questionnaire, but that he instead made an honest mistake. “The defendant cannot demonstrate that Juror 50 was biased. At the hearing, Juror 50 repeatedly denied that he harbored any bias or feelings one way or another with respect to the defendant or the government,” prosecutors also wrote. “To the contrary, Juror 50 consistently testified that he was fair and impartial in this case and that he rendered a verdict consistent with the evidence and the court’s instructions of law.” It is unclear when Nathan will rule on the attorneys’ latest arguments. Longtime attorneys have previously told the Guardian that a retrial is unlikely.",News/US news,Ghislaine Maxwell lawyers say Scotty David should never have been on jury,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/ghislaine-maxwell-lawyers-say-scotty-david-should-never-have-been-on-jury
3/16/2022,"When it comes to Covid, the United States specializes in denialism. Deny the human-to-human transmission of the virus when China’s first cases were publicized in late 2019. Deny that the virus is airborne. Deny the need for boosters across all adult age groups. There are many more examples, but now one stands out – learning from other countries. In early 2020, with the major outbreak in the Lombardy region of Italy that rapidly and profoundly outstripped hospital resources and medical staffing, Americans expressed confidence that it won’t happen here. That it couldn’t happen here. And then it did. Fast forward two years of the pandemic: the United Kingdom and Europe have provided five unmistakable warnings to America that a new surge was occurring. Within weeks, each time, the United States experienced a new wave, some not as severe (such as with the Alpha variant), some worse (Delta and Omicron variants). From this Covid track record over two years, it is palpable: what happens in the UK and Europe doesn’t stay in the UK and Europe. In the past couple of weeks, the UK and several countries in Europe, including Germany, France and Switzerland, are experiencing a new wave. At least 12 countries, geographically extending from Finland to Greece, are experiencing new increases in cases, some quite marked, such as Austria exceeding its pandemic peak, and Finland with an 85% increase from the prior week. Many of these countries are also showing a rise in hospital admissions. This is the sixth warning from the UK and Europe to the United States. Indications within the United States support the idea that new wave is already getting started. Wastewater surveillance is relatively sparse in the United States, but 15% of the 410 sites where it was conducted between 24 February to 10 March 2022 showed a greater than 1000% increase compared with the prior 15-day period. Also, the BA.2 variant is gaining steam in the United States and is now accounting for more than 30% of new cases. The root cause for the new wave is hard to pin down. Certainly, the BA.2 variant is known to have increased transmission, at least about 30% more than its sister lineage, Omicron BA.1. With the concomitant reduction of mitigation restrictions and waning immunity protection of vaccines, that transmission advantage will increase. This “BA.2 triad” of factors is thus hard to dissect, as they are clearly interdependent. Rather than focusing on what precisely is driving the new wave, the imperative is to drive some preventive action. As with the first five warnings from the UK and Europe, the United States did not take heed. Instead of proactively gearing up with non-pharmaceutical interventions (masks, quality of masks, distancing, air filtration, ventilation, aggressive testing, etc.), it just reacted to the surges when they were manifest. Now we are at a point with very low vaccination and booster rates, only 64% of the populations has had two shots, and 29% three shots. That puts the United States at 65th and 70th in the world ranking of countries, respectively. Indeed, the people who need protection the most, besides those who are immunocompromised, are the 65-plus group. The US has a booster rate of 65% in this age group, whereas the UK and many European and Asian countries exceed a 90% booster rate for people 65 and over. This is a critical issue, because there is a substantial dropdown of protection, from 90-95% with a third shot to 75-80% without a booster, versus Omicron hospitalization and death. The problem of lack of adequate vaccination in the United States is compounded by not having any plan for a fourth dose. The Israeli study of over 1 million people age 60 and over showed a 4.3 fold enhanced protection versus severe illness from Omicron compared with those receiving three shots. Not only is there a gaping hole in our immunity wall, but the $58bn budget of the American Pandemic Prepared Plan (AP3) advanced by the White House to comprehensively address the deficiencies was gutted by the Senate, reduced to $2bn, now threatening to cancel the order of more than 9.2m Paxlovid pills, the Test-to Treat program announced at the State of the Union address, along with better data, wastewater surveillance, efforts to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine, research on long Covid, and many other critical public health measures. We haven’t even seen a new, major variant yet, but there are too many reasons to believe that is likely in the months ahead, owing to extensive animal reservoirs and documented cases of spillover to humans, a large number of immunocompromised people in whom the virus can undergo accelerated evolution, rare but increasingly seen co-infections, and lack of containment of the virus globally. That, in itself, requires preparedness. Unfortunately, we have a mindset that the pandemic is over, which couldn’t be further than the truth, as I wrote about in the epidemic of Covid complacency. Add to all this is what is happening in China, which has fully relied on a zero-Covid policy, resulting in very little natural immunity, and vaccines that have weak efficacy against Omicron. Now this country is facing major outbreaks in two of its most populous cities, Shanghai and Shenzhen, and undoubtedly the whole country will be affected. We learned in 2019 that what happens in China doesn’t stay in China. The time for American Covid denialism is long past.

3/16/2022,"On 8 March, a jury took three hours to render a guilty verdict against Guy Reffitt, a January 6 insurrectionist. Donald Trump could not have been pleased. DC is where Trump would be tried for any crimes relating to his admitted campaign to overturn the election. Jurors there would have no trouble finding that the evidence satisfies all statutory elements required to convict Trump, including his criminal intent, the most challenging to prove. That is our focus here. A 3 March New York Times story asserted that “[b]uilding a criminal case against Mr Trump is very difficult for federal prosecutors ... given the high burden of proof ... [and] questions about Mr Trump’s mental state”. The clear implication is that justice department leaders may simply be following the path of prudence in hesitating to indict, or even to robustly investigate, Mr Trump. But based on the already public evidence – and there’s undoubtedly lots more that’s not yet public – no vigilant prosecutor would be deterred by the difficulty of convincing a jury about Trump’s state of mind. Full speed ahead is now the only proper course. The former president is vulnerable to charges of conspiring to defraud the United States, 18 USC §371, and obstructing a congressional proceeding, 18 USC §1512(c)(2). Regarding §371’s intent requirement, the US supreme court has ruled that conspiracies to defraud the United States include plots entered “for the purpose of impairing, obstructing or defeating the lawful functions of any department of Government” using “deceit, craft or trickery, or ... means that are dishonest”. The mental state required for §1512 is a “corrupt” intent to obstruct, influence, or impede an official proceeding. In Arthur Andersen v United States, the supreme court said “corrupt” meant “dishonest” or “wrongful, immoral, depraved, or evil”. The mountain of already public evidence would surely lead a DC jury to reject Trump’s defense that that he honestly believed his own “big lie” that widespread ballot fraud had deprived him of victory, and therefore that his intent was innocent. First, Trump knew that the 60-plus court cases seeking to overturn the votes in contested states had failed. Second, as the former Michigan US attorney Barbara McQuade has compellingly shown, five of Trump’s top officials told him unequivocally that all the fraud claims were false. Third, Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, told Trump the same thing during the infamous recorded call in which Trump asked Raffensperger to “find” 11,780 votes, exactly one more than needed to overturn the state’s election. That call alone screams “corrupt” intent. And the barely veiled way Trump threatened Raffensperger in that call reinforces Trump’s “evil” state of mind. Fourth, Trump’s speech immediately preceding the Capitol attack included a provable, telling lie – that he would join the Capitol march with the crowd even though his pre-speech schedule showed no such plan and Trump did nothing of the sort. A properly instructed jury would likely conclude that this lie reflected Trump’s desire to remain far from the violence he had encouraged, giving him both physical safety and plausible deniability and further evidencing a “corrupt” state of mind. Fifth, Trump’s failure for three hours to call off the siege after it began, notwithstanding violent televised images and entreaties from his children, advisers and allies – despite his undoubted duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed” – was manifestly “depraved”. Sixth, when Trump belatedly asked the insurrectionists to go home, he called them “patriots” who should “remember this day for ever”. A federal judge wrote in an 18 February opinion that “a reasonable observer could read that tweet as ratifying the violence and other illegal acts that took place that day”. Seventh, “willful ignorance” of incriminating facts is equivalent to knowledge. Drug couriers cannot escape conviction by having chosen not to ask what was inside the heroin-containing package they were handsomely paid to import. In Trump’s case, his purported belief in election-changing voter fraud was at the very least willfully blind to the facts before him. Finally, another of Trump’s anticipated “innocent intent” defenses – that he was relying on his lawyer John Eastman – would fail. Eastman has stated that it was on his advice that Trump sought to have Pence reject electoral votes for President Biden or to delay the entire vote. Even if Trump and Eastman had the requisite attorney-client relationship, which is dubious as a matter of fact, the defense has a gaping hole: under the law, Trump’s reliance must have been “reasonable”. Far from being reasonable, Eastman’s claim that that Pence was “the ultimate arbiter” of the electoral count was utter “nonsense”. Trump would be unable to produce any lawyer who supported that constitutionally absurd theory and could withstand even amateur cross-examination. A concluding point. Some observers have expressed fear that a single Trump-supporting juror could “hang” the jury, suggesting that the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, might just deem that risk to be too great to be worth running. But as the BBC’s observer of Guy Reffitt’s trial noted, every juror there saw through the smoke the defendant was blowing. Jurors are instructed to use their common sense, and the jury in Reffitt did just that. A DC jury would do the same in a trial of the conspiracy’s central actor. Once all the evidence is expeditiously gathered, with or without the special counsel that we recommend, the justice department must indict him.

3/16/2022,"The Ukrainian crisis has revived an old debate: how to effectively sanction a state like Russia? Let’s say it straight away: it is time to imagine a new type of sanction focused on the oligarchs who have prospered thanks to the regime in question. This will require the establishment of an international financial register, which will not be to the liking of western fortunes, whose interests are much more closely linked to those of the Russian and Chinese oligarchs than is sometimes claimed. However, it is at this price that western countries will succeed in winning the political and moral battle against the autocracies and in demonstrating to the world that the resounding speeches on democracy and justice are not simply empty words. Let us first recall that the freezing of assets held by Putin and his relatives is already part of the arsenal of sanctions that have been tried for several years. The problem is that the freezes applied so far remain largely symbolic. They only concern a few dozen people, and can be circumvented by using nominees, especially as nothing has been done to systematically measure and cross-reference the real estate and financial portfolios held by each of them. The US and its allies are now considering fully disconnecting Russia from the Swift financial network, which would deprive Russian banks of access to the international system for financial transactions and money transfers. The problem is that such a measure is very poorly targeted. Just as with conventional trade sanctions, which after the 2014 crisis were largely instrumentalised by the government to strengthen its grip, the risk would be to impose considerable costs on ordinary Russian and western businesses, with adverse consequences for the employees concerned. The measure would also affect a large number of bi-nationals and mixed couples, while sparing the wealthiest (who would use alternative financial intermediaries). To bring the Russian state to heel, we must focus sanctions on the thin social layer of multimillionaires upon which the regime relies: a group much larger than a few dozen people, but much narrower than the Russian population in general. To give you an idea, one could target the people who hold over €10m ($11m) in real estate and financial assets, or about 20,000 people, according to the latest available data. This represents 0.02% of the Russian adult population (currently 110 million). Setting the threshold at €5m would hit 50,000 people; lowering it to €2m would hit 100,000 (0.1% of the population). It is likely that a considerable effect could already be achieved by targeting those with more than €10m. These 20,000 people are those who have benefited most from the Putin regime since he came to power in 1999, and all the evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of their real-estate and financial assets are located in western countries (between half and three-quarters). It would therefore be relatively easy for western states to levy a heavy tax on these assets, say at a rate of 10% or 20% to start with, freezing the rest as a precaution. Threatened with ruin and a ban on visiting the west, let’s bet that this group would be able to make itself heard by the Kremlin. The same mechanism could have been used in the wake of the Chinese political crackdown in Hong Kong, and could be applied in the future for the 200,000 or so Chinese citizens holding more than €10m. Although their assets are less internationalised than those of the Russians, they too would be hit hard. It could destabilise the regime. To implement this type of measure, it would be sufficient for western countries to finally set up an international financial registry (also known as a “global financial registry” or GFR) that would keep track of who owns what in the various countries. As the World Inequality Report 2018 has already shown, such a project is technically possible and requires the public authorities to take control of the private central depositories (Clearstream, Eurostream, Depository Trust Corporation, etc) that currently register securities and their owners. This public register would also be an essential step in the fight against illicit flows, drug money and international corruption. So why has no progress still not been made in this direction? For one simple reason: western wealthy people fear that such transparency will ultimately harm them. This is one of the main contradictions of our time. The confrontation between “democracies” and “autocracies” is overplayed, forgetting that western countries share with Russia and China an unbridled, hyper-capitalist ideology, and a legal, fiscal and political system that is increasingly favourable to large fortunes. In Europe and the United States, everything is done to distinguish useful and deserving western “entrepreneurs” from harmful and parasitic Russian, Chinese, Indian or African “oligarchs”. But the truth is that they have much in common. In particular, the immense prosperity of multimillionaires on all continents since the 1980s and 90s can be explained to a large extent by the same factors, and in particular by the favours and privileges granted to them. The free movement of capital without fiscal and collective compensation is an unsustainable system in the long term. It is by questioning this common doxa that we will be able to effectively sanction autocracies and promote another development model.

The Church’s pensions board and the manager of its investment fund said they would reconsider their shareholding in the company. In a joint letter to Patrick Pouyanné, the chief executive of TotalEnergies, the pension board and the Church Commissioners for England said the company should urgently reconsider its position. The letter pointed out that while TotalEnergies had condemned Russia’s aggression, it had not followed many of its peers in the energy sector, such as BP and Shell, in withdrawing from Russia. In February, the Church of England announced it had sold all £20m of investments in Russian companies in response to what the archbishops of Canterbury and York described as Vladimir Putin’s “act of evil” in Ukraine. The Church Commissioners manage a £9.2bn investment fund while the pensions board manages a fund worth £3.7bn. It was not immediately clear how large a stake the Church’s funds hold in TotalEnergies, which did not respond to a request for comment. The joint letter follows two French non-governmental organisations – Greenpeace and Les Amis de la Terre (Friends of the Earth) France – saying they planned to take legal action against TotalEnergies over possible human rights abuses unless it cuts business ties with Russia. Russia represented almost a quarter of TotalEnergies’ reserves and 17% of its combined oil and gas production in 2020, according to company documents.

3/16/2022,"The path to my front door is wild. Tiny things spring from the cracks; moss creeps over the bricks, allowing foxgloves and mulleins to rise up and tower. Wild marjoram has danced from one side to another and is now taking on the top of the brick wall. Under the front step is a crowd of dandelions. I remember writing, many years ago, about my fight to get rid of these dandelions. Clearly, I didn’t win. Now, when I am greeted by them, I am glad I lost the battle. These days, I truly consider them friends. I didn’t always have a garden that was quite so full of wild things. I am sure many would think I need to do some weeding, but I won’t. Some I might nudge out of the way; some will stay; some will be outcompeted. If anything beastly moves in, I will intervene, but I have fundamentally shifted my position on weeds. They are welcome in my garden, because I know they do more good than harm. “Weed” is a vague term. It comes from the Old English weod and means a plant, a grass, a herb or a tree – anything that grows abundantly around us. That is to say, a plant that exploits our growing conditions, be that in an agricultural field, a back garden, a pavement edge or a park. Weeds are plants, often wildflowers – until they come a little too close and take advantage. Then they are weeds. They have been following us around since the Neolithic agricultural revolution, roughly 12,000 years ago. It is a long history, yet it is only relatively recently that it has become a battle. We started off with a very different relationship. Weeds were not things that needed to eradicated, but rather stuff we could gather and use. The ethnobotanical term for this is a cryptocrop: a wild plant that is useful to have on the edge of your field. The common names often tell of this; fat hen makes your hens fat, as does chickweed; sowthistle is good for lactating pigs and rabbits, hence its other name, hare thistle. All of these also happen to be delicious to humans, too. Red campion on a verge in Cornwall. (Photograph: AL Hedderly/Getty Images) For millennia, humans gathered, tended and used these so-called weeds so that they became a resource, either as a source of food (for their animals or themselves), a medicine or a material. Nettles, brambles and fireweeds all have a long history of being used as cordage. Many perennial weeds are very good at nutrient cycling, their long tap roots allowing them to mine minerals and nutrients from subsoil layers, which in turn helps to stabilise and improve soil for crops. They also protect soil; bare soil is easily eroded and damaged by the weather. All of this would have been noticed and noted, but as agriculture turned into agribusiness, and farms went from small mixed systems to larger segregated ones of arable or animal, our ideas of what could stay at the margins changed. As such, many cryptocrops became weeds. Then there was the rapid, widespread introduction of chemicals. Manufactured fertiliser meant weeds did better – before synthetic herbicides got rid of them. The landscape changed radically. This new order was quickly marketed to the home gardener; the postwar aesthetic promoted a clean and controlled nature. Two flower beetles pollinating herb bennet (left); a common blue butterfly feeding from a buttercup. (Photographs: Naturepix/Sander Meertins/Alamy) Weeds became something to be feared, to fight, to be defeated. But they are an adaptable lot. They evolved out of changeable environments, so they reached into their gene pools and found new ways around our chemical attacks. In any case, there is growing evidence that many herbicides are doing serious damage to our water, our soils, our wildlife and our health. The other way to remove weeds on a large scale – through tillage (ploughing, rotovating or digging) – degrades and damages the soil. Of course, weeds need to be managed, but there is another side to them that shouldn’t be overlooked. Many weeds are excellent for the environment because they feed others. Their flowers feed many insects; their leaves feed caterpillars, aphids and other soft-bodied things that in turn are the feed for other insects, birds and mammals. Come autumn, their seed feeds many wild birds. These unwanted plants support all manner of wildlife. There is growing evidence that even the ones considered noxious to agriculture – spear thistle, field thistle, common ragwort, curled dock and broad-leaved dock, which are controlled by the 1959 Weeds Act – are actually very good for nature. In fact, they are not just important, they are maybe disproportionately so compared with the plants we actively cultivate, be they garden or agricultural ones. That famous “weedy” nature – the ability to survive in places where other plants can’t – means they often provide considerably more nectar and pollen than cultivated plants or plant species recommended for pollinator-targeted agri‑environmental schemes (in other words, wildflower mixes). Think of buttercups that keep their flowers open on cloudy days, or the dandelions that arrive en masse when the bees are starting their colonies, or the bittercresses whose late-winter flowers are an important source of nectar and pollen to pollinators. Ground elder is a generalist pollinator and a food plant for several moths. (Photograph: Arterra Picture Library/Alamy) Many weeds are generalists, meaning they cater for many visiting pollinators, from bees and hoverflies to beetles and butterflies, with all their varying tongue lengths. They tend to have simple flowers and often grow in swathes; it is much easier for an insect to forage efficiently if it doesn’t have to fly far between food sources. Compared with many wildflower mixes, which tend to peak between June and August, weeds flower in cold and dull weather. At any point of the year, there is a weed in flower somewhere. Finally, they grow everywhere: in the shade, in the sun, on rubbish heaps, in the thickest clay or thinnest urban soils. You can buy wildflower seeds, but why not learn to love your weeds instead? That is what I have done as a gardener, philosophically and practically. I never see weeding as the chore that it is made out to be. It is a methodical practice that marries the hand to the mind, each weed with its own rhythm: the chase of a deep tangle of roots before they snap, the pleasure of the pop of a dock or dandelion, the easy pull of speedwell on wet soils. I can lose hours in this reverie. Sure, on wet or cold days, it is harder work, but it is deeply satisfying – and no more so in the fact that it is cyclical. You will be back on your hands and knees in no time. I let my weeds have my margins, to grow in difficult spots. Many are very easy to control just by removing the spent flower heads before they set seed. This way, the pollinators can get their fill and I don’t get overrun. The beastly sort – bindweed, brambles, dock – are rotted down in a bucket of water that drenches the compost and ultimately returns all the nutrients to my soil. Their rise and fall are part of the rhythm of gardening. Dandelions, nettles, lesser celandine, cleavers and creeping buttercup.

3/16/2022,"Home ownership was initially a pandemic silver lining for Kay Kingsman, a travel blogger based in Portland, Oregon. After Covid-19 put an indefinite hold on her usual globe-trotting endeavors, she’d spent the better part of 16 months working her tech industry day job from the house she shared with several roommates, wishing she had more space to herself. By last summer, a solution presented itself: her would-be travel budget had snowballed into a down payment’s worth of cash, while mortgage rates had dipped to record lows. “It seemed like the stars were aligning,” says Kingsman, 28. But she knew she needed to act fast. After a whirlwind month of house hunting, she made an offer on a Portland townhome in late July; it was only the second property she saw in person. A week later, Kingsman closed the deal and paid her new home a visit. It was there that she felt her first twinges of buyer’s remorse. The place wasn’t wrecked, exactly. “But it was so dirty,” Kingsman recalls. The sellers, who had vacated the property sooner than expected, hadn’t bothered to empty out the fridge or clean the stove; forensic evidence indicated that “they really liked oatmeal”. The carpeting stank of cat urine and had to be removed. Beard shavings littered the bathroom counters. Filth was the least of her troubles. Kingsman soon uncovered a murky legal conflict between the home’s previous owners and the HOA (Homeowners Association), which had culminated in a lawsuit that she learned about only after moving in. She’d inherited the petty, interpersonal aftermath: nullified parking privileges and the unearned resentment of her neighbors. This, it seemed, was her reward for persevering in a dog-eat-dog real estate market. “I thought it would be a good investment,” she tells me. “And then the first mortgage payment hit, and I was like, ‘Oh no. I am trapped.’” For the past two years, the US has seen a home-buying frenzy that goes beyond Zillow-scrolling sessions (a hobby meme-ified into cultural canon). Rocketing property values reflect the trend: data tells us the average American home was worth $249,000 in February 2020. Today, that figure is closer to $326,000 and projected to rise another 17.3% by next January. The stakes are high for prospective buyers; the expectations, often less so. With good deals fewer and farther between, a mere accepted offer is a victory in itself. Yet some recent home buyers, like Kingsman, regret taking the plunge. The phenomenon has attracted a stream of media coverage, fueled in part by a growing body of surveys seeking to quantify disgruntled new homeowners’ rising discontent. But for anyone paying attention, the sentiment is tough to miss. Real estate grievances are now a mainstay of online forums like r/homeowners on Reddit, where calls for commiseration are often phrased in question form and answered, in turn, by commenters’ consensus. “Anyone buy a money pit and regret it like I do?” reads one post’s header (the answer: yes). “How common is buyers remorse?” asks another (the answer: quite common). These buyers’ predicaments began with the pandemic. “People were definitely eager to buy, and quickly,” says Martin Orefice, an Orlando, Florida, real estate investor and CEO of Rent To Own Labs. By the summer of 2020, Orefice’s business dramatically increased. But even more striking than the sudden influx of house-hunters was their collective urgency to lock down a property – any property. “Instead of taking time to really shop around and make a decision, people were jumping on the first options available out of fear that someone else would take it,” Orefice says. Their concern was understandable. Buyers’ demand for homes far exceeded the available supply, a shortage that predated the pandemic. Nonetheless, the shift was striking. Before 2020, Orefice had never seen so many homebuyers agree to high prices without at least attempting to negotiate first. He also noticed that many buyers hadn’t so much as visited the property in person before making an offer, an observation that turned out to reflect a broader national pattern: a Redfin survey found that 63% of homebuyers in 2020 made an offer “sight unseen”. A year later, the landscape wasn’t much better. “The first house I saw, I was like, ‘oh, this is cute,’ says Kingsman. “It had just hit the market, and then it was gone the next day – someone made a cash offer. It was scary.” Economists attribute the souped-up real estate market to a cluster of factors, including low interest rates and the geographic flexibility afforded by the white-collar shift to remote work. But beneath those market variables is another very real, if less quantifiable, catalyst: human behavior in the face of uncertainty. “Buying a home gives people a sense of efficacy, taking charge of their lives and their futures,” says Dr Forrest Talley, a 20-year professor of psychology at the University of California-Davis who now operates a clinical practice in Folsom, California. “Unfortunately,” Talley continues, “for some, this is the equivalent of taking charge of a commercial aircraft that is experiencing turbulence. Unless you are a trained pilot, it’s best to stay in your seat and wait out the storm.” From a psychological perspective, in other words, it is less than ideal to make major life decisions when anxiety may be clouding your better judgment. But to state the obvious, these are profoundly anxious times, and most people don’t have the luxury of putting their lives on indefinite hold in hopes of a passing storm. As we enter year three of a global pandemic – on top of rising inequality, climate crisis and, now, the emergence of war in Europe – there is clear appeal in a semblance of stability. When the future is capped with a question mark, it makes sense to want to shape it. And what’s more concrete and proactive than making a home of one’s own? I’m as guilty as anyone of ogling fixer-uppers with purportedly good bones and a PO box in the middle of nowhere, indulging in a fantasy of myself that entertains company in an inviting living room, or throws a BBQ in my outdoor space. But for those who take the plunge, once the ink has dried on the property deed, drawbacks zoom into focus. The aftermath can be difficult to live with – on a practical level, and emotionally. “You invest so much hope and forward-looking feelings into a house,” says Heather Gates, 47. “When things go wrong with it, especially with the pandemic, it feels like the future is just kind of cut off from you.” Last October, Gates and her husband finalized their purchase of an 1880 Victorian in the upstate New York town of Canajoharie, a roughly four-hour drive from their Brooklyn apartment. The house hadn’t been occupied in 40 years and needed some work before it would be habitable, but it was solidly built and had a beautiful yard; Gates envisioned the garden she would plant in the spring. Crucially, the house’s relative proximity to a train station would make it easier for the couple to travel to and from Brooklyn, where they planned on keeping their apartment as a pied-à-terre. By the time I first spoke with Gates in mid-December, it was clear that the house was more of a fixer-upper than she’d bargained for. “I definitely went through a phase of genuinely hating it,” she told me, “but I’m on the other side of that now, I think? We were hoping to be moved in by now, so this can be frustrating.” More than two months later, the house has become a physical extension of two years’ worth of uncertainty and helplessness. Repairs remain ongoing, without an end in sight. Gates and her husband have yet to move in. “It feels very despairing,” says Gates. “Which is exactly the feeling that we were trying to escape from.” It seems that the garden will have to wait another year. Across the country in the Pacific north-west, Kingsman is trying to make the most of her situation. She says she’s working to reclaim access to her parking spot through a baroque legal negotiation with her home’s previous owners (“Who I’m still mad at for not cleaning up their beard shavings,” she adds). And, bit by bit, she’s sprucing up the space. “I’m doing the fun house stuff that you get to do, like paint the walls and put in new furniture,” says Kingsman. “So, that’s nice. But also, that money could have been spent in, like, Bali.”",Lifestyle/Life and style,They bought their first homes during Covid – and now they regret it ,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/mar/16/us-home-buying-ownsership-covid-pandemic-regrets
3/16/2022,"The recent, much-publicized wave of union victories in the US at companies as varied as the giant coffee chain Starbucks, trendy outdoor outfitters REI and media group the New York Times is spurring hopes that this will somehow turn into a much larger unionization wave that lifts millions of Americans. This is an unusually promising moment for unions, labor strategists say, as they strain to figure out how best to build a larger wave, although they acknowledge it won’t be easy because US corporations fight so fiercely against unionization. Union strategists are debating whether there are ways to transform the wins at Starbucks – workers at six Starbucks have voted to unionize so far – into a wave of unionization at McDonald’s and other fast-food companies, and whether the REI victory could be a springboard to victories elsewhere in retail, perhaps at Walmart or Whole Foods. “We have a moment right now,” said Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, the union that the REI workers voted to join. “I think that success breeds more success. When people see what’s happened at some Starbucks in Buffalo, they ask, ‘Why can’t we do that, too?’” His union is campaigning hard to win a rerun union election at the Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, but labor experts say it’s much easier for unions to win at a Starbucks with 30 employees or an REI store with 100 than at an Amazon warehouse with perhaps 5,000 workers and management running an all-out, anti-union campaign. “You have thousands of people who are standing up at Amazon wanting to be part of this movement,” Appelbaum said. “It relates to how people feel they were treated during the pandemic. Their contributions were not being rewarded sufficiently, and the risks they took were not being recognized sufficiently. Workers felt the callous indifference of too many employers. Plus, workers were concerned about the profiteering that was going on and the exponential explosion of income inequality. That we have such a pro-union president is helpful, too.” Moreover, workers feel unusually empowered because of the low unemployment rate and record number of job openings. It is a moment when many workers are making inquiries about unionizing (beyond the well-known efforts among grad students, adjunct professors and museum workers). Organizers say workers at McDonald’s, Target and Trader Joe’s are asking about unionizing. That first union victory at a Starbucks in Buffalo, New York, in December has led to workers at 140 Starbucks in 27 states petitioning for unionization votes. What is happening at Starbucks is the wildfire that union organizers dream of – an organic, bottom-up, fast-spreading effort. Erica Smiley, executive director of Jobs with Justice, a labor rights group, said all this worker energy is great. But acknowledging how fierce anti-union campaigns can be, she said: “The pressure is on us as a movement to help move this forward. It’s really an uphill battle.” The recent string of lopsided union wins was impressive and inspiring: 88 to 14 at REI in Manhattan, 25 to three at Starbucks in Mesa, Arizona, 404 to 88 among New York Times tech workers, and 142 to 44 at the Art Institute of Chicago. These victories came despite vigorous anti-union campaigns by management. “We’re in a moment when we are questioning how effective traditional union-busting tactics are,” said Rebecca Givan, a labor studies professor at Rutgers. “Traditional union-busting tactics like scaring immigrants and dividing workers by race – how effective they are has been brought into question.” Givan said workers at Starbucks stores that have unionized speak with workers at other Starbucks to inoculate them against anti-union efforts by telling them what anti-union message and tactics to expect. While the recent union wins fuel optimism, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in January that just 10.3% of US workers are in unions and just 6.1% in the private sector. In the 1950s, more than one in three private-sector workers were in unions, in the 1980s, more than one in five. Now it’s just one in 16. Tefere Gebre, who recently stepped down as executive vice-president of the AFL-CIO, the nation’s main labor federation, said unions were doing far too little to seize the moment and unionize workers. “Workers want unions, but the question is, do unions want workers?” Gebre said. “If you talk to any labor leader, they’ll tell you, “That’s what we’re really for. We want members.’ How you mechanize that is a different thing.” Gebre said far too many union leaders don’t want to stick their necks out and spend members’ dues money on unionizing more workers. “Right now we have fiefdoms that people think are big enough,” Gebre said, warning that if union membership continues to decline, unions will inevitably lose clout. “For far too long our growth strategy has been entirely attached to politics, but that has failed us over and over,” Gebre said. A Republican filibuster has blocked Joe Biden’s push to enact the Pro Act, which would make it easier for workers to unionize. Gebre said the nation’s unions should send far more organizers and money to back the union drives at Starbucks and Amazon. “The rest of the labor movement should be willing to lend a hand,” even if they don’t get any of the members, said Gebre, who was recently named Greenpeace’s chief program officer. “That’s what solidarity means.” Unions have often balked at organizing small workplaces like restaurants with a few dozen workers, preferring to focus on larger workplaces. In addition to seeking a $15 wage, the Fight for $15 – which was largely financed by the Service Employees International Union – sought to pressure McDonald’s to agree to remain neutral and not oppose unionization. That might have allowed efforts to unionize dozens of McDonald’s and hundreds of McDonald’s workers at once, but McDonald’s rejected pressures to agree to neutrality. Workers United, the union that is organizing Starbucks, is an Service Employees International Union (SEIU) affiliate, but has taken a different approach. “It’s better to organize 10,000 workers at a time than 25,” said Erik Loomis, a labor historian at the University of Rhode Island. “But the more 25s you organize, the more people will see that success and gain confidence to take action themselves. You’re seeing that with Starbucks.” Givan said the Starbucks victories might inspire workers at McDonald’s, Chipotle and other fast-food companies to seek to unionize, and if just one or two of those restaurants unionize, it could spur many workers at those chains to seek to do likewise, especially in union strongholds like Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Seattle. “We don’t have the luxury as a movement to be picky on strategy,” said Smiley of Jobs with Justice. “At this moment, we have to let every flower bloom – not in a way that will burn the future, but in a way that will crack open the door to allow us to think a little differently.” Stephen Lerner, architect of the SEIU’s groundbreaking Justice for Janitors campaign, said it was exciting that Starbucks workers are organizing and winning elections. But he said that even when workers win union elections, corporations often drag their feet for years before ever reaching a union contract, that is, if they ever agree – a strategy that hugely frustrates workers. “That’s why to beat giant corporations, you need comprehensive campaigns,” Lerner said. “We need giant campaigns to pressure giant companies at multiple levels to make sure they negotiate and reach good contracts.” Seeing how intense anti-union efforts can be, many labor leaders resist calls that they do more organizing if unions are ever to grow larger and stronger. “Organizing at any place is too hard,” Gebre said. “In the entire history of the labor movement, it’s never been easy. But that’s what unions are there for: to do the hard work.”",News/US news,US unions see unusually promising moment amid wave of victories,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/us-union-victories-wave-labor-strategists
3/16/2022,"While New York City’s mayor, Eric Adams, has been defending his veganism and equating drug dependency to liking cheese, he has been escalating the city’s police powers, deeply concerning civil rights advocates. Adams, the second Black person to serve as New York mayor, largely won the mayorship through securing the votes of Black, brown and working-class New Yorkers. Crime was an important issue in the election (and since then), and Adams’s politically moderate solutions to crime, with an emphasis on critiquing the flawed New York police department but without campaigning on defunding or switching some funds away, swayed voters. But despite garnering support from top Democrats such as Joe Biden and New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, Adams’s vast expansion of controversial policing tactics and calls for deep cuts to New York’s affordable housing and homelessness services have left many anxious about his impact on the very coalitions that elected him. “Mayor Adams is basically reigniting some of the worst parts of the NYPD, which is saying a lot,” said Jerome Greco, the digital forensics supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society. Amid calls to ban drill music (an initiative Adams has since walked back) and billboards calling for the end of sagging pants style, Adams has reinstated New York’s infamous plainclothes unit, an anti-crime squad of officers dressed in civilian clothing and tasked with targeting violent crime. Adams, who published a blueprint to end gun crime last month, promoted the plainclothes unit as a means to aggressively target gun crime, but Adams’s reinstatement of the units via newly minted “neighborhood safety” teams has been met with criticism given their legacy of violence. Before being disbanded by the then NYPD commissioner, Dermot Shea, in 2020, New York’s anti-crime units had a long history of misconduct and excessive, targeted policing against minority communities, said Greco and Michael Sisitzky, senior policy counsel at New York Civil Liberties Union. Many of the recruited officers on the selective units had lengthy histories of misconduct and aggression against residents, said Sisitzky. Plainclothes unit officers were also involved in a shocking and disproportionately large number of killings, with a study by the Intercept finding that in 2018, plainclothes officers were involved in 31% of fatal police shootings despite accounting for just 6% of the force. For many, a searing argument for disbanding the units was the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo in the Bronx. After claiming that Diallo fit the description of a wanted rapist, officers shot at him 41 times, claiming later that he had been reaching for a gun. Diallo, who was actually reaching for a wallet, was struck 19 times and killed. All involved officers were acquitted. But since then, plainclothes officers have been involved in other high-profile killings. Eric Garner, whose 2014 death made international headlines and sparked worldwide protests against police brutality, was killed by NYPD plainclothes officer Daniel Pantaleo, who put Garner in a banned chokehold. In 2018, anti-crime officers also killed Saheed Vassell, 34, who neighbors say was known to local patrol officers as having mental health problems. “This is the legacy that could be revived with these new so-called Neighborhood Safety teams,” said Sisitzky. While Adams and the newly minted NYPD commissioner, Keechant Sewell, have promised that officers in the reinstated units would be vetted this time around for “emotional intelligence”, experts say past training has failed to yield reform. “The plainclothes units were disbanded for a good reason and to bring them back as if those problems never existed or that somehow he’s going to be able to prevent those problems is unrealistic,” said Greco. Adams also pledged to increase the use of facial recognition technology (FRT) to identify culprits of crime despite widespread pushback over the technology’s efficacy and use by police. While posited as a tool to solve serious crime, critics have argued that such technology, in addition to being disproportionately used on New York’s minorities, is inaccurate. More FRT is placed in non-white areas of New York, despite the technology being notoriously inaccurate at identifying Black and Asian people. So far, all noted false arrests stemming from inaccurate FRT have been of Black men, and Sisitzky has warned that an expansion of the technology could lead police to confront civilians on the basis of false information. “We’re talking about the potential for life-changing or life-ending consequences,” he said. The NYPD, as noted in the blistering 2019 report Garbage in, Garbage Out,published by privacy lawyer and senior associate with the center on privacy & technology at Georgetown Law Clare Garvie, will also sometimes doctor poor-quality photos captured by FRT or submit celebrity photos, artist sketches, and other images into the technology to garner suspect matches. There are no rules of what images officers are allowed to use. Use of FRT by the NYPD (which would be responsible for rolling out the technology’s expansion) over the past decade has also prompted at least six lawsuits, reported Politico, mainly over the NYPD’s disclosure of their FRT practices. The NYPD has claimed that facial recognition has helped solve a number of serious crimes, reporting that FRT led to 2,878 arrests between October 2011 and 2018 out of 3,817 searches, but experts have argued that such stats do not disclose if matches were made on the basis of photo editing or using reference images. Attempts to mandate public reporting from the NYPD about FRT have also been ineffective, said Greco and Sisitzky. Sistzky said that even under New York’s June 2020 Public Oversight of Surveillance Technology Act, the NYPD failed to be fully transparent, minimally addressing concerns about inaccuracy in the technology, what outside entities had access to FRT information, and other critical information, prompting many advocates to call for a ban. “It’s gotten to the point where we just don’t think there is a responsible way for the NYPD to use it,” said Sisitzky. Given Adams’s promises to fight crime, progressives and activists on the left remain skeptical of the mayor’s chosen methods, especially given the proposed reduction of money to New York’s housing services. A total of $615m has been cut from homelessness services despite ballooning levels of homelessness and a campaign promise to fund the department with $4bn. While much of the budget reductions are due to reduced federal Covid-19 aid, advocates said they will challenge budget reductions as New York’s homeless crisis rises. As the social aftereffects of the Covid pandemic, especially factors such as soaring rent prices and record overdose rates, become increasingly clear, critics have warned that only a serious investment in social services and rethinking of police-centered community intervention methods can address crime rates while protecting vulnerable communities. “If they really were serious about dealing with these issues, they would better fund the social services and utilities that people need and help them in ways that truly would lower any crime and actually be beneficial,” said Greco.",News/US news,"New York mayor’s crime plans reinforce ‘worst parts of NYPD’, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/16/eric-adams-new-york-city-crime-police
3/16/2022,"“So let me get this straight. If some guy lives longer than you predict, I have to keep on paying?” The question came from the manager of the pension fund for a state-owned Russian company. He was in London on a fact-finding mission to learn about private pensions. He had just heard an actuary explain how it worked. The Russian manager was suspicious of a system with such open-ended liabilities. I was interpreting and passed on his question. The actuary confirmed that the longer a pensioner lived, the more he got paid. The Russian client folded his hand into half a fist, with two fingers extended to imitate the barrel of a gun, which he pointed to the ground. “Couldn’t you just, you know, take care of the guy?” I translated. The actuary looked at me for confirmation that it was a joke. Yes and no. This was the mid-1990s. Here was someone who had manoeuvred himself through the ruins of the former Soviet Union into control of a vast pot of other people’s money. He wasn’t a big-time oligarch, but he was one of the winners from a transition that had left most Russians feeling like losers. The point was not about pensions but power. Why pay if you don’t have to? What’s in it for the boss? The British advisers smiled awkwardly and changed the subject. A lot has changed since then. Russia stopped trying to be a democracy, then stopped pretending to try. Britain stopped advising Russians on how to run a market economy within the rule of law, then stopped pretending to care how they made their money. If the question ever came up when the super-rich came shopping for mansions in Belgravia, or premier league football clubs there was a lot of smiling awkwardly and changing the subject. A common western misconception in those early years of Russia’s post-Soviet transition was that people who had grown up under communism didn’t understand capitalism. That overlooked the importance of market forces to Soviet society, operating on many levels. There was the thriving trade in illicit goods, controlled by criminal gangs who also bought protection from authorities. Police indifference comes at a price. There was the commerce in favours, either as barter or cash in hand, wherever a bureaucratic door needed opening. People who gamed that system in the days when making a profit was ideologically taboo didn’t need lessons in market forces when getting filthy rich turned legit. KGB officers and party apparatchiks who became millionaires did not struggle to shake off the precepts of Marxism-Leninism. There is a tendency to sequence Russian history over the past generation in lurches: the collapse of Soviet power into the anarchic Boris Yeltsin era, then the slump back to authoritarianism under Vladimir Putin. But running all the way through has been a common ethos that sees all politics as a negotiation between the people who have found a way to get rich and the officials who can either help or obstruct them, and set the price. It is always a transaction between money and state power. Ideology hardly enters into it. That cynicism is deeply entrenched and projected outwards on to all countries and all jurisdictions. I spent years in Russia and countries of the former Soviet Union, as a student, doing interpreting gigs, then as a correspondent, from the mid-1990s onwards. I used to get into this argument all the time. I would explain that things worked differently in the west – that democracy involves a different kind of relationship between wealth, parliaments and power. That claim was routinely met with polite scepticism or outright derision. As if only a child would believe such political fairytales. A dispiriting trend in recent years has been hearing the same caustic cynicism in the UK. And the more Russian money moved into Britain, the more enmeshed rich Russians became with London’s social, political and economic elite, the harder it got to argue that democracy operated to a higher standard; that its rules weren’t soluble in money; that the system didn’t always yield for rich friends of the boss. That is why Evgeny Lebedev’s appointment to the House of Lords was so damaging even before it was revealed that UK intelligence agencies had a concern that the nomination posed a risk to national security. When Boris Johnson nominated his friend for a peerage in July 2020 the brazenness of the favour attracted more comment than the Russianness. Then the fuss died down. It was hardly the first time that a seat in the Lords has been given to the friend of a prime minister. There are beneficiaries with thinner records of charitable benevolence than the one Lebedev’s friends cite to justify his ennoblement. He is not a Tory donor. (Other Russians with dual British nationality have funnelled millions into Conservative coffers.) It can’t be a case of cash for honours when there was no cash. The House of Lords appointments committee didn’t like the Lebedev peerage but the prime minister was unmoved. He thought the objection expressed anti-Russian prejudice. The intelligence services changed their assessment of the risk. Spooks get stuff wrong. Did they just smile awkwardly and change the subject when the prime minister insisted on making his pal a peer? Alexander Lebedev, Evgeny’s father and the source of his wealth, was once a KGB agent. But that isn’t a hereditary condition. His attitude to the Kremlin might be described as temperate. In a 2016 article for the Standard Alexander conceded that oligarchs had plundered Russia and also “sad to say, some of them are close to Putin”. But he insisted that the president himself was “not behind the looting”. Lebedev Jr has said things in the past aligning with Kremlin views on the 2014 annexation of Crimea and casting doubt on the official UK account of the Salisbury poisoning, but that isn’t sedition. The newspapers he controls have come out against the invasion of Ukraine. His attraction to a seat in the Lords may be motivated by nothing more than vanity in collecting a limited edition ermine robe. (He hasn’t voted or spoken in a debate since his maiden speech.) His friendship with Johnson is probably in the same category – a prime minister as high-end collectible. But if that is the case, and the security services were making a fuss over nothing, there is still harm done. The spectacle is depressing, not because Baron Lebedev of Hampton in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames and of Siberia in the Russian Federation is Russian, but because the absurd title and the corrupt process that created it bolster the most caustic, cynical view of the way British politics works. And at a time when we need to spread confidence that democracies do things better.

3/16/2022,"Good morning. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, will deliver a virtual address to the US Congress today, the latest in a series of speeches to western leaders as he works to galvanize support for his besieged nation. The remarks to both chambers of Congress come on day 21 of the battle for Ukraine’s survival under an intensifying assault from Russia. Russian troops are advancing on the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in a war that has already killed hundreds of civilians in aerial and artillery bombardment, including at least 100 children. More than 3 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion, causing the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. How are the negotiations with Russia going? Zelenskiy has said he sees possible room for compromise in talks with Russia before a fresh round of discussions. But he added that more time was needed for negotiations to bear fruit. What happened to the Russian journalist who carried out a live broadcast protest? A Russian court has fined Marina Ovsyannikova 30,000 roubles (£215). The fine was a relatively light sentence for an act of protest that shocked Russian television viewers and earned plaudits from western leaders. What else is happening? Here’s everything we know on day 21 of the invasion. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four co-defendants accused of planning the 9/11 attacks are reportedly in talks with US prosecutors over a potential plea deal in which they would plead guilty in exchange for avoiding the death penalty. The New York Times reported that negotiations were under way for a possible plea agreement that could bring to an end what is arguably the biggest criminal case in US history. The five defendants were first charged in 2008 with plotting or logistically supporting the terrorist attacks that led to the murder of almost 3,000 people at New York’s Twin Towers, the Pentagon in Washington, and in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. Pre-trial procedures under the so-called military commissions that were specially devised for the terror suspects held at Guantánamo Bay have been going on for more than a decade. What has caused the delay? Lawyers have been consistently bogged down in technical and ethical disputes, foremost of which has been the long-running debate over whether the defendants can ever receive a fair trial given the torture to which they were subjected. A new US Secret Service report details a rising threat from men who identify as “involuntary celibates” or “incels”, due to their inability to form intimate relationships with women. The report released yesterday and prepared by the National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) highlights behavioral threat assessment themes identified in years of research examining targeted violence. Themes include concerning and threatening communications, concerning online content, chronic and acute stressors, elicited concern in others, interpersonal difficulties, history of being bullied, financial instability, failed life aspirations and lack of consequences. As a case study, the Secret Service examined a 2018 shooting at a yoga class in Tallahassee, Florida, in which a man killed two women and wounded six. What does the report say? The agency noted that misogynistic violence is not restricted to high-profile incidents of mass violence. Rather, “misogyny frequently appears in more prevalent acts of violence, including stalking and domestic abuse.” What do they recommend? The report said responses to threats need to be collaborative between law enforcement, courts, mental health providers and domestic violence and hate crime advocacy groups. Nearly a month after its launch, Truth Social, Donald Trump’s new social media network, has become a laughing stock, marked by a botched rollout, a share price collapse and, in Trump, a figurehead who doesn’t actually post much to his own social media platform. Doug Emhoff, the US second gentleman, has tested positive for Covid-19, the White House announced yesterday. The vice-president, Kamala Harris, tested negative but is curtailing her schedule as a result of her husband’s positive test. No charges will be filed against the Chicago police officers who chased and fatally shot 13-year-old Adam Toledo and 22-year-old Anthony Alvarez within days of each other last year, prompting sharp criticism of how the department handles foot pursuits, a prosecutor announced yesterday. Lu Yuguang, of the Chinese news outlet Phoenix TV, appears to have gained exclusive access to Moscow’s side of the invasion of Ukraine. The Guardian is not aware of any other foreign journalists reporting from such close quarters on the Russian side of the invasion. The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates for the first time since 2018 as it struggles with soaring US inflation, the impact of the war in Ukraine, and the continuing coronavirus crisis. With inflation rising around the world, the Fed is expected to announce it will follow other central banks, including the Bank of England, and raise rates by a quarter percentage point. The Fed chair, Jerome Powell, will hold a press conference today to discuss future plans. For the past two years, the US has seen a home-buying frenzy that goes beyond Zillow-scrolling sessions (a hobby meme-ified into cultural canon). Rocketing property values reflect the trend. The stakes are high for prospective buyers; the expectations, often less so. With good deals fewer and farther between, a mere accepted offer is a victory in itself. Yet some recent homebuyers regret taking the plunge. Long-term exposure to air pollution can increase the risk of autoimmune disease, research has found. Exposure to particulates has already been linked to strokes, brain cancer, miscarriage and mental health problems. Now researchers at the University of Verona have found that long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution is associated with an approximately 40% higher risk of rheumatoid arthritis and a 20% higher risk of inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis. The Republican senator Josh Hawley must stop using an infamous picture of him raising his fist to protesters at the US Capitol on January 6 on campaign merchandise, the news site Politico said. The shot, taken by E&E News, which Politico bought in December, was taken on 6 January 2021 as Hawley, from Missouri, made his way into the Capitol for the certification of electoral college results in Joe Biden’s victory over Donald Trump.

3/16/2022,"The drinks maker Fever-Tree and the owner of the Wagamama and Frankie & Benny’s restaurant chains have warned of dramatic cost increases as the price of commodities and gas and electricity soars and the war in Ukraine adds pressure to their businesses. Fever-Tree has lowered its profit guidance, blaming a “dramatic increase” in commodity prices after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company, which had forecast adjusted profits of £69m to £72m this year, has now downgraded its outlook to between £63m and £69m. “There remains a global backdrop of inflationary pressures against which we are employing a range of mitigating actions,” Fever-Tree said. “However, commodity prices have increased dramatically in recent weeks because of the terrible events in Ukraine and has created significant uncertainty in relation to input costs.” Fever-Tree, which reported a 23% increase in revenues to £311m and an 8% rise in pre-tax profits to £55.6m last year, reassured investors that it was managing its ballooning cost base, which has hit margins. Operating expenses increased by almost 15% to £67.9m last year, as the company’s margins shrank from 22.6% to 20.2%. “The tragic situation in Ukraine has resulted in significant uncertainty in relation to our input costs in the short-term,” said Tim Warrillow, a co-founder and the chief executive of Fever-Tree. “[However], the long-term global opportunity for Fever-Tree remains substantial and we are as confident as ever in the brand’s ability to capitalise on this.” The Restaurant Group (TRG) – which operates 400 restaurants and pub restaurants throughout the UK, and also runs concessions mostly in airports under brands including Garfunkel’s, the Tex-Mex chain Chiquito, Brunning & Price and Coast to Coast – expects its costs to rise by more than 5% this year because of price increases in commodities and supply chain pressures. TRG pointed out that this was before any additional inflationary impacts from the conflict in Ukraine, as Fever-Tree has already seen. “While we have no direct exposure to either Ukraine or Russia, it remains too early to assess the impact on supply chain costs and customer behaviour,” the company said. “Management’s current expectations for 2022 remain unchanged, although we are mindful about the consequential inflationary impacts arising from the conflict in Ukraine. We are, however, doing everything we can to offer support and assistance to our UK-based Ukrainian and Russian employees.” TRG said the soaring cost of gas and electricity will add an additional £6m to £7m to its expenses this year. The company has attempted to mitigate costs by hedging 95% of its gas and electricity volume for this year, and 75% in 2023 and 2024. The company also warned on rising wage costs as the economy nears full employment with well over 1 million vacancies in the UK. “This shortage of labour across the UK is leading to upward pressure on wage rates,” it said. TRG’s share price rose almost 10% in early trading as the company continues to recover strongly from the pandemic, while Fever-Tree fell 2%. In the eight weeks to 27 February, sales at Wagamama were up 21% compared with pre-pandemic levels for the same period in 2019, while its pubs operation was up 11%.",News/Business,Wagamama owner and Fever-Tree warn of cost increases as energy prices soar,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/16/wagamama-owner-and-fever-tree-warn-of-cost-increases-as-energy-prices-soar-russa-ukraine-war
3/16/2022,"Myanmar’s military junta has committed widespread and systematic abuses against civilians that may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the first comprehensive report to be produced by the UN’s human rights office since last year’s coup. The UN rights office warns the military has shown “flagrant disregard for human life” and has deliberately targeted civilians since it seized power on 1 February 2021. The report details numerous atrocities by the military, including the bombardment of populated areas with airstrikes and heavy weapons, and a series of mass killings of civilians. It cites cases where civilians have been shot in the head, burned to death, arbitrarily arrested, tortured or used as human shields. “The appalling breadth and scale of violations of international law suffered by the people of Myanmar demand a firm, unified, and resolute international response,” said Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for Human Rights. Many western countries have imposed sanctions on members of the military and military-owned businesses, while the Association of South-east Asian Nations has led attempts at negotiations, though with virtually no progress. At least 1,600 people have been killed by security forces in Myanmar since the coup, according to the UN, which says airstrikes, helicopter gunships, artillery, and mortars are being used indiscriminately in populated areas. The report also refers to series of massacres by the security forces, including the killing of up to 40 women, men, and children in Kayah State in December. Those who discovered the victims’ remains said some bodies were in positions that suggested they had tried to escape and had been burned alive, according to the UN. The military junta, which is widely opposed by the people, has imposed brutal violence and repression in an attempt to maintain control of the country. Despite this, the public remains defiant in its refusal to accept military rule. Alongside a peaceful protest movement, many civilians – from poets and farmers, to IT workers and students – have taken up arms in response to military atrocities. Raids on the homes of anyone suspected of dissent “occur with unrelenting regularity”, according to the report. At least 12,500 have been detained over the past year, with “hundreds if not thousands having been subjected to torture”. About 325 people, including 16 children, have been killed in detention. The report is based on interviews with more than 155 victims, witnesses, and advocates, as well as satellite imagery and video footage. The junta has previously accused the UN of bias and seeking to interfere in its domestic affairs, and has rejected past death toll estimates cited by officials. It has also accused the UN of downplaying violence by anti-coup groups. The UN report said at least 543 people have been killed due to their perceived support for the military, but that the majority of human rights abuses it had documented were carried out by security forces. Bachelet said the public was defiant in its demand for an end to military rule. “Throughout the tumult and violence of the past year … they remain committed to seeing a return to democracy and to institutions that reflect their will and aspirations,” she said. “Meaningful action by the international community is urgently needed to stop yet more individuals from being stripped of their rights, their lives and their livelihoods,” said Bachelet.",News/World news,"Widespread abuses since Myanmar coup may amount to war crimes, says UN report",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/widespread-abuses-since-myanmar-coup-may-amount-to-war-crimes-says-un-report
3/16/2022,"Two years ago, accepting the first best picture Oscar for a foreign-language film, for Parasite, Bong Joon-ho said: “Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.” If Ryūsuke Hamaguchi’s Drive My Car – definitely amazing – becomes the second foreign-language victor, that means Oscar voters will have vaulted multiple barriers: not just the film’s own English subtitles, but the various Japanese, Mandarin, Korean and Korean sign language ones its main character, widowed theatre director Yûsuke, uses in his experimental multilingual stage productions. Through the course of this year’s awards season, Drive My Car has had a gear surge out of the foreign-language category to enter the bigger conversation – despite a foreboding three-hour runtime, a resolutely high-minded tone and the kind of unhurried pace that permits it to drop the opening credits 40 minutes in. But its embrace is the broadest. Not just its polyglot setup, but the canonical plays Yûsuke stars in and stages – Waiting for Godot and Uncle Vanya – show Hamaguchi’s aspiration to the universal, and dealing in the biggest themes: sexuality as a creative force, the enigma of others, grief, the capacity of storytelling and acting to transmute trauma. Maybe Drive My Car’s biggest achievement – where there is air between it and other heavyweight nominees such as The Power of the Dog and Belfast is how effortlessly it accomplishes all this. Yûsuke hasn’t just lost his wife, he’s discovered she had been having an affair with callow pin-up actor Kôji; a double, amorous and creative betrayal. He returns to work directing Vanya, trying to lull his multinational cast into catching the inner meaning of their lines. Just as, chauffeured to work in a red Saab by the taciturn Misaki and listening in the back seat to his dead wife recite the same lines on cassette, Yûsuke is lulled into opening up about the past. It sounds heavy, but – the film’s various lanes smoothly running in parallel – the sensation is almost soothing. There’s an almost comic overlay to Hidetoshi Nishijima’s marvellously withheld performance as Yûsuke; the eternal passenger, stiff and blinking with passivity, dodging having his conscience caught by refusing to take the role of the disillusioned Vanya himself. That kind of lightly worn profundity doesn’t come easy. Yûsuke drills his actors by engaging them in mind-numbing line readings, all the better to internalise the words’ meaning. These are apparently Hamaguchi’s own methods. And he as director has done the same thing to hit a sweet pitch in Drive My Car: worked through coarser iterations of these ideas about identity and acting, right from his 2008 graduation project, Passion, to 2018’s Asako I & II. Parasite’s win in 2020 only confirmed an open secret for cinephiles: Bong’s genius, of which his film was just a culmination. But if Drive My Car won best picture, it would be a true surprise from an emerging auteur, exemplifying all the thrill of discovery that foreign-language cinema is all about. Near the end of Drive My Car, face masks start unobtrusively appearing in scenes. Initially, I thought it had been filmed BC (before Covid), and they were an Asian thing. In fact, Hamaguchi shot in part during the pandemic, and, given their absence elsewhere, the masks appear to be an unspoken reference. And indeed, this powerful work is the perfect post-pandemic best picture winner, emerging from introspection and trauma with a calm realisation. It steps over Twitter-false dichotomies about blockbusters v arthouse with a total sense of absorption in its own purpose. In times like these, it’s art that keeps the motor running.",Arts/Film,Why Drive My Car should win the best picture Oscar,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/mar/16/why-drive-my-car-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar
3/16/2022,"Liz Truss has accused Russia of “playing a smoke and mirrors game” by pretending to seek peace despite launching an “appalling war” in Ukraine, as Boris Johnson dampened down suggestions that Ukraine could join Nato. As the conflict neared the end of its third week, Britain’s foreign secretary called it a “serious threat to the global order” and suggested the Kremlin could extend its attention to other eastern European countries in an attempt to “recreate the Soviet Union”. The overnight assessment by the UK’s Military of Defence said Russian troops were “struggling to overcome the challenges posed by Ukraine’s terrain” and were confined mostly to the road network. It said Russia’s “continued failure to gain control of the air has drastically limited their ability to effectively use air manoeuvre, further limiting their options.” Truss suggested the prospect of successful peace talks was still some way off, given that the first precursor would be a ceasefire and Vladimir Putin withdrawing soldiers. “It’s very, very difficult for the Ukrainians to negotiate with a gun against their heads,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “I am very, very concerned that Putin is playing a smoke-and-mirrors game of trying to claim that he is seeking peace whilst at the same time continuing with this appalling war that he instigated. And he’s not making the progress that he thought he would.” Truss said talk of whether Ukraine could join the western defensive military alliance of Nato was “not the real issue”. Her comments came in stark contrast to Boris Johnson, who said on Wednesday morning there was “no way Ukraine is going to join Nato anytime soon”. The prime minister said he understood “the reality of the position”, speaking during a visit to the Middle East with significant restrictions on access to journalists during which he will push for help to wean the UK and wider west off Russian energy. It followed the admission by Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, about the chance of the country becoming a Nato member. “We will not enter there, and these are truths and must be acknowledged,” he said. The comment was viewed as a crucial concession that could pave the way to a de-escalation of the war. Truss, meanwhile, said: “It’s a matter for Ukraine whether or not they decide to join Nato and of course, a matter for Nato members. I’ve always thought that that isn’t the real issue, that it is a smokescreen. “And if you look at all of Putin’s public statements, his Munich security conference speech in 2007, his essay of last year, this is about recreating a greater Russia, and essentially subordinating Ukraine under Russian authority, as well as extending more broadly to other eastern European states. “This is why it’s so important that we stop Putin in Ukraine, because it isn’t just about Ukraine. It isn’t just about Nato. It is about the desire to recreate the Soviet Union, and he is clearly an extremely dangerous man.” Pressed on whether it was more important for the UK to sacrifice its moral opposition to the death penalty by seeking the Saudi government’s help after the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and recent executions of 81 men, Truss said: “I’m not condoning every action by the Saudi government. “We need to be prepared to work with countries we don’t necessarily agree with because this is a threat to global security in a way that no other country poses that level of threat.” She added: “This is a serious threat to the global order. It’s an incredibly serious threat to European security. And we cannot afford to simply rule out countries because we don’t like a particular policy.”",News/World news,"Russia playing ‘smoke and mirrors game’, says Liz Truss",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/16/russia-playing-smoke-and-mirrors-game-says-liz-truss
3/16/2022,"The New South Wales government has confirmed it will not support One Nation MP Mark Latham’s controversial bill to ban discussion of gender diversity in classrooms, saying it could cause “targeted discrimination” against trans students. First put forward in 2020, Latham’s “Parental Rights” bill sought to prohibit teachers from discussing “the ideology of gender fluidity to children in schools” and prevent schools from supporting transgender students without parental consent. In September, a parliamentary inquiry into the bill that was chaired by Latham recommended more far-reaching prohibitions be included in departmental policies on trans students in schools. The changes would have prohibited students from confidentially coming out as trans to their teachers, banned trans students from playing school sports aligning with their gender from high school, required trans students to undergo a full medical transition to use toilets aligning with their gender, and required parental consent before any discussion of matters concerning gender or sexuality. Despite support from some religious groups, advocates slammed the committee’s recommendations as a “direct attack on the safety of trans and gender diverse young people in schools” as well as potentially “unlawful”. The committee’s recommendations were opposed by the Greens MP David Shoebridge and Labor’s Anthony D’Adam, but endorsed by some other MPs including the government MP Scott Farlow and Labor’s Courtney Houssos. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The NSW education minister, Sarah Mitchell, released the government’s response to the bill on Wednesday evening, shooting down any prospect of the government’s support for its recommendations. In her response to the inquiry into the bill, Mitchell said the government would not support its recommendations in part because it “may lead to targeted discrimination against a marginalised community which already experiences poorer mental health and wellbeing outcomes”. “Seventy-two per cent of gender diverse young people have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder,” she wrote in her response. “Forty-eight per cent of gender diverse young people have attempted suicide in their lifetime. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) young people are five times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers.

The government’s response to the bill also shot down individual recommendations on changes to departmental policy, including bans on school counsellors discussing “gender fluidity and transition without prior reference to parents”. “Placing restrictions on school counsellors in this manner is complex and would be in conflict with the obligations of counsellors arising from the requirements of their professional organisations and legal requirements,” the response stated. On the proposal to ban students playing sport outside of their biological gender from Year 7, the government’s response stated that it was up to schools to “manage these issues on a case by case basis”. And on banning students using bathrooms aligning with their gender without a full medical transition Mitchell wrote: “Decisions about suitable toilet arrangements and accommodation for all students are made based on what is reasonably required to protect students from foreseeable risk of harm”. The decision to reject the bill was welcomed both by advocates and the NSW education union. Shoebridge called the government’s rejection of the bill a “testament to the many brave witnesses and experts who stood up against this hateful proposal”. “While the outcome is a huge relief we must not ignore the damage done by the debate and the fear generated by the prospect of these laws being passed,” he said. “We need politics to be better than this and to unambiguously support the rights and safety of the LGBTIQ community at all times.” In a statement, Ghassan Kassisieh, the legal director of Equality Australia, said “the LGBTIQ+ community in NSW will breathe a little easier today”. “The NSW government has stood up to One Nation’s bullying of trans and gender diverse kids, affirming their right to connect, succeed and thrive at school,” he said. “The government’s response not only rejects One Nation’s Bill in full, but also rejects these recommendations, concluding that they would contradict existing legal obligations and policies, impinge on the rights of students, and states that existing policies deal sufficiently with relevant issues on a case-by-case basis.” The NSW Teachers Federation president, Angelo Gavrielatos, also welcomed the decision to reject the bill, saying it would have “pit parents against schools and teachers, and fail to put students first”. “The education that parents expect from the school system is one that prepares young people to be active citizens of the world,” he said. “We’re pleased the government has rejected One Nation’s bill which sought to stop teachers from exploring contemporary topics and for students to be able to critically analyse and evaluate information available to them in order to develop an informed opinion on a topic.”",News/Australia news,‘Targeted discrimination’: NSW government rejects Mark Latham’s trans bill,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/16/targeted-discrimination-nsw-government-rejects-mark-lathams-trans-bill
3/16/2022,"At least 18 private jets or helicopters linked to Russia have been struck from the Isle of Man’s aircraft register, as the offshore authorities enforce sanctions brought in by the EU and UK. Three aircraft have been removed in the last week, including a helicopter and private jets believed to be ultimately owned by Roman Abramovich, Oleg Tinkov – an oligarch not subject to direct sanctions – and Dmitry Mazepin. The cancellations ensure that the aircraft cannot be flown in UK or EU airspace, even though they are not directly owned or registered by individuals sanctioned for their connections to Russia. A spokesperson for the Isle of Man government said that aircraft with a connection to Russia were being “reviewed as a matter of utmost priority”. He said that the Isle of Man aircraft registry – favoured by the super-rich to avoid taxes liable elsewhere – had acted “proactively and robustly” since the imposition of sanctions, working in cooperation with the UK’s Department for Transport. He said the registry, known as Iomar, was “duty bound to act appropriately in accordance with such measures, and under these circumstances an aircraft would be de-registered following required legal and regulatory processes”. Iomar has so far cancelled the registration of 18 aircraft and said it was likely that further deregistrations may follow in a “rapidly evolving situation”. Among the latest were an Airbus helicopter which has previously been tracked landing on the Chelsea owner Abramovich’s Solaris yacht, and a Gulfstream G650 aircraft owned by Mazepin. Mazepin, a billionaire owner of mineral fertiliser company Uralchem, was added to the EU sanctions list last week, along with his son, the ex-F1 driver Nikita Mazepin. Mazepin Sr was described in the sanctions document as “a member of the closest circle of Vladimir Putin”. A Dassault Falcon business jet linked to Oleg Tinkov, the founder of Russian online bank Tinkoff, has also been deregistered. Tinkov is not sanctioned, but his wealth is estimated by Forbes to have fallen more than $5bn in a month as the rouble has collapsed since the invasion. Russian-owned and operated planes have been banned from UK airspace. Last week a private plane with suspected links to the country was impounded at Farnborough airport on the orders of the transport secretary, Grant Shapps.",News/World news,Isle of Man deregisters 18 Russian private jets and helicopters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/15/isle-of-man-authorities-deregister-russian-linked-private-aircraft
