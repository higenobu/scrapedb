1/29/2022,"Activists handing out “Where is Peng Shuai” T-shirts at the Australian Open say they will take their campaign to other grand slams and not cease until they are satisfied of the Chinese tennis player’s safety. Seven days after a video went viral of two activists being forced to remove their T-Shirts by Melbourne Park security, the group made good on their promise to print 1,000 shirts they hoped spectators would wear inside Rod Laver Arena during the women’s singles final.  About 20 people were voluntarily stationed at each entrance, where they also distributed ribbons and stickers saying “Missing!” in Mandarin. A few shirts could be seen dotted throughout the 80% capacity crowd during the match, with many more sporting the yellow ribbons. “I’m just happy that people care about Peng Shuai,” said Brisbane activist Drew Pavlou, who has been driving the movement alongside Max Mok, a pro-democracy campaigner from Hong Kong. “We’ve been posting on Twitter for six months and nothing ever really happens. Suddenly everyone is covering it, so I’m really happy about that.” A few days after the shirts were banned and a banner was confiscated, and following an international backlash, Tennis Australia reversed its decision to prohibit them based on their claim they constituted “commercial or political” material. “Tennis Australia never reached out to me or any of my team members, they just put out statements via the media,” Mok said. “We’ve just been trying to keep them honest. We will take this to the French Open, Wimbledon, the US Open. We will not stop.” Mok said the sentiment at the gates had been one of mostly support. Another activist said Peter Costello, the chairman of Nine Entertainment Corporation which owns the tournament’s host broadcaster the Nine Network, declined to take a T-shirt when he entered but told them he supported their cause. Pavlou, who was this week blocked on Twitter by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, said some of the volunteers were strangers who had approached him on social media and asked him how they could help. Overall the group had raised more than $21,000, with which they had 1,000 T-shirts printed and thousands more ribbons made. They had hoped to spend the remaining $5,000 on hiring a plane to fly a “Where is Peng Shuai?” banner over Melbourne Park on Saturday afternoon before the match, however every company they approached declined to be involved. Pavlou said the remaining money will likely be donated to a sexual violence prevention charity. Peng has appeared only rarely on Chinese social media since early November when her post on Weibo, in which she accused the former vice-premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault, was quickly deleted from China’s heavily censored internet. In late December, Peng retracted her allegations in an interview with Singapore media outlet Lianhe Zaobao, a Chinese-language publication under the state-controlled Singapore Press Holdings Limited.",Sport/Sport,‘We will not stop’: ‘Where is Peng Shuai’ T-shirts appear at Australian Open final,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/29/we-will-not-stop-where-is-peng-shuai-t-shirts-appear-at-australian-open-final
1/29/2022,"Headteachers John Barnes and Andrew O’Neill have both a lot and little in common. Both are successful leaders grappling with the impact of the pandemic as well as the usual challenges facing 21st-century schools. But Barnes leads a small trust, the Seaton Valley Federation, in the heart of Blyth Valley, Northumberland, one of the most marginal “red wall” seats in the country, at a time when the government is under huge pressure to explain what its levelling up agenda means for longstanding Labour constituencies that switched to the Conservatives in 2019.  O’Neill, meanwhile, is the head of an inner-city London secondary in an area of high deprivation at the heart of one of the wealthiest boroughs in the country. All Saints Catholic college in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea has almost double the national average of pupils eligible for free school meals. It is within walking distance of Grenfell Tower and some of the most expensive homes in Britain. The Kensington parliamentary constituency also could be described as the most marginal “blue wall” seat in England, with a parliamentary majority of just 150, having been held by the Tories for most of the last 50 years. But two years after the election that delivered Boris Johnson an 80-seat majority on the back of a promise to equalise opportunities across the UK, both heads are unclear what levelling up means for their schools. A white paper, now expected in February, has been repeatedly delayed amid rumours that the Treasury will not provide adequate funding to meet the expectations of voters who handed Boris Johnson victory. Meanwhile, school funding has taken a hit over the past decade. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the 9% real-terms cut in spending per pupil puts a “major brake on levelling up”. Reforms to the way money is distributed to schools, intended to make the system fairer, have been exposed for disproportionately benefiting schools with lower disadvantage. Even without the pandemic learning loss, it would take 500 years, at current rates, to close the GCSE attainment gap between children from different backgrounds. Yet there has only been one levelling up policy for schools – a premium for maths and science teachers – and that is yet to be implemented. “Levelling up is a lovely soundbite,” says Barnes. “But where is the detail for education and more generally? I have never met a headteacher who doesn’t want their children to do the very best and I have never had a politician come and sit in my office and ask me what we need. “Our schools are not particularly disadvantaged, and I would agree that free school meals are a good proxy for deprivation, but we have a lot of ‘just about managing’ families. They get excluded from extra funding and there needs to be a better conversation about those people. They need to see jobs and cultural opportunities in their communities, good mental health support and they need to see someone cares about them. “Above all, if we want to level up, we need honesty about one thing. We need to fund state schools at the same level as private schools. I am not against private schools but their termly fees are the equivalent of my annual per pupil funding. This is unfair.” At the other end of the country, O’Neill acknowledges there is resentment about London schools, which receive more per-pupil funding than schools elsewhere in the country and get better results than some areas that have been branded “left behind”. In the past year he has been developing a website, Lighthouse, that crunches government data about schools, their funding, their results and local contexts including income deprivation affecting children index (IDACI) data. “This is a very complex issue,” he says. “It certainly isn’t going to be resolved by a political project that pushes funds into certain areas to try and win votes. A few more vanity capital projects in the north are not going to make significant change. “One of the reasons I set up the website was because the government puts data in lots of different places and I wanted to see it together to be able to find schools like my own so that I could make comparisons, as well as potentially making contact to see how we could improve. “There are areas of deep deprivation within many local authority areas. Parts of Kensington are more deprived than parts of Blyth Valley but is it all about the money? Probably not. We are a school in IDACI decile one, with 50% of pupils eligible for the pupil premium, yet our children see wealth and opportunity on the doorsteps. “We have a music teacher who teaches choral works in Latin. London schools probably have access to a more mobile pool of high-performing, well-educated members of staff. Unless we define what we mean by levelling up, how can we judge success? Is it income, is it opportunities, is it pupil outcomes? “We need a deeper understanding of the issues to make the changes that will benefit all young people. For too long education has been beholden to politicians offering neat soundbites that tinker at the edges but don’t produce the scale of transformation needed to provide high-quality education across the whole of the country.” One aspect of the levelling up agenda that fascinates O’Neill is the plight of the safe Conservative seats in which students appear to do less well than some of the much trailed “red wall” areas. Dan Morrow leads the Dartmoor Multi Academy Trust in Torridge and West Devon, where the former attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, whose lucrative overseas legal practice abroad was recently exposed, has a 25,000 majority. Morrow feels strongly that political expediency may obscure the need for more investment in areas such as his. “Trying to level up areas such as the former ‘red wall’ means that traditionally Conservative areas may be overlooked, despite the clear case for increased support,” he says. “I appreciate that there are post-industrial towns and cities that need investment. I’ve worked in schools in deprived areas across the country. But rural poverty remains a major issue and the same underlying problems exist here; huge disparities between rich and poor, lack of affordable housing and job opportunities, outdated transport links, which make opportunities harder for younger people, and the sense of isolation that then comes from rural disadvantage. “Just because this is taking place in a constituency that also has wealthy semi-aristocratic landowners and stunning scenery, doesn’t make it less of a pronounced issue for young people. If the government want to take levelling up seriously – and make it clear it isn’t just being pursued for political gain – then they must bring more of a focus to rural poverty.” Morrow would like to see closer integration of health, social care and education for young people. “Essentially the disparity in thresholds and provision exacerbates inequalities, and circumstances of birth remain too anchored to a sense of inevitable destiny,” he says. Anita Bath, the chief executive of the Bishop Bewick Catholic Education Trust, has oversight of schools in three local authorities across north-east England, including rural, inner-city Labour and now Conservative areas. She is also adamant that political boundaries should be irrelevant. “More money is always very welcome as it brings freedom, but there are structural issues that need to be rethought rather than sticking plasters. Where are the big thinkers in education?” she says. “We know that by the time children get to primary school they can be 18 months behind their peers. We need to rethink the whole primary sector and narrow the gap at that point.” A recent poll suggested that if there were a general election now, the Tories would lose all but three of their “red wall” seats, so the challenge facing ministers is intense. An education white paper, the first since 2016, has also been promised this year, but Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which has produced its own blueprint for change, believes there is a range of pressing issues. “Children with special educational needs clearly need more support. Post-16 education has been treated by the government as the poor relation with the largest falls in funding of any sector of the education system over the past decade,” he says. “And schools in England require £11.4bn of repairs, according to the Department for Education’s own figures. “You can’t level up without tackling these problems. Then there’s the long-running and intractable issue of a big gap in academic attainment between disadvantaged youngsters and other children, and the fact that, in normal times, about one-third of pupils leave secondary education with less than a grade 4 in GCSE English and maths.” He adds: “If levelling up means anything, we have to do better for these young people. Having sufficient funding is a significant factor, but there are others too. Curriculum and qualifications aren’t working for them. “If the government gets this right, with clarity and ambition, it could be a seminal moment. What it cannot be is more of the same.”  Additional data used for this article can be found here.",News/Education,‘Fund state schools at the level of private ones’: what sort of levelling up do headteachers want?,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/29/levelling-up-schools-headteachers
1/29/2022,"When Lois van Baarle, a Dutch artist, scoured the biggest NFT marketplace for her name late last year, she found more than 100 pieces of her art for sale. None of them had been put up by her. Van Baarle is a popular digital artist, with millions of followers on social media. She’s one of a growing number of artists who have had online images of their art stolen, minted as unique digital assets on a blockchain, and offered up to trade in cryptocurrency on the NFT platform OpenSea.  The rise in such thefts comes as the market for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, exploded last year, growing to an estimated $22bn, attracting Sotheby’s and Christie’s, and driving multimillion-dollar auctions for these new certificates of ownership of digital assets. OpenSea has grown at a dizzying pace, and is now valued at $13bn. But amid its spectacular rise, the company is doing far too little to prevent the trade in fraudulent NFTs, some artists charge, and is placing much of the burden of policing art fraud on the artists themselves. OpenSea said in a statement: “It is against our policy to sell NFTs using plagiarized content,” adding that it regularly delisted and banned accounts that did so. The company said it was working to build new image recognition and other tools that would quickly recognize stolen content and protect creators, and that it planned to launch some of them in the first half of this year. In theory, blockchain technology was supposed to make it easier for digital artists to sell unique tokens of ownership, offering buyers a permanent record of ownership linked to the work. For some artists, the technology opened up a new way to earn money : Kenny Schachter, a New York-based video artist and art writer, embraced NFTs early and said he has made hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past year, after three decades working within an art world in which video art rarely sold. “We’re in an incredible mushrooming of opportunity for digital artists,” said Schachter. “It’s 1,000% better than a year ago, two years ago, when there was no marketplace for any of this art.” But other artists say that the past year’s crypto boom has been a nightmare. Among the problems is that anyone can “mint” a digital file as an NFT, whether or not they have rights to it in the first place, and the process is anonymous by default. “It is much easier to make forgeries in the blockchain space than in the traditional art world. It’s as simple as right-click, save,” said Tina Rivers Ryan, a curator and expert in digital art at the Albright-Knox gallery in Buffalo, New York. “It’s also harder to fight forgers. How do you sue the anonymous holder of a crypto wallet? In which jurisdiction?” DeviantArt, a decades-old online community for digital artists that hosts half a billion pieces of digital art, began monitoring the blockchain for copies of their users’ work last fall after NFTs based on stolen work by Qing Han, a beloved artist who died in 2020 after publicly chronicling her struggle with cancer, were found for sale on OpenSea. DeviantArt has sent 90,000 alerts about possible fraud to thousands of their users since then, company executives said. It’s now scanning for fraud across 4m newly minted NFTs each week. The number of alerts doubled from October to November, and grew by 300% from November to mid-December. In December, bots began attacking the site, Moti Levy, DeviantArt’s chief operations officer said, scraping whole galleries of artists’ works. The pieces would later appear on NFT marketplaces, often with artists’ names and watermarks still attached. The attacks have focused on DeviantArt’s most popular artists, measured by likes and comments, Levy said, rather than any particular aesthetic. “Bots are bots,” he said. Aja Trier, a Texas-based artist who has found viral fame for painting riffs on Van Gogh’s Starry Night featuring various breeds of dog, said she discovered 87,000 NFTs based on images of her work for sale on OpenSea, many of them priced at $9.88 each. Trier said 500 listings of her stolen work were added in a single night, suggesting the theft was being automated and carried out by bots. The recourse she has as the legitimate creator of the work, she said, is to write individual copyright infringement takedown requests to OpenSea and to manually monitor for new fraudulent listings – all time-consuming work. The most effective way to get the company to take down their stolen work, Trier and several other artists said, has been by tweeting angrily about the problem or talking to media outlets. At least 37 NFTs made based on Trier’s stolen work were bought before OpenSea took down the fraudulent listings, Trier said, and she has not seen any of that money come back to her, even though OpenSea makes a 2.5% commission on each sale. “It seems to me that they’re making some money on illicit behavior,” Trier said. “They have a $13bn valuation and they’re trying to go public. How much of their valuation is from stolen art?” ​​ The kind of fraud artists were complaining about made up only a small fraction of its transactions, OpenSea said. It took enforcement action on 3,500 collections of NFTs every week for counterfeit or copyright reasons, it said, which represents 0.175% of the platform’s more than 2m total collections. It said the site now lists more than 80m individual NFTs. But the problem of plagiarism, whatever its scale, was an important one, the company acknowledged: “We are constantly evaluating new ways to do our part.” The current reporting process for artists whose stolen work is turned into NFTs is confusing and laborious, confirmed Ashli Weiss, a Silicon Valley lawyer who specializes in intellectual property and works with blockchain companies, adding that there is currently little incentive for OpenSea and other marketplaces to fix the problem. “OpenSea is getting paid with each transaction.” OpenSea disputed the view that it did not have an incentive to tackle art theft and plagiarism: “For more people to join OpenSea or other Web3 communities, these issues must be addressed head-on,” a spokesperson said. More than half of the company’s current staff works either full-time or extensively on issues of plagiarism and content moderation, OpenSea said, and it is developing “smart moderation” tools to speed up the company’s response to reports of plagiarism. But the company also defended some of the policies that artists would like to change as essential to its mission. While some artists would like to see a crackdown on bots, creating hundreds or thousands of NFTs at one time is normal for the space, OpenSea said, noting that there are 10,000 “Bored Apes” and more than 8,000 “Pudgy Penguins”, two of the most prominent and commercially successful NFT collections.  Van Baarle, the Dutch digital artist, said that she has seen OpenSea’s process for reporting art fraud improve somewhat over the past year. In the early months of trying to flag her stolen art on the platform the site had a “report” button that never generated any response to her at all. By late December, she said, it had introduced a reporting form that made it substantially easier to log the fraud, and each attempt at least generated an email response. But the company can still do more to verify an NFT’s legitimacy before the token is offered up for sale, she said, rather than having artists play whack-a-mole with an endless sequence of anonymous grifters. “For a concept that is supposedly about authenticity, to me it looks like the opposite,” Van Baarle said. “From where I’m standing, it looks like one huge mess of theft and fraud and inauthenticity.”",News/Technology,‘Huge mess of theft and fraud:’ artists sound alarm as NFT crime proliferates,https://www.theguardian.com/global/2022/jan/29/huge-mess-of-theft-artists-sound-alarm-theft-nfts-proliferates
1/29/2022,"The former university access tsar has said the government’s reported proposals to bar entry to students with lower school grades are “crude” and “regressive”. He believes ministers are poised to go ahead with reducing the number of degree places for young people. Chris Millward finished his four-year term as the first director for fair access and participation at the government’s Office for Students before Christmas and is now a professor at the University of Birmingham. He says limiting the number of university students just as the number of 18-year-olds in the population is rising would be socially divisive.  “For 20 years, governments of all parties have broadly supported the growth of higher education [HE] participation, but the rhetoric is now very different. The government is saying that it wants more people to go into FE [further education] and work, rather than HE.” Millward says if the government goes ahead with cutting access to university, it should expect considerable resistance from parents and young people, who see getting a degree as the best way of improving their life chances. Record numbers of students started university during the pandemic, and universities say they have received high numbers of applications again for the coming academic year. “The question is: is any minister really willing to stand up when A-level results come out and say ‘sorry, there isn’t room for you to go to university’?” He argues that the government cannot “crudely cap the HE side of the equation and expect that to change demand” but must improve alternative options for students in further education first, as well as making sure they can move on to university afterwards if they want to. “If you don’t do that, it’s going to be very divisive,” he said. This warning on future plans, coming from someone who has been at the heart of the government machine, has been received with gloom by universities. The government has never publicly said it intends to cut student numbers, despite ministers attacking Tony Blair’s “absurd mantra” that half of all young people should go to university. Millward’s intervention is the strongest hint so far that the proposals are a serious prospect. This month Millward wrote about his lessons from the OfS role in a paper for the Centre for Global Higher Education, based at Oxford University. He said reducing access to degrees would be “a bad outcome for all of us working in higher education”. Insiders say ministers know that announcing a formal cap on student numbers could alienate voters and they are much more likely to squeeze the sector “by the back door”. The government is widely expected to announce plans for a new minimum entry threshold to study at university, using GCSE or A-level grades to restrict access to student loans, with the aim of pushing those who no longer qualify into further education colleges instead. Millward is adamant that this will unfairly shut doors for the poorest young people. “You shouldn’t stop certain students accessing student loans because that penalises the individual in a pretty crude, regressive way,” he said. “We all know there is a strong correlation between your social background and your school grades and that has only become stronger during the pandemic.” University chiefs think it is most likely that in future loans will only be given to students who have at least a level 4 (the equivalent of an old grade C) in maths and English at GCSE. An analysis of Department for Education (DfE) GCSE results data conducted by the Million Plus group of modern universities before Christmas showed that under this plan 48% of all disadvantaged students in England would be ineligible for a student loan. The proposal to limit loans is thought to be driven by the Treasury. Financial pressure has been ratcheted up by the prime minister’s flagship Lifelong Learning Entitlement – a new entitlement to take out loans for four years of flexible higher learning including short courses from 2025 –which is expected to make unpaid student loan debt mushroom even further. University vice-chancellors and social mobility experts are deeply concerned about the prospect. Lee Elliot Major, a professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, said: “Reducing numbers of degree places tends to hit poorer students disproportionately.” He said that while it was “absolutely right” to improve opportunities for young people who do not go to university, “that should not be at the expense of the hard won successes in enrolling greater numbers of poorer pupils into higher education”. Alistair Jarvis, the chief executive of the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, said: “Reducing the number of students going into HE would cause real damage. The future economy is likely to be highly skilled, so cutting numbers when we need more highly skilled people and not fewer doesn’t make sense. People want their children and grandchildren to go to university. I don’t see any signs that they are reconsidering that. It is a life-changing experience.” Prof Dave Phoenix, the vice-chancellor of London South Bank University and a former chair of the Million Plus group of modern universities, said: “If we want a knowledge-based economy, all the evidence suggests we need more people qualified to degree level not fewer.” A senior higher-education figure close to the government, who asked not to be named, said the Treasury believed it would only be feasible to add the prime minister’s new “lifelong” loans on to the existing student loan debt if the DfE offered fewer loans to 18-year-olds “to compensate”. But he added: “None of the options are easy and all of them are extremely contentious.” A cut to tuition fees, mooted last year as one option, is now thought less likely. Ministers are also expected to change the terms of repayments. In a surprise announcement on Friday they scrapped plans to raise the repayment threshold by 4.6%. Universities have been braced for the government’s response to the Augar review of post-18 education – which reported in 2019 – for months. Jarvis said: “After two years of uncertainty with the pandemic, there is a real frustration amongst vice-chancellors that they don’t know what is coming.” A spokesperson for the DfE said no decisions had yet been made about minimum grade requirements. “This is a government that has boosted aspirations and grown opportunities for disadvantaged people across the country, and last year a record proportion of disadvantaged students have started university as a result,” he said. “We are committed to continuing to level up opportunity so every young person can fulfil their potential.”",News/Education,"UK government wants to reduce university places for poorest, says tsar",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/jan/29/government-university-places-poorest-chris-millward
