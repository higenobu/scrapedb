1/25/2022,"A sexual assault survivor who sparked a national conversation about the treatment of women and sexual assault in Australia has found herself at the centre of another fiery debate over expectations on women to smile in public. Grace Tame won last year’s Australian of the year prize after her advocacy was instrumental in overturning a Tasmanian law preventing survivors from speaking publicly about their assault.  She later said that in the minutes after delivering her impassioned acceptance speech, Australia’s prime minister, Scott Morrison, leaned over to her and whispered: “Gee, I bet it felt good to get that out.” The revelation forced Morrison to defend himself, telling parliament he did not mean it to sound patronising. “That was a very brave statement, that is exactly what I meant when I said that to her on that occasion,” he said. On Tuesday morning the 27-year-old met Morrison and his wife, Jenny, as she arrived at a get-together for the 2022 Australian of the year finalists in Canberra. The Morrisons grinned broadly for media while Tame and her fiance, Max Heerey, appeared impassive. The photo opportunity quickly went viral on social media, where Tame drew praise from high-profile women and condemnation from the Murdoch media and some conservative senators. As she is undoubtedly vilified following the encounter, remember this.Grace Tame owes the PM nothing.Not her smile, not her handshake, not her civility. And definitely not her respect. The political commentator Peter Van Onselen wrote in The Australian that Tame had been “ungracious, rude and childish”. “If your disdain for the man is so great [understandable perhaps] that you can’t even muster basic and common courtesy, then just don’t go,” he wrote. “But acting like a child displaying a lack of basic manners when coming face-to-face with him in a meet and greet was unbecoming and unnecessary. To look as forlorn as she did in response, rudely and deliberately looking away from the photographer, was an act of juvenile dissent.” Many women on social media defended Tame. The author and activist Sally Rugg said every man scolding Tame for not smiling enough was “telling on themselves”. “We see you,” she wrote on Twitter. “Women do not have to smile for the camera beside men we do not like.” For those surprised by Grace Tame’s cold reception to the PM, I ask: were you living under a rock last year? There was a female-led insurgency against the government unlike anything Australia has ever seen - and you’re getting vapours over a side-eye? To those criticising Grace Tame for not posing for a happy snap with a man in charge of an office which actively engages in undermining survivors: get in the bin. If you’re uncomfortable because a woman won’t smile and support the status quo, maybe you’re part of the problem. Several politicians from Morrison’s centre-right Liberal party joined Van Onselen in denouncing Tame. The New South Wales senator Hollie Hughes labelled her “immature” and Queensland senator James McGrath called her behaviour “childish”. “It is a pity her behaviour and attacks on our prime minister are so partisan, political and childish,” he wrote on Facebook. “If she didn’t like being Australian of the year she should hand back the honour.” Woman Faces Backlash For Not Pretending Everything Is Okay: https://t.co/rPgClCvqop pic.twitter.com/hTUaIaAnqC Tame has also used her platform to criticise the government’s handling of rape allegations within Parliament House made by former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins, which are now the subject of criminal proceedings. Very telling in who is criticising Grace Tame for reacting with her authentic feelings. We’re all very conditioned to seeing women smile, even when we know it’s fake, to keep the peace. It’s refreshing to see a woman not do the polite thing to make others feel better In an address in March, Tame was asked what she thought of the prime minister’s handling of the issue after Morrison said he spoke to his wife, who helped him understand the seriousness of the allegations. “Jenny and I spoke last night and she said to me: ‘You have to think about this as a father. What would you want to happen if it were our girls?’” Morrison had said. “Jenny has a way of clarifying things. Always has. And so, I’ve reflected on that overnight and listened to Brittany and what she had to say.” Tame said it shouldn’t take anyone to have children to have a conscience. “And actually, on top of that, having children doesn’t guarantee a conscience,” she said at the time.",News/Australia news,Photo of stony-faced campaigner with PM divides Australia,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/jan/25/photo-of-stony-faced-campaigner-with-pm-divides-australia
1/25/2022,"Royal Mail plans to cut 700 management jobs and lowered its profit outlook after a tough Christmas when deliveries were disrupted by high sickness levels caused by the spread of Omicron. The company said it had started consulting unions on the cuts, which were designed to “streamline operational management to improve focus on performance at a local level”. It has frequently been at loggerheads with unions over changes, and stressed that the cuts would be made “through natural turnover, redeployment and voluntary redundancy, wherever possible”.  Royal Mail employs 140,000 people, and the 700 management cuts are out of a total of 8,000 managers. The job cuts will save £40m a year, but result in a one-off charge of £70m. This means Royal Mail’s full-year adjusted operating profit will miss its previous £500m estimate and come in at £430m. The latest job losses come on top of 2,000 reductions outlined in June 2020 – one in five management roles – in areas including IT, finance, marketing and sales. Russ Mould, the investment director at the stockbroker AJ Bell, said: “In streamlining the business, Royal Mail needs to ensure it doesn’t go too far and diminish its operational capability or spark widespread industrial action, the threat of which has hung over the business in the past.” Thanks to a surge in parcel delivery driven by the online spending boom, Royal Mail made a £311m pretax profit in its first half after barely scraping a profit a year earlier. Royal Mail said it handled 439m parcels in the three months to December, and said it was confident that a “structural shift” had occurred in parcel volumes since the start of the pandemic. Domestic parcel revenues increased by nearly 44% compared with 2019 levels, and fell by 4.9% year on year. Covid test kits made up a mid-single digit percentage of total parcel volumes in the first nine months of the year. Overall revenues dropped 2.4% year on year to £3.5bn in the quarter, but were up 17.1% compared with 2019 levels. As the Omicron variant spread, 15,000 Royal Mail staff were off sick or isolating in early January, leading to slower deliveries in some parts of the country. The company said absence levels were now improving. Complaints from customers have also jumped to a decade high, as Royal Mail received more than 1m last year. Keith Williams, the chair, said: “We delivered a solid performance over the Christmas period in particularly challenging circumstances operationally … We expected some decline in parcel volumes given most retail stores were open during the period, unlike last year. However, the trend towards customers wanting more parcels remains, and responding to that change efficiently is key. “Our domestic parcels business in the UK has seen demand increase by around a third over two years, as has our GLS business across its markets.” GLS is Royal Mail’s international parcel business, based in Amsterdam. He stressed the importance of Royal Mail’s modernisation plans in light of the fast-paced change and ongoing inflationary pressures. Mould said: “For a few years Royal Mail was delivering like the worst postie in the depot, parcels marked fragile launched over hedges, letters delivered to the wrong houses and so on, as it really struggled to modernise the business. “Now, helped by the massive growth in parcels being sent during the pandemic, it finally seems to be getting its act together.” Royal Mail shares rose 5% on Tuesday morning, making it the top riser on the FTSE 100.",News/Business,Royal Mail to cut 700 managers after Omicron delivery crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/jan/25/royal-mail-to-cut-700-managers-after-omicron-delivery-crisis

1/25/2022,"Whenever the Six Nations looms out of the wintry murk it is important to give a respectful nod to the gladiators of yesteryear. On Sunday, as it happens, one of the unsung heroes of English rugby also celebrated his 80th birthday in deepest Dorset, a suitable milestone for a man who coached his country to a grand slam in 1980, their first championship clean sweep since 1957. Mike Davis is 80 now and has Parkinson’s disease, but can still sometimes be found practising a few wedge shots on the playing fields adjoining his home in Sherborne. Even in his coaching pomp – he also won 16 caps as an England lock forward – it was never about him, whether he was teaching clumsy kids like us the rudiments of basketball, or tutoring the country’s best rugby players. Only the snug purple tracksuit bearing a red rose offered a clue to his ‘other’ sporting life.  That all-conquering 1980 side, captained by Bill Beaumont, was deservedly feted – not least for allowing England to escape with some dignity from the 1970s when, at one point, they collected three wooden spoons in a row. Once again, though, the curtain was to fall with a dull thud. By the start of the 1990s, the 1980 triumph under Davis’s unselfish guidance was still only the second grand slam England had managed since 1928. Which is why, 30 years on, it feels equally appropriate to remember the other great England side of the late 20th century who completed back-to-back grand slams in 1991 and 1992. In between they managed to lose a World Cup final but, in some respects, that adds a further dimension to their achievement. To place it into context, only one other men’s side in the past 98 years – France (1997 and 1998) – have captured the northern hemisphere holy grail twice in succession. The double grand slam remains a remarkable feat – even the greatest Welsh sides of the seventies never managed it. And not only did England re-enter the winners’ circle in 1992, they did so convincingly. Under Will Carling and Geoff Cooke, they established a new record for most tries scored in the Five Nations (15) and conceded just four, having kicked things off by beating Scotland 25-7 at Murrayfield in their opening match. Three decades later – and with Scotland awaiting Eddie Jones’s England on Saturday week – it is that game, rather than the explosive fixture at the Parc des Princes (of which more later) that Simon Halliday chooses as his most satisfying. Part of it was down to his own display – “I had one of those games when everything seemed to go my way” – and partly it was the psychological baggage finally jettisoned. “In 1986 we were thumped by 30 points at Murrayfield, 1988 was a kicking match on and off the field, then there was the grand slam that never was for us in 1990. I had real history with that venue.” Ireland were subsequently thumped 38-9 – Halliday recalls it as “one of the best Twickenham performances I can remember being part of” – and a fortnight later England set out for Paris. On paper they had every physical base covered – a pack consisting of Dean Richards, Peter Winterbottom, Mick Skinner, Wade Dooley, Martin Bayfield, Jeff Probyn, Brian Moore and Jason Leonard was always going to be forthright. Outside the half-back pairing of Dewi Morris and Rob Andrew also lurked more top operators with loads of big-match experience: Carling, Jeremy Guscott, Rory Underwood, the in-form Jonathan Webb and Halliday on the right wing. As Richards has subsequently recalled in the splendid, recently re-published paperback edition of Behind the Rose, staying cool and gently riling the French was a big part of the plan. “The policy was that if they hit you, you smiled and then gave them a wink to wind them up even more.” Moore had already irritated his hosts by publicly predicting “a boxing match” before kick-off. Sure enough, it all kicked off in earnest in the second half when two of France’s front-row, Grégoire Lascubé and Vincent Moscato, were sent off for stamping and a head-butt, respectively. The home crowd went similarly wild, causing the Irish referee Stephen Hilditch to be given a police escort off the field at the end. Halliday was as grateful as anyone to the Irish official following an incident five minutes after Moscato’s departure. “I slightly involuntarily body-checked their left winger and that entire side of the Parc des Princes tried to get me sent off. I remember saying to Hilditch: ‘I haven’t head-butted anyone, I haven’t stamped on anyone’s head, you can’t send me off for that.’” Once the dust had finally settled, though, England had scored four tries in Paris for the first time since the war and won 31-13. The final act, by comparison, was relatively comfortable. Wales were beaten 24-0 at Twickenham, with Carling scoring a try in the opening minute, after which Halliday reverted to his day job as a stockbroker. Carling has since said that his England side “were at the height of their powers” and history would appear to bear him out. Will anyone repeat the feat in this increasingly chien-eat-dog professional era? Maybe one day but England, warns Halliday, would currently be better off focusing on more immediate priorities. “This English team are going to have to play out of their socks to beat Scotland on Saturday week. Don’t listen to the people who say ‘It’s just another day at the office’. I think Scotland have a team that shouldn’t fear anyone.” As Davis, Halliday and every other old warrior can testify, the warm glow of past victories does not indefinitely protect against the chill blast of modern-day reality.

1/25/2022,"Here is a stylised and self-aware serial killer drama in black-and-white, broken down into nine “nights”. A young woman called Nada (Nour Hajri) picks up men in bars, playing on their protective gallantry or predatory instinct for weakness, by pretending to be vocally impaired and needing a voice app on her phone to speak. She goes home with them after a few drinks and horror ensues. But Nada finds herself vulnerable in falling for a young woman at her workplace, Noura (Rym Hayouni), who herself begins to realise what is happening in Nada’s after-hours existence. Black Medusa comes from first-time Tunisian film-makers Youssef Chebbi and Ismaël, who may conceivably be fans of Ana Lily Amirpour’s cult monochrome vampire film A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night. There is a scene when Nada is walking one of her victims back to his apartment and a couple of cats wander into view that reminded me of Amirpour’s very cat-friendly movie. And Nada’s deadpan and implacable avenger might put you in mind of Carey Mulligan’s assailant in Promising Young Woman.  The noir mood of menace and emotional deadness in Black Medusa has been very carefully contrived and curated. Perhaps the ultimate irony is that it is Nada who has been turned to stone. I wasn’t sure quite how far the procedural aspect of serial-killing takes us in this film, however – either as commentary on the macho culture of north Africa (or anywhere) or as a drama on its own terms. The approach is cool, blank, as if the film does not want to risk investing too much in what is happening. And I wasn’t sure how much was waiting for us at the end of the garden path along which we are being led. There are some very sharp moments, particularly one victim who starts sharing about how romance died between him and his long-term partner when they decided to get married: “We stopped being in love on our wedding day.”  Black Medusa is on Mubi from 28 January.",Arts/Film,Black Medusa review – deadpan North African vengeance noir,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/25/black-medusa-review-deadpan-north-african-vengeance-noir
1/25/2022,"About 1,100 coalminers in Alabama have entered 2022 still on strike, more than 10 months since they walked out back in April last year, making it the longest strike in the US since the Covid-19 pandemic began and the longest in Alabama’s history. Workers started the unfair labor practice strike over claims of bad faith bargaining by Warrior Met Coal over a new union contract. In the previous contract settled in 2016, miners accepted several concessions, including a $6-an-hour pay cut and reductions in health insurance and other benefits as the mines switched employers in the wake of a bankruptcy.  The miners on strike have received support from US politicians such as Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Tammy Baldwin and Sherrod Brown, and received donations to their strike fund from dozens of labor unions across the US. Over the past 10 months they have held rallies and extended protests to the Alabama state capitol to criticize the use of public resources for state troopers escorting strikebreaking replacement workers to the mines throughout the strike. Miners have also held rallies in New York City outside the offices of BlackRock Investment Group, the largest shareholder of Warrior Met Coal. As of 2 November, the strike has cost the company $6.9m. “Most of us are working other jobs and receiving strike pay but some have crossed the line,” said Rily Hughlett, a miner at Warrior Met Coal, who has worked as a roof bolter in the mines for 13 years and believes that workers will win the strike. “We’re not going anywhere. The scabs and the bosses are all humored but he who laughs last laughs loudest.” Since Warrior Met Coal took over the mines, the company has reported billions of dollars in revenue. A tentative agreement was reached in the first week of the strike, but overwhelmingly rejected by workers, and a new agreement has yet to be reached. “What they’ve said openly in negotiations is that they’re just going to starve us out. They’ve said … and this on record, that ‘we have the money to pay what you’re asking, we do not have the desire to.’ That’s the kind of company these guys have been working for,” said Haeden Wright, president of the United Mine Workers of America auxiliary for two of the striking locals and the wife of a striking miner. “Through the journey, most of us are still holding out and trying to hold on, but it is hard.” The unions’ auxiliary has focused on receiving and distributing weekly groceries to miners and their families throughout the strike and assisting families with needs such as bills. It recently organized a Christmas gift drive for miners’ families to ensure their children were taken care of over the holidays. “For it to last this long and to have state troopers and to watch your tax dollars escort scabs into your job, that’s a hard pill to swallow,” added Wright. “That’s hard to watch and not be able to do anything about.” Wright says that the strike has been hard but it has forced union members to strengthen their support systems with one another, and they have been able to spend a lot more time with their children and families after working 12-hour days, six or seven days a week in the mines. Those long and demanding work schedules are one point of contention for workers in a new union contract. Wright’s husband, Braxton, has taken a temporary job during the strike at Amazon in Bessemer, Alabama, where he has become involved in supporting the unionization efforts at the warehouse. A new union election ordered by the National Labor Relations Board is scheduled to begin next month. Warrior Met Coal has filed several court injunctions throughout the strike to severely limit or prevent striking miners from picketing outside the mines. Several union members and supporters have reported incidents where vehicles have hit or nearly missed individuals on the picket lines. The injunctions have been characterized as a rare move, an attempt by Warrior Met Coal to circumventthe NLRB and instead seek rulings from favorable local courts. “We’re still negotiating with them. We still have not reached an agreement but we’re hopeful that we can get something pretty soon here,” said Larry Spencer, the District 20 field representative for the UMWA in Alabama. He said the surge in Omicron cases during the pandemic and the holidays have made it more difficult to schedule negotiations on both sides, and the unions have paused picket lines temporarily to figure out how to comply with the court injunctions while ensuring members are kept safe. “Workers have fought really hard to try to stay united and keep solidarity out there. We have a rally once a week and we’ve had a good showing of members and their families come out,” added Spencer. “The key is the membership. They are the ones pulling together and really fighting hard to make sure they get what they deserve through this company and get back to work as soon as possible.” The US Department of Labor did not comment on whether its secretary, Marty Walsh, intended to intervene to assist in negotiations as he did with the 10-month-long nurses strike at St Vincent hospital in Worcester, Massachusetts, which ended with an agreement on 3 January. A spokesperson for the labor department said: “Workers with unions have the power to advocate collectively for the working conditions they deserve, like fair wages and safety on the job. Workplaces are safer and more productive when workers have a seat at the table. We encourage businesses and unions to come together and work toward solutions in good faith.” Warrior Met Coal has disputed claims that specific terms of previous contracts would be restored during the 2016 contract negotiations, and have rejected claims from workers and the union throughout the strike, but said it continued to negotiate in pursuit of a resolution.",News/Politics,Alabama coalminers on strike for 10 months vow not to be ‘starved out’,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/25/alabama-coalminers-warrior-met-coal-strike-10-months
1/25/2022,"Elaine Simons, a 61-year-old substitute art teacher in the Seattle, Washington area, was on a 10-month contract and hoping to settle into a more permanent role at the school where she was teaching when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the US in March 2020. Her school shut down for the remainder of the school year, with Simons having to pack up her classroom and learn to navigate the technology necessary to teach remotely. In June 2020, Simons was informed her teaching contract would not be renewed.  Some 5.7 million workers ages 55 or older lost their jobs in the US in March and April 2020, 15% of workers in an age demographic that has also experienced the vast majority of Covid-19 deaths. The unemployment rate for workers ages 65 and older hit a record rate of 7.5% in 2020. Simons was able to find a summer teaching position but had to file for unemployment assistance before the fall 2020 school year began. Since then, she has switched back and forth between taking periods of substitute teaching jobs whenever they’re available, and reverting to unemployment during periods where she’s been unable to find work. She found, despite claims of substitute teacher shortages, that longer term substitute contract positions weren’t being offered, and older workers at higher risk for Covid-19 like herself aren’t willing to take substitute gigs day by day, at various different schools without any compensation for quarantine if they catch or are exposed to Covid-19. Simons is fully vaccinated and boosted, but still worried about catching Covid-19 and exposing her elderly mother, whom she helps care for. “Some like myself are too young to retire, so I’m still looking for that dream job, I want my permanent job. I want to be fully set for my pension and my social security,” said Simons, who cannot afford to retire early because the social security benefits would be far too low to live on. Even with unemployment, Simons has had to rely on food banks, food donations, and mutual aid with neighbors. She has tried to get ahead on bills in anticipation of receiving no income if her unemployment benefits expire and she’s unable to obtain a new substitute contracting position, which has been more difficult as many employment resources offered to the unemployed, such as job counseling and training, have been limited during the pandemic. “I’m sad that at almost 62 years old, I don’t see the likelihood of getting employment at this point,” added Simons. “It’s really hard for people in my age bracket. I think that we’re feeling undervalued. We’re feeling missed. Nobody seems to care that we’re also part of the high risk community.” The unemployment rate has tumbled dramatically since the height of the pandemic but older workers are still struggling to find work despite all the reports of worker shortages. Jerry Jenkins, 63, of Lehigh Acres, Florida, lost his job at a manufacturing plant in 2021, where he had worked for seven years. With Florida’s maximum unemployment benefits among the lowest in the US, at $275 a week, Jenkins was forced to cash in part of his retirement savings as he is still trying to find another job. “I’m losing my retirement because no one will hire me. I can’t even get anybody to answer my resumes,” said Jenkins. “I’ve even tried to go back to some of the jobs I’ve had in my past to get rehired, but no one seems to be interested because I only have two or three years before retirement.” He expressed frustrations with the touting of falling unemployment rates, given he and millions of other workers aren’t classified as '“in the labor force” in part due to expired unemployment benefits. A June 2021 analysis by economists at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at The New School found at least 1.7 million more older workers than expected retired due to the pandemic. The analysis encouraged policy solutions such as expanding Medicare eligibility to the age of 50, expanding social security benefits, and creating a department dedicated to older workers at the US Department of Labor. Monique Morrisey, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, explained there are differences among affected older workers, with 55 to 64 year olds who are not eligible for Medicare and in most cases are not yet receiving social security, and workers 65 and older who left the workforce. The issues facing late middle age workers are more worrisome, given their economic demographics. “Among this younger group, the job losses are concentrated among non-college educated workers in lower paid jobs and are disproportionately also jobs that have high contact with the public,” said Morrissey. “It’s a lot harder to get another job when you’re an older worker.” A survey published by AARP in May 2021 found 78% of workers ages 40 to 65 reported either seeing or experiencing age discrimination in the workplace, the highest level found by AARP since they began surveying the question in 2003. More than half of jobseekers over the age of 55 were classified as unemployed for longer than 27 weeks in early 2021. As of October 2021, older workers were the furthest behind in employment recovery among age demographics. Beverly Matozzo of Deptford, New Jersey, worked about 12 hours a week at a school cafeteria for seven years, but was laid off once the school year ended last summer and she hasn’t been able to return as she is recovering from a knee injury and from Covid-19. Matozzo, 73, filed for unemployment, but has yet to receive any compensation because the office that assisted in filing her claim made an error with her working dates and she hasn’t been able to get the state unemployment agency to fix the problem and get her claim paid out. She has also been locked out of her account and still trying to resolve that issue. “I have been told a thousand different things. All I want is my 17 weeks of unemployment, which is what I am owed,” said Matozzo. “I’ve had to have three shots in my knee, walked with crutches for several weeks, and now I’ve just gotten over Covid. I just want to be with people. I enjoyed being around the kids, they make you feel alive and fun, so as soon as I can, I’m going back.” 57-year-old Dawn Leeson of Springhill, Florida, ran a nonprofit after-school program before Covid-19 forced her to shut down the program in March 2020, and she contracted Covid around the same time as her son was hospitalized in New Orleans. She receives social security disability benefits, which aren’t enough to survive on, and limits her options for new work. “My job is still not available. I’ve looked a little bit even though I’m not ready to go into the workforce because of my fears of Covid. I’m high risk and so is my partner,” said Leeson. “I know at this point I don’t have a lot of options. Who is going to want someone who is disabled and 57?” Leeson’s unemployment benefits were cut off in September 2021 when federal extended unemployment benefits ended without any further extensions, after it took her months to start receiving benefits due to long delays and backlogs. She has gone from having zero debt to accumulating about $10,000 in credit card debt in order to make ends meet over the past several months. “I barely leave my home, so I don’t have gas and car expenses. We eat cheaply. I’ve lost 5lbs mainly by eating just a sandwich for dinner most nights,” added Leeson. “I made it through the holidays, but I’m really scared about what comes next.” This article was written with the support of a journalism fellowship from the Gerontological Society of America, the Journalists Network on Generations and the RRF Foundation for Aging.",News/Society,"Too young to retire but at risk for Covid, older Americans struggle to find work",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/jan/25/older-americans-struggle-find-work-covid-retirement
1/25/2022,"Since the pandemic began almost two years ago, the monster that is Covid-19 has visited every corner of Earth, killing more than 5.5 million people. But we have fought back with astounding speed and vigour, and the situation today is very different from that in early 2020. Ten billion vaccine doses will have been administered worldwide by early February. The Covax scheme has delivered 1bn vaccines to lower-income countries. As a result, global daily deaths from the virus are at their lowest point in more than a year. So, is the monster slain? No. Covid-19 will not just disappear. Only one human infectious disease has been eradicated from the planet – smallpox – and that took nearly 200 years. Polio is near to extinction, but it has taken a 70-year campaign. Covid-19 may be even more troublesome. Unlike those viruses, Covid-19 has been able to easily adapt to find its way around human immunity (whether from infection or vaccination) so that it can survive. Omicron, or its progeny, will probably be with us for decades to come.  We don’t yet know exactly how the future of Covid-19 will manifest. Perhaps Covid-19 will decline and then return in regular seasonal waves, as with RSV and influenza. It is also possible that outbreaks at other times of year will continue, but get less spiky due to higher levels of immunity in the population. Have we learned how to fight back? Yes. What has changed most dramatically over the past 12 months is not the virus, but us. Immunity is the armour that means we can now walk the streets again. Vaccines have changed the world. But we must accept that protection against infection is, and will continue to be, incomplete. Over time, as the armour wears thinner, infections will occur again. But protection against severe disease will be largely maintained. We should not expect to return to the vulnerable situation we were in before the vaccines were first made, where we had to hide behind closed doors. (At least, not until the next pandemic, with a new disease, for which we must be better prepared.) This is why the next phase of the battle against Covid-19 must involve making vaccination available everywhere during 2022. With the huge increase in global capacity since the first doses were give 13 months ago, there really is no excuse for failure. However, we shouldn’t be overconfident about the universality of vaccine protection. There are still those without adequate immunity, either because they weren’t vaccinated (through choice or access) or because their bodies could not respond to vaccines, and there are also those with other frailties that make them vulnerable still, and on whom the virus will prey. Meanwhile, for those who remain vulnerable it is critical that we continue to develop and use new treatments for the virus, and to build resilience in our health systems to better cope with our Covid-19 future. Improving capacity in beds and staff will take time, but it is now life-savingly obvious that we must take this action to provide resilience in the face of pandemic threats, and even to cope with a normal year. Here in the UK, the strain on the NHS in normal times is distressing for those of us working on the inside, but has been laid bare for all to see during the pandemic. While it is unlikely to be necessary, financially viable or desirable to deliver booster vaccines to whole populations regularly, it seems very possible that some vulnerable individuals could benefit from them. We now need detailed analysis of infected patients arriving in hospitals in order to better assess who remains at risk and to decide whether and when to deploy such booster doses for vulnerable individuals. If future variants come and go as rapidly as appears to be the case with Omicron, it will be difficult to make modified vaccines quickly enough, and existing vaccines may have to be deployed. However, if a predictable coronavirus season is eventually established, as with flu, an annual update vaccine is absolutely feasible.

1/25/2022,"Nick Kyrgios clapped a hand over his mouth. Kyrgios is not easily shocked, but shocked he was. The poor kid he had accidentally cleaned up with a smash travelling around 200kmh was pretty stunned too. The young boy, sat a few rows from the front, winced. The umpire took the unusual step of climbing down from her chair and asking his mother if he was OK. No one really knew what to do, which was astonishing in itself given the raucous scenes at this doubles match and every other Kyrgios and Thanasi Kokkinakis have played at this Australian Open. Eventually Kyrgios shook himself conscious and jogged over to his bag, pulled out a fresh racket and ran it over to the boy. He smiled. Everyone else in Kia Arena wanted to get hit with a ball and go home with a souvenir.  This was always going to be a headline from this latest chapter of the Special Ks chronicles – well, until Kokkinakis told the crowd, on live TV, to “sink piss and come here” – but it fails to properly account for the rest of the show. And it was wild. Ticket-holders had snaked around the arena hoping to snag a seat to watch the Special Ks win a quarter-final most would not have even predicted them to be playing. The all-Australian wildcard pairing had already dumped top seeds Mate Pavić and Nikola Mektić out in straight sets. Now they set about unpicking this duo of New Zealander Michael Venus and German Tim Pütz in a to-and-fro contest that finished 6-4, 4-6, 6-4. It happened in front of what was, in every sense, an Australian crowd. Singleted, boisterous, irreverent and, frankly, histrionic. The cheers, chants and whistles could be heard from well outside the stadium. If Craig Tiley had been worried about ‘Where is Peng Shuai?’ T-shirt wearers adopting a mob mentality he needed look no further than this cacophony. Quite what their semi-final opponents, Marcel Granollers of Spain and Horacio Zeballos of Argentina, have made of all of it is anyone’s guess. “Unreal scenes,” Kyrgios said afterwards, before adding: “I’m not finished, I wanna win this thing to be honest.” The dreaded siuuus were audible but mixed with a fair bit of the more traditional “Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, oi, oi, oi” interspersed with Seven Nation Army and “Yeah the Kokk”. Flags were everywhere. Many were Australian. One was Greek. Home support can do many things for athletes. It had Kyrgios and Kokkinakis full of beans, riffing off each other, bumping chests and egging on the crowd. Every time they wanted more they got it. An ace elicited a standing ovation. A no-look drop shot brought four men in the front row to their knees in genuflection. Such ardent support can also affect the opponent. They were cheered, but only when they lost points. Venus had the misfortune of an errant ball toss, which meant his serve was sometimes accompanied by a wobbly “wayyyyyyyy”. By the end of the second set he was clearly irritated and complaining to the umpire about Kyrgios, who on his own serve tossed the ball up several times in jest before completing the full motion. Heated exchanges between the quartet ensued, but with every point the locals won the crowd offered the same immediate, euphoric reception. Australia might well have won the World Cup 30 times over within two hours and 16 minutes. Not since the Woodies has the doubles scene been this big. TV ratings have been off the hook, up there with the tournament’s main singles drawcards. The match was not initially given a slot on one the Nine Network’s main channels. Midway through the match the host broadcaster bumped Rafael Nadal v Denis Shapovalov off to make way. Kyrgios said that was “unexpected” but reasoned “the level of entertainment is different, I think”. Kokkinakis felt it was down to being able to “feed off each other – we can just talk rubbish in between points”. “I feel like we are just relatable,” Kyrgios continued. “I think that’s what’s the best thing about it. They go out and get behind their mates. Most of the guys in the crowd are our mates. We’ve got our team members that have been through injuries. “In Thanasi’s case and me, [we] have been around in some dark times. I guess tennis has always had personalities, and they have just really struggled to understand that there are different ways to go about it. You’ve got Roger Federer and these guys that are just once-in-a-generation athletes. I can’t be like that. We’re not like that. I feel it has to be people that are, I guess a little bit more relatable.” The pair have not planned past this tournament. As Kokkinakis pointed out, “we’re not doubles specialists”. Nothing about this was by design, and they may never be a team again. For now, though, they are rolling with it. “When we walk through that tunnel there’s no feeling like it,” Kokkinakis said. “We’re seeing these stands packed … we don’t want anything else, this is perfect. I haven’t played in a doubles match or even a singles match with an atmosphere like this. Hopefully Craig [Tiley] is watching and keeps us on this court. The rowdier the better from everyone, honestly. Sink piss and come here.”",Sport/Sport,Kyrgios and Kokkinakis revel in another wild showing of Special K double act,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/kyrgios-and-kokkinakis-revel-in-another-wild-showing-of-special-k-double-act-australian-open
1/25/2022,"Dylan Alcott – the tennis champion, Paralympian and disability advocate – has been named the 2022 Australian of the Year. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, made the announcement at an event in Canberra on Tuesday night after Alcott qualified for the Australian Open final where he’ll try and win his eighth title.  It is the first time in the annual awards program’s 62-year history that a person with a known disability has been named Australian of the Year, according to the award administrators. The Victorian, 31, has won 15 grand slam quad singles titles and another eight in doubles. In 2021 he became the first man in history to achieve a golden slam: all four major singles titles as well as gold at the Paralympics. A wheelchair user, Alcott has been open about his experiences of bullying and discrimination regarding his disability, particularly in his youth. He was born with a tumour wrapped around his spinal cord, which was successfully removed when he was three weeks old but left him a paraplegic. In 2017, he founded disability and accessibility training start-up, Get Skilled Access. He is also the founder of the Dylan Alcott Foundation which provides scholarships and grant funding to Australians with a disability. Alongside his sporting achievements, Alcott has a storied media career, having written an autobiography, Able; hosted a show on youth broadcaster Triple J; and appeared in numerous commentator and presenter roles across television, radio and podcasting. In 2009, at the age of 18, Alcott was awarded the medal of the Order of Australia. “Standing ovations are one of the most ironic things in the world, by the way, but I’ll take them, without a doubt,” Alcott said when accepting his award on Tuesday night. In a moving speech, Alcott described how he had known nothing but life with a disability, which racked him with self-loathing until he began to see people like himself in the broader community and learned from the those closest to him “that I was worthy and that I was allowed to be loved”. He urged non-disabled people to “challenge your unconscious biases, your negative perceptions and lift your expectation of what you think people with disability can do”. ​ Cracking jokes – he said “I also stand on the shoulders of giants, not literally, still can’t stand” – Alcott paid tribute to the disability activists who came before him including Kurt Fearnley and Stella Young. “It’s because of them and everybody in my life that I sit here as a proud man with a disability tonight. I love my disability. It is the best thing that ever happened to me.” Over the next 12 months, Alcott said he would focus on full NDIS funding and the prioritisation of people with a disability for rapid antigen testing and vaccination, as well as employment opportunities for disabled people. “As we start opening up from this pandemic, which is awesome, we’ve got to think about and prioritise people with disability,” he said. “We’ve got to get them the vaccines and the tests and whatever else they need so they can get out there and start living their life.” Alcott announced last year that he plans to retire from tennis after this year’s Australian Open. The awards for Senior Australian of the Year, Young Australian of the Year, and Australia’s Local Hero were also announced on Tuesday night. St John Ambulance volunteer Valmai Dempsey, 71, from Canberra, was named Senior Australian of the year. She has volunteered with St John Ambulance for more than 50 years, including during the black summer bushfires. Young Australian of the Year was awarded to Daniel Nour, 26, from NSW, a doctor who founded Street Side Medics, a not-for-profit delivering a free mobile medical service to people experiencing homelessness. Shanna Whan, 47, from Narrabri in NSW, was named Australia’s Local Hero. Whan is the founder and chief executive of Sober in the Country, a charity that offers peer support for those who are giving up alcohol, as well as education and advocacy around the harms of alcohol, particularly for rural communities. The chair of the National Australia Day Council, Danielle Roche, said Alcott was an “inspirational Australian on and off the tennis court” whose foundation was giving young disadvantaged Australians “the promise of a better future”. “Dylan Alcott is a champion who has risen to the top of the world rankings through sheer grit and determination. His golden slam is an incredible feat, the first for any male tennis player,” Roche said. Alcott takes the Australian of the Year baton from Grace Tame – a sexual assault survivor, activist, and critic of the Australian government, particularly its handling of the rape allegation made by former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins which is now the subject of criminal proceedings. A meeting between Tame and the prime minister at the Lodge for Australian of the Year celebrations on Tuesday went viral after pictures were captured of Tame looking unimpressed. Alcott also paid tribute to Tame on Tuesday night, saying she’d had “an absolutely incredible year”. “Tame, you are fierce and I love it,” Alcott said. “And you have done so much for your cause and if I could be one-eighth of the Australian of the Year that you were, I think I’ve done my job.” Alcott, who attended the ceremony in Canberra on Tuesday night, will return to Melbourne immediately to continue with his last ever pro tennis match – the Australian Open quad wheelchair singles final on Thursday.",Sport/Sport,Tennis star and Paralympian Dylan Alcott named Australian of the Year for 2022,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/25/tennis-star-and-paralympian-dylan-alcott-named-australian-of-the-year-for-2022
1/25/2022,"Ihave spent large portions of my life in virtual worlds. I’ve played video games since I was six; as a millennial, I’ve lived online since adolescence; and I’ve been reporting on games and gaming culture for 16 years. I have been to Iceland for an annual gathering of the players of EVE Online, an online spaceship game whose virtual politics, friendships and rivalries are as real as anything that exists outside its digital universe. I’ve seen companies make millions, then billions from selling virtual clothes and items to players eager to decorate their virtual selves. I’ve encountered people who met in digital worlds and got married in the real one, who have formed some of their most significant relationships and had meaningful life experiences in, well … people used to call it cyberspace, but the current buzzword is “the metaverse”.  Ask 50 people what the metaverse means, right now, and you’ll get 50 different answers. If a metaverse is where the real and virtual worlds collide, then Instagram is a metaverse: you create an avatar, curate your image, and use it to interact with other people. What everyone seems to agree on, however, is that it’s worth money. Epic Games and the recently rebranded Facebook are investing billions a year in this idea. When Microsoft bought video game publisher Activision for $70bn last week, it was described as “a bet on the metaverse”. The tech world seems to be leaning towards some kind of early 00s conception of wearing a VR headset and haptic suit and driving a flying car towards your perfect pretend mansion in a soothingly sanitised alternate reality, where you can have anything you want as long as you can pay for it. Look at Mark Zuckerberg’s now-infamous presentation of the future of his company, with its bland cartoonish avatars and emptily pleasant environments. It is the future as envisioned by someone with precious little imagination. I do not deny that some people want this vision. Ready Player One was a runaway hit. But the metaverse as envisioned by the people currently investing in it – by tech billionaires such as Zuckerberg and Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, by techbro hucksters selling astonishingly ugly generative-art NFTs and using words like “cryptoverse” – can only be described as spiritually bereft. It holds no interest for me. Virtual worlds can be incredibly liberating. The promise of cyberspace, right back to its inception, has been that it makes us all equal, allowing us to be judged not by our physical presentation or limitations, but by what’s inside our heads, by how we want to be seen. The dream is of a virtual place where the hierarchies and limitations of the real world fall away, where the nerdy dweeb can be the hero, where the impoverished and bored can get away from their reality and live somewhere more exciting, more rewarding. Anyone who is marginalised in the real world, though, knows that this is not how things go down. Virtual worlds are not inherently any better than the real one. Worker exploitation exists in them – look at World of Warcraft, in which Venezuelans farm currency to sell to first-world players, or Roblox, in which young game developers have put in long hours on unregulated projects for little reward. Misogyny and homophobia exist in them, too – ask anyone who’s ever had the misfortune to sound female on voice chat while playing a multiplayer shooter, or be non-gender-conforming on Twitch. As for racism, well – it is alive and well, and seemingly emboldened, in the digital world. The idea that a metaverse will magically solve any of these problems is a total fantasy. All that they really do is reflect the people that make them and spend time in them. Unfortunately, nothing I have experienced in any virtual world makes me feel good about the idea of the metaverse – because it is being constructed by people to whom the problems of the real world are mostly invisible. Unless companies put immense efforts into dismantling prejudices and unconscious biases, they are thoughtlessly replicated in whatever they create. Nobody has yet found a way to effectively moderate anywhere online to keep it free from abuse and toxicity and manipulation by bad actors. Given what’s happened with Facebook, do you trust Meta with this responsibility? Do you trust Microsoft with it? And what will the metaverse look like? Who gets to decide? Outside the sanitised aesthetic of the Zuckerverse (and old virtual-world standby Second Life), the main artistic references we currently have are either the gaudiness of Fortnite or Roblox or the no-holds-barred neon anime nightmare that is VRChat. Then there are the seemingly endless runs of vapid NFT art, many of which are tied to their own promised metaverses, drawing in their buyers with the promise of community. Every time I see a newly minted set of images (well, links to images) go up for sale I’m like, really? ANOTHER series of rad skulls? It is all just so powerfully adolescent, and yet apparently, they continually sell out. These are currently the people determining what the future might look like. It is depressing. I would feel better about the idea of the metaverse if it wasn’t currently dominated by companies and disaster capitalists trying to figure out a way to make more money as the real world’s resources are dwindling. The metaverse as envisioned by these people, by the tech giants, is not some promising new frontier for humanity. It is another place to spend money on things, except in this place the empty promise that buying stuff will make you happy is left even more exposed by the fact that the things in question do not physically exist. As far as I can work out, the idea is to take the principle of artificial scarcity to an absurdist extreme – to make you want things you absolutely don’t need. The problem is not that I think this won’t work. The problem is that I think it will. The current NFT gold rush proves that people will pay tens of thousands of dollars for links to jpegs of monkeys generated by a computer, and honestly it is eroding my faith in humanity. What gaping deficiency are we living with that makes us feel the need to spend serious money on tokens that prove ownership of a procedurally generated image, just to feel part of something? This is all happening, of course, while the Earth continues to heat up, and at enormous environmental cost. I can’t help but wonder if these giant companies are so intent on selling us and the markets on the idea of a virtual future in order to distract us all from what they are doing to the real one. I have seen what virtual worlds can do for people. I have spent my entire adult life reporting on them, and what people do in them and the meaning that they find there. So the fact that I’m now the one standing here saying that we don’t want this, feels significant. Meta has patented technology that could track what you look at and how your body moves in virtual reality in order to target ads at you. Is that the future of video games and all the other virtual places where we spend time – to have our attention continually tracked and monetised, even more so than it is in real life? The virtual worlds of games and the early internet used to be an escape from the inequalities and injustices of the real one. To see the tendrils of big tech and social media extending towards the places that have been a refuge for me and millions of others is disturbing. I don’t trust these people with the future. The more I hear about the metaverse, the less I want to do with it.",Arts/Games,I’ve seen the metaverse – and I don’t want it,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/25/ive-seen-the-metaverse-and-i-dont-want-it
