3/4/2022,"Ministers are understood to be examining ways of speeding up the sanctions process, amid fears that targeting the government’s full hitlist of more than 100 Russian oligarchs could take as long as six months, because of legal hurdles. The government has come under intense pressure in recent days over the pace at which it is taking action against individuals with links to the Kremlin, despite the prime minister’s promise last week to “squeeze Russia from the global economy, piece by piece”. There is widespread internal frustration that preparatory work for legal cases against a number of individuals has only just now begun, after months of warning about a Russian invasion. “It’s a big cross-Whitehall process between the Home Office and the Foreign Office – which should have started months ago – and it’s exposing the system’s weaknesses,” one Whitehall source said. “The government is weeks behind where it should be.” Whitehall insiders claim that the Sanctions Act of 2018, passed after Brexit, makes the procedure legally cumbersome, with overstretched government lawyers now facing a vast caseload. They said the Foreign Office was likely to announce the names of more sanctioned individuals “very soon” and would then continue to work painstakingly through a much longer list of figures. The levelling-up secretary, Michael Gove, is understood to be considering plans to toughen up the government’s powers, so that sanctioned oligarchs’ properties could be seized without compensation – rather than just frozen. One suggestion is that such properties could then be used to house Ukrainian refugees. Johnson’s official spokesperson rejected the idea that the government was acting too slowly, suggesting that measures targeting banks and other Russian companies would be more effective in cutting off funding for the Putin regime. “We are prioritising what we think will have the biggest impact first,” he said. However, he also effectively conceded that legal constraints were preventing ministers from moving faster, saying “we are just making sure we have done the requisite work that meets the legal bar”. He said there was a “constant review of whether we can do more to go even faster”. One government aide said that requisitioning individuals’ property “jars” with the UK’s tradition of upholding the rule of law, and offering security to investors – though they denied there was any dissent within government about pressing ahead. “We’re going full tonto on this, within the parameters of the rule of law,” the aide said. Institutional caution among government lawyers has been blamed by some Tories, but a government source said the UK’s sanctions regime, newly separate to the EU, was relatively untested, apart from the narrow Magnitsky sanctions’ focus. The source emphatically denied there was a lack of political will and said senior cabinet ministers had been repeatedly raising the issue and asking questions about why the UK appeared behind. Frans Timmermans, the European commission’s first vice-president, accused the UK of lagging behind on Thursday. “I don’t hesitate to say this,” he told the BBC. “The UK is now following our lead. And I’m sure they will continue to follow the lead because the pressure of the public opinion in the UK is very clear about this.” Separately, the Guardian understands the government is preparing to toughen up the long-delayed economic crime bill, after pressure from Labour – including by cutting the 18-month implementation period for a new register revealing the ultimate owners of UK properties. The legislation is aimed at preventing kleptocrats from parking what Johnson has called their “ill-gotten gains” in UK property. Guardian analysis suggests oligarchs who have already been sanctioned by the EU or the US are linked to almost £200m of property in London and the home counties. Labour had warned that the 18 months’ grace contained in the draft bill would give oligarchs time to “quietly launder their money”, and tabled an amendment that would remove it. It is understood that Downing Street and the business department do not intend to accept the amendment – but are instead working on their own changes to the bill, with government sources insisting they would have done this irrespective of Labour pressure. It has not yet been decided how much the grace period will be reduced. The bill is also now expected to include a promise to act rapidly in tightening up the anti-fraud procedures used by Companies House, the body that maintains the register of UK firms. The shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, called on the government to bring forward legislation next week to speed up the process. “It is totally unacceptable that a week after Putin’s illegal invasion of Ukraine just 11 oligarchs have faced sanctions by the UK government. Ministers had months to prepare for this eventuality, with the full support of parliament, and there is no excuse for their failure to introduce strong enough laws in the first place,” he said. “The government’s failure to keep pace with the EU and the US on sanctions is allowing Putin-linked oligarchs to salvage hundreds of millions in assets.”",News/UK news,UK looking at ways to speed up sanctions against Russian oligarchs,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/mar/03/uk-looking-at-ways-to-speed-up-sanctions-against-russian-oligarchs
3/4/2022,"Hello and Happy Thursday, In an unexpected move last Friday, a Memphis judge ordered a new trial for Pamela Moses, the Black Lives Matter activist who was sentenced to six years in prison for trying to register to vote. The decision to order a new trial was in part based on new evidence I obtained and wrote about in this newsletter last week. W Mark Ward, the judge in the case, ruled prosecutors should have turned over that evidence to Moses’ lawyers before the trial. The document, an internal email from the department of corrections, showed officials had investigated why a probation officer signed off on a form telling Moses she was eligible to vote when she actually was not. The investigation found that the officer had made a good-faith error. Moses’ lawyers had never seen that document. Amy Weirich, the district attorney, said the Tennessee department of corrections never provided the document to her office. Moses was released from prison on Friday. Weirich’s office now has to decide whether to appeal Ward’s ruling, drop the charges, or retry the case. A spokesman for her office did not respond to several inquiries. I’ll be following closely whatever happens next. But I also want to focus on the reason Moses’ case attracted so much attention in the first place: her harsh punishment. This morning, we published a piece that digs into why that six-year sentence struck such a nerve. It’s impossible to talk about the Moses case without talking about race. Many compared it to cases in which white people who committed more intentional acts of fraud merely received probation. There were the white men in Pennsylvania and Nevada who voted on behalf of dead family members and received probation. Or the white man who impersonated his son at the polls and also got probation. And of course, the numerous defendants who have received far less punitive sentences for storming the Capitol. “It shows the disparity,” said Linda Harris, a lawyer who is seeking the Democratic nomination to challenge Weirich. “Why was this case prosecuted so vigorously?” “It illustrates the immense discretion that prosecutors have,” said Steven Mulroy, a law professor at the University of Memphis and a Democrat who is also running for district attorney. “It raises the real spectre that at least implicit bias is factoring into these discretionary decisions.” At the same time, Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia, told me that it’s really difficult to draw conclusions by comparing prosecutions in different jurisdictions. “Ours is not a state-based criminal justice system, it’s a county based criminal justice system. Where, even within a state, you could have very large disparities across counties in the way a case is prosecuted. Or whether it’s prosecuted at all,” he said. “Discretion is something we both value as a means of achieving individualized justice and fear as a potential vehicle for discriminatory treatment.” In Moses’ case, I was also interested in whether Moses’ harsh sentence was influenced by the fact that she had several prior felonies. In his original sentencing order, Ward pointed to those felonies to justify the sentence. What went unsaid was the underlying fact that people with felony convictions face immensely confusing rules about whether or not they can vote. Regulations vary widely by state and Tennessee has some of the most inscrutable in the US. And once someone already has a felony, The consequences of making a mistake become more severe In a statement, Weirich also noted that she offered Moses a plea deal that would have kept her out of prison, but Moses refused it and wanted to take her case to trial. It reminded me of the case of Crystal Mason, a Texas woman who was also sentenced to years in prison for a voting mistake, even though she said she had no idea she was ineligible. The Texas prosecutor in that case similarly noted she had offered Mason a plea deal that didn’t involve prison, but that Mason rejected it. “People are asking, why is it we have a system where a prosecutor can basically say to somebody, you plead, we’ll extend your probation. If you don’t plead, you’re facing six years,” Capers said. “If she had taken the plea, nobody would have known about this case.” A long-anticipated Republican review of the 2020 election in Wisconsin argued that lawmakers could “decertify” Joe Biden’s victory in the state – something that is not legally possible. New voting restrictions loomed over the Texas primary, where progressive notched key wins and a Donald Trump ally suffered a major blow. A federal judge in Georgia declined to impose new electoral maps in the state, even though he found evidence that the ones Republicans passed last year were illegal.",News/US news,Harsh punishments for Black Americans over voting errors spark outcry | The fight to vote,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/03/fight-to-vote-newsletter-pamela-moses-memphis-case
3/4/2022,"This intense two-hander is one of Dennis Kelly’s earlier plays (it premiered in 2005) and it hasn’t aged brilliantly. Set in a nuclear bunker, where two colleagues cower in the wake of an explosion, it feels naive in the questions it asks about the imbalance of power between the sexes, and tired in its contrived construction. Above all, I’m not convinced the questions asked, or the “entertainment” generated, are worth the violence Kelly unleashes on stage. There’s an air of whimsical comedy to Lyndsey Turner’s production, which for me doesn’t sit right in a play that journeys to such upsetting places. As office workers Mark and Louise gradually turn on each other, with the man predominantly in a position of control, Tingying Dong’s jangling music blasts out in between the scenes, filling the theatre with a tinny energy. A frame of white lights flashes brightly and briefly blinds us, teasing us with what fresh horrors might lie ahead. Peter McKintosh’s stage design looks deliberately fake; it has the overly precise and slightly too-tidy look of a TV studio set. The escape hatch is positioned tantalisingly out of reach. Sometimes the hatch is lit up, as if all this were a game or TV show until suddenly, horribly, it isn’t. Nick Blood’s office-worker Mark, who bought his flat expressly because it had a bunker at the bottom of the garden, wouldn’t look out of place on Peep Show. Blood is engaging but he has a way of talking – a familiar “nerdy” accent and comic timing – that feels like a shortcut to his character. We’ve seen this Mark many times before; he doesn’t feel particularly considered or complex. Amaka Okafor convinces as the popular and conceited Louise but, again, her character feels thin and her reactions manufactured. There’s a final scene, and another surprise twist, that is possibly meant to be empowering. But it doesn’t feel that way. In fact, it’s all a bit depressing – a crude depiction of violence that doesn’t say anything new while making me feel those all too familiar jolts of disgust and fear.

3/4/2022,"So in the end the Roman empire at Chelsea has lasted nearly 19 years, a lot longer than many thought when he bought the club in summer 2003 but, until recent cataclysmic geopolitical events, less than I expected given his clear love of the club and continued on-field success. Many seem to forget that in the six years before Roman Abramovich bought the club Chelsea won two FA Cups, a League Cup and the European Cup Winners’ Cup so were hardly the mess some portray. What he did do was quickly take Chelsea to the rarefied next step, allowing world-class managers (such as José Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Antonio Conte) and players to join, ushering in a trophy-laden two decades any new owner will find it very hard to replicate. He became a very effective disruptor, upsetting the cosy world at the top of English and European football, and was clearly resented because of this. Two Champions Leagues. Two Europa Leagues. Five Premier League titles. Myriad domestic cups. So many memories for me. Watching us win the league at Bolton and West Bromwich. Being in Munich, Amsterdam, Baku and Porto to see European trophies being lifted. Watching world-class overseas signings such as Arjen Robben, Claude Makelele, Didier Drogba, Michael Ballack, Eden Hazard and Thiago Silva wear a Chelsea shirt. A quality of player and a selection of trophies and memories unthinkable to those of us watching the side in the Division Two dog days of 1979-83. The unsentimental and ruthless firing of managers was sometimes uncomfortable for many supporters but it is hard to argue, in retrospect, that those decisions were not justified, with the possible exception of Ancelotti. The sacking of Frank Lampard was decried by many but the appointment of Thomas Tuchel was a masterstroke, leading to Champions League glory months later. Abramovich was very much in the background, very rarely giving interviews and content to let his executives run the club on a day-to-day basis, though clearly he intervened on the major strategic issues. Those who thought he would get bored, or would use the club as a public plaything, were proved wrong. My view is that he genuinely loves the club but that he has done the right thing, and indeed the only plausible course of action given current circumstances, by signalling his clear intention to sell. I have no idea whether he has close links to the Putin regime – he says he does not – but his statement, his gesture in writing off the massive loans to the club and the commitment to using proceeds of the sale “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine”, to me send a pretty strong message. His legacy, apart from the wonderful memories, includes two world-class managers (Tuchel and Emma Hayes), a bunch of world-class players in the men’s and women’s teams and a superbly run academy producing high-quality stars of the future on a regular basis. My reading is that the vast majority of supporters appreciate all he has done for the club and are hugely grateful for the 19 years of unparalleled (in Chelsea terms) success. In terms of the future there has to be some trepidation among supporters. The thought of owners taking over and piling debt on to the club in the style of the Glazers or Hicks and Gillette is not a happy one. Will a new regime want Tuchel? Will he want to hang around? Creating a fully functioning new club hierarchy, potentially from scratch, will be far from easy, as other clubs have found. The club tried, and spectacularly failed, to buy back Chelsea Pitch Owners shares in 2011 and, if a new owner tries again, then they can look forward to another battle with supporters. Shelved plans to build a 60,000 super-stadium may presumably be revived but, given that would require moving away from Stamford Bridge for three to four years during construction, that would inevitably be a fraught process. The enormous goodwill Abramovich has built up with the Chelsea supporter base since 2003 will need to be earned by new owners, and that will certainly not be as easy as the Amanda Staveley brigade found it at Newcastle. Abramovich’s investment turned Chelsea into a genuinely world-class club, as evidenced by the recent World Club Cup success. Whoever takes over will have a really tough job to consolidate and build on that.

3/4/2022,"Europeans should turn down their thermostats by a degree to save on gas and reduce dependency on Russian imports, which Russia is wielding as a weapon in the Ukraine war, the world’s leading energy adviser has said. Governments in Europe should also impose a windfall tax on fossil fuel companies that have enjoyed a bonanza from soaring energy prices, and use it to cut energy bills for hard-pressed consumers, according to a 10-point plan formulated by the International Energy Agency that would reduce Russian gas imports by about a third before next winter. The planned closure of several nuclear power stations should also be delayed, red tape should be cut to bring forward the construction of more wind and solar generation and efforts to improve energy efficiency in homes and businesses must be stepped up urgently, the IEA said. Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, the global energy watchdog, said: “Russia is using its natural gas resources as an economic and political weapon. This is clear to everyone in the world.” Adjusting home thermostats by 1C would save about 10bn cubic metres of gas within a year, a useful saving on total Russian gas imports of 155bn cubic metres, if implemented alongside the other measures. Birol said: “It would help to reduce [household] energy bills, but maintain comfort.” The 10-point plan also includes advice to governments not to sign any new gas contracts with Russia, or renew expiring deals; to set a minimum obligation on energy companies to store gas; to speed up the replacement of gas boilers with heat pumps; and to seek alternative gas supplies from elsewhere in the world. The EU relies on Russia for about 40% of its gas consumption. Gas prices have soared to record levels in recent months, in part owing to the global economic rebound from Covid-19, but also because Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, engineered a reduction of about 25% in Russian gas supplies to Europe in recent months, in preparation for his invasion. Barbara Pompili, minister for ecological transition for France, holder of the EU’s revolving presidency, said: “More than ever, getting rid of Russian fossil fuels and of fossil fuels in general is essential. What is at stake is both the need to accelerate the fight against climate change and, as we can see now, the short-term energy security of the European continent.” The European Commission will use the IEA’s proposals to inform its own plan of action on energy in response to the Ukraine war, to be published next week. Kadri Simson, the EU’s energy commissioner, said the bloc had already been moving away from gas but that the Ukraine war made it more urgent. “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a watershed moment,” she said. The UK government is also understood to be urgently examining its exposure to gas market turbulence, caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The UK does not directly contract with Russia for pipeline gas, as Germany and some other EU countries do, as UK gas supplies come mainly from the North Sea, Norway and some tanker deliveries, but the impacts on the prices and availability of gas are felt internationally. Rob Gross, director of the UK Energy Research Centre and professor of energy policy at Imperial College London, said some of the IEA’s findings could apply to the UK. “Accelerating the deployment of renewables projects, getting on with energy efficiency, [and] maximising output from nuclear stations are all no-brainers in both the UK and EU,” he said. “However, we should not expect that we can magic the capacity to retrofit our houses into existence in no time at all.” The UK could be more exposed than its EU neighbours to gas market turbulence. The government allowed the UK’s last large-scale gas storage facility to close in 2017, despite warnings on how it would affect resilience. After Brexit, the government also opted out of an EU pact to share gas storage in the event of supply constraints. Gross warned: “We will be reliant on attracting gas by paying the market rates. We can secure enough gas but we have to pay the price.” Even if all of the IEA’s advice is followed, the result will be only to reduce EU need for Russian gas by about a third, leaving Europe still heavily reliant on Putin’s control of Russian fossil fuel resources. The IEA said its advice was consistent with the EU’s plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions, the European green deal, and would not require any increase of fossil fuel use. However, if Putin were to cut European gas supplies further, causing gas prices to rise even higher than current levels, the EU could come under pressure to expand its use of coal instead of cutting it.",News/Environment,"Turn down heating by 1C to reduce need for Russian imports, Europeans told",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/mar/03/turn-down-heating-reduce-need-russian-imports-europeans-told
3/4/2022,"It’s a strange time to be a pacifist in Britain. Everywhere there are calls for an end to the war in Ukraine: from politicians to Premier League footballers to hand-painted pleas for peace in people’s front windows. The illegitimacy and brutality of the Russian invasion make it very easy to condemn. Yet at the same time, some of Britain’s most longstanding peace activists are being attacked and threatened. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, has accused the Stop the War coalition, which has opposed conflicts for more than 20 years, of being “at best … naive” and “at worst … showing solidarity with the aggressor”. Eleven Labour MPs who signed a Stop the War statement about Ukraine, including veterans such as John McDonnell and recently elected leftwingers such as Zarah Sultana, were told that they could be expelled from their parliamentary party if they did not remove their names. All the MPs complied. From what was until recently quite a loosely managed political party, it was a strikingly aggressive disciplinary action. The statement in dispute does not seem outrageous. Published before the invasion, it “opposes any war over Ukraine”, calls for “a diplomatic settlement”, and criticises the British government for “aggressive posturing” and Nato for its “eastward expansion”. There is less criticism of Russia than its own, much more violent, expansionism merits; but little sign of the alleged “solidarity with the aggressor”. “We do not endorse the nature or conduct of either the Russian or Ukrainian regimes,” the statement says. “The crisis should be settled on a basis which recognises the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination and addresses Russia’s security concerns.” Such even-handedness may seem horribly inappropriate now. But the interests of both sides may have to be satisfied if this crisis is ever going to end. That Stop the War’s stance has provoked what its convenor, Lindsey German, described at a rally last weekend as “a serious backlash” – including a death threat against Sultana – suggests that the space in British politics for pacifism, or even for scepticism about military institutions such as Nato, is dramatically shrinking. Only two years ago, Labour was led by a peace campaigner and Nato critic, Jeremy Corbyn. Now his successor hails helping to found Nato as one of Labour’s “great achievements”, on a par with creating the NHS. The vaguely defined “security” that Starmer has been offering voters, without much success, is suddenly coming into focus as a militaristic project. You may welcome this as Labour getting real again. The party has a tradition of supporting military action against extremists and aggressors, from the second world war to the Falklands, Afghanistan and Iraq. For a party often characterised regardless as unpatriotic, unrealistic and weak, supporting wars and increasing defence spending can be an appealing tactic. Recent research by the British Foreign Policy Group (BFPG) showed British military interventions most strongly supported by older, white, leave-voting men outside London: exactly the voters that Starmer has prioritised winning back. The more moral left-of-centre case for militarism was summed up in 1942 by George Orwell. “Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist,” he wrote, as it effectively helped the Nazis. The idea that you could live “aloof” from the war was an “illusion”: the war affected everyone’s lives. Sometimes, a lack of perspective undermines pacifism in general. Anti-war activists don’t always acknowledge how common violence is in peacetime – in coercive modern capitalism, for example. But more often, pacifists are more worldly than their critics claim. At a packed Stop the War rally in London on Wednesday, speakers talked about poverty, inequality and austerity as well as the military situation. Apologists for Russia were conspicuous by their absence. “There is nothing progressive about Putin’s Russia,” said the longstanding anti-war campaigner Tariq Ali, to loud applause. Corbyn accurately described it as a regime of “robber barons”. The idea that pacifists are dupes or tools of the enemy surfaces in Britain every time there is a war. Despite that, a lot of voters are consistently anti-war. The BFPG found almost a fifth opposed British interventions under any circumstances. They are nearly always under-represented in parliament. Except for rare large rebellions such as those over Iraq and Syria, “unity” is prized during wars. Anyone who believes in democracy ought to be uneasy when they hear that word. Sometimes pacifists are naive, for example about Hitler in the 1930s. Yet the same criticism could be made of the supposed realists who backed the Afghan and Iraq wars. Often, not fighting is the least bad option, which is why most countries rarely do. British parochialism – and the shaping of opinion by our huge defence industry – stops us seeing how unusually warlike we are. For now, our politicians are resisting the temptation to directly confront the Russians. But it’s a very bellicose kind of restraint – hence Starmer’s fury at Stop the War, which opposes arming Ukraine. And the desire here for peace feels like it could easily flip over into its opposite. At last Saturday’s demonstration outside Downing Street against the invasion, chants of “Stop the war” were followed by other ones from the most Ukrainian parts of the crowd: “Shelter our sky” – impose a no-fly zone – and “Arm Ukraine”. With a new cold war or worse starting, the peace movement is going to become both more demonised and more vital. People who loudly refuse to accept that the world is divided into two camps, whatever horrors are being committed by one of them, can seem foolish, disloyal, even lacking in basic morality. But without them, our politics will be left to warmongers and their suppliers.
