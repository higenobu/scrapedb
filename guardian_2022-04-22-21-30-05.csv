4/22/2022,"It seems clear that we can only expect to be disappointed by the workings of our Home Office. I wonder if anyone else has shared my latest experience of its careless inefficiency? On Monday evening at about 5pm, I submitted the form for a visa application for a Ukrainian family I am sponsoring under the Homes for Ukraine scheme. At 5.44pm, I received acknowledgment of the form from UK Visas and Immigration, followed at 7.01pm by further confirmation from the TLS Contact team. On Tuesday, to my delighted astonishment, I received an email, sent at 3.20pm, from which the following is the relevant extract: “We are pleased to say that a decision has been made on your Ukraine Scheme visa application. Please find attached to this email a permission to travel letter. You will need to show this, along with your passport, to the airline, train, or ferry company you are travelling to the UK with. You will also need to show it at the UK border.” This was followed by another email at 3.21pm thanking me for my application, “currently being prepared for consideration by an entry clearance officer”. At 5pm I opened a third email sent at 3.25pm and headed “Please ignore previous email”, followed by a repeat of what was in fact the previous email sent at 3.21pm, as opposed to the one from 3.20pm, which presumably was the one to be ignored. I am pleased at least that I had given my email as the contact and not the email of the Ukrainian family concerned.

4/22/2022,"At this stage it’s honestly hard to know what the Queen thinks of her imminent platinum jubilee. On the one hand, the outpouring of patriotic pageantry will provide a perfect distraction from all the terrible things her family keeps doing. But on the other, she’s going to have to sit through an awful lot of faff. This week, the centrepiece of this faff was announced. Set within the grounds of Windsor Castle, the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebration will take place in front of a live audience of 4,000, and reportedly cover 400 years of British history. Helen Mirren will play Queen Elizabeth I and deliver a speech from 1588. There will be a long section about the Gunpowder Plot. There will be a lot of horses; 500 of them, in fact. And Katherine Jenkins. And Ant and Dec. It sounds tortuous. The Queen has had to put up with this sort of thing for 70 years now. You can’t help but feel that she’d probably just prefer a quiet night in with the snooker. As tedious as the whole thing sounds, one thing alone will save the day. That thing, slightly unbelievably, is Tom Cruise. The show will reportedly be formed of four acts. Mirren will host one, Damian Lewis, Adjoa Andoh and Alan Titchmarsh will host the others, but they are all set to be blasted out of the water by Cruise’s turn. Nobody knows why this is happening or how it came to be, but it doesn’t matter. You will watch the Queen’s platinum jubilee celebration, just because someone booked Tom Cruise for it. Realistically, nobody knows which Cruise will turn up. We may get the showboating action star, who will arrive on stage after leaping out of an exploding fighter jet before singlehandedly foiling the Gunpowder Plot by karate-kicking Guy Fawkes’s head clean off his shoulders. We may get overly reverent Cruise, who will be so humbled by his surroundings that he’ll lose focus and mangle the word “Leicestershire” beyond all recognition. If he wants to make friends, he’ll turn up with a T-shirt cannon loaded with coconut cake and blast slices straight into the mouths of his audience. If he wants to be memorable, he could Man v Food his way through a pile of identical curries. We simply just don’t know. However, it would be wrong to assume that he can waltz into Windsor and run away with the whole show. If the Queen does turn up to watch the thing – and that’s still a big if, given her recent health concerns – then Cruise runs the risk of being second banana to Titchmarsh. I mean it. If you’re the Queen, Titchmarsh is always going to be the real draw here. Think of all the shows the woman has been forced to endure in the last 20 years alone. Brian May played guitar on her roof and she couldn’t crack a smile. Atomic Kitten sang Dancing in the Street and she couldn’t have looked more bored. At this stage in her life, the woman has been subjected to the equivalent of 300 hours of elongated Paul McCartney Hey Jude singalongs, and the strain is definitely showing. Perhaps the closest thing to Cruise that the Queen has ever encountered is the James Bond skit she performed at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics, in which she pretended to jump out of a helicopter. Remember, this was Bond – a decades-old touchstone of British culture – and the woman scowled through the whole thing like she had a gun to her head. You sense that maybe, just maybe, she might not have seen Vanilla Sky. The only time that the Queen has palpably expressed any enthusiasm for anything in public is that gif where she saw some cows, pointed at them and delightedly shouted the word “Cows!”. Titchmarsh is the personification of that cow gif. He’s all dirty fingernails and wax jackets. If the Queen can summon the energy to attend this event, it will be solely so she can see him, point at him and shout “Titchmarsh!”. Cruise might be one of the most famous men of all time, but even he can’t compete with star power like that.",Arts/Film,Cruise v Titchmarsh: a right royal smackdown at the Queen’s platinum jubilee,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/apr/22/tom-cruise-v-alan-titchmarsh-smackdown-at-the-queens-platinum-jubilee
4/22/2022,"On any given Friday, Saturday or Sunday night, it’s likely Aly Meghani will be relishing in a night out in central London, where the clubs, pubs and bars have returned to their spirited state. The 25-year-old content manager from Ealing has been going out more than usual since lockdown restrictions were lifted in February. The reason? Making up for lost time, said Meghani, and the fear of missing out. “Obviously everything is so packed nowadays, you’ve got to make the most of what you can. Even if it’s just if you’re outside, you’ve got to be doing something,” said Meghani, flanked by a group of friends in Soho. It’s the return of “out out” a distinction popularised by the comedian Micky Flanagan, who differentiated between a regular night out, and “out out”, which is staying out later, longer, and clearing your schedule the following day. In London’s Soho, the streets were thrumming on Wednesday evening, with the sound of people returning to venues in an attempt to make up for lost time. While some took part in birthday celebrations, others couldn’t help but note the sense of normality that has returned. The optimism has been observed elsewhere. The club owner Rekom has found evidence that Britons who came of age during the pandemic are not only turning up earlier on nights out but spending more on drinks in clubs and bars than in March 2020. It’s a significant recovery that has allowed the group to open at least 10 more bars this year. After buying 42 of the former Deltic Group’s UK clubs and bars out of administration in January 2021, the Copenhagen-based Rekom now has 48 UK outlets, taking back some of its former sites and adding new ones. Yet Rekom’s gains come as the economy shrinks. As the inflation rate reached the highest levels since 1992 last month, experts forecast Britain could fall into recession this summer. “We haven’t experienced the consumer price squeeze yet,” said Peter Marks, chairman of Rekom, “but most of our guests are under 25 and they are not the people paying the electric bill, filling the car or paying the mortgage.” According to Rekom, just over 60% of 18- to 24-year-olds said they were more enthusiastic about going out to clubs and festivals because of missing out during the pandemic, and almost half of 25- to 34-year-olds said the same. That’s not the case for everyone though. While some people who spoke with the Guardian said they’re going out more, others had emerged from the pandemic tamer and more considerate on their nights out. Lauren Bude and Millie Jones, university students from Surrey and Nottingham, were visiting London for a friend’s birthday. When asked if they’re going out more, they chimed in unison: “Yes, definitely.” But are they spending more? No, said Bude, who described herself financially as a “tight queen”. Jones added that she is spending the same amount as before the pandemic struck. For Bude, 21, however, nights out aren’t a matter of making up for lost time but rather “just getting back to normal” after not going out at all during the pandemic. “Now it’s easier to do,” added Jones, 20. “There’s less risk.” The threats from coronavirus were particularly acute for Simba Munson, a Sainsbury’s employee and frontline worker throughout the pandemic. “It was hard,” said Munson, who was celebrating his 34th birthday in Soho. “I was working through the whole pandemic. I’m a bit tired, and I’m getting older now, I just can’t be bothered.” When he does go out, however, Munson tends to stay out later to make the most of it, he said. When asked if he is spending more, he joked: “Well I’m not, but my boyfriend is. “You need the freedom,” added Munson. “Everyone’s been cooped up for so long that you need to be out there.” Evidence suggests that since March 2020, the total number of licensed venues in the UK has shrunk by 8%, with 9,200 fewer sites. According to the consultancy CGA and the advisory firm AlixPartners, independent operators bore the brunt of it, with 8.7% closing, and 4.8% of chains or managed pubs closed. Karl Chessell, CGA’s director for hospitality operators and food for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says there is “a lot of turmoil going on” due to staffing, supply issues and heavy inflationary pressures. He expects a steady flow of closures and openings as the year progresses but, overall, for consumer demand and investor confidence to remain strong. For Ilhan Hassan, 26, the discussion of whether people are going out and spending as much as before the pandemic is already outdated. “It’s a bit late to have that conversation, in my opinion,” said Hassan. She started going out again last year, making up for lost time. “This year we’ve been doing it,” said Hassan, surrounded by a group of friends. “Nothing new.” Typically, she will go out twice a week. If that means she’s out until 5am, she will be, Hassan added. If not, she will settle for the latest hour possible. “If the opportunity presents itself, I’ll be dancing until the sun comes out,” said Hassan as the group made their way to the next bar. “Once again, it’s my birthday.” Much like dancing, your going out style might be a bit rusty. Here are four tips to make sure your return to a club is as stylish as it is joyous. It’s a rookie move to wear something you treasure to a club. You’ll either end up worrying about it all night, or with fomo from standing in the cloakroom queue. Instead, have a “clubbing coat” that keeps you warm but one you can stuff behind a speaker without too much stress. A bomber jacket or a fleece is perfect. Go for a small bag that you can wear crossbody or around your waist, with lots of zips. John Lewis’s Kin bag or bumbag from Fila or similar would work. Note: wear said bumbag around your shoulder not waist to update your clubbing look from 1989 to 2022. Remember a night out can involve time waiting outside in a queue, and time on a dancefloor. To keep your style cool in both instances, you’ll need a hoodie (a classic of the out-out pro playbook) and a top you can strip down to. In terms of trends this summer, that could mean an off-the-shoulder T-shirt, a camisole or – for the real club-friendly look, a bra top like those found at Zara and others. There’s a case to be made for heels for your first night out in over two years but trainers are more fashionable. In even better news, the super-comfy chunky ones get a pass, as part of the “dad trainer” trend. A pair of grey New Balance 550s are now classic and robust enough to come through clubbing dirt fairly unscathed.",Arts/Music,Making up for lost time: UK goes ‘out out’ after two-year break,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2022/apr/22/uk-goes-out-club-bars-covid
4/22/2022,"It seems like simple advice for the Earl and Countess of Wessex’s Caribbean tour: avoid taking references from Netflix drama The Crown, ditch anything that smacks of 1950s colonialism and instead try to create a modern monarchy handbook to swerve the PR pitfalls that befell the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s recent controversial visit to the region. But with Grenada dropped from the itinerary with no explanation the day before the tour started on Friday, and an open letter on slave trade reparations awaiting them in Antigua and Barbuda, the spotlight is already on Edward and Sophie’s platinum jubilee tour of Antigua and Barbuda, St Lucia, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. Buckingham Palace will be desperate to avoid the PR missteps suffered by William and Kate, with its unfortunate images of the couple greeting children in Jamaica through wire fencing. If there were ever plans for the Wessexes to recreate the Queen and Prince Philip waving from an open-top Land Rover, as William and Kate did in images criticised as a relic of a past colonial era, they should have been immediately shelved, said PR expert Mark Borkowski. The Land Rover shots of the couple “looked straight out of 1950s. Like somehow they were taking references from The Crown rather than the modern handbook of how to look contemporary and future-thinking and not being anachronistic,” he added. “If they [the royal family] start repeating these errors, there is clearly something at the heart that is broken of what has been a very controlling royal media machine.” But, despite royal aides’ detailed scrutiny of the Wessexes’ itinerary, potential for backlash exists in a region where some island nations have made clear their intentions to sever links with the crown. During their tour of Belize, Jamaica and the Bahamas, the Cambridges faced protests against slavery, calls for reparations and public apologies, and the Jamaican prime minister’s uncomfortable on-camera warning that the country will ditch the monarchy. Now, the Antigua and Barbuda Reparations Support Commission has warned the Wessexes, in an open letter, against the “phoney sanctimony” of “members of the royal family and representatives of the government of Britain” coming to the region to “ lament that slavery was an ‘appalling atrocity’, that it was ‘abhorrent’, that it should not have happened”. “For us, they are the source of genocide and of continuing deep international injury, injustice and racism. We hope you will respect us by not repeating the mantra. We are not simpletons,” it reads. An apology for slavery and reparations are still needed, said the commission chair, Dorbrene O’Marde, who has described William and Kate’s tour as a “horrible, horrible exposition of archaic colonial behaviour”. He told local radio the letter followed concerns raised by others including the absence of “an apology from the crown both as a family and as an institution for their role in the enslavement of African people”. O’Marde has also claimed the last-minute cancellation of the Grenada leg of the Wessexes’ tour was because of recent revelations that the Bank of England owned 599 slaves from Grenada in the late 18th century. Buckingham Palace has not elaborated on the reasons for the postponement. So the Wessexes are “hostages to misfortune,” said Borkowski, and are straitjacketed by traditional protocol. “They are forced to do these things which still have a throwback to a time where the royal family were loved, back in the 50s”. “But it’s 60 years on. A lot of water has passed under the bridge.” The recent royal focus on the Caribbean may be a kind of scoping exercise for a royal family testing where it might be when Charles, then William, ascend the throne, he said. In December, Antigua and Barbuda’s tourism minister, Charles “Max” Fernandez, and an editorial in the Antigua Observer, said it was time to follow Barbados and become a republic. In St Lucia, former prime minister Dr Kenny Anthony has said his government should follow suit. An editorial in the Vincentian newspaper of St Vincent and the Grenadines said Barbados had shown it could be “easily accomplished”. So, it is against this backdrop that the Wessexes arrive. Aides should be checking and rechecking photographers positions, said Borkowski, in light of the Cambridges’ fence pictures. “They usually are very careful. The royal rota for years has been about stopping the unexpected shot from filtering into the mainstream. So it’s a surprise they were caught out.” His advice: “[The Wessexes] should avoid cliches, think very carefully about every photo op and not go off-piste. Don’t extemporise. Keep to the plan, and make sure the plan has been thought through with great military precision.”",News/UK news,Ditch the Land Rover shots: PR advice to Prince Edward and Sophie before Caribbean tour,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/ditch-the-land-rover-shots-pr-advice-to-prince-edward-and-sophie-before-caribbean-tour
4/22/2022,"Kate and Gerry McCann are likely to take limited solace from Portuguese authorities designating a convicted German sex offender a formal suspect in the disappearance of their daughter, more than 14 years after police pointed a finger of suspicion at them. In their case, it took 11 months for the Portuguese police to lift their categorisation of the couple as arguidos – translated from Portuguese as “named suspects” or “formal suspects”. The initial police probe in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann in May 2007 from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz was also shelved at that point. But by then, investigators had already made a string of potentially crucial, basic errors which included not just falsely suspecting the McCanns but also failing to seal off the scene at the family’s Praia da Luz holiday apartment Almost a decade and a half later, and after multiple suspects and desperate public appeals, it was a police search of an allotment in the German city of Hanover, in the summer of 2020 which gave something of a different sense that there had finally been a breakthrough in the trans-national investigation. The excavation had come to an end by July of that year, but a name had already emerged in form of a convicted sex offender, Christian Brückner, who had occupied the ground in the months which followed Madeline’s disappearance. Now, the formal identification by Portuguese authorities of Brückner as an arguido heightens levels of expectations again, even if an abundance of false leads over the years still gives cause for caution. The original Portuguese police investigation had also resulted in an Anglo-Portuguese man, Robert Murat, being taken for questioning and also being made an arguido. . Murat was formally cleared of suspicion in 2008 and won more than £500,000 in libel damages over defamatory articles connecting him with the child’s disappearance. It would be January 2009 before the McCanns returned to Portugal, launching a new public appeal for information. One suspect emerged in the shape of a dying convicted paedophile, Raymond Hewlett, who said he was in the Algarve around the time of the child’s disappearance but insisted he had an alibi. Another was an unnamed woman who private detectives hired by the McCanns said they wanted to speak to and who had reportedly been seen in Barcelona days after the girl’s disappearance. In March 2010, a released file from the Portuguese police on potential sightings was described as “gold dust” by a spokesperson for the family. But it, too, would lead to nothing before efforts were stepped up again the following year when then prime minister, David Cameron, asked Scotland Yard to help the Portuguese authorities with their investigation. The Metropolitan police’s involvement, known as Operation Grange, has continued to this day. It brought with it new “persons of interest” and the identification of new cases where a lone intruder had broken into holiday apartments. Until the shift in focus to Germany in the summer of 2020, what appeared to be the most significant development was the search by British and Portuguese police of a patch of scrubland outside Praia da Luz in June 2014. It ultimately yielded nothing. The 10th anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance came and went in 2017, and four official suspects investigated by Scotland Yard were ruled out of the investigation – though a senior police chief said they were pursuing a “significant line of inquiry”. Against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic, on 4 June, the public identification of German man serving time in prison as a new prime suspect came out of the blue. He was said to have been in the vicinity of the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007, and had a telephone conversation that ended just over an hour before the child went missing from the holiday apartment where she had been sleeping alone with her younger twin siblings as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant. Soon Brückner’s name emerged. And while the development brought hope that the case of the child’s disappearance may one day be solved, the German state prosecutor’s office has said it has “concrete evidence” that Madeleine is dead. Amid the latest developments, prosecutors in the Portuguese city of Faro did not publicly name the man but said in a statement he was identified as a suspect by German authorities at their request. Brückner’s lawyer has that his client has not been charged over the case. However, the potential timing is not lost on those familiar with the case given Portugal’s 15-year statute of limitations for crimes with a maximum prison sentence of 10 years or more..",News/UK news,"False leads, multiple suspects: the long search for Madeleine McCann",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/apr/22/madeleine-mccann-suspects-latest-portugal
4/22/2022,"Scientists have discovered an “unusual” new species of deep-sea jellyfish living in the waters off the California coast. The creature, a type of Atolla jellyfish, was discovered by scientists at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). It lives in the so-called midnight zone of the ocean – between one and four kilometers deep – a mysterious region where light only comes from animals that produce it themselves and the pressure reaches 5,580 pounds a square inch. Years ago, researchers there noticed something strange when looking at video and samples from remotely operated vehicles. While Atolla, a red-colored jelly with one trailing tentacle, is a common inhabitant of the midnight zone of Monterey Bay, there were some jellies that looked different. Instead of one tentacle, this jelly had none. “We realized that we had found an unusual jelly around 2014 and went back through our records to find a few additional observations,” says George Matsumoto, MBARI senior education and research specialist. “We also kept an eye out for additional sightings so that we could obtain specimens to examine and deposit at the California Academy of Sciences.” The researchers collected numerous specimens of three different Atolla-like jellies that lacked the tentacle. They have now created enough details to formally identify one of them, naming it the Atolla reynoldsi in a research paper published last month. The newly described jelly is larger than other Atollas – the largest specimen MBARI researchers collected was 13 centimeters in diameter. It’s also not as common as other types of Atolla – researchers have only observed 10 specimens between April 2006 and June 2021. The species is only known from Monterey Bay and lives at depths of 1,013 to 3,189 meters. Matsumoto and his coauthors believe two more previously unknown species of Atolla also live in the depths of Monterey Bay, California – alongside the ten types of Atolla that are already known around the world. They hope to use DNA to eventually describe these new additions to Atolla’s family tree. “We have seen even fewer of these than our recent new species so we need to wait to find some more samples before we can definitely say that they are also new species,” he says. “We hope that by publishing images and videos that our colleagues around the world will keep their eyes open for these undescribed types.” The existence of this jelly raises questions about species that live in the global ocean and haven’t yet been described. Millions of species live in the deep-sea – and many are still unknown. Noaa estimates that humans have only described 10% of what can be found in the ocean. It also takes time to publish the findings. According to a study from 2012, the average time between the discovery of a new species and its “description” – eg the process of formally describing a newly identified species to the scientific community – is 21 years. MBARI researchers have documented more than 225 new species from explorations in Monterey Bay over the past 34 years – but the deep zone is one of the least explored places. The finding also comes as marine environments such as the Monterey Bay face increasing pressures from climate change and pollution. A 2019 study of the bay found high concentrations of microplastics even at great depths. “We, collectively the human population, need to spend more time and funds exploring and learning about the ocean – the largest habitat on Earth,” says Matsumoto. “It is difficult to protect or preserve an ecosystem when we don’t know who lives in that system or how they interact with each other – and humans are already having an impact on the ocean.”",News/Environment,‘Unusual’ deep-sea jellyfish discovered off California coast,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/22/unusual-jellyfish-discovered-california-atolla-reynoldsi
4/22/2022,"A senior Russian military commander has said that the goal of Russia’s new offensive is to seize control of southern Ukraine and form a land bridge to Crimea, indicating that Russia plans a permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory taken in the war. Rustam Minnekayev, acting commander of the central military district, also told members of a defence industry forum on Friday that control over southern Ukraine would give Russia access to Transnistria, a pro-Russian breakaway region of Moldova, indicating that Russia may attack the port city of Odesa and consider military action in Moldova. The remarks directly contradict earlier claims from Vladimir Putin that Russia was not planning to occupy Ukrainian cities permanently and suggests the Kremlin is changing tack after its failed offensive toward Kyiv, which appeared to seek regime change. The statement was the first by a high-ranking official about the Russian military’s goals to occupy territory as it manoeuvres for an anticipated “battle for Donbas” in Ukraine’s east. “Since the beginning of the second phase of the special operation … one of the tasks of the Russian army is to establish full control over Donbas and southern Ukraine. This will provide a land corridor to Crimea, as well as affecting vital objects of the Ukrainian economy, Black Sea ports through which agricultural and metallurgical products are supplied to [other] countries,” Minnekayev said on Friday at the annual meeting of the Union of Defence Industry Enterprises of Russia’s Sverdlovsk region. Crimea was annexed by Russia in 2014, a move not recognised by the international community. Russia’s campaign in southern Ukraine has been more successful than its attempts to take Kyiv from the north, although it has also met fierce resistance from Ukrainian troops. Russia has occupied the city of Kherson and has claimed near-total control of Mariupol, as it plans a pincer-style attack on Ukrainian forces in the eastern Donbas region. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of planning to “falsify” an independence referendum in the partly occupied southern regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, telling Ukrainians there not to give personal information to occupying forces. Russia was planning “to falsify a so-called referendum on your land, if an order comes from Moscow to stage such a show. And this is the reality. Be careful.” The Kremlin refused to answer questions about Minnekayev’s comments on Friday, saying the Russian defence ministry was responsible for the “special operation”, meaning Russia’s war in Ukraine. It is not clear if Minnekayev was revealing details about Russia’s formal plans for its offensive or expressing his personal views on the benefits of Russia’s military offensive. Minnekayev, the acting commander of one of Russia’s four military districts, also said that “control over southern Ukraine will give yet another point of access to Transnistria, where facts of oppression of the Russian-speaking population have also been observed.” “Apparently, we are now at war with the whole world,” Minnekayev said. If true, that could indicate Russia would seek to take Odesa, one of Ukraine’s largest cities, and seek to reinforce its positions in Transnistria, a Russian-controlled territory of Moldova that has hosted Russian troops since the fall of the Soviet Union. With Russian backing, Transnistria fought a war against Moldova in the 1990s that left the territory with de facto independence and a garrison of 1,500 Russian troops. The region is recognised as part of Moldova. The unrecognised state is strongly influenced internationally by nostalgia for the Soviet Union and its affinity for Russia, which is fostered by state propaganda. It is unlikely that Russian forces, which have sustained considerable losses in the early stages of the war, would be able to stage an offensive toward Odesa at the moment, much less the border with Moldova. Russian warships have been driven further from Ukraine’s coast after the Moskva cruiser, a Russian flagship, sank in the Black Sea last week. Ukraine claimed it had attacked the cruiser with anti-ship missiles.",News/World news,Russian military chief suggests permanent occupation of southern Ukraine planned,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/22/ukraine-south-occupation-russian-military-chief-rustam-minnekayev
4/22/2022,"Tessa Lidstone remembers the last meals she cooked before she had to close her Bristol restaurant Box-E for the first lockdown. It was 14 March 2020, and the restaurant was rammed. The venue is tiny: just 14 tables in two repurposed shipping containers. “It felt like a scary time,” says the 40-year-old. “Everything was slipping away and beyond our control.” With the restaurant closed for the foreseeable, Lidstone got to thinking about how other people might be coping. “I felt isolated in the pandemic,” she says, “but I was so lucky: I had my husband and kids with me. I thought about all the people without a support network and how awful it must be to not have contact with anyone.” Lidstone saw a callout from a collective of Bristol restaurants called the Bristol Food Union. They were looking for volunteers to help put together boxes of emergency food for young care leavers who would be isolated during those initial days of the pandemic. “I thought, I’d love doing that,’” says Lidstone. “It was originally going to be for two weeks. But it just grew from there.” In her first week, Lidstone put together boxes for 100 young care leavers: pasta, bread and milk, but also fruit and veg, and the odd sweet treat. By the second week, she was coordinating packages for 250 people. The council provided funding, but Lidstone had to source and order the food. Most suppliers were more than willing to help. “They were so generous,” she says. “If I ordered milk, bread and butter, they’d donate fruit and vegetables as well. It meant I could make the money go further.” She was keen to include more than the basics. “I don’t want to use the word ‘luxury’,” she says, “Things like cheese shouldn’t be a luxury. I wanted the food to be interesting.” Lidstone put her restaurant training to good use, creating a weekly recipe card to go in each box. She also videoed herself making the meal and posted it online. “It was basic home cooking,” she says. “Lentil bolognese, macaroni cheese, fajitas.” By week three, Lidstone was thinking bigger: “I asked the council if there were any birthdays coming up and we’d arrange something extra for the young person.” And she heard from the volunteers who delivered the boxes that young parents were always in need of nappies. “I got mountains of nappies and baby food,” she says, “so we could offer a more appropriate box of essentials. “One young woman asked for some toddler plates, forks and spoons,” she says. “It really touched me: given everything that was going on in the world, she was trying to create an environment for her child that she hadn’t necessarily had herself growing up.” Nick Matthews, who works for Total Produce, one of Lidstone’s suppliers, helped drop off her packages. “You could see how much it meant to people,” he says, “to realise someone was thinking of them in a hard time like that.” By then, the scale of Lidstone’s operation had become a bit overwhelming. “The first few weeks I packed everything on my own,” she says. “You think you can pack 100 boxes just like that. But there were so many elements. It took ages.” Staff from the restaurant, and Lidstone’s children, helped out. In all, Lidstone and her team delivered 2,500 boxes over 16 weeks. She makes light of this. “It’s easy to feel overwhelmed by a situation,” she says, “and think you can’t do anything. But there are small things we can all do, and they make a difference.” When Box-E reopened in September 2020, Lidstone hired a care leaver as a paid apprentice. He’d wanted to get into the industry and had some cooking experience. “It has been lovely having him in the kitchen and seeing him grow as part of the team,” she says. When I ask Lidstone what she’d like as a treat, her thoughts go immediately to her daughters – Lois, 9, and Rita, 6 – who packed boxes for her week after week at Bristol City football club after the operation outgrew Lidstone’s house. Between packing stints, the girls would ride their bikes around the ground, making obstacle courses out of empty boxes. “Rita learned to ride properly there,” says Lidstone. But she has outgrown her bike, and is using her big sister’s which means Lois is bike-less. Lidstone tentatively suggests a new bike for Lois, so they can go on family rides again. Bike Club supplies a bright red Forme cycle. Lidstone keeps it secret, so it is a surprise for Lois. “She came in, saw the box and was so excited,” says Lidstone. “She loves it.” They plan to go cycling this weekend as a family, for the first time since the pandemic. “We just need to put the pedals on!” Lidstone laughs.

4/22/2022,"Of late I’ve been intensifying the frequency with which I bump people’s fists. Bit of unexpected banter in the street? Fist bump. Saying goodbye to a friend from an awkward distance that would necessitate fist bumping on one leg? Fist bump. Holding up the end of a five-a-side match so I can fist bump every last person on the pitch? Fist bump. I love fist bumping so much, but I do so with the passion of the convert. Once, I was a handshaker. Family got a hug, and maybe close friends after a few drinks, but everyone else got what is described in Business Etiquette for Dummies as the “perfect” handshake: “A firm [connection] with good eye contact [which] communicates self-confidence.” Then came Covid. One of my vivid memories of the spring of 2020 was watching Premier League footballers practising elbow bumps as a greeting, laughing at the ridiculousness of a measure recommended to limit the spread of a new virus. A week later the grounds were shut down. Twelve months further on and even that kind of limited physical contact had largely been removed from our lives. Then, with the easing of restrictions, I began to value as I never had before the moments when you could reach out and touch somebody else. Obviously, shaking hands was out: too risky. And elbows were still too awkward. But fist bumps were quick and clean. Barack Obama was the great populariser of the fist bump. On accepting the Democratic nomination for president in Minnesota in 2008, he took to the stage and exchanged a gentle, cocked-wrist bump with his wife, Michelle. It became a talking point – it “thrilled a lot of black folks”, according to Ta-Nehisi Coates, and was likely to have been an al-Qaida “terrorist fist jab” in the eyes of Fox News – but it also cut through to the public at large. This was surely because of its tenderness. According to Obama afterwards, the gesture “captured what I love about my wife – there’s an irreverence about her … and sometimes we’ll do silly things”. A presidential couple doing something both affectionate and silly moved the fist bump from a gesture largely associated with sport to something more commonplace. In the interests of balance, it should probably be acknowledged that the handshake has not always been the act of formalised self-assertion it is today. Its early history (handshakes feature in the Iliad) was as a means of building trust, as it allowed someone to check you weren’t concealing a weapon. In the 17th century, the Quakers appropriated the gesture as something almost equivalent to a fist bump today: an act of openness that welcomed one’s fellow man and eschewed the hierarchical behaviours involved in bowing or tipping your hat. As I bumped my way through 2021, I rode on Obama vibes. Gently meeting another person’s knuckles was, it became clear, a very different kind of greeting. It’s something about the simplicity and the way in which the hands meet evenly. There’s little opportunity for power games with a fist bump, and no need to stand up straight. There’s nothing about this gesture that has anything to do with displaying self-confidence. During a period that was battering for everyone, the fist bump felt appropriate; and, what’s more, it was easy to do. Bumping someone who has helped you out or done something thoughtful just wasn’t as awkward as offering to shake hands. It was a way to show gratitude. It also felt like a means of simply acknowledging common humanity. That was then. Now the pandemic restrictions are so totally over in England, I can already sense an awkwardness as I try to connect my fist with another’s. The handshake is creeping back. I am one of those people who worry that the disaster this country went through in the past two years, and the collective trauma we all shared, are things that may easily be buried. I fear that we won’t take the time to reflect on what happened and retain those things we learned for the better from that period. A greater ability to acknowledge what people have in common was, I believe, one of those things. Which is why – at least for now – my quest for bumping continues.

4/22/2022,"For a long time, it was an accepted truth that video games just didn’t work on screen. Remember the quasi-cyberpunk 1993 Super Mario movie, starring Dennis Hopper? It was so bad that basically everyone involved with it has disavowed it. And TV? Kids of the 90s will remember the incredibly annoying voice of Sonic the Hedgehog on Saturday morning TV – or the permanent repeats of the Pokémon anime series – but other than that, the entertainment world never took games seriously. Now, though, things are different. In the past few years, Hollywood has managed to produce a few video-game films that are actually watchable, such as Detective Pikachu and Sonic the Hedgehog 2. And barely a week goes by without an announcement that another game has been picked up for TV – all of which are aimed at adults, not kids or tweens. There’s a science fiction series based on Halo, the first-person shooter from 2001 whose original fans are well into their 30s and beyond. There’s a Netflix adaptation of Assassin’s Creed, the historical action game that makes you run around in elaborate simulations of ancient Egypt or Renaissance Italy – which adds to the streaming giant’s 15-rated take on The Witcher, starring Henry Cavill, which is almost as filthy and violent as its source material. And in an Inception-level example of games and TV inspiring each other, there’s even a series based on Cuphead, a well-loved but niche run-and-gun game that is itself a homage to early 1920s cartoons. What has changed? Why is the TV world suddenly so interested in shows based on games? And this time, will they be any good? The simplest explanation for the boom of game adaptations is, predictably, money. Video games are bigger business than ever before – the games industry was worth $175bn in 2021 (for context, the entire global movie industry is worth $100bn). The audience who play them have also grown up since the Pokémon heyday; 80% of US video game players are over 18 and more than half of them – 52% – are between 18 and 45, the “key demographic” TV executives love most. “Video games have evolved from a fringe activity to mainstream entertainment, and Netflix is looking to retain and acquire subscribers by plugging into what’s popular with younger audiences,” says longstanding games industry researcher Joost van Dreunen. “As streaming services compete over content, they look for categories to give them an edge. So HBO and Amazon Prime have been developing game-based series … When done properly and taken seriously, these adaptations can serve everyone, including the audience.” That last point is crucial: audiences (and critics) can smell it a mile off when a show is a cynical cash-in. Helpfully, the first generations that grew up with games are now in their 40s and 50s and have aged into power: speaking to people in the TV and games industries, it is clear the writers and directors of these new shows are people who actually play games, and genuinely love the source material – such as Supernatural showrunner Andrew Dabb, who is heading up the Netflix Resident Evil series that premieres in July, and says it’s his “favourite game of all time”. They appreciate video games in all their empowering, exciting and often unintentionally hilarious weirdness. There ’s a much better chance they’ll make TV worth watching. Nonetheless, when a game gets picked up for TV, the original creative team are often not involved. So the people who spent years creating the game itself – on big-budget projects, the narrative team alone can comprise 10 or 20 people – are usually left sitting nervously on the sidelines. That can be a nerve-wracking experience, especially given the track record. Bruce Straley was the co-creator of Naughty Dog’s hard-hitting, critically acclaimed post-apocalyptic game The Last of Us, the tale of a teenage girl called Ellie and her reluctant father figure Joel on a journey across the devastated remnants of America. When The Last of Us was picked up by HBO in 2020, he had mixed feelings. “Years ago, we used to think that to have a movie made about a game we worked on was ‘making it’. I don’t think that any more,” he says. “Our industry has proven its value and doesn’t need other mediums to validate us … I don’t have a problem with adaptations. But in my – and I think all of our – experience, something always falls short with the execution … I know very little about the production, but it’s hard for me to fully endorse it.” This is partly due to the difference between writing for games and for TV. “With The Last of Us, I wanted the player to feel the same feelings Joel and Ellie might be feeling at any given moment,” says Straley. “That meant the player had to be 100% there throughout their journey, participating in all the ups and downs, turns and surprises of their survival, and their joys. I believed that taking as much story out of cutscenes [non-interactive sequences] and creating playable scenes instead enabled us to create a significantly more impactful experience than I ever could in a TV show or film. So we have to ask, what makes a game great? And will an adaptation add to the core experience or diminish it?” The gulf between writing for a linear medium such as TV and an interactive one like games is at the heart of what makes these adaptations so difficult. “With film and TV, every single moment is precious. If something is not in service to the greater narrative, it’s gonna get cut,” says Sam Winkler, a senior writer at Gearbox Entertainment, creators of the Borderlands series – most recently Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, a madcap Dungeons and Dragons-inspired adventure through the mind of a cheerful teen psychopath. “In games there’s so much more breathing room, and I think that’s why the comedy has such a different flavour. In Borderlands we have to be ready for the player to do some weird thing in the middle of the main story, we have to be ready for a joke to pop off at any time, and it has to read well in any situation.” As a result, the best adaptations are often ones that focus on channelling the atmosphere of the original game, rather than obsessing over their plot. “The ones that people have responded well to, like the Castlevania TV series, take the setting and characters and try to give viewers the feeling players had the first time they played these games, without sticking rock-solid to the story,” says Winkler. “That’s the biggest mistake anyone makes – and I’m honestly surprised that people keep making it – it’s kind of wild. Of course, it all depends on how something gets greenlit: is it a passion project from someone who played the games and wants to bring it to life? Or an executive noticing that games are making more money than movies saying we gotta get a piece of that? It’s sad when a project is a cash grab. You can always tell when the people behind a project care and understand the source material.” This guarded scepticism is repeated by most people in the games industry when we talk about adaptations – and it’s not unwarranted. Game developers, long patronised by the rest of the entertainment industry, wonder what motivation the TV world has to do their stories justice. I hear several stories of painful, tone-deaf pitches from production companies with no idea what a studio’s games were about. “One outfit put together a teaser for a proposed adaptation of The Last of Us that was this on-the-nose, B-movie, slasher/horror film,” says Straley. “It was so beyond their conception that a post-apocalyptic game could generate genuine emotions.” Admittedly, games have not always had the kind of stories or characters that provoke reflection or empathy (has anyone ever thought much about the motivations of Doom’s demon-killing supersoldier?). But these days they do – another reason, perhaps, that the TV world is showing more interest. The challenge now for people making shows based on games is not to wring a good script out of paper-thin plots; it’s to honour the genuine emotional connection players feel when they’re in a character’s shoes, with a gamepad in their hands. “The awesomest thing and the hardest thing about games is the interactivity,” says Straley. “It’s so powerful to be able to pull the player into a world and let them craft an experience of their own. I truly believe that there’s a different mental wiring, and a different connection, than when we sit in front of a TV. With this power comes a ton of problems for developers. It’s one of the hardest mediums to work in, if you care about telling a quality story, and if you really think about what it takes to make a good story in a game, it’s pretty baffling that it ever works! But when it does, it’s pure magic. “We have to ask ourselves: what’s the purpose of a game-to-screen adaptation? I don’t want the lesser version of the game experience – I want something that introduces new fans to what makes that game great.” Resident Evil is on Netflix on 14 July; Halo will be on Paramount+ in the summer",Arts/Television & radio,Shoot em up!

4/22/2022,"The moment my gynaecologist uttered the word “vaginismus”, my heart sank in disbelief. I had spent the previous few months going from doctor to doctor to try to understand why I was suffering severe pain during penetrative sex. As a young, sexually liberated woman, it had never crossed my mind that a spontaneous tightening of my vagina could be the source of my pain. I was relieved I finally had a diagnosis, but my partner and I had previously enjoyed our sex life, and I couldn’t help but worry this diagnosis would sound its death knell. Vaginismus can be caused by trauma, either physical mental, or, as in my case, it can occur for no obvious reason at all. It causes the vagina to suddenly tighten when something is inserted inside it, and its symptoms can be debilitating, causing burning, stinging and pain that can severely affect a sufferer’s mental health. Treatment can include psychosexual therapy, relaxation techniques and pelvic floor exercises. In my case, I was referred for physiotherapy and taught how to use dilators to slowly stretch out my muscles in a bid to become comfortable with penetration again. But while I focused on treating the physical cause of my pain, I hadn’t noticed that my confidence and identity as a sexual being had been obliterated. I was riddled with anxiety at the thought of intimacy and lost all sense of my sexuality. Even just a kiss would cause me to panic. But driven by fear, I persevered – more often than not unsuccessfully. Attempts at intercourse would end with me spluttering through tears, “There’s something wrong with me.” No matter how reassuring my partner was, I couldn’t help but feel I had lost my sex life, and a part of me with it. It took me time to come to terms with the diagnosis, but once I did, my attitude slowly started to shift. Delving into sex-positive resources helped me redefine what sex could look like and I found a creativity in my pursuit of pleasure that hadn’t been there before. Whenever I could have painless penetrative sex, I would, but if that wasn’t possible, I lent on other things. My partner and I experimented with mutual masturbation, erotic films, sex toys and other ways of giving and receiving pleasure to get our sex life back on track. I invested in lingerie that made me feel confident – and not just for the bedroom, but to be worn every day as a reminder to myself that I was sexy. I discovered the joy of using lubricant, and learned more about my own pleasure than ever before. The payoff has been dramatic. My orgasms have never been more intense, but my most important awakening has been realising that sex doesn’t have to mean penetration, something I now see was a decidedly heteronormative and patriarchal view of pleasure. My unlearning of these deeply ingrained beliefs about what sex should look like has – put simply – helped me become better at it. And its impact on my relationship has been palpable. When I first started feeling pain, I worried about the strain a difficult sex life would put on our relationship. But our innovation in the bedroom, through challenging circumstances, along with my partner’s compassion and patience, has brought us even closer together. It’s taught me that mind-blowing sex, the stuff we all dream of, can only be achieved with absolute trust and consent. The times when I slip back into old habits and try to “push through” the pain, my partner stops me. He has never made me feel guilty or put pressure on me to carry on, and this in turn has paved the way for more honest conversations about what feels pleasurable. Ultimately, being diagnosed with vaginismus has been hard. No one wants to experience painful sex, and I’m relieved that my condition has improved with treatment. But as I reflect, many of my initial fears following the diagnosis have proved to be unfounded. Patience, honesty and creativity have helped make my sex life the most exciting it has ever been.
