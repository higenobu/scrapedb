2/20/2022,"Deaths linked to prescription anti-anxiety drugs such as Valium are at the highest level for a decade, driven partly by the increasing popularity of illegal stimulants such as cocaine. Analysis of government data reveals that benzodiazepines – sedatives used for treating anxiety and insomnia – were mentioned on the death certificates of 476 people in England and Wales last year, a 55% increase in 10 years.  Experts from social care organisation Turning Point believe that drug dealers are increasingly offering “street Valium” to counteract the effects of stimulants such as mephedrone (Mcat) and cocaine. Cocaine’s popularity continues to grow in the UK, with the latest data indicating unprecedented availability and a street purity that is higher than ever. Analysis of NHS and government statistics by Turning Point found that deaths linked to diazepam – first marketed as Valium – rose the highest among all benzodiazepine-type drugs in the last decade, from 186 to 304, an increase of 63%. Known as “benzos”, the psychoactive substances help calm brain activity and are used to treat fits, along with other conditions, but are highly addictive, although no comprehensive figures are available to estimate the numbers of people addicted. Turning Point, which supports people with substance misuse issues, said urgent action was required to prevent further tragedies and improve support for those dependent on the drug. David Bremner, the charity’s medical director, said: “The increase in deaths across the country is a concerning trend – each one is a tragedy.” Experts believe that cuts in funding for substance misuse support services and increased pressure on primary care are among other explanations for the rise in deaths. “Cutbacks to addiction support services and increased pressures on GPs are among factors that are likely to blame for this rise,” said Bremner. He added: “Sustained investment in treatment services is key if the government is to address this public health crisis.” The data shows that every region in England – apart from the south-west and east – has seen a rise in deaths among people prescribed or using benzodiazepines. The highest figure overall was 78 deaths in 2020 for both the north-east and north-west, compared to 53 and 49 respectively in 2010. This is despite the fact prescriptions for benzodiazepines in England have fallen overall from 11.3m in 2010 to 8.6m in 2020 following warnings about the high risk of dependency.

2/20/2022,"Economic change is speeding up. Technology means that industries are shrinking and growing faster than ever. The young change jobs incessantly while firms fire at will, ending the “job for life” enjoyed by previous generations. Everyone moves around the country for work these days, vacating poorer parts of Britain and hollowing out communities. All of these statements are almost universally accepted as truths about 21st-century Britain. They guide what policymakers see as the important questions to be asked and the right answers to give. However, all of them are wrong, in many cases wildly so. In most senses, change has been flat or is actually slowing down.  A safe option for anyone needing to sell an economics book for the past decade is to put a robot on the cover and warn that machines are taking our jobs and whole sectors are set to be wiped out – from taxi drivers to lawyers. History shows us that big structural changes do happen. There were 7.7m manufacturing jobs in 1970 and there are only 2.5m today. The share of jobs in professional services, education and health has doubled over the same period. However, this kind of economic change, where the workforce shifts from one industry to another, has been slowing since the 1980s. In the 2010s, it was running at just one-third of the pace seen 30 years earlier because Britain’s de-industrialisation is broadly complete. More recent trends, such as the decline of retail jobs and growth in the care sector, are minor in comparison and industrial change is actually at its lowest rate for a century. Economy-wide trends can hide what happens to individuals, but there too the evidence points in the opposite direction to popular narratives. A job-hopping epidemic is something managers moan about rather than a thing that actually happens. In 1993, the average time that workers had been in their post was 60 months. Almost three decades later, it’s still 60 months. Nostalgia is a dangerous guide to just about anything – there never was a job for life. The UK has a flexible labour market, where it’s easy for workers to move or firms to hire and fire. But that doesn’t mean lots of moving or firing is going on. The rates at which people change jobs is actually down by a full quarter this century with only 2.4% of us moving during the three months prior to the pandemic. The fall is particularly large for those workers held to be most likely to move: the young. We have seen a growth in less secure work, from zero-hours contracts to self-employment, but firms are much less likely to fire these days. In the late 1990s, 0.8% of workers would lose their jobs each quarter; immediately pre-pandemic that had halved. Modern business has nothing in common with The Apprentice. More young adults in university means more moving away from home for education. However, when it comes to young people moving around the country for work, that is now less common, down a third from the late 1990s to the late 2010s. More broadly, odd ideas about exactly who moves around the country are widespread. Take discussions of the so-called red wall seats that the Conservatives won at the last general election. You’d think from how people talk about the likes of Bolton and Ashfield that these constituencies have seen a youth exodus but their defining feature is that far fewer young people leave them than depart other, richer, Conservative seats – and for that matter, far fewer people are moving in. This huge gap between rhetoric and reality on economic change matters. It focuses our attention on the wrong problems and drives us to the wrong answers, taking our politics down rabbit holes that do nothing to help us build a better Britain. Worries about too much change distract us from the real disaster of the past decade: our pay and productivity levels have not changed nearly enough. Before the financial crisis, productivity grew at roughly 2% a year. Since then, it has averaged only 0.4%, resulting in our wages having only just recovered to their pre-financial crisis level when Covid turned up. Those making fewer job moves, particular younger workers, have missed out on significant pay rises: individuals who moved job typically enjoy five times the pay rise of workers staying put. The young aren’t too footloose and fancy free - they’re dangerously stuck in the mud. Far from all change is good, of course. The decline in job losses means fewer people now see the downgrades and falls in pay that often follow. Instead of panicking about jobs being destroyed, we should focus on the fact that different groups face very different risks: lower-paid workers are six times more likely than managers to lose work. They are the ones under threat from the Cameron-era decision to give workers protection from unfair dismissal after only two years in post. Recognition that workers are now less likely to move for a new job has important lessons for us that are obscured by misplaced panic about everyone moving around the country. This is happening for a mixture of good (there are now far fewer places where people have to leave if they want to find work), bad (housing costs rise faster in higher wage areas and put better paid jobs out of reach for many) and important reasons, such as wanting to remain near family, that policy must reinforce, tackle and understand respectively. Finally, understanding that our recent past has not involved significant economic change should warn us that we may not be well prepared if that rate of change speeds up. Pent-up desire for change during the pandemic has pushed job moves temporarily to record highs, while the lasting consequences of the home-working surge remain to be seen. The aftermath of Covid-19 and the rate at which our population is ageing could combine with Brexit and the net-zero transition to reshape our economy over the decade ahead. If they do, it’ll be a shock to Britain’s workers, companies and the state. Our benefits system without its furlough bolt-on does little to insure us against change, while corporate Britain has a weak record on investing when new opportunities and challenges emerge. Watching Apollo 11’s 1969 triumph in taking humans to the moon was a formative experience for my dad. Whenever he’s told technological change has accelerated, he notes that it’s taken us another 50 years for Amazon to get William Shatner into space. He has a point, which is as true for economic change here on Earth as it is for travel to the stars.  Torsten Bell is chief executive of the Resolution Foundation.

2/20/2022,"Facebook is under renewed scrutiny this weekend, accused of continuing to allow activists to incite ethnic massacres in Ethiopia’s escalating war. Analysis by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) and the Observer found Facebook is still letting users post content inciting violence through hate and misinformation. This is despite being aware it helps directly fuel tensions, prompting claims of inaction and indifference against the social media giant.  The investigation tracked down relatives who have linked Facebook posts to the killings of loved ones. One senior member of Ethiopia’s media accused the firm of “standing by and watching the country fall apart”. The accusations arrive amid intensifying focus on Facebook’s content moderation decisions, with it previously being accused of playing a role in the ethnic persecution of the Rohingya in Myanmar. On Wednesday, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg revealed that former UK deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, would be president of global affairs, a move designed to help the rebranded company repair its reputation following the testimony of whistleblower Frances Haugen, who said it was “literally fanning ethnic violence” in Ethiopia. It also comes as Facebook considers launching an independent inquiry into its work in Ethiopia after its oversight board urged it to investigate how the platform had been used to spread hate speech. TBIJ and Observer investigators also interviewed a number of fact-checkers, civil society organisations and human rights activists in the country. They described Facebook’s support as far less than it should be. Others said they felt requests for assistance had been ignored and meetings failed to materialise. These failures, they said, helped to fuel a conflict in which thousands have died and millions been displaced since fighting broke out between government forces and armed opposition groups from the Tigray region in November 2020. Both sides have been accused of atrocities. Rehobot Ayalew, of the Ethiopian factchecking initiative HaqCheck, said: “Most of the people have low media literacy, so Facebook is considered to be credible. We come across [Facebook] images that are horrifying and hateful content. You’re not getting the support from the platform itself, that is allowing this kind of content. They can do more [but] they’re not doing anything.” Meta rejected the claims, saying it had “invested in safety and security measures” to tackle hate and inflammatory language along with “aggressive steps to stop the spread of misinformation” in Ethiopia. Among the cases where families believe Facebook’s continued promotion of hate makes it responsible for killings include Gebremichael Teweldmedhin, a Tigrayan jeweller abducted three months ago in Gonder, a city in the Amhara region. A relative, who said Teweldmedhin was not political, claimed online hate campaigns and calls for violence – particularly on Facebook – played a key role in his suspected killing and many others. “The worst thing that contributed to their killing are the so-called activists who have been spreading hate on social media,” he said, requesting anonymity. Some posts, he claimed, would name individuals or even post photos helping create an atmosphere “inciting attacks, killings and displacements”. He added that the family have been told that Teweldmedhin – who disappeared after trying to stop a mob looting a nephew’s workshop – had been killed and buried in a mass grave. Teweldmedhin’s family cited one Facebook user in particular: Solomon Bogale, an online activist with more than 86,000 Facebook followers. Although listed on Facebook as residing in London, Bogale’s social media indicates he has been in Ethiopia since August 2021, with posts of him carrying an assault rifle often accompanied by statements praising the Fano, an Amharan nationalist vigilante group. One of Teweldmedhin’s family members believed Bogale’s “inciteful posts” had resulted in many attacks on Tigrayans in Gonder. In the weeks before Teweldmedhin’s killing, Bogale called for people to “cleanse” the Amhara territories of the “junta”, a term used by government supporters to refer to Tigrayan forces and Tigrayans more generally. The post continued: “We need to cleanse the region of the junta lineage present prior to the war!!” According to TBIJ, the post could be found on Facebook almost four months later, although Meta said it had since “removed any content which violated our policies”. When contacted over Facebook, Bogale denied that any Tigrayans were killed in Gonder in early November, saying all Tigrayans in the city were safe. Bogale added that he would delete the posts cited by TBIJ. Less than a month after Teweldmedhin’s disappearance Hadush Gebrekirstos, a 45-year-old who lived in Addis Ababa, was arbitrarily detained by police who heard him speaking Tigrinya. His body was found two days later, 26 November, close to the police station. A relative said Gebrekirstos had no political affiliation, but believes that disinformation posted on Facebook played a key role in causing the killing. “People do not have the ability to verify what was posted on Facebook. Like calling people to kill Tigrinya speaking residents,” they said. Compounding the concern is that, according to disclosures provided to the US Congress by Haugen, Meta has known about the risks of such problems for years. In January 2019 an internal report into “On-FB Badness” – a measure of harmful content on the platform – rated the situation in Ethiopia as “severe”, its second-highest category. Almost a year later Ethiopia had risen to the top of Facebook’s list of countries where it needed to take action. A presentation dated 10 December 2020 evaluated the risk of societal violence in Ethiopia as “dire” – Meta’s highest threat warning and the only country to receive that ranking. More than a year on, it is alleged the firm has frequently ignored requests for support from fact-checkers based in the country. Some civil society organisations say they have not met with the company in 18 months. Multiple sources told the Bureau that Facebook only appointed its first senior policy executive from Ethiopia to work on East Africa in September. Meta does run a third-party fact-checking programme, providing partners with access to internal tools and payment for fact checks. Yet it has not partnered with a single organisation in Ethiopia to tackle the misinformation surrounding the country’s conflict. Abel Wabella, founder of HaqCheck, said Meta had failed to support his organisation despite first approaching executives more than a year ago. The other major independent fact-checking organisation based in Ethiopia, Ethiopia Check, is also not part of Facebook’s partner programme. Instead, Facebook works with two fact-checking organisations on content from Ethiopia – PesaCheck, which runs a small team in Nairobi, and Agence France-Presse (AFP) – but both are based outside the country. Although misinformation flagged by PesaCheck and AFP has often been labelled as false or removed by Facebook, content debunked by HaqCheck has largely remained unaltered and free to spread. This has included false declarations of military victories on both sides, false allegations of attacks on civilians and false claims of captured infiltrators. “As far as I know, support for fact checkers in Ethiopia by Facebook is almost non-existent,” said the senior person working in Ethiopian media, requesting anonymity. “Facebook doesn’t pay the attention Ethiopia needs at this crucial moment, and that’s contributing to the ongoing crisis by inflaming hatred and spreading hate speech.” A number of civil society groups have similar complaints of feeling ignored and sidelined. Facebook organised a meeting with several groups in June 2020, to discuss how the platform could best regulate content before scheduled elections. As of November, two of the organisations involved said they had heard nothing about any subsequent meetings. Haben Fecadu, a human rights activist who has worked in Ethiopia, said: “There’s really no excuse. I’ve doubted they have invested enough in their Africa content moderation.” Mercy Ndegwa, Meta’s public policy director for East & Horn of Africa, said: “For more than two years, we’ve invested in safety and security measures in Ethiopia, adding more staff with local expertise and building our capacity to catch hateful and inflammatory content in the most widely spoken languages, including Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Tigrinya. “As the situation has escalated, we’ve put additional measures in place and are continuing to monitor activity on our platform, identify issues as they emerge, and quickly remove content that breaks our rules.” The company added that it worked with 80 fact-checking partners in more than 60 languages to review content on Facebook, including Pesa Check and AFP.

2/20/2022,"As the new Lord of the Rings series gears up for its September launch on Amazon, the company finds itself navigating treacherous, if familiar, waters and has already triggered a fierce debate over race by introducing characters of color into JRR Tolkien’s fantasy world. The tech giant has spent a dragon’s dungeon of gold on adapting the beloved story famous for its cultish fans, some of whom are deeply enmeshed in the rightwing culture war industry. Yet it is fully aware its final product has to reach a broad and modern audience to justify its eye-popping expenditure.  Co-produced by New Line Cinema, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power isn’t part of Peter Jackson’s phenomenally successful Lord of the Rings and Hobbit movies, but it is intended to capitalize on their success: a streaming series set in the world of Tolkien’s high-fantasy novels, with characters and battles drawn from the interior history and mythology laid forth in the books’ extensive appendices. Jackson himself is not involved but the sets and costumes would be right at home in his movies. The new series will feature the Saint Maud star Morfydd Clark as a younger version of Cate Blanchett’s Elvish queen Galadriel, Benjamin Walker as heroic Elven-King Gil-Galad and Maxim Baldry as human king-to-be Isildur among many others. It cost $465m to make the first season, making it the most expensive television show in history. Over its projected five seasons, that budget will almost certainly exceed $1bn. It is the crown jewel in Amazon’s increasing investment in licensing and producing movies and TV series, which went up from $11bn to $13bn last year according to the company’s annual report. In general, licensing old TV shows and movies will only get more expensive. So it’s in Amazon’s interest to make new shows and movies to attract subscribers and earn itself a little breathing room when it comes time to renegotiate the price of Parks & Recreation reruns. The Lord of the Rings appendices are more of a “show bible” – the kind of notes you’d give to teleplay writers – than a narrative of their own. So producers have woven their own stories of romance and palace intrigue into the book’s timelines, fairy stories and genealogical footnotes. That has allowed them to cast people of color as some of the series’ elves and dwarves, pleasing some of the books’ fans and angering others. Recently, Vanity Fair ran a spread of promotional photos for the show, including images of Sophia Nomvete as Dwarven princess Disa and Ismael Cruz Córdova as Elvish warrior Arondir. On YouTube, the trailer for The Rings of Power has 67,000 comments as of this writing, and thousands of them are the same quote from Tolkien about the corrupting and uncreative nature of evil. “Evil cannot create anything new, it can only spoil and destroy what good forces have invented and created,” it reads in multiple languages. Others were more blunt. “Imagine spending millions of dollars to promote your woke social justice warrior garbage of a film. Way to tarnish a good franchise,” read one. “Amazon decided to destroy Tolkien’s work. Because why do a good job when you can just be corrupt and force your political beliefs,” stated another. Non-fans rolled their eyes. South Park retroactively changed its sole Black kid character’s name from Token to Tolkien, the kind of backhanded acknowledgment of its own mistakes that are a staple of the irreverent cartoon’s sense of humor. It’s tempting to dismiss the complaining as the usual internet nerd rage. Similar disputes played out when actors of color started taking new major roles in Star Wars products. But the conflict is also about the rise of two kinds of media empire, not just one: there is Amazon, the crown jewel in the vast business empire of Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, and there is YouTube, a place for every dork who likes to complain about pop culture and whose darker corners are a frequent haunt of racism and bigotry. One group is populated by people who can afford to buy the rights to The Lord of the Rings, and the other is populated by people for whom The Lord of the Rings is the second-best thing to the Bible, but for both, an incredible amount of money and influence is at stake. And Amazon is probably wary that its grand project could be vulnerable to attacks by aggrieved online superfans. YouTubers complaining about “fan mistreatment” have hundreds of thousands, sometimes millions of subscribers. Inevitably, these fans are devoted to movies, TV shows and comics from their childhoods and many are constantly on the watch for a new version that might expand the role of women, add characters of color, or include characters who aren’t straight. When they’re riled up, they can coordinate broad campaigns of harassment and even threats of violence across social media and skew perception of public opinion. It’s the sort of thing that often meets with the approval of the broader rightwing media, which will sometimes fan the flames of a useful controversy. Talented social media trolls have gone on to jobs on cable television. In human terms, being the target of rightwing hate campaigns can be draining and depressing. in business terms, it can really mess with a marketing budget, and that kind of power is attractive to permanently aggrieved pop culture devotees. The extremity of protest over the “unrealistic” presence of a Black dwarf princess feels silly, considering the stories themselves are about wizards and magic rings and the occasional dragon. But audiences, says Ebony Thomas, author of The Dark Fantastic and an associate professor at the University of Michigan, are not wrong when they say that Black characters seem like they just don’t belong in the notoriously white fantasy genre. “The history of fantasy is racialized,” she says. “People are used to seeing fantasies and fairytales as all-white, particularly in faux-medieval or magical-medieval settings,” Thomas explains. “We’re taking them out of the dream space. We’re taking them out of how they imagined it could be, and so it feels off to them. So that’s why they’re saying, you know, ‘Who are these people? This is not what Tolkien intended! It’s not accurate!’” Of course, if you’re willing to go back to the poems and legends that inspired Tolkien, you will definitely find characters who are not white. The Norse Prose Edda, compiled in 1220, includes the svartálfar, Black elves who live in Svartálfarheim; Tolkien was a devotee of Old Norse prose and verse and even translated some of the verse into English. But, despite that, it is a fraught time to be adapting anything with even a hint of Norseness to it. American fascist organizations use Norse iconography publicly in lieu of more easily recognized swastikas and Confederate flags. American “European heritage” groups are obsessed with Norse gods and runes. These groups are often violent, and when they rally behind a symbol, the people they target tend to turn away from it. Some devotees are refusing to cede that ground, arguing that such symbols – and fantasy more broadly – should be for everyone. “White Supremacists don’t own Norse Mythology, even if some of them think they do, any more than they own the Bible, or the US Constitution, even though they might think they do,” wrote fantasist Neil Gaiman on Twitter. Gaiman is qualified to deliver that rebuke: he’s written his own Norse mythology and a novel incorporating it (and other traditions) into American myth-making, American Gods. In fact, despite its array of wizards, magic objects, warring races and deep wells of mythology, The Lord of the Rings is a decidedly non-threatening tale: fundamentally a comforting story of middle-class heroes of multiple races who triumph over enormous odds to save their way of life by working together against a common foe. This is poor soil for exterminationism – more of a saccharine conservatism, complicated by Tolkien’s own experiences in the first world war. “I don’t think these books are ‘fascist’,” wrote the great British fantasist Michael Moorcock in 1978, “but they certainly don’t exactly argue with the 18th-century enlightened Toryism with which the English comfort themselves so frequently in these upsetting times.” Moorcock thought Tolkien owed a lot to AA Milne; he called the Rings books “Epic Pooh”. American conservatives, too, especially evangelical Christians who venerate Tolkien and CS Lewis, love Tolkien’s preoccupation with the simple life and disdain for anything urban or industrial. So is it fundamentally disrespectful to do what Amazon has done by making a modern adaptation of such a traditionalist work with a non-traditional cast? Thomas, who loves Tolkien, doesn’t think so, and she points out that the notoriously restrictive Tolkien estate doesn’t think so, either. In this case, Tolkien’s official interpreters are far less concerned with uniform pigmentation among the cast than they are with making sure the new show doesn’t touch the potentially lucrative events of The Silmarillion, a posthumous novel the estate would surely like to see sold to a big movie studio for gobs of cash. The question, Thomas says, is not merely of accuracy, but of authenticity, and given that race is an arbitrary construct anyway, it’s not somehow less authentic to cast Black actors than it is to cast white ones. “My ancestors have been here, speaking English, for 10 generations,” she says. “It’s not the case that some strange people who are not from Anglo-American culture are suddenly demanding representation. We’ve been here for centuries. We have been existing.”",Arts/Film,‘The history of fantasy is racialized’: Lord of the Rings series sparks debate over race,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/feb/20/lord-of-the-rings-amazon-series-race
2/20/2022,"As some US companies begin asking people to return to the office and governors lift mask mandates, talk has emerged of life after the Covid-19 pandemic in America. But infectious disease experts aren’t quite ready to declare that it’s safe for individuals, rather than governments and health officials, to determine whether precautions such as masking indoors are necessary.  “I think it’s probably reasonable not to get too cocky at this point,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “I welcome the decline in cases that we are seeing in the US and a number of other countries, and I think you can both celebrate the sunshine while also keeping an umbrella close by for the possibility that rain could occur.” The numbers of Covid cases and hospitalizations in the United States have decreased by 67% and 38% over the last two weeks, according to data from the New York Times. Amid that decline, Democratic governors in Massachusetts, Illinois, New York, Rhode Island, California, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and Oregon have recently lifted at least some parts of the masking mandates. California governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday announced a plan based on the idea that we are entering an endemic stage, meaning the virus is no longer a significant threat in some areas, rather than a pandemic, meaning a global outbreak. That new approach includes a focus on countering misinformation and disinformation and mass testing to spot new variants and surges, according to the Associated Press. US companies, most notably, Microsoft, have also announced plans to reopen their facilities and asked employees to return. And Amazon, where many people already worked in person, announced that it would not require fully vaccinated employees to wear masks, according to the Wall Street Journal. “While the world has changed, our dedication to the safety and wellbeing of our employees has remained constant,” Microsoft said in a blogpost about the reopening. “As we navigate this new phase of work, we’ll continue to take a data-driven approach to decision making that follows the guidance of public health authorities.” But Justin Lessler, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina, says that while the numbers of Covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations have recently plummeted, the fact that the Omicron spike was so much higher than previous waves has misled people into thinking that they no longer need to wear masks or avoid mass gatherings. The US daily average of cases and hospitalizations on 16 February were about 124,000 and 81,000, according to the Times. Before removing precautions, Lessler said he would like to see Covid levels like late June 2021 – before the Delta wave – when the daily averages of new cases and hospitalizations were about 12,000 and 16,000. Modeling shows the US could achieve that around late March, he said. “In most of the country, cases, deaths and hospitalizations are still extremely high, and I certainly hope that’s not the new normal, and I don’t believe it’s the new normal,” Lessler said. “I worry that the perception that we are already there is going to lead people to act in ways that is going to draw this out longer than it needs to be drawn out.” William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, also thinks that we cannot yet treat the virus as though it is endemic. “Some governors think we are almost there are already – they are dropping mask mandates – and my response is: good luck to you,” said Schaffner. “My fingers are crossed on your behalf.” Almost the entire country remains at what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines as high transmission of the virus, meaning a seven-day daily average of more than 100 new Covid cases per 100,000 residents. Anna Bershteyn, assistant professor in the department of population health at New York University, thinks more companies will ask employees to return once their surrounding county drops at least to a level of “substantial transmission,” meaning less than 100 new cases per 100,000 residents. Companies will also consider the vaccination levels of their workforce and the severity of a new variant, among other factors, Bershteyn said. She recommends employers use a framework of “always measures,” such as increasing clean air exchanges in indoor spaces; and ensuring that workers are fully vaccinated and stay home when sick; “sometimes measures,” when case numbers are higher, such as mandating masks and proof of vaccination to be on the premises; and “rarely measures,” such as temporarily closing a business. Also, “people can reduce their risk in the long term for Covid-19 by improving general health, so taking the opportunity when transmission is low to catch up on any health care that has been missed … staying on top of weight, exercise and diet; and recovering economic losses and educational losses; and really importantly, restoring some of the social connections and those activities that are really important to a person’s wellbeing,” said Bershteyn. Nuzzo, the Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, also thinks that the country needs to end its binary thinking on precautions, “that we either care about the virus and are trying to do something about it – or we’re not,” she said. “The option not to care is not an option, but how we try to address the virus can and should change with the data,” she said. “That may include shifting from mandatory measures to recommended measures … It may mean that we put masks at the front of the entrance to the coffee shop for people to take if they so choose, but we don’t have the poor barista have to yell at somebody and call the police if somebody is not wearing a mask.” Nuzzo and other epidemiologists also do not take it as a given that a new variant won’t emerge that overcomes the population’s immunity against the virus. “It’s not like you are going down on a rollercoaster and are just going to keep on cruising. We could see the cases go up again, and I think we have to be mentally and socially prepared that if we are experiencing another surge, we may have to dust off some measures that we got to take a break from,” she said. Dr Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiologist at New York University, also thinks the pandemic will be shaped by individuals’ risk tolerance and how well we protect demographics such as low-income populations and residents of long-term care facilities. That means, for example, ensuring that everyone at a nursing home is vaccinated and boosted. “Instead of having top-down recommendations for everyone, we are entering a phase soon where what we need to be doing is arming people with the information and tools to protect themselves and their loved ones,” she said. “And as opposed to blanket recommendations for the whole population, we need to really focus our public health efforts on the most vulnerable.”",News/World news,Experts warn ‘not to get too cocky’ as US contemplates life after Covid,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/20/us-covid-coronavirus-mask-mandates-warning-experts
2/20/2022,"Holding a gold microphone and wearing a seafoam-green pantsuit, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez energized the San Antonio crowd with her vision for flipping the state of Texas to Democratic control. “It will happen,” Ocasio-Cortez said at a rally earlier this month. “The only question is when, Texas.”  As the crowd cheered, she added: “The work that you put in today, the work that you put in tomorrow, the work that you put in on Monday – when you go one more door when you’re tired, when you make one more call when you feel exhausted, you’re bringing that day one day sooner.” The progressives in the audience roared in response, hanging on to her every word. “Texas will turn blue,” @AOC says to the crowd as they cheer her on. “It's inevitable!” pic.twitter.com/YZBJHCbx1n Four years after bursting on to the national political stage with a shocking primary victory over a long-serving House Democrat, Ocasio-Cortez is using her substantial political influence to promote progressive candidates and policies. Ocasio-Cortez’s first campaign in 2018 was largely dismissed as a pipe dream, but the leftwing New York congresswoman is now impossible to ignore. Just this month, the New Yorker interviewed Ocasio-Cortez about the fight for voting rights and her role as a progressive icon, while the editors of New York magazine are releasing a book documenting her rapid rise in Democratic politics. As she makes headlines, Ocasio-Cortez has continued to use her massive social media following and her significant campaign war chest to advance her leftist policy agenda. With Democrats bracing for a potentially disastrous midterm season, the congresswoman’s actions on the campaign trail and on Capitol Hill make it clear that she will continue to be a dominant force for the progressive movement. There seems to be no question now: AOC is here to stay. Ocasio-Cortez travelled to Texas this month to campaign for two of the progressive candidates she has endorsed this election cycle, Jessica Cisneros and Greg Casar. Since her first victory in 2018, Ocasio-Cortez has used her celebrity status to help other progressives attract voters and raise money, which she has a unique talent for. During the 2020 cycle, her campaign committee raised more than $20m. “Having her there on stage with you, it just is an amazing experience,” said James Thompson, a former congressional candidate who held a 2018 rally with Ocasio-Cortez in Wichita, Kansas. “The immediate impact on my campaign was fundraising. We raised a substantial amount of money off of the rally that we had here. It really energized the people.” An endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez has the ability to immediately elevate a progressive candidate’s campaign, and the congresswoman does not limit herself to open-seat races. In the four years since she won her own primary against the then congressman Joe Crowley, Ocasio-Cortez has endorsed a number of candidates who are challenging sitting lawmakers. Cisneros, for example, is attempting to defeat Henry Cuellar, a Democrat who has served in the House since 2005. “AOC endorses more primary challengers to incumbents than pretty much anyone who is a current incumbent in Congress,” said Waleed Shahid, a spokesperson for Justice Democrats, which backed Ocasio-Cortez’s first campaign. “I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that she was the primary challenger to an incumbent, so she knows personally how difficult it is to get support for something that requires that level of courage.” But Ocasio-Cortez’s willingness to openly oppose Democratic incumbents has rankled some of her House colleagues who have been on the receiving end of her criticism. “This election is taking place in the 28th congressional District of Texas – not New York City,” Cuellar’s campaign said in a statement ahead of Ocasio-Cortez’s rallies in San Antonio and Austin. “The voters will decide this election, not far-left celebrities who stand for defunding the police, open borders, eliminating oil & gas jobs, and raising taxes on hard working Texans. Members should take care of their own district before taking failed ideas to South Texas.” Ocasio-Cortez’s rallies in Texas also displayed her singular ability to enrage her Republican critics, who swiftly denounced her suggestion that the traditionally conservative state would inevitably move to the left. “If AOC thinks for a moment that Texans will fall for her whacked-out, woke, socialist idiocy, she doesn’t know Texas,” said Dan Patrick, the state’s lieutenant governor. But to Ocasio-Cortez’s many admirers, her frequent clashes with Democrats and Republicans alike have set an example for a new kind of politics. “She’s been an inspiration, I think, to a lot of people,” Thompson said. “Now, I think that scares the hell out of the Democratic party though, too, because we’re bucking the establishment and saying, ‘Look, we want you to represent the people, not just party interest.’” Ocasio-Cortez’s willingness to clash with members of her party extends beyond the campaign trail to her work in Congress. Earlier this month, she pursued the bold strategy of trying to force a vote on a bill to ban members of Congress from trading stocks. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, had voiced opposition to the proposed ban, and Ocasio-Cortez’s tactics seemed aimed at forcing the hand of Democratic leadership. (Pelosi has since struck a more open-minded tone about the ban on members’ stock-trading.) Ocasio-Cortez has also been unafraid to criticize some of her centrist colleagues who have attacked progressive policy proposals. On Friday, after Axios published a report suggesting moderate Democrats blamed the party’s falling polling numbers on progressives and their support for the “defund the police” movement, Ocasio-Cortez hit back over Twitter. She argued the real reason behind Democrats’ bleak prospects in the midterm elections was the party’s failure to pass the Build Back Better Act, the $1.75tn spending package at the heart of Joe Biden’s economic agenda. Ocasio-Cortez accused her centrist colleagues of tanking the legislation by allowing the bipartisan infrastructure bill to pass on its own, leaving Democrats with nothing to campaign on. “They don’t know how to accept responsibility so are lazily blaming the same folks they always do,” Ocasio-Cortez said. Rahna Epting, the executive director of the progressive group MoveOn, similarly dismissed claims that Ocasio-Cortez and her allies are dragging down Democrats’ electoral prospects as “utter nonsense”. “Members of Congress of the progressive flank have raised expectations on Democrats broadly to deliver and prioritize people over profits. There is nothing wrong with that,” Epting said. “What Democrats need to do is to stop the infighting.” Epting, whose group was one of the only progressive organizations to endorse Ocasio-Cortez during her 2018 primary battle, praised the congresswoman for using her platform to advocate for important issues including student debt relief and the climate crisis. “AOC’s superpower is to expose and shed light on corruption and injustices that have been longstanding,” Epting said. “I think she has been one of the most electrifying members of Congress, probably in the history of the United States. And she’s a true champion for people.” But Ocasio-Cortez will be the first to admit that her hopes of enacting meaningful progressive policies have suffered setbacks in recent months. Build Back Better remains stalled in the Senate because of Democrat Joe Manchin’s opposition, and the party has failed to enact national voting rights legislation. Instead of bemoaning congressional inaction, though, Ocasio-Cortez has urged patience. “We have a culture of immediate gratification where if you do something and it doesn’t pay off right away, we think it’s pointless,” she told the New Yorker. “There is no movement, there is no effort, there is no unionizing, there is no fight for the vote, there is no resistance to draconian abortion laws, if people think that the future is baked in and nothing is possible and that we’re doomed.” Thompson has seen the long-term impact of Ocasio-Cortez’s work for himself. He lost his 2018 race, but since then, the politics of Wichita have shifted. Democrats now make up a majority of the Wichita city council, when they previously only held one of seven seats. “Even though I didn’t win, her coming really energized our local Democrats in our community,” Thompson said. “It made us realize that look, we’re not alone. And we can do something when we come together.”",News/US news,Campaigning AOC electrifies crowds as Democrats fear brutal midterms,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/feb/19/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-democrats-midterms-texas
2/20/2022,"It is 15 years since the Equality and Human Rights Commission, the independent body charged with protecting and promoting equality and human rights for everyone in Britain, came into being. We regulate and enforce human rights and equality laws and advance rights through carefully considered recommendations for reform. While we have made significant progress over the past 15 years, there will always be more to do. We have many and varied stakeholders – knowledgeable and effective advocates in encouraging and challenging us to address the equality and human rights issues about which they care deeply. Our relationships with civic organisations, campaigners and those they represent are vitally important in helping to inform our thinking and our priorities. But with our vast remit and so many people and groups advocating on so many issues, it is inevitable that we can’t please all of them all of the time.  My position and integrity as the EHRC’s chair have come in for particular criticism by some stakeholders, who perceive that the commission has undergone a shift in its approach. I can’t speak for how the previous chair ran things, but I can say that what matters to me, to the board and our new chief executive is that we are determined to uphold our independence, impartiality, evidence-based decision-making and to resist undue influence from any quarter. This has put us at odds with some of our stakeholders recently, but this isn’t new. The EHRC has often been criticised over the years and it is not a comfortable place to be in – for our commissioners, for our committed staff or for those stakeholders who disagree with us. But it is an unavoidable part of our role in regulating a legal framework that recognises nine protected characteristics, frequently with competing rights and needs. We have a statutory duty to consider equality and human rights for everyone and that includes how the rights of one person, or group, might be affected by the rights of another. We do not allow our decisions and actions to be swayed by the loudest voices in any particular debate. We are accountable to parliament and held to exacting standards in fulfilling our mandate. The legal basis for our governance, including the process for the appointment of the chair and commissioners, is enshrined in our founding legislation and is unchanged since the EHRC was established. It applied to my appointment as it did for those of my predecessors under previous Labour, coalition and Conservative governments. The latest pressure arises from the polarised debates about the rights of transgender people, who face hate crime and barriers to changing their legal gender, such as excessively long waiting times for gender identity clinics. This is wrong and we have been lobbying government to do something about it. We have also been upholding the rights of transgender people at work, in recent legal interventions with employers. Where we have modified our position on self-ID for trans people or the Gender Recognition Act, we have done so because new evidence about the tension between trans and women’s rights is emerging. Only last week, there have been seemingly contradictory legal judgments on the meaning of “sex” in law. Other cases are in the pipeline. Recently, public responses to our strategic plan have shown a huge increase in concern about these competing rights. Last month, I wrote to the Scottish government to advise that further consideration is needed to some specific aspects of the proposals, to take account of issues raised in relation to data collection, single-sex service provision and new case law. I said absolutely nothing to suggest any wavering of our commitment to trans rights. We have also been accused of standing in the way of a ban on “conversion therapy”. Not true. Conversion therapy is harmful and the EHRC supports it ending for both sexual orientation and being transgender. We have advised the UK government that a lack of legal definitions of terms such as “being trans” risks ambiguity about what will be caught by the ban and what will not. We recommended that parliament conducts comprehensive scrutiny of the legislation to ensure not only that harmful practices are prevented but also that transgender people can receive the advice and support they need. Debate about contested issues is necessary and I admire all who stand up for rights and causes, fight discrimination and seek equality and justice. They help our country to shape a fairer future. And so do we. So I ask those – and it is a minority – who seek to undermine the EHRC: what do they hope to achieve and who do they think will protect and advance equality and human rights in our country if they have their wish?

2/20/2022,"In cities such as Kabul, Herat and Bamyan, you feel a profound sense of shame when you see the after-effects of the west’s abandonment of Afghanistan: the long queues for food; the people persecuted and sometimes killed for trying to defend the freedoms they have gained in the past 20 years. Only six months after the fall of Kabul, the American and British media seem mostly to have forgotten about it. Typically, the judgment seems to be that we should never have gone in to help Afghanistan in the first place: as though that solves anything. The catastrophe began before the 2020 US election, when Donald Trump was casting around for anything he could claim as a foreign policy victory, following a series of failures with North Korea, Russia and China. Afghanistan meant nothing to Trump, and he handed it to the Taliban on a plate. There was no obligation on Joe Biden, when he became president, to follow through with this embarrassing deal; but he was desperate to show that he too put American interests before anyone else’s, and he allowed it to stand. After all, when does a US president put a small country’s needs before the chance of an uptick in the domestic opinion polls?  The disaster in Afghanistan shows up American and western weaknesses in a way that not even the defeat in Vietnam did. A powerful new collection of essays, Losing Afghanistan, points out again and again that people around the world now see the US as a fickle ally. What, for instance, does it say to China at a time when Xi Jinping is mulling over the invasion of Taiwan? One of the best pieces here comes from a former British diplomat, Nick Fishwick, who served in Afghanistan: he blames the west’s failure on weak leadership, an ignorance of the country, short tours of duty and a desire to compete with one’s predecessors. He’s right. Graham Cundy, who served with the Royal Marines there, speaks with insight about British mistakes in Helmand Province. But this wasn’t so much a failure of the men and women on the ground as of politicians back in Washington. There are valuable contributions here on the reactions of Afghanistan’s near neighbours, Pakistan and India, and on the Russian experience. (Russia comes out of this study reasonably well; it has maintained a steady interest in Afghan affairs ever since its withdrawal from the country in 1989, yet has been careful not to interfere in its politics.) There’s less detail on China’s approach. In Kabul recently, I spoke to the deputy finance minister, Nazir Kabiri, who was a member of the last regime and stayed on to work with the Taliban out of sheer patriotism; they have scarcely anyone who understands economics. Kabiri told me the Taliban would like China to take more of an interest in the country, but the Chinese have refused, preferring countries that offer five or six years of political stability. One of the most valuable sections of Losing Afghanistan deals with the future of liberal interventionism. The 2001 invasion was often regarded as a reasonably good argument in favour of stepping in to rescue a country from disaster. But authorities as varied as Prof Paul Dixon, Prof Stephen Gethins, the writer Mahmud Khalili, Jeremy Purvis of the Liberal Democrats, Masoud Andarabi, interior minister of Afghanistan immediately before the Taliban takeover, and the book’s compiler, the distinguished historian Brian Brivati, make clear how and why August 2021 has changed all that. The era of Blair, Clinton and Bush is definitively over. Victory for the Taliban wasn’t inevitable, but with hindsight there was too much corruption under the old regime, and the Afghan National Army was nowhere near as well trained and confident as the west assumed. The new regime has turned out to be more savvy than the old Taliban leadership of 1996-2001, under the reclusive Mullah Omar. Whereas the old Taliban blew up girls’ schools and murdered their pupils, the new Taliban have so far refused to issue any nationwide guidance about women’s education. Presumably they expect this will form part of a long-term deal with western powers over the country’s frozen financial assets. At present, the Taliban control the cities and the surrounding countryside, but it’s only a matter of time before large-scale resistance gets going. If the Taliban hope to survive, they will have to be more inclusive, and accept a wider range of political and religious opinion. But old habits die hard, and the toll on individual lives will continue to be great. Losing Afghanistan is interleaved with brief but shocking accounts of the way people have suffered since the Taliban took over: “A policewoman faces a dangerous future”; “Losing my culture overnight”; “A mother turns to sex work”. This book provides a really valuable snapshot of the mess that President Biden chose to create, in a country that was entirely dependent on his whims. One of the results of the chaos left by the western allies will, of course, be a renewed torrent of migrants to the outside world. In a moving and beautifully written book, The Naked Don’t Fear the Water, the respected journalist Matthieu Aikins, who writes for the New York Times Magazine and Rolling Stone, tells the story of a young Afghan driver and translator who decides to flee his war-torn country and make the perilous journey to the west. Omar escaped from Afghanistan in 2016, long before the Taliban took power again, but his reasons for leaving had long been present: economic hardship; a lack of freedom of expression that young, open-minded people find stifling; the desire to see and experience another world. Highly readable, empathetic and revealing, Aikins’s book is brutally honest and often deeply moving – a work of great sympathy and understanding. Above all, it explains why so many thousands of Afghans and others risk their lives to follow Omar’s lead, often with tragic consequences. Now, more and more of them will be prepared to take their chances. Every day outside the Iranian consulates in cities such as Herat, thousands queue up in the hope of getting a visa. Few of them actually want to stay in Iran: they hope to use it as a staging point before moving westwards. The catastrophe that President Biden has inflicted on Afghanistan will have consequences in the region and the world for decades to come. And it was all done in a moment of carelessness, with no proper thought or understanding. As one former Afghan politician says: “It was utterly unforgivable. The Americans just didn’t care enough about our country to know what they were doing to us.” John Simpson is the BBC’s world affairs editor  Losing Afghanistan: The Fall of Kabul and the End of Western Intervention is published by Biteback Publishing (£20); The Naked Don’t Fear the Water is published by Fitzcarraldo Editions (£12.99).

2/20/2022,"Our eyes are used to photographs that know faces. The photographers Eva Lipman and Ken Graves were far more interested in understanding the language of hands. This picture from their book Restraint and Desire is typical of their fascination. The longer we look at it, the more it reveals of the nuanced lexicon of touch, the way palms and fingers describe the emotion of relationships. Do the couple dancing or embracing appear startled by the hands of two others? Are they being subtly pushed together or gently prised apart? Do the splayed male fingers and rucked dress suggest an easy intimacy or an awkward grip? Is the woman with her back to us being comforted or congratulated? Are these hellos or goodbyes? The uncaptioned pictures force us to project our own storyline on to the closeness of strangers, just as we do instinctively a hundred times a day.  Lipman and Graves met while taking pictures of a ballroom dance competition in Ohio in 1986. They subsequently married and worked closely together. Graves died in 2016 aged 74. Lipman dedicates the book to him: “I will forever be grateful for his love and generosity, his unfailing optimism, and for sharing with me his strange and unique world view. I miss him every day.” That shared world view is preserved in the 42 pictures in their book, which are all about fleeting moments of connection, people reaching out to one another in different settings – teenagers at a dancehall, soldiers preparing for parade, wrestlers on a mat. We might read shadows of desire and rejection in these pictures, or we might miss them. Lipman describes how she and her husband were drawn to moments that “reflected back to us, like a mirror, the intensities and power dynamics of our shared life together”.

2/20/2022,"My Irish mother taught me always to try to see the good in people. But it has to be admitted that the attempt to see the good in Alexander “Boris” Johnson would, in another of her favourite sayings, “try the patience of Job”. It is already a commonplace in this country and around the civilised world that our prime minister is a charlatan on an industrial scale. John Major knew what he was about when declaring, as a prime minister himself, that Johnson should not even be allowed to fight a parliamentary seat.  The late Lord Carrington resigned as foreign secretary on principle over the fiasco that led to the Falklands war in 1982 – the war generally thought to have saved Margaret Thatcher’s skin after she’d achieved the dubious distinction of being the most unpopular prime minister since the second world war. Many years later, Carrington found himself listening to some young-fogey Tories discussing the case for making Johnson prime minister. There was a pause. “Anyway,” said the good Lord, “he won’t do.” There are some Johnson loyalists who say he should do the decent thing and resign as honourably as he can in the circumstances. But most witnesses to the sorry spectacle of his premiership think he couldn’t spot a decent thing even if it were a favoured horse running in the 3.30 at Newmarket. I am reminded of Dostoevsky’s short story A Bad Business. Things go badly wrong when the general, whose driver has disappeared, turns down a lift from a colleague and heads off into the night, with unfortunate repercussions. It has been a Bad Business since Johnson, who – notwithstanding his irresponsible reporting of fantasy stories about Brussels – was in no doubt that it would be crazy for the UK to leave the EU, but decided to put self-interest above country in leading the mendacious Leave campaign. But “here we are”, as Harold Macmillan once said, “and the question is: where do we go from here?” Macmillan was prime minister when the British economy was lagging behind what was then the European Economic Community. We tried forming a rival group – the European Free Trade Area (EFTA), seven nations as opposed to the EEC Six. The joke was that Europe was “at sixes and sevens”. It soon became apparent that we needed to link up with the EEC. We applied twice, were turned down by President de Gaulle, and finally joined in 1973. Now I have an awful feeling of deja vu. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and his shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves talk about “making Brexit work”. I can only hope that this is tactical stuff intended to appease “red wall” voters, who were really protesting at the social consequences of several decades of industrial decline – and, let’s face it, the well-meant but disastrous Labour leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. It looks as though Labour’s defeated Remainers envisage a return to the 1950s and early 1960s, to begin the process of “rebuilding a relationship with the EU” – a process whose logical outcome would be rejoining in decades to come. But why wait? Why should Labour attach itself to the chimerical goal of “making Brexit work?” For the truth that dare not speak its name is that Brexit doesn’t work, and never will. The experiment has been tried – and has failed. All this stuff about the “opportunities of Brexit?” There are none. Johnson may have packed his sordid cabinet with Brexiters and time-servers, but the all-party public accounts committee is beyond the reach of his soiled hands. As its chair, Dame Meg Hillier, was reported as saying in the Financial Time: the only detectable impact of Brexit is “increased costs, paperwork and border delays”. There was a classic moment on television last week when a lorry driver held up in one of those dreadful queues on the Dover road was asked: “Is it going to get any better?” His reply was to the point: “Not unless we go back into the EU.” Now, I read that it suits Labour, while protesting against him all the way to the electoral bank, to see Johnson remain in office. But, to paraphrase Carrington above: this won’t do. The man has besmirched the office, and the good name of the country. One of the Brexit secretaries who failed “to make Brexit work” – because it can’t – is my old friend David Davis. He was right to echo Cromwell and say to Johnson: “In the name of God, go!” Even if Johnson were to be succeeded by another Brexiter, there are no morally cogent grounds for acquiescing in his continuance in office. I cannot resist concluding with yet another quotation from the Roman poet Juvenal: “Hoc volo, sic iubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas.” (“I want this done, so I order it done: let my wish replace rational judgment.”) This epitomises our present prime minister’s mentality. A nation suffers.",News/Business,How much longer do we have to pretend that Brexit might work?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/feb/20/how-much-longer-do-we-have-to-pretend-that-brexit-might-work
2/20/2022,"There is now a significant risk of people drowning in London as the threat of major flash floods increases in the city because of climate change. According to a report by a London Councils taskforce published this month, the danger is particularly severe because there is no overall plan or authority to tackle the increasing threat of flooding in the city. In its analysis of the citywide disruption that struck last July, when torrential rain swept across London on several occasions, the group says that more than a month’s average rain fell on the city in an hour on several different days. For example 48.5mm of rain fell on Shepherd’s Bush in an hour on 12 July while its average rainfall for that month is 46.8mm.  Across London, tube stations were flooded, hospitals closed, and more than 1,000 homes inundated. As deluges become more frequent as global warming takes hold, there is now a real risk that London could see far greater increases in devastation from surface water flooding. The taskforce presented its report earlier to the London Councils, a cross-party group that represents the capital’s 32 boroughs and the City of London. It showed that the worst effects of the flooding were seen in the north and east of the city, adding that it was not clear “that residents in risk areas understand the level of risk that they now face and how to respond”. This point was highlighted by Bob Ward, deputy chair of the London Climate Change Partnership. “There is now a real risk of people drowning, particularly in basement flats if a major flash flood occurred in the middle of the night,” he told the Observer. “The problem is particularly worrying because we have no idea how many people live in basement properties in London.” The report also warned that “London has an increasing area of impermeable surfacing and still essentially relies on a Victorian drainage system that was not designed to cope with the city’s current and predicted future populations.” It highlighted the fact there was no single organisation in charge of tackling surface water flooding in London; there was insufficient funding to manage the risk, and a lack of understanding of the risks posed by surface water flooding. Major improvements in all these areas were urgently needed if the city is to cope with future serious inundations. The danger facing the city is highlighted as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scientists prepare the final draft of a report outlining how nations must adapt to avoid the worst consequences of changes in storm frequencies and weather patterns that will occur in coming years. Last month the government published its third five-yearly assessment of the risks that Britain faces from the changing climate, and painted a future of drastic disruption and costly impacts. It indicated that the climate crisis was likely to wipe at least 1% a year off the UK’s economy by 2045 if global temperatures were allowed to rise by 2C (3.6F). Disruption to food production, and infrastructure were likely to cost more than £1bn a year each, the report warned. In all, at least eight areas of risk were judged likely to cost more than £1bn a year by 2050. Environment groups reacted to the government report by warning that it showed that ministers needed to take more urgent action to defend the country against the effects of climate change. “This report makes clear that even modest increases in global temperature will have profound impacts across every aspect of our lives,” Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK said. “Adaptation can no longer be an afterthought. Action on climate change of all kinds needs to be right at the heart of government policy and programmes.”",News/UK news,London flooding poses ‘significant risk’ unless immediate action taken,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/feb/20/london-flooding-poses-significant-risk-unless-immediate-action-taken
2/20/2022,"Mikaela Shiffrin will travel home empty-handed from the Beijing Winter Games after the United States missed the podium by 0.42 seconds in the mixed team parallel on Sunday afternoon. The 26-year-old American star, the headline attraction of a US team including River Radamus, Paula Moltzan and Tommy Ford, came tantalizingly close to a redemptive bronze after defeating a Slovakia team without star Petra Vlhova in their opening tie before upsetting Italy to reach the medal round.  But the Americans were denied a shot at gold by Germany in the semi-finals, then bowed to Norway in a bronze-medal match-up on a tie-breaker to finish in fourth place and out of the medals. Top-seeded Austria won the gold in the mixed-gender team event, which debuted on the Olympic programme four years ago in Pyeongchang, edging a German team who settled for silver. The knockout competition represented Shiffrin’s last chance at a medal after she finished no better than ninth in five individual races while failing to cross the finish line entirely in three of them, an outcome that would have been unthinkable a fortnight ago when the three-time overall World Cup champion and two-time Olympic gold medalist arrived with designs on Janica Kostelic’s women’s record of four medals at a single Winter Games. “I am not disappointed,” Shiffrin said. “I have had a lot of disappointing moments at these Games. Today is not one of them – today is my favourite memory. “This was the best possible way that I could imagine ending the Games, skiing with such strong teammates.” The last alpine skiing event of the Beijing Games finally went off on Sunday morning, having been postponed for a day because of high winds, on the Ice River course that has been a house of horrors for Shiffrin at these Olympics. She entered Sunday’s curtain-dropper having not made it to the bottom of the course in the slalom, the giant slalom and the slalom portion of the alpine combined, skiing out three times in the technical races that are the foundation of her dominance. The Americans were seeded sixth in the bracket-style competition where each round consists of two men and two women going head to head on adjacent courses in a series of four heats. The team with the majority of wins in each matchup advances to the next round while 2-all deadlocks are decided by the lower combined time of each team’s fastest man and fastest woman. The course is shorter – most of Sunday’s runs lasted about 25 seconds – and even the competitors themselves admit the stakes are considerably lower. But there’s no question that a medal could have offered some consolation for Shiffrin amid the lowest period of a professional life defined by dizzying highs. Shiffrin completed four clean runs down the abbreviated giant slalom course on another morning of high winds and sub-zero temperatures on the south side of Xiaohaituo Mountain. But after winning her opening heat from the leadoff position to help the United States advance past Slovakia, she was placed on the slower red course for the final three matchups and lost each time. The full-day postponement due to Saturday’s roughly 65kph (40mph) gusts at the top of the course forced Shiffrin to alter her travel plans, a decision that she did not make lightly ahead of next week’s World Cup races in Crans Montana, Switzerland. But the American said the opportunity to cap an Olympic experience that hasn’t always been pleasant alongside her team-mates was worth the sacrifice. “Twenty-four hours makes a really big difference when I think about my individual goals, my personal goals, for the rest of the season,” said Shiffrin, who narrowly leads Vlhova atop the leaderboard in pursuit of her fourth overall World Cup crystal globe. “There was absolutely some thought that the 24 hours makes a difference to be still pushing and using that energy. I decided to stay because I wanted to compete with my teammates. I couldn’t possibly imagine leaving. There’s been a lot of points in my career where I had to put my individual interests first in order to have the success, accomplish the goals.” She added: “Today it was just important for us to be able to compete together. And they have been supportive of me this entire Games – just unbelievable. They just deserve to know how much I love them and how much I wanted to just try to help and have the potential to win a medal today.” Once a teenage prodigy who became the youngest Olympic slalom champion in history at the Sochi Games, Shiffrin has since blossomed from a specialist into the world’s best all-around skier, branching out into the speed events with success and becoming the only skier, male or female, to win World Cup races in all six disciplines. Her three Olympic medals include gold in slalom in 2014 and in giant slalom in 2018, while her 73 career wins in World Cup races are third-most on the all-time leaderboard, trailing only Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark (86) and longtime US team-mate Lindsey Vonn (82). The US completed the alpine skiing programme in Beijing with only one medal out of a possible 30 in individual events: Ryan Cochran-Siegle’s surprise silver in the super-G.

The unsolicited multi-billion dollar offer, lodged on Saturday, would see Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes’ Grok Ventures acquire AGL’s power generation and energy retail divisions, which include coal, gas and renewable energy generation assets. The AGL board was meeting to discuss the offer on Sunday.  If successful, it is expected the new owners would aim to bring forward AGL’s exit from coal-fired power. It would also halt a planned demerger that would have broken off the company’s fossil fuel assets into a separate entity, to be called Accel Energy. The offer valued AGL only marginally above the company’s closing share price on Friday of $7.16. Including AGL’s debt, the bid is in the range of $8bn, a source said. The owners of Australia’s coal-fired generators are under increasing pressure, both economic due to the rise of cheap solar energy in the national grid, and from activist shareholders to act in line with the Paris climate agreement. Earlier this month, AGL brought forward the planned closure date of the Bayswater black coal plant in New South Wales to no later than 2033, and Loy Yang A in the Latrobe Valley to 2045. On Thursday, Origin Energy gave notice that the country’s biggest coal-fired power plant, Eraring, could shut seven years earlier than scheduled – in 2025, rather than 2032. Cannon-Brookes, a renewable energy investor and vocal advocate for greater action on the climate crisis, has previously expressed an interest in backing clean energy assets to replace AGL’s ageing Liddell coal plant, which is due to shut next year. AGL’s coal-fired plants make it Australia’s biggest greenhouse gas emitter. It is responsible for about 8% of the national total. Brookfield last November secured approval from the foreign investment review board for the $17.8bn takeover of transmission group AusNet Services. Given AGL’s role as a major energy generator and retailer – before the planned demerger – the new bid may attract attention from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. AGL’s demerger is being advised by Macquarie Bank, while the Brookfield-Grok duo is being advised by Citi. AGL, Brookfield and Cannon-Brookes declined to comment. After reports of the takeover bid broke on Sunday afternoon, Cannon-Brookes tweeted: “Might be an afternoon espresso kind of day.” Bruce Mountain, director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, said if the AGL takeover went ahead Brookfield “would essentially be an investor, not a manager” and Cannon-Brookes would provide the strategy for the business. Mountain said AGL’s biggest asset was its energy retail business. Of its coal plants, Liddell is due to start shutting down its units later this year ahead of its scheduled closure by April 2023 and Bayswater, while profitable now, would be “a much less attractive asset” after its current low-price black coal subsidy ran out in 2024, he said. He said the fact the opening offer from Brookfield and Grok Ventures had apparently offered little premium above the share price was telling about AGL’s prospects as it struggled to engineer a new vision for the business while dealing with the legacy of old coal plants. Matt Kean, the NSW Treasurer and energy minister, said AGL’s future was a commercial decision. “The NSW government will continue to work with energy companies to maintain system reliability and lower power prices,” he said.",News/Australia news,Mike Cannon-Brookes and Brookfield in bid to take over AGL and shut down coal plants earlier,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/20/mike-cannon-brookes-and-brookfield-in-bid-to-takeover-agl-and-shut-down-coal-plants-earlier
