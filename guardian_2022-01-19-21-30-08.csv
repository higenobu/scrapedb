1/19/2022,"Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast clearly owes a debt to Alfonso Cuarón’s Roma. Both films are named after places. They’re both autobiographical. They’re both filmed in black and white for maximum awards season impact. And yet the films differ in one key area. Cuarón, for the most part, filled his film with authentic-looking non-actors. Branagh, meanwhile, filled his with Jamie Dornan. Which is no slight on Dornan. In recent years he’s proved himself to be one of our most charismatic and magnetic actors. Put a camera on Jamie Dornan and audiences won’t look away. Except in Belfast, he’s playing the down-at-heel dad of a family barely able to stay afloat. At one point he is almost sunk by a £500 tax bill. Which would be all too believable, save for the fact that Jamie Dornan looks like Jamie Dornan. If Belfast was set in any recognisable universe, then one of Dornan’s neighbours would have said, “Have you ever thought about becoming a model?”, or “I saw you singing Everlasting Love to professional standards in the club the other night, you could try doing that for a living”, or “You know what would get you out of this pickle? Playing a literal sex god in the movie adaptations of a wildly successful erotic novel series?” And he would have said yes and, because he is Jamie Dornan, all his debts would have been paid off by lunchtime.  But this is the world we live in. Belfast is far from alone in casting actors who are far too attractive for their roles. Cinema is absolutely littered with characters who read like schlubs despite being intimidatingly gorgeous. You’ll find examples of this everywhere. The 2013 remake of Carrie cast Chloë Grace Moretz – who uniformly looks like the most popular girl at school – as its lead; a mistake from which it could never recover. Part of the reason why they never made an Amazing Spider-Man 3 was because the classically handsome 27-year-old Andrew Garfield was wholly unbelievable as retiring high school student Peter Parker. And casting Samantha Barks as ragged, impoverished Éponine in Les Misérables was just silly. Look at that bone structure. Get out there and do some catalogue work, Éponine! You’re in Paris! The reigning queen of this is probably Kate Winslet, who has made something of a cottage industry of pretending that she isn’t as beautiful as she obviously is. In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Jim Carrey’s character takes great pains to explain to Winslet’s character that she’s pretty; a fact that would be easily proved in real life thanks to the invention of mirrors. She was hailed as “brave” for not wearing a lot of makeup in Mare of Easttown, even though Kate Winslet without makeup still looks an awful lot like Kate Winslet. Most egregiously, Winslet’s character in Little Children is heartbroken when Patrick Wilson tells her not to worry about her looks because “beauty is overrated”, even though he is literally talking to a woman whose face advertises L’Oréal for a living. That said, if you want to be inundated with beautiful people struggling to pass themselves off as normal, watch a romcom. Watch Notting Hill, in which it is considered ridiculous that a movie star like Julia Roberts could be attracted to a shambling uggo like, um, peak-era Hugh Grant. Or better yet, watch Maid in Manhattan, in which against all better judgment Ralph Fiennes sees the inner beauty of Jennifer Lopez, a woman so wildly attractive that as a secondary career she had to release a string of singles designed to convince everyone that although she looked like a millionaire pin-up from Planet Sex, she was actually a human being. But my favourite version of this happens in films that require a Cinderella-style transformation; where a beautiful actor has to try to ugly up a little before they can emerge triumphant as their fully formed movie star selves at the end. These used to be 10 a penny – Audrey Hepburn made Sabrina, My Fair Lady and Funny Face, all of which feature rough “normal woman turns into Audrey Hepburn” storylines – but one relatively recent example deserves to be held aloft as the best of them all. Nobody remembers the 2011 movie Limitless, because it was very stupid and life is short, but it contains the all-time greatest ugly-to-movie-star transformation. As the film opens we meet Bradley Cooper. He is (because he is Bradley Cooper) wildly handsome. Handsome enough, in fact, to land supermodel-beautiful Abbie Cornish as a long-term girlfriend. But he has a slightly ratty ponytail. “My excuse for looking like this? I’m a writer,” he bitterly remarks of himself at one point. But then a friend gives him a pill that allows him to reach the absolute pinnacle of human potential. The first thing he does with all this newfound knowledge is get a haircut.

1/19/2022,"From efforts to map Odysseus’s journey to Borges’s commentary on map-making in On Exactitude in Science (where the only sufficient map is in fact as large as the territory it depicts), fictions and maps have long maintained a complicated, entwined relationship. While the right map can uniquely resonate with a literary text, this resonance exists amid an undeniable tension: a concern that the map might demystify or oversimplify a story, at worst imposing a single, reductive viewpoint on something that should be open and unbounded.  Exploring this tension, while also charting the ways that the relationship between maps and literature has changed through eras and genres, the Huntington Library’s new exhibit Mapping Fictions brings together literary maps from hundreds of years of literary history. Drawing from the Huntington’s archives of rare literary texts, the exhibition goes back to the early days of modern literature with texts like The Pilgrim’s Progress and Journey to the Center of the Earth (not Jules Verne’s version but rather a 1741 book written by Norwegian writer Ludvig Holberg), continuing up to the contemporary era with mappings of Octavia Butler’s life and works and artist David Lilburn’s 2006 mapping of James Joyce’s Ulysses. “This exhibition explores the question of what is augmented or diminished by reading a narrative with a map,” said exhibition curator Karla Nielsen to the Guardian. “Are the text and the map competing or complementary? Do the maps interfere with the world being built, or do they help?” Mapping Fictions grew out of Nielsen’s desire to celebrate the centennial of James Joyce’s Ulysses, which was first published in full in 1922 by Sylvia Beach in Paris. As Nielsen explained, over the years the novel has had its own complicated relationship with efforts to map both its physical topography and its imaginative realms. One flashpoint occurred in 1934, when, after years of pirated editions and court battles over the text’s supposed obscenity, Random House at last brought out the first legal American edition of Ulysses. Knowing the reputation of this notably difficult novel, Random House wanted to include in its edition explanatory materials that would map out the novel, making it an easier lift for its first readers. Joyce adamantly resisted, leading to a tense standoff. Eventually they compromised, with Random House releasing a poster that included a map of Dublin, explanations as to how to enjoy Ulysses, and reassurances that the novel made sense. Aware of that history, Nielsen saw an “opportunity to contextualize that moment and the ways Ulysses has been put into book form and mapped”, and thus the seed of Mapping Fictions was planted. Although the exhibition centers around Joyce’s masterpiece, it includes works of various literary genres dating back as far back as the 16th century, as well as various works of art and ephemera, all based on the question of how maps interact with the literary texts that have inspired them. “I wanted to think about how, as the technology changed, the way maps could be put into books changed,” said Nielsen. “For instance, it was in the 19th century that publishers began to think about what you could do with a book cover, if you could put a map on it. As time passed, people began being able to insert maps into multiple places in a book. These sorts of questions are concerned with the materiality of narrative and literature, how the book as a form has managed to organize narrative spatially.” While Joyce was firmly anti-map, other authors shown in Mapping Fictions, including fellow high modernist apostle William Faulkner, had a different perspective. When Random House published Faulkner’s Absalom, Absalom! shortly after Joyce’s Ulysses, the publisher worried that the novel would be too hard to follow and asked Faulkner for a map of Yoknapatawpha county and a genealogy of his characters. The gregarious southerner was more than happy to oblige. He also later made a map of Yoknapatawpha county that charted out his various novels for Viking Press’s edition of The Portable Faulkner, charmingly referring to himself in the map of the county as its “sole owner and proprietor”. Mapping Fictions also features books whose authors downright demanded that maps be included. When Robert Lewis Stevenson’s publisher attempted to bring out his 1886 novel Kidnapped without the author’s map, Stevenson was outraged. “Without the map, Kidnapped didn’t function the way Stevenson wanted it to,” Nielsen said. “He really wanted readers to be able to understand how this kidnapped character was being moved around. Having that topographic awareness as a reader gives you a level of control over the story that the protagonist doesn’t have.” Nielsen’s exhibition offers an intriguing opportunity to meditate on how maps and novels can either function in harmony or get in one another’s way. Both can be seen as ways to organize narratives and make interpretations of reality, and each has its own particular way of achieving these goals. They are at their best when each uses its particular way of seeing to augment the other’s capacity to build worlds and examine our common milieu. In this careful balance, knowing what details to include and which to leave out is crucial. “That’s something about how fictional narrative works,” said Nielsen. “It’s partial. You may not get minute explanations of characters, but that doesn’t mean you don’t experience the character as full. Maps are similar in that they don’t include everything. Both have to answer similar formal questions, like how much detail to include.” Visitors to Mapping Fictions can see for themselves how authors and their publishers have managed these questions within the constraints of form and the technological possibilities of the time. The exhibition provides insight on how, as different novelistic styles, genres and methods of production have risen to prominence, they have enabled their own particular way of creating fictional terrain. These fictional worlds have, in turn, shaped our perceptions of the places we inhabit. “Our realities are world-building projects,” said Nielsen. “We make the world out of our perceptions and the categories we build. In the 18th century, for instance, maps and novels were fulfilling a curiosity about the bigger world of things and other people’s movements. In the 19th, many readers experienced westward expansion through Mark Twain’s chronicles of his life story. Emerging understandings of these places were enabled through imaginative narrative.” It’s a process that continues to this day. Mapping Fictions includes two maps that visitors can try out for themselves: one of the Huntington’s Chinese garden, which puts into space many important moments from Chinese history, and one of Octavia Butler’s Pasadena, which is a short drive from the Huntington. It also features contemporary works like Karen Tei Yamashita’s 1997 novel Tropic of Orange, which Nielsen says gives a “blimp’s-eye view of Los Angeles.” “I think it’s important to put out contemporary books too,” said Nielsen, “so people can come in and say, ‘oh wow, I have that book!’” Mapping Fictions is on display at The Huntington Library’s West Hall until 2 May",Arts/Books,Mapping fictions: the complicated relationship between authors and literary maps,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/19/mapping-fictions-relationship-authors-literary-maps
1/19/2022,"Morrisons has announced that it will slash sick pay for unvaccinated workers, claiming it is removing the allowance in order to encourage unvaccinated workers to get the jab and boost vaccination rates. Unvaccinated staff employed by the grocery giant will no longer be entitled to more than the legal minimum of £96.35 a week in statutory sick pay if they are instructed to self-isolate by test and trace but test negative for Covid. Morrisons joins a growing list of corporations – including Next, Ikea, Ocado and Wessex Water – in claiming that cutting sick pay will increase vaccine uptake.  Rather than buying into this misguided sense of unity, I’m left with a growing sense of unease about the implications of weaponising a public health goal to reduce sick payments for low-wage staff. Condemning staff to survive on less than £100 a week won’t teach anyone a lesson about the importance of the vaccine. Instead, it risks plunging workers into financial hardship, with some reluctant to declare they have been forced to self-isolate for fear of losing out on vital cash. If we have learned anything from the pandemic, it’s that the lack of a robust safety net for workers has already exacerbated Covid transmission. Further cutting pay is no solution. It’s common knowledge that statutory sick pay is not enough for any worker to live on, and these companies know this. Even Matt Hancock, the former health secretary, said that he couldn’t live on £96.35 a week. As nothing has been done to make this amount liveable amid the worst health crisis in a generation, millions of the UK’s lowest-paid workers have been reliant on that amount if they have to self-isolate over the course of the pandemic, if they are entitled to it at all. From a public health perspective, it’s nothing short of a disaster. The Trades Union Congress called the decision to strip statutory sick pay from workers an “own goal”, one that will drive up transmission rates because workers cannot survive on sick pay rates and may continue to work rather than take inadequate pay. Government polling during the January 2021 lockdown found that only 17% of people with symptoms were getting tested, while 15% continued going to work despite needing to self-isolate, with signs pointing to the low levels of sick pay driving staff back to work early. It’s also an insulting way to thank supermarket staff who have borne the brunt of the virus while many of us had the luxury of working from home. Tasked with working through successive lockdowns amid soaring transmission rates, workers were encouraged to remain on the shop floor with limited protections from the virus. Despite rhetoric lionising “key workers” throughout the pandemic, supermarket staff dealt with record levels of abuse from customers – who were encouraged, but not required, to wear masks in shops. While the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers campaigned to install further protections for workers from abuse, no additional legal protections were put in place, leading the British Medical Journal to conclude shop workers were five times more likely to contract coronavirus than the average person. Now that companies wish to recoup their profits as they deal with spiralling absences caused by the Omicron variant, the health and wellbeing of workers has been curiously pushed up the agenda. While these companies claim they are on a public-health crusade to boost vaccine uptake among their workforce, the idea that they are doing it with workers’ benefit in mind is a hard sell. A decision to cut sick pay ultimately saves companies money. It’s something Morrisons chief executive David Potts recognised when he first announced the statutory sick pay policy in a call with investors in September as part of a group of measures to limit “biblical costs” imposed by the pandemic. It’s also a fact recognised by retail giant Next, which agreed that while vaccine uptake is an “emotive topic”, it clarified that its decision was made to “balance staff and shareholder needs” as the resurgence of the Omicron variant has left shops paying out sick pay packages above and beyond any figures we have seen in our lifetime. It’s clear that the anti-vaccination movement has thrived in a culture of distrust. Organisations reversing their obligations because they disagree with a worker’s decision – no matter how legitimate – will deepen this divide, and risk making martyrs out of workers who refuse to get the vaccine as the clampdown begins. Getting vaccination rates up may be a worthy goal, but using price discipline on low-wage workers is a sinister and regressive way to go about it.

1/19/2022,"Depending on who you talk to, professional golf has either never had it so good or is on the brink of being torn apart by Saudi Arabians bearing gifts. The proposed Saudi-backed Super Golf League would bestow millions on those willing to break from established tours. It is the talk of the range at Yas Links as the European Tour – now DP World Tour – season gets under way and where Rory McIlroy, Collin Morikawa and Viktor Hovland head a stellar field. McIlroy has long since made clear his disdain for all things Saudi. His commitment instead is to this and the PGA Tour. On the eve of his restart, the Northern Irishman made the case for golf in existing form. “Honestly, I don’t think it [the European Tour] has ever been in a healthier position,” McIlroy said. “I think the alliance with the PGA Tour is massive.  “Think of the young players that are coming through. That the first American ever won the Race to Dubai last year in Collin Morikawa and you have these young players coming through from either side of the pond that want to play over here and travel. “Look, the one disappointment for every European golf fan was the Ryder Cup last year. But I think it’s never been healthier. The tournaments are getting bigger. Sponsorship dollars are coming in to support events. Players are wanting to come back and play. I think it’s in a really good spot.” McIlroy’s point is backed up by $8m (£5.8m) prize purses both at this tournament and next week’s Dubai Desert Classic. Whistling Straits and a Ryder Cup thumping at the hands of the United States saw McIlroy reduced to tears of frustration. Detailed European assessment of what precisely went wrong in Wisconsin means a captaincy successor to Padraig Harrington being named appears some way off. Luke Donald and Henrik Stenson lead that particular race. McIlroy rebounded impressively from team trauma with a win in Las Vegas before 2021 closed. He has resumed his alliance with his childhood coach, Michael Bannon, but insists his biggest challenge comes “between the ears”. “Over the years I’ve learned when you get to this level there’s so many different ways to swing a golf club and everyone is trying to be somewhat perfect. You just have to know what you do well and just try to repeat that. “It’s about creating a repeatable swing. It doesn’t have to be absolutely by the book and perfect but the more optimal you can be between the ears, that’s where you’re going to pick up shots and that’s the difference between winning and losing tournaments. That’s something that I continually, like everyone, just have to try to work on and become better at. “I definitely feel like I turned a corner after the Ryder Cup. I think anyone that was paying attention saw I played better those few events I played after the Ryder Cup and it’s just trying to continue on what I’ve been working on since then. Trying to eliminate the big miss off the tee, those destructive shots where you make doubles from, rein that in a little bit and getting more effective with the scoring clubs.” Tyrrell Hatton, the defending champion, admitted his attitude let him down during much of 2021. “I was doing no training, wasn’t that motivated to practise either,” said the Englishman. “It’s not always plain sailing. So I flew out to Orlando on New Year’s Eve and tried a two-week boot camp of training and practise. I found the motivation to go and do it.”",Sport/Sport,‘I’ve turned a corner since Ryder Cup’: Rory McIlroy raring to go in Abu Dhabi,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/jan/19/rory-mcilroy-golf-abu-dhabi-dp-world-tour
1/19/2022,"Women’s rights activists are at the high court to argue that the police’s decision to ban a vigil for Sarah Everard in London was a breach of their human rights. The Metropolitan police were criticised last March after using force to break up the vigil on Clapham Common, close to where Everard, 33, was kidnapped by Wayne Couzens, an officer in an elite Met police firearms unit, then murdered.  The event had initially been called by members of Reclaim These Streets (RTS), but they pulled out after police told them it would be an illegal gathering under coronavirus lockdown regulations in place at the time, and threatened them with £10,000 fines. In the ensuing outcry, RTS raised tens of thousands of pounds to fund a judicial review of the Met’s decision to ban the protest. At a two-day hearing starting on Wednesday at the high court in London, they will argue that the Met breached rights guaranteed to them under the Human Rights Act. Before the hearing, Anna Birley, one of four claimants in the case, said: “We feel that they did not take into account our human rights under articles 10 and 11 – freedom of expression and the right to protest – when they called our vigil unlawful. “What we didn’t want was that to set a precedent for the police to decide which protests they agreed with and which protests they didn’t. So we hope that the case will set a useful precedent that helps to protect protest rights – and make sure that women’s voices aren’t silenced in the future.” In the divisional court, Lord Justice Warby and Mr Justice Holgate will hear that police failed to take into account an earlier ruling that there could be “reasonable excuse” under coronavirus regulations for gatherings engaging those rights. The Met admitted it did not consider such an excuse, RTS claims. Instead the force “adopted the stance that the proposed gathering was unlawful and that they should actively deter those organising it and attending it from doing so”, according to a legal briefing by the group. RTS said that if the judicial review were successful it would set a precedent that police could not use decisions made in parliament to “to evade their human rights responsibilities”. Birley added: “There are some really pernicious measures being proposed that will result in police having a lot more powers to limit protesters’ rights. What we hope is that the precedent we hope is set today and tomorrow in the court case will ensure that those protections for protest rights are clearly set out.” The Met said it was defending itself. In a statement, the force said: “We do not believe our approach was founded on an inaccurate interpretation of the regulations or that this constituted an unlawful interference with the claimants’ rights. Throughout the pandemic, officers worked to balance the need to safeguard the public at large from Covid, with the rights of individuals protected by the Human Rights Act 1998. “Policing of public order events is highly complex and is one of the most scrutinised areas of law enforcement. We believe we are world leaders in this area.” RTS first took legal action in March last year, asking a high court judge to make “an interim declaration” that any ban on outdoor gatherings under the coronavirus regulations at the time was “subject to the right to protest”. But the judge declined to grant the group’s request and also refused to make a declaration that an alleged force policy of “prohibiting all protests, irrespective of the specific circumstances” was unlawful.",News/World news,High court to hear claims Sarah Everard vigil ban breached human rights,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/19/high-court-hear-claims-sarah-everard-vigil-ban-breached-human-rights-met-police
1/19/2022,"One of the ugliest and most fatuous chapters in Home Office history arrived in 2013, when under the auspices of the then home secretary Theresa May, vans toured London areas with high immigrant populations displaying the sign: “In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest.” Of course, this ridiculous piece of toxic bossiness was not really addressed to illegal immigrants: Home Office officials were well aware that they themselves would be unable or unwilling to respond. It was a piece of taxpayer-funded party-political posturing, dogwhistling or humanwhistling to the bigots and intended as part of a charmless new policy of “hostile environment” – making things unpleasant in the country generally, a way of trying to pressure people to leave of their own free will. Sonita Gale’s interesting and highly pertinent documentary is about how that nasty little malaise spread outwards, but is coming to a crisis now that Brexit has brought it home to the governing classes just how reliant our service industry is on casual labour, and how reliant the NHS is on immigrants. Many of these are former students applying for leave to remain, but have thereby been denied public funds, and so were ineligible for furlough payments or any support as the lockdown hit. It has meant utter poverty and Kafkaesque bureaucracy – for once, that adjective really is justified.  And this brings us to the other, truly sinister part of this story, uncovered by Gale’s film: the staggering sums of money charged directly to the immigrants themselves, thousands of pounds simply to make these applications, far in excess of any conceivable administration costs – again, a hostile state-mugging of otherwise innocent people, a deliberate use of deterrent pauperisation.

1/19/2022,"Ian McEwan’s “most epic book to date”, moving from the end of the second world war to the current pandemic and exploring the impact of childhood trauma, will be published this autumn. The Booker prize-winning author of Amsterdam, Atonement, and most recently Brexit satire The Cockroach, will release his new novel Lessons this September. McEwan’s publisher Jonathan Cape described it as “a powerful meditation on history and humanity told through the prism of one man’s lifetime”.  It follows protagonist Roland Baines from his time at an “unusual” boarding school at the age of 11, when his vulnerability attracts piano teacher Miss Miriam Cornell, to the disappearance of his wife, leaving him to care for his young son alone. Cape said the novel sees the author explore what can be learned from the traumas of the past, what parenthood can teach us about ourselves, and how global events “shape our lives and memories”. “Haunted by lost opportunities, [Roland] seeks solace through every possible means – music, literature, family, friends, sex, politics and love,” said Cape. Publishing director Michal Shavit, who acquired the novel, called it “not only [McEwan’s] most epic book to date”, but also “one of, if not, his finest”. “A universal story of love, acceptance and sacrifice, longing, desire and of harm in childhood and its long term impact,” she said. “Set against the most amazing backdrop of world defining events, this is the story of an extraordinary century and an ordinary man grappling with all that it is to be human.”",Arts/Books,Ian McEwan’s ‘most epic book to date’ to be published in September,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/19/ian-mcewan-most-epic-book-to-be-published-in-september-lessons
1/19/2022,"Baked beans, but not as we know them – for all the tales of Native Americans “gifting” the notion to early European immigrants, there is (as yet) no evidence of them cooking beans in this way, and Keith Stavely and Kathleen Fitzgerald’s America’s Founding Food suggests that the “immediate progenitor” of this New England classic is more likely to have been a ham-flavoured pease pottage from Old England.  Whatever the truth, however, the beans – and the molasses used to flavour them – make this an indisputably American dish, and a useful one for those Puritans who kept the Sabbath holy, because it could be prepared on a Saturday and, according to Eleanor Early’s 1954 New England Cookbook, taken from the oven on Sunday morning for breakfast, before being returned there to keep warm for their return from church. The mind boggles to think of the cumulative effect of such a bean-heavy diet on a household, but at least these baked beans, sweet from molasses, tangy with cider vinegar and rich with pork fat, are more of a balanced meal than our own beloved turquoise tins – rather like an American cassoulet, in fact, and just as worthy of your time in the kitchen. Though, actually, the oven does most of the work. Let’s start with the easy bit. Early mentions tend to be fairly non-specific as to which variety to use, though white peas and navy beans pop up in a few examples. Joe Yonan, who includes his own version of “an old Vermont family recipe” for New England baked beans in his book Cool Beans, prefers, “Jacob’s cattle or other plump, creamy beans, such as … borlotti or pinto”. Unsurprisingly, they’re fairly interchangeable after so long in the oven, so use whatever you have to hand. The question of preparation is a more interesting one. Most writers soak the beans in cold water before use, so when I see that Yonan skips this step, I’m so unnerved I contact him on Twitter to check I’ve not missed anything. He confirms he rarely bothers unless he’s not sure how old the beans are: “It usually doesn’t speed things up enough to make it worth it, and I get more flavour and colour in the beans when I skip it.” He does, however, suggest adding kombu, or dried kelp, which, I learn from Cook’s Illustrated magazine, apparently “neutralises difficult-to-digest small carbohydrates in beans” and, as a rich source of glutamates, “boosts bean flavour [and] also improves texture: pinto beans soaked and then cooked in water with a strip of kombu had soft skins and smooth interiors; soaked beans cooked in water alone were more grainy and tough”. This is, apparently, because the seaweed’s “sodium and potassium ions trade places with minerals in the beans to create a smoother, creamier consistency”. All you really need to know, though, is that it works. If you don’t happen to have kombu handy and don’t want to buy any for future bean cooking (it keeps for ages), then both Cook’s Illustrated (CI) and Yonan recommend soaking them with a tablespoon of coarse salt instead. Rather than making them tough, as culinary lore suggests, “the sodium in the salt solution replaces some of the calcium and magnesium in the bean skins, making them more permeable and resulting in more tender beans inside and out”. Less scientifically, but equally usefully, Florence Brobeck’s 1937 New York Times piece on “Yankee cooks” explains that “any old-fashioned cook knows that the only way to tell when [the beans are softened] is to lift out a spoonful … and blow on them. If they’re done, the pale shells blow off.” At this point, you’re ready to turn down the heat and slow-cook them, just like those Sabbath-keeping Puritans. (If you’re absolutely desperate for Boston baked beans, and don’t have a few hours to play with, you could do worse than trying the recipe using tinned beans in The Joy of Cooking, which requires only an hour in the oven – they lack the depth of flavour of the slow-braised variety, but they’re still pretty good.) Early colonists had to stretch a little protein a long way, so the meat in Boston baked beans tends to be a fairly minor element, albeit one with a disproportionate importance to the finished dish, because the salt pork or bacon melts its fatty, savoury flavour into the sauce, which means Yonan has a challenge on his hands to make it plant-based. He gets away with it thanks to the judicious application of smoked paprika, though we do think his beans would be even better with a knob of butter (or some oil) stirred in at the end. If you do eat meat, however, this is a very good dish to make the most of minimal amounts of it. As CI observes, salt pork, the traditional choice, can be so mild as to be underwhelming, while their testers found that smoked bacon was “too smoky and overwhelming” on its own – the two together, they decided, gave the perfect combination of heartiness and richness. As salt pork is not easily obtainable in the UK, I make a slab of my own from pork belly, a process that takes four days. Having done this, I feel able confidently to assure you that fat green streaky bacon makes a very good substitute – I don’t think you need the smoked sort, either, though feel free to use it instead if you prefer. More important, in my opinion, is how you distribute it. Most recipes call for it to be cut into chunks, which dry out and disappear after so long in the oven, but Brobeck leaves it in a single slab, and “nestles” it amid the beans, so it ends up deliciously soft and tender, but still recognisably bacon. That said, many rashers are now cut so thinly that you may need to go to a butcher who slices their own, or make some salt pork, or stick a few slices together and hope for the best. Onion, though “a controversial ingredient in classic recipes”, according to CI, adds savoury balance to the sweetness of the mandatory molasses, so I’ll be including it – though, again, rather than chopping it into small pieces and browning it first, I’ll be adding it in halves, so it infuses the sauce. This saves you dicing something that, after five hours in the oven, is unlikely to be recognisable anyway, and also, I think, gives a more oniony end result. We all prefer the heat of mustard to the faintly British-tasting sweet-and-sour ketchup in The Joy of Cooking recipe. I’m unable to track down any brown mustard, which CI recommends for “imparting a pleasant sharpness without drawing attention to itself” – it seems to have disappeared from shelves here – so I try wholegrain instead, but, as with Daniel Gritzer’s take for Serious Eats, which uses tangy dijon, I miss the fire of the English mustard in Yonan and Brobeck’s recipes. That said, I like wholegrain enough to add a little at the end instead, along with the cider vinegar essential for cutting through the sugar of the molasses. As for those molasses, which is the ingredient that gives New England baked beans their characteristic bittersweet note, it’s easily found in healthfood shops and online, but you can substitute the more one-dimensional treacle if you don’t want to invest in a jar. Yonan also uses maple syrup, but I’d prefer my beans to be less sweet than most modern versions; Lydia Maria Child’s 1832 recipe makes no mention of sweeteners, while Amanda Hesser, editor of The Essential New York Times Cookbook, notes that Brobeck’s recipe isn’t “nearly as sweet and syrupy” as “cloying modern baked beans … [with] an actual balance of sweet and savoury”, which is exactly why I enjoy it so much. If you’re not adding meat, you may wish, like Yonan, to up the spice content: he adds ginger and the aforementioned smoked paprika, but it strikes me that cloves would be good, too, as would the all-American chilli pepper. With such a simple dish, the method is all-important. CI writes that, “to a certain extent, flavour and texture [are] in opposition. The longer the beans cook, the better the sauce’s flavour, but past a certain crucial moment of equilibrium, time works against the beans, turning them into mush”. The best way to deal with this is to cook the beans fast (either in the oven or on the hob), and then turn the heat right down and braise them until soft and creamy. Personally, I don’t mind if a few disintegrate to thicken the sauce, but they should still be loose, rather than a starchy mush. On which note, do not throw away the bean cooking liquid and replace it with fresh water, as Brobeck suggests – Gritzer nails it when he calls this “a terrible idea. That bean water is loaded with bean starch and flavour, two things you absolutely want to keep in the bean pot.” You should, however, drain off any excess before moving on to the second stage: for maximum flavour, the beans should at all times be barely covered. Once they are done, however, you can remove the lid and leave the sauce to reduce. Serve with brown bread and pickles, to be true to Brobeck’s recipe, or “over-roasted potatoes and with a garden-fresh salad”, as Yonan recommends for a “true Maine homesteaders’ meal”. Just don’t tell the folks in Boston. Prep 5 minCook 5 hrServes 6-8 450g small dried beans1 strip of kombu2 tsp English mustard powder, made up with a little cold water1 tsp salt3 tbsp molasses225g unsmoked streaky bacon, preferably in one thick slab1 onion, peeled and cut in half1 tbsp cider vinegar1 tbsp wholegrain mustard (optional) Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the beans in an ovenproof pot for which you have a lid and add cold water to cover by about 4cm. Add the kombu and bring up to a simmer on the hob (alternatively, do this in a saucepan and transfer to an ovenproof dish afterwards). Cover the pan, transfer to the oven and bake for 60-90 minutes, until the beans are soft and the skins come away when you blow on them. Turn down the oven to 150C (130C fan)/300F/gas 2. Drain enough liquid from the beans into another container until what’s left in the pan comes just above the level of the beans, then stir the English mustard, salt and molasses into the beans. Push the bacon, skin side up if it still has its rind, and the onion cut side down into the beans, cover again and bake for three to four hours longer, until the beans are creamy and soft; if at any stage the beans look like they’re drying out, use the reserved drained liquor to top them up as necessary. Once the beans are done, take off the lid and put back in the oven for a final 45-60 minutes, until the sauce is thick. Stir in the vinegar and wholegrain mustard, if using, then season to taste, adding more molasses if you’d like it sweeter.

1/19/2022,"The Tory MP Christian Wakeford has defected to Labour, piling more pressure on Boris Johnson as growing numbers within his own party call on the prime minister to resign. Just minutes before prime minister’s questions, Wakeford – elected as the MP for Bury South in 2019 – crossed the floor to sit with Keir Starmer’s party, declaring in a letter to Johnson resigning the Conservative whip that he was “incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves”.  The move will prove a huge embarrassment for Johnson, who is fighting to avoid enough of his own backbenchers submitting letters calling for a no-confidence vote. Fifty-four are needed to trigger a ballot. Many of those who have written a letter are members of the 2019 intake, like Wakeford. He submitted a letter last week. In a letter to Johnson released on Wednesday afternoon, Wakeford said he believed “the policies of the Conservative government that you lead are doing nothing to help the people of my constituency and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse”. Raising concerns about the “cost of living crisis” and how the country should emerge from the Covid pandemic, Wakeford said the UK needed “a government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public life”. He added: “Sadly, both you and the Conservative party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves.” Wakeford said he was in “no doubt” his constituents would be best served “by my joining a party that genuinely has their interests at heart”, and admitted he had “wrestled with my conscience for many months”. But he said the decision was “about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks” during the investigation into alleged rule-breaking parties held in Downing Street and across government. Wakeford said Starmer had “shown that integrity in the way he has led his party on issues that matter to me, not least the vital challenge of combatting antisemitism” and added: “Changes that can only be delivered by a Labour government with Keir Starmer.” To raucous cheers in the Commons chamber, Starmer “warmly welcomed” Wakeford to the opposition benches – gesturing to the MP who was sat directly behind him. “Like so many people up and down the country, he has concluded that the prime minister and the Conservative party have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserved.” Johnson attempted to appear bullish in front of his own MPs, telling them: “The Conservative party won Bury South for the first time in generations under this prime minister, with an agenda of uniting and levelling up and delivering for the people of BS, and we will win again in BS at the next election under this prime minister.”",News/Politics,"Tory MP Christian Wakeford defects to Labour, blaming PM’s ‘disgraceful’ conduct ",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/19/tory-mp-christian-wakeford-has-defected-to-labour-says-starmer
1/19/2022,"Good morning. There is good news from New York City and some north-eastern US states which appear to have recorded rapid decreases in their numbers of Covid-19 cases in recent days, raising the possibility that the Omicron wave has already peaked in some parts of America.  The rolling seven-day average of new cases in New York City was below 28,000 a day on 16 January, down from an average of more than 40,000 on 9 January. Similar patterns have been observed in the state as a whole and other nearby regions. “The Covid forecast is improving … the Covid clouds are parting,” the New York governor, Kathy Hochul, said in a statement Sunday after releasing figures that showed positivity rates in the state are falling sharply. “Overall, the prognosis, the forecast, for Covid is much brighter than it had been before.” How many cases are there in New York? About 400,000 tests were conducted in New York on Saturday, with a positivity rate of 12.9%. The rate was almost 20% a week ago based on a similar number of tests. Michelle Gotthelf, a former senior New York Post editor, has launched legal action accusing the tabloid’s longtime editor-in-chief, Col Allan, of sexually harassing and verbally abusing her, including propositioning her for sex. In a complaint filed in the US federal court system on Tuesday, Gotthelf accused the Post’s owner, News Corp, Allan and the paper’s current editor-in-chief, Keith Poole, of breaching New York employment law by discriminating against her on the basis of her sex and retaliating against her when she complained. She also claimed Allan had intervened in coverage of Donald Trump, demanding a story about the then-president being accused of rape be removed from the paper’s website, of which she was editor-in-chief, and calling the complaint “baseless shit”. What sparked the legal action? Gotthelf said Poole had fired her last week, ending her 20-year career at News Corp. She alleges Allan created a hostile work environment for her. What else does she say in the lawsuit? The sexual harassment allegedly peaked in 2015 when she alleged that Allan had propositioned her for sex, saying: “We should sleep together”. Her rejection allegedly resulted in Allan becoming more abusive. What has Allan said? The Guardian has been unable to contact Allan for comment. A spokeswoman for News Corp and The Post said in a statement: “Any suggestion of wrongdoing related to the management changes announced today is meritless.” André Leon Talley, the influential fashion journalist and former editor-at-large of US Vogue under Anna Wintour, has died at the age of 73. TMZ reported that Talley had died of an unknown illness at New York hospital on Tuesday. His death was later confirmed by his literary agent, David Vigliano. A larger-than-life character – and six foot seven inches tall – Talley was a pioneering figure in the fashion world, as known for his biting comments and flamboyant presence as the statement kaftans, hats and robes he frequently wore. In a career that spanned six decades, Talley used his position to champion diversity on the runway and behind the scenes in the fashion world. What have people said in tribute? The designer Diane von Furstenberg, a close friend, said: “No one saw the world in a more glamorous way than you did. No one was grander and more soulful than you were.” Australia and New Zealand have started to dispatch aid to Tonga, despite fears that relief workers could bring a “tsunami of Covid” cases to the Pacific Island nation that has so far recorded just one case of the virus. The US congressional committee investigating the Capitol attack has issued a blitz of subpoenas to some of Donald Trump’s top lawyers, including Rudy Giuliani, Boris Epshteyn, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis. A 14-year old indigenous activist has been murdered in Colombia, prompting shock and horror at the latest in a spate of killings of environmentalists and social leaders in the country. Breiner David Cucuñame was shot dead on Friday. Healthcare workers and first responders are displaying post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms like veterans who served in combat, recent research indicates, and experts say many could leave the profession as a result of their experiences. Nobody was talking much about Oscars when Spider-Man: No Way Home was released in cinemas last month, but it was easy enough to see that they soon would be. The film swung onto screens as a pre-ordained saviour of cinema, the hopes of an industry pinned on its well-worn spandex bodysuit. By the end of December, the film’s formal Oscar campaign for best picture had been launched, reigniting a debate over what kind of film the academy should be rewarding. Expanding national parks and protected areas will not be enough to halt the destruction of nature, and urgent action on overconsumption, harmful subsidies and the climate crisis is also required to halt biodiversity loss, leading scientists say. Governments are expected to commit to a Paris-style agreement for nature at Cop 15 in Kunming, China, later this year, but experts say the plan falls short.

1/19/2022,"Mark Zuckerberg has a fascination with ancient Rome, but last week a court decision threatened the future of another empire: his own. Judge James Boasberg said the US competition watchdog can pursue the break up of Meta – the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp – paving the way for a costly and lengthy legal battle. Boasberg had dismissed the Federal Trade Commission’s first attempt in June, but this time he was swayed by a revised FTC complaint under its new chair, Lina Khan.  As the judge stressed in his 48-page decision, it is “anyone’s guess” whether the FTC will win its case against a $920bn (£675bn) business that can afford very decent lawyers. Boasberg, a Washington-based district judge who hears cases under federal law, has simply ruled that the FTC has a “plausible claim” under the Sherman Act, which prevents monopolistic companies from ripping off consumers. Even so, Boasberg has given the FTC’s case a boost. He is allowing the claim to proceed even though Meta operates in what competition experts call a zero-price market. As billions of people around the world know, Meta’s services are free – how can consumers in the US be harmed economically by a service they don’t pay for? The FTC argues that by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta stifled competition and ended up giving a poor deal to consumers in the market for “personal social networking” services. It argues that the acquisition of these companies was anticompetitive because it led to poorer service – for instance lower levels of service quality in privacy and data protection – and less choice for consumers. On the latter, the FTC cites the fact that Meta (then Facebook Inc) shut down an app designed to compete with Instagram once it had bought the photo sharing service in 2012. The complaint also alleges that Meta benefits from barriers to entry in the social networking market such as high switching costs, ie the difficulty of moving to a new social network and taking all your photos and associated data with you. Meta their match Rebecca Allensworth, professor of law at Vanderbilt University in the US, says the decision is “a really bad sign” for Meta. “I think the judge sounded very approving of all the arguments made by the FTC. At the same time, it’s the beginning of the beginning [of the case].” Allensworth added that it was a “big win” for the FTC that Boasberg accepted a more subjective definition of competition in the social media market, instead of expecting the watchdog to crunch through economic data. The FTC has also peppered its complaint with quotes from Meta executives, which Boasberg picks up on. For instance, Boasberg refers to statements made by Zuckerberg about Meta’s structural advantages in the market. He also refers to an email in which the Meta founder states that it is “better to buy than compete.” Boasberg’s decision carries a Zuckerberg quote stating that he saw messaging as a threat and would pay $1bn for WhatsApp “if he could get them” (he ultimately paid $19bn for the business in 2014). The complaint states that Meta’s share of the personal social networking services market has not dropped below 70% in the US since 2016 and is now as high as 80% on smartphones. “Facebook [Inc]’s market share comfortably exceeds the levels that courts ordinarily find sufficient to establish monopoly power,” wrote Boasberg. However, nothing has been proven yet. Whether Meta is indeed a monopoly, and commits anticompetitive harm from this position will be settled at the end of the formal legal contest that is about to unfold. Kind of a big deal The next stage for the FTC is a process known as discovery, where it seeks evidence from Meta to back up its case. The burden of proof in this lawsuit is on the FTC, which means it must seek documents from the company it is accusing of anti-competitive behaviour in order to prove that its accusations are correct. This stage – where the FTC makes document requests and Meta no doubt challenges them – could take some time. After the discovery process, the FTC might seek a summary judgment in its favour – as Meta may, too – but it is possible in such a weighty, complex case that the judge will send it for a full-blown trial. And even if the FTC wins at any of these stages, Meta will have recourse to an appeals process. As a result, any FTC-led breakup process could take years. Allensworth acknowledges that Boasberg’s ruling is a “big deal” and says Meta is certainly a break-up candidate because it has units that can be hived off, but there is a long way to go. “I hate to make a prediction about whether or not a break-up will or won’t happen. Obviously, having your suit not dismissed is a necessary – but not sufficient – step in the direction of being broken up. But to say ‘they need to be shaking in their boots about being broken up at this point’ is definitely more than we can really say about the suit right now.” The wrath of Khan Meta responded to the decision by pointing out that Boasberg had rejected one element of the complaint. Boasberg said the FTC could not press allegations that Facebook blocked competing apps from accessing its platform as a way to maintain its dominance, saying the policies had been abandoned in 2018. Meta added: “We’re confident the evidence will reveal the fundamental weakness of the claims. Our investments in Instagram and WhatsApp transformed them into what they are today. They have been good for competition, and good for the people and businesses that choose to use our products.” Barry Lynn, executive director of the Washington-based Open Markets Institute, which researches the impact of monopolies and how to strengthen competition policy, says a break-up will weaken Mark Zuckerberg’s empire. “The power of the corporation vis-a-vis the government, vis-a-vis advertisers and vis-a-vis users becomes much less because you have broken it into three parts. The final few pages of the Boasberg decision deal with Meta’s attempts to have Khan, the chair of the FTC, withdrawn from the case for various reasons which include her having advised a Congress committee – before she was appointed to the FTC – that Meta had broken the Sherman Act. Boasberg dismissed this, saying that Khan’s role in the case is more prosecutor than judge and that people in that position are allowed to show some zeal in enforcing the law. Khan used to work for Lynn at the OMI, as its legal director. Asked if Khan has the determination to win the case, Lynn says: “absolutely.” If you want to read the complete version of the newsletter please subscribe to receive TechScape in your inbox every Wednesday.",News/Technology,TechScape: The US government may be one step closer to breaking up Meta,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/19/techscape-breaking-up-meta
1/19/2022,"A cross-party committee of councillors is to decide the future of the Sheffield city council chief executive, Kate Josephs, a week after she apologised for having leaving drinks in Whitehall during lockdown. Josephs led the government’s Covid-19 taskforce from July to December 2020. After details of the gathering emerged in the media she released a statement admitting it took place and saying she was “truly sorry”.  Sheffield city council, her current employer, said a committee of councillors would be set up “to consider what steps, if any, should be taken next”. Terry Fox, the leader of Sheffield city council, said: “I have heard strong and emotional views from across the city. I absolutely understand the reaction after all that Sheffield has been through these last couple of years. “We now need to let the committee carry out this work and we also continue to await the outcome of the Cabinet Office’s wider report. There is nothing further to add at this time.” The council said there was a prescribed statutory procedure for roles at this level in local government, which meant it had to be dealt with by a cross-party committee. Josephs, it said, had this week taken a short period of annual leave. There is no deadline for the committee to report. “We expect the committee to begin work in the coming days,” the council said. “While we cannot yet know how long it will take, we expect it to move at pace. We expect that it will also take in the findings of the Sue Gray report.” Josephs’ leaving drinks gathering was attended by dozens of officials from the Cabinet Office’s Covid-19 taskforce. On the day it was held the government’s official Twitter feed replied to a query asking if employers could hold Christmas parties at the end of the working day. The feed said: “Hi Mick, although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” In her statement Josephs, who was director general of the taskforce, said of the leaving drinks gathering: “I am truly sorry that I did this and for the anger that people will feel as a result. Sheffield has suffered greatly during this pandemic and I apologise unreservedly.”",News/UK news,Sheffield council to decide fate of chief Kate Josephs following lockdown drinks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/jan/19/sheffield-council-to-decide-fate-of-chief-kate-josephs-following-lockdown-drinks
1/19/2022,"Historians have voiced their scepticism about a book that has identified a Jewish notary as the prime suspect for the betrayal of Anne Frank and her family to the Nazis. The Betrayal of Anne Frank, by Rosemary Sullivan, based on research gathered by retired FBI detective Vince Pankoke was published on Tuesday by HarperCollins with some fanfare.  A CBS 60 Minutes programme on Sunday evening highlighted the book’s tentative findings which were widely covered in the media, including the Guardian. But researchers have now raised doubts about the central theory that Arnold van den Bergh, who died of throat cancer in 1950, probably led the police to the Frank family’s hiding place above a canal-side warehouse in the Jordaan area of Amsterdam on 4 August 1944. The book claimed that as a member of the Jewish council in Amsterdam, an administrative body the German authorities forced Jews to establish, van den Bergh would have had access to the places in which Jewish people were hiding. But David Barnouw, a Dutch author of the 2003 book Who Betrayed Anne Frank?, said he was not convinced. He said: “The researchers rightly subject their findings to all sorts of caveats. However, they are very firm in their conviction of that poor notary. While I wonder whether he had access to a list of Jewish hiding places. The Jewish Council was far too law-abiding to make such a list, I think.” The book, a result of a six-year investigation, suggests that van den Bergh, who acted as notary in the forced sale of works of art to prominent Nazis such as Hermann Göring, had been forced by risks to his own life to use addresses of hiding places as a form of life insurance for his family. Neither he nor his daughter were deported to the Nazi camps. The investigators said they had found references to addresses being kept by the Jewish council. A further key piece of evidence was said to have been an anonymous note delivered after the war to Anne’s father, Otto Frank, the sole survivor among the direct family. The note stated that van den Bergh had given away addresses to the Nazis including that in which Otto, Anne, her mother Edith, sister Margot, Hermann, Auguste and Peter van Pels, and Fritz Pfeffer, had sought to evade capture. The Franks hid for two years in a concealed annexe in the Jordaan area of Amsterdam before their arrest. Ronald Leopold, director of the Anne Frank House, praised the investigation but he also counselled against taking the findings as definitive. He said: “I have great appreciation for the impressive work of the team, the research has been carefully carried out. A lot of new information has been found, sufficient reason to follow the trail of notary van den Bergh. “The most special find is the copy of the note. But many puzzle pieces remain. About the lists that would have been with the Jewish council, about the note and about the notary himself. These are all things that need to be investigated in order to strengthen the credibility of this theory.” Despite a series of investigations, including two by the Dutch police, the mystery of who led the Nazis to the annexe remains unsolved. Otto Frank, who died in 1980, was thought to have a strong suspicion of that person’s identity but he never divulged it in public. Following the arrest of the family, Anne was sent to Westerbork transit camp, and on to Auschwitz concentration camp before finally ending up in Bergen-Belsen, where she died in February 1945 at the age of 15, possibly from typhus. Her published diary spans the period in hiding between 1942 and her last entry on 1 August 1944. Writing in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant, Hanco Jürgens, a research assistant at the Germany Institute Amsterdam, said: “It seems much more likely that the arrest was coincidental. After all, five months earlier, two employees had been arrested for the clandestine trade in coupons. “It could therefore equally be a regular check that resulted in the discovery of the hiding place. The fact that the people in hiding had to wait a long time for an arrest car points to this. But this theory is also based on assumptions.”",Arts/Books,Experts express doubt that Anne Frank was betrayed by a Jewish notary,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/19/experts-express-doubt-that-anne-frank-was-betrayed-by-a-jewish-notary
