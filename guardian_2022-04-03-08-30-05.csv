4/3/2022,"So will the Easter getaway herald the resurrection of British Airways and its owner International Airlines Group (IAG), or will the computer say no? The first big holiday break of the year and the start of the summer season should, according to IAG forecasts, bring a bumper crop of passengers after the grim first two years of the pandemic. The flag carrier expects to fly at full capacity on its most lucrative transatlantic services this summer, and last week returned to some outposts it had deserted at the height of the pandemic: Sydney in Australia, and London’s Gatwick and City airports. But if the fear of Covid – if not the actual rate of infection – is receding, it has become clear that BA has yet to rid its systems of bugs. Customer service has been a recurrent complaint – shedding thousands of staff can’t have helped – and was again put to the test in recent weeks. A series of IT failures led to the airline suffering ripples of apparently self-inflicted cancellations. BA has history with IT problems. Even if Covid has overshadowed any previous nightmares, the reappearance of this particular problem will have agitated investors as well as infuriating passengers. A pandemic is a decent excuse, but BA and IAG have had years to sort out these dodgy tech issues. The biggest failure, in days when such disruptions were front-page news, came five years ago, with thousands of passengers stranded at Heathrow and around the world. The response to the crisis of the then relatively new BA boss Álex Cruz, criticised – fairly or not – as sluggish, appeared to spell the beginning of the end for the Spaniard. The current leadership has seen bigger problems, but solving this one could prove a headache for IAG boss Luis Gallego, who once worked under Cruz in Spain. His predecessor, Willie Walsh, angrily rejected claims that outsourcing the IT had been the problem; a single worker had accidentally tripped the power. With Walsh gone, the hapless engineer who pulled the plug in 2017 is presumably no longer quivering in the toilets. Eighteen months into his tenure, Gallego, obviously less combative and markedly less public, has yet to win over industry observers. But the change at the top underlines that Spain is now officially where the IAG action is, especially since Brexit. IAG insists this issue has long been put to bed, but prominent voices disagree. HSBC analyst Andrew Lobbenberg has not budged from his view that EU ownership and control rules could come back to bite the group, even though IAG wearily repeats that it has done everything necessary to satisfy regulators. Regulators may not be the issue, though. Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary, wickedly stirring the pot last month, said that state-owned rivals Air France-KLM and Lufthansa were still “gunning for the breakup” of IAG, adding: “At European level, whatever the French and Germans want, they get. I think it is inevitable that BA will be forced out of IAG.” An IAG without BA might seem like the Beatles without Lennon and McCartney, but the group’s latest talks have been about bolstering its Madrid hub, with a deal that keeps options open for bid target Air Europa. Madrid is certainly cheaper, as Gallego has noted, than Heathrow, which has pitilessly raised charges. Both Heathrow and IAG have strong links with Qatar, which owns 20% of both, and Qatar Airways has been forging closer operational partnerships with BA. Meanwhile, the backdrop of war in Ukraine and rising jet fuel prices have clouded a summer revival: the Russian invasion sent IAG’s share price to its lowest since 2020. The good news for IAG appears to be that customers are defying predictions that global uncertainty and the spiralling cost of living would dampen demand. This summer, at least, BA planes look set to be filled by Brits who really can’t take it any longer and would rather spend their dwindling pounds on flying abroad than on insane energy bills. With luck, they and IAG will get there.",News/Business,An Easter sunshine rush won’t ensure a bright future for BA,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/03/an-easter-sunshine-rush-wont-ensure-a-bright-future-for-ba
4/3/2022,"An official review is to examine whether food and drink can be fortified with vitamin D to close health inequalities, Sajid Javid has announced. Officials said that the study was being launched following evidence that around one in six adults in the UK has low levels of vitamin D, a deficiency that can lead to conditions such as rickets, disabilities and bone pain. The greater use of supplements will also be examined, with Javid calling on experts and patient groups to come forward with evidence. Almost 20% of children in the UK have vitamin D levels lower than government recommendations. Health officials said that older people, the housebound and people from Black and South Asian communities are also more likely to have lower levels. The new call for evidence is being launched by the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (OHID) and comes ahead of broader proposals for closing health disparities to be published later this year. Official advice states that all adults and children should consider taking a daily 10 micrograms supplement of vitamin D in the darker months between October and March. Other at-risk groups are advised to consider taking a supplement throughout the year. “We must break the link between background and prospects for a healthy life. I am determined to level up the health of the nation and tackle disparities,” Javid said. “People from Black and Asian communities, older people and people who have limited access to the outdoors are more likely to have lower levels of vitamin D, which is essential for bone and muscle health and improving years of life lived in good health. I have launched this call for evidence to identify innovative ways we can encourage people to increase their vitamin D intake and help people live longer, healthier and happier lives.” The study comes after the government opted not to repeat a scheme handing out vitamin D supplements for free to vulnerable people last winter. During the previous year, nearly three million clinically extremely vulnerable people were offered a free four-month course of the supplement. Clinicians were concerned that the group had spent so much time shielding inside that they may be deficient in the vitamin, largely supplied through sunlight. Some groups and MPs have suggested that vitamin D could play a role in combating Covid, as it may play a role in immune response. However, the evidence has been mixed. One assessment of recent trials suggested that there was “no clear, consistent benefit” to the supplement in terms of battling upper respiratory infections. Another looking at healthcare workers suggested it may reduce infection and morbidity.",News/Society,Study to decide whether vitamin D should be added to food ,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/apr/03/study-to-decide-whether-vitamin-d-should-be-added-to-food
