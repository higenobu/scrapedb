5/20/2022,"By Mark Trevelyan LONDON (Reuters) -In a sign of Russia's urgent need to bolster its war effort in Ukraine, parliament said on Friday it would consider a bill to allow Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military. The website of the State Duma, parliament's lower house, said the move would enable the military to utilise the skills of older professionals. ""For the use of high-precision weapons, the operation of weapons and military equipment, highly professional specialists are needed. Experience shows that they become such by the age of 40–45,"" it said. Currently, only Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the military. Russia has suffered huge setbacks and heavy losses of men and equipment in the 86-day-old war, in which Ukraine has mobilised practically its entire adult male population. Despite taking full control of the ruins of Mariupol, Moscow remains far from its objective of seizing all of the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. ""Clearly, the Russians are in trouble. This is the latest attempt to address manpower shortages without alarming their own population. But it is growing increasingly difficult for the Kremlin to disguise their failures in Ukraine,"" said retired U.S. General Ben Hodges, a former commander of U.S. Army forces in Europe. Jack Watling, a land warfare specialist at the British security and defence think tank RUSI, said the Russian military was running short of infantry. ""Russia needs to stabilise manning in its military units in Ukraine and generate new units if it is to improve its position on the ground,"" he said. ""This will be a slow and complicated process, but can be accelerated by mobilising people with existing skills and military experience."" The Duma said the proposed legislation would also make it easier to recruit civilian medics, engineers and operations and communications specialists. Separately, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said on Friday that Russia was forming 12 military units in its western military district in response to rising threats there, citing NATO membership bids by Finland and Sweden.

5/20/2022,"By Andrew MacAskill LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned Britain that there could be no post-Brexit trade deal with the United States if it proceeds with plans to unilaterally scrap some of the rules that govern trade with Northern Ireland. The comments come after Britain warned the European Union this week that it could discard regulations that were painstakingly negotiated with Brussels, including border checks on some goods shipped from mainland Britain to Northern Ireland. The post Brexit trade protocol aims to keep the British-run province, which borders EU member Ireland, in both the United Kingdom's customs territory and the EU's single market. Pelosi said she viewed the existing agreement as essential to maintaining the 1998 peace deal that brought an end to three decades of conflict in Northern Ireland between Catholic nationalist militants and pro-British Protestant ""loyalist"" paramilitaries in which 3,600 people were killed. ""If the United Kingdom chooses to undermine the Good Friday accords, the Congress cannot and will not support a bilateral free trade agreement with the United Kingdom,"" Pelosi said in a statement. Britain says it is acting in the interests of preserving the Good Friday agreement. Northern Ireland remains deeply split along sectarian lines after the 1998 peace deal brokered by the United States. Many Catholic nationalists aspire to unification with Ireland while Protestant unionists want to stay part of the United Kingdom. Britain had viewed a trade deal with the United States as the one of the biggest prizes of leaving the EU but hopes of a quick agreement were dashed when the incoming Biden administration made clear it was not a priority. Any U.S.-British trade agreement would have to pass the U.S. Congress. Pelosi's warning follows a visit to Washington by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's newly appointed special envoy for the Northern Ireland protocol in the United States, Conor Burns, to explain the British position. ""Respectful of the will of the British people and of Brexit, I urge constructive, collaborative and good-faith negotiations to implement an agreement that upholds peace,"" Pelosi said.

5/20/2022,"Vladimir Putin's daughter traveled frequently to Munich between 2017 and 2019, per a joint report. She had a long-term relationship with a former ballet director in the city, per the report. The report provides insight into the lives of Putin's family, which he's fought hard to keep secret. Russian leader Vladimir Putin has long sought to shield his family and children from the public eye, shrouding their identities and whereabouts in secrecy as the West aims to sanction them. Now, new details have emerged about the personal life of one of his two identified daughters thanks to a joint investigation published Thursday by Russian news outlet Important Stories and German news site Der Spiegel. The outlets reported that they obtained flight records showing that Katerina Tikhonova, 35, flew more than 50 times to Munich, Germany, between 2017 and 2019. Their findings also suggest that Tikhonova, thought to be Putin's youngest daughter, is in a serious, long-term relationship with Igor Zelensky, a 52-year-old Russian former ballet star who stepped down as Munich's state ballet director in April. Tikhonova would travel between Moscow and Munich on chartered flights paid for by the state, and with members of Putin's presidential security service, Important Stories reported, citing flight logs and a passenger list. The same list and several passport scans also indicated that Tikhonova and Zelensky had a daughter born in 2017 — around the same time that Tikhonova split from her former husband, Russian businessman Kirill Shamalov. Important Stories said it obtained the passport scans through an email sent between Tikhonova's bodyguard, who booked the tickets, and Russia's presidential security agency. The outlets did not name the couple's daughter but wrote that part of her name is Igorevna, indicating it was derived from Zelensky's first name. The passenger list, which was for a flight on December 9, 2019, showed that Tikhonova and Zelensky landed in Moscow's Vnukovo airport with an entourage of nannies and presidential security, along with their apparent two-year-old daughter and a piano teacher, Important Stories reported. Around this time, Tikhonova seemingly decided to move to Munich, according to a letter in her bodyguard's archives, per the outlet. According to Important Stories, an officer in Russia's presidential security services also received an email in October 2019 titled ""Moving to Germany."" Der Spiegel reported that when it approached Zelensky's residential address in Munich, they found only his ex-wife, former ballet dancer Yana Serebriakova, who refused to answer their questions. Zelensky became the artistic director of Munich's Bavarian State Ballet in 2016 but stepped down on April 4 citing private family circumstances. According to Serge Dorny, the managing director of the Bavarian State Opera, Zelensky was asked to leave for failing to condemn the war in Ukraine publicly. The new details surrounding Tikhonova's penchant for travel to Germany may raise awkward questions for Putin, who's condemned members of the Russian elite who have remained in the West for being ""scum and traitors."" Tikhonova, a former acrobatic dancer, now runs a startup incubator worth $1.7 billion at Moscow State University. In April, the US Treasury Department identified her as one of Putin's daughters as part of the West's sanctions on Russia. Another of Putin's daughters identified by the US is Maria Vorontsova, a 37-year-old pediatric endocrinologist and genetics researcher. She is listed as a leading researcher at the Endocrinology Research Center in Moscow. Its website states that she is also the deputy chairman of the Russian Society of Young Endocrinologists. The whereabouts of Tikhonova, Zelensky, and their purported daughter are currently unknown, Der Spiegel and Important Stories reported.

5/20/2022,"KYIV (Reuters) -Ukraine's territorial defence force said on Wednesday its fighters had blown up an armoured train carrying Russian troops, but an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelinskiy later said the attack had been confined to rails near the train. Reuters could not independently verify the defence force's assertion, posted on Facebook, that it had carried out the attack in the occupied southern Ukrainian city of Melitopol. The city lies in the region of Zaporizhzhia and in a belt of southern Ukrainian land that was occupied by Russian forces after they invaded on Feb. 24. The defence force - the reservist branch of Ukraine's armed forces - said in an online posting that explosives had detonated under a rail car carrying military personnel. It did not elaborate on the extent of the damage. But several hours later, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych gave a conflicting account, saying Ukrainian forces had blown up the tracks ahead of the train. ""The partisans got it, although they did not blow up the armoured train itself,"" he said in a video posted on social media, saying the Russians ""got off lightly."" Arestovych said the incident showed that the partisan movement was actively disrupting Russian forces. Ukrainian news reports say partisans have been operating actively in Melitopol. The town's mayor was taken away by Russian troops for several days in March before being released.
