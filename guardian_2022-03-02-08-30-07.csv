3/2/2022,"Floods are rising in the northern New South Wales town of Ballina, with water expected to reach its highest peak yet due to a king tide. The surge comes after authorities searching homes in Lismore, 40km inland and 12 hours upstream from Ballina, reported a second death, with the body of a woman in her 80s discovered in a South Lismore home on Tuesday afternoon. Another woman in her 80s was found dead that morning. The deaths brings the toll from the flood disaster, which began last week in south-east Queensland, to 11. Thirty evacuation orders and four evacuation warnings remain in place across the northern rivers region. “Hundreds of thousands of people have been impacted by this event,” the NSW emergency services minister, Stephanie Cooke, told the ABC on Wednesday morning. “It is not over by any stretch of the imagination.” Cooke said the situation remained “very dangerous”. Water is bubbling out of gutters and stormwater drains in Ballina, which is at the mouth of the flooded Wilsons and Richmond river catchments. The high tide was expected to peak at 1.8m just after 9am. Authorities were hoping water from the two swollen catchments, which began to reach the town on Tuesday, would have drained away before the tide rose. That does not appear to have happened. The Richmond River peaked at 7.15m at Woodburn, four hours upstream from Ballina – almost 2m higher than its February 1954 peak of 5.42m. All that water is now rushing to Ballina, in what authorities have warned could be a one-in-500-year flood. Flood waters rose in the town at 9pm on Tuesday, in time with the high tide, reaching half a metre higher than they had earlier in the day. The hospital was evacuated at 10pm, with patients moved to a makeshift ward at Xavier Catholic College. A temporary emergency department was also set up. Many residents are stranded and power and phone line outages means communication to many has been cut off. The community Facebook page on Wednesday was awash with requests for people with boats to rescue those stranded. Upstream at Coraki, a small town at the meeting point of the Wilson and Richmond Rivers, there are reports of significant stock losses. One person reported missing 19 horses from one property.

Evacuation orders remain in place for Ballina Island, the Ballina town centre and South Ballina, as well as low-lying areas of Lennox Head. Cooke said it was too early to say how many homes had been lost. “We are actually training up additional assessors as we say, RFS volunteers and staff going to be trained up in that aspect because we want to get on to that recovery phase as quickly as we possibly can,” she said. “And they will move in as soon as it is safe to do so.” The government services minister, Linda Reynolds, said the federal government had received 145,000 claims for the one-off $1,000 disaster recovery payment. That’s 14 times the number of applications in the 2021 floods, when 10,245 claims were made. “We’ve already paid 35,000 people money which is over $35m, so we can make the payments very quickly,” Reynolds told ABC radio on Wednesday. “Given the unprecedented nature of this disaster we’ve already got teams out at evacuation centres in Brisbane and as it’s safe to do so, that’ll roll out to the 11 evacuation centres [in NSW] today.” Reynolds said many of those applying do not have all their identification documents but the priority was to get money out. It’s a system Services Australia had been able to perfect, she said, because Australia has been hit by so many disasters. “People can still apply and get get the money straight away, and we’ll worry about the paperwork later.”",News/Australia news,Ballina flood: wall of water racing to town amid warning NSW conditions remain ‘very dangerous’,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/02/ballina-flood-wall-of-water-racing-to-town-amid-warning-nsw-conditions-remain-very-dangerous
3/2/2022,"The teenager known for tracking Elon Musk’s jet has started to monitor the flight paths of Russian oligarchs as their movements come under increasing scrutiny following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a new Twitter account created over the weekend, 19-year-old Jack Sweeney from Florida has already amassed nearly 162,000 followers as the teen tracks the private jets of at least 21 Russian billionaires and tycoons. According to the new account @RuOligarchJets, the private jets and helicopters of Roman Abramovich, owner of Chelsea Football Club, have been taking off and touching down in various destinations including Moscow, Baku, Saint Kitts and Nevis and Dubai as of Monday. In addition to tracking flight movements, Sweeney also tracks other measures including fuel usage and cost. According to @RuOligarchJets, Abramovich’s Jet LX-RAY that landed in Baku had a flight time of 2 hours and 27 minutes, used 3,767kg of jet fuel which cost $6,369 and spent 13 tonnes of CO2 emissions. Other oligarchs being tracked by Sweeney include the steel magnate Alexander Abramov. According to Sweeney’s tracking, Abramov’s jets and helicopters have been taking off and touching down in locales spread across the world including London, Seychelles, Antigua and Barbuda and Abu Dhabi. Speaking to NBC, the 19-year-old University of Central Florida student said, “It’s just been crazy. I just figured some people would be interested in it. I just didn’t think all kinds of people would be.” Sweeney, who is studying information technology, added, “Before this, I didn’t even know there were these [influential] oligarchs like this. They probably do have a decent amount of power from what I can understand.” Howard Stoffer, an international affairs professor and Russia specialist at the University of New Haven, told NBC that these oligarchs “are the glitterati of Russia”. “They should be exposed and they should be paying whatever price a country can extract from them … Get these [airplane] tail numbers out. Tell the governments these are the people, this is where they’re located and let them take whatever action they feel is appropriate,” he added. Along with Russian billionaires, Sweeney also has started tracking the flight paths of planes and jets owned by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Last week, he launched @PutinJet but added a disclaimer, saying, “Don’t expect this to be too accurate though, there are a dozen VIP Russian planes and ADS-B [Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast] coverage isn’t great in Russia.” In addition to the Russian president and tycoons, Sweeney created at least 16 other automated Twitter accounts that track the flight movements of the rich and famous, including the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and the rapper Drake. “They’re either really prominent people or just like really interesting,” Sweeney said recently, referring to the people he tracks.",News/Technology,Teen who tracked Elon Musk’s jet turns his attention to Russian oligarchs,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/mar/01/teen-tracks-russian-oligarchs-elon-musk
3/2/2022,"America’s largest civil rights non-profit has filed a lawsuit asking a Texas state court to block officials from investigating parents who seek medically necessary gender-affirming care for their children. The lawsuit, filed on Tuesday by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), ACLU of Texas and Lambda Legal, named the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, as a defendant, along with the Texas department of family and protective services (DFPS) and its commissioner, Jaime Masters. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of a DFPS employee, her husband and her transgender child, who have chosen to remain anonymous. According to the lawsuit, an investigator from child protective services visited the family’s home to interview them on 25 February and also sought access to the child’s medical records, but their parents refused to sign the release forms. Last week, Abbott and Ken Paxton, the Texas attorney general, sparked outrage after Abbott ordered DFPS to investigate gender-affirming surgeries and medical care, which Paxton called “child abuse”. The lawsuit argues that Abbott and DFPS “trampled on the constitutional rights of transgender children, their parents, and professionals who provide vital care to transgender children”. “The defendants have, without constitutional or statutory authority, acted to create a new definition of ‘child abuse’ that singles out a subset of loving parents for scrutiny, investigation and potential family separation,” the lawsuit said, adding that their actions have caused “terror and anxiety” among transgender youth and their families and have singled them out “for discrimination and harassment”. Announcing the state’s move last week, Abbott said: “There is no doubt that these procedures are ‘abuse’ under Texas law, and thus must be halted. [DFPS] has a responsibility to act accordingly. I’ll do everything I can to protect against those who take advantage of and harm young Texans.” Abbott noted that Texas law imposes reporting requirements upon all licensed professionals who have direct contact with children, including teachers, nurses, doctors, daycare employees, employees of a clinic or healthcare facility that provides reproductive services, and juvenile probation officers. Under the Texas family code, failure to report abuse is a criminal offense. “No family should have to fear being torn apart because they are supporting their trans child,” said Adri Pérez, a policy and advocacy strategist at the ACLU of Texas. Paul Castillo, a Lambda Legal senior counsel echoed Pérez’s words, saying, “For Governor Abbott and Attorney General Paxton, it seems the cruelty is the point … “They are joining a politically motivated misinformation campaign with no consideration of medical science and seem determined to criminalize parents seeking to care and provide for their kids, and medical professionals abiding by accepted standards of care for transgender youth.” According to ACLU, a court could rule as soon as Tuesday.",News/US news,Lawsuit aims to stop Texas investigating parents seeking care for trans children,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/lawsuit-aims-to-block-texas-investigating-parents-seeking-care-trans-children
3/2/2022,"Much like Fleabag and Chewing Gum before it, Mood (BBC Three) is a TV transfer of a one-woman play. This six-part series started life as the well-received Superhoe at the Royal Court theatre in London, and though the name did not survive the transition, writer and star Nicôle Lecky reprises her role as Sasha here. Sasha is 25, lives at home with her mother and stepfather in east London, and in the tradition of all good dramas, she kicks off proceedings by blowing up her life. Almost literally, in fact. In the first episode, Sasha wakes up in her bedroom at home, next to a half-full kebab tray, and attempts to piece together the events of the previous night. Mood’s ability to cook up an atmosphere of anxiety is remarkable: when Sasha checks her phone to see 44 outgoing calls to a man named Anton, I felt my chest tighten. There is a voice note that she musters up the courage to listen to – with growing horror – and short flashes of scenes that may or may not be helpful revivals of her memories. The fact that her hands look distinctly fire-blackened suggests the night did not end well. If the small matter of arson wasn’t present, this might seem like a standard self-destructive sad-girl drama. But it has a clever way of sidestepping expectations, and feels fresher than its component parts initially suggest. Sasha is a singer and a rapper who is desperate to make it big, but has no idea where to put her talents. Frustration makes her angry and reckless, and her family show little support for her dreams. Her mother, Laura (a barely recognisable Jessica Hynes), pours scorn on her for trying to “record an EP that no one’s ever going to listen to”, while her stepfather, Kevin (Paul Kaye), decries social media culture and its obsession with image. “Social media has convinced you that you’re all going to be the next Lisa Stansfield,” he scoffs. “I don’t even know who that is, bruv!” Sasha snaps back. There are enormous cracks between the truth of any situation and what people put online, and this tension continues to fascinate storytellers. The recent Chloe, on BBC One, had a similar line in teasing out the reality behind the filters. But this is more surreal. Sasha’s pop-star ambitions are played out as imagined music videos. At the start of the opening episode, she twirls and moves through her estate, flanked by backing dancers and clouds of flare-pink smoke. Then the music grows tinny, she lifts her phone, and that world falls away. She is irritated that it disappears, which sets the tone nicely: she is not going to be an easy-to-root-for heroine, but someone far more complicated and nuanced. The music is a big part of the show, and Lecky performs original tracks that she wrote herself. It can take a bit of adjusting to the frequent appearance of songs that reference characters by name, as it’s not a musical as such. Occasionally, when a song breaks out, it lends this a more amateur feel, which jars with the rest of the story, which is so confident and assured. But when it works, it works. There’s a self-loathing rap as Sasha figures out what happened at her ex’s house, and in the second episode there is an exquisite scene at the jobcentre, when Sasha’s internal critic turns the whole thing into a foul-mouthed song and dance. Mood has an outrageous streak. Sasha’s relationship with her family is strained, and a showdown with Kevin that starts as a fairly straightforward row turns into a near-slapstick mess that is as funny as it is horrifying. Inevitably, Sasha has to find somewhere new to live, and it takes her off into an entirely different world. There is a boldness to how the show explores its themes. During a drug deal, Sasha meets the vivacious, chaotic Carly, a party girl who brings her into an even messier orbit. Under Carly’s influence and tutelage, Sasha starts to see the sex work of “camming” – performing in front of a webcam – as a potential solution to her money troubles. Carly wonders if it’s really any different from bikini pics on Instagram. We are sure to find out soon. Darkness is there from the beginning of Mood, and always threatening to intrude. Yet it creeps up on Sasha slowly, with almighty power. Sasha is a woman in pain, and this can be painful to watch. But this drama is invigorating, and refreshingly easy in its own skin.",Arts/Television & radio,"Mood review – songs, sorrow and sex work in Nicôle Lecky’s bold, fresh drama",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/mar/01/mood-review-songs-sorrow-and-sex-work-in-nicole-leckys-bold-fresh-drama
3/2/2022,"As the evening wore on Antonio Conte resembled an increasingly disappointed teacher, apparently saddened by his class’s failure to absorb the basic lessons he had so painstakingly drilled into them. The Tottenham manager did not look entirely surprised when his worst fears were realised and, deep in extra time, 19-year-old Josh Coburn stepped off Middlesbrough’s bench and scored a fine, richly deserved winner for Chris Wilder’s impressive side. Admittedly Spurs – and Harry Kane in particular – were far from their best, considerable credit must go to a meticulously organised Middlesbrough and, in particular, Jonny Howson, who shone in a defensive midfield role. Although Kane had a second half goal disallowed for offside, Championship Boro – who beat Manchester United on penalties at Old Trafford in the fourth round – finished the stronger side, suggesting they would not be out of their depth in the Premier League. Wilder jokes that Conte likes to copy his tactical blueprint, and, true to form, two managers who enjoy a decent rapport configured their teams in three at the back, wing-back propelled, formations. Wilder, though, had taken the precaution of deploying Howson in a deep lying midfield role and Howson initially enjoyed a degree of success in helping his defence thwart Kane and company. Conte’s craving for silverware dictated Kane was never going to be rested on a night when Tottenham’s manager made no alterations to the team which had started the 4-0 win at Leeds last Saturday. Wilder’s overriding priority is promotion but he regards the twin pursuit of a play-off place and the FA Cup as far from incompatible and duly started a strong side in front of more than 30,000 at the Riverside. Boro fans had their hearts in their mouths as Conte’s wing-backs, Matt Doherty and Ryan Sessegnon, combined in a fluent attacking move which concluded with Sessegnon creating a chance which Kane would surely have polished off but for Dael Fry’s last-ditch interception. That apart, the first half was not exactly replete with chances as a disciplined Boro side featuring some decent midfield moments on the part of Matt Crooks hogged plenty of possession but kept things fairly tight. Retaining their composure, Wilder’s players took no unnecessary attacking risks as Spurs, too, stayed patient and seemed content to play very much on the counterattack. They might have taken the lead on one such break but despite Lumley charging unwisely off his line and watching in horror as Doherty rounded him, the right wing-back ended up missing an open goal, shooting wide from an admittedly awkward angle. In the absence of much goalmouth action the subplot involving the quick, elusive Sessegnon and Boro’s right wing-back Isaiah Jones proved compelling. Going forward, Jones consistently looked the home player most capable of getting behind Conte’s backline and his sharp advances helped take the edge off the mood of slight impatience starting to permeate the cool Teesside air. It, albeit temporarily, evaporated as Duncan Watmore accelerated beyond three visiting defenders and played in Jones who promptly collapsed in close proximity to Sessegnon. The Riverside demanded a penalty but Darren England, the referee, was not fooled, swiftly dismissing Boro’s forlorn appeals. That incident seemed to bring out a certain indignation in Spurs and, shortly afterwards, Lumley did well to divert Eric Dier’s subtly curving free-kick behind. Kane thought he had volleyed his side ahead after connecting with a flick-on from the ensuing corner but, much to the Riverside’s collective delight, that effort was disallowed for an offside. By now it was clear that an unusually irritable-looking Kane was struggling to hit the imperious heights he reached at Leeds and it seemed thoroughly emblematic of his evening when he slipped while taking a dangerously placed free-kick before watching the ball roll harmlessly into the wall. Howson very nearly showed him how to do it, curling a dead ball of his own fractionally wide of Hugo Lloris’s goal. At this stage Conte was running through his full repertoire of sorrowful technical area expressions and, immediately after the unmarked Arsenal loanee Folarin Balogun, newly on for Watmore, shot off target when well placed, Tottenham’s manager made a double substitution. As Balogun doubtless regretted leaning back as he met Andraz Sporar’s fizzing pass, Emerson Royal and Steven Bergwijn replaced Doherty and Sessegnon. As extra time beckoned both sides switched formation to a back four but Boro finished the first 90 minutes stronger with Lloris saving from Jones and Crooks and Howson both also going close. Similar one-way traffic continued in extra time with Lloris denying Marcus Tavernier and Jones again while Howson miscued from a good position. Eventually Boro got their deserved break through. Coburn, an academy product from just down the road in Bedale, had just stepped off the bench when he met Crooks’ clever past and, holding off Cristian Romero, lashed a rising shot unerringly past Lloris and into the top corner from a tight angle.",Sport/Football,Middlesbrough’s Josh Coburn dumps Spurs out of FA Cup in extra time,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/01/middlesbrough-tottenham-hotspur-fa-cup-fifth-round-match-report
3/2/2022,"A long anticipated and widely criticized review of Wisconsin’s 2020 election has embraced fringe conspiracy theories and argued there were grounds for the legislature to “decertify” the results of the 2020 election, something legal experts have said is impossible. A report released on Tuesday was the result of months of work by Michael Gableman, a former state supreme court justice hired by the state assembly to review the election. Gableman’s efforts, backed by $676,000 in public funds, have been widely criticized as partisan, sloppy and unnecessary. Recounts in two of Wisconsin’s largest counties affirmed Joe Biden’s victory there in 2020 and an inquiry by the non-partisan legislative audit bureau also found no evidence of widespread fraud. Nonetheless, Gableman’s 136-page report offered a litany of accusations that culminated in an argument that the legislature should consider rescinding the election results. “I believe the legislature ought to take a very hard look at the option of decertification,” Gableman said in a presentation on Tuesday morning to the state assembly. Just before Gableman began speaking, Trump encouraged supporters to tune in to Gableman’s presentation. “It is clear that the Wisconsin legislature (acting without the concurrence of the governor), could decertify the certified electors in the 2020 presidential ​​election,” he wrote in his report. “This action would not, on its own, have any other legal consequence under state or federal law. It would not, for example, change who the current president is.” The document offers one of the clearest examples to date of how Republicans across the US are embracing efforts to overturn the results of validly executed elections – a new phenomenon experts call election subversion. In addition to legislation, Republicans who have embraced the idea of a stolen election are trying to take control of key election posts that would allow them to block validly cast votes from being certified in future elections. Gableman’s report, which cycled through numerous falsehoods that have already been debunked, appears to be a clear effort to offer the legislature justification for overturning the results of the 2020 race. Wisconsin Republicans have split on the idea of decertifying the election, which is a fringe legal theory. Jim Steineke, the majority leader in the GOP-controlled state assembly, tweeted on Tuesday that decertification was a “fool’s errand” and he would do everything he could during his time in office to block such an effort from moving forward. Gableman zeroed in on a number of election-related issues in Wisconsin that have already been scrutinized. He focused on grants given to election officials in the state from the Center for Tech and Civic Life to facilitate voting. The grants were funded by money from a donation from the Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, and his wife Priscilla Chan. Three courts and the state elections commission have rejected arguments that the grants, which were received in 39 of the state’s 72 counties, were unlawful. Gableman also attacked the state elections commission’s decision to suspend a special voting procedure in nursing homes amid the pandemic in 2020. State law requires local clerks to send special voting deputies to nursing homes to assist people with filling out their ballots. With the Covid-19 pandemic raging in 2020, the state elections commission voted on a bipartisan basis to suspend that requirement and send absentee ballots instead. A local sheriff in Racine county released an investigation last year in which family members claimed their relatives had cast votes but did not have the mental capacity to do so. During Tuesday’s hearing, Gableman played several videos of nursing home residents who were recorded as having cast ballots in 2020. Several of the people were incapacitated or appeared confused about voting. In Wisconsin, a mentally incapacitated person only loses the right to vote if a judge explicitly orders that. Gableman’s review did not make clear whether those voters were legally barred from voting by a judge. Ann Jacobs, a Democrat who chairs the state elections commission, criticized the report and factchecked it in real time. Wisconsin’s governor, Tony Evers, a Democrat, also criticized the review. “This circus has long surpassed being a mere embarrassment for our state. From the beginning, it has never been a serious or functioning effort, it has lacked public accountability and transparency, and it has been a colossal waste of taxpayer dollars,” he said in a statement. “Enough is enough. Republicans in the legislature have always had the ability to end this effort, and I call on them to do so today.” Gableman said he would continue his work, though it is unclear if the assembly will back him. While Gableman’s initial contract expired in December, he said he believed its authority extended into 2022 and that he was negotiating new terms with the legislature.",News/US news,Widely criticized Wisconsin report repeats falsehoods in argument to ‘decertify’ 2020 election,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/01/widely-criticized-wisconsin-report-repeats-falsehoods-argument-decertify-2020-election
3/2/2022,"You had to feel for Peterborough in a way. Make it through to the last 16 of the FA Cup for the first time in 36 years, bravely hold off one of the world’s best teams for an hour, and your reward? To get schooled by half a billion pounds’ worth of talent on your home turf. But if the skilled resistance of Grant McCann’s team finally crumbled in the last half-hour, in many ways the real reward was simply to be here: in the shop window, live on primetime ITV, bumping Emmerdale off the schedules. They will remember this evening at London Road for a long time; longer, at any rate, than Manchester City. It was a curiously scruffy evening for the champions, who naturally dominated possession but spent large periods struggling to create, gave up several good chances and only really lifted the siege later in the game. Before all of that, however, there were some formalities to be dispensed with. It was in many ways a pre-match rich in symbolism, as Fernandinho poignantly handed over the captain’s armband to his Ukrainian teammate Oleksandr Zinchenko. Peterborough, meanwhile, had prepared their own tribute, sending their club mascot – a human-sized rabbit named Peter Burrow – running around the pitch before kick‑off, bearing a Ukraine flag in one hand and swinging a giant carrot with the other. Of all the consequences of Vladimir Putin’s invasion, this was perhaps one that nobody saw coming. The City fans gathering outside the cathedral from late afternoon had wasted no time in camping out in Peterborough territory, and nor did their team as soon as the game started. In a way, City did what they do with virtually all their opponents: they played as if they didn’t exist. Indeed you occasionally suspect that for Pep Guardiola the perfect game would involve no opposition at all, just a series of dizzying passing triangles wending their way across a deserted field, and ending in an emphatic Raheem Sterling tap-in at the back post. Yet as Peterborough safely saw out the early stages and continued to hold out through the first half, as City passed and dribbled and crossed their way into a maze of their own making, it became clear that they were missing something. A creative spark. An outlet. Someone who can pick apart deep-set defences, beat a man and do the unexpected. What they were missing, above all, was Jack Grealish. The catch was that Grealish had started the game and was already on the pitch, starting his first game in almost a month. But somehow his quiet opening felt analogous to his nascent City career, a man trying for all the world to prove that he is more than a bauble, an ornamentation on an already brilliant team, a £100m trimming. Earlier this season he admitted he had not been producing the goals and assists his price tag might suggest, a claim quickly rejected by Guardiola this week. “Players today play for the statistics, but this is the biggest mistake,” Guardiola scoffed. “They say: ‘How many goals did I score, how many assists?’ This is the problem. These statistics never existed before.” Notwithstanding the fact that goals and assists have been around for quite a while, there was a certain amount of truth there. Grealish isn’t simply there to put away chances; he’s there to draw defenders towards him, reel them in, create space. The problem isn’t so much what Grealish does with the ball; it’s getting the ball to him in the first place. In the first phase, Guardiola wants his wingers to stay wide to stretch the defence. Now, obviously Grealish can do this. It’s just not his instinct. In his long career with Aston Villa and England, he has never really been in a position where his function is to sacrifice himself for other players. His natural orientation is towards the centre. And so sometimes the runs are a little mistimed, the positioning a couple of yards off. The beauty of this City system is that players know each other’s movements so intricately that they can play the pass almost without looking up. For whatever reason, Grealish isn’t quite on that wavelength yet. But obviously you stick with him. Because when he does get the ball, everything makes sense. Slowly he began to grow into the game, to sniff out the space, to tease and torment. It was his slipped pass to Phil Foden that created the deadlock-breaking goal for Riyad Mahrez, one of those passes played entirely on the off-beats, shuffled out of his feet like a card trick. Seven minutes later, he finally had his statistic, bringing down Foden’s long ball with educated laces and finishing with a delicious flourish. There were chances for more, but City’s work for the night was done. At full time the home fans rose in acclaim. Peter Burrow swung his big foam carrot around and around like a mace. Grealish strolled over to the away fans and accepted a warm ovation. It had been an evening of little victories, in more ways than one.",Sport/Football,Jack Grealish shows what he can do for Manchester City – if he gets the ball | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/mar/01/jack-grealish-manchester-city-peterborough-fa-cup-fifth-round
