1/5/2022,"Gal Gadot has sought to explain the thinking behind her widely ridiculed cover of the John Lennon song Imagine, posted to Instagram at the start of the pandemic. The video, which featured Gadot along with stars including Kristen Wiig, Natalie Portman, Will Ferrell, Zoë Kravitz, Natalie Portman and Jamie Dornan each singing a line from the song, was intended as a statement of solidarity.  This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. “We are in this together, we will get through it together,” Gadot captioned the original post from March 2020, but many criticised the project as tone deaf, highlighting the apparent disconnect between lyrics such as “imagine no possessions” warbled from multimillion dollar mansions while hundreds of thousands lost their lives, relatives, jobs and homes. Speaking to InStyle magazine, Gadot said that the timing of video – now viewed more than 10m times – was the central problem. “The pandemic was in Europe and Israel before it came [to the US] in the same way. “I was seeing where everything was headed. But [the video] was premature. It wasn’t the right timing, and it wasn’t the right thing. It was in poor taste. “All pure intentions, but sometimes you don’t hit the bullseye.” At the time of posting, Gadot had been in isolation for almost a week, she said, and watching the crisis unfold had left her feeling “philosophical”. Speaking to Vanity Fair last year, Gadot was unapologetic about the video, calling it “just not the right good deed. I had nothing but good intentions and it came from the best place, and I just wanted to send light and love to the world. “I can only say that I meant to do something good and pure, and it didn’t transcend.”",Arts/Film,Gal Gadot: Imagine video at start of pandemic was ‘in poor taste’,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2022/jan/05/gal-gadot-imagine-video
1/5/2022,"General Máximo Gómez, a key figure in Cuba’s 19th-century wars of independence against Spain once said: “Cubans either don’t meet the mark – or go way past it.” A century and a half later, the aphorism rings true. This downtrodden island struggles to keep the lights on, but has now vaccinated more of its citizens against Covid-19 than any of the world’s major nations.  More than 90% of the population has been vaccinated with at least one dose of Cuba’s homegrown vaccines, while 83% have been fully inoculated. Of countries with populations of over a million, only the United Arab Emirates has a stronger vaccination record. “Cuba is a victim of magical realism,” said John Kirk, professor emeritus of Latin American studies at Dalhousie University, Canada. “The idea that Cuba, with only 11 million people, and limited income, could be a biotech power, might be incomprehensible for someone working at Pfizer, but for Cuba it is possible.” Like most Latin American countries, Cuba knew it would struggle to buy vaccines on the international market. So in March 2020, with foreign exchange reserves plummeting due to the loss of tourism revenue and ferocious new US sanctions, the island’s scientists got to work. The gamble paid off: this spring Cuba became the smallest country in the world to successfully develop and produce its own Covid vaccines. Since then its well-staffed, if dilapidating universal health service, has rolled out injections at a fast clip, inoculating even young children (all vaccination on the island is voluntary). Both vaccines are over 90% effective, according to Cuban-run clinical trials conducted last spring. Successful rollout has brought infection rates down from among the highest in the western hemisphere last summer to low levels today. Last August the island reported hundreds of Covid deaths per week; last week there were three. The vaccine success is all the more striking when set against the parlous state of the healthcare service in other areas. With hard currency inflows cut in half over the last two years, antibiotics are now so scarce that 20 pills of amoxicillin trade on the black market for the equivalent of a month’s minimum state salary. Out of plaster cast, doctors in some provinces now resort to wrapping broken bones in used cardboard. “Ever since the 1959 revolution, Cubans have embarked on these grand crusades which are quixotic yet often successful,” said Gregory Biniowsky, a Havana-based lawyer. A prime example, Biniowsky said, was Fidel Castro’s pipe dream of investing one billion dollars in biotech after the Soviet Union disintegrated. “Any rational adviser would have said this was not the time to invest resources in something that might bear fruit in 25 years. And yet here we are now … where these fruits of the biotech investment are saving lives.” Other quests have dramatically failed: the Ten Million Ton Sugar Harvest of 1970 aimed to produce an unprecedented amount of sugar to spur growth. But to cut the cane, workers were pulled from their regular jobs, paralysing industry and wreaking havoc on the economy. Last year Cuba harvested seven times less sugar than in 1959. “As a nation there’s a tendency to get really good with the big things, and awful at the everyday things,” said Hal Klepak, professor emeritus of history and strategy at the Royal Military College of Canada. “The whole idea of electrifying the country [in under a decade], abolishing illiteracy in 2.5 years, and medical internationalism – these were all just mad schemes. And they did it.” Today, Cuba posts tens of thousands of doctors and nurses doing humanitarian work abroad – but fails to grow enough potatoes for the population. Cuba’s highly centralized, state planning system – one of the last in the world – goes some way to explaining this paradox. When there is political will from the top, objectives can be driven forward; when there’s a lack of direction, the island’s rigid, Kafkaesque bureaucracy can elevate passing the buck to an art form. “In capitalism you tend to have, even with very little things, somebody to fill the market,” said Klepak. “The difference with Cuba is that for [most economic] decision-making, there isn’t anyone but the state.” After registering less than 100 cases a day for weeks, infection rates are now rising due to the highly contagious Omicron variant. Cuban scientists have not released data on the efficacy of their vaccines against Omicron but have begun work to update their vaccine against the variant. In the meantime, the Cuban ministry of public health has fast-tracked its booster campaign, and aims to give almost the entire population an extra shot of vaccine this month.",News/World news,Cuba’s vaccine success story sails past mark set by rich world’s Covid efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/cuba-coronavirus-covid-vaccines-success-story
1/5/2022,"As we chat, Mike van Erp keeps glancing at the line of vehicles queueing on the road in Hyde Park, London. Suddenly, he spots something. “Here we go,” he says, swinging around his sensible-looking blue touring bike, and pedalling away from the traffic lights. He edges along the stationary vehicles until he is parallel to a car. It is well over a minute before the driver looks up and spots him – and the camera strapped to his baseball cap. When he returns, a grinning Van Erp tells me the man reacted badly to the realisation he was being caught on camera. Why the fury? The driver was using his phone as he waited for the traffic to move – and Van Erp recorded him doing it. In the coming months the man will most likely face a fine and six points on his driving licence, in turn triggering a significant jump in his insurance premium.  Van Erp, a 49-year-old professional carer, says he has now reported close to 1,000 law-breaking drivers to the police, with about 80% facing prosecution. After any court proceedings are finished, he posts the footage on his YouTube channel. There have been some famous faces among the drivers he has reported. In early December, Van Erp allegedly filmed Frank Lampard using a phone while driving – the former footballer has denied the offence. Footage shot by Van Erp, however, has resulted in court action against ex-boxer Chris Eubank and Guy Ritchie, with the film director banned from driving. All of this has led to headlines, occasional TV appearances and made him the semi-reluctant public face of a new era of road crime enforcement, one in which police forces are being encouraged to accept online complaints about offences, backed up by video footage. Many of the complaints come from cyclists, who view such footage as one of the few ways they can push back against endemic levels of dangerous driving. It can be a controversial area. Van Erp regularly features in news articles as a “vigilante cyclist”, a description he dislikes intensely and which he has, on occasion, managed to have altered after complaining. Van Erp’s 65,000 subscribers to his CyclingMikey YouTube channel have been enough to earn him a modest extra income as a result of his actions. Yet, he says, far from selecting prominent targets, he did not recognise any of the celebrities when he approached them. (The footage of him challenging Eubank for holding a phone at the wheel of his convertible Rolls-Royce sees him ask the clearly unimpressed former world champion, “Are you famous?”). And, he insists, a media profile was never his aim. His motivation is much simpler: trying to make the roads safer, one driver at a time. A Dutch national, who grew up in Zimbabwe and moved to the UK in 1998 to work in IT, he has a particularly personal stake in this. When he was still living in Zimbabwe, his father was killed by a drunk driver while riding his motorbike. Van Erp, then 19, was called by a local shopkeeper about the accident, and went straight to a suburb of Harare, where they lived, to find the mangled wreck of the motorbike and his father’s body covered by a blanket. “It was his birthday on the day, and in the morning I’d begged him to come gliding with me,” Van Erp recalls. “I had a pretty awesome upbringing and was close to my dad. He taught me to ride a bike, to fix punctures, to ride a motorcycle, and to drive a car.” It’s this memory, he says, that “really gives me that extra ounce of determination to cope with the hassle of admin of reporting drivers – I don’t like admin very much.” There is, he adds, a wider motivation: “I just like to think that with the power of one I’m trying to change a little bit of road safety. Most people who cycle realise that bad driving is largely tolerated by society. It’s not considered a really serious thing. Yet it’s claiming 1,800 people’s lives a year in the UK alone, and 27,000 are seriously injured. That’s a quite serious toll, isn’t it?” It is not only a serious toll, but one that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable road users. While the UK has better overall road casualty statistics than most nations, the risk of injury or death per mile is 25 times greater for cyclists than for than those travelling in cars. The UK is also one of the few European countries where fatalities among pedestrians have risen in recent years. The sort of law-breaking captured by Van Erp and his fellow camera cyclists undoubtedly plays a part. On 20mph-maximum roads, an average of 86% of drivers break the speed limit. And to understand the sheer extent of motorists using handheld phones while at the wheel, you only need to watch Van Erp at work. He began taking his on-the-road shots in 2006, using an early bike-mounted camera. “I started filming because I felt a little powerless,” he recalls. “I couldn’t do anything if a bad driver gave me a close pass, or risked my life in some way. On the various cycling forums we started talking about cameras, how they were miniaturising and getting better – even though they’re terrible compared with now.” Initially, police forces had very little interest in following up his footage even of the most dangerous incidents. Yet, very gradually this has changed – Van Erp’s first successful prosecution followed an incident in 2018 when a taxi driver overtook him very closely. Today, many forces allow footage and complaint details to be uploaded via the web, making it easier – and possibly more likely – that cyclists and other road users with dashcams will bother reporting bad driving. The National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) recently recommended that all forces in England and Wales set up such systems, a move instigated by DCS Andy Cox, the NPCC’s lead on traffic casualties and a pioneer in efforts to tackle them. But the ease of reporting road offences online for citizen volunteers such as Van Erp – who provide many more eyes on the road than would be possible for even the best-resourced police force – remains notably patchy. Camera users in Scotland, for instance, are still obliged to put their footage on to a DVD. Many people also complain that by submitting video they are treated only as witnesses, not potential victims, and so are not kept up to date about action taken. Statistics are limited on this new era of road crime enforcement. The Metropolitan police, the UK’s biggest police force, for example, says it does not keep any relevant figures. But freedom of information requests have revealed that several smaller forces now get hundreds of video complaints a year each, and as many as half lead to action. Van Erp says he has been told “sometimes half of driver awareness courses are filled with people caught by camera cyclists”. He became more diligent in his recording of road offences when he began seeing the results. “I started realising that real prosecutions were happening. And I thought, do you know what, it’s worth doing more than what just affects me, because that will help other people. You hope it will improve other people’s safety.” An hour with Van Erp in Hyde Park brings too many phone users for him to report. Yet, he says, while he is organised about backing up video files and cataloguing complaints and number plates, not least to identify what he calls “repeat customers” (his record is three – the driver of a red Porsche), he does not go out looking for phone-using drivers. He encounters enough of them during his usual cycle journeys – and official statistics illuminate how this happens. In the past four years, according to DVLA statistics, more than 90,000 British drivers have been caught driving while distracted, with 932 convicted at least twice, and one motorist punished nine times. Van Erp says he has to be mindful of how common phone use at the wheel is: “I don’t want this to consume my life. I have hobbies, and I have family. I limit how much time I spend on this.” Riding with him, however, also highlights how distracted drivers become once they pick up their phones. Several remain completely oblivious to the fact a lanky Dutchman has spent several minutes staring at them through the driver’s window, a camera attached to his white baseball cap – and that David, the Guardian photographer, is training a longer lens on them from across the street. Such up-close footage is needed because using a handheld phone is only deemed illegal if there is proof of interactive communication, such as sending messages, talking, or commenting on social media – although this law is due to be updated this year. “It means I have to get right up close and personal,” says Van Erp, who now uses a high-spec GoPro. What of those who argue that using a phone in stationary traffic does no harm? Van Erp has little patience with this – noting the “WhatsApp gap” – the way phone-distracted drivers tend to jerk forwards belatedly when the queue moves, often after a toot from behind. “There is evidence that phone use is as dangerous as drink-driving. I think it’s also very naive to imagine these people only use their phone in [stationary] traffic,” he says. Yet aside from his phone-use videos, his YouTube channel also documents an arguably more confrontational strand of his activism. A few years ago, Van Erp heard how queueing drivers at another London junction, in Regent’s Park, were impatiently darting down the wrong side of a traffic island to reach a right-hand turn – sometimes nearly hitting cyclists who were going the right way. He began lurking at the junction, and if a car tried the manoeuvre he would step out in front of it, blocking its path, and ordering the driver to go back. The results make compulsive viewing. In one particularly astonishing episode, currently on 1.7m views and rising, a pair of doctors in a hulking Volvo SUV are aghast at being challenged and insist that their profession means the driver should be allowed to flout road laws. But the most-watched clip, at almost 4m views, sees a driver become so incensed he bumps Van Erp several times with his Mercedes. When the police arrive the driver starts to argue with them too. Van Erp’s resolve – what he calls “a good example of Dutch stubbornness” – however, seems as unshakeable as his good humour. “You know what keeps me the most even-tempered? It’s the camera,” he says. “I know that the consequence will come anyway, and I know that I’m filming myself, and it’ll look worse if I behave badly. And also, the kinder and calmer I am, the worse it looks for the driver.” He regularly receives threats on social media, where he faces a near-continual barrage of anonymous insults. But again, his actions are rooted in painful personal experience of the consequences of such driving: when Van Erp was at school, he witnessed a friend being struck by a taxi driving the wrong way round a traffic island. His friend survived, but was badly injured. It’s not all criticism, however. Van Erp also has fans. “Mikey is an inspiration, genuinely,” says Jeremy Vine, the radio and TV presenter, who also chronicles the bad driving he sees on his bike commute via snappily edited videos using a 360-degree helmet camera. “I often bump into him around London,” Vine says. “He is not mad, not obsessed, not a vigilante, not on a crusade. He simply believes rules are there to be followed, because it was a drunk driver breaking the rules that took the life of his father. The police can’t police everything, so people like Mikey fill in the gaps.” Van Erp uses his social media reach to spread the message that there are increasing numbers of camera-equipped cyclists, meaning that poor driving has consequences. “I don’t really want the fame,” he says. “On the other hand I haven’t really got any choice about it. The result is I have to use it to spread the word about camera cyclists. “Most people are really quite careful towards others. But cars do blunt that a little bit. There’s something about being in a car that takes the kind edge off us. We’re insulated in a soundproof comfort zone, and we very much see it as our personal space.” With that, our chat ends and, camera still clamped to baseball cap, Van Erp cycles through the park towards home – not searching out dangerous drivers, but only too aware how easily one can arrive in your life, unheralded, and with devastating consequences.",Lifestyle/Life and style,‘I felt powerless – so I started filming’: CyclingMikey on his one-man battle with dangerous drivers,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/jan/05/filming-cyclingmikey-dangerous-drivers-mike-van-erp-motorists-britain-roads-safer
1/5/2022,"At three-and-a-bit hours long, this is worth every geeky minute if you’re into the genre of the title – think Witchfinder General all the way through to Midsommar. With its really smart deep dives into cultural criticism, this is a seasonal stocking overflowing with spooky fun. Writer-director Kier-La Janisse, founder of the Miskatonic Institute of Horror Studies, clearly knows the subject inside out, and finds the best authors, scholars and authorities to talk about the subject. But what’s really admirable is the way it is organised into digestible chapters that flow silkily from one subject to another, eased along by a spontaneous and colloquial voiceover from the director herself. As a film essay, the methodology is exemplary; if you want an education in an aspect of film over the winter and have finished watching all of Mark Cousins’ Story of Film docs, this offers an excellent next component. Arguably there may be a little overload, as Janisse and co get so engrossed in tracing the roots and shoots of the term “folk horror” across film, TV, literature and even theatre, that by the end it’s hard to remember what the genre’s defining characteristics are supposed to be. But ultimately you’ll know it when you see it: in film terms, it has to do with stories in rural settings where ancient skills, beliefs or practices rub up against a newer form of civilisation. Think of the pagan islanders with their maypoles and sacrifices in conflict with the austere Christian policeman in The Wicker Man, or the witchcraft practices involving animal transformations and blood meeting the prim 17th-century pilgrims in The Witch, directed by Robert Eggers (interviewed here).  These are just two of the obvious touchstones. Janisse includes clips from hundreds of much less well-known movies, many from the UK, which might be considered the spiritual homeland of folk horror, but spreading out to include gems from Australia, Indonesia, Mexico and Iceland. The discussion of the trope of Indigenous burial grounds in American folk horror is especially fascinating, for example, particularly to see how contemporary Americans struggle to cope with their colonial past (see Pet Sematary) as well as attitudes towards death and grieving (Midsommar).

1/5/2022,"The UK government is understood to be preparing to announce that people in England will no longer have to take PCR tests to confirm their coronavirus infection after a positive lateral flow test. The care minister, Gillian Keegan, told the Today programme that she understood the plan was “being considered but there isn’t a decision that’s been communicated to me yet”, adding that any change would be to reflect the “accuracy and the amount of lateral flow tests” rather than to curb staff shortages. She told BBC Breakfast that she did not know when any announcement would be scheduled.  She said there were “no immediate plans” to reduce the seven-day minimum isolation period down to five if a negative lateral flow is obtained, but added that it was “a reasonable question to ask” and one that is currently being considered by scientists. About 1 million people are thought to be isolating due to Covid, causing widespread absences and disruption across essential services, including healthcare, police and food processing. Keegan told Sky News that although the government does not collect figures on self-isolation, it estimates these based on the number of people who have tested positive in recent days, including Tuesday’s record of 218,724. Hospitals are reporting that they are struggling to cope with staff absences, with several declaring critical incidents and 17 in Greater Manchester saying they would suspend some non-urgent surgery as 15% of staff were off sick. An internal memo from the North East ambulance service foundation trust suggested that call handlers recommend people suffering from a heart attack or stroke get a lift into hospital from friends or family.Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, told the Today programme that healthcare absences were averaging at about 10%, with Covid the biggest reason, but that this figure was much higher in some hospital trusts. He approved of the proposals to remove the confirmatory PCR “as long as it’s based on the science” and not on “politics and blind hope”, and welcomed any measures that could ease pressure on hospitals, which are asking staff on leave or rest days, or who are recently retired, to come back. Asked about whether another possible solution could include bringing the isolation period down to five days, he reiterated this would only be an option “if the science indicates it’s safe”. He added: “The situation in relation to staff absences is so acute that we need to consider all possibilities.” Keegan said the government had known that this would be one of “the most pressurised winters” due to the NHS backlog that has built up over the pandemic, combined with flu and the arrival of the Omicron variant. “That’s why we’ve put an extra £5.4bn of investment to try and get extra staff, get some extra capacity to be able to put virtual wards in place, extra beds and extra capacity with the Nightingales,” she said. Keegan said she had asked NHS England to look into reports that friends or family are being asked to transport potential heart attack or stroke sufferers to hospital, which she said was not “an acceptable approach”. She told Sky News: “That is not what we have put in place at all. We have more ambulance crews in operation than we have ever had, we also gave £55m extra just for this period to cover staff and make sure we had increases in staff and staffing levels.”",News/World news,UK minister hints at end to follow-up PCRs after positive lateral flow test,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/covid-uk-follow-up-pcr-positive-lateral-flow-test
1/5/2022,"Judith Iturbe grimaces as she thinks about August and what it means for the residents and rhythms of Milmarcos. At the height of summer, the population of this small and beautiful Spanish village, which sits close to Castilla-La Mancha’s border with Aragón, rises from just 44 to about 1,000.  “For me, August is the worst time of the year because all these people come from the city with their urgent requirements,” says Iturbe, who runs a tiny brewery in Milmarcos. Twenty-one years ago, she and her partner decided to leave their hectic jobs and lives in Madrid and start over. If it was quiet they craved, they have not been disappointed. The only people on the streets of the village this afternoon are two older residents who sit on garden chairs by the church tower to chat and soak up the rays of the low winter sun. The peace and quiet, however, comes at a price. The doctor comes through just once a week, the village’s three children have an hour-long bus ride to school, and Milmarcos has precisely one shop and one bar. As Iturbe points out, only half-jokingly, this corner of Guadalajara province is one of the most hollowed-out parts of the demographic realm known as La España vaciada – the hollowed-out Spain. Decades of depopulation have left huge stretches of rural Spain starved of people, attention and investment, and prompted the country’s Socialist-led coalition government to establish a ministry for the demographic challenge. But for many in such areas, change has not come fast enough. At the end of September, an association of more than 160 local and regional groups decided to run as a joint platform in regional and national elections. The España Vaciada platform took its inspiration from the fact that Teruel Existe, a movement that campaigns to improve conditions in the overlooked Teruel region of eastern Spain, managed to win one seat in congress and two in the senate in the November 2019 general election. Despite having just one MP, Teruel Existe has become a powerful force in a political landscape that is increasingly fragmented and dependent on horse-trading to get things done. Antonio Saz, a co-ordinator for the España Vaciada association, says that while the electoral platform may be new, the “struggle against depopulation and for territorial rebalancing” dates back at least 20 years. “We always say we’re not some kind of planned action; we’re the consequences of ignoring and abandoning the rural world and depopulated areas,” he says. “These problems are now on politicians’ agendas, even if we’re not yet seeing them in their programmes and actions.” Among the platform’s 101 initiatives is a national plan with guaranteed funding that would enable overlooked parts of the country to catch up with more developed ones, the creation of a non-political, expert agency to tackle depopulation, and improved rail links and services. “We also have a simple plan to drive recovery and balance things up that we call 100/30/30,” says Saz. “Thats 100mbps of symmetrical internet, 30 minutes to basic services such as education, health or security, and 30km [18 miles] to a high-capacity road. If we could get all that, we’d have a far more well-balanced country.” The platform – which will face its first ballot-box test when it runs in February’s regional election in Castilla y León – is not fond of ideological labels. So would it be happy to strike deals with either the far-left Unidas Podemos or the far-right Vox? “Our ideology is driven by the vital necessity to tackle depopulation before it’s too late and we disappear – that’s what binds us more than left and right blocs,” says Saz. While he says it is far too early to speculate on electoral performances, Saz acknowledges the platform is keen to acquire the kind of clout Teruel Existe can exercise: “The more weight we have when it comes to seats, the more they’ll listen to us and the more we can do.” José Pablo Ferrándiz, a social sciences lecturer at Madrid’s Carlos III University, says the platform is likely to pose the biggest threat to Spain’s old political duopoly – the ruling Spanish Socialist Workers’ party (PSOE) and the conservative People’s party (PP). “In the face of these new demands – which actually aren’t new at all – the two big parties can’t say they’re the ones who are going to solve these problems because they’ve been voted in before and haven’t solved them,” he says. Ferrándiz thinks the arrival of España Vaciada – which follows the eruption in recent years of Podemos, Vox and the fading, centre-right Citizens party – could herald even greater fragmentation. “In a national political scenario where even the vote of Teruel Existe is fundamental in forming majorities – and potentially even in forming governments – the PP and the PSOE know that if these platforms grow and win even three or four seats, they will be important when it comes to forming national governments.” Back at the brewery, Iturbe is labelling beer bottles, keeping an eye on the electoral developments – and refusing to get her hopes up. “At least the platform is made up of people who know the rural world, so perhaps it’ll do something,” she says. “But on a national level, nothing’s changed politically and even after Podemos and Citizens, it’s all back in the hands of the PP and the PSOE.” Time, however, is running out for Milmarcos and for tens of thousands of other Spanish villages. As Iturbe notes, only a third of Milmarcos’s permanent residents are around 50 or younger. In 10 years’ time, many of its older people will be dead and its children will probably be thinking about moving elsewhere. “The politicians need to listen to us, because they haven’t so far,” she says. “They need to differentiate between the urban and the rural but at the moment, all the laws are drawn up in offices in the city, which means there’s no way they suit our needs. No matter how many times they come out here in their chauffeured cars, they never get it.”",News/World news,Empty promise: new political group speaks up for depopulated rural Spain,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/05/empty-promise-new-political-group-speaks-up-depopulated-rural-spain-espana-vaciada

The 18-year-old has joined from Pogon Szczecin for £8m on a contract to June 2026 but will go straight on loan to the Belgian club Royale Union St-Gilloise. Kozlowski made history when, aged 17 years and 246 days, he came on for Poland against Spain at Euro 2020, breaking a record set less than a week earlier by England’s Jude Bellingham.  “His style of play suits us and our style,” said Brighton’s manager, Graham Potter. “During my time here, we have done very well in recruiting players for the future and Kacper is a similar signing. “He will initially head out on loan, as it is important for him to continue his development, and he is keen to continue playing regularly.
