3/15/2022,"It was one of the most memorable moments of the Tokyo Games and Cedric Dubler’s act of sportsmanship on the athletics track has now been officially recognised with an Australian Olympic Committee award. Dubler sacrificed his own race in the closing stages of the 1,500m, the final event of the decathlon, to scream encouragement at Australian teammate Ash Moloney, who needed to cross the finish line close enough to a rival to secure a historic medal. With Dubler urging him on, Moloney pushed through the pain barrier to secure bronze and become the first Australian decathlete to win an Olympic medal. He said afterwards: “I could hear his [Dubler’s] voice bouncing in my cranium like a bat out of hell.” It was acknowledged on Tuesday with the AOC’s inaugural Cecil Healy Award for Outstanding Sportsmanship displayed at an Olympic Games. “In the closing stages, Cedric had no other thought, other than the possibility for his teammate winning an Olympic medal,” AOC chief executive Matt Carroll said. “He could have easily chosen to improve his own standing in the event, but he made another choice and it was a noble one.” The award was created in August 2018 in memory of Cecil Healy, whose act of sportsmanship at the 1912 Games in Stockholm was widely commended. The Australian swimmer insisted 100m favourite Duke Kahanamoku be allowed to contest the final, despite the American missing his semi-final due to an apparent mix-up. Healy’s stance led to officials holding a special semi-final to include Kahanamoku, who duly went on to win gold in the final. Healy won silver. “I am absolutely honoured and really quite amazed that something that happened in the moment can result in this type of recognition,” Dubler said. “We don’t compete at the Olympic Games thinking about these moments. Every athlete just wants to do their best and performance is the focus. “The camaraderie amongst decathletes is something very special, but I also felt a really strong bond within our Australian team in Tokyo. “I am still stunned that my spontaneous decision to urge him on struck such a chord around the world. I definitely can’t compare my actions with those of Cecil Healy, but I am immensely proud to be the first Australian to win this award, named in his honour.” Dubler will be formally honoured with the presentation of a special medal at the AOC’s AGM next month.",Sport/Sport,‘A noble choice’: Cedric Dubler’s Olympic act recognised with sportsmanship award,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/15/a-noble-choice-cedric-dublers-olympic-act-recognised-with-sportsmanship-award
3/15/2022,"Criminal barristers in England and Wales have voted overwhelmingly to take industrial action beginning next month in protest over levels of legal aid funding. A ballot by the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) saw 94% of votes in favour of refusing to accept returns – where a barrister steps in to represent a defendant whose original barrister is unable to attend court – from 11 April. The move is likely to add to the already substantial backlog in the crown courts, which stood at 58,350 cases in figures published last month. The CBA described the usual acceptance of returns as “a gesture of goodwill to prop up the criminal justice system”. After the results of the ballot – based on votes by 1,908 members, out of 2,400 criminal barristers – were published on Sunday night, the CBA’s chair, Jo Sidhu QC, and the vice-chair, Kirsty Brimelow QC, said the current government timetable brought no prospect of a new legal aid settlement until the end of September. They said: “Through our labour and our goodwill, we have sustained a chronically underfunded criminal justice system on behalf of the public while suffering substantial reductions in our real incomes and exhausted by the hugely increased demands placed upon us, often for little or no reward. “We have already lost too many of our colleagues who can no longer afford to maintain their commitment to criminal work and who have left our ranks out of desperation and despair. Every day we are losing more … The future viability and diversity of the criminal bar is already imperilled.” The Independent Review of Criminal Legal Aid, which was published in December, recommended a minimum increase of 15%, amounting to £35m, for advocates, which also includes solicitors advocating in the crown courts. The Ministry of Justice announced on Tuesday that it was accepting the recommendations of the review and that it would result in up to £135m extra spent on legal aid every year. The MoJ said criminal legal aid lawyers would receive their biggest pay boost in a decade and 3.5 million more people would have access to criminal legal aid at magistrates’ courts. The CBA has argued that the increase for barristers recommended by the review is too low. The CBA has expressed concerns that the minimum increase recommended by the review is insufficient and that barristers may not see any real increase in their legal aid fee income until 2024. In a message to members, Sidhu and Brimelow said: “We will continue to engage with the Ministry of Justice to seek a fair and reasonable settlement that reflects the demands of our members. With your resounding mandate we will pursue those discussions with determination and resolve.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: “We are disappointed in a vote for this course of action just days before we announce our plans to create a stable and sustainable legal aid sector for the future. “We encourage CBA members to read our proposals in full and respond to the consultation, rather than being drawn into action that will harm victims of crime.”",News/Law,Criminal barristers vote for industrial action over legal aid funding,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/mar/14/criminal-barristers-england-wales-industrial-action-legal-aid-funding
3/15/2022,"Half of low-paid workers in the UK are given less than a week’s notice of their shifts, according to a study highlighting an “insecurity premium” for employees paid close to the minimum wage. The Living Wage Foundation said 50% of people earning less than £9.90 an hour around the UK or £11.05 in London were told details of their work schedules with less than seven days before they were due to begin. In research highlighting the pressure on low-paid staff, the study from a poll of 2,000 adults found cleaners, couriers and some NHS staff were more likely to be affected by insecurity. In contrast, about 32% of all UK workers in full or part-time jobs are given less than a week’s notice of their shifts. The campaign group said lower-paid workers were therefore more likely to pay a financial price – an “insecurity premium” – because of the added costs of childcare and travel when shifts were cancelled or changed at short notice. Almost half of shift workers lose out on £30 or more a month because of last-minute changes, according to the study, leading almost a third to increase their reliance on credit cards and borrowing to make ends meet. “We’ve long known that it costs to be poor, but this research shows it’s even more costly to be both poor and in insecure work,” said Katherine Chapman, the director of the Living Wage Foundation. “In an unfolding cost-of-living crisis with energy bills set to rise even further, low-income households are facing ‘heat or eat’ decisions.” A separate study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank showed a growing proportion of Britain’s lowest earners are missing out on stronger earnings growth for employees on the minimum wage in recent decades. It found pay growth for the lowest-paid tenth of workers in the country had been twice as fast as for a worker on average pay between 2011 an 2019, helped by inflation-beating increases in the “national living wage”. However, it warned a quarter of the lowest fifth of earners are self-employed and not covered by the legal pay floor. The IFS said that while the government’s minimum wage had been a useful tool for increasing pay levels, workers on average pay had suffered from sluggish growth in earnings in recent years. It said median earnings for those born in the 1980s were no higher than they were for those born in the 1960 by the same point in their careers, spelling the end of steady growth in median living standards through the 20th century. Mark Franks, the director of welfare at the Nuffield Foundation, which funded the research, said: “Policies such as the minimum wage and tax credits have helped many low earners, but they have not been sufficient to fully protect all low-paid workers, including those among the growing number of self-employed. “This, in combination with sluggish pay growth and factors such as rising prices and a lack of access to stable housing, has left many individuals and families in vulnerable circumstances.”",News/Business,Half of UK low-paid workers given less than a week’s notice of shifts,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/mar/15/uk-low-paid-workers-shifts-living-wage-foundation
3/15/2022,"Seven in 10 snacks sold as part of lunchtime meal deals in UK high street shops and supermarkets contain dangerously large amounts of salt, sugar or saturated fat, a new analysis shows. The worst offenders include biscuits, cakes and crisps, according to research by the campaign group Action on Salt, which urged ministers to take action. Three in 10 products studied were found to contain high levels of salt, which can contribute to high blood pressure, which is the single biggest cause of heart attacks and strokes. For example, a packet of lemon and coriander green olives sold in the Co-op contained 2.02g of salt. That is the same as in five portions of salted peanuts and represents a third of an adult’s daily maximum salt intake of six grams recommended by health authorities in England. Action on Salt nutritionists analysed the content of 360 individual products which are found in meal deals, which typically consist of a sandwich or salad, snack and cold drink. “Without doubt meal deals are hugely popular, especially amongst the nation’s workforce looking for a convenient and ‘value for money’ lunch”, said Sheena Bhageerutty, an assistant nutritionist at the campaign group. “Yet unbeknown to many consumers, these meal combos and snacks are often exceedingly high in salt, which means an adult can consume their maximum daily recommended salt intake in just one meal without even knowing it.” In January the researchers looked at products sold in Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Boots, the Co-op, Morrison’s, Asda, Subway and Shell garages. All eight offer a meal deal combination that includes more salt than a McDonald’s Big Mac and fries. Cornish pasties, sausage rolls, chicken bites and mini-Cheddars emerged as those that were most heavily laden with salt. Researchers found that 82% of meal deal snacks at Subway were high in saturated fat, salt or sugar. Morrisons scored the best, but 63% of its equivalent products were also in that category. However, Morrisons emerged as the retailer with the highest proportion of snacks – 46% – which did not comply with government salt reduction targets across a range of foods. Sainsbury’s was the best on 19%. Graham McGregor, a professor of cardiovascular health at Queen Mary University of London, who is chairman of Action on Salt, said stripping out salt from meal deal products would save lives. “Given the fact that food companies have the very simple option to reformulate with less salt and help prevent the many thousands of people who currently die unnecessarily, it’s remarkable that very few companies choose this option”, he said.Ministers and Public Health England have been asking food manufacturers for years to cut the amount of salt they add to their products by 2024. However, progress reports in 2018 and 2020 found that while some targets had been met, many had not. Kate Halliwell, the chief scientific officer at the Food and Drink Federation, said: “For over a decade, food and drink manufacturers have worked hard to reduce the level of salt found in everyday foods, while still providing great tasting products that consumers enjoy.” FDF members have cut salt the amount of salt in their products by 16% since 2017, she insisted. “Our companies will continue their work to invest in new technology and methods to further reduce these levels without compromising on product safety, quality or taste”, she added. The Department of Health and Social Care have been contacted for their response.

3/15/2022,"Pep Guardiola said he had “no regrets” over Manchester City’s performance at Crystal Palace despite seeing his side drop two points that could prove critical to the title race. City were characteristically dominant with the ball at Selhurst Park but could not break down their energetic and well-organised opponents, meaning Liverpool can move a point behind them if they overcome Arsenal on Wednesday night. Bernardo Silva and Aymeric Laporte missed their best chances to score, the latter after João Cancelo had struck an upright from range, but Guardiola could find no fault with his players afterwards. “We played a really, really good game,” the City manager said. “Really good at a difficult stadium against a difficult side who defend deep. The way we played, I have no regrets. I would have preferred to win, but we played well.” Asked whether the title race had now been blown wide open, Guardiola repeated his frequent refrain that, even when City were 14 points clear during spells in February, he had never considered it to be over. “I don’t know, now we have four points [lead] and one game more, we play to win it,” he said. “We played a fantastic game in all departments, really focused. With 14 points [Liverpool] had played two games less. I said many times that we have many, many games still to play and the way we played in general is more than good.” Guardiola’s decision not to use any substitutes raised eyebrows, particularly given City struggled for openings in the latter stages. “I was thinking about that but the guys were playing good, the game was in a high rhythm,” he explained. Patrick Vieira was delighted with his players, who have now taken four points from their meetings with City this season. “It’s a really good statistic,” he said. “Our team performance was excellent: when you play against these kinds of teams and players you need to be a little bit lucky at times and we forced that luck to be on our side.” Palace’s players looked exhausted at full time. “We had to run because of the technical quality of City,” Vieira said. “The majority of our players are tired but it’s a really good feeling.”",Sport/Football,‘No regrets’ for Guardiola as Manchester City drop points at Crystal Palace,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/mar/14/no-regrets-for-guardiola-despite-city-letting-liverpool-back-into-title-race
3/15/2022,"At least one school in New South Wales has had to return to some days of remote learning amid surging Covid cases in students and staff. The school is one of many struggling to deal with spiralling cases among young people, with educators admitting learning is suffering. But the New South Wales education department says it is not planning to reintroduce masks in schools ahead of the general community. Queanbeyan High School principal Jennifer Green wrote to parents advising them of the changes after efforts to source casual teachers and combine classes failed to address the severe shortages. “Recent impacts from Covid-19 have meant that a number of teaching staff and / or students at Queanbeyan High School cannot come to school as they have tested positive for Covid-19,” she wrote on Monday. “Due to the number of teachers on leave in addition to the permanent positions we have been unable to fill, we are moving to mixed mode delivery options.” Year 11 and 12 students have been spared but other year levels will drop to three days a week in person learning and two days at home, with Green explaining the “best place for our students to learn is in the classroom” but that safety needed to be prioritised. NSW Association of Catholic Principals president, Michael Egan, said running schools like “normal” had become impossible as case numbers surged. “It’s not running normally, if you take it normally to be that a class has a competently trained teacher in that area in front of them. That’s just not happening,” he said. “We’re providing large amounts of supervision rather than actual teaching. Subjects with a practical component, they just aren’t happening. You can’t have the casual teacher come in and do a science experiment with kids.” Covid cases in under 20s have risen sharply – accounting for almost 29,000 of the 66,000 of total cases in the week ending 5 March – with fears the BA.2 Omicron subvariant could further accelerate transmission. Teens were the highest represented age group, with almost 18,000 testing positive over the week – up from 12,000 the week before. Teachers and students in NSW had been required to do two rapid tests a week at the start of term, alongside the separation of year levels to minimise socialising and indoor mask-wearing. President of the NSW Teachers Federation, Angelo Gavrielatos, criticised the government for removing mitigation strategies too quickly and said health advice “should prevail”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning “It’s putting incredible pressure on our schools because it’s impacting absentee rates, not only of kids but of teachers. “There should have been a steady graduated lifting of the risk mitigation strategies in order to monitor how each mitigation strategy was impacting our schools.” The education department said it was auditing the number of rapid tests it had on hand in case surveillance testing was reintroduced. But the department confirmed it would not reintroduce mask mandates in schools, unless the measure was reintroduced for the general public. “Should the broader community settings for indoor mask-wearing change, we will continue to work closely with NSW Health to develop appropriate measures.” The state’s health minister, Brad Hazzard, has repeatedly stated reintroducing lockdowns and other infection control measures was not his preference, instead encouraging people to get their boosters. “Everybody is over it, putting it bluntly,” he said on Monday morning. Hazzard said it was an absolute necessity for people to get the booster as soon as they could, with about 2 million eligible residents still yet to receive a third dose. “That is the big problem,” Hazzard said. He said it was likely the rate of infection would increase and more people would die. “But we have to balance mental health issues, the economic issues, young people having their cognitive development, being able to go to school, all of the things which have been so destructive for two years,” he said. However, Egan said he was still worried about the impact of Covid on the longer-term educational outcomes of students thanks to rising absenteeism and the lack of trained teachers.",News/Australia news,NSW school returns to remote learning as spiralling Covid cases hit classrooms,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/mar/15/nsw-education-officials-unmoved-on-return-of-masks-in-schools-despite-surging-covid-infections
