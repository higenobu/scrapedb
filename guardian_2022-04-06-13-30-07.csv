4/6/2022,"Rain has returned to large swathes of New South Wales with multiple flash flooding and severe weather warnings in place over the next three days, as Sydney records five times as much rain as London in the past six months. Six-hourly rainfall totals could reach 140mm in parts of the NSW south coast on Wednesday afternoon, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. After a brief respite from wet weather, NSW is expected to cop a drenching on Thursday, when six-hourly totals of up to 140mm could fall across metropolitan Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Central Coast, the south coast and the Illawarra. Isolated local rains of up to 300mm could fall over the course of Thursday in some areas, however the broader weather warning is that flash flooding can occur with far less rainfall due to the already-soaked soil across much of the state. The severe weather warning for heavy rainfall is in place for people in metropolitan Sydney, the Illawarra and the south coast, as well as parts of the Hunter and central and southern tablelands. The Bureau of Meteorology have issued a Severe Weather Warning for HEAVY RAINFALL for people in Metro, Illawarra, South Coast and parts of Hunter, Central Tablelands and Southern Tablelands Forecast Districts.Warning: https://t.co/X2RWJgkdloPrepare: https://t.co/X0LgUewhlP pic.twitter.com/wLombqLyOG Heavy rain will continue on Friday morning, with BoM forecaster Morgan Pumpa warning the current weather – caused by a deepening trough – could extend into much of next week. “It’s been so wet this year that the chance of flash flooding is possible, and it’s increased by heavy and persistent rain,” he said. “Things are already so wet, the ground is saturated, so it won’t take much heavy rainfall at all to cause flash flooding.” Moderate flood warnings are in place for certain areas, including around the Hawkesbury, Nepean and Wollombi rivers. Pumpa noted that flooding predictions could worsen in coming days. Landslips could also occur, the BoM is warning, with a waterlogged, weaker terrain across much of the state increasing the risk. Earlier this week, a British father and son died from a landslide on a walking track in the Blue Mountains. The State Emergency Services NSW, in a post on its Facebook page, urged residents to prepare for flash flooding, landslips and falling trees. In the six months to the end of March, Sydney’s Observatory Hill weather station recorded 1,400.6mm of rain; this included the wettest start to a year since records began in 1859, with 554mm record in March alone. Sydney’s drenching has prompted comparisons with a notoriously rainy London. London recorded just 267.2mm in the same six-month period. Weatherzone’s Ben Domensino said Sydney regularly received more rainfall than London – slightly under double – each year.

We’ve been stuck in those weather patterns. “Rainfall has been surprisingly heavy even for La Niña, which typically causes heavy rain,” Domensino said.",News/Australia news,More flash flooding and severe weather warnings for NSW as heavy rain returns,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/more-flash-flooding-and-severe-weather-warnings-for-nsw-as-heavy-rain-returns
4/6/2022,"Phone-in voting will be expanded to accommodate people isolating with Covid but the Australian Electoral Commission is warning the process “won’t be smooth”, as surging coronavirus case numbers complicate polling plans on the eve of the federal election. Large numbers of Australians are expected to be in isolation come election day, with the pandemic also preventing AEC staff accessing hospitals and some aged care facilities. The AEC can take postal votes until the Wednesday before polling day. But for those who either contract Covid or are deemed close contacts between the Wednesday and election day, the situation is more complex. Legislation was recently passed to allow the AEC to expand its phone-in voting service, traditionally used for blind or low-vision Australians, to take votes from positive Covid cases. That service took just 2,000 votes last election. With Covid case numbers surging throughout Australia, its capacity will need to increase significantly to deal with those isolating this year. AEC media director Evan Ekin-Smyth said there was “no golden number” on how many Covid positive cases are expected to need the service. Those who test positive will likely be asked to fill out a self-declaration confirming their Covid status, though they may need to provide proof. Australians without Covid should not assume they can use phone voting, or that it will be easier than turning up to a polling place, Ekin-Smyth said. “I think the thing to say here as well is that it won’t be smooth,” he said. “This is an emergency provision, we’ve only just had legislation change for this. “We’re scaling up what was otherwise a small service. So if people are thinking that they’re going to use this service because ‘hey, I want to do it on the phone instead of turning up in person’, that is not what it’s about. You’ll wait longer on the phone than you will at a polling place.” Voters who call in will be first asked to register, marked off the roll, and then given a code. On a separate call, they will use that code to vote. “The idea being that it maintains the fact that you get an anonymous, secret vote,” Ekin-Smyth said. The AEC is working with state and territories to send text messages to positive Covid cases, informing them of the need to either postal vote prior to the Wednesday in election week, or use the phone-in service if they test positive after Wednesday. The AEC is still determining which states and territories will allow Covid close contacts exemptions from their isolation to vote in person, should they record a negative rapid test. For those who do attend the polling place in person, Covid precautions will be in force, including social distancing and hand sanitiser, and staff will be wearing masks. Additional staff will be employed, including queue controllers and hygiene officers. The process of voting itself will also be as Covid-safe as possible. The usual order of pencils has increased from 100,000 to 4.5m. Each pencil will be sanitised between use. Polling booths will be wiped down and new plastic inserts will be used to place ballot papers on. “In each voting screen, which is the surface you put your ballot paper down on, we’ll have little plastic inserts,” Ekin-Smyth said. “So once a voter leaves, that plastic insert will get sprayed and wiped before the next voter comes down.” Ekin-Smyth says the AEC is expecting an increase in postal voting, and already had plans to increase capacity well before the pandemic. But he said the surge in postal voting might not be “quite as significant as some people expect”. Hospitals will be off-limits to mobile AEC teams, as will some aged care facilities. “Some [aged care facilities] we’ll be doing mobile, some we won’t,” he said. “We’re contacting individual places to see if they’re set up for it and comfortable having us there, and if they’re not, we’re supporting them for postal voting.”",News/Australia news,Australian election phone voting ‘won’t be smooth’ as Covid surge wreaks havoc on poll,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/apr/06/australian-election-phone-voting-wont-be-smooth-as-covid-surge-wreaks-havoc-on-poll
4/6/2022,"Sewage has become a major battleground in the local elections in so-called “blue wall” seats, where the Liberal Democrats are challenging the Conservatives, from Guildford to Cambridgeshire. The Lib Dems have put eliminating sewage dumps at the heart of their campaign, with the party leader, Ed Davey, planning to launch their fight at the River Wandle in Wimbledon on Wednesday. He is calling for a tax on sewage companies to fund the clean up of local rivers, which can see waste pumped out into the environment when there is heavy rainfall. The Tories have been under huge public pressure over the issue since the government rejected a House of Lords amendment to put a legal duty on water companies to phase out pumping waste into rivers last autumn. However, in a sign of how contested the issue has become, some Tory election material on social media has misleadingly accused the Lib Dems of “voting against a legal duty to clean up rivers”. Lib Dem MPs opposed the government’s plans in favour of stronger legal duties backed by opposition parties. A Liberal Democrat source said: “Conservative MPs are clearly running scared of the huge public backlash over sewage. Their desperate new social media tactics just won’t cut it.” The Lib Dems said internal polling commissioned by the party suggests that sewage dumping is one of the top issues likely to persuade traditional Conservative voters to no longer vote for the party. Another poll for the party showed that 36% of UK voters said they would be less likely to vote for an MP who did not support a ban on raw sewage dumped in rivers, rising to 41% of those who voted Conservative in 2019. Launching the campaign, Davey said: “Conservative MPs have voted time after time to let water companies keep on pumping their filthy sewage straight into our rivers. Rivers like the Wandle in Wimbledon, which now has the worst ecological rating possible. Meanwhile, water company bosses are pocketing millions of pounds in bonuses. All that must change. “Every vote for the Liberal Democrats counts. It sends a message to the Conservatives that they can’t keep failing our NHS. They can’t keep hitting families with unfair tax rises and they can’t keep pumping sewage into our rivers.” A Conservative spokesperson disputed the Lib Dem claims about sewage and repeated their claim that the Lib Dems had voted against government measures to clamp down on sewage discharges. “Lib Dem claims about sewage are even less trustworthy than the bar charts on their leaflets,” the spokesperson said. “While we are taking practical steps to tackle the problem, Lib Dem plans would not have stopped sewage discharges and could cost every household more than £25,000.” In fact, opposition parties, including Labour and the Lib Dems, voted for a House of Lords amendment to the environment bill last October that would have placed a legal duty on water companies not to pump raw waste into rivers, which was voted down by Tory MPs. It would have introduced a requirement for sewage companies to “take all reasonable steps to ensure untreated sewage is not discharged from storm overflows” and to “demonstrate improvements in the sewerage systems”. The government argued that its own version of the amendment was strong enough, with a promise to reduce the number of “storm overflow discharges”, and won22 Tory would-be rebels. Ministers said their plan “represents a major improvement on the status quo” and argued that “complete elimination of sewage discharges through storm overflows in England, which many are calling for more broadly, is likely to cost between approximately £350bn and £600bn”. In 2020, water companies released raw sewage into rivers more than 400,000 times over a total of 3.1m hours. The release of raw sewage via storm overflows is legal in exceptional circumstances such as extreme rain, but figures show that in many cases such discharges are happening more routinely.",News/Environment,Lib Dems put sewage at heart of campaign as party eyes ‘blue wall’ seats,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/06/lib-dems-put-sewage-at-heart-of-campaign-as-party-eyes-blue-wall-seats
