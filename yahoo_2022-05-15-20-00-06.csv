5/15/2022,"Tesla founder Elon Musk revealed that Twitter's sample size to review fake accounts is 100. Musk ""violated"" his NDA by revealing the sample size, he claims he was told by Twitter's legal team. Twitter users are ""being manipulated"" by its algorithm that has ""potential bugs"", he later tweeted. 
Elon Musk claimed that Twitter's legal team told him he has broken the terms of his non-disclosure agreement after revealing the company's sample size to review fake accounts. Twitter announced a deal to sell the company to the Tesla founder on April 25. But Musk said on Friday that his $44 billion takeover is ""temporarily on hold"" while he awaits clarity about the number of spam accounts.

In a tweet on Saturday, Musk said his team would run its own random sample of 100 Twitter accounts, revealing on Twitter that he chose 100 random accounts to gauge the number of spam accounts as ""that is what Twitter uses to calculate <5% fake/spam/duplicate"" accounts. Revealing Twitter's sample size appears to have landed Musk in hot water as he said on Saturday that sharing this information meant he had ""violated"" his non-disclosure agreement, Twitter's legal team had told him.

Musk has since appeared to take aim at Twitter's algorithm, telling users they are ""being manipulated"" and warning of ""potential bugs"" in its code. 
The billionaire later clarified: ""I'm not suggesting malice in the algorithm, but rather that it's trying to guess what you might want to read and, in doing so, inadvertently manipulate/amplify your viewpoints without you realizing this is happening"".

The SpaceX founder and chief executive appeared to have turned his attention back to the rocket company as he met with Indonesian president Joko Widodo on Saturday at its site in Boca Chica, Texas. Musk reportedly told Widodo that he would ""hopefully"" visit Indonesia in November to discuss investment opportunities in the country which has a wealth of natural resources including nickel, copper and tin.

5/15/2022,"Former President Donald Trump spoke to a crowd shortly after the Buffalo mass shooting on Saturday night. He used the shooting to boast about the lack of US deaths in Afghanistan during his presidency. The boast is misleading. There were several US military deaths throughout Trump's time in office. Former President Donald Trump used the racially-motivated Buffalo mass shooting to make a misleading boast about the lack of deaths in Afghanistan during his presidency, a video shows. Speaking in Austin, Texas, on Saturday, the former president took to the stage shortly after an 18-year-old opened fire on customers and employees, killing 10 at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York. —Acyn (@Acyn) May 14, 2022 ""I think they had a tragic event in Buffalo, just as I'm coming on the stage, tragic event in Buffalo with numerous people being killed,"" Trump said, per the video. ""In 18 months in Afghanistan, we lost nobody,"" the former president continued in an apparent non-sequitur. He went on to talk about negotiating with Abdul Ghani Baradar — the co-founder of the Taliban. Trump's claim that nobody died in Afghanistan during 18 months of his presidency is misleading. It's not clear which 18-month period Trump was referring to. Insider reached out to Trump's post-presidency office for clarification but received no response. He may have been referring to claims popularized on social media, described by USA TODAY, in which Trump supporters said there were no US military deaths between February 2020 and August 2021. According to a USA TODAY fact check, these claims are misleading. There were four US deaths recorded in Afghanistan during that period, according to the Pentagon's casualty tracking system, per USA Today, though not in combat situations. Eight of those months were during President Joe Biden's time in office. If Trump was referring to the last 18 months of his presidency, a period between July 2019 and January 2021, this is also factually incorrect. In 2020, 11 military deaths were recorded in Afghanistan. Throughout the final 18 months of Trump's presidency, a total of 22 US service members were reported dead in Afghanistan. Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California criticized Trump's comment in a tweet on Saturday night. ""This is a ridiculous comparison by the former President,"" Lieu, an Air Force Reserve Command colonel, wrote. ""Also, Trump is a liar and disrespects the 64 brave US servicemembers who died under his watch in Afghanistan by ignoring their deaths in his statement: 11 in 2020; 24 in 2019; 14 in 2018; 15 in 2017.""

5/15/2022,"Mobile home parks have been a reliable source of affordable housing in Charlotte for decades, offering prices well below nearby apartments or homes. But a confluence of factors, including rising land prices and an influx of investors looking to make money buying parks, threaten this way of life. New reporting and data analysis from The Charlotte Observer shows how in the middle of the city’s widening affordable housing crisis, this remaining refuge has come under siege. Part 1: Mobile home parks in Charlotte under threat — for reasons all too familiar Part 2: ‘Just blows my mind.’ Charlotte family forced to leave home of 50 years Part 3: Developers are gobbling up mobile home parks. Can residents buy them first? Part 4: Here’s who has been buying up mobile home parks in Charlotte For the first time in a half-century, Stacy Sprinkle’s family soon won’t call Countrywoods Mobile Home Park home. She’s watched the community in north Charlotte grow and change since her father bought the two-bedroom, one bathroom home in 1972 when she was 13. Since then, she’s lived here several times, most recently moving back in to care for her elderly mother. The park off W.T. Harris Boulevard and Old Statesville Road was close-knit and affordable, Sprinkle said. Many families had lived there a decade or more. “It was a lot of neighbors,” she said. “Everybody knew each other’s kids or friends.” But in August, the park sold to Raleigh-based Countrywoods Community LLC, which is connected to an upstate New York firm that owns several mobile home parks. First, the company raised lot rents, but initially reassured residents they wouldn’t have to move if they kept paying. Then, the notices started arrived stating their month-to-month leases wouldn’t be renewed. Everyone had to go. Sprinkle says they’ve paid their lot rent faithfully, even as the most recent increase to $407 per month stretched their budget that’s mostly covered by her and her mother’s Social Security benefits. The rest of the two dozen families at Countrywoods, who didn’t own their home like Sprinkle’s does but rented both their spot and their residences, also were told earlier this year their leases wouldn’t renewed. Sprinkle, 63, has watched family after family move out, with an end-of-May deadline. “I will probably be the last (to leave),” she said, surveying the now-empty park on a recent afternoon, where few remnants of life remain. What’s left: Christmas lights hanging from empty homes. Children’s bikes out front. Potted plants baked by the sun. Where there were once rows of rectangular houses there are now a combination of deserted homes yet to be demolished, freshly overturned soil where those already torn down once stood, and new, larger and more expensive manufactured homes that will replace them. “It just blows my mind,” she said. “Before people rented here and it was affordable to us. Most of us don’t have a lot of money,” she said of Countrywoods’ residents. “Then they move these new trailers in, and wow,” she said. “It’s something to see this after all these years.” Representatives with KDM Development, the New York firm, did not respond to phone or emailed requests for comment. Mobile home communities have become a target for investors and private equity firms as a significant opportunity to profit, experts say, leaving their low-income residents vulnerable to displacement. A review by The Charlotte Observer of local property records shows some 20 parks — or about one-third of those in Mecklenburg County — have changed ownership in the last five years, including several that have been purchased by out-of-state companies and large investors. Packing up a half-century of life has been a stressful endeavor, she said. Most of the family photos, showing generations of special occasions and everyday life, are already off the walls. Moving boxes are piled in the living room, where Sprinkle sleeps on the couch or an air mattress so her mother and son can take each of the bedrooms. “It’s been rough,” she said. “It’s been a lot of stress and tension.” Sprinkle mourns the improvements they’d painstakingly saved for that they won’t be able to keep — new floors in the kitchen and hallway, and repairs to the bathroom to be more accessible for her 82-year-old mother. Even though the family owns their home outright, they can’t take it with them. Mobile homes built before 1976 can’t be relocated, according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development code that set construction and safety standards for manufactured housing. Although residents often use the terms mobile, manufactured, or sometimes trailer homes somewhat interchangeably, those classifications matter. Anything built after 1976 is a manufactured home and can be relocated. Sprinkle’s is not. “It can’t be moved,” she said. “I wish; (there are) memories in it.” Now Sprinkle is working to buy a neighboring manufactured home that a former Countrywoods resident had rented, rushing to get the permits and funds together to move it to a nearby park. But it comes at a price. It can cost between $5,000 to $10,000 to move the home and reestablish water, sewer and other services to make it livable. That will come from money Sprinkle was saving for a new car. She plans to stay until the very end of the month in her family’s home. “I’m staying until the very last minute,” she said.
