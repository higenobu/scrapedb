2/28/2022,"This week, standard sports commentary and common lexicon has seemed extra jarring and ill advised. The idea of teams “battling” each other feels suddenly insensitive. The Hawthorn Football Club women’s football department welcomed two new players to their “army” this week and the Richmond Football Club continued its usual calls to engage the “Tiger Army”. I cringed at the social media posts of actual armies marching into actual battle that ran alongside footy tweets in my timeline. It’s a strange time to be a sports fan. Around the world sporting organisations scramble to manage the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Matches have been cancelled or boycotted, tournaments are being moved and club owners are stepping down. Sport has always been a mirror reflecting the complex nature of our world – and our politics. Cue the AFLW’s Indigenous round. In its second year of official celebration and much like its sibling Sir Doug Nicholls Round in the AFLM, Indigenous round is one of the best examples of how to celebrate communities and cultures through sport. It is also one of the few times in sport – Pride Round being the other – that we see anything close to intersectionality even blinked at. In an Australian sports landscape that continues to be extraordinarily white washed despite the numbers of culturally diverse and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities that love and play sport, Indigenous round continues to be that one moment in a season where we seem to get it right. Considering current global events, it would be easy to eye roll at the ever growing “performance” that are the themed rounds. As celebration video after celebration video is released with such speed and volume that it feels like clubs are falling over themselves to signal engagement and connection, the cynic in me thinks about the wizards, behind the smoke and mirrors at AFL House, pulling all the levers. But with invasion of an indigenous land by an outside military force the backdrop, and with yet another International Women’s Day imminent, the AFLW’s Indigenous round seems to be painfully poignant this year. At a time when it is too easy to fall into despair and cynicism, and when so many are asking “what does any of this even mean?”, Indigenous round is a reminder that stopping to connect, acknowledge culture and platform First Nations communities – women in particular – is in itself healing. Sitting down to watch the footy this weekend felt like a balm. In promotion of the round, Tanya Hosch, the AFL’s executive general manager of inclusion and social policy, described it as “a powerful platform in highlighting the importance of understanding inclusion and respect of Indigenous peoples, cultures…” In that aim the themed round has been a resounding success. In promotional videos from the league and clubs the words “educate”, “represent” and “connect” are repeated over and over. Whether it is the platforming of artists like Rubii Red, Chantelle Mitchell and others who have designed jumpers this year, or the celebration of Meriam Mir woman Alicia Janz as Indigneous round honouree, or the emotional Kaitlyn Ashmore talking about her struggles with mental health, deep connection and honest celebration is happening across the AFLW. And that is a win. Hosch also spoke of the round as a symbol of the AFL’s commitment to ensuring Indigenous communities “have the same access and opportunities” in the game. On that front, while gains are being made, there is still a long way to go. The challenge ahead for the AFLW lies in creating unique pathways that will reach out to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in order to filter grassroots participation into pathway systems. We know in both the men’s and women’s competitions the existing systems do not work for communities on the margins. The AFLW National Championships – having flexed and pivoted during the pandemic – continues, but the Woomeras v Medleys game – the “diversity” talent game that brings together Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander players with other culturally diverse players – is yet to be confirmed. As with many sports, these sorts of programmes have taken the biggest hits due to Covid-19. The AFLW suffers in comparison to AFLM when it comes to resourcing and the ability to hub and be flexible, and bespoke diversity pathways similarly crumble at the sign of any stretch – whether it be due to health, economic or cultural reasons. Regardless of the work ahead, if ever there was a time to reconnect with the true spirit of recognising and celebrating our Indigenous peoples, it is now. If sport does in fact hold up a mirror to society, Indigenous round shows we are willing to come to the party, but perhaps are not prepared to stick around for the clean up. Or not yet. As Noongar woman and Western Bulldogs development coach, Kirby Bentley, reminded us via a video of her addressing her team: “Do you know where AFL was invented?... Our mob, right? We started it with a possum [fur ball] kicking it around...”. Lest we forget our own history of invasion and erasure.",Sport/Sport,Amid despair and cynicism the AFLW’s Indigenous round was painfully poignant | Rana Hussain,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/28/amid-despair-and-cynicism-the-aflws-indigenous-round-was-painfully-poignant
2/28/2022,"“This is the biggest participation sport in the country [for women]. Everyone’s going to press the button to download it, then watch it for free. For God’s sake, let’s go.” Amid the self-congratulatory speeches at the launch of this year’s Super Netball season at Crown Melbourne, a comment by Foxtel Group chief executive Patrick Delany revealed a tension familiar to sporting administrators. Those remarks last week by the boss of the league’s new broadcast partner – referring to fans being able to watch games free each Sunday via Kayo Freebies – ostensibly laid much of the potential success or failure of the five-year deal at the feet of another party; the tens of thousands of Australians who play netball, but historically haven’t watched it. Throwaway line or not, it felt a little pre-emptively accusatory, especially given the myriad challenges facing codes in even getting a season run and won in Covid times. Then, of course, there is Fox’s role in attracting that grassroots netball cohort long considered an untapped market, as well as new viewers on a platform that is vastly different to free-to-air TV – the league’s home for five years. Netball Australia chief executive Kelly Ryan did not quite know how to follow Delany’s call to arms at the launch but said Super Netball was determined to “continue to realise its absolute potential as a tier-one sport”, including by finding new ways with Fox to present the sport. “Additional content shows is something we asked Fox for, and they said absolutely no problems,” Ryan said. “We said, ‘can you broadcast all games every weekend?’ They said absolutely no problems. We said, ‘can you change the time slots so they’re not in the middle of a Saturday when our entire participation base is actually playing the sport?’ And they said no problems. “‘Can you make sure that every Sunday is free and accessible to anybody that wants to watch it?’ Absolutely no problems. To say that we’re excited about starting this partnership is an understatement.” With the pre-season Team Girls Cup played in Melbourne at the weekend – the first time the tournament has been held since 2019 – that partnership was on show for the first time and it became clear what issues (beyond fans simply pressing a button) the league will manage in 2022. Principally, predictably, is the ongoing impact of Covid. Before the tournament even began on Friday the reigning premiers, the NSW Swifts, revealed their coach Briony Akle would not travel after being identified as a close contact and having to isolate. By Sunday afternoon, with their replacement coach Bec Bulley ill, two injured players, shooters Helen Housby and Sam Wallace, coached the nine-woman Swifts to a 41/27 drubbing at the hands of the Giants in the fight for last place. Other clubs were also impacted by isolation. Pre-season tournament or not, it was a terrible look for the league and something that could be repeated during the season given match-day squads remain at 10 contracted players and do not include training partners. Swifts co-captain Paige Hadley and Collingwood star Kelsey Browne have both called on extended squads to be introduced for the season, which begins on March 26. The Swifts have four teammates who live together and another three in one household, Hadley explained. “It is nerve-racking,” she said. “We could lose three players [in one go] with a close contact and that leaves you with seven players for a match. I’d like to see extended squads for sure.” With Collingwood having already had a pre-season match cancelled after Covid decimated the Queensland Firebirds, Browne too wants clubs to have more players to select from. “We saw with the Firebirds, one person had it, they trained with the team, and then three more people had it … it’s so contagious,” she said. “If there’s any year that we see extended squads, I would love for it to be this year.” How the league approaches Covid-enforced forfeits is another key question, especially given the fixture was built to end in early July to accommodate the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham, leaving little room for re-fixturing. On the court, a scary-good Melbourne Vixens side, without their starting shooters Mwai Kumwenda, who was isolating, and star recruit Keira Austin, who is still working her way back from ACL surgery, won the pre-season trophy without dropping a game. The Victorians, who won the premiership in 2020 but fell to last in 2021 after losing Liz Watson to injury, beat the West Coast Fever 45-43 thanks mainly to steady-headed youngster Rahni Samason, who shot 30/37, and the midcourt dominance of co-captains Watson and MVP Kate Moloney. The surprise packet of the tournament was the Adelaide Thunderbirds, who beat the Pies and Giants in early rounds before taking third place with a dominant win over Sunshine Coast Lightning 53/32.",Sport/Sport,Pressure on Super Netball to thrive as Fox Sports plays ‘participation’ card | Erin Delahunty,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/feb/28/pressure-on-super-netball-to-thrive-as-fox-sports-plays-participation-card
2/28/2022,"The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has warned Australians from travelling to Ukraine to help fight the Russian invasion, as the country begins assembling a new foreign legion made up of “friends of peace and democracy”. The caution not to travel into the conflict zone comes as the Australian government confirms it will send an initial $4m in funding for military assistance to Ukrainian forces, which will be used for nonlethal military equipment and medical supplies. A further sum for Nato’s Ukrainian trust fund is being finalised for “lethal aid”, which will go towards the supply of weapons to Ukrainian fighters, as well as potential support for cyber-attacks. On Sunday, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said a new foreign legion for international volunteers was being assembled, with an appeal for anyone in the global community interested in fighting for democracy to join. “This is the beginning of a war against Europe, against European structures, against democracy, against basic human rights, against a global order of law, rules and peaceful coexistence,” Zelenskiy said. “Anyone who wants to join the defence of Ukraine, Europe and the world can come and fight side by side with the Ukrainians against the Russian war criminals.” But Morrison said the government’s clear advice was not to travel to Ukraine, and said the legalities of whether citizens could join Zelenskiy’s proposed foreign legion were “unclear”. “This is a complicated situation, and at present it is still somewhat unclear what the president of Ukraine has proposed,” Morrison said. “Our law sets out arrangements where people can be involved in official activity by a sovereign state, which Ukraine obviously qualifies for, but the nature of these arrangements are very uncertain.” “I would stress this: our travel advice to all Australians is do not travel to Ukraine, that is the Australian government’s advice for all Australians ... [and] I would counsel against making assumptions about the legality of such activity at this point given the uncertainties that are associated with the arrangements and the force that President Zelenskiy is putting in place. “I can understand absolutely the strong feelings and the motivations for people to go and do that, but I would say at this time the legality of such actions are uncertain under Australian law.” The treasurer Josh Frydenberg said that under Australian law, citizens could not go and fight in a conflict zone, “unless they’re fighting with a foreign government and a foreign army”. “Do not go into the conflict zone,” he told ABC radio. “Under Australian law, Australian citizens cannot go and fight in conflict zones, but we have very clear travel advice ... please do not travel into a conflict zone.” By contrast, the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said on the weekend that British citizens who wanted to join the fight in Ukraine would “absolutely” have her support. Under the Criminal Code, it is an offence for an Australian to enter a foreign country with the intention of engaging in hostile activity, unless it is done as part of “the person’s service in any capacity in or with the armed forces of the government of a foreign country”. There is a second exemption for another armed force, but only if the government makes a specific declaration covering that person and their circumstances. On Monday, Morrison said details of the lethal aid package were being finalised with Nato, along with a package of humanitarian assistance. “We’re working that through with our Nato partners now. The most effective way to do that is through them and their supply chains and their ways of getting that into Ukraine,” Morrison told 4BC radio. He said the humanitarian package would be “significant” and would assist Poland and other neighbouring countries manage the large number of refugees fleeing Ukraine. The United Nations estimates that at least 368,000 people have already fled their homes in Ukraine, with as many as 4.5 million to follow if the fighting continues to spread. Waits of up to 70 hours have been reported at some of the nine border crossings into Poland, due to the sheer volume of people attempting to leave, and as Ukrainian officials attempt to stop men aged between 16 and 60 from leaving the country. Morrison also criticised the “reckless” threat from Russia to put its nuclear deterrence forces on high alert, and said the response from the international community demonstrated that the invasion had “focused the minds of the world”. “I think the advance in Ukraine has not gone to quite the timetable or plan that I think Russia expected. And I think the world’s response has been swift and has been significant,” he said. “There are those autocratic bullying states and there are liberal democracies who aren’t going to stand for it. And so I think the bravery and courage we’ve seen from the Ukrainian people has been extraordinary.” Frydenberg said that Australia was concerned that the invasion into Ukraine was just the first step for president Vladimir Putin’s expansionist plans. “Vladimir Putin starts with Ukraine, but who’s next? That is the question,” he said. “This is the first major interstate conflict within Europe since the Nazis were defeated. This is a direct challenge to the international rules-based order that has underpinned prosperity in Europe for more than 70 years.” A raft of sanctions imposed by the Australian government came into effect at midnight on Sunday, including financial sanctions and travel bans on Putin and remaining permanent members of Russia’s security council: foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, defence minister Sergei Shoigu, prime minister Mikhail Mishustin and internal affairs minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev. “President Putin, foreign minister Lavrov and defence minister Shoigu are directly responsible for Russia’s unprovoked and unlawful further invasion of Ukraine,” the government said in a joint statement from Morrison, Frydenberg, the foreign affairs minister Marise Payne and defence minister Peter Dutton. “It is exceedingly rare to designate a head of state, and reflects the depth of our concerns.” Other leaders who have faced similar sanctions in the past include Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Muammar Gaddafi of Libya and Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Australia has so far sanctioned more than 350 Russian individuals and 13 Belarusians who the government say are “facilitating Putin’s illegal and violent ambitions”.",News/Australia news,‘Do not go’: Australians warned against travelling to Ukraine to fight Russian invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/do-not-go-australians-warned-against-travelling-to-ukraine-to-fight-russian-invasion
2/28/2022,"When flood water retreats, it leaves a stench; stale mud caked into the street, into the floorboards and up the walls. In Brisbane two separate flood stories are unfolding on Monday morning. As the Brisbane River peaks, many of the surrounding areas, including parts of the city centre, are expected to be inundated. At the same time, suburban areas that were flooded on Sunday, mainly from tributary creeks, have been given some respite after the torrential rain stopped about midnight. The flood threat is not over but the morning has presented an opportunity for many to return home and assess the damage. “We left about 3pm yesterday, the water was up to here,” said Nirin Giri, pointing to a spot just below the front balcony of his home at Newmarket, in Brisbane’s inner north. The surrounding houses on Ashgrove Avenue, near the bridge over Enoggera Creek, all suffered significant damage. The water overturned a large garden shed in a neighbour’s yard. Giri said his family left to stay with relatives. About 6.30am he walked through the house, which had about 30cm of water above the floor, before attempting to hose out some of the mud. “There’s mud right through, you can see it has come right up along the wall there,” he said. “We are not alone, this has happened to everybody.” The sorts of items claimed by the rising flood on Sunday – ladders, a massive water tank, white goods, garden fences, children’s toys – were indiscriminately scattered as it receded. Megan Smit has begun the task of clearing rubbish, old items and mud from underneath her home in Wilston. “There’s still a bit of water in there,” she said, “but it’s now gone down enough to retrieve some things. We’ll see what’s salvageable and what’s not.” Smit’s home is a Queensland workers’ cottage; unlike many others in her street, it does not have living areas or bedrooms built in underneath the main floor. “I guess we’re lucky. I was thinking we should do that, build another couple of bedrooms under there. We only used it for storage for laundry, thankfully.” As the suburban clean-up continues, flood waters have started to invade Brisbane’s central business district and riverfront areas. When more than three days of unabated heavy rainfall ended in Brisbane about midnight, storm warnings shifted to Logan, the Gold Coast and northern New South Wales. But concern remains about the potential for river flooding in the Queensland capital, given the extraordinary volume of water in the catchments. Brisbane city council estimates more than 4,500 properties will be flooded by the time the river reaches a 4m peak on Monday, including more than 2,100 homes. Wivenhoe Dam is at 182% capacity and has been strategically releasing water into the system. It is unclear how long those releases may continue. The level of the Enoggera Reservoir, which feeds Enoggera and Breakfast creeks and other suburban waterways, has dropped marginally but is still more than 200% full. More than 4bn litres will continue to flow into the creek system until the reservoir spillway kicks in.",News/Australia news,Queensland floods: clean-up begins for some Brisbane residents while others brace for river’s peak,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/queensland-flood-brisbane-floods-2022-qld-bne-river-peak
2/28/2022,"A man is missing and hundreds of residents of Lismore are in need of rescue as the New South Wales regional city has been hit by the worst flood in its history. The rapidly rising flood water has left many in the regional city in northern NSW stranded on their rooftops and forced to put out calls for help on social media after the State Emergency Service was overrun. One of those who needed rescuing included NSW Labor MP Janelle Saffin, who was forced to swim to safety as the flood water rose rapidly and quickly engulfed her home. “It just rose up at enormous speed,” Saffin said. “We were on the veranda, hanging on the rafters and it was coming over. There was only a little gap so we thought, ‘OK, we have one choice.’ That was: go.” Saffin said she swum a short distance before fighting what appeared to be a tyre beneath a tree which she held on to until an electorate officer arrived in a canoe. “He was coming and I said go after this other lady who was screaming out.” Incoming NSW Greens upper house member and Lismore resident Sue Higginson said that while she had evacuated on Sunday night, many of her friends stayed behind and were now trapped. “In Lismore, we do floods. This is not a flood, it’s a catastrophe,” Higginson said. “This is climate change. My friends are now risking their lives, they’re going from roof to roof and they’re picking up traumatised, screaming people. “There’s just not enough boats.” Higginson said people of the city had been warned but many did not understand the danger. “People got peppered with warnings, but the warnings were too conservative, too slow,” Higginson said. “It wasn’t until about midnight that they started talking about flood levels higher than 1974.” NSW SES gave the order to evacuate the city around 2am, telling residents flood waters were rising rapidly and that the Lismore levee was expected to overtop. Flood water broke through the levee after 3am and began rapidly filling Lismore’s streets, cutting many off and prompting 374 calls for help within 30 minutes. Social media has recorded hundreds of calls for help since, with SES calling those with boats to report to their local station to assist but not to do so alone. Flood water is dangerous as it is not always clear how deep it is and the muddy water obscures power lines, cars, debris and other hazards. Meanwhile NSW police were forced to break off a search for a man believed lost in flood water yesterday afternoon. Officers responded to calls for help but quickly lost sight of the man. Despite a search of the area with the NSW SES, he could not be found and the effort had to be called off as flood waters continued to rise. The search was set to continue on Monday. Saffin said she had spoken with the NSW premier and other elected representatives, and was now working to connect those who needed help or rescue with those who could provide it. “We just all have to muck in and help,” Saffin said. “I want people – I know people are worried, I know people are scared, and I want to let them know we’re here trying to do what we can to support you.” The Bureau of Meteorology said flood waters in the Wilsons River were expected to reach a peak at 14.20m on Monday afternoon, higher than the 12.15m levels recorded in March 1974 and the 12.27m in February 1954. Readings from the bureau’s monitoring station on the Wilsons River showed the river height approaching 15m but looked to be tapering off with rain expected to keep falling through Monday. Approximately 40,000 people live in the catchment area around Lismore. As locals compared the feeling of catastrophe in Lismore to that during the black summer bushfires, Keith Williams, a Ballina shire councillor who oversaw water management in the region, said “the word unprecedented doesn’t seem like a big enough word”. “We’ve not seen this before, it’s off the charts,” Williams said. “I’m just constantly hearing reports of people standing on furniture, standing on roofs waiting for rescues. “This is the most serious situation we have ever faced in terms of flooding in Lismore and the number of people who have been affected.” Williams said Lismore sits at the joining point between Wilsons River and Leycester Creek. Normally floods occur when one is at record levels but because the current deluge is hitting both sides of the catchment, it is causing both to flood simultaneously. “Right off the bat, a dam isn’t going to make any difference at this point in time, What’s happening in Lismore, it would be a tiny speck on an absolute deluge,” Williams said.",News/Australia news,Lismore flood: hundreds rescued and thousands evacuated as NSW city hit by worst flood in history ,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/feb/28/lismore-flood-worst-history-nsw-floods-2022-rescued-evacuated
